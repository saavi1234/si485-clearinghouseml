    "state": "California",
    "summary": "<p>On May 4, 2017, President Trump issued an executive order seeking to &ldquo;restore religious freedom.&rdquo; The order suggested that federal agencies amend regulations about the preventative care mandate of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to increase the pool of employers allowed to claim an exemption from providing contraceptive coverage. The agencies then issued two Interim Final Rules (IFRs) expanding the scope of the religious and moral exemptions. Any employer or health insurer with religious or moral objections could opt out of the ACA's contraceptive-coverage requirement with no automatic way for women to continue to receive contraception if their employers opted out and with no required federal government oversight.</p>\r\n<p>On October 6, 2017, California filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The state challenged the IFRs by suing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Labor, and the U.S. Department of the Treasury under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 551 et seq.). Seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, the state claimed that the IFRs drastically reduced women&rsquo;s access to contraceptive coverage and violated the APA, the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Specifically, they alleged that the defendants had failed to provide notice and comment as required by the APA and that the IFRs exceeded their statutory authority under the ACA. On November 1, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which added Delaware, Maryland, New York, and Virginia as plaintiffs.</p>\r\n<p>On November 9, 2017, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin implementation of the IFRs and preserve the status quo pending litigation.</p>\r\n<p>On December 21, 2017, District Judge Haywood S. Gilliam granted the plaintiffs' motion and issued a nationwide injunction enjoining implementation of the IFRs. 281 F. Supp. 3d 806 (N.D. Cal. 2017). The Court found that the plaintiffs were likely to able to show that the process that passed the IFRs bypassed the typical rule-making procedure, violating the APA and causing them imminent harm. The Court noted that the defendants had completely changed their position on contraceptive coverage taken during the litigation of <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13465\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zubik v. Burwell</a>, There, the defendants recognized the need to balance the compelling interest in ensuring that women covered by all health plans received full and equal health coverage (including contraceptive coverage) with the goal of minimizing the burden on religious exercise. Here, however, the defendants refused to recognize any such compelling interest.</p>\r\n<p>On December 29, 2017, Judge Gilliam granted a motion to intervene as a defendant filed by the Little Sisters of the Poor Jeanne Jugan Residence&mdash;a Roman Catholic order of nuns that serves the elderly poor. 2017 WL 6731640. On January 26, 2018, Judge Gilliam also granted the March for Life Education and Defense Fund's motion to intervene as a defendant.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants each appealed the District Court's decision granting the plaintiffs' preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The District Court stayed the proceedings pending resolution of the defendants' appeals.</p>\r\n<p>Once the federal defendants issued Final Rules, set to take effect on January 14, 2019 and largely identical to the IFRs, the plaintiffs argued that these new rules meant that the defendants' appeals were moot. The plaintiffs asked the Court to lift the stay so that they could amend their complaint in order to challenge the final rules. On December 13, 2018, however, Judge Gilliam denied the plaintiffs' motion to lift the stay, holding that it did not have jurisdiction to do so given the broad scope of issues before the Ninth Circuit at that time.</p>\r\n<p>On December 13, 2018, the Ninth Circuit issued its opinion to resolve each of the defendants' appeals (Circuit Judges J. Clifford Wallace, Andrew J. Kleinfeld, and Susan P. Graber). The Court affirmed the preliminary injunction insofar as it barred enforcement of the IFRs in the plaintiff states, but found that the scope of the injunction was over-broad. The Court vacated the portion of the injunction barring enforcement in other states and remanded to the District Court. 911 F.3d 558.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on December 18, 2018, which added Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Minnesota, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington as plaintiffs. The amended complaint alleged that both the IFRs and the Final Rules violated the APA, the Establishment Clause, and the Equal Protection Clause. At that same time, the plaintiffs filed another motion for a preliminary injunction, seeking to enjoin the implementation of the Final Rules.</p>\r\n<p>On December 26, 2018, the federal defendants filed a motion to stay all proceedings given the lapse in appropriations funding for the Department of Justice. In the alternative, they asked for an extension of the deadline to respond to the second amended complaint. Judge Gilliam denied the defendants' motion to stay proceedings given the impending effective date of the Final Rules (January 14), but granted the defendants an extension of time to submit their answer. Judge Gilliam also granted extensions to the Little Sisters and the March for Life.</p>\r\n<p>On January 13, 2019, Judge Gilliam granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. 2019 WL 178555. The Court found that, as to both Final Rules, the plaintiffs had shown that they were likely to succeed, or at a minimum raised serious questions going to the merits, on their claim that the religious and moral exemptions violated the APA. The Court also found that the plaintiffs were likely to suffer irreparable harm as a result of this violation, that the balance of hardships tipped sharply in their favor, and that the public interest favored granting the injunction.</p>\r\n<p>Each of the defendants eventually appealed the District Court's decision to grant the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Gilliam granted Oregon&rsquo;s motion to intervene on February 1, 2019, but rejected Oregon&rsquo;s request for joinder in the original thirteen states&rsquo; preliminary injunction motion because Oregon filed its motion for joinder after the court had already entered its order granting the preliminary injunction motion.</p>\r\n<p>On April 30, 2019 the original thirteen states filed a motion for summary judgment, and Oregon filed a motion for a preliminary injunction of its own. Over the course of the next month, a flurry of amicus curiae briefs were submitted in support of the motion for summary judgment. And on May 31, 2019 the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, for summary judgment.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Gilliam granted Oregon's motion for a preliminary injunction on July 2, 2019.</p>\r\n<p>On October 22, 2019, in an opinion that again addressed each of the defendants' appeals, the 9th Circuit affirmed the preliminary injunction, this time in its entirety. 941 F.3d 410. The defendants appealed to the Supreme Court.</p>\r\n<p>However, Judge Gilliam stayed the case on January 22, 2020 after the Supreme Court granted certiorari in <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17230\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Little Sisters of the Poor v. Pennsylvania</a>. In that case, the district judge had granted a nationwide injunction nearly identical to the nationwide injunction originally issued in this case. However, the Third Circuit had affirmed the nationwide character of the injunction. The Supreme Court ultimately held that the ACA gave the Health Resources and Service Administration the authority to grant exemptions based on employers&rsquo; religious objections to providing no-cost contraceptive coverage for their employees on July 8, 2020. Little Sisters of the Poor, 140 S. Ct. 2367.</p>\r\n<p>Following that decision, the Supreme Court vacated the Ninth Circuit's judgment in this case and remanded. 141 S. Ct. 192. The Ninth Circuit subsequently vacated the preliminary injunction, and remanded back to the district court on October 8, 2020. 977 F.3d 801.</p>\r\n<p>Nevertheless, while the plaintiffs withdrew their statutory authority and procedural claims, the plaintiffs alleged that the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision had not resolved all of their claims. So, on December 4, 2020, D.C. and the original thirteen states plus Oregon and three additional states (Michigan, Nevada, and Colorado, which had filed a motion to intervene in March 2019 that was still under consideration) filed a brief which asserted that because &ldquo;the Exemptions Rules violate the APA in that they are arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law, this Court should grant the States&rsquo; motion for summary judgment and vacate the Rules.&rdquo; Judge Gilliam thus lifted the stay and reopened the case on December 14, 2020.</p>\r\n<p>Following the election of President Joe Biden, the federal defendants sought a stay on March 1, 2021 to allow the new leadership to evaluate the issues of the case. Judge Gillam granted that stay, and continued to extend it while the agencies began a new rulemaking process to amend the 2018 final rules at issue in this case. As of April 26, 2023, the stay is still in effect and the rulemaking process is ongoing, with the parties keeping the court updated via status reports due every three months.

    "summary_short": "In 2017, California (later joined by other states) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs challenged two interim final rules issued by the federal government under the Affordable Care Act that drastically reduced women's access to contraceptive coverage. They alleged that the rules violated the Administrative Procedure Act, the Establishment Clause, and the Equal Protection Clause. In December 2017, the District Court granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction and enjoined the implementation of the IFRs nationwide. The defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit, which affirmed the injunction with respect to the plaintiff states, but vacated and remanded with respect to other states. In January 2019, the District Court granted the plaintiffs' new motion for a preliminary injunction and enjoined implementation of the Final Rules. On appeal, the Supreme Court vacated that decision. The plaintiffs continued to litigate claims that they said the Supreme Court's decision left unresolved. However, following the election of President Joe Biden, the court stayed that litigation to allow the federal agencies to conduct a rulemaking process that would amend the rules at issue. As of April 26, 2023, that rulemaking is ongoing and the case is still stayed.",

No. 28 \nDefendants. \n11 \n   \na  12  I.  INTRODUCTION \ntr in\nuoro 13  Pending before the Court is a motion for a preliminary injunction that would enjoin two \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  interim final rules (“IFRs”) exempting certain entities from the Affordable Care Act’s mandate to \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  employers to provide contraceptive coverage.  Plaintiffs are the states of California, Delaware, \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Maryland, and New York, and the Commonwealth of Virginia.  Defendants are the U.S. \nS d nr\nee 17  Department of Health & Human Services (“HHS”); Secretary of HHS Eric D. Hargan; the U.S. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Department of Labor; Secretary of Labor R. Alexander Acosta; the U.S. Department of the \n19  Treasury; and Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin.     \n20  Defendants begin their brief in opposition to the motion for preliminary injunction with the \n21  contention that “[t]his case is about religious liberty and freedom of conscience.”  Dkt. No. 51 at \n22  1.  And without question, that is one of the important values at issue in this case.  But Defendants’ \n23  characterization leaves out an equally critical aspect of what this case is about.  Since its \n24  enactment, the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) has required group health insurance plans to provide \n25  women access to preventive care, including contraceptives, without imposing any cost sharing \n26  requirement.  Less than two years ago, in April 2016, Defendants (or, in the case of the individual \n27  defendants, their predecessors) represented to the Supreme Court that the United States \n28  Government has a compelling interest in ensuring access to such coverage for women.  See \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 105   Filed 12/21/17   Page 2 of 29\n \n1  Supplemental Br. for Resp’ts at 1, Zubik v. Burwell, 136 S. Ct. 1557 (2016) (per curiam) (No. 14-\n2  1418), 2016 WL 1445915, at *1 (explaining that rules in existence in April 2016 “further[ed] the \n3  compelling interest in ensuring that women covered by every type of health plan receive full and \n4  equal health coverage, including contraceptive coverage”).  Moreover, Defendants have \n5  consistently recognized the need to balance this compelling interest with the important goal of \n6  “minimiz[ing] any burden on religious exercise.”  Id.  \n7  But the Defendants have now changed their position, dramatically.  In the IFRs that \n8  became effective on October 6, 2017, Defendants asserted that there is no such compelling interest \n9  after all.  They also markedly expanded the scope of the exemption available to religious entities \n10  under the ACA’s contraceptive coverage mandate, and created an entirely new exemption based \n11  on moral objections.  In sum, the IFRs represent an abandonment of the Defendants’ prior position \n12  with regard to the contraceptive coverage requirement, and a reversal of their approach to striking \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  the proper balance between substantial governmental and societal interests.  \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  These highly-consequential IFRs were implemented without any prior notice or \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  opportunity to comment.  The Court finds that, at a minimum, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  showing that this process violated the Administrative Procedure Act, and that this violation will \nS d nr\nee 17  cause them imminent harm if enforcement of the IFRs is not enjoined.  Accordingly, for the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  reasons set forth below, Plaintiffs’ motion is GRANTED.   \n19  II.  BACKGROUND \n20  Before turning to Plaintiffs’ challenge to the IFRs at issue in this case, the Court recounts \n21  the sequence of events which began with the enactment of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. \n22  A.  The Affordable Care Act \n23  In March 2010, Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act.  The ACA included a provision \n24  known as the Women’s Health Amendment, which states: \n25  A group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or \nindividual health insurance coverage shall, at a minimum provide \n26  coverage for and shall not impose any cost sharing requirements for \n. . . with respect to women, such additional preventive care and \n27  screenings  .  .  .  as  provided  for  in  comprehensive  guidelines \nsupported by the Health Resources and Services Administration for \n28  purposes of this paragraph. \n2 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 105   Filed 12/21/17   Page 3 of 29\n \n1  42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4).    \n2  B.  The 2010 IFR and Subsequent Regulations \n3  On July 19, 2010, under the authority of the Women’s Health Amendment, several federal \n4  agencies (including HHS, the Department of Labor, and the Department of the Treasury) issued an \n5  interim final rule (“the 2010 IFR”).  See 75 Fed. Reg. 41,726.  It required, in part, that health plans \n6  provide “evidence-informed preventive care” to women, without cost sharing and in compliance \n7  with “comprehensive guidelines” to be provided by HHS’ Health Resources and Services \n8  Administration (“HRSA”).  Id. at 41,728. \n9  The agencies found they had statutory authority “to promulgate any interim final rules that \n10  they determine[d were] appropriate to carry out the” relevant statutory provisions.  Id. at 41,729-\n11  30.  The agencies also determined they had good cause to forgo the general notice of proposed \n12  rulemaking required under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 553.  Id. at \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  41,730.  Specifically, the agencies determined that issuing such notice would be “impracticable \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  and contrary to the public interest” because it would not allow sufficient time for health plans to \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  be timely designed to incorporate the new requirements under the ACA, which were set to go into \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  effect approximately two months later.  Id.  The agencies requested that comments be submitted \nS d nr\nee 17  by September 17, 2010, the date the IFR was scheduled to go into effect. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  On September 17, 2010, the agencies first promulgated regulations pursuant to the 2010 \n19  IFR.  See 45 C.F.R. § 147.310(a)(1)(iv) (HHS); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713 (Department of \n20  Labor); 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713 (Department of the Treasury).1  As relevant here, the \n21  regulations were substantively identical to the IFR, stating that HRSA was to provide “binding, \n22  comprehensive health plan coverage guidelines.”   \n23  C.  The 2011 HRSA Guidelines \n24  From November 2010 to May 2011, a committee convened by the Institute of Medicine \n25  (“IOM”) met in response to the charge of HHS’ Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and \n26  Evaluation: to “convene a diverse committee of experts” related to, as relevant here, women’s \n27 \n                                                 \n1 The Department of Treasury’s regulations were first promulgated in 2012, two years after those \n28 \nof the Health and Human Services and Labor departments. \n3 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 105   Filed 12/21/17   Page 4 of 29\n \n1  health issues.  IOM Report2 at 1, 23.  In July 2011, the committee issued a report recommending \n2  that private health insurance plans be required to cover all contraceptive methods approved by the \n3  Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), without cost sharing.  Id. at 102-10.   \n4  On August 1, 2011, HRSA issued its preventive care guidelines (“2011 Guidelines”), \n5  defining preventive care coverage to include all FDA-approved contraceptive methods.3   \n6  D.  The 2011 IFR and the Original Religious Exemption \n7  On August 3, 2011, the agencies issued an IFR amending the 2010 IFR.  See 76 Fed. Reg. \n8  46,621 (“the 2011 IFR”).  Based on the “considerable feedback” they received regarding \n9  contraceptive coverage for women, the agencies stated that it was “appropriate that HRSA, in \n10  issuing [its 2011] Guidelines, take[] into account the effect on the religious beliefs of certain \n11  religious employers if coverage of contraceptive services were required . . . .”  Id. at 46,623.  As \n12  such, the agencies provided HRSA with the “additional discretion to exempt certain religious \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  employers from the [2011] Guidelines where contraceptive services are concerned.”  Id.  They \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  defined a “religious employer” as one that:  \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  (1)  [h]as  the  inculcation  of  religious  values  as  its  purpose;  (2) \n sir\net primarily  employs  persons  who  share  its  religious  tenets;  (3) \ntatsiD 16  primarily serves persons who share its religious tenets; and (4) is a \nS d nr non-profit  organization  under  [the  relevant  statutory  provisions, \nee 17  which]  refer  to  churches,  their  integrated  auxiliaries,  and \nth\nintr conventions or associations of churches, as well as to the exclusively \nUo\nN 18  religious activities of any religious order. \n19  Id.   \n20    The 2011 IFR went into effect on August 1, 2011.  The agencies again found that they had \n21  both statutory authority and good cause to forgo the APA’s advance notice and comment \n22  requirement.  Id. at 46,624.  Specifically, they found that “providing for an additional opportunity \n23 \n                                                 \n24 \n2 Institute of Medicine, Clinical Preventive Services for Women: Closing the Gaps (2011), \navailable at https://www.nap.edu/read/13181/chapter/1. \n25 \n3 See HEALTH RES. & SERVS. ADMIN., Women’s Preventive Services Guidelines, available at \nhttps://www.hrsa.gov/womens-guidelines/index.html.  On December 20, 2016, HRSA updated the \n26 \nguidelines (“2016 Guidelines”), clarifying that “[c]ontraceptive care should include contraceptive \ncounseling, initiation of contraceptive use, and follow-up care,” as well as “enumerating the full \n27 \nrange of contraceptive methods for women” as identified by the FDA.  See HEALTH RES. & SERVS. \nADMIN., Women’s Preventive Services Guidelines, available at https://www.hrsa.gov/womens-\n28 \nguidelines-2016/index.html.  \n4 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 105   Filed 12/21/17   Page 5 of 29\n \n1  for public comment [was] unnecessary, as the [2010 IFR] . . . provided the public with an \n2  opportunity to comment on the implementation of the preventive services requirement in this \n3  provision, and the amendments made in [the 2011 IFR were] in fact based on such public \n4  comments.”  Id.  The agencies also found that notice and comment would be “impractical and \n5  contrary to the public interest,” because that process would result in a delay of implementation of \n6  the 2011 Guidelines.  See id.  The agencies further stated that they were issuing the rule as an IFR \n7  in order to provide the public with some opportunity to comment.  Id.  They requested comments \n8  by September 30, 2011. \n9    On February 15, 2012, after considering more than 200,000 responses, the agencies issued \n10  a final rule adopting the definition of “religious employer” set forth in the 2011 IFR.  77 Fed. Reg. \n11  8,725.  The final rule also established a temporary safe harbor, during which the agencies \n  12  plan[ned] to develop and propose changes to these final regulations \na\ntr in that  would  meet  two  goals—providing  contraceptive  coverage \nuoro 13  without cost-sharing to individuals who want it and accommodating \nCfi\n tla non-exempted,  non-profit  organizations’  religious  objections  to \nciC 14  covering contraceptive services . . . . \nrts fo\niD tc 15  Id. at 8,727. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  E.  The Religious Accommodation \nS d nr\nee 17  On March 21, 2012, the agencies issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  (“ANPR”) requesting comments on “alternative ways of providing contraceptive coverage without \n19  cost sharing in order to accommodate non-exempt, non-profit religious organizations with \n20  religious objections to such coverage.”  77 Fed. Reg. 16,503.  They specifically sought to “require \n21  issuers to offer group health insurance coverage without contraceptive coverage to such an \n22  organization (or its plan sponsor),” while also “provid[ing] contraceptive coverage directly to the \n23  participants and beneficiaries covered under the organization’s plan with no cost sharing.”  Id.  \n24  The agencies requested comment by June 19, 2012. \n25  On February 6, 2013, after reviewing more than 200,000 comments, the agencies issued \n26  proposed rules that (1) simplified the criteria for the religious employer exemption; and (2) \n27  established an accommodation for eligible organizations with religious objections to providing \n28  contraceptive coverage.  78 Fed. Reg. 8,458-59.  The proposed rule defined an “eligible \n5 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 105   Filed 12/21/17   Page 6 of 29\n \n1  organization” as one that (1) “opposes providing coverage for some or all of the contraceptive \n2  services required to be covered”; (2) “is organized and operates as a nonprofit entity”; (3) “holds \n3  itself out as a religious organization”; and (4) self-certifies that it satisfies these criteria.  Id. at \n4  8,462.  Comments on the proposed rule were due April 5, 2013. \n5  On July 2, 2013, after reviewing more than 400,000 comments, the agencies issued final \n6  rules simplifying the religious employer exemption and establishing the religious accommodation.  \n7  78 Fed. Reg. 39,870.4  With respect to the latter, the final rule retained the definition of “eligible \n8  organization” set forth in the proposed rule.  Id. at 39,874.  Under the accommodation, an eligible \n9  organization that met a “self-certification standard” was “not required to contract, arrange, pay, or \n10  refer for contraceptive coverage,” but its “plan participants and beneficiaries . . . [would] still \n11  benefit from separate payments for contraceptive services without cost sharing or other charge,” as \n12  required by law.  Id.  The final rules were effective August 1, 2013. \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  F.  The Hobby Lobby and Wheaton College Decisions \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14   On June 30, 2014, the Supreme Court issued its opinion in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Stores, Inc., in which three closely-held corporations challenged the requirement that they \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  “provide health-insurance coverage for methods of contraception that violate[d] the sincerely held \nS d nr\nee 17  religious beliefs of the companies’ owners.”  134 S. Ct. 2751, 2759 (2014).  The Court held that \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  this requirement violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (“RFRA”), 42 U.S.C. § \n19  2000bb et seq., because it was not the “least restrictive means” of serving the compelling interest \n20  in guaranteeing cost-free access to certain methods of contraception.  See Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. \n21  at 2781-82.5  The Court pointed to the religious accommodation as support for this point: “HHS \n22  itself has demonstrated that it has at its disposal an approach that is less restrictive than requiring \n23  employers to fund contraceptive methods that violate their religious beliefs. . . . HHS has already \n24 \n                                                 \n25 \n4 As to the definition of a religious employer, the final rule “eliminate[ed] the first three prongs \nand clarif[ied] the fourth prong of the definition” adopted in 2012.  78 Fed. Reg. 39,874.  Under \n26 \nthis new definition, “an employer that [was] organized and operate[d] as a nonprofit entity and \n[was] referred to in section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Code [was] considered a religious \n27 \nemployer for purposes of the religious employer exemption.”  Id. \n5 The Court assumed without deciding that such an interest was compelling within the meaning of \n28 \nRFRA.  Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2780. \n6 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 105   Filed 12/21/17   Page 7 of 29\n \n1  established an accommodation for nonprofit organizations with religious objections.”  Id. at 2782.  \n2  The Court stated that the Hobby Lobby ruling “[did] not decide whether an approach of this type \n3  complies with RFRA for purposes of all religious claims,” id., and said its opinion “should not be \n4  understood to hold that an insurance-coverage mandate must necessarily fall if it conflicts with an \n5  employer’s religious beliefs,” id. at 2783. \n6  Several days later, the Court issued its opinion in Wheaton College v. Burwell, 134 S. Ct. \n7  2806 (2014).  The plaintiff was a nonprofit college in Illinois that was eligible for the \n8  accommodation.  Id. at 2808 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting).  Wheaton College sought an injunction, \n9  however, “on the theory that its filing of a self-certification form [would] make it complicit in the \n10  provision of contraceptives by triggering the obligation for someone else to provide the services to \n11  which it objects.”  Id.  The Court granted the application for an injunction, ordering that it was \n12  sufficient for the college to “inform[] the Secretary of Health and Human Services in writing that \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  it is a nonprofit organization that holds itself out as religious and has religious objections to \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  providing coverage for contraceptive services . . . .”  Id. at 2807.  In other words, the college was \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  not required to “use the form prescribed by the [g]overnment,” nor did it need to “send copies to \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  health insurance issuers or third-party administrators.”  Id.  The Court stated the order “should not \nS d nr\nee 17  be construed as an expression of the Court’s views on the merits.”  Id. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  G.  Post-Hobby Lobby and -Wheaton Regulatory Action \n19  Shortly thereafter, on August 27, 2014, the agencies initiated two regulatory actions.  First, \n20  in light of Hobby Lobby, they issued proposed rules “amend[ing] the definition of an eligible \n21  organization [for purposes of the religious accommodation] to include a closely held for-profit \n22  entity that has a religious objection to providing coverage for some or all of the contraceptive \n23  services otherwise required to be covered.”  79 Fed. Reg. 51,121.  Comments were due on October \n24  21, 2014. \n25  Second, in light of Wheaton, the agencies issued IFRs (“the 2014 IFRs”) providing “an \n26  alternative process for the sponsor of a group health plan or an institution of higher education to \n27  provide notice of its religious objection to coverage of all or a subset of contraceptive services, as \n28  an alternative to the EBSA Form 700 [i.e., the standard] method of self-certification.”  Id. at \n7 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 105   Filed 12/21/17   Page 8 of 29\n \n1  51,095.  The agencies asserted they had both statutory authority and good cause to forgo the notice \n2  and comment period, stating that such a process would be “impracticable and contrary to the \n3  public interest,” particularly in light of Wheaton.  Id. at 51,095-96.  The IFRs were effective \n4  immediately, and comments were due October 27, 2014.   \n5  After considering more than 75,000 comments on the proposed rule, the agencies issued \n6  final rules “extend[ing] the accommodation to a for-profit entity that is not publicly traded, is \n7  majority-owned by a relatively small number of individuals, and objects to providing \n8  contraceptive coverage based on its owners’ religious beliefs”—i.e., to closely-held entities.  80 \n9  Fed. Reg. 41,324.  The agencies also issued a final rule “continu[ing] to allow eligible \n10  organizations to choose between using EBSA Form 700 or the alternative process consistent with \n11  the Wheaton interim order.”  Id. at 41,323. \n  12  H.  The Zubik Opinion and Subsequent Impasse \na\ntr in\nuoro 13    On May 16, 2016, the Supreme Court issued its opinion in Zubik v. Burwell, 136 S. Ct. \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  1557 (2016) (per curiam).  The petitioners, primarily non-profit organizations, were eligible for \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  the religious accommodation, but challenged the requirement that they submit notice to either their \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  insurer or the federal government as a violation of RFRA.  Zubik, 136 S. Ct. at 1558.  “Following \nS d nr\nee 17  oral argument, the Court requested supplemental briefing from the parties addressing ‘whether \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  contraceptive coverage could be provided to petitioners’ employees, through petitioners’ insurance \n19  companies, without any such notice from petitioners.’”  Id. at 1558-59.  After the parties stated \n20  that “such an option [was] feasible,” the Court remanded to afford them “an opportunity to arrive \n21  at an approach going forward that accommodates petitioners’ religious exercise while at the same \n22  time ensuring that women covered by petitioners’ health plans ‘receive full and equal health \n23  coverage, including contraceptive coverage.’”  Id. at 1559 (emphasis added).  As in Wheaton, \n24  “[t]he Court express[ed] no view on the merits of the cases,” and did not decide “whether \n25  petitioners’ religious exercise has been substantially burdened, whether the [g]overnment has a \n26  compelling interest, or whether the current regulations are the least restrictive means of serving \n27  that interest.”  Id. at 1560.  \n28    On July 22, 2016, the agencies issued a request for information (“RFI”) on whether, in \n8 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 105   Filed 12/21/17   Page 9 of 29\n \n1  light of Zubik,  \nthere  are  alternative  ways  (other  than  those  offered  in  current \n2  regulations)  for  eligible  organizations  that  object  to  providing \ncoverage for contraceptive services on religious grounds to obtain an \n3  accommodation,  while  still  ensuring  that  women  enrolled  in  the \norganizations’ health plans have access to seamless coverage of the \n4  full range of [FDA]-approved contraceptives without cost sharing. \n5  81 Fed. Reg. 47,741.  Comments were due September 20, 2016.  On January 9, 2017, the agencies \n6  issued a document titled “FAQs About Affordable Care Act Implementation Part 36” (“FAQs”).6  \n7  The FAQs stated that, based on the 54,000 comments received in response to the July 2016 RFI, \n8  there was “no feasible approach . . . at this time that would resolve the concerns of religious \n9  objectors, while still ensuring that the affected women receive full and equal health coverage, \n10  including contraceptive coverage.”  FAQs at 4. \n11  I.  The 2017 IFRs at Issue \n12  On May 4, 2017, the President issued Executive Order No. 13,798, directing the secretaries \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  of the departments of the Treasury, Labor, and HHS to “consider issuing amended regulations, \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  consistent with applicable law, to address conscience-based objections to the preventive care \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  mandate . . . .”  82 Fed. Reg. 21,675.   Subsequently, on October 6, 2017, the agencies issued the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Religious Exemption IFR and the Moral Exemption IFR at issue in this case (collectively, “the \nS d nr\nee 17  2017 IFRs”).  The 2017 IFRs departed from the prior regulations in several important ways. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  1.  The Religious Exemption IFR \n19  First, with the Religious Exemption IFR, the agencies substantially broadened the scope of \n20  the religious exemption, extending it “to encompass entities, and individuals, with sincerely held \n21  religious beliefs objecting to contraceptive or sterilization coverage,” and “making the \n22  accommodation process optional for eligible organizations.”  82 Fed. Reg. 47,807-08.  Such \n23  entities “will not be required to comply with a self-certification process.”  Id. at 47,808.  Just as \n24  the IFR expanded eligibility for the exemption, it “likewise” expanded eligibility for the optional \n25  accommodation.  Id. at 47,812-13. \n26 \n                                                 \n27 \n6 DEP’T OF LABOR, FAQs About Affordable Care Act Implementation Part 36, available at \nhttps://www.dol.gov/sites/default/files/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/faqs/aca-\n28 \npart-36.pdf. \n9 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 105   Filed 12/21/17   Page 10 of 29\n \n1  In introducing these changes, the agencies stated they “recently exercised [their] discretion \n2  to reevaluate these exemptions and accommodations,” and considered factors including: “the \n3  interests served by the existing Guidelines, regulations, and accommodation process”; the \n4  “extensive litigation”; the President’s executive order; the interest in protecting the free exercise of \n5  religion under the First Amendment and RFRA; the discretion afforded under the relevant \n6  statutory provisions; and “the regulatory process and comments submitted in various requests for \n7  public comments.”  Id. at 47,793.  The agencies advanced several arguments they claimed justified \n8  the lack of an advance notice and comment process for the Religious Exemption IFR, which \n9  became effective immediately. \n10  First, the agencies cited 26 U.S.C. § 9833, 29 U.S.C. § 1191c, and 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-92, \n11  asserting that those statutes authorized the agencies “to promulgate any interim final rules that \n12  they determine are appropriate to carry out” the relevant statutory provisions.  82 Fed. Reg. \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  47,813.  Second, the agencies asserted that even if the APA did apply, they had good cause to \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  forgo notice and comment because implementing that process “would be impracticable and \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  contrary to the public interest.”  Id.  Third, the agencies noted that “[i]n response to several of the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  previous rules on this issue—including three issued as [IFRs] under the statutory authority cited \nS d nr\nee 17  above—the Departments received more than 100,000 public comments on multiple occasions,” \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  which included “extensive discussion about whether and by what extent to expand the \n19  exemption.”  Id. at 47,814.7  For all of these reasons, the agencies asserted, “it would be \n20  impracticable and contrary to the public interest to engage in full notice and comment rulemaking \n21  before putting these interim final rules into effect . . . .”  Id. at 47,815.  Comments were due on \n22  December 5, 2017.   \n23  2.  The Moral Exemption IFR \n24  Also on October 6, 2017, the agencies issued the Moral Exemption IFR, “expand[ing] the \n25  exemption[] to include additional entities and persons that object based on sincerely held moral \n26  convictions.”  Id. at 47,849.  Additionally, “consistent with [their] expansion of the exemption, \n27 \n                                                 \n28 \n7 The Court will discuss Defendants’ proffered justifications in more detail below. \n10 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 105   Filed 12/21/17   Page 11 of 29\n \n1  [the agencies] expand[ed] eligibility for the accommodation to include organizations with \n2  sincerely held moral convictions concerning contraceptive coverage,” while also making the \n3  accommodation process optional for those entities.  Id.  The agencies included in the IFR a section \n4  called “Congress’ History of Providing Exemptions for Moral Convictions,” referencing statutes \n5  and legislative history, case law, executive orders, and state analogues.  See id. at 47,844-48.  The \n6  agencies justified the immediate issuance of the Moral Exemption IFR without an advance notice \n7  and comment process on grounds similar to those offered regarding the Religious Exemption IFR, \n8  stating that “[o]therwise, our regulations would simultaneously provide and deny relief to entities \n9  and individuals that are, in the [agencies’] view, similarly deserving of exemptions and \n10  accommodations consistent[] with similar protections in other federal laws.”  Id. at 47,855.  \n11  Comments were due on December 5, 2017. \n  12  J.  This District Court Action \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  On November 1, 2017, Plaintiffs filed the First Amended Complaint.  Dkt. No. 24 \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  (“FAC”).   They filed this motion for a preliminary injunction on November 9, 2017.  Dkt. No. 28 \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  (“Mot.”).  On November 29, 2017, Defendants filed an opposition, Dkt. No. 51 (“Opp.”), to which \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Plaintiffs replied on December 6, 2017, Dkt. No. 78 (“Reply”).  The Court held a hearing on the \nS de nre 17  motion on December 12, 2017.  Dkt. No. 100.8 \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  III.  LEGAL STANDARD \n19  A preliminary injunction is a matter of equitable discretion and is “an extraordinary \n20  remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.” \n21  Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008).  “A plaintiff seeking preliminary \n22  injunctive relief must establish that [it] is likely to succeed on the merits, that [it] is likely to suffer \n23  irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in [its] favor, \n24  and that an injunction is in the public interest.”  Id. at 20.  Alternatively, an injunction may issue \n25 \n                                                 \n26 \n8 The Court also granted several motions filed by groups seeking leave to file amicus curiae briefs.  \nSee Dkt. Nos. 72 (American Association of University Women, Service Employees International \n27 \nUnion, and 14 additional professional, labor, and student associations); 74 (14 states and the \nDistrict of Columbia); 76 (American Center for Law & Justice).  The Court has considered those \n28 \nbriefs along with the parties’ moving papers. \n11 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 105   Filed 12/21/17   Page 12 of 29\n \n1  where “the likelihood of success is such that serious questions going to the merits were raised and \n2  the balance of hardships tips sharply in [the plaintiff’s] favor,” provided that the plaintiff can also \n3  demonstrate the other two Winter factors.  Alliance for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d \n4  1127, 1131-32 (9th Cir. 2011) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  Under either \n5  standard, Plaintiffs bear the burden of making a clear showing that it is entitled to this \n6  extraordinary remedy.  Earth Island Inst. v. Carlton, 626 F.3d 462, 469 (9th Cir. 2010). \n7  IV.  ANALYSIS \n8  The Court first addresses the threshold issues of standing and venue, then turns to the \n9  preliminary injunction analysis.\n \n10  A.  Plaintiffs Have Standing to Sue. \n11  1.  Plaintiffs have Article III standing.  \n12  The standing doctrine is “rooted in the traditional understanding of a case or controversy,” \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  and “limits the category of litigants empowered to maintain a lawsuit in federal court to seek \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  redress for a legal wrong.”  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016).  In this way, the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  doctrine, “which is built on separation-of-powers principles, serves to prevent the judicial process \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  from being used to usurp the powers of the political branches.”  Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, \nS d nr\nee 17  568 U.S. 398, 408 (2013).  For this reason, the “standing inquiry has been especially rigorous \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  when reaching the merits of a dispute would force [a court] to decide whether an action taken by \n19  one of the other two branches of the [f]ederal [g]overnment was unconstitutional.”  Raines v. Byrd, \n20  521 U.S. 811, 819-20 (1997).   \n21  “States are not normal litigants for the purposes of invoking federal jurisdiction,” Mass. v. \n22  Envtl. Prot. Agency, 549 U.S. 497, 518 (2007), and are “entitled to special solicitude in [the] \n23  standing analysis,” id. at 520.  States have standing to protect their sovereign interests, such as the \n24  interest in their physical territory.  See Or. v. Legal Servs. Corp., 552 F.3d 965, 970 (9th Cir. \n25  2009) (quoting Mass., 549 U.S. at 518-19).  They may also sue to assert their quasi-sovereign \n26  interests, like “the health and well-being—both physical and economic—of [their] residents in \n27  general.”  Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. P.R. ex rel. Barez, 458 U.S. 592, 607 (1982).  In the latter \n28  situation, however, “the State must be more than a nominal party.”  Id. at 608.  “A quasi-sovereign \n12 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 105   Filed 12/21/17   Page 13 of 29\n \n1  interest must be sufficiently concrete to create an actual controversy between the State and the \n2  defendant.”  Id. at 602. \n3  State or not, a plaintiff invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing “the \n4  irreducible constitutional minimum” of standing.  Spokeo, 136 S. Ct. at 1547 (quoting Lujan v. \n5  Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992)).  That is, “the plaintiff must have suffered an \n6  injury in fact—an invasion of a legally protected interest” that is concrete, particularized, and \n7  actual or imminent, rather than conjectural or hypothetical.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 (internal \n8  quotation marks omitted).  The plaintiff’s injury must also be “fairly traceable to the challenged \n9  conduct of the defendant,” as well as “likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.”  \n10  Spokeo, 136 S. Ct. at 1547 (citing Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560-61).   \n11  Agency action that causes a state to “incur significant costs” is sufficient to constitute \n12  injury in fact.  See Tex. v. U.S., 809 F.3d 134, 155 (5th Cir. 2015) (finding that Texas had standing \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  to sue federal government because Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Permanent Residents  program required the state to issue driver’s licenses to program beneficiaries \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  “at a financial loss”).  Federal courts may also “recognize a ‘procedural injury’ when a procedural \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  requirement has not been met, so long as the plaintiff also asserts a ‘concrete interest’ that is \nS d nr\nee 17  threatened by the failure to comply with that requirement.”  City of Sausalito v. O’Neill, 386 F.3d \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  1186, 1197 (9th Cir. 2004).  Such a plaintiff “must show that the procedures in question are \n19  designed to protect some threatened concrete interest of his that is the ultimate basis of his \n20  standing.”  Citizens for a Better Forestry v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 341 F.3d 961, 969 (9th Cir. \n21  2003).  The plaintiff must also “establish the reasonable probability of the challenged action’s \n22  threat to [his or her] concrete interest.”  Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) \n23  (original brackets).  In such cases, once a plaintiff has established a procedural injury in fact, “the \n24  causation and redressability requirements are relaxed.”  Id. (citation and internal quotation marks \n25  omitted).   \n26  Plaintiffs have stated a procedural injury that is sufficient for the purposes of Article III \n27  standing.  They assert that Defendants failed to comply with the APA’s notice and comment \n28  requirement, resulting in Plaintiffs’ being “denied the opportunity to comment and be heard, prior \n13 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 105   Filed 12/21/17   Page 14 of 29\n \n1  to the effective date of the [2017] IFRs, concerning the impact of the rules on the States and their \n2  residents.”  FAC ¶ 16.  Plaintiffs must also show that these procedures “are designed to protect \n3  some concrete threatened interest” that “is the ultimate basis of [their] standing.”  See Citizens for \n4  a Better Forestry, 341 F.3d at 969.  Plaintiffs do so by explaining that they have an “interest in \n5  ensuring that women have access to no-cost contraceptive coverage” under the ACA, in large part \n6  because without that access, Plaintiffs will incur economic obligations, either to cover \n7  contraceptive services necessary to fill in the gaps left by the 2017 IFRs or for “expenses \n8  associated with unintended pregnancies.”  Reply at 3; see also Dkt. No. 28-8 (Decl. of Lawrence \n9  Finer) ¶ 61 (“Unintended pregnancies cost the state approximately $689 million . . . in 2010.”); \n10  Dkt. No. 28-14 (Decl. of Jenna Tosh) ¶ 27 (stating that California pays for 64 percent of \n11  unplanned births, with the average cost estimated at more than $15,000 per birth).  Accordingly, \n12  Plaintiffs are more than merely a “nominal party” in this suit asserting a quasi-sovereign interest in \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  the physical health and well-being of their citizens.  See Alfred L. Snapp & Son, 458 U.S. at 607-\nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  08.  Rather, they have shown that the 2017 IFRs will impact their fiscs in a manner that \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  corresponds with the IFRs’ impact on their citizens’ access to contraceptive care.  And, while the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  causation and redressability requirements are relaxed in cases of procedural injury, Plaintiffs also \nS d nr\nee 17  satisfy those prongs of the standing inquiry.  The injury asserted is directly traceable to \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Defendants’ decision to issue the IFRs without advance notice and comment, and granting a \n19  preliminary injunction would enjoin enforcement of those IFRs until the Court can assess the \n20  merits.9   \n21  Plaintiffs thus have standing under Article III. \n22  2.  Statutory Standing \n23  In addition to the requirements of Article III, “[a] plaintiff must also satisfy the non-\n24 \n                                                 \n25 \n9 While Defendants’ primary argument is that Plaintiffs lack standing, they fail to address, or even \nacknowledge, Plaintiffs’ asserted procedural injury under the APA in this context, focusing \n26 \ninstead on opposing Plaintiffs’ standing to bring any substantive claims.  See Opp. at 8-11.  \nDefendants thus fail to contend with the “relaxed” causation and redressability requirements.  See \n27 \nCitizens for a Better Forestry, 341 F.3d at 969.  They also inaccurately cast Plaintiffs’ allegations \nregarding their fiscal injury as “conclusory,” failing to address the substantial declarations \n28 \nsupporting Plaintiffs’ motion.  See Opp. at 9.   \n14 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 105   Filed 12/21/17   Page 15 of 29\n \n1  constitutional standing requirements of the statute under which [it] seeks to bring suit.”  City of \n2  Sausalito, 386 F.3d at 1199.  The APA provides that “[a] person . . . adversely affected or \n3  aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute is entitled to judicial review \n4  thereof.”  5 U.S.C. § 702.10  Courts have interpreted this provision to require a petitioner bringing \n5  suit under the APA to “establish (1) that there has been final agency action adversely affecting the \n6  plaintiff, and (2) that, as a result, it suffers legal wrong or that its injury falls within the zone of \n7  interests of the statutory provision the plaintiff claims was violated.”  Citizens for a Better \n8  Forestry, 341 F.3d at 976 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).   \n9  To qualify as “final agency action,” (1) “the action must mark the consummation of the \n10  agency’s decisionmaking process” and (2) “the action must be one by which rights or obligations \n11  have been determined, or from which legal consequences will flow . . . .”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 \n12  U.S. 154, 177-78 (2014) (citations and internal quotations marks omitted).  And the “zone of \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  interests” inquiry is “construed generously” and is “not meant to be especially demanding”: a \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  court should only deny standing on this ground where “the plaintiff’s interests are so marginally \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  assumed that Congress intended to permit the suit.”  City of Sausalito, 386 F.3d at 1200 (quoting \nS d nr\nee 17  Clarke v. Secs. Indus. Ass’n, 479 U.S. 388, 399 (1987)) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  The IFRs are final agency action.  Despite the presence of the word “interim” in “interim \n19  final rule,” “the key word . . . is not interim, but final,” because interim “refers only to the Rule’s \n20  intended duration—not its tentative nature.”  See Beverly Enters. v. Herman, 50 F. Supp. 2d. 7, 17 \n21  (D.D.C. 1999) (citing Career Coll. Ass’n v. Riley, 74 F.3d 1265, 1268 (D.C. Cir. 1996)).  The \n22  IFRs are thus properly understood as the consummation of the relevant agencies’ decisionmaking \n23  process.  And it is plain that “rights or obligations have been determined” by the IFRs.  For \n24  example, the Religious Exemption IFR extends the exemption to any entity with a “sincerely held \n25  religious belief[] objecting to contraceptive or sterilization coverage,” 82 Fed. Reg. 47,807-08, \n26 \n                                                 \n10 The Court is satisfied that Plaintiffs are persons under the APA.  See, e.g., Texas, 809 F.3d at \n27 \n162-63 (finding that Texas, the plaintiff, met the APA’s statutory standing requirements); Ariz. v. \nInter Tribal Council of Ariz., Inc., 133 S. Ct. 2247, 2259 (2013) (noting, in dicta, that a state may \n28 \nchallenge the decision of a federal commission under the APA).  \n15 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 105   Filed 12/21/17   Page 16 of 29\n \n1  while the Moral Exemption IFR broadens eligibility even more dramatically by making the \n2  exemption available to those “with sincerely held moral convictions by which they object to \n3  contraceptive or sterilization coverage,” id. at 47,849 (emphasis added).    \n4  Plaintiffs’ asserted injury is also squarely within the APA’s “zone of interests.”  Here, \n5  Plaintiffs allege a procedural injury because Defendants failed to comply with the APA’s notice \n6  and comment requirement, arguing they “have been denied the opportunity to comment and be \n7  heard, prior to the effective date of the IFRs, concerning the impact of the rules on the States and \n8  their residents.”  FAC ¶ 16.  The purpose of the APA’s notice and comment provision is \n \n9  (1) to  ensure  that  agency  regulations  are  tested  via  exposure  to \ndiverse public comment, (2) to ensure fairness to affected parties, \n10  and (3) to give affected parties an opportunity to develop evidence \nin the record to support their objections to the rule and thereby \n11  enhance the quality of judicial review.  \n12  Envtl. Integrity Project v. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 425 F.3d 992, 996 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (citation \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  omitted).  Plaintiffs’ right to be heard regarding the 2017 IFRs’ prospective impact on them and \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  their citizens is plainly within the ambit of the APA. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Plaintiffs accordingly have statutory standing under the APA. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  B.  Venue Is Proper in the Northern District of California. \nS d nr\nee 17  Defendants next assert that venue is improper here, reasoning that the venue statute \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  requires Plaintiffs to bring suit in their principal place of business, and claiming that “there is no \n19  plausible ‘principal place of business’ for the State of California other than Sacramento,” its \n20  capital, which is in the Eastern District of California.  Opp. at 12-13.  While there is scant \n21  authority on this issue, the Court finds venue in this district proper.  \n22  In a suit against the United States, its officers, or its agencies, a civil action “may, except \n23  as otherwise provided by law, be brought in any judicial district in which . . . the plaintiff resides if \n24  no real property is involved in the action.”  28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1).  There is no real property at \n25  stake in this action, so the venue inquiry turns on the question of Plaintiffs’ residence.  While this \n26  appears to be an issue of first impression in this district, common sense dictates that for venue \n27  purposes, a state plaintiff with multiple federal judicial districts resides in any of those districts.  \n28  The only other federal court that appears to have examined the question in any detail reached the \n16 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 105   Filed 12/21/17   Page 17 of 29\n \n1  same conclusion, finding that a state may bring suit under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1) “in any district \n2  within the state”: \nGiven the complete absence of authority presented directly on this \n3  point, this court is not willing to create the new rule proposed by the \nFederal Defendants that would, for no just or logical reason, limit a \n4  state containing more than one federal judicial district to suing the \nFederal Government only in the district containing the state capital, \n5  regardless of any other consideration relevant to the case or the \nparties’  convenience.  Indeed,  the  absence  of  authority  may  be \n6  precisely  because  common  sense  dictates  that  a  state  resides \nthroughout its sovereign borders and the idea has not previously \n7  been challenged. \n8  Ala. v. U.S. Army Corp of Eng’rs, 382 F. Supp. 2d 1301, 1329 (N.D. Ala. 2005).11  The Court \n9  finds this reasoning persuasive, and declines to adopt Defendants’ rule that would limit the State \n10  of California to bringing suit in the Eastern District of California.  Venue is therefore proper in \n11  this district. \n  12  C.  Plaintiffs Have Shown They Are Entitled to a Preliminary Injunction. \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Plaintiffs are entitled to a preliminary injunction because (1) they have shown that, at a \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  minimum, they are likely to succeed on their claim that Defendants violated the APA by issuing \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  the 2017 IFRs without advance notice and comment; (2) they have shown that they are likely to \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  suffer irreparable harm as a result of this procedural violation; and (3) the balance of equities tips \nS d nr\nee 17  in Plaintiffs’ favor, and the public interest favors granting the injunction.  \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  1.   Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in showing that Defendants violated the \nAPA in issuing the 2017 IFRs without advance notice and comment. \n19 \n20  The most important Winter factor is likelihood of success on the merits.  See Disney \n21  Enters., Inc. v. VidAngel, Inc., 869 F.3d 848, 856 (9th Cir. 2017).   \n22  a.  With few exceptions, the APA requires agencies to publish \nnotice of proposed rules and consider public comment before \n23  final promulgation. \n24  Plaintiffs contend that “Defendants evaded their obligations under the APA by \n25  promulgating rules without proper notice and comment.”  Mot. at 15.  The Court agrees.  Under \n26 \n                                                 \n11 Defendants, in contrast, cite a 27-year-old unpublished case from the Eastern District of \n27 \nPennsylvania which involved a different section of the venue statute and addressed the residence \nof state agencies and state officials, not the states themselves.  See Opp. at 13 (citing Bentley v. \n28 \nEllam, No. 89-5418, 1990 WL 63734, at *1 (E.D. Pa. May 8, 1990)). \n17 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 105   Filed 12/21/17   Page 18 of 29\n \n1  the APA, an agency promulgating a rule normally must first publish a “[g]eneral notice of \n2  proposed rule making” in the Federal Register, including: “(1) a statement of the time, place, and \n3  nature of public rule making proceedings; (2) reference to the legal authority under which the rule \n4  is proposed; and (3) either the terms or substance of the proposed rule or a description of the \n5  subjects and issues involved.”  5 U.S.C. § 553(b).  After such notice has issued, “the agency shall \n6  give interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rule making through submission of \n7  written data, views, or arguments with or without opportunity for oral presentation.”  Id. § 553(c).  \n8  The agency must then consider any “relevant matter presented . . . .”  Id.   As relevant here, these \n9  notice and comment requirements do not apply “when the agency for good cause finds . . . that \n10  notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public \n11  interest.”  Id. § 553(b)(3)(B).12  \n12  The APA’s notice and comment requirement reflects Congress’ “judgment that notions of \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  fairness and informed administrative decisionmaking require that agency decisions be made only \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  after affording interested persons notice and an opportunity to comment.”  Paulsen v. Daniels, 413 \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  F.3d 999, 1004-05 (9th Cir. 2005) (quoting Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 316 (1979)).  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  “It is antithetical to the structure and purpose of the APA for an agency to implement a rule first, \nS d nr\nee 17  and then seek comment later.”  Id. at 1005.  Accordingly, an agency “must overcome a high bar if \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  it seeks to invoke the good cause exception to bypass the notice and comment requirement,” given \n19  that the exception “is essentially an emergency procedure.”  U.S. v. Valverde, 628 F.3d 1159, \n20  1164-65 (9th Cir. 2010) (citations, internal quotations marks, and brackets omitted).  In other \n21  words, “a failure to comply with the APA’s notice and comment procedures may be excused only \n22  in those narrow circumstances in which delay would do real harm.”  Id. (citation and internal \n23  quotation marks omitted); see also Indep. Guard Ass’n of Nev., Local No. 1. v. O’Leary ex rel. \n24  U.S. Dep’t of Energy, 57 F.3d 766, 769 (9th Cir. 1995) (emphasizing that good-cause exceptions \n25  to section 553 are to be “narrowly construed and only reluctantly countenanced”) (citation \n26  omitted).  The inquiry as to whether an agency has demonstrated good cause “proceeds case-by-\n27 \n                                                 \n12 Defendants do not argue that notice and comment was “unnecessary” for either the Religious \n28 \nExemption IFR, see 82 Fed. Reg. 47,813, or the Moral Exemption IFR, see id. at 47,855. \n18 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 105   Filed 12/21/17   Page 19 of 29\n \n1  case, sensitive to the totality of the factors at play.”  Valverde, 628 F.3d at 1164 (citations and \n2  internal quotation marks omitted).  \n3  On October 6, 2017, Defendants promulgated the Religious Exemption IFR and Moral \n4  Exemption IFR, effective immediately.  Although both IFRs solicited public comment until \n5  December 5, 2017, their immediate promulgation violated the APA’s notice and comment \n6  requirement because Defendants failed to publish the required advance notice of proposed \n7  rulemaking.  Nor did they provide the public with an advance opportunity to comment, making it \n8  impossible for the agency to consider the input of any interested parties before enactment.  Thus, \n9  the issuance of the 2017 IFRs was unlawful unless either (a) the APA does not apply or (b) the \n10  Defendants can show that an exception to its requirements applies.\n \n11  b.  Defendants had no statutory authority to forgo the APA’s notice \nand comment requirement as to the 2017 IFRs. \n12 \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Defendants first argue that they had “express statutory authorization” to promulgate the \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  IFRs, thus exempting them from the APA’s advance notice and comment requirement.  See Opp. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  at 15.  Specifically, Defendants cite the authority conferred upon them by 26 U.S.C. § 9833, 29 \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  U.S.C. § 1191c, and 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-92.  See id.  Each of those provisions, in turn, contains this \nS d nr\nee 17  nearly identical phrase: “[t]he Secretary may promulgate any interim final rules as the Secretary \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  determines are appropriate to” carry out its statutory duties in this realm.  Defendants interpret this \n19  as a signal that Congress intended to free them from the APA’s requirements.  But “[t]he APA \n20  provides that no subsequent statute shall be deemed to modify it ‘except to the extent that it does \n21  so expressly.’”  Castillo-Villagra v. Immigration & Naturalization Serv., 972 F.2d 1017, 1025 (9th \n22  Cir. 1992) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 559); see also Lake Carriers Ass’n v. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 652 F.3d \n23  1, 6 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (per curiam) (citing section 559 for the same principle).  The D.C. Circuit \n24  has framed the question as “whether Congress has established procedures so clearly different from \n25  those required by the APA that it must have intended to displace the norm.”  Asiana Airlines v. \n26  Fed. Aviation Admin., 134 F.3d 393, 397 (D.C. Cir. 1998).   \n27  Here, the statutory authority cited by Defendants does not support their argument that \n28  Congress intended to displace the APA’s notice and comment requirements.  Castilla-Villagra \n19 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 105   Filed 12/21/17   Page 20 of 29\n \n1  involved the question of whether the APA or the Immigration and Naturalization Act (“INA”) \n2  governed the court’s analysis of an administrative notice.  972 F.2d at 1025.  In deciding that the \n3  INA governed, the court cited the INA’s exclusivity provision, as well as the Supreme Court’s \n4  interpretation of that provision.  Id. at 1026.  In contrast, the authority cited by Defendants \n5  contains no such exclusivity provision.  And in Lake Carriers, the court considered whether the \n6  Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) violated the APA when it issued a permit without \n7  providing an opportunity for notice and comment regarding certain state certification conditions.  \n8  652 F.3d at 5-6.  In support of its position, the EPA cited a provision of the Clean Water Act \n9  (“CWA”) that required certifying states to “establish procedures for public notice . . . and, to the \n10  extent it deems appropriate, procedures for public hearings . . . .”  Id. at 6 (quoting 33 U.S.C. § \n11  1341(a)).  While the court ultimately found on another ground that the EPA was not required to \n12  engage in notice and comment, id. at 10, the court “doubt[ed] that [the CWA provision’s] \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  requirement that states provide for notice and comment regarding proposed conditions \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  constitute[d] the requisite ‘plain express[ion]’ of congressional intent to supersede the APA’s \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  requirements,” id. at 6.  This Court likewise finds that the statutory authority cited by \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Defendants—which is much more broadly worded than the CWA provision in Lake Carriers—is \nS d nr\nee 17  not so clearly different from the APA’s procedures so as to reflect an intent to displace them.  \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Finally, in Asiana Airlines, the court found that a statute directing the Federal Aviation \n19  Administration to “publish in the Federal Register an initial fee schedule and associated collection \n20  process as interim final rule, pursuant to which public comment will be sought and a final rule \n21  issued” supplanted the APA’s requirements.  134 F.3d at 396-98.  In this case, the authority cited \n22  by Defendants makes no mention of any analogous procedure (or any procedure at all).    \n23  Defendants’ arguments to the contrary are unavailing.  No case cited by the parties or \n24  identified by the Court has held that the statutory provisions cited by the Defendants supplant the \n25  APA’s procedural requirements.  Defendants quote Real Alternatives, Inc. v. Burwell, 150 F. \n26  Supp. 3d 419, 427 n.6 (M.D. Pa. 2015), for the proposition that the “APA . . . did not apply to the \n27  2011 IFR under this specific statutory authority.”  See Opp. at 15.  But that reading is not \n28  supported by the case, which simply quoted the agencies’ argument in the 2011 IFR that they had \n20 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 105   Filed 12/21/17   Page 21 of 29\n \n1  statutory authority to forgo notice and comment for that IFR.  See Real Alternatives, 150 F. Supp. \n2  3d at 427 n.6 (quoting 76 Fed. Reg. 46,624).  Defendants also cite Coalition for Parity, Inc. v. \n3  Sebelius, 709 F. Supp. 2d 10 (D.D.C. 2010), in support of their argument that the asserted \n4  statutory authority contemplates procedures that are “clearly different” from the APA’s \n5  requirements.  See Opp. at 15.  But that case only undermines their argument, because there, the \n6  court considered the same statutory grants of IFR-promulgating authority cited by Defendants in \n7  this case (i.e., 26 U.S.C. § 9833, 29 U.S.C. § 1191c, and 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-92), and found that \n8  they were not sufficiently different from the APA to displace the latter’s requirements.  See \n9  Coalition for Parity, 709 F. Supp. 2d at 17-19. \n10  Defendants accordingly had no statutory authority to forgo notice and comment before \n11  issuing the 2017 IFRs. \n  12  c.  The “totality of factors” establishes that Defendants had no good \na\ntr in cause to forgo advance notice and comment for the 2017 IFRs. \nuoro 13 \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  The Court also finds that the “totality of factors” compels the conclusion that Defendants \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  had no good cause to forgo notice and comment.  Defendants argue that engaging in notice and \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  comment before issuing the 2017 IFRs would have been “impracticable and contrary to the public \nS d nr\nee 17  interest.”  See 82 Fed. Reg. 47,813; id. at 47,855.  “Notice and comment is ‘impracticable’ when \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  the agency cannot ‘both follow section 553 and execute its statutory duties.’”  Riverbend Farms, \n19  Inc. v. Madigan, 958 F.2d 1479, 1484 n.2 (9th Cir. 1992) (quoting Levesque v. Block, 723 F.2d \n20  175, 184 (1st Cir. 1983)).  And it is “contrary to the public interest” when “public rule-making \n21  procedures . . . prevent an agency from operating.”  Id. (citation and internal quotation marks \n22  omitted); see also Levesque, 723 F.2d at 185 (“Congress’s view seems to have been that any time \n23  one can expect real interest from the public in the content of the proposed regulation, notice-and-\n24  comment rulemaking will not be contrary to the public interest.”). \n25  Defendants fail to show that their decision to forgo advance notice and comment was \n26  justified by good cause under section 553.  In the Religious Exemption IFR, they set forth several \n27  purported justifications: (1) the “[d]ozens” of pending lawsuits challenging the contraceptive \n28  mandate; (2) the desire to cure violations of RFRA, based on the contention that “requiring certain \n21 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 105   Filed 12/21/17   Page 22 of 29\n \n1  objecting entities or individuals to choose between the Mandate, accommodation, or penalties for \n2  [noncompliance]” constitutes such a violation; (3) the desire to bring HRSA guidelines into \n3  “accord with the legal realities” of the temporary injunctions issued in various cases; (4) the desire \n4  “to provide immediate resolution” to parties with religious objections to the mandate; (5) the \n5  desire to avoid increases in the costs of health insurance caused by entities remaining on more \n6  expensive grandfathered plans—which are exempt from the mandate—to avoid becoming subject \n7  to the mandate; and (6) the desire to avoid delay in making the accommodation available to a \n8  broader category of entities.  82 Fed. Reg. 47,813-15.  In the Moral Exemption IFR, Defendants \n9  set forth similar justifications.  Id. at 47,855-56. \n10  None of these proffered reasons justified the use of the “emergency procedure” that is the \n11  good-cause exception.  See Valverde, 628 F.3d at 1164-65.  Defendants make no argument that the \n12  above considerations made it impossible for them to both satisfy the notice and comment \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  requirement and execute their statutory duties under the ACA.  Defendants also fail to establish (or \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  even claim) that notice and comment would have effectively prevented them from operating.  \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Instead, they argue that “any additional delay in issuing the Rules would be contrary to the public \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  interest,” because “[p]rompt effectiveness would provide entities and individuals facing burdens \nS d nr\nee 17  on their sincerely held religious beliefs and moral convictions with important and urgent relief.”  \nth\nintr\nUoN 18  Opp. at 16.13  But “[i]f ‘good cause’ could be satisfied by an Agency’s assertion that ‘normal \n19  procedures were not followed because of the need to provide immediate guidance and information \n20  . . . then an exception to the notice requirement would be created that would swallow the rule.”  \n21  See Valverde, 628 F.3d at 1166 (quoting Zhang v. Slattery, 55 F.3d 732, 746 (2d Cir. 1995)).14   \n22 \n                                                 \n13 Indeed, as to the public interest justification, Defendants estimated at oral argument that they \n23 \nhave received hundreds of thousands of comments regarding the 2017 IFRs.  This weakens the \nsuggestion that engaging in advance notice and comment would have been contrary to the public \n24 \ninterest, given the public’s evident “real interest” in this matter.  See Levesque, 723 F.2d at 185. \n14 Defendants cite Priests for Life v. U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, 772 F.3d 229 \n25 \n(D.C. Cir. 2014), vacated, Zubik, 136 S. Ct. at 1561, as a decision finding good cause to forgo \nadvance notice and comment in circumstances similar to these.  See Opp. at 16-17.  But Priests for \n26 \nLife is distinguishable. There, the court rejected the religious objector plaintiffs’ argument that the \ngovernment lacked the requisite good cause to promulgate the 2014 IFRs without advance notice \n27 \nand comment, noting that the 2014 IFRs modified regulations that “were recently enacted pursuant \nto notice and comment rulemaking, and presented virtually identical issues . . . .”  Priests for Life, \n28 \n772 F.3d at 276 (emphasis added); see also id. (describing the modifications in the 2014 IFRs as \n22 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 105   Filed 12/21/17   Page 23 of 29\n \n1  Defendants also argue that they “demonstrated a willingness to consider public comment, \n2  both prior and following issuance of the rules.”  Opp. at 16.  But Defendants’ willingness to \n3  consider comments “on the exemption and accommodation issues” generally, see id. at 17, does \n4  not excuse their failure to do so before enacting the 2017 IFRs.  This is particularly true because \n5  the 2017 IFRs represent a direct repudiation of Defendants’ prior well-documented and well-\n6  substantiated public positions.  Moreover, these IFRs are much broader in scope, and introduce an \n7  entirely new moral conviction basis for objecting to the contraceptive mandate.  Until October 6, \n8  2017, the public had no notice of Defendants’ intent to dramatically broaden eligibility for the \n9  exemption and to make the accommodation optional.  The fact that the public may have previously \n10  commented on these broad topics in the context of past iterations of the rules does not change that. \n11  In addition, whether or not Defendants are willing to consider post-promulgation \n12  comments, it remains “antithetical to the structure and purpose of the APA for an agency to \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  implement a rule first, and then seek comment later.”  Paulsen, 413 F.3d at 1005; see also \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Valverde, 628 F.3d at 1166 (noting that “[t]he Attorney General’s request for post-promulgation \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  comments in issuing the interim rule casts further doubt upon the authenticity and efficacy of the” \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  asserted basis for good cause under section 553).  The same reasoning defeats Defendants’ \nS d nr\nee 17  argument that “the Rules are effective only until final rules are issued.”  See Opp. at 17.  And that \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  argument is further undercut by the fact that on November 30, 2017 the Centers for Medicare & \n19  Medicaid Services, which are part of HHS, issued guidance for the implementation of the 2017 \n20  IFRs.15  The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that the issuance of this guidance, before the end of the \n21  post-promulgation comment period, suggests that “it does not appear that the Defendants expect \n22  public comment to inform implementation.”  Reply at 10. \n23  In short, Defendants had no good cause to forgo the APA’s notice and comment \n24 \n                                                                                                                                                             \n“minor” and “meant only to augment current regulations in light of” the Supreme Court’s decision \n25 \nin Wheaton) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  The 2017 IFRs, in contrast, represent \na dramatic about-face in federal policy, and adopt sweeping changes with regard to the exemption \n26 \nand accommodation. \n15 See CTRS.

See Valverde, 628 F.3d at 1164-65.   \n3  d.  Defendants’ failure to provide an advance notice and comment \nprocess for the 2017 IFRs was not harmless error. \n4 \n5  Defendants argue that, in any event, “any error in forgoing notice and comment was \n6  harmless,” citing the APA’s instruction to take “due account” of “the rule of prejudicial error.”  \n7  Opp. at 18 (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 706).  The Court, however, exercises “great caution in applying the \n8  harmless error rule in the administrative rulemaking context,” lest it “gut[] the APA’s procedural \n9  requirements.”  Paulsen, 413 F.3d at 1006 (quoting Riverbend Farms, 958 F.2d at 1487).  “[T]he \n10  failure to provide notice and comment is harmless only where the agency’s mistake ‘clearly had \n11  no bearing on the procedure used or the substance of decision reached.’”  Id. (quoting Riverbend \n12  Farms, 958 F.2d at 1487).  In Paulsen, the court found that the Bureau of Prisons’ “violation of \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  the APA was not merely technical,” because “the Bureau failed to provide the required notice-and-\nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  comment period before effectuating [an] interim regulation, thereby precluding public \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  participation in the rulemaking.”  Id.  Defendants’ actions here are analogous: they precluded \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  public participation in the promulgation of the 2017 IFRs before those rules became effective.  As \nS d nr\nee 17  such, there is no way to conclude that Defendants’ violation “clearly had no bearing on the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  procedure used or the substance of decision reached,” meaning that the error was not harmless. \n19  Defendant argues that “the Rules were issued after the Agencies received ‘more than \n20  100,000 public comments’ throughout six years of publishing and modifying these regulations.”  \n21  Opp. at 18.  But as discussed above, that does not render harmless this procedural error, regarding \n22  these IFRs.  Nor does it take into account the substantial differences between the previous \n23  iterations of these rules and the IFRs at issue.16  Far from being harmless, Defendants’ error \n24  prevented Plaintiffs from vindicating the purpose of the APA’s notice and comment requirement.  \n25 \n                                                 \n26 \n16 See 75 Fed. Reg. 41,730 (2010 IFR was necessary to allow health plans sufficient time to \ncomply with the requirements of the newly-enacted ACA within an approximately two-month \n27 \ntimeframe); 76 Fed. Reg. 46,624 (2011 IFR was based on public comments received in response \nto the 2010 IFR, before HRSA’s 2011 Guidelines were in effect); 79 Fed.

Plaintiffs are likely to suffer irreparable harm unless the Court enjoins \nthe 2017 IFRs. \n4 \n5  A procedural injury may serve as a basis for a finding of irreparable harm when a \n6  preliminary injunction is sought.  See N. Mariana Islands v. U.S., 686 F. Supp. 2d 7, 17 (D.D.C. \n7  2009) (finding, in preliminary injunction analysis, that “[a] party experiences actionable harm \n8  when ‘depriv[ed] of a procedural protection to which he is entitled’ under the APA”) (quoting \n9  Sugar Cane Growers Coop. of Fla. v.

A court’s analysis focuses on whether harm \nS d nr\nee 17  is irreparable, “irrespective of the magnitude of the injury.”  Simula, Inc. v. Autoliv, Inc., 175 F.3d \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  716, 725 (9th Cir. 1999).   \n19  Plaintiffs are not only likely to suffer irreparable procedural harm in the absence of a \n20  preliminary injunction, they already have done so.  Because the 2017 IFRs were effective \n21  immediately, Plaintiffs’ harm is ongoing.  Every day the IFRs stand is another day Defendants \n22  may enforce regulations likely promulgated in violation of the APA’s notice and comment \n23  provision, without Plaintiffs’ advance input.  And Plaintiffs’ right to provide such input does not \n24  exist in a vacuum.  Rather, it is in large part defined by what is at stake: the health of Plaintiffs’ \n25  citizens and Plaintiffs’ fiscal interests.  Under the 2017 IFRs, more employers than ever before are \n26  eligible for the exemption and the accommodation, the latter of which is now entirely optional for \n27  organizations asserting a religious or moral objection.  Put another way, for a substantial number \n28  of women, the 2017 IFRs transform contraceptive coverage from a legal entitlement to an \n25 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 105   Filed 12/21/17   Page 26 of 29\n \n1  essentially gratuitous benefit wholly subject to their employer’s discretion.  See generally Dkt. No. \n2  72 at 6-14 (amicus brief for American Association of University Women et al., describing “wide \n3  and potentially boundless range” of employers who “will be able to claim religious or moral \n4  exemptions” under the 2017 IFRs).  The impact on the rules governing the health insurance \n5  coverage of Plaintiffs’ citizens—and the stability of that coverage—was immediate, which also \n6  implicates Plaintiffs’ fiscal interests as described above.  If the Court ultimately finds in favor of \n7  Plaintiffs on the merits, any harm caused in the interim by rescinded contraceptive coverage would \n8  not be susceptible to remedy.  Thus, Plaintiffs have satisfied the irreparable harm prong of the \n9  inquiry.   \n10  3.  The balance of the equities tips in Plaintiffs’ favor, and a public interest \nfavors granting preliminary injunctive relief. \n11 \n12  Plaintiffs also prevail on the balance of equities and public interest analyses.  When the \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  government is a party to a case in which a preliminary injunction is sought, the balance of the \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  equities and public interest factors merge.  Drakes Bay Oyster Co. v. Jewell, 747 F.3d 1073, 1092 \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  (9th Cir. 2014).  Broadly speaking, there are two interests at stake in that balance: “the interest in \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  ensuring coverage for contraceptive and sterilization services” as provided for under the ACA, and \nS d nr\nee 17  the interest in “provid[ing] conscience protections for individuals and entities with sincerely held \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  religious beliefs [or moral convictions] in certain health care contexts.”  82 Fed. Reg. 47,793; see \n19  also id. at 47,839.  Here, but for the APA violation the Court has found likely to be shown, \n20  Plaintiffs could have participated in Defendants’ rulemaking process, “explain[ed] the practical \n21  effects of [the] rule before [it was] implemented,” and helped “ensure[] that the agency proceed in \n22  a fully informed manner, exploring alternative, less harmful approaches” to expanding eligibility \n23  for the exemption and making the accommodation optional.  See Mot. at 18-19.  That does not \n24  mean the outcome necessarily would have been different, but section 553 is concerned with the \n25  important value served by proper process.  See Citizens for a Better Forestry, 341 F.3d at 976 \n26  (stating that petitioners alleging procedural injury under an environmental statute were required to \n27  show only that adherence to statutory procedures could influence an agency’s decision, and not \n28  that such adherence “would result in a different conclusion”) (citation omitted).  \n26 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 105   Filed 12/21/17   Page 27 of 29\n \n1    With those interests in mind, the Court concludes that the balance of equities tips in \n2  Plaintiffs’ favor.  Plaintiffs face potentially dire public health and fiscal consequences as a result \n3  of a process as to which they had no input.  On the other hand, returning to the state of affairs \n4  before the enactment of the 2017 IFRs—in which eligible entities still would be permitted to avail \n5  themselves of the exemption or the accommodation—does not constitute an equivalent harm to the \n6  Defendants pending resolution of the merits.  While Defendants’ interest in “protecting religious \n7  liberty and conscience” is unquestionably legitimate, see Opp. at 35, the Court believes it likely \n8  that the prior framing of the religious exemption and accommodation permissibly ensured such \n9  protection.  That is to say, the Court views as likely correct the reasoning of the eight Circuit \n10  Courts of Appeals (of the nine to have considered the issue) which found that the procedure in \n11  place prior to the 2017 IFRs did not impose a substantial burden on religious exercise under \n12  RFRA.17  The balance of equities thus tips in Plaintiffs’ favor.   \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13    For similar reasons, the public interest favors the granting of a preliminary injunction.  The \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Court notes that “[t]he public interest is served when administrative agencies comply with their \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  obligations under the APA.”  N. Mariana Islands, 686 F.

Because the standard set forth in Winter \n5  is met, the Court grants Plaintiffs’ motion.18  \n6  D.  This Preliminary Injunction Effectively Reinstates the Regime in Place Before \nthe Issuance of the 2017 IFRs. \n7 \n8  The Court next turns to the contours of Plaintiffs’ remedy.  “The scope of an injunction is \n9  within the broad discretion of the district court . . . .”  TrafficSchool.com, Inc. v. Edriver Inc., 653 \n10  F.3d 820, 829 (9th Cir. 2011).  “Ordinarily when a regulation is not promulgated in compliance \n11  with the APA, the regulation is invalid.”  Paulsen, 413 F.3d at 1008.  “The effect of invalidating \n12  an agency rule is to reinstate the rule previously in force.”  Id.    \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Under the circumstances, the Court finds it appropriate to issue a nationwide preliminary \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  injunction.  Defendants did not violate the APA just as to Plaintiffs: no member of the public was \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  permitted to participate in the rulemaking process via advance notice and comment.  Accordingly, \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Defendants are (1) preliminarily enjoined from enforcing the 2017 IFRs, and (2) required to \nS d nr\nee 17  continue under the regime in place before October 6, 2017, pending a determination on the merits.  \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  This is consistent with the general practice of invalidating rules not promulgated in compliance \n19  with the APA and reinstating the “rule previously in force,” and maintains the status quo that \n20  existed before the implementation of the likely invalid 2017 IFRs.    \n21  The Court notes that simply enjoining Defendants from enforcing the 2017 IFRs, without \n22  requiring them to proceed under the prior regime pending resolution of the merits, would result in \n23  a problematic regulatory vacuum, in which the rights of both women seeking cost-free \n24  contraceptive coverage and employers seeking religious exemption or accommodation would be \n25  uncertain.  See Opp. at 35 n.25.  At oral argument, counsel for Defendants confirmed that they do \n26 \n                                                 \n27 \n18 Because the Court finds that entry of a preliminary injunction is warranted on the basis \ndiscussed above, it need not at this time consider the additional bases for injunctive relief \n28 \nadvanced by Plaintiffs. \n28 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 105   Filed 12/21/17   Page 29 of 29\n \n1  not advocate for such a vacuum in the event the Court grants a preliminary injunction.  This \n2  nationwide injunction does not conflict with the plaintiff-specific injunctions issued by the courts \n3  in the Zubik cases or any other case.  Returning to the state of affairs before October 6, 2017 \n4  means just that: the exemption and accommodation as they existed following the Zubik remand \n5  remain in effect, as do any court orders enjoining Defendants from enforcing those rules against \n6  specific plaintiffs. \n7  V.  CONCLUSION \n8  For the reasons set forth above, Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction is \n9  GRANTED, effective as of the date of this order.

Ensuring coverage of and access to preventive care, including all 18 Food and Drug \n3 \nAdministration (FDA) approved methods of contraception, is a key element in safeguarding \n4 \nwomen’s overall health and well-being, plays a key role in women’s socioeconomic advancement, \n5 \nand benefits society as a whole.  It is therefore a critical component of the plaintiff States’ public \n6 \nhealth and welfare interests.  Contraceptives are among the most widely used medical services in \n7 \nthe United States and are much less costly than maternal deliveries for women, insurers, \n8 \nemployers, and states.  Consequently, the use of contraceptives has been shown to result in net \n9 \nsavings to women and to states.  Starting in 2012, as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable \n10 \nCare Act (ACA), certain group health insurance plans were required to cover all FDA-approved \n11 \ncontraceptive methods and contraceptive counseling (collectively known as “contraceptive \n12 \nservices”) without cost-sharing (e.g. individual out of pocket health expenses on copays, \n13 \ndeductibles, or coinsurance) for beneficiaries.  45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(1)(iv); 29 C.F.R. § \n14 \n2590.715-2713(a)(1)(iv); 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713(a)(1)(iv).  Since this contraceptive-coverage \n15 \nrequirement took effect in 2012, women across the country have saved $1.4 billion per year. \n16 \n2.  On October 6, 2017, without notice or comment, the U.S. Health and Human Services \n17 \n(HHS), in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Labor and U.S. Department of the Treasury \n18 \n(Departments), issued two illegal interim final rules (IFRs), 2017-21851 and 2017-21852, which \n19 \nwere effective immediately.  The IFRs drastically changed access to contraceptive coverage by \n20 \nexpanding the scope of the prior religious exemption to, among other things, allow any employer \n21 \nor health insurer with religious objections to opt out of the contraceptive-coverage requirement.  \n22 \nAdditionally, the IFRs expanded the exemption to include employers with “moral” objections to \n23 \nproviding contraceptive coverage.  While the prior regulations provided an automatic seamless \n24 \nmechanism for women to continue to receive contraceptive coverage under an “accommodation \n25 \nprocess”—a process that divorced the objecting employer from funding or providing the \n26 \ncontraceptive coverage benefits; the IFRs eviscerated that protection, rendering the automatic \n27 \nseamless mechanism entirely optional.  This prior accommodation process did not require \n28 \n  5   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 6 of 68\n \n1  employees to do anything; rather, it was handled by the government communicating with the \n2  health plan.  Further, under the new regime and in contrast to the prior rules, an employer need \n3  not notify the federal government of its decision to stop providing contraceptive coverage.  Nor is \n4  there any independent requirement, under the IFRs, that the objecting employer notify their \n5  employees that they are exempting themselves from the contraceptive-coverage requirement.  As \n6  a result of these new IFRs, women across the nation were susceptible to losing contraceptives and \n7  contraceptive counseling, leaving the States to shoulder the additional fiscal and administrative \n8  burdens. \n9  3.  On December 21, 2017, this Court enjoined implementation of the IFRs.  This Court \n10  held that the States, at a minimum, were likely to succeed on their claim that Defendants violated \n11  the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by issuing the IFRs without advance notice and \n12  comment, and that absent a preliminary injunction, the States would suffer irreparable substantive \n13  and procedural injuries, in addition to the equities and public interest tipping in the States’ favor.  \n14  This Court rejected defendants’ venue and standing arguments, the latter because the States had \n15  demonstrated they would incur economic burdens, either to cover contraceptive services \n16  necessary to fill in the gaps left by the IFRs or for expenses associated with unintended \n17  pregnancies.  \n18  4.  The Ninth Circuit largely upheld this Court’s decision.  California v. Azar, --F.3d -- , \n19  2018 WL 6566752 (9th Cir. Dec. 13, 2018).  The Ninth Circuit concluded that venue was proper \n20  in the Northern District because a state is “ubiquitous throughout its borders” and “[t]he text of \n21  the venue statute therefore dictates that a state with multiple judicial districts ‘resides’ in every \n22  district within its borders.”  Id. at *4.  The Ninth Circuit also held that the States have standing to \n23  sue.  Id. at *5.  The Court held that the states showed that the IFRs would “first lead to women \n24  losing employer-sponsored contraceptive coverage, which [would] then result in economic harm \n25  to the states.”  Id.  The Court elaborated that “it is reasonably probable that women in the plaintiff \n26  states will lose some or all employer-sponsored contraceptive coverage due to the IFRs.”  Id. at 6.  \n27  The Court highlighted that the Defendants’ “own regulatory impact analysis (RIA)—which \n28  explains the anticipated costs, benefits, and effects of the IFRs—estimates that between 31,700 \n  6   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 7 of 68\n \n1  and 120,000 women nationwide will lose some coverage.”  Id.  (“Evidence supports that, with \n2  reasonable probability, some women residing in the plaintiff states will lose coverage due to the \n3  IFRs”).   The Court also concluded that “loss of coverage [would] inflict economic harm to the \n4  states.”  Id. at *7.  The Court noted that the RIA estimates that the direct cost of filling the \n5  coverage loss as $18.5 or $63.8 million per year and the rule identifies state and local programs as \n6  filling that gap; thus, the RIA “assumed that state and local governments will bear additional \n7  economic costs.”  Id.  The Court concluded that the “declarations submitted by the states further \n8  show that women losing coverage from their employers will turn to state-based program or \n9  programs reimbursed by the state.”  Id.  \n10  5.  On the merits, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the States were likely to succeed on \n11  their APA notice-and-comment claim.  California v. Azar, --F.3d -- , 2018 WL 6566752, at *9-13 \n12  (9th Cir. Dec. 13, 2018).  The Court concluded that the Defendants had neither good cause nor \n13  statutory authority to bypass notice and comment.  Id.  As to irreparable harm, the Court also \n14  concluded that the harm to the States was “not speculative; it is sufficiently concrete and \n15  supported by the record.”  Id. at *14.  \n16  6.  On November 7, 2018, the Departments issued their final rules which were published \n17  on November 15, 2018 (the Contraception Exemption Rules), 2018-24512 and 2018-24514.  The \n18  Contraception Exemption Rules, like the IFRs, expand the scope of the religious exemption to \n19  allow virtually any employer or health insurer with religious or moral objections to opt out of the \n20  contraceptive-coverage requirement.  The Contraception Exemption Rules render the \n21  accommodation process—the automatic seamless mechanism for women to continue to receive \n22  contraceptive coverage if their employer opts out—entirely voluntary.  Under the Rules, there is \n23  no requirement that the employer notify the federal government of its decision that it will stop \n24  providing contraceptive coverage.  Without such notice from the employer, there will be no way \n25  to know the number of employers opting out of their statutory obligation to provide \n26  contraceptives.  Further, there will be no way for the federal government to evaluate the \n27  legitimacy of an employer’s use of the exemption.  Such a process opens the door to rampant \n28  abuse.  Women across the nation will be left without contraceptive coverage—healthcare \n  7   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 8 of 68\n \n1  coverage they are entitled to under the law—leaving the States to shoulder the additional fiscal \n2  and administrative burdens as women seek access for this coverage through state-funded \n3  programs, as the Rules are encouraging.  The rules will also lead to public health consequences \n4  due to women’s being unable to gain seamless access to critical and time-sensitive care.   \n5  7.  The federal government suggests that should an employer exempt themselves from \n6  providing contraceptive coverage, women should “simply” seek out this crucial healthcare at Title \n7  X clinics; however, this suggestion has several flaws.  First, such a suggestion ignores the ACA’s \n8  requirement that women today have seamless contraceptive coverage through their employer-\n9  sponsored healthcare plan.  Requiring a woman to seek out a family planning healthcare provider, \n10  separate and apart from her employer-sponsored healthcare plan and provider, eviscerates the \n11  “seamlessness” mandated by the contraceptive-coverage requirement.  Second, publicly-funded \n12  family planning providers are intended for low-income families, are operating at high capacity \n13  levels, and are underfunded.  These clinics require federal and state funding to keep their doors \n14  open and have already experienced major slashes to their budgets, with more expected as the \n15  White House proposed cutting the budget by 50%.  Further, the federal government itself, while \n16  urging women to “simply” utilize these programs, is drastically changing these programs which \n17  will result in a less sophisticated provider network, decreased access to all 18 FDA-approved \n18  methods, and other consequences.  As a result, not only can these clinics not afford to serve an \n19  entirely new patient population, their ability to provide all 18 FDA-approved methods of \n20  contraceptive is diminished.  The Contraception Exemption Rules will become effective on \n21  January 14, 2019.  \n22  8.  The State of California, the State of Connecticut, the State of Delaware, the District \n23  of Columbia, the State of Hawaii, the State of Illinois, the State of Maryland, the State of \n24  Minnesota, by and through its Department of Human Services, the State of New York, the State \n25  of North Carolina, the State of Rhode Island, the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of \n26  Vermont, and the State of Washington (collectively, “the States”), challenge the illegal IFRs and \n27  Contraception Exemption Rules and seek an injunction to prevent the IFRs and the Contraception \n28  Exemption Rules from taking effect because the regulations violate the APA, the Establishment \n  8   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 9 of 68\n \n1  Clause of the First Amendment, and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  \n2  Furthermore, the IFRs and the Contraception Exemption Rules will cause immediate and \n3  irreparable harm to the States unless enjoined.     \n4  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5  9.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (action arising under the \n6  laws of the United States), 28 U.S.C. § 1361 (action to compel officer or agency to perform duty \n7  owed to Plaintiff), and 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706 (Administrative Procedure Act).  An actual \n8  controversy exists between the parties within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a), and this Court \n9  may grant declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and other relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-\n10  2202 and 5 U.S.C. §§ 705-706. \n11  10.  Defendants’ issuance of the IFRs on October 6, 2017 and publication of the \n12  Exemption Rules on November 15, 2018, constitutes final agency action that is judicially \n13  reviewable within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act.  5 U.S.C. §§ 704, 706. \n14    11.  Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1) because a state \n15  plaintiff with multiple federal judicial districts resides in any of those districts and this action seeks \n16  relief against federal agencies and officials acting in their official capacities.  \n17  INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT  \n18    12.   Pursuant to Civil Local Rules 3-5(b) and 3-2(c), there is no basis for assignment of \n19  this action to any particular location or division of this Court. \n20  PARTIES \n21  13.

Washington is a sovereign state in the United States of America.  \n3  The Attorney General is Washington State’s chief law enforcement officer and is authorized to \n4  advance the State’s interest in protecting women’s access to critical healthcare services.   \n5  27.  The States have an interest in ensuring women’s healthcare is available, accessible, \n6  and affordable, especially women’s reproductive healthcare.  Healthcare is one of the police \n7  powers of the States.  The States rely on Defendants’ compliance with the procedural and \n8  substantive requirements of the APA to obtain timely and accurate information about federal \n9  actions that may have significant adverse impacts on access to healthcare, including contraceptive \n10  coverage, and to meaningfully participate in an impartial and public decision-making process \n11  before those federal changes take effect. \n12  28.  Each State is aggrieved by the actions of Defendants and has standing to bring this \n13  action because of the injury to its state sovereignty caused first by Defendants’ issuance of the \n14  illegal IFRs and now by the Contraception Exemption Rules, including immediate and irreparable \n15  injuries to its sovereign, quasi-sovereign, and proprietary interests.1  The States will suffer \n16  concrete and substantial harm because the Exemption Rules frustrate the States’ public health \n17  interests by curtailing women’s access to contraceptive care through employer-sponsored health \n18  insurance.2  Additionally, the federal regulation inhibits state agencies from carrying out their \n19  statutorily required functions, including state antidiscrimination laws.   \n20 \n21 \n                                                           \n1 Plaintiff District of Columbia is uniquely situated among the Plaintiff States, as it has no \n22  sovereign interest to claim as against the Federal Government.  See Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 17; N. \nPipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U.S. 50, 76 (1982); District of Columbia ex \n23  rel. Am. Combustion, Inc. v. Transamerica Ins. Co., 797 F.2d 1041, 1046 (D.C. Cir. 1986).  \nRather, the District asserts its quasi-sovereign interests and its authority to enforce its laws and \n24  uphold the public interest under its Attorney General Act, which was intended to incorporate the \ncommon law authority of states’ attorneys general.  D.C. Code. § 1-301.81.  See also Alfred L. \n25  Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico ex rel. Barez, 458 U.S. 592, 608 n.15 (1982) (recognizing that \nPuerto Rico “has a claim to represent its quasi-sovereign interests in federal court at least as \n26  strong as that of any State”). \n2 Though this complaint focuses on how the Exemption Rules target women, the \n27  Exemption Rules also may affect people who do not identify as women, including some gender \nnon-conforming people and some transgender men.  \n28 \n  12   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 13 of 68\n \n1  29.  Further, the States are aggrieved by the actions of Defendants and have standing to \n2  bring this action because of the injuries that will be caused to the States by the enforcement of \n3  Defendants’ Exemption Rules limiting women’s ability to obtain contraception.  The States will \n4  suffer concrete and substantial harm because they will incur increased costs of providing \n5  contraceptive coverage to many of the women who stand to lose coverage through the Exemption \n6  Rules, as well as increased costs associated with resulting unintended pregnancies and the related \n7  attendant harms.  The Defendants have already conceded that the States have standing because \n8  the Rules instruct women to seek out healthcare from state-funded clinics.  82 Fed. Reg. at 47792, \n9  47807 (Oct. 13, 2017) (instructing that women obtain contraceptives through “various \n10  governmental programs,” including “State sources”); 82 Fed. Reg. at 47803 (noting that various \n11  “State programs” provide contraceptive coverage).  In fact, the Ninth Circuit also concluded that \n12  the States have standing.  California v. Azar, --F.3d -- , 2018 WL 6566752, at *5-8 (9th Cir. Dec. \n13  13, 2018) (states have demonstrated that women in plaintiff states will lose some or all employer-\n14  sponsored contraceptive coverage and that the loss of coverage will inflict economic harm to the \n15  states). \n16  30.  The States are also aggrieved by Defendants’ failure to comply with the notice and \n17  comment procedures required by the APA.  The States have been denied the opportunity to \n18  participate in a full, fair, and impartial administrative process.  The Defendants undertook an \n19  improper notice and comment process by issuing immediately effective illegal IFRs, then \n20  accepting comments on those Rules, then issuing the Exemption Rules.  \n21  31.  Defendant Alex M. Azar, II, is Secretary of HHS and is sued in his official capacity.  \n22  Secretary Azar has responsibility for implementing and fulfilling HHS’s duties under the \n23  Constitution, the ACA, and the APA. \n24  32.  Defendant HHS is an agency of the United States government and bears \n25  responsibility, in whole or in part, for the acts complained of in this Complaint.  The Centers for \n26  Medicare and Medicaid Services is an agency within the HHS. \n27 \n28 \n  13   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 14 of 68\n \n1  33.

Secretary Mnuchin has responsibility for implementing and \n9  fulfilling the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s duties under the Constitution, the ACA, and the \n10  APA. \n11  36.  Defendant U.S. Department of the Treasury is an agency of the United States \n12  government and bears responsibility, in whole or in part, for the acts complained of in this \n13  Complaint.  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is an entity within the U.S. Department of the \n14  Treasury.  \n15  STATUTORY BACKGROUND  \n16  I.    THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT \n17    37.  The ACA requires that employers provide no-cost contraceptive coverage to their \n18  employees.  Specifically, the ACA provides that certain group health insurance plans cover \n19  preventive care and screenings without imposing costs on the employee and his/her covered \n20  dependents.  42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a).  Importantly, this includes women’s “preventive care and \n21  screenings . . . as provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources \n22  and Services Administration.”  42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4).  During the 2009 health reform \n23  debates leading up to the ACA’s passage, the United States Congress specifically proposed an \n24  amendment to require health plans to cover comprehensive women’s preventive care and \n25  screenings.  This amendment, which came to be called the Women’s Health Amendment, relied \n26  on guidelines developed by the independent, nonpartisan Institute of Medicine (IOM) and later \n27  adopted by HHS.  It required coverage for “preventive care and screenings” for women with no \n28 \n  14   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 15 of 68\n \n1  out of pocket costs to the woman, ensuring essential protections for women’s access to preventive \n2  healthcare not currently covered in other prevention sections of the ACA.   \n3    38.  The Women’s Health Amendment sought to redress the “fundamental inequity” that \n4  women were systematically charged more for preventive services than men.  155 Cong. Rec. \n5  S12027 (Dec. 1, 2009) (statement of Sen. Gillibrand).3  At the time, “more than half of women \n6  delay[ed] or avoid[ed] preventive care because of its cost.”  Id.  Supporters of the amendment \n7  expected that eradicating these discriminatory barriers to preventive care—including \n8  contraceptive care—would result in substantially improved health outcomes for women.  See, \n9  e.g., id. at S12052 (statement of Sen. Franken); id. at. S12059 (statement of Sen. Cardin) (noting \n10  that amendment will cover “family planning services”); id. (statement of Sen. Feinstein) (same).   \n11    39.  While the Women’s Health Amendment was ultimately adopted, Congress rejected a \n12  competing amendment that would have permitted broad moral and religious exemptions to the \n13  ACA’s coverage requirements—the same moral and religious exemptions that are reflected in the \n14  IFRs and the Final Exemption rules.  Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2775 n.30; id. at 2789-2790 \n15  (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).   \n16    40.  After the passage of the Women’s Health Amendment, the IOM assembled a diverse, \n17  nonpartisan committee of health experts to draft a report to determine what should be included in \n18  cost-free “preventive care” coverage for women.  The report underwent rigorous, independent \n19  external review prior to its release.  \n20    41.  On or about July 19, 2011, the IOM issued its expert report which included a \n21  comprehensive set of eight evidence-based recommendations for strengthening preventive \n22  healthcare services.  Specifically, the IOM recommended that private health insurance plans be \n23  required to cover all contraceptive benefits and services approved by the FDA without cost-\n24  sharing (also known as out-of-pocket costs such as deductibles and copays).  \n25 \n26 \n                                                           \n3 See id. at S12051 (statement of Sen. Franken) (similar); id. at S12027 (statement of Sen. \n27  Gillibrand) (“women of child-bearing age spend 68 percent more in out-of-pocket heath care \ncosts than men”); id. at S12051 (statement of Sen. Dodd) (similar). \n28 \n  15   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 16 of 68\n \n1    42.  These IOM recommendations, developed after an exhaustive review of the medical \n2  and scientific evidence, were intended to fill important gaps in coverage for women.  The \n3  recommendations include coverage for an annual well-woman preventive care visit, specific \n4  services for pregnant women and nursing mothers, counseling and screening for HIV and \n5  domestic violence, as well as services for the early detection of reproductive cancers and sexually \n6  transmitted infections.   \n7    43.  Significantly, the recommendations include coverage of the full range of all FDA-\n8  approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling \n9  for all women with reproductive capacity.  The IOM acknowledged the reality that cost can be a \n10  daunting barrier for women when it comes to choosing and using the most effective contraceptive \n11  method.  For instance, certain highly effective contraceptive methods, such as the intrauterine \n12  device (IUD) and the implant, have high up-front costs, which act as a barrier to access despite \n13  the fact that these contraceptives are long-acting and 99% effective.  The IOM considers these \n14  services essential so that “women can better avoid unwanted pregnancies and space their \n15  pregnancies to promote optimal birth outcomes.”4  \n16    44.  The IOM also recommended that “preventive care” include not only contraceptive \n17  coverage such as access to all FDA-approved contraceptive methods but also counseling and \n18  education to ensure that women received information on the best method for their individual set \n19  of circumstances.5  \n20    45.  Following the IOM’s recommendations relating to contraceptive coverage, HHS, the \n21  U.S. Department of Labor, and the U.S. Department of the Treasury promulgated regulations \n22  requiring that group health insurance plans cover all FDA-approved contraceptive methods \n23  without cost to women and their covered dependents.  45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(1)(iv); 29 C.F.R.   \n24  § 2590.715-2713(a)(1)(iv); 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713(a)(1)(iv). \n25 \n26 \n                                                           \n4 Institute of Medicine, Clinical Preventive Services for Women: Closing the Gaps (2011), \n27  available at https://www.nap.edu/read/13181/chapter/7#104. \n5 Id., available at https://www.nap.edu/read/13181/chapter/7?term=education#107. \n28 \n  16   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 17 of 68\n \n1    46.  In implementing this statutory scheme, HHS made clear that these coverage \n2  requirements were not applicable to group health plans sponsored by religious employers.  \n3  Further, HHS made available a religious accommodation to certain employers who seek to not \n4  provide this coverage.  Through this religious accommodation, the federal government ensured \n5  that women had access to seamless contraceptive coverage as entitled under the ACA, while also \n6  providing employers with a mechanism to opt out of providing or paying for this coverage.   \n7    47.  In order to effectuate this policy, HHS’s Health Resources and Services \n8  Administration (HRSA) issued guidelines implementing the IOM’s expert report’s \n9  recommendations.  These guidelines guaranteed that women received a comprehensive set of \n10  preventive services without having to pay a co-payment, co-insurance, or a deductible. \n11    48.  HRSA’s comprehensive guidelines included a list of each type of preventive service, \n12  and the frequency with which that service should be offered.  Under the guidelines, HHS \n13  recognized that well-woman visits should be conducted annually for adult women to obtain the \n14  recommended preventive services that are age- and development-appropriate, including pre-\n15  conception care and many services necessary for prenatal care.  Although HRSA recognized that \n16  the well-woman health screening should occur at least on an annual basis, HRSA also noted that \n17  several visits may be needed to obtain all necessary recommended preventive services, depending \n18  on a woman’s health status, health needs, and other risk factors.  HRSA’s guidelines also \n19  included annual counseling on sexually transmitted infections for all sexually active women, \n20  annual counseling and screening for human immunodeficiency virus infection for all sexually \n21  active women, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for all women with \n22  reproductive capacity.  These guidelines ensured that women could access a comprehensive set of \n23  preventive services any cost barrier.   \n24    49.  Significantly, HRSA’s comprehensive guidelines, like the IOM recommendations, \n25  required that all 18 FDA-approved contraceptive methods be included as “preventive services.”  \n26  Those methods include, for example, sterilization, IUDs, implantable rods, shots/injections, oral \n27  contraceptives, the patch, vaginal contraceptive rings, diaphragms, cervical caps, and condoms.  \n28 \n  17   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 18 of 68\n \n1    50.  In March 2016, HRSA awarded a five-year cooperative agreement to the American \n2  College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) to update the women’s preventive services \n3  guidelines originally recommended by the IOM and work to develop additional recommendations \n4  to enhance women’s overall health.  In that same month, ACOG launched the “Women’s \n5  Preventive Services Initiative” (WPSI), which was a multidisciplinary steering committee headed \n6  by ACOG to update the IOM recommendations from 2011.  Through this initiative, ACOG \n7  partnered with the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American College of \n8  Physicians, and the National Association of Nurse Practitioners in Women’s Health to achieve \n9  this goal.  The WPSI issued draft recommendations for public comments in September of 2016 \n10  and the updated “Women’s Preventive Service Guidelines” were finalized and implemented by \n11  HRSA on December 20, 2016 to take effect December 20, 2017.   \n12    51.  Importantly, these expert, evidence-based medical recommendations, issued in 2016, \n13  continued to endorse coverage of all 18 FDA-approved contraceptive methods and counseling for \n14  women with reproductive capacity, thereby underscoring their importance to women.  \n15    52.  The ACA forbids the Secretary of HHS from promulgating regulations that “create[] \n16  any unreasonable barriers” to medical care or “impede[] timely access to health care services.”  \n17  42 U.S.C. § 18114(1), (2).   \n18    53.  The ACA also contains an antidiscrimination provision.  This provision prohibits an \n19  individual from being “excluded from participation in,” “denied the benefits of,” or “subjected to \n20  discrimination under, any health program or activity.”  42 U.S.C. § 18116(a).   \n21  II.    THE TITLE X FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAM \n22    54.  In a message to Congress in July 1969, President Richard Nixon wrote that “no \n23  American woman should be denied access to family planning assistance because of her economic \n24  condition.  I believe, therefore, that we should establish as a national goal the provision of \n25  adequate family planning services within the next five years to all those who want them but \n26  cannot afford them.”6  Following the directive of President Nixon, in 1970, Congress enacted \n                                                           \n27  6 Adrienne Stith Butler & Ellen Wright Clayton, eds., Institute of Medicine, A REVIEW OF \nTHE HHS FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAM:  MISSION, MANAGEMENT, AND MEASUREMENT RESULTS, \n28  (continued…) \n  18   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 19 of 68\n \n1  Title X to make comprehensive, voluntary family planning services available to “all persons \n2  desiring such services.”  See Pub.

Id.  \n6    55.   The Title X family planning program, which serves four million women and men \n7  across the country, is the only national family planning program that serves low-income women \n8  and families and otherwise underserved communities.

CONTRACEPTIVE COVERAGE \n10  58.  Contraceptives are among the most widely used medical products in the United \n11  States, with 99% of sexually active women having used at least one type of contraception in their \n12  lifetimes.  By the age of 40, American women have used an average of three or four different \n13  methods (some of which are available only by prescription), after considering their relative \n14  effectiveness, side effects, drug interactions and hormones, the frequency of sexual conduct, \n15  perceived risk of sexually transmitted infections, the desire for control, cost, and a host of other \n16  factors.  Of course, women face the possibility of having children for many years of their life and \n17  therefore if a woman wants only two children, for instance, she would need to spend roughly \n18  three decades on birth control to avoid unintended pregnancies.  Due to the positive impact of \n19  contraception for women and society, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \n20  concluded that family planning, including access to modern contraception, was one of the ten \n21  greatest achievements of the 20th century.  Further, one-third of the wage gains women have \n22  made since the 1960s are the result of access to oral contraceptives.  Access to birth control has \n23  helped narrow the wage gap between women and men.  The decrease in the wage gap among 25 \n24  to 49-year-olds between men’s and women’s annual incomes would have been 10% smaller in the \n25  1980s and 30% smaller in the 1990s in the absence of widespread legal birth control access for \n26  women.  \n27  59.  Unintended pregnancy has negative health, fiscal, and societal impacts across the \n28  United States.  In 2001, an estimated 49% of all pregnancies in the United States were \n  20   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 21 of 68\n \n1  unintended, and 42% of those unintended pregnancies ended in abortion.  More recent studies \n2  estimate that the national rate of unintended pregnancies is 45 per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44.  \n3  Unintended pregnancies are associated with increases in maternal and child morbidity, including \n4  increased odds of preterm birth, low birth weight, and the potentially life-long negative health \n5  effects of premature birth.  Significantly, the risk of unintended pregnancy is greatest for the most \n6  vulnerable women: young, low-income, minority women without a high school or college \n7  education.    \n8  60.  There is considerable evidence that the use of contraception has resulted in lower \n9  unintended pregnancy and abortion rates in the United States.  The Guttmacher Institute has \n10  found that the two-thirds of women who are at risk for unintended pregnancy and use \n11  contraception consistently account for only 5% of unintended pregnancies.  Another study \n12  showed that, from the early 1990s to early 2000s, increased rates of contraceptive use by \n13  adolescents were associated with a marked decline in teen pregnancies, with contraception use \n14  accounting for 86% of the decline.  \n15  61.  Increased access to contraceptives has resulted in the rate of abortions being at an all-\n16  time low.  A recent report from the CDC shows that the national abortion rate declined 26% \n17  between 2006 and 2015, hitting the lowest level that the government has on record.  The CDC \n18  credits access to healthcare services and specifically access to contraception as a significant factor \n19  influencing the decrease. \n20  62.  Without insurance coverage to defray or eliminate the cost, the large-up front costs of \n21  the more effective contraceptive methods—such as an IUD, which is more than 99% effective but \n22  costs between $500-$800—would drive women to less expensive and less effective contraceptive \n23  methods.  One study showed that among women who lacked health insurance, 44% agreed that \n24  having insurance would help them to afford and use birth control and 44% agreed that it would \n25  allow them to choose a better method; 48% also agreed that it would be easier to use \n26  contraception consistently if they had coverage.  Among insured women who still had a \n27  copayment using a prescription method (i.e. those in grandfathered plans), 40% agreed that if the \n28  copayment were eliminated, they would be better able to afford and use birth control, 32% agreed \n  21   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 22 of 68\n \n1  this would help them choose a better method, and 30% agreed this would help them to use their \n2  methods of contraception more consistently.   \n3  63.  With the decrease in unintended pregnancies and abortions, there is a corresponding \n4  decrease in the risk of maternal mortality, adverse child outcomes, behavior problems in children, \n5  and negative psychological outcomes associated with unintended pregnancies for both mothers \n6  and children.  Significantly, access to contraceptive coverage helps women to delay childbearing \n7  and pursue additional education, spend additional time in their careers, and have increased \n8  earning power over the long-term.  Contraceptive use also allows for spacing between \n9  pregnancies, which is important because there is an increased risk of adverse health outcomes for \n10  pregnancies that are too closely spaced, and is especially critical for the health of women with \n11  certain medical conditions.  There are additional benefits of contraceptive use for treating medical \n12  conditions, including menstrual disorders and pelvic pain, and long-term use of oral \n13  contraceptives has been shown to reduce women’s risk of endometrial cancer, pelvic \n14  inflammatory disease, and some breast diseases. \n15  64.  Contraceptive use achieves significant cost savings as well.  In 2002, the direct \n16  medical cost of unintended pregnancy in the United States was nearly $5 billion, with the cost \n17  savings due to contraceptive use estimated to be $19.3 billion.  Nationwide, in 2010, the \n18  government expended an estimated $21 billion to cover the medical costs for unplanned births, \n19  miscarriages and abortions.   \n20  65.  Contraceptives are much less costly than maternal deliveries for states, insurers, \n21  employers, and patients, and consequently, they have been shown to result in net savings to \n22  women.  The ACA’s requirement to cover contraception benefits and services without cost \n23  sharing has saved American women $1.4 billion since the law took effect in 2012.  For instance, \n24  the share of women of reproductive age who had out-of-pocket spending on oral contraceptive \n25  pills fell sharply after the ACA; plummeting from 20.9% in 2012 to 3.6% in 2014, corresponding \n26  to the timing of the ACA provision.  To date, 62.4 million women nationwide have benefited \n27  from this coverage, including 7.4 million in California, 756,856 in Connecticut, over 175,000 in \n28  Delaware, 152,600 in the District of Columbia, over 260,000 in Hawaii, over 2.5 million in \n  22   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 23 of 68\n \n1  Illinois, nearly 1.3 million in Maryland, over 1.1 million in Minnesota, 3.8 million in New York, \n2  almost 2 million in North Carolina, over 210,000 in Rhode Island, 181,585 in Vermont, more \n3  than 1.6 million in Virginia, and 1.4 million in Washington.7  Although both men and women \n4  benefit from access to safe and reliable contraceptive care, women disproportionately bear the \n5  cost of obtaining contraceptives.  This is in part because only two of the FDA-approved methods \n6  of contraceptives—male sterilization surgery and male condoms—are available for use by men.  \n7  The methods of contraception at issue in this matter are only available for women. \n8  66.  The U.S. Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) \n9  estimated that, in 2011-13, approximately 6,324,503 women in California, 746,444 women in \n10  Connecticut, 171,575 women in Delaware, 127,531 women in the District of Columbia, 256,448 \n11  women in Hawaii, 2,380,326 women in Illinois, 1,225,095 women in Maryland, 1,075,362 \n12  women in Minnesota, 3,582,133 women in New York, 1,631,312 women in North Carolina, \n13  201,595 women in Rhode Island, 122,892 women in Vermont, 1,587,663 women in Virginia, and \n14  1,258,201 women in Washington, ages 15-64, had preventive services coverage with zero cost \n15  sharing.8 \n16  67.  These cost savings to women have a corresponding fiscal impact on public health, \n17  and thus on the States, as well.  The ACA’s contraceptive-coverage requirement decreases the \n18  number of unintended pregnancies, and thereby reduces the costs associated with those \n19  pregnancies or termination of those pregnancies.  Furthermore, unintended pregnancy is \n20  associated with poor birth outcomes and maternal health issues, and thus, the contraceptive-\n21  coverage requirement also reduces the number of high-cost births and infants born in poor health. \n22 \n23 \n24 \n                                                           \n25  7 See attached exhibit A, demonstrating the impact in every State, also available at  \nhttps://nwlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/New-Preventive-Services-Estimates-3.pdf. \n26  8 See attached exhibit B, reflecting the impacts in every State, also available at  \nhttps://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/pdf/139221/The%20Affordable%20Care%20Act%20is%20Impr\n27  oving%20Access%20to%20Preventive%20Services%20for%20Millions%20of%20Americans.pd\nf \n28 \n  23   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 24 of 68\n \n1  CALIFORNIA \n2  68.  In California, 48% of all pregnancies were unintended in 2010.  Of those unplanned \n3  pregnancies that resulted in births, 64.3% were publicly funded, costing California $689.3 million \n4  on unintended pregnancies. \n5  69.  In 2014, the California Legislature passed the Contraceptive Equity Act of 2014 (SB \n6  1053), which requires certain health plans to cover certain prescribed FDA-approved \n7  contraceptives for women without cost-sharing.  Twenty-nine other states have a range of \n8  contraceptive equity laws, some aimed at making contraception cheaper and more accessible.9  \n9  However, several states do not have contraceptive equity laws (e.g. plaintiff Virginia), do not \n10  require that health plans cover all FDA-approved contraceptives, and/or do not require that such \n11  contraceptives be provided without cost-sharing.   \n12  70.  In passing the Contraceptive Equity Act, the California Legislature concluded that \n13  providing contraception will result in overall savings in the healthcare industry due to reduced \n14  office visits, reduced unintended pregnancies, and therefore, reduced prenatal care, abortions, and \n15  labor and delivery costs.  In fact, the California Health Benefits Review Program (CHBRP) \n16  anticipated that there would be substantial cost savings, including $213 million in savings to \n17  private employers, $86 million in savings to individuals, and $7 million in savings to CalPERS, \n18  California’s pension and healthcare system for public employees.  CHBRP also anticipated a cost \n19  savings of $56 million for Medi-Cal managed care.  In addition to these fiscal benefits, there is \n20  huge benefit to California’s public health.  CHBRP estimated that access to and increased \n21  contraceptive use under this Act would result in 51,298 averted unintended pregnancies and \n22  20,006 fewer abortions. \n23  71.  California’s Contraceptive Equity Act, however, only applies to state-regulated health \n24  plans.  It does not apply to self-funded health plans, through which 61% of covered workers are \n25  insured.  Self-funded health plans are governed by the Federal Employee Retirement Income \n                                                           \n26  9 Those states include:  Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, \nDistrict of Columbia, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, \n27  Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, \nNorth Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.  \n28 \n  24   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 25 of 68\n \n1  Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and are regulated by the U.S. Department of Labor, Employee \n2  Benefits Security Administration.  Notably, when California’s Contraceptive Equity Law was \n3  passed, the ACA’s contraceptive-coverage requirement was in effect and therefore women with a \n4  self-funded health plan were similarly guaranteed access to cost-free contraceptive coverage.  \n5  72.  The California Health Care Foundation estimates that as of 2015, 6.6 million \n6  Californians were covered by a self-funded employer health plan.  Therefore, the Exemption \n7  Rules could affect hundreds of thousands of these California women that have a self-funded \n8  health plan and are not protected by California’s Contraceptive Equity Act.  The federal \n9  government estimates that women of reproductive age compose 20.2% of the population.  Thus, \n10  even using the government’s own estimate, 1.3 million women in California are of reproductive \n11  age, have a self-funded health plan, and are susceptible to losing their statutorily entitled \n12  contraceptive coverage healthcare benefits due to the Contraception Exemption Rules.   \n13  73.  In California, if women do not receive cost-free contraceptive coverage from their \n14  employer, California will have to absorb the financial and administrative burden of ensuring \n15  access to contraceptive coverage.  Due to the Exemption Rules, California women will be forced \n16  to utilize the state’s Family Planning, Access, Care, and Treatment (Family PACT) program \n17  provided they meet certain eligibility requirements.  Family PACT is administered by the Office \n18  of Family Planning (OFP), an entity within the California Department of Health Care Services, \n19  which, by virtue of legislation enacted in 1996, is charged by the California Legislature to make \n20  available to citizens of the State who are of childbearing age comprehensive medical knowledge, \n21  assistance, and services relating to the planning of families.  Family planning allows women to \n22  decide for themselves the number, timing, and spacing of their children.  \n23  74.  In 1996 (before the enactment of the ACA), California enacted legislation to create \n24  Family PACT.  Family PACT is California’s innovative approach to provide comprehensive \n25  family planning services.  The goal of Family PACT is to promote optimal reproductive health \n26  and to reduce unplanned pregnancy by lowering the barriers that many women with unmet needs \n27  face in obtaining family planning services.  The program fills a critical gap in healthcare for \n28  under-insured and uninsured Californians.  Family PACT is available to eligible low-income \n  25   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 26 of 68\n \n1  (under 200% of federal poverty level) men and women who are residents of California and do not \n2  have access to family planning coverage.  Currently, the program serves 1.1 million eligible men \n3  and women of childbearing age through a network of 2,200 public and private providers.  \n4  Services include comprehensive education, assistance, and services relating to family planning.  \n5  These Californians have no other source of healthcare coverage for family planning services (or \n6  they meet the criteria specified for eligibility) and they have a medical necessity for family \n7  planning services.   \n8  75.  The 2,200 clinic and private practice clinician provider entities enroll women in \n9  Family PACT across the State.  Family PACT clinician providers include private physicians in \n10  nonprofit community-based clinics, obstetricians and gynecologists, general practice physicians, \n11  family practice doctors, internal medicine physicians, and pediatricians.  Medi-Cal licensed \n12  pharmacies and laboratories also participate by referral from enrolled Family PACT clinicians.   \n13  76.  Planned Parenthood is one example of a Family PACT provider that enrolls women \n14  into the program, as they screen every patient for Family PACT.  Planned Parenthood currently \n15  serves approximately 850,000 patients a year through 115 health centers.  California reimburses \n16  Planned Parenthood for family planning services provided.  For every dollar Planned Parenthood \n17  spends on family planning services, the federal government contributes 77.49 cents while \n18  California spends 22.51 cents.   \n19  77.  Because health facilities, including but not limited to Planned Parenthood, will see a \n20  spike in patients seeking contraceptive coverage as a result of the Contraception Exemption \n21  Rules, California will be fiscally impacted through increased enrollment in Family PACT. \n22  78.  California benefits from the largest Title X program in the nation, which funds \n23  providers throughout the State to support the delivery of quality preventive and reproductive \n24  healthcare.  California’s Title X family planning program collectively serves more than one \n25  million patients annually—over 25% of all Title X patients nationwide—through 59 healthcare \n26  organizations, operating nearly 350 health centers in 37 of California’s 58 counties.  All Title X \n27  clinics screen women for coverage on the Family PACT program. \n28 \n  26   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 27 of 68\n \n1  79.  Despite these safety-net healthcare programs, in 2014, 2.6 million California women \n2  were in need of publicly funded family planning and the State’s family planning network was \n3  only able to meet 50% of this need.  California will be unable to absorb the increase in patients \n4  seeking contraceptive coverage.   \n5  CONNECTICUT \n6  80.  In 2010, Connecticut’s rate of unintended pregnancy was 46%. \n7  81.  In Connecticut, 68.8% of women aged 18-49 use contraception, including 72.8% of \n8  women at risk of unintended pregnancy.   \n9  82.  In 2010, public costs for unintended pregnancies in Connecticut were $208.5 million, \n10  $128.4 million of which was paid by the federal government and $80.1 million by the state.    \n11  83.  In 2014, publicly funded contraceptive providers, including Title X providers, could \n12  only supply 38% of Connecticut’s need for publicly funded contraceptive services.   \n13  84.  In 2017, Title X clinics in Connecticut served over 43,000 individuals at 17 different \n14  sites.  About 85% of all those served had incomes below 250% of the federal poverty level. \n15  85.  In Connecticut, forty percent (40%) of Title X patients had incomes at or below 101% \n16  of the federal poverty level, forty-six (46%) had incomes between 101% -250% of the federal \n17  poverty level, and thirteen percent (13%) had incomes more than 250% of the federal poverty \n18  level.   \n19  86.  In 1999, Connecticut passed its contraceptive equity law which requires that every \n20  individual insurance plan that covers outpatient prescription drugs may not exclude coverage for \n21  prescription contraceptive methods.  Conn. Gen. Stat. sec. 38a-503e.  The law does not require \n22  no-cost contraceptive coverage.  This means that most women in Connecticut will be harmed by \n23  the Contraception Exemption rules which ensures women no-cost coverage of all FDA-approved \n24  contraceptives. \n25  87.  There are at least four Connecticut employers, with 8,751 employees, which will \n26  likely exempt themselves. \n27 \n28 \n  27   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 28 of 68\n \n1  DELAWARE \n2  88.  Delaware had the highest unintended pregnancy rate in the country in 2010, at a rate \n3  of 62 such pregnancies per 1,000 women aged 15-44.  These unintended pregnancies cost \n4  Delaware and the federal government $94.2 million.  Limiting or removing access to \n5  contraception under the Contraception Exemption Rules will result in an increase in increased \n6  number of women in need of publicly funded care and an increased rate of unintended \n7  pregnancies in the State of Delaware, which adds a fiscal and administrative burden on the State \n8  in the form of increased enrollment in state-funded or sponsored family planning programs.  In \n9  Delaware, 71% of unintended pregnancies are paid for by the State. \n10  89.  In 2000, the Delaware General Assembly passed legislation mandating contraceptive \n11  coverage for state-regulated group and blanket health insurance plans.  In 2018, it expanded the \n12  contraceptive coverage mandate by enacting Senate Bill 151 (the “2018 Delaware Contraceptive \n13  Equity Act”), requiring all state-regulated individual, group and blanket health insurance policies \n14  delivered or issued for delivery in the State to provide coverage for all FDA-approved \n15  prescription contraceptives and other outpatient services related to the use of such drugs and \n16  devices.  This legislation also applies to the State employee health plan and public assistance \n17  plans.  In passing the 2018 Delaware Contraceptive Equity Act, the Delaware General Assembly \n18  sought to ensure access to cost-free contraceptive coverage as contemplated by the ACA. \n19  90.  Unlike other states’ contraceptive equity legislation, the 2018 Delaware \n20  Contraceptive Equity Act does not prohibit cost sharing altogether.  Rather, cost sharing is \n21  permissible “as long as at least 1 drug, device, or other product for that [contraceptive] method is \n22  available without cost-sharing.”  The result of enforcing the Contraception Exemption Rules is \n23  the removal in Delaware of the guaranteed free access to all FDA-approved contraceptive \n24  coverage for women provided for under the ACA.    \n25  91.  The 2018 Delaware Contraceptive Equity Act only applies to state-regulated health \n26  plans.  It does not apply to self-funded health plans (other than the State employee health plan), \n27  through which over 30% of Delawareans are insured.  Self-funded health plans are governed by \n28 \n  28   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 29 of 68\n \n1  ERISA and are regulated by the U.S. Department of Labor, Employee Benefits Security \n2  Administration. \n3  92.  In Delaware, if women do not have guaranteed free access to contraceptive coverage \n4  from their employers as a result of the Contraception Exemption Rules, the financial and \n5  administrative burden of providing access to such services will fall back on the State through the \n6  increased enrollment in Medicaid or State-funded programs aimed at providing contraceptives to \n7  women who are otherwise unable to access or afford such coverage elsewhere. \n8  93.  Under Title X of the Public Health Services Act, the Division of Public Health (DPH) \n9  within the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services offers a wide range of \n10  reproductive health services and supplies to women in the State of Delaware.  Family planning \n11  services provided by DPH include family planning counseling, birth control supplies, counseling, \n12  education, and referral services, and testing for sexually transmitted diseases.   \n13  94.  DPH services are available to eligible low-income (under 250% of the federal poverty \n14  level) Delawareans.  Fees for these services and supplies are based on income, and for \n15  Delawareans with income at or below 100% of the federal poverty level these services are \n16  provided at no charge.  In 2016, DPH provided services under the Title X program to 18,824 \n17  eligible Delawareans. \n18  95.  The current Title X family planning budget for Delaware for fiscal year 2018 is \n19  $810,000, which covers a 7-month budget period.  It has been communicated from the Office of \n20  Population Affairs that in fiscal year 2019, the program will be flat-funded.  Delaware’s Title X \n21  program is already operating at maximum capacity.  The current Delaware network of providers \n22  does not have the capacity or the funding to provide services to additional clients impacted by the \n23  loss of contraceptive coverage due to the Contraception Exemption Rules. \n24  96.  Planned Parenthood of Delaware (PPDE) is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization that \n25  works to provide reproductive healthcare services across the State of Delaware.  PPDE currently \n26  serves approximately 8,000 patients each year in three health centers and at mobile sites.  PPDE \n27  primarily serves low-income patients with limited access to healthcare services, and in fiscal year \n28  2017, PPDE provided contraception to nearly 5,600 patients. \n  29   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 30 of 68\n \n1  97.  Delaware reimburses PPDE for family planning services it provides, either through \n2  the Medicaid program or Title X.  For every dollar PPDE spends on family planning services, the \n3  federal government contributes 90 cents and Delaware spends 10 cents. \n4  98.  Because DPH and other publicly funded service providers like PPDE will likely see a \n5  spike in the number of Delawareans seeking contraceptive coverage as a result of the \n6  Contraception Exemption Rules, Delaware will be fiscally impacted through increased enrollment \n7  in its family planning programs.  Delaware will also be fiscally impacted by any increase in \n8  unintended pregnancies as a result of the Contraception Exemption Rules, the majority of which \n9  are paid for by the State.  \n10  DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n11  99.  In the District of Columbia, 48% of all pregnancies were unintended in 2010.  Of \n12  those unplanned pregnancies that resulted in births, over 84% were publicly-funded, costing the \n13  District more than $13.3 million for unintended pregnancies in 2010. \n14  100.  In 2018, the D.C. Council passed the Vital Records Modernization Act of 2018, D.C. \n15  Law 22-164 (Act 22-438), which amended the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Federal Law \n16  Conformity Act of 2000 to require individual and group health plans to cover all FDA-approved \n17  contraceptive drugs, devices, products and services for women without cost-sharing no later than \n18  January 1, 2019.  See D.C. Code § 31-3834.03.   \n19  101.  The District of Columbia’s Vital Records Modernization Act of 2018 however, only \n20  applies to D.C.-regulated health plans, through which over 54% of covered workers are insured.  \n21  Self-funded health plans are governed by the Federal Employee Retirement Income Act of 1974 \n22  (ERISA) and are regulated by the U.S. Department of Labor, Employee Benefits Security \n23  Administration.  Notably, when the District of Columbia passed the Vital Records Modernization \n24  Act of 2018, the IFRS were enjoined from taking effect, so women with a self-funded health plan \n25  were similarly guaranteed access to cost-free contraceptive coverage. \n26  102.  District law also permits pharmacists to prescribe as well as dispense prescription \n27  methods of contraception for up to a 12-month supply at one time for women who do not face \n28  serious risks from contraception.  D.C. Code § 31-3834.01.  The purpose of the provision is to \n  30   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 31 of 68\n \n1  eliminate barriers to continuous contraceptive use, thereby helping reduce the possibility of an \n2  unintended pregnancy.  The provision requires individual and group health plans to cover a full-\n3  year supply of prescription contraceptives.  Id. \n4  103.  As a result of the Exemption Rules, more women who are insured will seek family \n5  planning services from publicly-funded programs in the District.  In the District of Columbia, \n6  85% of funding for family planning services is from Medicaid and 14% from Title X.   Publicly \n7  supported health centers provided contraceptive care to 37,570 women in DC in 2014, including \n8  32,670 women served by Title X–supported centers.  Health centers in DC served 6,850 teenage \n9  women in 2014, including 5,980 teens served by Title X–supported centers. These totals amount \n10  to substantial proportions—but not nearly all—of the women in need of publicly supported \n11  contraception. \n12  104.  In the District, childless adults are eligible for Medicaid only if they make no more \n13  than 215% of the federal poverty level. Parents are eligible for Medicaid if they make up to 221% \n14  of the federal poverty level.  Thus, many women and teenage girls who find that their employer-\n15  sponsored health plans don’t cover contraceptives under the Exemption Rules will also be \n16  ineligible for family-planning funded by Medicaid. \n17  105.  The District’s Title X grantees supported more than 55,000 individuals in the District \n18  in 2017, 60% of whom had incomes at or below 100% of the federal poverty level, and 85% of \n19  whom had incomes at or below 250% of the federal poverty level.  As a result of the Exemption \n20  Rules, more women who are insured by employer-sponsored health plans will seek family \n21  planning services from Title X grantees in the District.  Title X funding is limited, though, and is \n22  generally used in the areas of greatest need.  It is unlikely that the District’s Title X grantees will \n23  be able to meet additional demand for services without a significant increase in funding.  In the \n24  absence of additional funding, the District will see an increase in unintended pregnancies.  Either \n25  scenario would create a negative fiscal impact on the District.  The District is one of only five \n26  states that experienced an increase in the number of female contraceptive clients served at \n27  publicly-funded clinics between 2010 and 2014. \n28  106.  If women cannot access no-cost contraceptives because of the Exemption Rules, \n  31   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 32 of 68\n \n1  unplanned pregnancies will increase.  Unplanned pregnancies in the District also contribute to the \n2  District’s maternal and infant mortality rates, which are already among the highest in the Nation.  \n3  From 2005 to 2014, an average of about 39 women per 100,000 live births in the District died due \n4  to causes related to pregnancy.  The District’s maternal mortality rate is more than double the \n5  national average of about 17 women who died per 100,000 live births.  The District’s infant \n6  mortality rate decreased from 13.1 per 1,000 live births in 2007 to 7.1 per 1,000 live births in \n7  2016, yet continues to exceed the national rate of 6.0 per 1,000 live births.  While the infant \n8  mortality rate in the District has trended downward over the last decade, an increase in unplanned \n9  pregnancies would threaten this hard-won progress. \n10  107.  An increase in unplanned births in the District will also impose burdens on District \n11  programs that support women during pregnancy and after childbirth. The DC Maternal, Infant and \n12  Early Childhood Home Visitation and DC Healthy Start (DCHS) programs provide District \n13  families with prenatal, newborn and infant care education; connections with preventive health and \n14  prenatal services, including lactation support; support for child development; and parenting \n15  education.  DCHS is a federally funded program under the HRSA that aims to improve birth \n16  outcomes for infants and women of child bearing age.  If the unplanned birth rate goes up, there \n17  will be a greater need for these publicly-funded programs. \n18  108.  There are at least 12 District of Columbia employers, with 20,059 employees, which \n19  will likely exempt themselves. \n20  HAWAII \n21  109.  In 2010, 45% of all pregnancies in Hawaii were unintended. \n22  110.  In Hawaii, 61.8% of women aged 18-49 use contraception, including 69.2% of \n23  women at risk of unintended pregnancy.   \n24  111.  In 2010, public costs for unintended pregnancies in Hawaii were $114.5 million, \n25  $76.7 million of which was paid for by the federal government and $37.8 million by Hawaii.  \n26  112.  The Hawaii Department of Health administers the State’s Title X family planning \n27  grant and related reproductive and women’s health programs.  Title X grant helps to fund \n28  approximately 58% of Hawaii’s family planning services.  In 2016, Title X grant funding \n  32   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 33 of 68\n \n1  provided approximately 16,000 women and men comprehensive family planning and related \n2  preventative health services, including contraceptive services and client centered education, \n3  counseling, and referrals.  These services are provided on six islands, through 12 contracts, at 30 \n4  service sites throughout the State.  These sites include, but are not limited to eight Federally \n5  Qualified Health Centers in medically underserved rural areas.    \n6  113.  Hawaii’s Medicaid program, Med-QUEST, provides contraceptive coverage, family \n7  planning services, maternity and newborn care, and pregnancy related services in its coverage.  \n8  Med-QUEST covers adults up to 133% of the federal poverty level, covers pregnant women up to \n9  191% of the federal poverty level, and covers children up to 308% of the federal poverty level.  In \n10  2005, almost 1 in 3 births were Medicaid insured.    \n11  114.   The State of Hawaii has a law that that mandates employer group accident and health \n12  or sickness plans to provide contraceptive services or supplies.  Haw. Rev. Stat. § 432:1-604.5 \n13  (2013).  Hawaii law permits an insurer to collect copayments on contraceptive supplies so long as \n14  they are not unusual.  Hawaii law provides that coverage shall include reimbursement to a health \n15  care provider or dispensing entity for prescription contraceptive supplies intended to last up to a \n16  twelve-month period for an insured and that coverage of contraceptive services shall extend to \n17  any dependent of the subscriber who is covered under the policy.  The State of Hawaii law does \n18  not cover women and covered dependents who have coverage through an employer that uses a \n19  self-insured plan governed by the federal ERISA and regulated by the U.S. Department of Labor, \n20  Employee Benefits Security Administration.  Therefore, Hawaii individuals enrolled in an \n21  ERISA-regulated plan that uses an exemption or accommodation under the Final Rules will not \n22  be protected by Hawaii law.  Hawaii has 30.5% of its workforce in a self-insured plan.   \n23  115.  Women who lose coverage in Hawaii will have to resort to Title X family planning \n24  services which will place a larger fiscal burden on Title X funding.   \n25  116.  In addition, Medicaid eligible women may enroll in Medicaid to receive coverage of \n26  services or in the alternative, they may forgo contraceptives and be at risk of having unintended \n27  pregnancies.  Medicaid eligible women may turn to Medicaid to provide coverage for resulting \n28 \n  33   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 34 of 68\n \n1  unintended pregnancies and births in addition to coverage for newborn care which would increase \n2  the financial responsibility of Hawaii’s Medicaid program \n3  117.  In 2014, publicly funded contraceptive providers, including Title X providers, could \n4  only supply 25% of Hawaiians’ need for publicly funded contraceptive services.  \n5  118.  There is at least one Hawaii employer, with 877 employees, which will likely exempt \n6  itself. \n7  ILLINOIS \n8  119.  In Illinois, 42% of all pregnancies in 2010 were unplanned; 78% of those were \n9  publicly funded, costing Illinois $352.2 million. \n10  120.  Since 2004, Illinois law has required state-regulated individual and group accident \n11  and health insurance policies (“state-regulated insurance policies”) to provide coverage for all \n12  outpatient contraceptive services and all outpatient contraceptive drugs and devices approved by \n13  the FDA.  Illinois Insurance Code, 215 Ill. Comp. Stat. § 5/356z.4; Public Act 93-102 (eff. Jan. 1, \n14  2004).  In January 2016, the law was expanded to require coverage for all over-the-counter \n15  contraceptive drugs, devices, and products approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, \n16  excluding male condoms. Public Act 99-672 (eff. Jan. 1, 2017).  It also was amended to prohibit \n17  state-regulated insurance from imposing a deductible, coinsurance, copayment, or any other cost-\n18  sharing requirement on contraceptive coverage and to require the dispensing of 12 months’ worth \n19  of contraception at one time.  Id.  The law also requires coverage of contraceptive services, \n20  patient education, and counseling on contraception, as well as voluntary sterilization procedures.  \n21  Id. \n22  121.  This contraceptive equity law does not, however, apply to employer-sponsored self-\n23  funded health plans governed by ERISA and regulated by the U.S. Department of Labor, \n24  Employee Benefits Security Administration.  Therefore, Illinois individuals enrolled in an \n25  ERISA-regulated plan that uses an exemption or accommodation under the Final Rules will not \n26  be protected by Illinois law. \n27  122.  Illinois funds two statewide programs that provide access to contraception that may \n28  be further burdened if Illinois women lose contraceptive coverage due to the Final Rules. Those \n  34   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 35 of 68\n \n1  two programs are the Illinois Department of Public Health (“IDPH”) Family Planning Program \n2  and the Illinois Medicaid program. \n3  123.  The State of Illinois provides contraceptive coverage through the IDPH Family \n4  Planning Program.  IDPH is a grantee in the federal Title X National Family Planning Program, \n5  administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  The IDPH Family Planning \n6  Program provides funding to more than 66 clinic sites throughout Illinois, including health \n7  departments, hospital-based clinics, single services not-for-profit agencies, federally qualified \n8  health centers, and community-based organizations for the provision of family planning services, \n9  including contraceptives. Two additional grantees, Planned Parenthood of Illinois and Aunt \n10  Martha’s Youth Service Center, also provide contraceptive services to Illinois residents through \n11  the Title X program. In 2014, 86,830 women received Title X-supported contraceptive services in \n12  Illinois.    \n13  124.  Women who lose contraceptive coverage are likely to seek services at a Title X \n14  clinic, including those funded by the IDPH Family Planning Program.  In 2014, over 4.7 million \n15  women were in need of publicly-supported contraceptive services and supplies in Illinois.  Of \n16  those, 18% were uninsured.  At that level, only 20% of the need for publicly-funded contraceptive \n17  services was met; 11% of that need was met by Title X-funded clinics.  If the number of \n18  uninsured women in need of publicly-supported contraceptive services increases due to the Final \n19  Rules, the State would experience additional financial and administrative burdens to meet the \n20  needs at clinics funded by the IDPH Family Planning Program. \n21  125.  The State of Illinois also provides contraceptive coverage through its Illinois \n22  Medicaid program, which covers “reproductive health care that is otherwise legal in Illinois.”  \n23  Illinois Public Aid Code, 305 Ill. Comp. Stat. § 5/5-5.  Such coverage is provided to adults with \n24  incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level.  Id. at § 5/5-2.  As a result of the Final Rules, \n25  more women may seek Medicaid coverage for themselves or their children, creating additional \n26  financial burdens on the State. \n27  126.  Women who lose coverage may also forego seeking contraceptives and related \n28  services, creating an increased risk of unplanned pregnancies. In 2010, 78.3% of births from \n  35   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 36 of 68\n \n1  unplanned pregnancies in Illinois were publicly funded – a total of 55,000 births.  Those births \n2  cost the State of Illinois approximately $352.2 million in 2010. Any increase in the number of \n3  unplanned pregnancies experienced because of the Final Rules is therefore likely to cause an \n4  increase in State expenditures. \n5  127.  There are at least 21 Illinois employers, with 41,582 employees, which will likely \n6  exempt themselves. \n7  MARYLAND \n8  128.  Maryland has the fourth highest unintended pregnancy rate in the country.  In 2010, \n9  71,000 or 58% of all pregnancies were unintended.  Of those unplanned pregnancies that resulted \n10  in births, 58.2% were publicly funded, costing Maryland $180.9 million. \n11  129.  In 1998, the Maryland Legislature mandated contraceptive coverage for certain state-\n12  regulated plans.  In 2016, it built upon this earlier law in enacting the Maryland Contraceptive \n13  Equity Act.  The Maryland Contraceptive Equity Act, which went into effect January 2018, \n14  extends the contraceptive-coverage requirements under the ACA by expanding the number of \n15  contraception options available without co-payment, requiring coverage of over-the-counter \n16  contraceptive medications, providing for coverage of up to six-months dispensing of birth control, \n17  and expanding vasectomy coverage without cost-sharing and deductible requirements.  In 2018, \n18  Maryland again improved coverage by providing coverage of up to twelve-months of birth \n19  control beginning January 1, 2020.  With the contraceptive mandate in 1998 and the Maryland \n20  Contraceptive Equity Act in 2016, later amended in 2018, the State has demonstrated its long-\n21  standing commitment to ensuring access to contraceptive coverage. \n22  130.  Maryland’s contraceptive coverage law applies only to state-regulated health plans.  It \n23  does not apply to self-insured commercial health plans, through which 50% of covered \n24  Marylanders are insured.  The Maryland Insurance Administration estimates that as of 2017, \n25  nearly 1.49 million Marylanders were covered by a self-insured commercial health plan. \n26  131.  Maryland funds three statewide programs that provide access to contraception.  Due \n27  to the Exemption Rules, Maryland women who lose contraceptive coverage may be forced to rely \n28  on these statewide programs, creating an administrative and financial burden on the State.    \n  36   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 37 of 68\n \n1  132.  The Maryland Title X Program supported 73,018 individuals across Maryland in \n2  2017.  The program provides family planning-related services on a sliding fee scale for \n3  participants with incomes up to 250% of federal poverty level.  The program covers the uninsured \n4  and underinsured who need wrap-around services.  Through these services, Maryland assisted \n5  women in preventing 15,000 unintended pregnancies in 2014.  As a result of the Exemption \n6  Rules, more women who are insured will seek wrap-around family planning services from the \n7  Title X Program.  The Program has a finite budget of $9.9 million, which includes $6 million in \n8  state funds and $3.9 million in federal funds historically.  Maryland will be unable to meet the \n9  additional demand for services without a significant increase in funding, and a failure to fund will \n10  lead to an increase in unintended pregnancies.  Both scenarios create a negative fiscal impact on \n11  Maryland.   \n12  133.  The Medicaid Family Planning Waiver Program provides contraceptive coverage to \n13  women and men up to 250% of the federal poverty level.  In fiscal year 2018, the average \n14  monthly enrollment was 9,618 individuals.  Program expenditures were $279,228 in fiscal 2018, \n15  with a split of 10%/90% in state and federal funding, respectively.  This program provides \n16  coverage for the uninsured as well as wrap-around coverage for the underinsured.  With the \n17  Exemption Rules, more women with insurance will likely seek coverage for contraceptives under \n18  the Medicaid Family Planning Waiver Program.  Maryland will be fiscally impacted through \n19  increased enrollment. \n20  134.  Medicaid and the Maryland Children’s Health Program (MCHP) cover family \n21  planning services.  Maryland covers individuals up to 138% of the federal poverty level in \n22  Medicaid and 300% federal poverty level in MCHP.   As a result of the Exemption Rules, more \n23  women in low income jobs may seek Medicaid coverage for themselves or MCHP coverage for \n24  their children as a result of the loss of contraception coverage in their employers’ plans.  Thus, \n25  financial burden of coverage would shift to the State.  Most adults and children receive their \n26  coverage through the managed care program called HealthChoice.  In calendar year 2017, \n27  HealthChoice expenditures for family planning were $42.5 million in total funds.  Family \n28  planning services are generally covered under a 10%/90% split of state and federal funds. \n  37   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 38 of 68\n \n1  135.  Women who lose coverage may also simply seek services at Planned Parenthood and \n2  other community-based providers.  These providers generally offer services on a sliding fee scale \n3  for low-income patients.  Under a sliding fee scale, the provider pays for a portion of the services.  \n4  These providers may not have the financial capacity to absorb the cost of care for an influx of \n5  patients who have lost contraceptive coverage. \n6  136.  Finally, women may simply choose to forgo seeking contraceptive and related \n7  services if they do not have the means to pay for it, thereby risking unintended pregnancy and \n8  other poor health outcomes related to reproductive care.  Because the State pays for delivery \n9  services for certain low-income women who are uninsured, the State bears a financial risk when \n10  women lose contraceptive coverage.  In 2010, the State paid for 19,000 unintended pregnancies \n11  that resulted in birth.  The State is also obligated to pay for newborn care, which can be expensive \n12  if there are complications, when those newborns are enrolled in MCHP. \n13  MINNESOTA \n14  137.  In Minnesota, 40% of all pregnancies were unintended in 2010.  Of those unplanned \n15  pregnancies that resulted in births, 66.7% were publicly-funded, costing the State of Minnesota \n16  $128.7 million for medical costs incurred with respect to those pregnancies. \n17  138.  Minnesota does not have a contraceptive equity law or similar state law requiring \n18  employers and insurers to provide contraception coverage for women under either self-funded \n19  health plans or state-regulated health plans.  Therefore, the Contraception Exemption Rules could \n20  affect every Minnesota woman who obtains healthcare through her employer. \n21  139.  According to the U.S. Department of Labor, approximately 3.3 million Minnesotans \n22  (60%) obtain their health insurance coverage from employer-sponsored plans.10  A more recent \n23  survey conducted by the Minnesota Department of Health in partnership with the University of \n24  Minnesota found that 52.9 percent of Minnesotans had health insurance coverage through their \n25  employer.11  \n26 \n                                                           \n10 https://www.dol.gov/sites/default/files/ebsa/researchers/data/health-and-welfare/health-\n27  insurance-coverage-bulletin-2016.pdf. \n11 http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/hpsc/hep/publications/mnha2017primfind.pdf.  \n28 \n  38   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 39 of 68\n \n1  140.  Medical Assistance (“MA”) is Minnesota’s Medicaid program for people with low \n2  income.  The program is administered by the Minnesota Department of Human Services.  In fiscal \n3  year 2017, MA provided coverage to a monthly average of 1.1 million Minnesotans.  MA covers \n4  comprehensive family planning services.  The cost of family planning services is paid for with \n5  State and Federal funds with the federal government generally covering 90 percent and the State \n6  of Minnesota covering 10 percent, respectively. \n7  141.  The Minnesota Department of Human Services also administers the Minnesota \n8  Family Planning Program (“MFPP”).  The program provides access to family planning services \n9  for low-income Minnesotans who are not enrolled in MA subject to certain eligibility \n10  requirements.   The family planning services covered by MFPP include, for example, family \n11  planning office visits, education, various birth control methods, and transportation to and from a \n12  provider of family planning services.  In 2017, the program served a total of more than 20,000 \n13  people, with a monthly average enrollment of approximately 11,000.  Total spending for the \n14  program was about $8.6 million.  The cost of MFPP services is paid for with State and Federal \n15  funds with the federal government generally covering 90 percent and the State of Minnesota \n16  covering 10 percent, respectively. \n17  142.  Minnesota women who lose contraceptive coverage due to the Exemption Rules may \n18  seek coverage from state-funded programs like MA or MFPP or they may forgo coverage and risk \n19  experiencing an unintended pregnancy.  Either scenario imposes an administrative and financial \n20  burden on the State of Minnesota.   \n21  143.  According to 2010 census data, there are 1,045,681 women in Minnesota between the \n22  ages of 15 and 44.   \n23  144.  There are at least 11 Minnesota employers, with 24,413 employees, which will likely \n24  exempt themselves. \n25  NEW YORK \n26  145.  New York has one of the highest rates of unintended pregnancy in the nation.  In \n27  2010, the rate of unintended pregnancies was 61 per 1,000 women.  Fifty-five percent of all \n28  pregnancies in New York State were unintended in 2010. \n  39   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 40 of 68\n \n1  146.  The risk of unintended pregnancy is greatest for the most vulnerable women in New \n2  York: young, low-income, minority women without high school or college education.  In New \n3  York in 2010, the percent of births that resulted from an unintended pregnancy was twice as high \n4  among African-American women, and about 1.5 times higher among Hispanic women, compared \n5  to Caucasian women.  Young women with some college education had half as many unintended \n6  pregnancies as high school graduates and one third that of non-graduates.  Unmarried young \n7  women with no high school diploma had the highest unintended pregnancy rate. \n8  147.  In 2010, 59,000, or approximately 70%, of unplanned births in New York were \n9  publicly funded.  In 2010, the federal and New York State governments together spent $1.5 \n10  billion on births, abortions, and miscarriages resulting from unintended pregnancies; of this, \n11  $937.7 million was paid by the federal government, and $601.1 million was paid by New York.  \n12  In that same year, the total public costs for unintended pregnancies in New York was $380 per \n13  woman aged 15–44.  \n14  148.  New York has protected women’s access to contraceptive coverage through both \n15  legislation and law enforcement.  In 2003, New York enacted the Women’s Health and Wellness \n16  Act (WHWA), which requires plans governed by New York State law (“fully insured plans” or \n17  “state-regulated plans”) to cover contraceptives for female members.  N.Y. Pub. Health L. § 602 \n18  (2003).  Stating that “access to contraceptive services is essential to women’s health and \n19  equality,” the New York State Assembly cited the extensive evidence of contraception use’s \n20  efficacy, and the consequent improvements in public health and the wellbeing of women and their \n21  families.  The Assembly noted that “all New Yorkers, regardless of economic status, should have \n22  timely access to contraception and the information they need in order to protect their health, plan \n23  their families and their future.” \n24  149.    After the ACA’s preventive requirements became effective and plans were required \n25  to provide contraceptives with no cost sharing, in 2015 the New York Attorney General  \n26  investigated allegations that health plans were not adhering to these requirements, with the result \n27  that plans corrected any failures, and refunded those members who had paid in error. \n28 \n  40   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 41 of 68\n \n1  150.  In January 2017, the New York State Department of Financial Services issued \n2  Regulation 62, requiring that state-regulated plans not impose cost sharing for contraceptives on \n3  plan members.  New York is one of only eight states that require no cost sharing. \n4  151.  New York’s WHWA and Regulation 62 do not apply to self-funded health insurance \n5  plans.  Those plans are governed by ERISA and are regulated by the U.S. Department of Labor, \n6  Employee Benefits Security Administration, and have over the years increasingly covered a \n7  growing percentage of New York members. \n8  152.  As a result of the Contraception Exemption Rules, New York employers will qualify \n9  for expanded exemptions and not need to make any accommodations for women to access health \n10  plan coverage for contraceptives.  While some of these women may be able to pay for their \n11  contraceptive care, many others will likely seek state-funded programs that provide free or low-\n12  cost contraceptives.  These costs will be borne by New York State. \n13  153.  A variety of New York State programs help to provide family planning services for \n14  hundreds of thousands of women in New York.  For example, publicly supported family planning \n15  centers in New York in 2014 served 390,350 female contraceptive clients, and helped avert \n16  94,500 unintended pregnancies the same year, which would have resulted in 45,900 unplanned \n17  births and 34,100 abortions.  In 2010, publicly funded family planning services in New York \n18  helped save the federal and state governments approximately $830 million. \n19  154.  New York State’s Family Benefit program covers women up to 223% of the federal \n20  poverty line.  In 2016, over 300,000 New York women and men received services through the \n21  New York Department of Health’s family planning programs.  Women in low-income jobs whose \n22  employers choose exemption from contraceptive coverage may qualify for this program, thereby \n23  shifting the costs of contraceptives for these women to New York State.   \n24  155.  New York State’s Children’s Health Insurance Plan (CHIP) provides coverage for the \n25  children of women up to 400% of the federal poverty line.  In 2016, there were approximately \n26  684,625 children up to 19 years old enrolled in New York’s CHIP program, and the State spent \n27  approximately $156 million on the program.  Women whose employers avail themselves of the \n28  Exemption Rule’s broad exemption may turn to the CHIP program for contraceptive coverage for \n  41   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 42 of 68\n \n1  their preteen and teenage children, a demographic particularly at risk for unintended pregnancy.  \n2  These costs would be borne by New York State. \n3  156.  In addition, women whose health plans no longer cover contraceptive care may turn \n4  to providers like Planned Parenthood.  But such providers, and Planned Parenthood in particular, \n5  may be unable to satisfy the demand for contraceptive services, because Planned Parenthood \n6  clinics are increasingly at risk of exclusion from federal funding programs including Medicaid, \n7  with the result that some clinics may be forced to close.   \n8  157.  Finally, some women without available contraceptive coverage will forgo \n9  contraceptive care altogether or consistent contraceptive care, with the consequence of increases \n10  in unintended pregnancies together with all of the attendant costs, including healthcare risks to \n11  women and children – many of which will be borne by New York State. \n12  158.  New York has 178 Title X clinics that served 305,464 patients in 2017.   \n13  NORTH CAROLINA \n14  159.  An estimated 45% of pregnancies are unintended in North Carolina in 2010.  Of those \n15  unplanned pregnancies in 2010 over 55% were publicly-funded, costing the State $214.7 million. \n16  160.  In North Carolina, 73.8% of women aged 18-49 use contraception, including 77.2% \n17  of women at risk of unintended pregnancy. \n18  161.  In North Carolina, 41% of public funding for family planning services is from \n19  Medicaid and 10% from Title X.   \n20  162.  In 2015, Title X clinics in North Carolina served more than 125,905 individuals at \n21  120 different sites.  About 80% of all those served had incomes below 250% of the federal \n22  poverty level and about 55% of Title X patients had incomes at or below 100% of the federal \n23  poverty level.   \n24  163.  In 1999, North Carolina passed a contraceptive equity law which requires that every \n25  individual insurance plan that covers outpatient prescription drugs may not exclude coverage for \n26  prescription contraceptive methods.  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 58-3-176 (now codified at N.C. Gen. Stat. \n27  § 58-3-178).  The law does not require no-cost contraceptive coverage and it does not require that \n28  all FDA-approved methods of contraception are covered.   \n  42   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 43 of 68\n \n1  164.  Therefore, women in North Carolina would be harmed by the Contraception \n2  Exemption rules because women in the state do not benefit from a state law that mirrors the \n3  federal ACA guaranteed on contraception coverage.  These women would likely go without the \n4  coverage or face high-out of pocket costs, leading to an increase in unintended pregnancies; or \n5  seek coverage through Medicaid.  \n6  165.  There are at least four North Carolina employers, with 4,169 employees, which will \n7  likely exempt themselves. \n8  RHODE ISLAND \n9  166.  In 2010, Rhode Island’s rate of unintended pregnancy was 43%. \n10  167.  The State of Rhode Island provides publicly funded contraceptive coverage through \n11  its state Medicaid Program and the Title X Family Planning Program. There are about 222,000 \n12  women in need of contraceptive services in Rhode Island. Rhode Island’s Title X Family \n13  Planning Program serves about 26,00 patients each year.  Rhode Island’s Medicaid Program \n14  provides extended family planning benefits for two years post-partum. \n15  168.  The State of Rhode Island has state laws that require some, but not all, of the \n16  contraceptive coverage mandated by the ACA.  Specifically, Rhode Island state laws provide that \n17  every individual or group health insurance contract, plan, or policy that provides prescription \n18  coverage and is delivered, issued for delivery, or renewed in Rhode Island must provide coverage \n19  for FDA-approved prescription contraceptive drugs and devices.  Coverage for the prescription \n20  drug RU 486 is not required.  R.I. GEN. LAWS § 27-19-48(a) (hospital service corporation); R.I. \n21  GEN. LAWS § 27-18-57(a) (insurance company); R.I. GEN. LAWS § 27-20-43(a) (nonprofit \n22  medical service corporation); R.I. GEN. LAWS § 27-41-59(a) (health maintenance corporation).    \n23  169.  Rhode Island state insurance law does not specifically require insurance coverage for \n24  family planning counseling and services used by women, except where a pregnant woman \n25  receives Medicaid services under the State’s Rite Start program. See RIGL 42-12.3-3(f).12 \n26 \n27 \n                                                           \n12 http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/Statutes/TITLE42/42-12.3/42-12.3-3.HTM.   \n28 \n  43   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 44 of 68\n \n1  Moreover, Rhode Island state insurance law does not eliminate cost-sharing for contraceptive \n2  drugs and devices and services related thereto.    \n3  170.  Soon, Rhode Island state insurance laws will go beyond the federal guarantee by \n4  requiring, beginning on the first day of each plan year after April 1, 2019, every health insurance \n5  issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage that covers prescription \n6  contraception may not restrict reimbursement for dispensing a covered prescription contraceptive \n7  up to 365 days at a time.  R.I. GEN. LAWS § 27-19-76; R.I. GEN. LAWS § 27-18-84; R.I. GEN. \n8  LAWS §§ 27-20-43(e) and 27-20-72; R.I. GEN. LAWS §§ 27-41-59(e) and 27-41-89.   \n9    171.  Rhode Island law does not cover women and covered dependents who have coverage \n10  through an employer that uses a self-insured plan.  As of April 2018, there were at least 192,368 \n11  Rhode Islanders covered through self-insured employer groups.   \n12  172.  There are at least two Rhode Island employers, with 4,543 employees, which will \n13  likely exempt themselves. \n14  173.  Rhode Island does not have a state law that matches the federal guarantees provided \n15  by the Affordable Care Act (Public Health Service Act 2713(c)).  For example, although Rhode \n16  Island’s statute covers prescription contraceptive methods, it does not prohibit cost sharing. \n17  Women in Rhode Island are at risk of losing Affordable Care Act required contraceptive coverage \n18  under the final regulations issued by the federal government.  Forty-four (44%) of pregnancies in \n19  Rhode Island are unintended.  71,320 women are in need of publicly funded contraceptive \n20  services in Rhode Island.  The percentage of need met by Title X clinics and publicly supported \n21  providers in Rhode Island is currently only 35%.  \n22  174.  As a result of these Exemption Rules, Rhode Island women will either (a) utilize and \n23  seek coverage through the Title X Family Planning Program or (b) they will forgo coverage and \n24  experience an unintended pregnancy.  In both scenarios, the State will suffer increased costs and \n25  its residents will be harmed. \n26  VERMONT \n27  175.  As a result of these Exemption Rules, Rhode Island women will either (a) utilize and \n28  seek coverage through \n  44   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 45 of 68\n \n1  176.  Approximately 113,500 women in Vermont are between ages 15 and 44.  \n2  Approximately 26,000 women of child-bearing age risk losing some or all of their contraception \n3  coverage as a result of the new regulations. This is likely an underestimate of the women who \n4  could be affected, as reporting of ERISA plans to the state database monitoring these numbers is \n5  voluntary. \n6  177.  Vermont has a law entitled “Reproductive Health Equity in Health Insurance \n7  Coverage,” Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 8, § 4099c.  The law requires health insurance plans to cover all \n8  FDA-approved prescription contraceptives and devices if the plan covers any prescription drugs. \n9  Vermont’s law further requires contraceptive coverage to be on the same terms as treatment and \n10  prescriptions for other conditions.  Vermont also requires that health insurance plans provide “at \n11  least one drug, device, or other product within each [FDA-approved] method of contraception for \n12  women” at no cost. As in other states, Vermont’s law cannot be enforced against employer self-\n13  funded plans, which are governed by ERISA. There are at least two Vermont employers, with \n14  2,278 employees, which will likely exempt themselves. \n15  178.  For Vermont residents who are not currently pregnant and make less than 200% of \n16  the federal poverty line, Vermont has funded family planning services through the Medicaid \n17  Family Planning Initiative, also known as the Vermont Access Plan. See 13-170-001 Vt. Code R. \n18  § 9.03(g). Up to $2 million is allocated annually for the Vermont Access Plan, of which \n19  $1,075,800 comes from the federal Medical Assistance Program, and the remainder comes from \n20  Vermont’s Global Commitment funds. Global Commitment funds are 46.21% funded by the State \n21  of Vermont. \n22  179.  Vermont relies on Planned Parenthood of Northern New England (PPNNE), a \n23  501(c)(3) organization, to provide a significant amount of publicly-funded reproductive health \n24  services, particularly for low-income and rural Vermonters. Planned Parenthood administers all \n25  services under the Vermont Access Plan as well as all Title X services in Vermont. When patients \n26  are uninsured and unable to pay, Planned Parenthood provides services on a sliding fee scale. \n27  Planned Parenthood operates its 12 clinics statewide in Vermont, mostly in medically \n28  underserved areas. If more Vermonters lose contraceptive coverage, Planned Parenthood may be \n  45   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 46 of 68\n \n1  their only option for affordable contraception. But Planned Parenthood will need additional \n2  resources to expand services to this population. For those who qualify for the Vermont Access \n3  Plan, that money will come in part from the State of Vermont. \n4  180.  Some patients in Vermont will stop using contraception, or use a less reliable form of \n5  contraception, as a result of losing coverage. As a result, the number of unintended pregnancies in \n6  Vermont will increase. In 2010, the most recent year for which data is available, 73.5% of \n7  unplanned births were publicly funded in Vermont, for a total cost of $31.4 million. Of that \n8  amount, $21.8 million came from the federal government, and $9.6 million came from the State \n9  of Vermont. And those are only the public costs for unplanned pregnancies resulting in births. In \n10  2014, 44% of unwanted pregnancies ended in abortions in Vermont. The cost to the State of \n11  Vermont for publicly-funded abortions in 2010 was $402 per abortion. No federal funding is \n12  available to offset the cost of abortions. \n13  181.  Unintended pregnancies also have significant long-term social and economic impacts \n14  on women and children, and therefore on the State of Vermont. In some cases, women and their \n15  dependents may become eligible for Medicaid as a result of an unintended pregnancy. Over all, \n16  Vermont’s Medicaid program is approximately 55% federal funding and 45% state funding. \n17  However, the “enhanced match” programs, like the Children’s Health Insurance Program, are \n18  90% federal funds and 10% state funds. To the extent that enrollment in Medicaid increases as a \n19  result of the increase in unintended pregnancies, that will also add to Vermont’s costs. \n20  182.  There are at least two Vermont employers, with 2,278 employees, which will likely \n21  exempt themselves. \n22  VIRGINIA \n23  183.  In Virginia, prior to the ACA, 54% of all pregnancies were unintended in 2010.  Of \n24  those unplanned pregnancies that resulted in births, 45.4% were publicly funded, costing Virginia \n25  $194.6 million on unintended pregnancies.   \n26  184.  In contrast to the other plaintiff States, Virginia does not have a state law \n27  Contraceptive Equity Act.  Accordingly, there is no general state-based legal framework to ensure \n28  that employers and insurers provide contraception coverage for women under self-funded health \n  46   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 47 of 68\n \n1  plans or state-regulated health plans.  The Contraception Exemption Rules will therefore have an \n2  even broader impact on the Commonwealth of Virginia directly, as well as on its population, \n3  because they could affect every women who obtains healthcare through her employer. \n4  185.  Of the almost two million women in Virginia between the ages of 15 and 49, 66% \n5  obtain their health insurance coverage from employer-sponsored plans.     \n6    186.  CoverVirginia’s Plan First is Virginia’s limited benefit family planning program that \n7  covers all birth control methods provided by a clinician and some birth control methods obtained \n8  with a prescription, such as contraceptive rings, patches, birth control pills, and diaphragms.  12 \n9  VAC 30-30-20.  Plan First also covers family planning and education services.   \n10  187.  Individuals are eligible for Plan First if they are not eligible for full benefits under \n11  Medicaid or the Family Access to Medical Insurance Security (FAMIS) Plan, are legally residing \n12  in Virginia, and meet certain income limits.  Even those with private insurance may nevertheless \n13  be eligible for Plan First.  \n14  188.  Plan First eligibility is set by income limits that are a function of family size and \n15  monthly income level.  In general, families with income below 200% of the applicable federal \n16  poverty guideline are eligible.  As of October 1, 2017, 115,895 individuals were enrolled in Plan \n17  First.  The total spent on Plan First in State Fiscal Year 2017 (July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017) \n18  was $7,142,414.   \n19  189.  Plan First providers include 1,185 physicians, 1,230 pharmacies, 67 hospitals, and \n20  hundreds of other providers, such as clinics.  Two of the top five providers of Plan First services \n21  are the University of Virginia Hospital and the Medical College of Virginia Hospital, both part of \n22  state-supported health systems.  \n23  190.  Because eligible women denied no-cost coverage from employers and/or insurers \n24  exploiting the “moral” or “religious” exceptions of the Contraception Exemption Rules will likely \n25  seek access to state funded alternatives, Virginia will be fiscally impacted through increased \n26  enrollment in Plan First. \n27  191.  Additionally, state providers, such as the Medical College of Virginia Hospital and \n28  the University of Virginia Hospital, do not recover 100% of the cost of the care they provide \n  47   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 48 of 68\n \n1  under Plan First.  Accordingly, an increase in women seeking services from these two hospital \n2  systems under Plan First will have an additional impact on Virginia’s financial obligations \n3  through the institutions themselves. \n4  192.  In 2016, the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) served 47,869 family planning \n5  clients, of which 30.2% were insured and 69.8% were uninsured.  According to VDH, the state \n6  has approximately 19,000 teen pregnancies, 9,500 unintended pregnancies, and 20,000 abortions \n7  annually. \n8  193.  In 2015, there were 135 Title X-funded sites in Virginia.  These sites delivered \n9  contraceptive care to 70,320 women in Virginia.  These Title X sites have a finite budget and will \n10  be unable to meet the additional demand for services, as a result of the increase in the patient \n11  population due to the Contraception Exemption Rules, without a significant increase in funding.  \n12  WASHINGTON \n13  194.  More than 2.4 million women in Washington are of child-bearing age.  Up to 746,200 \n14  women of child-bearing age in Washington State face losing contraception coverage entirely as a \n15  result of the Administration’s new regulations, and others face losing no-cost contraceptive \n16  coverage.  \n17  195.  Washington has a Contraceptive Parity Rule that requires health plans that offer \n18  coverage of prescription drugs or devices to provide equal coverage for prescription \n19  contraceptives.  WAC 284-43-5150.  This Rule, however, does not require contraception to be \n20  covered without cost-sharing, and it cannot be enforced against employer self-funded insurance \n21  plans, which are governed by ERISA. \n22  196.  At least one employer doing business in Washington State that would have been \n23  subject to the contraceptive coverage and accommodation process prior to October 7, 2017, has \n24  informed the State that it is taking the position that it is exempt from that requirement now. \n25  Another employer doing business in Washington State announced to its Washington employees \n26  on October 27, 2017 that as a result of “recent changes to the ACA rules” by the Federal \n27  Government, the “accommodation is no longer” available to its employees.  These statements are \n28  indicative of positions likely held by other employers and colleges doing business in Washington \n  48   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 49 of 68\n \n1  State.  Nationally, at least 60% of all covered employees are enrolled in employers’ self-funded \n2  insurance plans.  In Washington State in 2016, 57.4% of covered employees were enrolled in self-\n3  funded insurance plans. \n4  197.  The IFRs and the Exemption Rules will increase the costs borne by the State as \n5  residents who lose coverage for contraception through their employer or college seek coverage \n6  through State-subsidized programs which provide subsidized contraceptive coverage, including \n7  Apple Health, Washington’s Medicaid program.  The Departments acknowledge that many \n8  women who lose coverage as a result of the IFRs will receive “free or subsidized care” through \n9  state programs.   \n10  198.  Apple Health is administered by a Washington state agency, the Washington Health \n11  Care Authority, and is funded in significant part by the State of Washington. \n12  199.  Apple Health provides integrated health care services that promote health, wellbeing, \n13  and quality of life for almost 1.8 million Washington residents.  As part of that mission, Apple \n14  Health provides coverage for reproductive health services including family planning and \n15  pregnancy related services for eligible Washington residents through a variety of programs. \n16  Family planning services include all FDA-approved contraceptive methods and the clinical \n17  services necessary for clients to safely and effectively use their chosen contraceptive method. \n18  200.  Apple Health serves as a secondary-payor for thousands of people in Washington \n19  who have primary insurance through their employer or institution of higher education (or through \n20  their spouse’s or parents’ insurance).  Eligibility for Apple Health is based on several factors, \n21  including age, household size, tax filing status, pregnancy status, and income.  For example, \n22  childless adults are generally eligible for Apple Health at up to 133% of the Federal Poverty \n23  Level, but pregnant women are generally eligible at up to 193%.  Individuals up to age 19 are \n24  eligible up to 312% of the Federal Poverty Level. Individuals at up to 260% of the Federal \n25  Poverty Level may be qualified for family planning services through an Apple Health program. \n26  201.  Apple Health serves as a secondary payor for services not otherwise fully covered by \n27  employer or higher education sponsored health plans for those clients that have both primary \n28  health coverage and Apple Health coverage.  In 2016, the Health Care Authority provided \n  49   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 50 of 68\n \n1  secondary Apple Health coverage for 120,328 clients who had primary health coverage from \n2  other sources, including employer-sponsored coverage and student coverage.  Of the total Apple \n3  Health clients that have primary health coverage from sources other than Apple Health, 69,652 \n4  are women, 38,336 of which are ages 15-44. \n5  202.  There are also certain programs administered by the Washington State Health Care \n6  Authority that provide specific services for specific populations. For example, women and men \n7  up to 260% of the Federal Poverty Level may be eligible to receive family planning services from \n8  a family planning services only program that is part of Apple Health.  \n9  203.  There are at least seven Washington employers, with 17,239 employees, which will \n10  likely exempt themselves. \n11  II.  PRIOR REGULATORY FRAMEWORK IMPLEMENTING ACA CONTRACEPTIVE-\nCOVERAGE REQUIREMENT AND PROTECTING RELIGIOUS EXERCISE \n12 \n204.  In implementing the ACA, HHS contemplated laws protecting religious exercise.  To \n13 \nthat end, although the ACA requires coverage of women’s preventive healthcare, the regulations \n14 \nprovided adequate protections for certain employers that objected to providing their female \n15 \nemployees with contraceptive coverage based on their religious beliefs.  The two exceptions \n16 \noriginally implemented were for: (1) religious organizations and (2) nonprofits with religious \n17 \nobjections.  The regulations permitted religious employers such as churches to seek an \n18 \n“exemption” from the contraceptive-coverage requirement.  See 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a) (HHS \n19 \nregulation).  The agencies explained that this exemption was meant to apply to houses of worship, \n20 \nwhere it would be reasonable to presume that line-level employees would share their employer’s \n21 \nreligious objection to contraception.  77 Fed. Reg. 8,728 (Feb. 15, 2012).13  The agencies declined \n22 \nto implement a broader exemption out of concern that it might sweep in employers “more likely \n23 \nto employ individuals who have no religious objection to the use of contraceptive services,” and \n24 \n25 \n                                                           \n13 “Religious employer” was defined as: “(1) Has the inculcation of religious values as its \n26  purpose; (2) primarily employs persons who share its religious tenets; (3) primarily serves \npersons who share its religious tenets; and (4) is a non-profit organization [under the relevant \n27  statutes, which] refer[] to churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and conventions or associations of \nchurches, as well as to the exclusively religious activities of any religious order.” Id. at 8,726. \n28 \n  50   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 51 of 68\n \n1  thereby risk “subject[ing] [such] employees to the religious views of [their] employer.”  Id.  \n2  Nonprofits with religious objections were also allowed to opt out of the contraceptive-coverage \n3  requirement via an “accommodation,” by which the nonprofit employer certifies its objection and \n4  the insurer is then responsible for separate contraceptive coverage.   \n5  205.  This exemption process mirrored the Internal Revenue Service rules with respect to \n6  religious exemptions.  Indeed, the law routinely draws distinctions between houses of worship \n7  and nonchurch nonprofits (including religious ones), because of the First Amendment’s special \n8  solicitude toward ecclesiastical authorities.  Cf., e.g., 2 U.S.C. § 1602(8)(B)(xviii) (exempting \n9  churches from Lobbying Disclosure Act’s registration requirements); 26 U.S.C. § \n10  6033(a)(3)(A)(i), (iii) (exempting churches from obligations for nonprofits to register with \n11  Internal Revenue Service and to submit annual informational tax filings); 29 U.S.C. § 1003(b)(2) \n12  (exempting church plans from ERISA). \n13  206.  Following three rounds of notice-and-comment rule making to develop and refine the \n14  accommodation regulations, which generated hundreds of thousands of public comments, the \n15  federal government enacted the “accommodation” process, which furthers the government’s \n16  compelling interest in ensuring that women covered by every type of health plan receive full and \n17  equal health coverage, including contraceptive coverage, while safeguarding the religious rights \n18  of specific employers. \n19  207.  This accommodation process resulted in a relatively seamless mechanism for women \n20  whose employers obtained the religious accommodation to continue to receive their ACA-\n21  guaranteed contraceptive coverage and helped the government ensure that no woman went \n22  without birth control as a result.  See 80 Fed. Reg. 41318 (July 14, 2015) (prior regulation); 45 \n23  C.F.R. § 147.131(c)-(d) (prior regulation).  This scheme ensured that those employees would not \n24  be adversely affected by their employers’ decision to opt out.  45 C.F.R. § 147.131(c)-(d).  At the \n25  same time, it ensured that certain employers who had religious objections could avoid providing \n26  or paying for this coverage.  Thus, this scheme struck a good balance for both the employer and \n27  the employee. \n28 \n  51   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 52 of 68\n \n1  208.  The religious accommodation was later expanded to include certain closely held for-\n2  profit organizations with religious objections to providing contraceptive care, consistent with the \n3  Supreme Court’s decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2751 (2014); 80 \n4  Fed. Reg. 41318 (July 14, 2015); 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(b)(4).  Further, in response to the Supreme \n5  Court’s decision, an organization could use an alternative process of providing notice of its \n6  religious objections to providing for contraceptive coverage.  Instead of filing a form with HHS \n7  or sending a copy of the executed form to its health insurance provider or third party \n8  administrator, the nonprofit organization could simply notify HHS in writing of its objection to \n9  covering contraceptive coverage.  Wheaton College v. Burwell, 134 S. Ct. 2806 (2014); 80 FR \n10  41318. \n11  209.  Eight circuits have concluded that the religious accommodation process did not \n12  impose a substantial burden on religious exercise under the Religious Freedom and Restoration \n13  Act (RFRA).  Rather, these courts concluded that the accommodation carefully balanced the \n14  government’s compelling government interest with an employer’s religious beliefs.14   \n15  // \n16  // \n17 \n18 \n                                                           \n14 See Priests for Life v.

NEW REGULATORY FRAMEWORK ILLEGALLY EXPANDS THE ABILITY OF \nEMPLOYERS TO OPT OUT OF PROVIDING COST-FREE CONTRACEPTIVE COVERAGE \n2  UNDER THE ACA \n3 \n210.  Without any notice, opportunity to comment, or evidence-based expert guidance, on \n4 \nOctober 6, 2017, Defendants promulgated sweeping new IFRs impeding women’s access to cost-\n5 \nfree coverage as required by the ACA. \n6 \n211.  Prior to promulgating the IFRs, Defendants failed to meet or convene publically with \n7 \nhealthcare advocates such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Association of \n8 \nFamily Physicians, the American College of Physicians, the National Association of Nurse \n9 \nPractitioners in Women’s Health, the National Partnership for Women and Families, or the \n10 \nPlanned Parenthood Federation of America, among others.   \n11 \n212.  Rather, these and other stakeholders were forced to provide input after issuance of the \n12 \nIFRs: \n13 \n The American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of Obstetricians and \n14 \nGynecologists, and Physicians for Reproductive Health urged that the Departments \n15 \ncontinue their commitment to ensuring that women receive contraceptive coverage \n16 \nwithout cost-sharing by conducting enforcement and oversight and continuing seamless \n17  coverage via the accommodation process.15   \n18 \n The American College of Physicians warned that decreased access to contraception, an \n19 \nintegral part of preventive care and a medical necessity for women during approximately \n20 \n30 years of their lives, would have damaging effects on public health.  It warned that \n21 \nallowing employers to selectively opt out of certain benefits based on their own personal \n22 \nor moral beliefs without accommodation, could result in patients not being able to receive \n23  appropriate medical care as recommended by their physician.16 \n24 \n25 \n                                                           \n15 Available at https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=CMS-2014-0115-13264 and \n26  https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=CMS-2017-0133-43813, see also \nhttps://www.regulations.gov/document?D=CMS-2017-0133-42504.   \n27  16 Available at https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=CMS-2014-0115-56330 and \nhttps://www.regulations.gov/document?D=CMS-2017-0133-43827. \n28 \n  53   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 54 of 68\n \n1  135.  Several comments also highlighted the negative impacts the IFRs would have on the \n2  interests of the States: \n3   The plaintiffs California, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, \n4  Minnesota, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington, accompanied \n5  by Maine, Massachusetts, Oregon, and Pennsylvania explained that the IFRs violated the \n6  Establishment Clause and Equal Protection Clause, and would result in significant harm to \n7  women and children, and the public health in general, as well as cause financial and \n8  administrative burdens to the States.17 \n9   The California Insurance Commissioner, who oversees the nation’s largest insurance \n10  market, warned that extending the exemption to health insurers, none of which have sued \n11  for relief from the mandate under RFRA or otherwise, invites them to decline to cover \n12  contraceptives for financial reasons, especially because the IFRs do not include a \n13  requirement for exempted entities to take any action to establish that they legitimately \n14  object to covering some or all contraceptive methods on religious or moral grounds; thus \n15  seriously impairing state-based regulation in an area in which state law is not preempted \n16  and also increasing administrative burdens on regulators responding to insurer actions \n17  based on inconsistent federal laws.18 \n18   The County of Santa Clara in California, the owner and operator of the Santa Clara Valley \n19  Medical Center and a provider for California’s Family PACT Program, noted that the \n20  IFRs would burden the county as a safety-net provider as reimbursements paid to such \n21  providers do not cover the full costs of providing these services.19  \n22   Administrators of the Title X programs in California (Essential Access Health) and in New \n23  York (Public Health Solutions) objected to the Departments’ assertion that existing \n24  government-sponsored programs, such as Medicaid and Title X, could serve as \n                                                           \n25  17 Available at https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=CMS-2014-0115-58168 and \nhttps://www.regulations.gov/document?D=CMS-2017-0133-44024.   \n26  18 https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=CMS-2014-0115-56370 and \nhttps://www.regulations.gov/document?D=CMS-2017-0133-43987.   \n27  19 Available at https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=CMS-2014-0115-58259 and \nhttps://www.regulations.gov/document?D=CMS-2017-0133-44134. \n28 \n  54   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 55 of 68\n \n1  alternatives for individuals who lose contraceptive coverage as a result of the IFRs.  These \n2  administrators noted that these programs are already stretched, were not designed as a \n3  substitute for employer-sponsored coverage, and many patients losing such care may not \n4  be income- or otherwise eligible for these safety net programs.20   \n5   The City of New York, with the benefit of the experience and expertise from its Human \n6  Resources Administration and the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, warned that \n7  the expansion of the religious exemption and creation of a moral exemption would be \n8  harmful to the health of women because it would result in bureaucratic and financial \n9  hurdles that would impede women’s ability to access contraception.21 \n10   The State of New York, Department of Financial Services, cautioned that the IFRs would \n11  jeopardize the health of women and foster situations where this essential preventive \n12  service is not provided.22 \n13  213.  On November 15, 2018, despite the pending litigation, the Defendants published the \n14  Contraception Exemption Rules, which will supersede the IFRs.   \n15  214.  The Exemption Rules vastly expand the scope of entities who will exempt themselves \n16  from the contraceptive-coverage requirement.  Once effective, virtually any employer or \n17  individual or insurer, regardless of corporate structure or religious affiliation, can exempt \n18  themselves from the requirement.  Further, once effective, virtually any employer, individual, or \n19  insurer can exempt themselves not only because of a religious objection, but also because of a \n20  moral objection—a newly created category.  Potentially exempt entities now include church-\n21  integrated auxiliaries; religious orders with religious objections; nonprofit organizations with \n22  religious or moral objections; for-profit entities that are not publicly traded, with religious or \n23 \n                                                           \n20 Available at https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=CMS-2014-0115-57961, \n24  https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=CMS-2017-0133-43738, \nhttps://www.regulations.gov/document?D=CMS-2014-0115-13205, \n25  https://www.regulations.gov/docketBrowser?rpp=25&po=0&s=public%2Bhealth%2Bsolutions&\ndct=PS&D=CMS-2014-0115&refD=CMS-2014-0115-13773, and \n26  https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=CMS-2017-0133-42433.   \n21 Available at https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=CMS-2014-0115-56218 and \n27  https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=CMS-2017-0133-43808.   \n22 https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=CMS-2017-0133-43549.   \n28 \n  55   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 56 of 68\n \n1  moral objections; for-profit entities that are publicly traded, with religious objections; other non-\n2  governmental employers with religious objections; non-governmental institutions of higher \n3  education with religious or moral objections; and insurers with religious or moral objections, to \n4  the extent they provide coverage to a plan sponsor or individual that is also exempt.   \n5  215.  The Exemption Rules thus expand the Hobby Lobby decision to nearly any business, \n6  nonprofit or for-profit, with a religious or moral objection to providing women access to \n7  contraceptive coverage, further frustrating the scheme and purpose of the ACA.  There is no \n8  justification for such a broad expansion.  As the Defendants readily admit, they are not aware of \n9  any publicly traded entities that have objected to providing contraceptive coverage on the basis of \n10  a religious or moral belief.  Nevertheless, the Exemption Rules now make it easy for such entities \n11  to obtain an exemption for any reason, including economic, because there is no notice required \n12  and no oversight by the Defendants. \n13  216.  Additionally, under the Exemption Rules, employers exempting themselves from \n14  having to provide contraceptive coverage do not need to certify their objection to the coverage \n15  requirement.  Rather, the employer can simply inform their employees they will no longer cover \n16  contraceptive benefits and counseling as part of their employer healthcare coverage.  This is a \n17  significant change.  By contrast, the prior federal regulations provided a notification process so \n18  that women would be informed of their employers’ decision to opt out and that they would \n19  receive contraceptive coverage through the religious accommodation process.  This process \n20  ensured that employers who had a religious objection to providing this coverage did not have to \n21  facilitate the provision of contraceptives, but that women would receive the required coverage.  \n22  The government thereby ensured that there was a balance between the compelling interest that \n23  women have access to their federally entitled benefit under the ACA, while also accommodating \n24  those employers who sought not to provide this coverage.  The Exemption Rules no longer \n25  require the accommodation, thereby eliminating the federally entitled benefit for women whose \n26  employers deem themselves exempt. \n27  217.  As previously indicated, the Exemption Rules create an entirely new “moral \n28  exemption,” which was not previously contemplated by the federal government or the \n  56   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 57 of 68\n \n1  public.  The moral exemption is overly broad and includes few boundaries or clear definitions. \n2  Moral convictions are defined as convictions (1) that a person “deeply and sincerely holds;” (2) \n3  “that are purely ethical or moral in source and content;” (3) “but that nevertheless impose … a \n4  duty;” (4) and that “certainly occupy … a place parallel to that filled by … God in traditionally \n5  religious persons,” such that one could say the “beliefs function as a religion.”  Employers can \n6  now simply make use of the new vague moral exemption, without informing the federal \n7  government.  Thus, a whole new universe of employers can avail themselves of this moral \n8  exemption without an accommodation to the employees to ensure the seamless contraceptive \n9  coverage envisioned by the ACA, thereby vastly expanding the number of women who will lose \n10  access to care through their employer-sponsored coverage.  The States will be forced to fill this \n11  gap.   \n12  218.  In seeking to demonstrate that women will not be harmed, the rules suggest that \n13  women seek out contraceptive coverage through federal Title X family planning clinics; however, \n14  the Title X program simply cannot replicate or replace the seamless contraceptive-coverage \n15  requirement because it lacks the capacity.  The Title X program is a safety-net program designed \n16  for low-income populations and is subject to discretionary funding by Congress.  Indeed, from \n17  2010-2014, even as the number of women in need of publicly funded contraceptive care grew by \n18  5%, representing an additional 1 million women in need, Congress cut funding for Title X by \n19  10%.  And a 2017 White House memorandum suggested cutting funding by 50%.  Currently, the \n20  Title X program only serves 1/5 of the nationwide need for publicly funded contraceptive care.   \n21  219.  Moreover, such a suggestion by the federal defendants demonstrates that the rules \n22  require women to take additional steps—outside of their employer-sponsored coverage—to \n23  access necessary care.  As such, the rules do not erase the threat inflicted by the rules; they \n24  compound the injury and expect the States to pick up the costs.   \n25  220.  The federal government also recently promulgated a proposed rule that, if finalized, \n26  would severely undermine the Title X family planning program, restricting access to affordable, \n27  life-saving reproductive healthcare.  See 83 Fed. Reg. 25502 (June 1, 2018) (Proposed Rule).  The \n28  Proposed Rule seeks to create barriers to access to women’s healthcare.  Among other things, it \n  57   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 58 of 68\n \n1  eliminates nondirective options counseling and gags all Title X providers by requiring that they \n2  steer all pregnant women towards prenatal care and social services, regardless of a patient’s \n3  choice.  This undermines the provider-patient relationship trust.  The Proposed Rule also \n4  undermines the standard of care by allowing Title X providers to refuse to provide medically \n5  approved contraceptive methods, in favor of less effective methods such as abstinence only and \n6  eliminates the “evidence-based” requirement that had previously been in effect.23 \n7  221.  The Title X Proposed Rule, if finalized, will force Title X recipients into an untenable \n8  position of deciding whether to accept program funds with mandates that restrict access to care \n9  and force a gag on clinics, or forfeit Title X funding altogether, leaving gaps in access to family \n10  planning care that the Title X program was first established to fill.  The former scenario will \n11  result in the invasion of the physician-patient relationship, the trampling of the constitutional \n12  rights of patients and providers, the transmission of incomplete, misleading, and medically \n13  dangerous information to women, and the frustration of the right to make an informed, \n14  independent decision as to whether to terminate a pregnancy.  The latter scenario will reduce \n15  funding available to crucial family planning providers, thereby reducing critical healthcare \n16  services available to vulnerable populations.  Either decision will lead to serious public health \n17  threats, increased risk of unintended pregnancies, and gaps in care.   \n18  222.  In short, under the Contraception Exemption Rules, entities exempting themselves do \n19  not need to certify to the federal government any objection to the contraceptive-coverage \n20  requirement, which all but ensures that women across the country will go without coverage for \n21  birth control access in contravention of the ACA.  It further ensures that the federal government \n22  will not review the legitimacy of the religious or moral exemption, thereby inviting rampant \n23  abuse.  It appears inevitable that endless numbers of employers will simply opt out without \n24  consequence. \n25  223.  The Defendants calculated the extent of harm that will be caused by the Exemption \n26  Rules by reviewing those employers who had previously sought an accommodation.  The \n                                                           \n27  23 See Comment Letter of California, et al., available at \nhttps://www.regulations.gov/document?D=HHS-OS-2018-0008-161828.  \n28 \n  58   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 59 of 68\n \n1  spreadsheets used by the Departments to make these calculations were provided to this Court as \n2  part of the administrative record.  In the spreadsheets, the Defendants identify at least one \n3  employer, Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. with employees in Virginia, California, Maryland, New \n4  York, and Washington, that it expects will use the expanded exemptions, and which has a self-\n5  insured plan.24 \n6  224.  There are at least 10 Virginia employers, with 3,853 employees, who will likely \n7  exempt themselves.  Thus, an unknown but considerable number of Virginia women will be \n8  affected by the Exemption Rules, and Virginia anticipates that this number will vastly expand, \n9  eliminating the ability of these women to access cost-free contraceptive coverage through their \n10  health plan.  Consequently, they will turn to publicly funded clinics or Virginia’s wrap-around \n11  family program, Plan First, to obtain the contraceptive coverage that is no longer being provided \n12  by employers or insurers, or being tracked by the federal government to ensure women maintain \n13  access as envisioned by the ACA. \n14  225.  The Contraception Exemption Rules could impact millions of Californians who \n15  receive their healthcare through a self-insured employer health plans and therefore do not receive \n16  the benefit of California’s Contraceptive Equity Act. \n17  226.  There are at least 25 California employers, with 54,879 employees, who will likely \n18  exempt themselves.  Thus, an unknown but substantial number of California women will be \n19  affected by the Exemption Rules, and California anticipates that this number will vastly expand, \n20  eliminating the ability of these women to access cost-free contraceptive coverage through their \n21  health plan.  Consequently, they will turn to publicly funded clinics or California’s wrap-around \n22  family program, Family PACT, to obtain the contraceptive coverage that is no longer being \n23  provided by employers or insurers, or being tracked by the federal government to ensure women \n24  maintain access as envisioned by the ACA. \n25  227.  One California-based employer is permissive defendant-intervenor Little Sisters of \n26  the Poor, which moved to intervene on the grounds that it intended to use the IFRs in California. \n                                                           \n27  24 Hobby Lobby disclosed during litigation with the Defendants that it self-funds its health \ncoverage.  Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v. Sebelius, 723 F.3d 1114, 1124 (10th Cir. 2013). \n28 \n  59   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 60 of 68\n \n1  ECF No. 38 at 1.  Specifically, Little Sisters represented to this Court that absent intervention, its \n2  ability to obtain an exemption was threatened.  Id. at 2, 8, 38.  In granting the Little Sisters’ \n3  motion to intervene, this Court relied on Little Sisters’ representations that they needed to be part \n4  of this litigation to ensure that their California-based entity could utilize the exemption.  ECF No. \n5  115 at 7-8. \n6  228.  There are at least five Maryland employers, with 6,460 employees, who will likely \n7  exempt themselves.  Thus, an unknown but substantial number of Maryland women will be \n8  affected by the Exemption Rules, and Maryland anticipates that this number will vastly expand, \n9  eliminating the ability of these women to access cost-free contraceptive coverage through their \n10  health plan.  Consequently, they will turn to publicly funded clinics or Maryland’s Title X \n11  Program or Medicaid Family Planning Program to obtain the contraceptive services no longer \n12  being provided by employers or insurers, or being tracked by the federal government to ensure \n13  women maintain access as envisioned by the ACA. \n14  229.  Based on publicly available data, the Exemption Rules could impact approximately \n15  1.16 million women in New York State who are currently covered by self-funded employer plans \n16  and thus subject to the vast reach of the Exemption Rules.   \n17  230.  There are also several employers in the State of New York that challenged the ACA’s \n18  contraception coverage mandate and accommodation provisions in court.  Hobby Lobby Stores, \n19  Inc., the lead plaintiff in the Supreme Court case challenging the contraception mandate, Burwell \n20  v. Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct., 2751 (2014), is a for-profit national arts and crafts store chain, which \n21  has twelve store locations and approximately 600 employees in New York.   \n22  231.  Upon information and belief, these entities would likely avail themselves of the broad \n23  exemption criteria under the Exemption Rules, and not provide their substantial number of \n24  employees and students insurance plans with contraceptive care coverage. \n25  232.  The religious Exemption Rule itself estimates that hundreds of thousands of women \n26  will be harmed.  The religious Exemption Rule concludes that between 70,500 – 126,400 women \n27  will be harmed nationally.  Based on the calculations in the Exemption Rules, approximately:  \n28   8,900 – 16,000 women in California will be harmed; \n  60   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 61 of 68\n \n1   800 – 1,500 women in Connecticut will be harmed; \n2   200 – 400 women in Delaware will be harmed;  \n3   200 – 400 women in the District of Columbia will be harmed;  \n4   300 – 600 women in Hawaii will be harmed;  \n5   3,000 – 6,000 women in Illinois will be harmed;  \n6   1,300 – 2,700 women in Maryland will be harmed;  \n7   1,200 – 2,500 women in Minnesota will be harmed;  \n8   4,600 – 7,900 women in New York will be harmed;  \n9   2,200 – 4,000 women in North Carolina will be harmed;  \n10   200 – 500 women in Rhode Island will be harmed;  \n11   100 – 300 women in Vermont will be harmed;  \n12   1,900 – 3,500 women in Virginia will be harmed; and, \n13   1,500 – 2,900 women in Washington will be harmed.  \n14  233.  Though recognizing that women will be harmed, the Defendants seek to downplay \n15  the impact of this harm by suggesting these women could simply utilize federal Title X clinics.  \n16  However, as noted supra, such a solution only demonstrates that women will no longer have \n17  access to seamless coverage as they are required to seek essential healthcare outside their \n18  employer-sponsored plan.  Furthermore, such clinics lack the capacity to accommodate an \n19  entirely new patient population.  \n20  234.  By promulgating the Contraception Exemption Rules, the States’ concrete interest in \n21  ensuring access to contraceptive coverage is violated. \n22  FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n23  (Violation of APA; 5 U.S.C. § 553) \n24  235.  Paragraphs 1 through 234 are realleged and incorporated herein by reference. \n25  236.  The APA generally requires agencies to provide the public notice and an opportunity \n26  to be heard before promulgating a regulation.  An agency wishing to promulgate a regulation \n27  must publish in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking that includes “(1) a \n28  statement of the time, place, and nature of public rule making proceedings; (2) reference to the \n  61   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 62 of 68\n \n1  legal authority under which the rule is proposed; and (3) either the terms or substance of the \n2  proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved.”  5 U.S.C. § 553(b).  After the \n3  notice has issued, “the agency shall give interested persons an opportunity to participate in the \n4  rulemaking through submission of written data, views, or arguments with or without opportunity \n5  for oral presentation.”  Id. § 553(c).  \n6  237.  In narrow circumstances, the APA exempts agencies from this notice and comment \n7  process where they can show “good cause” that the process would be either “impracticable, \n8  unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.”  Id. § 553(b)(B).  The burden is on the agency to \n9  demonstrate good cause, and courts have interpreted the exception narrowly.  See, e.g., Lake \n10  Carriers’ Ass’n v. EPA, 652 F.3d 1, 6 (D.C. Cir. 2011). \n11  238.  Defendants have not and cannot demonstrate good cause for failing to give any notice \n12  to the public or allowing for public comment prior to effectuating these new IFRs.  The Ninth \n13  Circuit confirmed that Defendants failed to demonstrate good cause in promulgating the IFRs.  \n14  California v. Azar, --F.3d -- , 2018 WL 6566752, at *9-13 (9th Cir. Dec. 13, 2018) (explaining \n15  that the agencies lacked good cause and statutory authority to bypass notice and comment).  \n16  239.  Notice and comment is particularly important in legally and factually complex \n17  circumstances like those presented here.  Notice and comment allows affected parties—including \n18  states—to explain the practical effects of a rule before it is implemented, and ensures that the \n19  agency proceeds in a fully informed manner, exploring alternative, less harmful approaches.  In \n20  the area of women’s health care, it is particularly important to have an adequate notice and \n21  comment given that women have been relying on this benefit since 2012. \n22  240.  Because Defendants failed to follow section 553’s notice and comment procedures in \n23  promulgating the IFRs, the IFRs are invalid.   \n24  SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n25  (Violation of APA; 5 U.S.C. § 553) \n26  241.  Paragraphs 1 through 240 are realleged and incorporated herein by reference. \n27  242.  The final Contraceptive Exemption Rules do not comply with the APA’s notice-and-\n28  comment requirement.   5 U.S.C. § 553(b).   \n  62   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 63 of 68\n \n1  243.  To the extent that the Defendants rely on the comments received in response to the \n2  IFRs, such a process is insufficient.  A “period for comments after promulgation cannot substitute \n3  for the prior notice and comment required by the APA.  If a period for comments after issuance of \n4  a rule could cure a violation of the APA’s requirements, an agency could negate at will the \n5  congressional decision that notice and an opportunity for comment must precede promulgation.”  \n6  Natural Resources Defense Council, Inv. v. EPA, 683 F.2d 752 (3rd Cir. 1982); Levesque v. \n7  Block, 723 F.2d 175 (1st Cir. 1983) (“Permitting the submission of views after the effective date \n8  is no substitute for the right of interested persons to make their views known to the agency in time \n9  to influence the rule in a meaningful way”). \n10  244.  Because Defendants failed to follow section 553’s notice and comment procedures, \n11  the final rules are invalid.   \n12  THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \n13  (Violation of APA; 5 U.S.C. § 706) \n14  245.  Paragraphs 1 through 244 are realleged and incorporated herein by reference. \n15  246.  The APA requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside” agency action that is \n16  “(A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; \n17  (B) contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity; (C) in excess of statutory \n18  jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.”  5 U.S.C. § 706 (2). \n19  247.  By promulgating the Exemption Rules, without proper factual or legal basis, \n20  Defendants have acted arbitrarily and capriciously, have abused their discretion, have acted \n21  otherwise not in accordance with law, have taken unconstitutional and unlawful action in \n22  violation of the APA, and have acted in excess of statutory jurisdiction and authority.  \n23  Defendants’ violation causes ongoing harm to the States and their residents. \n24  FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n25  (Violation of the Establishment Clause) \n26  248.  Paragraphs 1 through 247 are realleged and incorporated herein by reference. \n27  249.  The First Amendment provides that “Congress shall make no law respecting an \n28  establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.”  U.S. Const., amend. I.  “The \n  63   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 64 of 68\n \n1  clearest command of the Establishment Clause is that one religious denomination cannot be \n2  officially preferred over another.”  Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228, 244 (1982); see also \n3  McCreary County, Kentucky v. ACLU, 545 U.S. 844, 875 (2005) (“the government may not favor \n4  one religion over another, or religion over irreligion”).  \n5  250.  The Contraception Exemption Rules privilege religious beliefs over secular beliefs as \n6  a basis for obtaining exemptions under the ACA.  \n7  251.  In contrast, the prior regulations only allowed an exemption for churches and an \n8  accommodation for nonprofits and closely held for-profit companies with religious objections.  \n9  This was narrowly tailored to accommodate religious beliefs and still provide essential women’s \n10  healthcare services.  \n11  252.  By promulgating the Exemption Rules, Defendants have violated the Establishment \n12  Clause because the Exemption Rules do not have a secular legislative purpose, the primary effect \n13  advances religion, especially in that they place an undue burden on third parties – the women who \n14  seek birth control, and the Exemption Rules foster excessive government entanglement with \n15  religion. \n16  253.  The Exemption Rules also ignore the compelling interest of seamless access to cost-\n17  free birth control.  This crosses the line from acceptable accommodation to religious \n18  endorsement.  Further, the Exemption Rules essentially coerce employees to participate in or \n19  support the religion of their employer. \n20  254.  Defendants’ violation causes ongoing harm to the States and their residents.   \n21  FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n22  (Violation of the Equal Protection Clause) \n23  255.  Paragraphs 1 through 254 are realleged and incorporated herein by reference. \n24  256.  The Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibits the federal \n25  government from denying equal protection of the laws.  \n26  257.  The IFRs and the Contraception Exemption Rules specifically target and harm \n27  women.  The ACA contemplated disparities in healthcare costs between women and men, and \n28  some of these disparities were rectified by the cost-free preventive services provided to women.  \n  64   \nSecond Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (4:17-cv-05783-HSG) \n   \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 170   Filed 12/18/18   Page 65 of 68\n \n1  The expansive exemptions created by the Exemption Rules undermine this action and adversely \n2  target and are discriminatory to women. \n3  258.  The IFRs and the Exemption Rules, together with statements made by Defendants \n4  concerning their intent and application, target individuals for discriminatory treatment based on \n5  their gender, without lawful justification. \n6  259.  By promulgating the IFRs and the Exemption Rules, Defendants have violated the \n7  equal protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. \n8  260.  Defendants’ violation causes ongoing harm to the States and their residents. \n9  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n10  WHEREFORE, the States respectfully request that this Court: \n11  1.  Issue a declaratory judgment that the IFRs and the Exemption Rules were not \n12  promulgated in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act; \n13  2.  Issue a declaratory judgment that the IFRs and the Exemption Rules are arbitrary and \n14  capricious, not in accordance with law, and Defendants acted in excess of statutory authority in \n15  promulgating them; \n16  3.  Issue a declaratory judgment that the IFRs and the Exemption Rules violate the \n17  Establishment Clause; \n18  4.  Issue a declaratory judgment that the IFRs and the Exemption Rules violate the Equal \n19  Protection Clause; \n20  5.  Issue a preliminary injunction prohibiting the implementation of the IFRs and the \n21  Exemption Rules; \n22  6.

Graber, Circuit \nJudges. \n \nOpinion by Judge Wallace \n \nWALLACE, Circuit Judge: \nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the regulations implementing it require \ngroup health plans to cover contraceptive care without cost sharing.  Federal \nagencies issued two interim final rules (IFRs) exempting employers with religious \nand moral objections from this requirement.  Several states sued to enjoin the \nenforcement of the IFRs, and the district court issued a nationwide preliminary \n   3     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 4 4 o of f4 488\ninjunction.  We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1292, and we affirm in part, \nvacate in part, and remand. \nI. \nA. \nTo contextualize the issues raised on appeal, we briefly recount the history \nof the ACA’s contraceptive coverage requirement.  The ACA provides that: \na group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or \nindividual  health  insurance  coverage  shall,  at  a  minimum  provide \ncoverage for and shall not impose any cost sharing requirements for . . . \nwith respect to women, such additional preventive care and screenings \n. . . as provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the \nHealth Resources and Services Administration [HRSA] . . . . \n \n42 U.S.C. § 300gg–13(a)(4).  HRSA established guidelines for women’s \npreventive services that include any “[FDA] approved contraceptive methods, \nsterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling.”  Group Health \nPlans and Health Insurance Issuers Relating to Coverage of Preventive Services \nUnder the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 77 Fed. Reg. 8,725-01, \n8,725 (Feb. 15, 2012).  The three agencies responsible for implementing the \nACA—the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Labor, \nand the Department of the Treasury (collectively, agencies)—issued regulations \nrequiring coverage of all preventive services contained in HRSA’s guidelines.  See, \ne.g., 45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(1)(iv) (DHSS regulation). \n  The agencies also recognized that religious organizations may object to the \n   4     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 5 5 o of f4 488\nuse of contraceptive care and offering health insurance that covers such care.  For \nthose organizations, the agencies provided two avenues.  First, group health plans \nof certain religious employers, such as churches, are categorically exempt from the \ncontraceptive coverage requirement.  Coverage of Certain Preventive Services \nUnder the Affordable Care Act, 78 Fed. Reg. 39,870, 39,874 (July 2, 2013).  \nSecond, nonprofit “eligible organizations” that are not categorically exempt can \nopt out of having to “contract, arrange, pay, or refer for contraceptive coverage.”  \nId.  To be eligible, the organization must file a self-certification form stating (1) \nthat it “opposes providing coverage for some or all of any contraceptive services \nrequired to be covered under [the regulation] on account of religious objections,” \n(2) that it “is organized and operates as a nonprofit entity,” and (3) that it “holds \nitself out as a religious organization.”  Id. at 39,892.  The organization sends a \ncopy of the form to its insurance provider, which must then provide contraceptive \ncoverage for the organization’s employees and cannot impose any charges related \nto the coverage.  Id. at 39,876.  The regulations refer to this second avenue as the \n“accommodation,” and it was designed to avoid imposing on organizations’ beliefs \nthat paying for or facilitating coverage for contraceptive care violates their \nreligion.  Id. at 39,874. \n  The agencies subsequently amended the accommodation in response to \nseveral legal challenges.  First, certain closely-held for-profit organizations became \n   5     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 6 6 o of f4 488\neligible for the accommodation.  Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Under \nthe Affordable Care Act, 80 Fed. Reg. 41,318-01, 41,343 (July 14, 2015); see also \nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2751, 2785 (2014).  Second, \ninstead of directly sending a copy of the self-certification form to the insurance \nprovider, an eligible organization could simply notify the Department of Health \nand Human Services in writing, and the agencies then would inform the provider \nof its regulatory obligations.  80 Fed. Reg. at 41,323; see also Wheaton Coll. v. \nBurwell, 134 S. Ct. 2806, 2807 (2014).   \n  Various employers then challenged the amended accommodation as a \nviolation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA).  Zubik v. Burwell, \n136 S. Ct. 1557, 1559 (2016) (per curiam).  The actions reached the Supreme \nCourt, but, instead of deciding the merits of the claims, the Supreme Court vacated \nand remanded to afford the parties “an opportunity to arrive at an approach going \nforward that accommodates petitioners’ religious exercise while at the same time \nensuring that women covered by petitioners’ health plans receive full and equal \nhealth coverage, including contraceptive coverage.”  Id. (internal quotation marks \nand citation omitted).  The agencies solicited comments on the accommodation in \nlight of Zubik, but ultimately declined to make further changes to the \naccommodation.  Dep’t of Labor, FAQS ABOUT AFFORDABLE CARE ACT \nIMPLEMENTATION PART 36, at 4, www.dol.gov/sites/default/files/ebsa/about-\n   6     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 7 7 o of f4 488\nebsa/our-activities/resource-center/faqs/aca-part-36.pdf.   \nB. \n  On May 4, 2017, the President issued an executive order directing the \nsecretaries of the agencies to “consider issuing amended regulations, consistent \nwith applicable law, to address conscience-based objections to” the ACA’s \ncontraceptive coverage requirement.  Promoting Free Speech and Religious \nLiberty, Exec. Order No. 13,798, 82 Fed. Reg. 21,675, 21,675 (May 4, 2017).  On \nOctober 6, 2017, the agencies effectuated the two IFRs challenged here, without \nprior notice and comment.  The religious exemption IFR expanded the categorical \nexemption to all entities “with sincerely held religious beliefs objecting to \ncontraceptive or sterilization coverage” and made the accommodation optional for \nsuch entities.  Religious Exemptions and Accommodations for Coverage of Certain \nPreventive Services Under the Affordable Care Act, 82 Fed. Reg. 47,792, 47,807–\n08 (Oct. 13, 2017).  The moral exemption IFR expanded the categorical exemption \nto “include additional entities and persons that object based on sincerely held \nmoral convictions.”  Moral Exemptions and Accommodations for Coverage of \nCertain Preventive Services Under the Affordable Care Act, 82 Fed. Reg. 47,838, \n47,849 (Oct. 13, 2017).  It also “expand[ed] eligibility for the accommodation to \ninclude organizations with sincerely held moral convictions concerning \ncontraceptive coverage” and made the accommodation optional for those entities.  \n   7     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 8 8 o of f4 488\nId. \n  California, Delaware, Maryland, New York, and Virginia sued the agencies \nand their secretaries in the Northern District of California.  The states sought to \nenjoin the enforcement of the IFRs, alleging that they are invalid under the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA), the Fifth Amendment equal protection \ncomponent of the Due Process Clause, and the First Amendment Establishment \nClause.  The district court held that venue was proper and that the states had \nstanding to challenge the IFRs.  The district court then issued a nationwide \npreliminary injunction based on the states’ likelihood of success on their APA \nclaim—that the IFRs were procedurally invalid for failing to follow notice and \ncomment rulemaking.  After issuing the injunction, the district court allowed Little \nSisters of the Poor, Jeanne Jugan Residence (Little Sisters) and March for Life \nEducation and Defense Fund (March for Life) to intervene in the case.   \n  The agencies, Little Sisters, and March for Life appeal from the district \ncourt’s order on venue, standing, and nationwide preliminary injunction.  \nII. \n  Venue is reviewed de novo.  Immigrant Assistance Project of the L.A. Cty. \nFed’n of Labor (AFL-CIO) v. INS, 306 F.3d 842, 868 (9th Cir. 2002).  Standing is \nalso reviewed de novo.  Am.-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm. v. Thornburgh, 970 \nF.2d 501, 506 (9th Cir. 1991).  Findings of fact used to support standing are \n   8     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 9 9 o of f4 488\nreviewed for clear error.  Id. \nA preliminary injunction is reviewed for abuse of discretion.  Pimentel v. \nDreyfus, 670 F.3d 1096, 1105 (9th Cir. 2012).  In reviewing the injunction, we \napply a two-part test.  First, we “determine de novo whether the trial court \nidentified the correct legal rule to apply to the relief requested.”  Id. (quoting Cal. \nPharmacists Ass’n v. Maxwell-Jolly, 596 F.3d 1098, 1104 (9th Cir. 2010).  Second, \nwe determine “if the district court’s application of the correct legal standard was \n(1) illogical, (2) implausible, or (3) without support in inferences that may be \ndrawn from the facts in the record.”  Id. (quoting Cal. Pharmacists, 596 F.3d at \n1104).  The scope of the preliminary injunction, such as its nationwide effect, is \nalso reviewed for abuse of discretion.  United States v. Schiff, 379 F.3d 621, 625 \n(9th Cir. 2004). \nIII. \nA. \n  We first address whether the appeal is moot.  We have authority only to \ndecide live controversies, and because mootness is a jurisdictional issue, we are \nobliged to raise it sua sponte.  Gator.com Corp. v. L.L. Bean, Inc., 398 F.3d 1125, \n1129 (9th Cir. 2005) (en banc).  We determine “questions of mootness in light of \nthe present circumstances where injunctions are involved.”  Mitchell v. Dupnik, 75 \nF.3d 517, 528 (9th Cir. 1996).  More specifically, the question before us is \n   9     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 1 100 o of f4 488\n“whether changes in circumstances that prevailed at the beginning of litigation \nhave forestalled any occasion for meaningful relief.”  Gator.com, 398 F.3d at 1129 \n(quoting West v. Sec’y of the Dep’t of Transp., 206 F.3d 920, 925 n.4 (9th Cir. \n2000)). \n  On November 15, 2018, the agencies published final versions of the \nreligious and moral exemption IFRs.  See Religious Exemptions and \nAccommodations for Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Under the \nAffordable Care Act, 83 Fed. Reg. 57,536 (Nov. 15, 2018); Moral Exemptions and \nAccommodations for Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Under the \nAffordable Care Act, 83 Fed. Reg. 57,592 (Nov. 15, 2018).  The final rules are set \nto supersede the IFRs and become effective on January 14, 2019.  Id.  The district \ncourt’s preliminary injunction rested solely on its conclusion that the IFRs are \nlikely to be procedurally invalid under the APA.  If the final rules become effective \nas planned on January 14, there will be no justiciable controversy regarding the \nprocedural defects of IFRs that no longer exist.  Indeed, we have previously \ndismissed a procedural challenge to an interim rule as moot after the rule expired.  \nSafari Aviation Inc. v. Garvey, 300 F.3d 1144, 1150 (9th Cir. 2002); see also \nNRDC v. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Comm’n, 680 F.2d 810, 814–15 (D.C.

We agree with the parties that mootness \nis not an issue until the final rules supersede the IFRs as expected on January 14, \n2019.  The IFRs have not been superseded yet, and the procedural validity of the \nIFRs is a live controversy.  We can still grant the parties effective relief.  \nMootness, if at all, will arise only after our decision has issued.  Accordingly, we \nhave jurisdiction to decide this appeal. \nB. \n  We hold that venue is proper in the Northern District of California.  A civil \naction against an officer of the United States in his or her official capacity may “be \nbrought in any judicial district in which . . . the plaintiff resides if no real property \nis involved in the action.”  28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1).  There is no real property \ninvolved here.  The inquiry thus turns on which judicial district(s)—for a state with \nmultiple districts like California—a state is considered to reside.  This is a question \nof first impression in this circuit. \n  The agencies argue that California resides only in the Eastern District of \nCalifornia, where the state capital is located.  The agencies cite 28 U.S.C. § \n   11     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 1 122 o of f4 488\n1391(c), which defines residency for “a natural person,” “an entity,” and “a \ndefendant not resident in the United States.”  Relevant here, “an entity with the \ncapacity to sue and be sued . . . whether or not incorporated” is deemed to reside \n“only in the judicial district in which it maintains its principal place of business.”  \nId. § 1391(c)(2).  The agencies argue that California is an “entity” and that its \ncapital Sacramento, located in the Eastern District of California, is the principal \nplace of business for the state.   \nThe agencies’ argument is unconvincing.  We must “interpret [the] statut[e] \nas a whole, giving effect to each word and making every effort not to interpret a \nprovision in a manner that renders other provisions of the same statute inconsistent, \nmeaningless or superfluous.”  United States v. Thomsen, 830 F.3d 1049, 1057 (9th \nCir. 2016) (citation omitted and alterations in original).  The venue statute \nexplicitly refers to the incorporation status of the “entity,” indicating that the term \nrefers to some organization, not a state.  See 28 U.S.C. § 1391(c)(2) (“an entity . . . \nwhether or not incorporated”).  The legislative history confirms this interpretation.  \nAccording to the House Report underlying section 1391(c)(2), the section is a \nresponse to “division in authority as to the venue treatment of unincorporated \nassociations” and that the section, as stated, would treat equally corporations and \nunincorporated associations like partnerships and labor unions.  See H.R. Rep. No. \n112-10, at 21 (2011).  These types of entities do not encompass sovereign states.  \n   12     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 1 133 o of f4 488\nFinally, we highlight that the statute explicitly distinguishes between states and \nentities.  28 U.S.C. § 1391(d); see also Spencer Enters., Inc. v. United States., 345 \nF.3d 683, 689 (9th Cir. 2003) (“[U]se of different words or terms within a statute \ndemonstrates that Congress intended to convey a different meaning for those \nwords”).  The agencies therefore improperly assume, without support from the text \nor legislative history, that “entity” encompasses a state acting as a plaintiff. \nInstead, we interpret the statute based on its plain language.  A state is \nubiquitous throughout its sovereign borders.  The text of the statute therefore \ndictates that a state with multiple judicial districts “resides” in every district within \nits borders.  See Alabama v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 382 F. Supp. 2d 1301, \n1329 (N.D. Ala. 2005) (holding that, for purposes of 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e), \n“common sense dictates that a state resides throughout its sovereign borders”); see \nalso Atlanta & F.R. Co. v. W. Ry. Co. of Ala., 50 F. 790, 791 (5th Cir. 1892) \n(discussing that “the state government . . . resides at every point within the \nboundaries of the state”).  Any other interpretation limiting residency to a single \ndistrict in the state would defy common sense.  See Silvers v. Sony Pictures Entm’t, \nInc., 402 F.3d 881, 900 (9th Cir. 2005) (“[C]ourts will not interpret a statute in a \nway that results in an absurd or unreasonable result”).  Venue is thus proper in the \nNorthern District of California. \nC. \n   13     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 1 144 o of f4 488\nWe hold that the states have standing to sue.  The states bear the burden of \nestablishing “the irreducible constitutional minimum” of standing.  Spokeo, Inc. v. \nRobins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The \nstates must have suffered an injury-in-fact that is fairly traceable to the challenged \nconduct and that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.  Id.  The \nstates must also demonstrate standing for each claim they seek to press.  \nDaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 352 (2006).  Standing as to one \nclaim does not “suffice for all claims arising from the same ‘nucleus of operative \nfact.’”  Id.   \nThe district court held that the states had standing to assert their procedural \nAPA claim.  To establish an injury-in-fact, a plaintiff challenging the violation of a \nprocedural right must demonstrate (1) that he has a procedural right that, if \nexercised, could have protected his concrete interests, (2) that the procedures in \nquestion are designed to protect those concrete interests, and (3) that the \nchallenged action’s threat to the plaintiff’s concrete interests is reasonably \nprobable.  Citizens for Better Forestry v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 341 F.3d 961, 969–\n70 (9th Cir. 2003); see also Spokeo, 136 S. Ct. at 1540 (describing the applicable \nstandards for Article III standing in the context of statutory procedural rights).  \n“[D]eprivation of a procedural right without some concrete interest that is affected \nby the deprivation . . . is insufficient to create Article III standing.”  Summers v. \n   14     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 1 155 o of f4 488\nEarth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 496 (2009).  Relaxed standards apply to the \ntraceability and redressability requirements.  See NRDC v. Jewell, 749 F.3d 776, \n782–83 (9th Cir. 2014) (en banc) (“One who challenges the violation of ‘a \nprocedural right to protect his concrete interests can assert that right without \nmeeting all the normal standards’ for traceability and redressibility.”  (quoting \nLujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 572 n.7 (1992))).  The plaintiff need not \nprove that the substantive result would have been different had he received proper \nprocedure; all that is necessary is to show that proper procedure could have done \nso.  Citizens for Better Forestry, 341 F.3d at 976. \nThe states argue that the agencies issued the religious and moral exemption \nIFRs without notice and comment as required under the APA.  They argue that the \ndeprivation of this procedural right affected their economic interests.  According to \nthe states, the IFRs expanded the number of employers categorically exempt from \nthe ACA’s contraceptive coverage requirement, and states will incur significant \ncosts as a result of their residents’ reduced access to contraceptive care.  The states \nspecifically identify three ways in which the IFRs will economically harm them.  \nFirst, women who lose coverage will seek contraceptive care through state-run \nprograms or programs that the states are responsible for reimbursing.  Second, \nwomen who do not qualify for or cannot afford such programs will be at risk for \nunintended pregnancies, which impose financial costs on the state.  Third, reduced \n   15     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 1 166 o of f4 488\naccess to contraceptive care will negatively affect women’s educational attainment \nand ability to participate in the labor force, affecting their contributions as \ntaxpayers.  Because we conclude that the record supports the first theory, we do \nnot reach the alternative theories.  See, e.g., Washington v. Trump, 847 F.3d 1151, \n1161 & n.5 (9th Cir. 2017) (per curiam) (holding that the plaintiffs had standing \nand declining to reach alternative theories of standing). \nAppellants do not dispute that the states were denied notice and opportunity \nto comment on the IFRs prior to their effective date.  They do not dispute that the \nnotice and comment process could have protected and was designed to protect the \nstates’ economic interests.  Instead, the appellants dispute whether the threat to the \nstates’ economic interests is reasonably probable.  They argue that the allegations \nof economic injury are based on a speculative chain of events unlikely to occur.  \nCf. Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 414 (2013) (rejecting standing \nwhere “respondents’ speculative chain of possibilities does not establish that injury \n. . . is certainly impending or is fairly traceable”).  Appellants highlight how the \nstates have failed to prove (1) that employers will take advantage of the expanded \nreligious and moral exemptions, (2) that women will lose contraceptive coverage \nas a result, and (3) that states will then incur economic costs.   \nWe hold that the states have standing to sue on their procedural APA claim.  \nThe states show, with reasonable probability, that the IFRs will first lead to women \n   16     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 1 177 o of f4 488\nlosing employer-sponsored contraceptive coverage, which will then result in \neconomic harm to the states.  See Citizens for Better Forestry, 341 F.3d at 969.  \nJust because a causal chain links the states to the harm does not foreclose standing.  \nSee Maya v. Centex Corp., 658 F.3d 1060, 1070 (9th Cir. 2011) (“A causal chain \ndoes not fail simply because it has several ‘links,’ provided those links are not \nhypothetical or tenuous” (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).  The \nstates need not have already suffered economic harm.  See City of Sausalito v. \nO’Neill, 386 F.3d 1186, 1197 (9th Cir. 2004) (requiring only that the protected \nconcrete interest be “threatened”).  There is also no requirement that the economic \nharm be of a certain magnitude.  See United States v. Students Challenging \nRegulatory Agency Procedures (SCRAP), 412 U.S. 669, 689 n.14 (1973) \n(explaining that injuries of only a few dollars can establish standing).   \n  First, it is reasonably probable that women in the plaintiff states will lose \nsome or all employer-sponsored contraceptive coverage due to the IFRs.  The \nagencies’ own regulatory impact analysis (RIA)—which explains the anticipated \ncosts, benefits, and effects of the IFRs—estimates that between 31,700 and \n120,000 women nationwide will lose some coverage.  See 82 Fed. Reg. at 47,821, \n47,823.  Importantly, when making these estimates, the agencies accounted for key \nfactors likely to skew the estimate, including that some objecting employers will \ncontinue to use the accommodation instead of the new, expanded exemptions.  See \n   17     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 1 188 o of f4 488\nid. at 47,818 (estimating that 109 entities—of the 209 entities who have litigated \nthe contraceptive care requirement and are currently using the accommodation \nprocess—would seek exemption); id. (“We expect the 122 nonprofit entities that \nspecifically challenged the accommodation in court to use the expanded \nexemption”).  The record also includes names of specific employers identified by \nthe RIA as likely to use the expanded exemptions, including those operating in the \nplaintiff states like Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.  Appellants fault the states for failing \nto identify a specific woman likely to lose coverage.  Such identification is not \nnecessary to establish standing.  For example, in Sierra Forest Legacy v. Sherman, \nCalifornia challenged a forest-management plan that changed the standards \ngoverning logging on a parcel of land.  646 F.3d 1161, 1171–72 (9th Cir. 2011).  \nThe state’s standing to do so was based on future injury resulting from any logging \nunder the plan.  Id. at 1178 (maj. op. of Fisher, J.).  We emphasized that the state’s \nstanding to challenge the plan “is not defeated by its not having submitted \naffidavits establishing approval of specific logging projects under” the plan \nbecause “there is no real possibility that the [relevant agency] will . . . decline to \nadopt” any project under the plan.  Id. at 1179.  The same is true here.  Evidence \nsupports that, with reasonable probability, some women residing in the plaintiff \nstates will lose coverage due to the IFRs.   \n   18     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 1 199 o of f4 488\nSecond, it is reasonably probable that loss of coverage will inflict economic \nharm to the states.  The RIA estimates the direct cost of filling the coverage loss as \n$18.5 or $63.8 million per year, depending on the method of estimating.  82 Fed. \nReg. at 47,821, 47,824.  More importantly, the RIA identifies that state and local \nprograms “provide free or subsidized contraceptives for low-income women” and \nconcludes that this “existing inter-governmental structure for obtaining \ncontraceptives significantly diminishes” the impact of the expanded exemptions.  \nId. at 47,803.  The RIA itself thus assumed that state and local governments will \nbear additional economic costs. \nThe declarations submitted by the states further show that women losing \ncoverage from their employers will turn to state-based programs or programs \nreimbursed by the state.  For example, California offers the Family Planning, \nAccess, Care, and Treatment (Family PACT) program to provide contraceptive \ncare to those below 200% of the federal poverty level.  As attested to by program \nadministrators, loss of coverage due to the IFRs will result in increased enrollment \nto Family PACT.  Increased enrollment translates into, for example, the state \nreimbursing Planned Parenthood about $74.96 for each enrollee who receives \ncontraceptive care.  The states provided similar evidence for New York, Maryland, \nDelaware, and Virginia, which all have state-funded family planning programs.   \n   19     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 2 200 o of f4 488\nAppellants dispute various factual findings underlying standing, but they do \nnot explain how those findings are clearly erroneous.  Appellants also argue that \nfour of the plaintiff states—California, Delaware, Maryland, and New York—will \nnot suffer harm because they have state laws that independently require certain \nemployer-provided plans to cover contraceptive care.  Those state laws do not \napply to self-insured (also called self-funded) plans.  See 29 U.S.C. § 1144(a) \n(preempting “any and all state laws” on this subject).  Evidence shows that \nmillions of people are covered, in each of the four states, under self-insured plans.  \nFor example, Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. covers its employees through self-insured \nplans.  Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v. Sebelius, 723 F.3d 1114, 1124 (10th Cir. 2013), \naff’d sub nom. Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2751 (2014).  \nAppellants’ argument does not even apply to Virginia, which does not have any \nstate law requiring coverage for contraceptive care.   \nAccordingly, the states have shown that the threat to their economic interest \nis reasonably probable, and they have established a procedural injury.  Cf. East Bay \nSanctuary Covenant v. Trump, No. 18-17274, 2018 WL 6428204, at *12 n.8 (9th \nCir. Dec. 7, 2018) (order) (holding that the plaintiffs “have adequately identified \nconcrete interests impaired by the Rule and thus have standing to challenge the \nabsence of notice-and-comment procedures in promulgating it”).  “[T]he causation \nand redressability requirements are relaxed” once a plaintiff has established a \n   20     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 2 211 o of f4 488\nprocedural injury, Citizens for Better Forestry, 341 F.3d at 975 (quoting Pub. \nCitizen v. Dep’t of Transp., 316 F.3d 1002, 1016 (9th Cir. 2003)), and both \nrequirements are met here.  The injury asserted is traceable to the agencies’ issuing \nthe IFRs allegedly in violation of the APA’s requirements, and granting an \ninjunction would prohibit enforcement of the IFRs.  The states have thus \nestablished standing.1 \nThe dissent raises a theory not advanced by any party.  According to the \ndissent, the states’ economic injuries, if any, will be self-inflicted because the \nstates voluntarily chose to provide money for contraceptive care to its residents \nthrough state programs.  The dissent argues that the states lack standing because \nsuch “self-inflicted” injuries are not traceable to the agencies’ conduct, citing \nPennsylvania v. New Jersey, 426 U.S. 660 (1976) (per curiam).  In Pennsylvania, \nthe plaintiff states challenged other states’ laws that increased taxes on nonresident \nincome.  426 U.S. at 662–63.  The plaintiff states provided tax credits to their \nresidents for taxes paid to other states.  Id. at 662.  Accordingly, the defendant \n                                           \n1 In addition to establishing constitutional standing, “[a] plaintiff must also satisfy \nthe non-constitutional standing requirements of the statute under which [it] seeks to \nbring suit.”  City of Sausalito, 386 F.3d at 1199.  In a single sentence, Little Sisters \nargues that the states lack statutory standing.  This argument is waived.  See \nGreenwood v. FAA, 28 F.3d 971, 977 (9th Cir. 1994) (“We review only issues \nwhich are argued specifically and distinctly in a party’s opening brief . . . [and a] \nbare assertion does not preserve a claim” (citation omitted)); Bilyeu v. Morgan \nStanley Long Term Disability Plan, 683 F.3d 1083, 1090 (9th Cir. 2012) (holding \nthat “statutory standing may be waived”). \n   21     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 2 222 o of f4 488\nstates’ tax increases also increased the amount of tax credits provided by the \nplaintiff states, and the plaintiff states lost revenue.  Id.  In denying leave to file \nbills of complaint invoking the Supreme Court’s original jurisdiction, the Court \nheld that the plaintiff states could not “demonstrate that the injury for which [they \nsought] redress was directly caused by the actions of another State” because the \ninjuries to the plaintiff states’ fiscs “were self-inflicted . . . and nothing prevents \n[them] from withdrawing [the] credit for taxes paid to [defendant states].”  Id. at \n664. \nWe question whether the holding of Pennsylvania applies outside the \nspecific requirements for the invocation of the Supreme Court’s original \njurisdiction.  Courts regularly entertain actions brought by states and municipalities \nthat face economic injury, even though those governmental entities theoretically \ncould avoid the injury by enacting new legislation.  See, e.g., South Dakota v. \nDole, 483 U.S. 203 (1987) (addressing South Dakota’s challenge to highway \nfunding conditioned on a minimum drinking age, even though South Dakota could \nhave avoided the injury by changing its minimum drinking age); Gladstone \nRealtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 110–11 (1979) (holding that a \nmunicipality suffered an injury from a reduction in its property tax base, even \nthough nothing required the municipality to impose property taxes).  But we need \nnot decide whether Pennsylvania’s “self-infliction” doctrine applies to the ordinary \n   22     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 2 233 o of f4 488\ninjury-in-fact requirement of Article III standing because, as explained below, the \ninjury here is not “self-inflicted” within the meaning of Pennsylvania. \nThe Supreme Court later held, in Wyoming v. Oklahoma, that Wyoming had \nstanding to challenge an Oklahoma statute that decreased Wyoming’s revenue—\nfrom tax on coal mined in Wyoming—by requiring Oklahoma power plants to \nburn at least 10% Oklahoma-mined coal.  502 U.S. 437, 447–48 (1992).  The Court \nhighlighted that Wyoming suffered a “direct injury in the form of a loss of specific \ntax revenues” from the reduced demand for Wyoming coal caused by the \nOklahoma statute.  Id. at 448. \nBoth Pennsylvania and Wyoming involved harm to the plaintiff states’ fiscs \nthat were, as described by the dissent, “self-inflicted.”  What distinguishes the two \ncases, and what caused the Supreme Court to reach different results, is that the \nplaintiff states’ laws in Pennsylvania directly and explicitly tied the states’ finances \n(revenue loss caused by tax credit) to another sovereign’s laws (other states’ taxes \non nonresident income).  See Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U.S. 725, 742 n.18 \n(1981) (“In Pennsylvania, the only reason that the complaining States were denied \ntax revenues was because their legislatures had determined to give a credit for \ntaxes paid to other States, and, to this extent, any injury was voluntarily suffered”).  \nWyoming did not involve such state laws; the tax on Wyoming-mined coal was not \nso tethered to the legislative decisions of other sovereigns.  The same is true of the \n   23     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 2 244 o of f4 488\ncontraceptive coverage laws of the plaintiff states here.  Accordingly, we are not \nconvinced that Pennsylvania controls in this case.  Cf. Texas v. United States, 809 \nF.3d 134, 158–59 (5th Cir. 2015), as revised (Nov. 25, 2015); Texas v.

The scope of the injunction is overbroad. \nA preliminary injunction is a matter of equitable discretion and is “an \nextraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the \nplaintiff is entitled to such relief.”  Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008) (citation \nomitted).  “A party can obtain a preliminary injunction by showing that (1) it is \n‘likely to succeed on the merits,’ (2) it is ‘likely to suffer irreparable harm in the \nabsence of preliminary relief,’ (3) ‘the balance of equities tips in [its] favor,’ and \n(4) ‘an injunction is in the public interest.’”  Disney Enters., Inc. v. VidAngel, Inc., \n869 F.3d 848, 856 (9th Cir. 2017) (alteration in original) (quoting Winter, 555 U.S. \nat 20).  When the government is a party, the last two factors merge.

Disney, 869 F.3d at 856 (citation omitted).  The district court held that the \nstates are likely to succeed on the merits of their APA claim.  We agree. \nThe APA requires that, prior to promulgating rules, an agency must issue a \ngeneral notice of proposed rulemaking, 5 U.S.C. § 553(b), and “give interested \npersons an opportunity to participate in the rule making through submission of \nwritten data, views or arguments,” id. § 553(c).  A court must set aside rules made \n“without observance of [this] procedure.”  Id. § 706(2)(D).  Again, the parties do \nnot dispute that the religious and moral exemption IFRs were issued without notice \nand comment.  The only remaining issue is whether prior notice and comment was \nnot required because an exception to this rule applied. \nExceptions to notice and comment rulemaking “are not lightly to be \npresumed.” Marcello v. Bonds, 349 U.S. 302, 310 (1955). “[I]t is antithetical to the \nstructure and purpose of the APA for an agency to implement a rule first, and then \nseek comment later.”  Paulsen v. Daniels, 413 F.3d 999, 1005 (9th Cir. 2005).  \nFailure to follow notice and comment rulemaking may be excused when good \ncause exists, 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(B); when a subsequent statute authorizes it, id. § \n559; and when it is harmless, id. § 706.  Appellants argue that each of these three \nexceptions applies here.   \n   25     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 2 266 o of f4 488\nWe begin by examining whether the agencies had good cause for bypassing \nnotice and comment.  An agency may “for good cause find[] . . . that notice and \npublic procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public \ninterest.”  5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(B).  “[T]he good cause exception goes only as far as \nits name implies: It authorizes departures from the APA’s requirements only when \ncompliance would interfere with the agency’s ability to carry out its mission.”  \nRiverbend Farms, Inc. v. Madigan, 958 F.2d 1479, 1485 (9th Cir. 1992).  Good \ncause is to be “narrowly construed and only reluctantly countenanced.”  Alcaraz v. \nBlock, 746 F.2d 593, 612 (9th Cir. 1984) (citation omitted).  As such, the good \ncause exception is usually invoked in emergencies, and an agency must “overcome \na high bar” to do so.  United States v. Valverde, 628 F.3d 1159, 1164–65 (9th Cir. \n2010).  Because good cause is determined on a “case-by-case” basis, based on “the \ntotality of the factors at play,” Valverde, 628 F.3d at 1164 (quoting Alcaraz, 746, \nF.2d at 612), prior invocations of good cause to justify different IFRs—the legality \nof which are not challenged here—have no relevance. 2  \n  In the past, we have acknowledged good cause where the agency cannot \n“both follow section 553 and execute its statutory duties.”  Riverbend, 958 F.2d at \n                                           \n2 The Little Sisters argue that if the court invalidates the IFRs here, the court must \nalso invalidate prior ones related to the exemption and accommodation.  This \nargument is unpersuasive.  Whether or not those IFRs were promulgated with good \ncause, they are not before us at this time. \n   26     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 2 277 o of f4 488\n1484 n.2 (quoting Levesque v.

Helicopter Operators Ass’n v. \nFAA, 51 F.3d 212, 214 (9th Cir. 1995) (good cause shown based on threat reflected \nin an increasing number of helicopter accidents); Jifry v.

Cir. 2004) (upholding good cause determination that the rule was \n“necessary to prevent a possible imminent hazard to aircraft, persons, and property \nwithin the United States”).   \nThe agencies here determined that “it would be impracticable and contrary \nto the public interest to engage in full notice and comment rulemaking before \nputting these [IFRs] into effect.”  See, e.g., 82 Fed. Reg. at 47,815; see also 82 Fed. \nReg. at 47,856.  They recited the immediate need to (1) reduce the legal and \nregulatory uncertainty regarding the accommodation in the wake of Zubik, (2) \neliminate RFRA violations by reducing the burden on religious beliefs of objecting \nemployers, and (3) reduce the costs of health insurance.3  82 Fed. Reg. at 47,813–\n                                           \n3 Little Sisters argues that the agencies had good cause because the prior regulatory \nregime violated the Free Exercise Clause and the Establishment Clause.  This \nassertion was not part of the agencies’ original good cause findings, and we may \nnot consider it now.  See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm \nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 50 (1983) (“[A]n agency’s action must be upheld, \nif at all, on the basis articulated by the agency itself”).   \n   27     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 2 288 o of f4 488\n15; 82 Fed. Reg. at 47,855–56.  These general policy justifications are insufficient \nto establish good cause.   \nFirst, an agency’s desire to eliminate more quickly legal and regulatory \nuncertainty is not by itself good cause.  See Valverde, 628 F.3d at 1167 \n(concluding that an agency’s “interest in eliminating uncertainty does not justify its \nhaving sought to forego notice and comment”).  “If ‘good cause’ could be satisfied \nby an Agency’s assertion that ‘normal procedures were not followed because of the \nneed to provide immediate guidance and information[,] . . . then an exception to \nthe notice requirement would be created that would swallow the rule.’”  Id. \n(alterations in original) (quoting Zhang v. Slattery, 55 F.3d 732, 746 (2d Cir. \n1995)); see also Envtl. Def. Fund, Inc. v. EPA, 716 F.2d 915, 920–21 (D.C. Cir. \n1983) (“[I]t was not at all reasonable for [the agency] to rely on the good cause \nexception” simply because of “an alleged pressing need to avoid industry \ncompliance with regulations that were to be eliminated”).  Furthermore, the \nagencies’ request for post-promulgation comments in issuing the IFRs “casts \nfurther doubt upon the authenticity and efficacy of the asserted need to clear up \npotential uncertainty,” Valverde, 628 F.3d at 1166, because allowing for post-\npromulgation comments implicitly suggests that the rules will be reconsidered and \nthat the “level of uncertainty is, at best, unchanged,” United States v. Reynolds, \n710 F.3d 498, 510 (3d Cir. 2013) (citing United States v. Johnson, 632 F.3d 912, \n   28     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 2 299 o of f4 488\n929 (5th Cir. 2011)).  This explanation therefore fails.  It is always the case that an \nagency can regulate—or in this case, de-regulate—faster by issuing an IFR without \nnotice and comment.   \nSecond, we of course acknowledge that eliminating RFRA violations by \nreducing the burden on religious beliefs is an important consideration for the \nagencies.  Any delay in rectifying violations of statutory rights has the potential to \ndo real harm.  See Buschmann v. Schweiker, 676 F.2d 352, 357 (9th Cir. 1982) \n(“The notice and comment procedures in Section 553 should be waived only when \ndelay would do real harm”).  Whether the accommodation actually violates RFRA \nis a question left open by the Supreme Court.4  See Zubik, 136 S. Ct. at 1560.  But \nwe need not determine whether there is a RFRA violation here because, even if \nimmediately remedying the RFRA violation constituted good cause, the agencies’ \nreliance on this justification was not a reasoned decision based on findings in the \nrecord.  See Valverde, 628 F.3d at 1165, 1168 (agencies must provide “rational \njustification” and identify “rational connection between the facts found and the \nchoice made to promulgate the interim rule” (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted)).  In January 2017, the agencies explicitly declined to change the \n                                           \n4 Before Zubik, eight courts of appeals (of the nine to have considered the issue) \nhave found that the regulatory regime in place prior to the IFRs did not impose a \nsubstantial burden on religious exercise under RFRA.  See, e.g., E. Tex. Baptist \nUniv. v. Burwell, 793 F.3d 449 (5th Cir. 2015), vacated, Zubik, 136 S.Ct. at 1561.   \n   29     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 3 300 o of f4 488\naccommodation in light of Zubik and RFRA.  They then let nine months go by and \nfailed to specify what developments necessitated the agencies to change their \nposition and determine, in October 2017, that RFRA violations existed.  Cf. id. at \n1166 (reasoning that agency finding of urgent need was inadequate when agency \nhad allowed seven months to pass without action).  The agencies provided no \nexplanation, legal or otherwise, for their changed understanding.  Cf. Encino \nMotorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 136 S. Ct. 2117, 2125–26 (2016) (holding that an \nagency’s unexplained change in position does not warrant deference); East Bay \nSanctuary Covenant, 2018 WL 6428204, at *20 (concluding that “speculative” \nreasoning is insufficient to support good cause).  The IFRs are devoid of any \nfindings related to the issue.  Indeed, the agencies cited no intervening legal \nauthority for their justification, in contrast to when they issued an IFR in light of \nWheaton.  Given these failures, the agency action cannot be upheld on unexplained \nabout-face. \nThe agencies further argue that the new IFRs will decrease insurance costs \nfor entities remaining on more expensive grandfathered plans—which are exempt \nfrom the contraceptive coverage requirement—to avoid becoming subject to the \nrequirement.  82 Fed. Reg. at 47,815; 82 Fed. Reg. at 47,855-56.  This is \nspeculation unsupported by the administrative record and is not sufficient to \n   30     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 3 311 o of f4 488\nconstitute good cause.  See Valverde, 628 F.3d at 1167 (“[C]onclusory speculative \nharms the [agency] cites are not sufficient” (citation omitted)). \nWe also highlight that there was no urgent deadline to issue the IFRs that \ninterfered with the agencies from complying with the APA.5  Congress had not \nimposed a deadline here on agency decisionmaking that interfered with \ncompliance.  The President’s executive order merely asks the agencies to “consider \nissuing amended regulations, consistent with applicable law, to address \nconscience-based objections to the preventive-care mandate.”  82 Fed. Reg. at \n21,675.  Neither did the Supreme Court mandate any deadline when it remanded \nthe last challenge to the accommodation in order to give parties “an opportunity to \narrive at an approach going forward.”  Zubik, 136 S. Ct. at 1560.   \nThe agencies cite two cases in support of their good cause claim: Priests For \nLife v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 772 F.3d 229 (D.C. Cir. 2014), \nvacated and remanded sub nom. Zubik, 136 S. Ct. at 1557; and Serv. Employees \nInt’l Union, Local 102 v. Cty. of San Diego, 60 F.3d 1346 (9th Cir. 1994).  Both \nare distinguishable.  The D.C. Circuit in Priests for Life rejected the plaintiffs’ \nargument that the government lacked good cause to promulgate IFRs without \n                                           \n5 We also point out that the agencies have not displayed urgency in reaching final \nresolution of this case.  After filing this appeal from the district court’s order \ngranting a preliminary injunction, the agencies filed a stipulation staying further \ndistrict court proceedings pending resolution of the appeal.  Before the district \ncourt, this case has remained in abeyance for nearly a year. \n   31     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 3 322 o of f4 488\nnotice and comment.  772 F.3d at 276–77.  In so holding, it emphasized that the \nIFRs modified existing regulations that “were recently enacted pursuant to notice \nand comment rulemaking, and presented virtually identical issues” as the \nchallenged IFRs.  Id. at 276 (emphasis added); see also id. (describing the \nmodifications in the new IFRs as “minor”).  The IFRs here do not present minor \nchanges.  They substantially expanded the categorical exemption and effectively \nmade accommodations voluntary.  The IFRs also introduced an entirely new moral \nexemption that had never been the subject of previous regulations.  These \nsubstantial changes came after the agencies previously determined that no change \nto the religious accommodation process was needed in light of RFRA.  In Serv. \nEmployees Int’l Union, we held that resolving uncertainty caused by conflicting \njudicial decisions is sufficient good cause.  60 F.3d at 1352 n.3.  In that case, \nresolving uncertainty was sufficient because the agencies found that conflicting \ndecisions were poised to cause “enormous” and “unforeseen” financial liability \n“threaten[ing] [the] fiscal integrity” of state and local governments.  Id.  When \nissuing the IFRs here, the agencies cited no such comparable financial threat.   \nAccordingly, based on the totality of the circumstances, the agencies likely \ndid not have good cause for bypassing notice and comment. \nWe next turn to whether the agencies had statutory authority for bypassing \nnotice and comment.  The APA cautions “that no subsequent statute shall be \n   32     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 3 333 o of f4 488\ndeemed to modify it ‘except to the extent that it does so expressly.’” Castillo-\nVillagra v. INS, 972 F.2d 1017, 1025 (9th Cir. 1992) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 559); see \nalso Asiana Airlines v. FAA, 134 F.3d 393, 397 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (defining the \ninquiry as “whether Congress has established procedures so clearly different from \nthose required by the APA that it must have intended to displace the norm”).  The \nagencies point to three statutory provisions enacted as part of the Health Insurance \nPortability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). These provisions specify: \nThe Secretary, consistent with section 104 of the Health [Insurance] \nPortability  and  Accountability  Act  of  1996,  may  promulgate  such \nregulations  as  may  be  necessary  or  appropriate  to  carry  out  the \nprovisions of this subchapter.  The Secretary  may promulgate any \ninterim final rules as the Secretary determines are appropriate to carry \nout this subchapter. \n \n26 U.S.C. § 9833; 29 U.S.C. § 1191c; 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-92.  When enacting the \nACA, Congress codified the contraceptive coverage requirement in the same \nchapters of the United States Code as those provisions.  The agencies argue that the \nprovisions authorize them to issue IFRs implementing the ACA without notice and \ncomment.   \nTheir argument likely fails.  The identified provisions authorize agencies to \nissue IFRs, but they are silent as to any required procedure for issuing an IFR.  \nThey do not provide that notice and comment is supplanted or that good cause is \nno longer required.  They neither contain express language exempting agencies \nfrom the APA nor provide alternative procedures that could reasonably be \n   33     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 3 344 o of f4 488\nunderstood as departing from the APA.  See Castillo-Villagra, 972 F.2d at 1025 \n(holding that a subsequent statute must “expressly” modify the APA). These \nprovisions thus stand in contrast to other provisions that we have found to be \nexpress abdications of the APA.  See, e.g, id. (holding that APA was supplanted by \nstatute that stated “the procedure so prescribed shall be the sole and exclusive \nprocedure for determining the deportability of an alien under this section” (internal \nquotation marks omitted)); Methodist Hosp. of Sacramento v. Shalala, 38 F.3d \n1225, 1236 n.18 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (holding that APA was supplanted by statute that \nstated “[t]he Secretary shall cause to be published in the Federal Register a notice \nof the interim final DRG prospective payment rates” (emphasis added)).   \nThe agencies insist that we must read HIPAA’s use of the word “interim” as \nsinglehandedly authorizing the agencies to issue IFRs without notice and comment \nwhenever the agencies deem it appropriate.  Otherwise, the agencies warn, we will \nbe rendering superfluous the second sentence of the quoted provisions.  We \ndisagree. \n  The first sentence of the quoted provisions authorizes the issuance of \nregulations “consistent with section 104 of the Health [Insurance] Portability and \nAccountability Act of 1996.”  Section 104 of HIPAA, entitled “Assuring \nCoordination,” generally requires the three Secretaries to coordinate their \n   34     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 3 355 o of f4 488\nregulations and policies.6  Notably, the second sentence of the quoted provisions \ndoes not contain the same consistency requirement; each Secretary is authorized to \nissue IFRs without ensuring consistency with the rules of his or her partner \nSecretaries.  Reading both sentences together, Congress authorized the Secretaries \nto issue coordinated final rules in the ordinary course; and, if a Secretary met an \ninter-agency impasse but needed to regulate within his or her own domain \ntemporarily while sorting out the inter-agency conflict, then a Secretary could issue \nan interim final rule.  In this procedural posture, we need not delimit the full scope \nof the second sentence of the quoted provisions.  For present purposes, it suffices \n                                           \n6 Section 104 states: \n \nThe Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, and the Secretary of Labor shall ensure, through the execution \nof  an  interagency  memorandum  of  understanding  among  such \nSecretaries, that— \n \n(1) regulations, rulings, and interpretations issued by such Secretaries \nrelating to the same matter over which two or more such Secretaries \nhave responsibility under this subtitle (and the amendments made by \nthis subtitle and section 401) are administered so as to have the same \neffect at all times; and \n \n(2) coordination of policies relating to enforcing the same requirements \nthrough such Secretaries in order to have a coordinated enforcement \nstrategy that avoids duplication of enforcement efforts and assigns \npriorities in enforcement. \n \nPub. L. No. 104-191, § 401, 110 Stat. 1976 (1996) (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-\n92 note). \n   35     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 3 366 o of f4 488\nto observe that we need not give the second sentence the agencies’ expansive \ninterpretation in order for the second sentence to retain independent effect. \nAccordingly, the agencies likely did not have statutory authority for \nbypassing notice and comment. \nWe last turn to whether bypassing notice and comment was harmless.  The \ncourt “must exercise great caution in applying the harmless error rule in the \nadministrative rulemaking context.”  Riverbend, 958 F.2d at 1487.  “[T]he failure \nto provide notice and comment is harmless only where the agency’s mistake \n‘clearly had no bearing on the procedure used or the substance of decision \nreached.’”  Id. (quoting Sagebrush Rebellion, Inc. v. Hodel, 790 F.2d 760, 764–65 \n(9th Cir. 1986)). \nThe circumstances here are similar to those in Paulsen, 413 F.3d at 1006.  \nThere, the Bureau of Prisons “failed to provide the required notice-and-comment \nperiod before effectuating [an] interim regulation, thereby precluding public \nparticipation in the rulemaking.”  Id.  We held the error not harmless because \n“petitioners received no notice of any kind until after the Bureau made the . . . \ninterim rule effective.”  Id. at 1007.  We further emphasized that “an opportunity to \nprotest an already-effective rule” did not render the violation harmless.  Id. \n(emphasis added).  We distinguished from prior cases where “interested parties \nreceived some notice that sufficiently enabled them to participate in the rulemaking \n   36     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 3 377 o of f4 488\nprocess before the relevant agency adopted the rule.”  Id. (citing cases).  The \nagencies’ actions here are analogous.  No members of the public received notice of \nthe IFRs or were able to comment prior to their effective dates. \nAppellants argue that the states “were afforded multiple opportunities to \ncomment on the scope of the exemption and accommodation during multiple \nrounds of rulemaking.”  These “opportunities” refer to public comment on prior \nrules regarding the religious exemption and accommodation.  Appellants’ \nargument does not convince us.  As previously discussed, those prior rules were \nmaterially different from the IFRs here, which dramatically expanded the scope of \nthe religious exemption and introduced a moral exemption that was not the subject \nof any previous round of notice and comment rulemaking.  The public had no such \nnotice or opportunity to comment on these potential changes, thus denying it the \nsafeguards of the notice and comment procedure.  This denial is comparable to \nfailing to provide prior notice and comment before finalizing a rule that is not a \n“logical outgrowth” of the proposed rule, which an agency may not do without \nconsidering “whether a new round of notice and comment would provide the first \nopportunity for interested parties to offer comments that could persuade the agency \nto modify its rule.”  NRDC v. EPA, 279 F.3d 1180, 1186 (9th Cir. 2002) (citation \nomitted); see also CSX Transp., Inc. v. Surface Transp. Bd., 584 F.3d 1076, 1081 \n(D.C.

There is no such requirement for \nharmless error analysis.  The agencies also argue that the states had an opportunity \nto comment on the IFRs post-issuance and that the agencies will consider the \ncomments before issuing final rules.  This argument also fails.  “The key word in \nthe title ‘Interim Final Rule’ . . . is not interim, but final.  ‘Interim’ refers only to \nthe Rule’s intended duration—not its tentative nature.”  Career Coll. Ass’n v. \nRiley, 74 F.3d 1265, 1268 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  We reiterate that “an opportunity to \nprotest an already-effective rule” does not render an APA violation harmless.  \nPaulsen, 413 F.3d at 1007 (emphasis added).   \nAccordingly, bypassing notice and comment likely was not harmless. \n2. \nA plaintiff seeking preliminary relief must “demonstrate that irreparable \ninjury is likely in the absence of an injunction.”  Winter, 555 U.S. at 22 (emphasis \nomitted).  The analysis focuses on irreparability, “irrespective of the magnitude of \nthe injury.”  Simula, Inc. v. Autoliv, Inc., 175 F.3d 716, 725 (9th Cir. 1999).   \nThe district court concluded that the states are likely to suffer irreparable \nharm absent an injunction.  This decision was not an abuse of discretion.  As \n   38     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 3 399 o of f4 488\ndiscussed in our standing analysis, it is reasonably probable that the states will \nsuffer economic harm from the IFRs.  Economic harm is not normally considered \nirreparable.  L.A. Mem’l Coliseum Comm’n v. Nat'l Football League, 634 F.2d \n1197, 1202 (9th Cir. 1980).  However, such harm is irreparable here because the \nstates will not be able to recover monetary damages connected to the IFRs.  See 5 \nU.S.C. § 702 (permitting relief “other than money damages”); see also Cottonwood \nEnvtl. Law Ctr. v. U.S. Forest Serv., 789 F.3d 1075, 1091 (9th Cir. 2015) \n(reaffirming that the harm flowing from a procedural violation can be irreparable).  \nThat the states promptly filed an action following the issuance of the IFRs also \nweighs in their favor.  Cf. Oakland Tribune, Inc. v. Chronicle Publ’g Co., Inc., 762 \nF.2d 1374, 1377 (9th Cir. 1985) (“Plaintiff’s long delay before seeking a \npreliminary injunction implies a lack of urgency and irreparable harm”).  \n Again, appellants argue that the economic harm is speculative, which “does \nnot constitute irreparable injury sufficient to warrant granting a preliminary \ninjunction.”  See Boardman v. Pac. Seafood Grp., 822 F.3d 1011, 1022 (9th Cir. \n2016) (citation omitted).  As we previously explained in our analysis of standing, \nthe harm is not speculative; it is sufficiently concrete and supported by the record.  \nAppellants also dispute the factual findings underlying the district court’s holding \nof irreparable harm, but again fail to explain how the district court erred under our \nstandard of review. \n   39     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 4 400 o of f4 488\n3. \nBecause the government is a party, we consider the balance of equities and \nthe public interest together.  Jewell, 747 F.3d at 1092.   \nThe IFRs are an attempt to balance states’ interest in “ensuring coverage for \ncontraceptive and sterilization services” with appellants’ interest in “provid[ing] \nconscience protections for individuals and entities with sincerely held religious [or \nmoral] beliefs in certain health care contexts.”  82 Fed. Reg. at 47,793.  The district \ncourt concluded that the balance of equities and the public interest tip in favor of \ngranting the preliminary injunction.  The district court did not abuse its discretion.   \nThe public interest is served by compliance with the APA:  “The APA \ncreates a statutory scheme for informal or notice-and-comment rulemaking \nreflecting a judgment by Congress that the public interest is served by a careful and \nopen review of proposed administrative rules and regulations.” Alcaraz, 746 F.2d \nat 610 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  It does not matter that \nnotice and comment could have changed the substantive result; the public interest \nis served from proper process itself.  Cf. Citizens for Better Forestry, 341 F.3d at \n976 (stating, in standing context, that “[i]t suffices that the agency’s decision could \nbe influenced” by public participation (alterations and citation removed) (emphasis \nin original)).  The district court additionally found that the states face “potentially \ndire public health and fiscal consequences as a result of a process as to which they \n   40     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 4 411 o of f4 488\nhad no input” and highlighted the public interest in access to contraceptive care.  \nThis finding is sufficiently supported by the record. \nWe acknowledge that free exercise of religion and conscience is \nundoubtedly, fundamentally important.  Regardless of whether the accommodation \nviolates RFRA, some employers have sincerely-held religious and moral \nobjections to the contraceptive coverage requirement.  Cf. Jolly v. Coughlin, 76 \nF.3d 468, 482 (2d Cir. 1996) (“[A]lthough the plaintiff’s free exercise claim is \nstatutory rather than constitutional, the denial of the plaintiff’s right to the free \nexercise of his religious beliefs is a harm that cannot be adequately compensated \nmonetarily”).  Protecting religious liberty and conscience is obviously in the public \ninterest.  However, balancing the equities is not an exact science.  See also \nYoungstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 609 (1952) (Frankfurter, \nJ., concurring) (“Balancing the equities . . . is lawyers’ jargon for choosing \nbetween conflicting public interests”).  We do not have a sufficient basis to second \nguess the district court and to conclude that its decision was illogical, implausible, \nor without support in the record.  Finalizing that issue must await any appeal from \nthe district court’s future determination of whether to issue a permanent injunction. \nE. \nThe district court enjoined enforcement of the IFRs nationwide because the \nagencies “did not violate the APA just as to Plaintiffs: no member of the public \n   41     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 4 422 o of f4 488\nwas permitted to participate in the rulemaking process via advance notice and \ncomment.”  The district court abused its discretion in granting a nationwide \ninjunction.  See Stormans, Inc. v. Selecky, 586 F.3d 1109, 1140 (9th Cir. 2009) \n(“[A]n overbroad injunction is an abuse of discretion” (quoting Lamb-Weston, Inc. \nv. McCain Foods, Ltd., 941 F.2d 970, 974 (9th Cir. 1991)).  We vacate the portion \nof the injunction barring enforcement of the IFRs in non-plaintiff states. \nCrafting a preliminary injunction is “an exercise of discretion and judgment, \noften dependent as much on the equities of a given case as the substance of the \nlegal issues it presents.”  Trump v. Int’l Refugee Assistance Project, 137 S. Ct. \n2080, 2087 (2017).  “The purpose of such interim equitable relief is not to \nconclusively determine the rights of the parties but to balance the equities as the \nlitigation moves forward.”  Id. (citation omitted).  Although “there is no bar against \n. . . nationwide relief in federal district court or circuit court,” such broad relief \nmust be “necessary to give prevailing parties the relief to which they are entitled.”  \nBresgal v. Brock, 843 F.2d 1163, 1170–71 (9th Cir. 1987) (emphasis in original \nremoved in part); see also Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702 (1979) \n(“[I]njunctive relief should be no more burdensome to the defendant than \nnecessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs” before the court).

Hannigan, 92 F.3d 1486, 1501 (9th Cir. 1996) \n(“[I]njunctive relief generally should be limited to apply only to named plaintiffs \nwhere there is no class certification”). \n  Before we examine the scope of the injunction here, we highlight several \nconcerns associated with overbroad injunctions, particularly nationwide ones.  Our \nconcerns underscore the exercise of prudence before issuing such an injunction.  \nFirst, “nationwide injunctive relief may be inappropriate where a regulatory \nchallenge involves important or difficult questions of law, which might benefit \nfrom development in different factual contexts and in multiple decisions by the \nvarious courts of appeals.”  L.A. Haven Hospice, Inc. v. Sebelius, 638 F.3d 644, \n664 (9th Cir. 2011).  The Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized that \nnationwide injunctions have detrimental consequences to the development of law \nand deprive appellate courts of a wider range of perspectives.  See Califano, 442 \nU.S. at 702 (highlighting that nationwide injunctions “have a detrimental effect by \nforeclosing adjudication by a number of different courts and judges”); United \nStates v. Mendoza, 464 U.S. 154, 160 (1984) (concluding that allowing nonmutual \n                                           \n7 Indeed, Congress has recently proposed a bill that would prohibit injunctions \ninvolving non-parties “unless the non-party is represented by a party acting in a \nrepresentative capacity pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.”  H.R. \n6730, 115th Cong. (2018) \n   43     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 4 444 o of f4 488\ncollateral estoppel against the government would “substantially thwart the \ndevelopment of important questions of law by freezing the first final decision \nrendered on a particular legal issue” and “deprive [the Supreme] Court of the \nbenefit it receives from permitting several courts of appeals to explore a difficult \nquestion before [the Supreme] Court grants certiorari”); Arizona v. Evans, 514 U.S. \n1, 23 n.1 (1995) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (“We have in many instances recognized \nthat when frontier legal problems are presented, periods of ‘percolation’ in, and \ndiverse opinions from, state and federal appellate courts may yield a better \ninformed and more enduring final pronouncement by this Court”). \n  The detrimental consequences of a nationwide injunction are not limited to \ntheir effects on judicial decisionmaking.  There are also the equities of non-parties \nwho are deprived the right to litigate in other forums.  See Zayn \nSiddique, Nationwide Injunctions, 117 COLUM. L. REV. 2095, 2125 (2017) (“A \nplaintiff may be correct that a particular agency action is unlawful or unduly \nburdensome, but remedying this harm with an overbroad injunction can cause \nserious harm to nonparties who had no opportunity to argue for more limited \nrelief”).  Short of intervening in a case, non-parties are essentially deprived of their \nability to participate, and these collateral consequences are not minimal.  \nNationwide injunctions are also associated with forum shopping, which hinders the \nequitable administration of laws.  See Samuel L. Bray, Multiple Chancellors: \n   44     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 4 455 o of f4 488\nReforming the National Injunction, 131 HARV. L. REV. 417, 458-59 (2017) (citing \nfive nationwide injunctions issued by Texas district courts in just over a year).   \nThese consequences are magnified where, as here, the district court stays \nany effort to prepare the case for trial pending the appeal of a nationwide \npreliminary injunction.  We have repeatedly admonished district courts not to \ndelay trial preparation to await an interim ruling on a preliminary injunction. See, \ne.g., Melendres v. Arpaio, 695 F.3d 990, 1002–03 (9th Cir. 2012); Global \nHorizons, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Labor, 510 F.3d 1054, 1058 (9th Cir. 2007).  \n“Because of the limited scope of our review of the law applied by the district court \nand because the fully developed factual record may be materially different from \nthat initially before the district court, our disposition of appeals from most \npreliminary injunctions may provide little guidance as to the appropriate \ndisposition on the merits.”  Id. at 1003 (quoting Sports Form, Inc. v. United Press \nInt’l, Inc., 686 F.2d 750, 753 (9th Cir. 1982)).  The district court here failed to give \nany particular reason for the stay,8 and this case could have well proceeded to a \ndisposition on the merits without the delay in processing the interlocutory appeal.  \n\"Given the purported urgency of\" implementing the IFRs, the agencies and \nintervenors might “have been better served to pursue aggressively” its defense of \n                                           \n8 The district court stayed the case pending the outcome of this appeal based on the \nparties’ stipulation.  The order staying the case provides no other justification or \nanalysis supporting the stay. \n   45     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 4 466 o of f4 488\nthe IFRs in the district court, “rather than apparently awaiting the outcome of this \nappeal.”  Global Horizons, 510 F.3d at 1058. \n  In light of these concerns, we now address the preliminary injunction issued \nhere.  The scope of the remedy must be no broader and no narrower than necessary \nto redress the injury shown by the plaintiff states.  The plaintiff states argue that \ncomplete relief to them would require enjoining the IFRs in all of their applications \nnationwide.  That is not necessarily the case.  See L.A. Haven Hospice, 638 F.3d at \n665 (vacating the nationwide portion of an injunction barring the enforcement of a \nfacially invalid regulation); City & Cty. of San Francisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, \n1244–45 (9th Cir. 2018) (vacating nationwide portion of injunction barring \nenforcement of executive order).  The scope of an injunction is “dependent as \nmuch on the equities of a given case as the substance of the legal issues it \npresents,” and courts must tailor the scope “to meet the exigencies of the particular \ncase.”  Int’l Refugee Assistance Project, 137 S. Ct. at 2087 (citations omitted).  The \ncircumstances of this case dictate a narrower scope. \nOn the present record, an injunction that applies only to the plaintiff states \nwould provide complete relief to them.  It would prevent the economic harm \nextensively detailed in the record.  Indeed, while the record before the district court \nwas voluminous on the harm to the plaintiffs, it was not developed as to the \neconomic impact on other states.  See City & Cty. of San Francisco, 897 F.3d at \n   46     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 4 477 o of f4 488\n1231, 1244–45 (holding that the district court abused its discretion in issuing a \nnationwide injunction because the plaintiffs’ “tendered evidence is limited to the \neffect of the Order on their governments and the State of California” and because \n“the record is not sufficiently developed on the nationwide impact of the Executive \nOrder”).  The injunction must be narrowed to redress only the injury shown as to \nthe plaintiff states.9 \n  Accordingly, we conclude that the scope of the preliminary injunction is \noverbroad and that the district court abused its discretion in that regard.  District \njudges must require a showing of nationwide impact or sufficient similarity to the \nplaintiff states to foreclose litigation in other districts, from Alaska to Puerto Rico \nto Maine to Guam. \nIV. \n  We affirm that venue is proper in the Northern District of California.  We \naffirm that the plaintiff states have standing to sue.  Although we affirm the \npreliminary injunction, the record does not support the injunction’s nationwide \nscope.  We vacate the portion of the injunction barring enforcement of the IFRs in \nother states and remand to the district court.  This panel will retain jurisdiction for \n                                           \n9 Appellants did not clearly raise other arguments in support of a narrower \ninjunction, including the potential for “substantial interference with another court’s \nsovereignty,” United States v. AMC Entm’t, Inc., 549 F.3d 760, 770 (9th Cir. \n2008), and the lack of need for courts to apply the law uniformly.  Accordingly, we \ndo not address them. \n   47     \n\n  CCaassee :4 1:187-1-c5v1-4045,7 1823/-1H3S/2G0 1  8D, oIDcu: m11e1n1t 9156254  ,  FDilketdE n1t2ry/1: 31/3168- 1  ,P Paaggee 4 488 o of f4 488\nany subsequent appeals arising from this case.

Nos. 312, 353 \n10  HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, et \nal., \n11 \nDefendants.   \na  12     \ntr in\nuoro 13  In this case, a coalition of thirteen states and the District of Columbia (collectively, \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  “States” or “Plaintiff States”) brought challenges to interim final rules and final rules (collectively, \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  the “Rules”) promulgated by federal agencies that create religious and moral exemptions to the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  contraceptive mandate contained within the Affordable Care Act.  See Second Amended \nS de nre 17  Complaint, Dkt. No. 170.1  In January, the Court preliminarily enjoined implementation of the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Rules within the Plaintiff States.  See Dkt. No. 234.  A few weeks later, the Court allowed Oregon \n19  to join the multi-state coalition, Dkt. No. 274, and now Oregon seeks to expand the geographic \n20  scope of the preliminary injunction to prevent the Rules from being implemented in Oregon \n21  pending a resolution on the merits.  See Motion for Preliminary Injunction (“Mot.”), Dkt. No. 312.  \n22  The Court finds that the requested extension is warranted and therefore GRANTS Oregon’s \n23  motion for a preliminary injunction.2 \n24 \n                                                 \n1 Federal Defendants in this case are Alex M.

BACKGROUND \n1 \nThe Court recounted the extensive statutory, regulatory, and judicial background to this \n2 \ncase in its January 13, 2019 order granting Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction and \n3 \nincorporates that summary by reference here.  See Dkt. No. 234 at 2–15.    \n4 \nSince the Court granted preliminary relief in the Plaintiff States, Oregon filed its \n5 \ncomplaint-in-intervention, alleging the injuries that it predicts the state (and its citizens) will \n6 \nsustain if the Rules were to be implemented in Oregon.  See Dkt. No. 287 (“Compl.”).  Oregon \n7 \nalleges that if the Rules go into effect, women who lose their entitlement to free contraceptives \n8 \nwill turn to Oregon’s ContraceptiveCare and Reproductive Health Equity Act programs, thereby \n9 \nincreasing costs to the state.  See Compl. ¶¶ 18–19, 22; see also Declaration of Helene Rimberg \n10 \n(“Rimberg Decl.”), Dkt. No. 211 ¶ 7.  And Oregon predicts that some women who lose \n11 \ncontraceptive coverage because of the Rules may forgo contraceptive use entirely and \n12 \na \ntr in unintentionally become pregnant, which could impose costs on the state’s Medicaid program.  \nuoro 13 \nC tfila Compl. ¶¶ 22–23; see also Rimberg Decl. ¶ 7–9.  Oregon alleges that it expects at least one in-\ncC 14 \ni\nrts fo state employer—Hobby Lobby, which has five stores in Oregon—to invoke the exemption if it \niD tc 15 \n sir goes into effect.  Compl. ¶ 24. \net\ntatsiD 16 \nS d nr In its motion, Oregon concedes that granting an injunction would not have any immediate \nee 17 \nth\nintr effect because Federal Defendants are currently enjoined from implementing the Rules nationwide \nUo\nN 18 \nbased on the district court’s order in Pennsylvania v. Trump, 351 F. Supp. 3d 791, 835 (E.D. Pa. \n19 \n2019).  However, Oregon contends that because the Pennsylvania injunction is “subject to \n20 \nappellate review and attack for its scope,” there is an “imminent risk that the nationwide injunction \n21 \ncould be lifted and thousands of Oregonian women left without contraceptive coverage.”  Mot. at \n22 \n8.   \n23 \nFederal Defendants and Defendant-Intervenors March for Life opposed the extension of \n24 \nthe preliminary injunction.  See Dkt. Nos. 361 (“Fed. Opp.”), 359 (“March Opp.”).  Oregon \n25 \nreplied.  See Dkt. No. 365 (“Reply”). \n26 \n27 \n                                                 \npreliminary injunction and finds that a hearing is not necessary, Oregon’s request to shorten time \n28 \nis DENIED AS MOOT. \n2 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 387   Filed 07/02/19   Page 3 of 6\n \nII.  LEGAL STANDARD \n1 \n“A plaintiff seeking preliminary injunctive relief must establish that [it] is likely to succeed \n2 \non the merits, that [it] is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that \n3 \nthe balance of equities tips in [its] favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.”  Winter v. \n4 \nNat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008).  Alternatively, an injunction may issue where \n5 \n“the likelihood of success is such that serious questions going to the merits were raised and the \n6 \nbalance of hardships tips sharply in [the plaintiff’s] favor,” provided that the plaintiff can also \n7 \ndemonstrate the other two Winter factors.  All. for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, \n8 \n1131–32 (9th Cir. 2011) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  Under either standard, \n9 \nthe plaintiff bears the burden of making a clear showing that it is entitled to this extraordinary \n10 \nremedy.  Earth Island Inst. v. Carlton, 626 F.3d 462, 469 (9th Cir. 2010). \n11 \nIII.  DISCUSSION \n12 \na \ntr in The Court previously concluded that the Plaintiff States were entitled to a preliminary \nuoro 13 \nC tfila injunction because they had shown that: they were likely to succeed (or had at least raised serious \ncC 14 \ni\nrts fo questions going to the merits) on their claim that the Rules violated the Affordable Care Act, they \niD tc 15 \n sir would suffer irreparable harm absent preliminary relief, the balance of hardships tipped sharply in \net\ntatsiD 16 \nS d nr their favor, and the public interest favored injunctive relief.  See Dkt. No. 234 at 21.  Because the \nee 17 \nth\nintr Court finds that there have not been any subsequent developments that would alter its analysis as \nUo\nN 18 \nto the likelihood of success, balance of the hardships, and public interest factors, the Court \n19 \nincorporates by reference its prior discussion of these factors.  See id. at 21–39, 40–42. \n20 \nThat leaves irreparable harm.  Oregon contends that “[i]f the nationwide injunction is \n21 \nlifted, the Rules will inflict irreparable harm.”  Mot. at 28.  According to Oregon, the Rules will \n22 \nlikely cause unintended pregnancies to rise and women to turn to state family planning programs, \n23 \nimposing unrecoverable costs on the state.  Id. at 28–30.  Federal Defendants respond that Oregon \n24 \nhas not established irreparable injury because of the pre-existing nationwide injunction and its \n25 \ndelay in moving for a preliminary injunction.  See Fed. Opp. at 11–13.  The Court considers each \n26 \nof Federal Defendants’ arguments in turn. \n27 \n28 \n3 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 387   Filed 07/02/19   Page 4 of 6\n \nA.  Nationwide Injunction \n1 \nFederal Defendants contend that this Court should not “enter a duplicative injunction” with \n2 \nthe one issued by the district court in Pennsylvania.  Fed. Opp. at 11.  Federal Defendants cite to \n3 \nHawai’i v. Trump, in which a district court granted the government’s motion for an emergency \n4 \nstay pending an appeal in a similar case in the same circuit and noted that a parallel “nationwide \n5 \ninjunction already provides [Hawai’i] with the comprehensive relief it seeks in this lawsuit.”  233 \n6 \nF. Supp. 3d 850, 853 (D. Haw. 2017).  However, this example is belied by the fact that the district \n7 \ncourt later issued a preliminary injunction that overlapped with one issued by a Maryland district \n8 \ncourt.  See State v. Trump, 265 F. Supp. 3d 1140, 1146 (D. Haw. 2017).3  Moreover, overlapping \n9 \ninjunctions appear to be a common outcome of parallel litigation, rather than a reason for the \n10 \nCourt to pass on exercising its duty to determine whether litigants are entitled to relief.  For \n11 \nexample, in recent litigation challenging the Secretary of Commerce’s decision to add a \n12 \na \ntr in citizenship question to the census, three district courts issued parallel injunctions against the \nuoro 13 \nC tfila policy.  See New York v. United States Dep’t of Commerce, 351 F. Supp. 3d 502, 677 (S.D.N.Y. \ncC 14 \ni\nrts fo 2019)4; State v. Ross, 358 F. Supp. 3d 965, 1050–51 (N.D. Cal. 2019); Kravitz v. United States \niD tc 15 \n sir Dep’t of Commerce, 366 F. Supp. 3d 681, 755 (D. Md. 2019).  The Court concludes that the \net\ntatsiD 16 \nS d nr existence of another injunction—particularly one in a different circuit that could be overturned or \nee 17 \nth\nintr limited at any time—does not negate Oregon’s claimed irreparable harm. \nUo\nN 18 \nFederal Defendants also assert that because Oregon’s asserted injury “is expressly \n19 \ncontingent on a future event,” it is “not an imminent, irreparable injury.”  Fed. Opp. at 11.  Federal \n20 \nDefendants cite to In re Excel Innovations, Inc., in which the Ninth Circuit noted that \n21 \n“[s]peculative injury cannot be the basis for a finding of irreparable harm.”  502 F.3d 1086, 1098 \n22 \n(9th Cir. 2007).  There, the Ninth Circuit overturned the bankruptcy court’s preliminary injunction \n23 \nstaying arbitration proceedings between two non-bankrupt parties, partly because the lower court \n24 \n                                                 \n25 \n3 The Supreme Court later stayed enforcement of the preliminary injunctions as to specific groups, \nTrump v. Int’l Refugee Assistance Project, 137 S. Ct. 2080, 2089 (2017), before determining on \n26 \nthe merits that the challenged policies were lawful and reversing the granted preliminary \ninjunctions, Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392, 2423 (2018). \n27 \n4 The Supreme Court recently affirmed in part and reversed in part the district court’s judgment \nand remanded the case for further proceedings but did not discuss the injunction.  See Dep’t of \n28 \nCommerce v. New York, No. 18-966 (U.S. June 27, 2019). \n4 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 387   Filed 07/02/19   Page 5 of 6\n \n1  had speculated when it cited the potential for inconsistent judgments as a basis for the injunction.  \n2  Id. at 1089, 1098.  But Oregon’s asserted injury, although contingent on the nationwide injunction \n3  in Pennsylvania being dissolved, is not speculative.  For the same reasons as the Court found in its \n4  order granting preliminary relief to the Plaintiff States, Oregon is likely to suffer irreparable harm \n5  if the Rules go into effect.  See Dkt. No. 234 at 39; see also California v. Azar, 911 F.3d 558, 571 \n6  (9th Cir. 2018) (holding for standing purposes that the States “show, with reasonable probability, \n7  that the [interim final rules] will first lead to women losing employer-sponsored contraceptive \n8  coverage, which will then result in economic harm to the states”).  And Oregon’s injury is \n9  sufficiently imminent because though the Rules are currently enjoined, the Third Circuit could \n10  alter the injunction at any moment.  By way of example, the Ninth Circuit has upheld preliminary \n11  relief to preserve the status quo where defendants could terminate an agreement with 60-days’ \n12  notice, which would result in the plaintiffs suffering “irreparable harm before a trial on the merits \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  could be held.”  Boardman v. Pac. Seafood Grp., 822 F.3d 1011, 1023 (9th Cir. 2016) (citing \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Winter, 555 U.S. at 22).  Were Oregon to no longer be covered by the Pennsylvania injunction, it \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  could sustain irreparable harm immediately, before the Court could decide the merits of its claims. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Accordingly, because of the routine basis upon which federal courts grant parallel \nS d nr\nee 17  injunctions and the immediacy of the harm were the nationwide injunction to be lifted, the Court \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  finds that these arguments do not preclude granting a preliminary injunction. \n19  B.  Delay \n20  Federal Defendants argue that Oregon’s five-month delay in seeking a preliminary \n21  injunction warrants denying its motion.  Fed. Opp. at 12.  The Court does not find this fact \n22  determinative. \n23  A plaintiff’s delay may “undercut” its claim of irreparable harm.  Garcia v. Google, Inc., \n24  786 F.3d 733, 746 (9th Cir. 2015); see also Oakland Tribune, Inc. v. Chronicle Pub. Co., 762 F.2d \n25  1374, 1377 (9th Cir. 1985) (noting that a “long delay before seeking a preliminary injunction \n26  implies a lack of urgency and irreparable harm”).  “By sleeping on its rights a plaintiff \n27  demonstrates the lack of need for speedy action.”  Lydo Enters., Inc. v. City of Las Vegas, 745 \n28  F.2d 1211, 1213 (9th Cir. 1984) (internal quotation omitted).  However, “delay is but a single \n5 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 387   Filed 07/02/19   Page 6 of 6\n \n1  factor to consider” and “courts are ‘loath to withhold relief solely on that ground.’”  Arc of Cal. v. \n2  Douglas, 757 F.3d 975, 990 (9th Cir. 2014) (quoting Lydo, 745 F.2d at 1214). \n3  The Court finds Oregon’s delay to be minimal and not a basis for denying preliminary \n4  relief.  The Final Rules were promulgated on November 15, 2018, and were slated to take effect \n5  on January 14, 2019.  See Dkt. No. 234 at 13.  Oregon moved to intervene on January 7, Dkt. No. \n6  210, requested joinder in the motion for preliminary injunction on February 21 (which the Court \n7  denied as procedurally improper), Dkt. No. 288, and moved for a preliminary injunction on April \n8  30, Dkt. No. 312.  To be sure, Oregon’s challenge to the Rules has not been as swift as those of \n9  the Plaintiff States.  But this slower pace is at least somewhat explained by the Pennsylvania \n10  injunction, which has prevented Oregon from suffering any harm from the Rules.  Oregon \n11  partially explains the timing of its motion by noting that the Third Circuit recently heard oral \n12  arguments in Pennsylvania, which creates a “renewed risk of irreparable harm.”  Reply at 8.  And \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Oregon has requested expedited consideration of its motion, which supports its argument that \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  preliminary relief is needed.  See Dkt. No. 353.  In sum, although Oregon has not prosecuted this \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  case as quickly as the Plaintiff States, it also has not slept on its rights, and the Court would be \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  loath to deny relief solely on the basis of a few months’ delay, particularly given the overlapping \nS d nr\nee 17  injunction. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  IV.  CONCLUSION \n19  The Court finds that the State of Oregon has satisfied the requirements for a preliminary \n20  injunction and thus GRANTS its motion in order to preserve the status quo pending a final \n21  determination on the merits.  The order enjoining enforcement of the Rules, Dkt. No. 234, is \n22  hereby EXTENDED to cover the State of Oregon. \n23  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n24  Dated: 7/2/19 \n25  ______________________________________ \nHAYWOOD S.

TBD) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05783   Document 1   Filed 10/06/17   Page 2 of 19\n1  INTRODUCTION \n2  1.  Ensuring women access to preventive health care, including contraception, is a key \n3  element in shaping women's overall health and well-being, and is therefore a critical component \n4  of the State's public health programs.  Contraceptives are among the most widely used medical \n5  services in the United States and are much less costly than maternal deliveries for patients, \n6  insurers, employers and states, and consequently the use of contraceptives has been shown to \n7  result in net savings to women and their employers.  Starting in 2012, as part of the Patient \n8  Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), most group health insurance plans had to cover all \n9  Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved contraceptive methods without cost-sharing for \n10  beneficiaries.  45 C.P.R.§ 147.l30(a)(l)(iv); 29 C.P.R.§ 2590.715-2713(a)(l)(iv); 26 C.P.R. \n11  § 54.9815-2713(a)(l)(iv).  Since this contraceptive-coverage requirement took effect, women \n12  have saved $1.4 billion. \n13  2.  On October 6, 2017, the U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS), in conjunction with \n14  the U.S. Depmiment of Labor and U.S. Department of the Treasury, issued two illegal interim \n15  final rules (IFRs), 2017-21851 and 2017-21852.  The IFRs drastically change access to \n16  contraceptive coverage by expanding the scope of the religious exemption to, among other things, \n17  allow any employer or health insurer with religious or moral objections to opt out of the \n18  contraceptive-coverage requirement with no assurances that the federal government will provide \n19  critical oversight to ensure coverage.  Unlike the prior regulations, the IFRs guarantee that there is \n20  no longer an automatic seamless mechanism for women to continue to receive contraceptive \n21  coverage if their employer opts out.  Further, under this new regime, there is not even a \n22  requirement that the employer notify the federal government of a decision to stop providing \n23  contraceptive coverage.  Therefore, millions of women in California may be left without access to \n24  contraceptives and counseling and the State will be shouldering that additional fiscal and \n25  administrative burden as women seek access for this coverage tln·ough state-funded programs. \n26  3.  The State of California, by and tln·ough Attorney General Xavier BecetTa, challenges \n27  the illegal IFRs and seeks an injunction to prevent the IFRs from taking effect because the \n28  regulations violate the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Establishment Clause of the First \n2 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (Case no. TBD) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05783   Document 1   Filed 10/06/17   Page 3 of 19\n1  Amendment, and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Furthermore, the \n2  issuance of the IFRs will have immediate and irreparable harm on the State. \n3  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n4  4.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (action arising under the \n5  laws of the United States), 28 U.S. C. § 1361 (action to compel officer or agency to perform duty \n6  owed to Plaintiff), and 5 U.S. C.§§ 701-706 (Administrative Procedure Act).  An actual \n7  controversy exists between the parties within the meaning of28 U.S.C. § 220l(a), and this Court \n8  may grant declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and other relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § § 2201-\n9  2202 and 5 U.S.C. §§ 705-706. \n10  5.  Defendants' issuance of the IFRs on October 6, 2017, constitutes a final agency \n11  action and is therefore judicially reviewable within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure \n12  Act.  5 U.S.C. §§ 704, 706. \n13  6.  Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) because this is a \n14  judicial district in which the State of California resides and this action seeks relief against federal \n[ 5  agencies and officials acting in their official capacities. \n16  INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT \n17  7.  Pursuant to Civil Local Rules 3-5(b) and 3-2( c), there is no basis for assignment of \n18  this action to any particular location or division of this Court. \n19  PARTIES \n20  8.  Plaintiff, the State of California, by and through Attorney General Xavier Becerra, \n21  brings this action.  The Attorney General is the chieflaw enforcement officer of the State and has \n22  the authority to file civil actions in order to protect public rights and interests.  Cal. Const., art. V, \n23  § 13.  This challenge is brought pursuant to the Attorney General's independent constitutional, \n24  statutory, and common law authority to represent the public interest. \n25  9.  The State of California has an interest in ensuring women's health care is both \n26  available and accessible.  Health care is one of the police powers of the States.  California relies \n27  on Defendants' compliance with the procedural and substantive requirements of the APA in order \n28  to obtain timely and accurate inforn1ation about activities that may have significant adverse \n3 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (Case no. TBD) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05783   Document 1   Filed 10/06/17   Page 4 of 19\nI  impacts on access to health care, including contraceptive coverage, and to meaningfully \n2  participate in an impartial and public decision-making process that is consistent with the scope of \n3  the Affordable Care Act's requirements of free contraceptive coverage. \n4  10 .  California is aggrieved by the actions of Defendants and has standing to bring this \n5  action because of the injury to its state sovereignty caused by Defendants' issuance of the illegal \n6  IFRs, including immediate and irreparable injuries to its sovereign, quasi-sovereign, and \n7  proprietary interests.  In particular, California will suffer concrete and substantial harm because \n8  the IFRs frustrate California's public health interests by curtailing women's access to \n9  contraceptive care through employer-sponsored health insurance, and will burden the State with \n10   increased costs of providing contraceptive coverage and costs resulting from unintended \nII  pregnancies.1 \n12  11.  Defendant Don. J. Wright is Acting Secretary ofHHS and is sued in his official \n13  capacity.  Acting Secretary Wright has responsibility for implementing and fulfilling HHS's \n14  duties under the Constitution, the ACA, and the AP A. \n15  12.  Defendant HHS is an agency of the United States government and bears \n16  responsibility, in whole or in part, for the acts complained of in this Complaint.  The Centers for \n17  Medicare and Medicaid Services is an entity within the HHS. \n18  13.  Defendant R. Alexander Acosta is Secretary of the U.S. Department of Labor and is \n19  sued in his official capacity.  Secretary Acosta has responsibility for implementing and fulfilling \n20  the U.S. Department of Labor's duties under the Constitution, the ACA, and the APA. \n21  14.  Defendant U.S. Department of Labor is an agency of the United States government \n22  and bears responsibility, in whole or in part, for the acts complained of in this Complaint.  The \n23  Employee Benefits Security Administration is an entity within the U.S. Department of Labor. \n24  15.  Defendant Steven Mnuchin is Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury and is \n25  sued in his official capacity.  Secretary Mnuchin has responsibility for implementing and \n26 \n1 Though this complaint focuses on how the IFRs target women, the IFRs also may affect \n27  people who do not identify as women, including some gender non-confirming people and some \ntransgender men. \n28 \n4 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (Case no.

Defendant U.S. Department of the Treasury is an agency of the United States \n4  government and bears responsibility, in whole or in part, for the acts complained of in this \n5  Complaint.  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is an entity within the U.S. Department of the \n6  Treasury. \n7 \nSTATUTORY BACKGROUND \n8  I.  THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT \n9  17.  The ACA requires that certain group health insurance plans cover preventive care and \n10  screenings without imposing costs on the employee and his/her covered dependents.  42 U.S.C. \n11  § 300gg-13(a).  Importantly, this includes women's \"preventive cate and screenings ... as \n12  provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services \n13  Administration.\"  42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4).  During the 2009 debates leading up to the ACA's \n14  passage, the United States Congress specifically proposed an amendment to require health plans \n15  to cover comprehensive women's preventive care and screenings.  This amendment, which came \n16  to be called the Women's Health Amendment, relied on guidelines developed by the independent, \n17  nonpartisan Institute of Medicine (IO  M) and adopted by the HHS.  It required coverage for \n18  \"preventive care and screenings\" for women to ensure \"essential protections for women's access \n19  to preventive health care not currently covered in other prevention section of the [A  CA ].\" \n20  18.  The IOM assembled a diverse, expert committee to draft a report to determine what \n21  should be included in cost-free \"preventive care\" coverage for women.  The report underwent \n22  rigorous, independent external review prior to its release. \n23  19.  On or about July 19, 2011, the IOM issued its expert report which included a \n24  comprehensive set of eight evidence-based recommendations for strengthening preventive health \n25  care services.  Specifically, the IOM recommended that private health insurance plans be required \n26  to cover all contraceptive benefits and services approved by the FDA without cost-sharing (also \n27  known as out-of-pocket costs such as deductibles and copays). \n28 \n5 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (Case no. TBD) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05783   Document 1   Filed 10/06/17   Page 6 of 19\nI  20.  These IOM recommendations, developed after an exhaustive review of the medical \n2  and scientific evidence, were intended to fill important gaps in coverage.  The recommendations \n3  include coverage for an mmual well-woman preventive care visit, specific services for pregnant \n4  women and nursing mothers, counseling and screening for HIV and domestic violence, as well as \n5  services for the early detection of reproductive cancers and sexually transmitted infections. \n6  Significantly, the recommendations include coverage of the full range of all FDA-approved \n7  contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for all \n8  women with reproductive capacity.  The IOM acknowledged the reality that cost can be a \n9  daunting barrier for women when it comes to choosing and using the most effective contraceptive \n10  method.  For instance, certain highly-effective contraceptive methods, such as the intrauterine \nII  device and the implant, have high up-front costs, which act as a bmTier to access despite the fact \n12  that these contraceptives are long-acting and 99 percent effective.  The IOM considers these \n13  services essential so that \"women can better avoid unwanted pregnancies and space their \n14  pregnancies to promote optimal birth outcomes.\" \n15  21.  Thus, theiOM recommended that \"preventive care\" include not only contraceptive \n16  coverage such as access to all FDA-approved contraceptives but also counseling and education to \n17  ensure that women were receiving information on the best method for their individual set of \n18  circmnstances. \n19  22.  Following the I OM's recommendations relating to contraceptive coverage, HHS, the \n20  U.S. Department of Labor, and the U.S. Department of the Treasury promulgated regulations \n21  requiring that group health insurance plans cover all FDA-approved contraceptive methods \n22  without cost to women and their covered dependents.  45 C.P.R.§ 147.130(a)(l)(iv); 29 C.P.R. \n23  § 2590.715-2713(a)(l)(iv); 26 C.P.R.§ 54.9815-2713(a)(l)(iv). \n24  23.  In implementing this statutory scheme, HHS made clear that these coverage \n25  requirements were not applicable to group health plans sponsored by religious employers. \n26  Further, HHS made available to health plans a religious accommodation to employers who seek \n27  to not provide this coverage.  Through this religious accommodation, the federal government \n28  ensured that women had access to seamless contraceptive coverage as entitled under the ACA, \n6 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (Case no. TBD) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05783   Document 1   Filed 10/06/17   Page 7 of 19\n1  while also providing employers with a mechanism to opt-out of providing or paying for this \n2  coverage. \n3  24.  In order to effectuate this policy, the Health Resources and Services Administration \n4  (HRSA) issued guidelines implementing the 10M's expert report's recommendations.  These \n5  guidelines ensure that women receive a comprehensive set of preventive services without having \n6  to pay a co-payment, co-insurance, or a deductible. \n7  25.  HRSA's comprehensive guidelines included a list of each type of preventive service, \n8  and the frequency with which that service should be offered.  Under the guidelines, HHS \n9  recognized that well-woman visits should be conducted annually for adult women to obtain the \n10  recommended preventive services that are age- and development-appropriate, including \n11  preconception care and many services necessary for prenatal care.  HSRA recognized that the \n12  well-woman health screening should occur at least on an annual basis, but also noted that several \n13  visits may be needed to obtain all necessary recommended preventive services, depending on a \n14  woman's health status, health needs, and other risk factors.  HRSA's guidelines also included \n15  annual counseling on sexually transmitted infections for all sexually active women, annual \n16  counseling and screeningfor human immunodeficiency virus infection for all sexually active \n17  women, all FDA-approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education \n18  and counseling for all women with reproductive capacity.  These guidelines ensured that women \n19  could access a comprehensive set of preventive services without having to pay a co-payment, co-\n20  insurance, or a deductible to ensure there was no cost barrier. \n21  26.  In March 2016, HRSA awarded a five-year cooperative agreement to the American \n22  Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) to update the women preventive services \n23  guidelines originally recommended by IOM and work to develop additional recommendations to \n24  enhance women's overall health.  In that same month, ACOG launched the \"Women's Preventive \n25  Services Initiative\" (WPSI), which was a multidisciplinary steering committee headed by ACOG \n26  to update the eight 10M recommendations from 2011.  Through this initiative, ACOG partnered \n27  with the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American College of Physicians, and the \n28  National Association of Nurse Practitioners in Women's Health to achieve this goal.  The WPSI \n7 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (Case no. TBD) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05783   Document 1   Filed 10/06/17   Page 8 of 19\n1  issued draft recommendations for public comments in September of 2016 and the updated \n2  \"Women's Preventive Service Guidelines\" were finalized and implemented by HRSA on \n3  December 20,2016 to take effect December 20,2017.  Importantly, these expe1i, evidence-based \n4  medical recommendations continued to include coverage of all FDA-approved contraceptive \n5  methods and counseling for women with reproductive capacity, underscoring their importance to \n6  women. \n7  II.  ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT \n8  27.  Pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S. C.§ 551 et seq., a \n9  reviewing court shall \"(1) compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed; \n10   and (2) hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to \n11  be ... arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, otherwise not in accordance with law; [or] \n12  without observance of procedure required by law.\"  5 U.S. C.§ 706.  The APA defines \"agency \n13  action\" to include \"the whole or a part of an agency rule, order, license, sanction, relief, or the \n14  equivalent or denial thereof, or failure to act.\"  Id. § 551(13) (emphasis added); see id. § 551(6) \n15  (defining \"order\" to mean \"the whole or a part of a final disposition, whether affirmative, \n16  negative, injunctive, or declaratory in form, of an agency in a matter other than rule making but \n17  including licensing\"). \n18  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n19  1.  CONTRACEPTIVE COVERAGE \n20  28.  Contraceptives are among the most widely used medical products in the United \n21  States, with 99 percent of sexually active women having used at least one type of contraception in \n22  her lifetime. By the age of 40, American women have used an average of three or four different \n23  methods (some of which are available only by prescription), after considering their relative \n24  effectiveness, side effects, drug interactions and hormones, the frequency of sexual conduct, \n25  perceived risk of sexually transmitted infections, the desire for control, and a host of other factors. \n26  Of course, women face the possibility of having children for many years of their life and therefore \n27  if a woman only wants two children, for instance, she would need to spend roughly three decades \n28  on birth control to avoid unintended pregnancies.  Due to the positive impact of contraception for \n8 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (Case no. TBD) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05783   Document 1   Filed 10/06/17   Page 9 of 19\nI  women and society, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that family \n2  planning, including access to modern contraception, was one of the ten greatest achievements of \n3  the 20th Century.  Further, one-third of the wage gains women have made since the 1960s are the \n4  result of access to oral contraceptives.  Access to birth control has helped narrow the wage gap \n5  between women and men.  The decrease in the wage gap among 25 to 49-year-olds between \n6  men's and women's annual incomes would have been 10 percent smaller in the 1980s and 30 \n7  percent smaller in the 1990s in the absence of widespread legal birth control access for women. \n8  29.  Contraceptives are much less costly than maternal deliveries for states, insurers, \n9  employers, and patients, and consequently, they have been shown to result in net savings to \nI 0  women and ultimately employers.  The ACA's requirement to cover contraception benefits and \nII  services has saved American women $1.4 billion since the law took effect in 2012.  For instance, \n12  the share of women of reproductive age who had out-of-pocket spending on oral contraceptive \n13  pills fell sharply after the ACA; spending on oral contraceptive pills plummeted from 20.9 \n14  percent in 2012 to 3.6 percent in 2014, corresponding to the timing of the ACA provision.  To \n15  date, over 62.4 million women have benefited fi·om this coverage, including 13 million in \n16  California.  Although both men and women benefit from access to safe and reliable contraceptive \n17  care, women disproportionately bear the cost of obtaining contraceptives.  This is in part because, \n18  of the FDA-approved methods of contraceptives, only two~male sterilization surgery and male \n19  condoms~are available for use by men.  The methods of contraception at issue in this matter are \n20  only available for women. \n21  30.  This savings to women has a corresponding fiscal impact on society, including to the \n22  State of California.  The ACA's contraceptive-coverage requirement decreases the number of \n23  unintended pregnancies, and thereby the costs associated with those pregnancies.  Furthermore, \n24  unintended pregnancy is associated with poor birth outcomes and maternal health issues, and \n25  thus, the contraceptive-coverage requirement also reduces the number of high-costs births and \n26  infants born in poor health. \n27 \n28 \n9 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (Case no. TBD) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05783   Document 1   Filed 10/06/17   Page 10 of 19\nI  31.  In California, 48 percent of all pregnancies were unintended in 20 I 0.  Of those \n2  unplanned pregnancies that resulted in births, 64.3 percent were publicly funded, costing \n3  California $689.3 million on unintended pregnancies. \n4  32.  In 2014, the California Legislature passed the Contraceptive Equity Act of2014 (SB \n5  I 053), which requires certain health plans to cover certain prescribed FDA-approved \n6  contraceptives for women without cost-sharing.  Twenty-seven other states have similar \n7  contraceptive equity laws, aimed at making contraception cheaper and more accessible. \n8  3 3.  In passing the Contraceptive Equity Act, the California Legislature concluded that \n9  providing contraception will result in overall savings in the health care industry due to reduced \nI 0  office visits, reduced unintended pregnancies, and therefore, reduced prenatal care, abortions, and \nII  labor and delivery costs.  In fact, the California Health Benefits Review Program (CHBRP) \n12  anticipated that there would be substantial cost savings, including $213 million in savings to \n13  private employers, $86 million in savings to individuals, and $7 million in savings to CalPERS. \n14  CHBRP also anticipated a cost savings of$56 million for Medi-Calmanaged care.  In addition to \n15  these fiscal benefits, there is huge benefit to California's public health.  CHBRP estimated that \n16  access to and increased contraceptive use under this act would result in 51,298 averted unintended \n17  pregnancies, and among those averted, CHBRP estimated that 20,006 averted abortions. \n18  Moreover, with the decrease in unintended pregnancies and abortions, there is a corresponding \n19  decrease in the risk of maternal mortality, adverse child outcomes, behavior problems in children, \n20  and negative psychological outcomes associated with unintended pregnancies for both mothers \n21  and children.  Significantly, access to contraceptive coverage helps women to delay childbearing \n22  and pursue additional education, spend additional time in their careers, and have increased \n23  earning power over the long-term. \n24  34.  California's Contraceptive Equity Act, however, only applies to state-regulated health \n25  plans.  It does not apply to self-funded health plans, through which 61 percent of covered workers \n26  are insured.  Self-funded health plans are governed by the Federal Employee Retirement Income \n27  Security Act of 1974 and are regulated by the U.S. Department of Labor, Employee Benefits \n28  Security Administration. \n10 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (Case no.

The California Health Care Foundation estimates that as of2015, 6.6 million \n2  Californians were covered by a self-funded employer health plan.  Therefore, the IFRs could \n3  affect over 6 million California women.  These women will be left unprotected and the IFRs \n4  threaten California's ability to guarantee health and welfare to its residents by a virtual denial of \n5  free access to contraceptive coverage to women. \n6  36.  In California, if women do not receive cost-free contraceptive coverage from their \n7  employer, California risks having to absorb the financial and administrative burden of ensuring \n8  access to contraceptive coverage.  Due to the IFRs, California women will be forced to utilize the \n9  state's Family Planning, Access, Care, and Treatment (Family PACT) program provided they \n10  meet certain eligibility requirements.  Family PACT is administered by the Office of Family \n11  Planning (OFP), an entity within the California Department of Health Care Services, which is \n12  charged by the California Legislature to malce available to citizens of the State who are of \n13  childbearing age comprehensive medical knowledge, assistance, and services relating to the \n14  plarming of families.  Family planning allows women to decide for themselves the nun1ber, \n15  timing, and spacing of their children. \n16  37.  Family PACT is available to eligible low-income (under 200 percent of federal \n17  poverty level) men and women who are residents of the California.  Cunently, the program serves \n18  1.1 million eligible men and women of childbearing age through a network of 2,200 public and \n19  private providers.  Services include comprehensive education, assistance, and services relating to \n20  family planning.  These Californians have no other source of health care coverage for family \n21  plarming services (or they meet the criteria specified for eligibility with Other Health Coverage) \n22  and they have a medical necessity for family planning services. \n23  38.  The 2,200 clinic and private practice clinician provider entities enroll women in \n24  Family PACT across the state.  Family PACT clinician providers include private physicians in \n25  nonprofit community-based clinics, obstetricians and gynecologists, general practice physicians, \n26  family practice, internal medicine, and pediatrics.  Medi-Cal licensed phmmacies and laboratories \n27  also participate by refenals from enrolled Family PACT clinicians. \n28 \nII \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (Case no. TBD) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05783   Document 1   Filed 10/06/17   Page 12 of 19\nI  39.  Planned Parenthood is one example of a Family PACT provider that enrolls women \n2  into the program.  Planned Parenthood currently serves approximately 850,000 patients a year \n3  through 115 health centers.  California reimburses Planned Parenthood for family planning \n4  services provided.  For every dollar Planned Parenthood spends on family planning services, the \n5  federal government contributes 77.49 cents while the state spends 22.51 cents. \n6  40.  Because health facilities, including but not limited to Planned Parenthood, will likely \n7  see a spike in patients seeking contraceptive coverage, California will be fiscally impacted \n8  through increased enrollment in Family PACT. \n9 \nII.  PRIOR REGULATORY FRAMEWORK PROVIDING ACA CONTRACEPTIVE-COVERAGE \nREQUIREMENT EXCEPT IN NARROWLY TAILORED CIRCUMSTANCES \n10 \n11  41.  In enacting and implementing the ACA, both Congress and HHS contemplated laws \nprotecting religious exercise.  To that end, the ACA requires no-cost coverage of women's \n12 \npreventive health care, with some narrowly tailored exceptions for those employers that objected \n13 \nto providing their employees with contraceptives.  The two exceptions originally implemented \n14 \nwere for: (1) religious organizations and (2) nonprofits witl1 religious objections.  Specifically, in \n15 \nimplementing the ACA, the regulations permit religious employers such as churches to seek an \n16 \n\"exemption\" from the contraceptive-coverage requirement.  See 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a) (cun·ent \n17 \nHHS regulation).  Nonprofits with religious objections were also allowed to opt out of the \n18 \ncontraceptive-coverage requirement via an \"accommodation,\" by which the nonprofit employer \n19 \n20  certifies its objection and the insurer is then responsible for separate contraceptive coverage. \n42.  Following three rounds of notice-and-comment rulemaking to develop and refine \n21 \nregulations, generating hundreds of thousands of public comments, the federal government \n22 \nenacted this \"accommodation\" which furthers the compelling interest in ensuring that women \n23 \ncovered by every type of health plan receive full and equal healtl1 coverage, including \n24 \ncontraceptive coverage.  At the same time, it ensures that objecting employers are not providing \n25 \n26  this coverage.  Specifically, to obtain the \"accommodation,\" an employer opted out by notifying \nits insurer using a written form certifying its religious objection and eligibility for the \n27 \naccommodation. \n28 \n12 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (Case no. TBD) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05783   Document 1   Filed 10/06/17   Page 13 of 19\n1  43.  This process resulted in a relatively seamless mechanism for women, whose \n2  employers obtain the religious accommodation, to continue to receive their ACA contraceptive \n3  coverage not provided by the employer, and helped the government ensure that no woman was \n4  went without birth control as a result.  See 80 FR 41318 (July 14, 2015) (current HHS regulation); \n5  45 C.P.R. § 147.131(c)-(d) (current HHS regulation).  This scheme ensured that those employees \n6  would not be adversely affected by their employers' decision to opt out.  45 C.P.R. § 147.131(c)-\n7  (d).  At the same time, it likewise ensured that certain employers who had religious objections \n8  could avoid providing for or paying for this coverage.  Thus, this scheme struck a good balance \n9  for both the employer and the employee. \n10  44.  The religious accommodation was later expanded to include certain closely-held for-\n11  profit organizations with religious objections to providing contraceptive care, consistent with the \n12  Supreme Court's decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2751 (2014); 80 FR \n13  41318 (July 14, 2015); 45 C.P.R.§ 147.131(b)(4).  Further, in response to the Supreme Court, an \n14  organization may use an alternative process of providing notice of its religious objections to \n15  providii1g contraceptive services. Instead of filing a form with HHS or sending a copy of the \n16  executed form it its health insurance provider or third party administrator, the non-profit \n17  organization may use m1 alternate process to provide notice of its religious objection.  It may \n18  simply notify HHS in writing of its objection to covering contraceptive coverage.  Wheaton \n19  College v. Burwell, 134 S. Ct. 2806 (2014); 80 FR4131S. \n20  III.  NEW REGULATORY FRAMEWORK VASTLY EXPANDING THE ABILITY OF \nEMPLOYERS TO 0PT-0UT OF PROVIDING COST-FREE CONTRACEPTIVE COVERAGE \n21  UNDER THE ACA \n22 \n45.  Without m1y notice, opportunity to comment, or evidence-based expert guidance, on \n23 \nOctober 6, 2017, Defendants promulgated sweeping new IFRs affecting women's access to cost \n24 \nfree contraceptive coverage.  The IFRs fail to address the fact-finding underlying the prior \n25 \nregulations and rely on insufficient evidence. \n26 \n46.  Prior to promulgating the IFRs, Defendants failed to meet or convene publically any \n27 \nwomen's, medical, or public health organizations that emphasize access to health care.  For \n28 \n13 \nComplaint for Declaratory and injunctive Relief (Case no. TBD) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05783   Document 1   Filed 10/06/17   Page 14 of 19\n1  example, Defendants did not meet with the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American \n2  Association of Family Physicians, the National Association of Nurse Practitioners in Women's \n3  Health, the National Partnership for Women and Families, or the Planned Parenthood Federation \n4  of America, among others.  Instead, Defendants met with organizations like the Heritage \n5  Foundation, Church Alliance, and the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern \n6  Baptist Convention. \n7  47.  The new IFRs vastly expand the scope of entities that may be exempt from the \n8  contraceptive-coverage requirement.  They cast a wide net beyond religious organizations to any \n9  individual, employer or insurer (regardless of corporate structure or religious affiliation), a step \n10  that undermines the federally-backed religious accommodation, which balances the interest of \n11  employers wishing to opt-out of providing contraception for employees while also ensuring \n12  seamless access to care for women.  Further, this exemption has been extended to not only a \n13  religious objection, but also a new moral objection to all or a subset of the contraceptive-coverage \n14  requirement. \n15  48.  The IFRs, thus, expand the Hobby Lobby decision to any business with a moral \n16  objection against providing women access to contraceptive coverage, fmther frustrating the \n17  scheme and purpose of the A CA. \n18  49.  Additionally, under the new IFRs, employers seeking to be exempt from providing \n19  contraceptives do not need to certify any objection to the coverage requirement.  Rather, the \n20  employer can simply inform their employees they will no longer cover contraception benefits and \n21  counseling as part of their employer health care coverage.  This is a significant change.  By \n22  contrast, the prior federal regulations provided a process for women to receive their care as part of \n23  the \"religious accommodation,\" which also ensured that employers who religiously objected to \n24  providing this coverage did not have to provide or pay for contraceptives.  Under the previous \n25  regime, the federal government acted as the guiding entity or the \"back-stop\" to ensure that there \n26  was a balance between the compelling interest that all women have access to their federally \n27  entitled benefit under the ACA, while also creating an accommodation for those employers that \n28  sought not to provide this coverage.  Under the new IFRs there is nothing in place to ensure that \n14 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (Case no. TBD) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05783   Document 1   Filed 10/06/17   Page 15 of 19\n1  women across the country, let alone California, continue to receive this federally entitled \n2  coverage.  Further, these new IFRs create an entirely new \"moral exemption\" standard, which \n3  was not previously contemplated by the federal government.  Employers can simply make use of \n4  a religious or the new moral exemption, without informing the federal government, thereby \n5  almost ensuring that female employees lose access to this federally entitled seamless \n6  contraceptive access as contemplated by the ACA.  Without the federal backstop or guidance over \n7  a federal entitlement, these women will simply be left without contraceptive coverage and with \n8  nowhere to go.  The State of California will be forced to fill this gap. \n9  50.  In short, under the new IFRs, those exempted entities do not need to certify any \nI 0  objection to the contraceptive-coverage requirement to the federal government, which all but \nII  ensure that women across the country will go without birth control access as the ACA intended. \n12  51.  These IFRs could impact 6.6 million Californians who receive their health care \n13  through a self-insured employer health plan, and therefore do not receive the benefit of \n14  California's Contraceptive Equity Act. \n15  52.  There are at least 25 California employers, with 54,879 employees who will likely \n16  seek an exemption or accommodation.  Thus, an unknown but substantial number of California \n17  women will be affected by these IFRs, and under these new IFRs, California anticipates that this \n18  number will vastly expand, eviscerating the ability of these women to access cost-free \n19  contraceptive coverage through their health plan.  Consequently, they will turn to publicly funded \n20  clinics or California's wrap-around family program, Family PACT, to obtain the contraceptive \n21  coverage that is no longer being provided by employers or insurers, or being tracked by the \n22  federal government to ensure women maintain access as envisioned by the A CA. \n23  53.  By promulgating the IFRs, California's concrete interest in ensuring access to \n24  contraceptive coverage is violated. \n25  FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n26  (Violation of AP A; 5 U.S.C. § 553) \n27  54.  Paragraphs I through 53 are realleged and incorporated herein by reference. \n28 \n15 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (Case no. TBD) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05783   Document 1   Filed 10/06/17   Page 16 of 19\n1  55.  The AP A generally requires agencies to provide the public notice and an opportunity \n2  to be heard before promulgating a regulation.  An agency wishing to promulgate a regulation \n3  must publish in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking that includes \"(I) a \n4  statement of the time, place, and nature of public rule making proceedings; (2) reference to the \n5  legal authority under which the rule is proposed; and (3) either the terms or substance of the \n6  proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved.\"  5 U.S.C. § 553(b).  After the \n7  notice has issued, \"the agency shall give interested persons an opportunity to participate in the \n8  rulemaking through submission of written data, views, or arguments with or without opportunity \n9  for oral presentation.\" Jd. § 553(c). \nI 0  56.  In nan-ow circumstances, the AP A exempts agencies from this notice and comment \nII  process where they can show \"good cause\" that the process would be either \"impracticable, \n12  unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.\"  Id. § 553(b)(B).  The burden is on the agency to \n13  demonstrate good cause, and courts have interpreted the exception nan-owly.  See, e.g., Lake \n14  Carriers' Ass'n v. EPA, 652 F.3d I, 6 (D.C. Cir. 2011). \n15  57.  Defendants have not and cannot demonstrate good cause for failing to give any notice \n16  to the public or allowing for public comment prior to effectuating these new IFRs. \n17  58.  Notice and comment is particularly important in legally and factually complex \n18  circumstances like those presented here.  Notice and comment allows affected parties-including \n19  states-to explain the practical effects of a rule before it is implemented, and ensures that the \n20  agency proceeds in a fully informed manner, exploring alternative, less harmful approaches.  In \n21  the area of women's health care, it is particularly important to have an adequate notice and \n22  comment given that women have been relying on this benefit since 2012. \n23  59.  Because Defendants failed to follow section 553's notice and comment procedures, \n24  the regulations are invalid. \n25  SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n26  (Violation of APA; 5 U.S.C. § 706) \n27  60.  Paragraphs I through 59 are realleged and incorporated herein by reference. \n28 \n16 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief(Case no. TBD) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05783   Document 1   Filed 10/06/17   Page 17 of 19\nI  61.  The AP A requires courts to \"hold unlawful and set aside\" agency action that is \n2  \"(A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; \n3  (B) contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity; (C) in excess of statutory \n4  jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.\" \n5  62.  By promulgating theses new IFRs, without proper factual or legal basis, Defendants \n6  have acted arbitrarily and capriciously, have abused their discretion, have acted otherwise not in \n7  accordance with law, and have tal(en unconstitutional and unlawful action in violation of the APA. \n8  Defendants' violation causes ongoing harm to California and its residents. \n9  TlllRD CAUSE OF ACTION \n10  (Violation of the Establishment Clause) \n11  63.  Paragraphs 1 through 62 are realleged and incorporated herein by reference. \n12  64.  The First Amendment provides that \"Congress shall m~e no law respecting an \n13  establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\"  U.S. Canst., amend. I.  \"The \n14  clearest command of the Establishment Clause is that one religious denomination carmot be \n15  officially preferred over another.\"  Larson v.  Valente, 456 U.S. 228,244 (1982); see also \n16  McCreary County, Kentucky v. ACLU, 545 U.S. 844, 875 (2005) (\"the govenunent may not favor \n17  one religion over another, or religion over irreligion\"). \n18  65.  The new IFRs privilege religious beliefs over secular beliefs as a basis for obtaining \n19  exemptions m1der the A CA. \n20  66.  In contrast, the prior regulations only allowed an exemption for churches and an \n21  accommodation for non-profits and closely-held for-profit companies with religious objections. \n22  This was narrowly tailored to accommodate religious beliefs and still provide essential women's \n23  health care services. \n24  67.  By promulgating the new IFRs, Defendants have violated the Establishment Clause \n25  because the new IFRs goes too fm· in accommodating an employer's religious objections to birth \n26  control, placing an undue burden on third parties - the women who seek birth control. \n27 \n28 \n17 \nComplaint for Declaratory and h\\junctive Relief (Case no. TBD) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05783   Document 1   Filed 10/06/17   Page 18 of 19\n1  68.  The new IFRs are not narrowly tailored and ignore the compelling interest of \n2  seamless access to cost-free birth control.  This crosses the line from acceptable accommodation \n3  to religious endorsement. \n· 4  69.  Defendants' violation causes ongoing harm to California residents. \n5  FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n6  (Violation of the Equal Protection Clause) \n7  70.  Paragraphs 1 through 69 are realleged and incorporated herein by reference. \n8  71.  The Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibits the federal \n9  government from denying equal protection of the laws. \n10  72.  The new IFRs, together with statements made by Defendants concerning their intent \n11  and application, target individuals for discriminatory treatment based on their gender, without \n12  lawful justification. \n13  73.  The new IFRs specifically target and harm women.  The ACA specifically \n14  contemplated disparities in health care costs between women and men, and specifically sought to \n15  rectifY this problem by giving women cost-free preventive services.  The new IFRs undermine \n16  this action and is discriminatory to women. \n17  74.  By promulgating the new IFRs, Defendants have violated the equal protection \n18  guarantee of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. \n19  75.  Defendants' violation causes ongoing harm to California residents. \n20  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n21  WHEREFORE, the State of California, by and through Attorney General Xavier Becerra, \n22  respectfully requests that this Court: \n23  1.  Issue a declaratory judgment that the IFRs are void for failing to comply with the notice \n24  and comment requirements of the APA; \n25  2.  Issue a declaratory judgment that the IFRs are an unreasonable interpretation of the law; \n26  3.  Issue a declaratory judgment that the IFRs violate the Establishment Clause; \n27  4.  Issue a declaratory judgment that the IFRs violate the Equal Protection Clause; \n28  5.  Issue a preliminary injunction prohibiting the implementation of the IFRs; \n18 \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief(Case no.

Although much of this background was already recounted in the Court’s prior order, \n19  the Court reiterates it here for the sake of clarity.  See California v. Health & Human Servs., 281 \n20  F. Supp. 3d 806 (N.D. Cal. 2017), aff’d in part, vacated in part, remanded sub nom. California v. \n21  Azar, 911 F.3d 558 (9th Cir. 2018). \n22  A.  The Affordable Care Act \n23  In March 2010, Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act. The ACA included a provision \n24  known as the Women’s Health Amendment, which states: \nA group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or \n25  individual health insurance coverage shall, at a minimum provide \ncoverage for and shall not impose any cost sharing requirements for  \n26  . . . with respect to women, such additional preventive care and \nscreenings . . . as provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported \n27  by the Health Resources and Services Administration for purposes of \nthis paragraph. \n28 \n2 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 3 of 45\n \n1  42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4).   \n2    About two years later, the Senate rejected a so-called “conscience amendment” to the \n3  Women’s Health Amendment that would have allowed health plans to decline to provide coverage \n4  “contrary to” an insurer or employer’s asserted “religious beliefs or moral convictions.”  See 158 \n5  Cong. Rec. S538–39 (Feb. 9, 2012) (text of proposed bill); id. S1162–73 (Mar. 1, 2012) (debate \n6  and vote); see also Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2751, 2789–90 (2014) \n7  (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (recognizing that rejection of the “conscience amendment” meant that \n8  “Congress left health care decisions—including the choice among contraceptive methods—in the \n9  hands of women, with the aid of their health care providers”). \n10  B.  The 2010 IFR and Subsequent Regulations  \n11  On July 19, 2010, under the authority of the Women’s Health Amendment, several federal \n12  agencies (including HHS, the Department of Labor, and the Department of the Treasury) issued an \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  interim final rule (“the 2010 IFR”).  See 75 Fed. Reg. 41,726.  It required, in part, that health plans \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  provide “evidence-informed preventive care” to women, without cost sharing and in compliance \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  with “comprehensive guidelines” to be provided by HHS’s Health Resources and Services \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Administration (“HRSA”).  Id. at 41,728. \nS d nr\nee 17  The agencies found they had statutory authority “to promulgate any interim final rules that \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  they determine[d were] appropriate to carry out the” relevant statutory provisions.  Id. at 41,729–\n19  30.  The agencies also determined they had good cause to forgo the general notice of proposed \n20  rulemaking required under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 553.  Id. at \n21  41,730.  Specifically, the agencies determined that issuing such notice would be “impracticable \n22  and contrary to the public interest” because it would not allow sufficient time for health plans to \n23  be timely designed to incorporate the new requirements under the ACA, which were set to go into \n24  effect approximately two months later.  Id.  The agencies requested that comments be submitted \n25  by September 17, 2010, the date the IFR was scheduled to go into effect. \n26  On September 17, 2010, the agencies first promulgated regulations pursuant to the 2010 \n27  IFR.  See 45 C.F.R. § 147.310(a)(1)(iv) (HHS); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713 (Department of \n28 \n3 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 4 of 45\n \n1  Labor); 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713 (Department of the Treasury).2  As relevant here, the \n2  regulations were substantively identical to the 2010 IFR, stating that HRSA was to provide \n3  “binding, comprehensive health plan coverage guidelines.”   \n4  C.  The 2011 HRSA Guidelines \n5  From November 2010 to May 2011, a committee convened by the Institute of Medicine \n6  met in response to the charge of HHS’s Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and \n7  Evaluation: to “convene a diverse committee of experts” related to, as relevant here, women’s \n8  health issues.  Inst. of Med., Clinical Preventive Services for Women: Closing the Gaps, 1, 23 \n9  (2011), https://www.nap.edu/read/13181/chapter/1.  In July 2011, the committee issued a report \n10  recommending that private health insurance plans be required to cover all contraceptive methods \n11  approved by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), without cost sharing.  Id. at 102–10.   \n12  On August 1, 2011, HRSA issued its preventive care guidelines (“2011 Guidelines”), \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  defining preventive care coverage to include all FDA-approved contraceptive methods.  See \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Health Res. & Servs. Admin., Women’s Preventive Services Guidelines, \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  https://www.hrsa.gov/womens-guidelines/index.html.3   \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  D.  The 2011 IFR and the Original Religious Exemption \nS d nr\nee 17  On August 3, 2011, the agencies issued an IFR amending the 2010 IFR.  See 76 Fed. Reg. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  46,621 (“the 2011 IFR”).  Based on the “considerable feedback” they received regarding \n19  contraceptive coverage for women, the agencies stated that it was “appropriate that HRSA, in \n20  issuing [its 2011] Guidelines, take[] into account the effect on the religious beliefs of certain \n21  religious employers if coverage of contraceptive services were required.”  Id. at 46,623.  As such, \n22  the agencies provided HRSA with the “additional discretion to exempt certain religious employers \n23  from the [2011] Guidelines where contraceptive services are concerned.”  Id.  They defined a \n24 \n                                                 \n25 \n2 The Department of the Treasury’s regulations were first promulgated in 2012, two years after \nthose of HHS and the Department of Labor. \n26 \n3 On December 20, 2016, HRSA updated the guidelines (“2016 Guidelines”), clarifying that \n“[c]ontraceptive care should include contraceptive counseling, initiation of contraceptive use, and \n27 \nfollow-up care,” as well as “enumerating the full range of contraceptive methods for women” as \nidentified by the FDA.  See Health Res. & Servs. Admin., Women’s Preventive Services \n28 \nGuidelines, https://www.hrsa.gov/womens-guidelines-2016/index.html (last updated Oct. 2017).  \n4 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 5 of 45\n \n1  “religious employer” as one that:  \n(1)  [h]as  the  inculcation  of  religious  values  as  its  purpose;  (2) \n2  primarily  employs  persons  who  share  its  religious  tenets;  (3) \nprimarily serves persons who share its religious tenets; and (4) is a \n3  non-profit  organization  under  [the  relevant  statutory  provisions, \nwhich] refer to churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and conventions \n4  or associations of churches, as well as to the exclusively religious \nactivities of any religious order. \n5 \nId.   \n6 \nThe 2011 IFR went into effect on August 1, 2011.  The agencies again found that they had \n7 \nboth statutory authority and good cause to forgo the APA’s advance notice and comment \n8 \nrequirement.  Id. at 46,624.  Specifically, they found that “providing for an additional opportunity \n9 \nfor public comment [was] unnecessary, as the [2010 IFR] . . . provided the public with an \n10 \nopportunity to comment on the implementation of the preventive services requirement in this \n11 \nprovision, and the amendments made in [the 2011 IFR were] in fact based on such public \n12 \na \ntr in comments.”  Id.  The agencies also found that notice and comment would be “impractical and \nuoro 13 \nC tfila contrary to the public interest,” because that process would result in a delay of implementation of \ncC 14 \ni\nrts fo the 2011 Guidelines.  See id.  The agencies further stated that they were issuing the rule as an IFR \niD tc 15 \n sir in order to provide the public with some opportunity to comment.  Id.  They requested comments \net\ntatsiD 16 \nS d nr by September 30, 2011. \nee 17 \nth\nintr On February 15, 2012, after considering more than 200,000 responses, the agencies issued \nUo\nN 18 \na final rule adopting the definition of “religious employer” set forth in the 2011 IFR.  See 77 Fed. \n19 \nReg. 8,725.  The final rule also established a temporary safe harbor, during which the agencies \n20  plan[ned] to develop and propose changes to these final regulations \nthat  would  meet  two  goals—providing  contraceptive  coverage \n21  without cost-sharing to individuals who want it and accommodating \nnon-exempted,  non-profit  organizations’  religious  objections  to \n22  covering contraceptive services . . . . \n23  Id. at 8,727. \n24  E.  The Religious Accommodation \n25  On March 21, 2012, the agencies issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking \n26  (“ANPR”) requesting comments on “alternative ways of providing contraceptive coverage without \n27  cost sharing in order to accommodate non-exempt, non-profit religious organizations with \n28  religious objections to such coverage.”  77 Fed. Reg. 16,501, 16,503.  They specifically sought to \n5 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 6 of 45\n \n1  “require issuers to offer group health insurance coverage without contraceptive coverage to such \n2  an organization (or its plan sponsor),” while also “provid[ing] contraceptive coverage directly to \n3  the participants and beneficiaries covered under the organization’s plan with no cost sharing.”  Id.  \n4  The agencies requested comment by June 19, 2012. \n5  On February 6, 2013, after reviewing more than 200,000 comments, the agencies issued \n6  proposed rules that (1) simplified the criteria for the religious employer exemption; and (2) \n7  established an accommodation for eligible organizations with religious objections to providing \n8  contraceptive coverage.  See 78 Fed. Reg. 8,456, 8,458–59.  The proposed rule defined an \n9  “eligible organization” as one that (1) “opposes providing coverage for some or all of the \n10  contraceptive services required to be covered”; (2) “is organized and operates as a nonprofit \n11  entity”; (3) “holds itself out as a religious organization”; and (4) self-certifies that it satisfies these \n12  criteria.  Id. at 8,462.  Comments on the proposed rule were due April 5, 2013. \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  On July 2, 2013, after reviewing more than 400,000 comments, the agencies issued final \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  rules simplifying the religious employer exemption and establishing the religious accommodation.  \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  78 Fed. Reg. 39,870.4  With respect to the latter, the final rule retained the definition of “eligible \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  organization” set forth in the proposed rule.  Id. at 39,874.  Under the accommodation, an eligible \nS d nr\nee 17  organization that met a “self-certification standard” was “not required to contract, arrange, pay, or \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  refer for contraceptive coverage,” but its “plan participants and beneficiaries . . . [would] still \n19  benefit from separate payments for contraceptive services without cost sharing or other charge,” as \n20  required by law.  Id.  The final rules were effective August 1, 2013. \n21  F.  The Hobby Lobby and Wheaton College Decisions \n22   On June 30, 2014, the Supreme Court issued its opinion in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby \n23  Stores, Inc., in which three closely-held corporations challenged the requirement that they \n24  “provide health-insurance coverage for methods of contraception that violate[d] the sincerely held \n25 \n                                                 \n26 \n4 As to the definition of a religious employer, the final rule “eliminate[ed] the first three prongs \nand clarif[ied] the fourth prong of the definition” adopted in 2012.  78 Fed. Reg. 39,874.  Under \n27 \nthis new definition, “an employer that [was] organized and operate[d] as a nonprofit entity and \n[was] referred to in section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Code [was] considered a religious \n28 \nemployer for purposes of the religious employer exemption.”  Id. \n6 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 7 of 45\n \n1  religious beliefs of the companies’ owners.”  134 S. Ct. at 2759.  The Court held that this \n2  requirement violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (“RFRA”), 42 U.S.C. § \n3  2000bb et seq., because it was not the “least restrictive means” of serving the government’s \n4  proffered compelling interest in guaranteeing cost-free access to certain methods of contraception.  \n5  See Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2781–82.5  The Court pointed to the religious accommodation as \n6  support for this conclusion: “HHS itself has demonstrated that it has at its disposal an approach \n7  that is less restrictive than requiring employers to fund contraceptive methods that violate their \n8  religious beliefs. . . . HHS has already established an accommodation for nonprofit organizations \n9  with religious objections.”  Id. at 2782.  The Court stated that the Hobby Lobby ruling “[did] not \n10  decide whether an approach of this type complies with RFRA for purposes of all religious claims,” \n11  and said its opinion “should not be understood to hold that an insurance-coverage mandate must \n12  necessarily fall if it conflicts with an employer’s religious beliefs.”  Id. at 2782–83. \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Several days later, the Court issued its opinion in Wheaton College v. Burwell, 134 S. Ct. \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  2806 (2014).  The plaintiff was a nonprofit college in Illinois that was eligible for the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  accommodation.  Id. at 2808 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting).  Wheaton College sought an injunction, \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  however, “on the theory that its filing of a self-certification form [would] make it complicit in the \nS d nr\nee 17  provision of contraceptives by triggering the obligation for someone else to provide the services to \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  which it objects.”  Id.  The Court granted the application for an injunction, ordering that it was \n19  sufficient for the college to “inform[] the Secretary of Health and Human Services in writing that \n20  it is a nonprofit organization that holds itself out as religious and has religious objections to \n21  providing coverage for contraceptive services.”  Id. at 2807.  In other words, the college was not \n22  required to “use the form prescribed by the [g]overnment,” nor did it need to “send copies to \n23  health insurance issuers or third-party administrators.”  Id.  The Court stated that its order “should \n24  not be construed as an expression of the Court’s views on the merits.”  Id. \n25  G.  Post-Hobby Lobby and -Wheaton Regulatory Actions \n26  Shortly thereafter, on August 27, 2014, the agencies initiated two regulatory actions.  First, \n27 \n                                                 \n5 The Court assumed without deciding that such an interest was compelling within the meaning of \n28 \nRFRA.  Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2780. \n7 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 8 of 45\n \n1  in light of Hobby Lobby, they issued proposed rules “amend[ing] the definition of an eligible \n2  organization [for purposes of the religious accommodation] to include a closely held for-profit \n3  entity that has a religious objection to providing coverage for some or all of the contraceptive \n4  services otherwise required to be covered.”  79 Fed. Reg. 51,118, 51,121.  Comments were due on \n5  October 21, 2014. \n6  Second, in light of Wheaton, the agencies issued IFRs (“the 2014 IFRs”) providing “an \n7  alternative process for the sponsor of a group health plan or an institution of higher education to \n8  provide notice of its religious objection to coverage of all or a subset of contraceptive services, as \n9  an alternative to the EBSA Form 700 [i.e., the standard] method of self-certification.”  79 Fed. \n10  Reg. 51,092, 51,095.  The agencies asserted they had both statutory authority and good cause to \n11  forgo the notice and comment period, stating that such a process would be “impracticable and \n12  contrary to the public interest,” particularly in light of Wheaton.  Id. at 51,095–96.  The IFRs were \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  effective immediately, and comments were due October 27, 2014.   \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  After considering more than 75,000 comments on the proposed rule, the agencies issued \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  final rules “extend[ing] the accommodation to a for-profit entity that is not publicly traded, is \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  majority-owned by a relatively small number of individuals, and objects to providing \nS d nr\nee 17  contraceptive coverage based on its owners’ religious beliefs”—i.e., to closely-held entities.  80 \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Fed. Reg. 41,318, 41,324.  The agencies also issued a final rule “continu[ing] to allow eligible \n19  organizations to choose between using EBSA Form 700 or the alternative process consistent with \n20  the Wheaton interim order.”  Id. at 41,323. \n21  H.  The Zubik Opinion and Subsequent Impasse \n22  On May 16, 2016, the Supreme Court issued its opinion in Zubik v. Burwell, 136 S. Ct. \n23  1557 (2016) (per curiam).  The petitioners, primarily non-profit organizations, were eligible for \n24  the religious accommodation, but challenged the requirement that they submit notice to either their \n25  insurer or the federal government as a violation of RFRA.  Zubik, 136 S. Ct. at 1558.  “Following \n26  oral argument, the Court requested supplemental briefing from the parties addressing ‘whether \n27  contraceptive coverage could be provided to petitioners’ employees, through petitioners’ insurance \n28  companies, without any such notice from petitioners.’”  Id. at 1558–59.  After the parties stated \n8 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 9 of 45\n \n1  that “such an option [was] feasible,” the Court remanded to afford them “an opportunity to arrive \n2  at an approach going forward that accommodates petitioners’ religious exercise while at the same \n3  time ensuring that women covered by petitioners’ health plans ‘receive full and equal health \n4  coverage, including contraceptive coverage.’”  Id. at 1559 (emphasis added).  As in Wheaton, \n5  “[t]he Court express[ed] no view on the merits of the cases,” and did not decide “whether \n6  petitioners’ religious exercise has been substantially burdened, whether the [g]overnment has a \n7  compelling interest, or whether the current regulations are the least restrictive means of serving \n8  that interest.”  Id. at 1560.  \n9  On July 22, 2016, the agencies issued a request for information (“RFI”) on whether, in \n10  light of Zubik,  \nthere  are  alternative  ways  (other  than  those  offered  in  current \n11  regulations)  for  eligible  organizations  that  object  to  providing \ncoverage for contraceptive services on religious grounds to obtain an \na  12  accommodation,  while  still  ensuring  that  women  enrolled  in  the \ntr in organizations’ health plans have access to seamless coverage of the \nuoro 13  full range of [FDA]-approved contraceptives without cost sharing. \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  81 Fed. Reg. 47,741, 47,741 (July 22, 2016).  Comments were due September 20, 2016.  On \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  January 9, 2017, the agencies issued a document titled “FAQs About Affordable Care Act \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Implementation Part 36” (“FAQs”).   See Dep’t of Labor, FAQs About Affordable Care Act \nS d nr\nee 17  Implementation Part 36 (Jan. 9, 2017), https://www.dol.gov/sites/default/files/ebsa/about-\nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/faqs/aca-part-36.pdf.   \n19      The FAQs stated that, based on the 54,000 comments received in response to the July 2016 \n20  RFI, there was “no feasible approach . . . at this time that would resolve the concerns of religious \n21  objectors, while still ensuring that the affected women receive full and equal health coverage, \n22  including contraceptive coverage.”  Id. at 4. \n23  I.  The 2017 IFRs  \n24  On May 4, 2017, the President issued Executive Order No. 13,798, directing the secretaries \n25  of the Departments of the Treasury, Labor, and HHS to “consider issuing amended regulations, \n26  consistent with applicable law, to address conscience-based objections to the preventive care \n27  mandate.”  82 Fed. Reg. 21,675, 21,675.   Subsequently, on October 6, 2017, the agencies issued \n28  the Religious Exemption IFR and the Moral Exemption IFR (collectively, “the 2017 IFRs”), \n9 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 10 of 45\n \n1  which were effective immediately.  The 2017 IFRs departed from the previous regulations in \n2  several important ways. \n3  1.  The Religious Exemption IFR \n4  First, with the Religious Exemption IFR, the agencies substantially broadened the scope of \n5  the religious exemption, extending it “to encompass entities, and individuals, with sincerely held \n6  religious beliefs objecting to contraceptive or sterilization coverage,” and “making the \n7  accommodation process optional for eligible organizations.”  82 Fed. Reg. 47,792, 47,807–08.  \n8  Such entities “will not be required to comply with a self-certification process.”  Id. at 47,808.  Just \n9  as the IFR expanded eligibility for the exemption, it “likewise” expanded eligibility for the \n10  optional accommodation.  Id. at 47,812–13. \n11  In introducing these changes, the agencies stated they “recently exercised [their] discretion \n12  to reevaluate these exemptions and accommodations,” and considered factors including: “the \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  interests served by the existing Guidelines, regulations, and accommodation process”; the \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  “extensive litigation”; the President’s executive order; the interest in protecting the free exercise of \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  religion under the First Amendment and RFRA; the discretion afforded under the relevant \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  statutory provisions; and “the regulatory process and comments submitted in various requests for \nS d nr\nee 17  public comments.”  Id. at 47,793.  The agencies advanced several arguments they claimed justified \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  the lack of an advance notice and comment process for the Religious Exemption IFR, which \n19  became effective immediately. \n20  First, the agencies cited 26 U.S.C. § 9833, 29 U.S.C. § 1191c, and 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-92, \n21  asserting that those statutes authorized the agencies “to promulgate any interim final rules that \n22  they determine are appropriate to carry out” the relevant statutory provisions.  Id. at 47,813.  \n23  Second, the agencies asserted that even if the APA did apply, they had good cause to forgo notice \n24  and comment because implementing that process “would be impracticable and contrary to the \n25  public interest.”  Id.  Third, the agencies noted that “[i]n response to several of the previous rules \n26  on this issue—including three issued as [IFRs] under the statutory authority cited above—the \n27  Departments received more than 100,000 public comments on multiple occasions,” which \n28  included “extensive discussion about whether and by what extent to expand the exemption.”  Id. at \n10 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 11 of 45\n \n1  47,814.  For all of these reasons, the agencies asserted, “it would be impracticable and contrary to \n2  the public interest to engage in full notice and comment rulemaking before putting these interim \n3  final rules into effect.”  Id. at 47,815.  Comments were due on December 5, 2017.   \n4  2.  The Moral Exemption IFR \n5  Also on October 6, 2017, the agencies issued the Moral Exemption IFR, “expand[ing] the \n6  exemption[] to include additional entities and persons that object based on sincerely held moral \n7  convictions.”  82 Fed. Reg. 47,838, 47,849.  Additionally, “consistent with [their] expansion of the \n8  exemption, [the agencies] expand[ed] eligibility for the accommodation to include organizations \n9  with sincerely held moral convictions concerning contraceptive coverage,” while also making the \n10  accommodation process optional for those entities.  Id.  The agencies included in the IFR a section \n11  called “Congress’ History of Providing Exemptions for Moral Convictions,” referencing statutes \n12  and legislative history, case law, executive orders, and state analogues.  See id. at 47,844–48.  The \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  agencies justified the immediate issuance of the Moral Exemption IFR without an advance notice \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  and comment process on grounds similar to those offered regarding the Religious Exemption IFR, \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  stating that “[o]therwise, our regulations would simultaneously provide and deny relief to entities \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  and individuals that are, in the [agencies’] view, similarly deserving of exemptions and \nS d nr\nee 17  accommodations consistent[] with similar protections in other federal laws.”  Id. at 47,855.  \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Comments were due on December 5, 2017. \n19  3.  Preliminary Injunction Against the 2017 IFRs \n20  On October 6, 2017, the States of California, Delaware, Maryland, and New York, and the \n21  Commonwealth of Virginia filed a complaint, see Dkt. No. 1, which was followed by a First \n22  Amended Complaint on November 1, see Dkt. No. 24 (“FAC”).  Plaintiffs alleged that the 2017 \n23  IFRs violated Sections 553 and 706 of the Administrative Procedure Act, the Establishment \n24  Clause, and the Equal Protection Clause.  FAC ¶¶ 8–12, 116–37.  Plaintiffs filed a motion for a \n25  preliminary injunction on November 9, 2017.  See Dkt. No. 28. \n26  a.  The Court’s Nationwide Injunction \n27  On December 21, 2017, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.  \n28  See Dkt. No. 105.  The Court held that Plaintiffs had “shown that, at a minimum, they are likely to \n11 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 12 of 45\n \n1  succeed on their claim that Defendants violated the APA by issuing the 2017 IFRs without \n2  advance notice and comment.”  Id. at 17.  In addition, the Court held that Plaintiffs were likely to \n3  suffer irreparable harm, that the balance of equities tipped in Plaintiffs’ favor, and that the public \n4  interest favored granting an injunction.  Id.  Accordingly, the Court issued a nationwide \n5  preliminary injunction enjoining implementation of the 2017 IFRs.  See id. at 28.  The Court’s \n6  order reinstated the “state of affairs” that existed prior to October 6, 2017, including the exemption  \n7  and accommodation as they existed following the Zubik remand as well as any court orders \n8  enjoining the Federal Defendants from enforcing the rules against specific parties.  See id. at 29.6 \n9  b.  Intervenors Little Sisters and March for Life Enter the Case  \n10  On December 29, 2017, the Court granted the Little Sisters’ motion to intervene.  See Dkt. \n11  No. 115.  And on January 26, 2018, the Court granted March for Life’s motion to intervene.  See \n12  Dkt. No. 134. \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  c.  Ninth Circuit Appeal and Decision Limiting Scope of Injunction \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Following the Court’s order granting Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  agencies, Little Sisters, and March for Life appealed.  See Dkt. Nos. 135–38, 142–43. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  On December 13, 2018, the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion largely affirming this Court’s \nS d nr\nee 17  prior order, but shrinking the geographic scope of the injunction to encompass only the states that \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  were plaintiffs at that time.  See California, 911 F.3d at 584.  First, the court held (on an issue of \n19  first impression) that venue was proper in the Northern District of California because “common \n20  sense” dictated that “a state with multiple judicial districts ‘resides’ in every district within its \n21  borders.”  Id. at 570.  Second, the court held that the States had standing to bring their procedural \n22  APA claim because the States had shown “with reasonable probability[] that the IFRs will first \n23  lead to women losing employer-sponsored contraceptive coverage, which will then result in \n24  economic harm to the states.”  Id. at 571–72.  The court noted that the States had no obligation to \n25  identify a specific woman who would lose coverage, particularly given that the agencies’ \n26 \n                                                 \n27 \n6 A federal district court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania also entered a preliminary \ninjunction against the IFRs to “maintain the status quo” pending the outcome of a trial on the \n28 \nmerits.  See Pennsylvania v. Trump, 281 F. Supp. 3d 553, 585 (E.D. Pa. 2017). \n12 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 13 of 45\n \n1  regulatory impact analysis estimated that between 31,700 and 120,000 women would lose \n2  contraceptive coverage, and that “state and local governments will bear additional economic \n3  costs.”  Id. at 571–72.  Third, the court held that the Plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits \n4  of their APA claim because the agencies had neither good cause nor statutory authority for \n5  bypassing the usual notice and comment procedure, and that the procedural violation was likely \n6  not harmless.  Id. at 578–81.  Fourth, the court affirmed this Court’s ruling that the Plaintiffs had \n7  established the other requirements to entitle them to injunctive relief because they were likely to \n8  suffer irreparable harm absent an injunction, and the balance of the equities and public interest \n9  tilted in favor of granting an injunction.  Id. at 581–82.  Fifth, the court concluded that the scope of \n10  the preliminary injunction was overbroad because an injunction applying only to the Plaintiff-\n11  States would “provide complete relief to them.”  Id. at 584. \na  12  J.  The 2019 Final Rules \ntr in\nuoro 13  The 2017 IFRs included a call for comments, due by December 5, 2017.  See 82 Fed. Reg. \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  at 47,792; 82 Fed. Reg. at 47,838.  Over the 60-day comment period, the agencies received over \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  56,000 public comments on the religious exemption rules, 83 Fed. Reg. at 57,540, and over 54,000 \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  public comments on the moral exemption rules, 83 Fed. Reg. at 57,596.   \nS d nr\nee 17  On November 15, 2018, the agencies promulgated the Religious Exemption and Moral \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Exemption Final Rules.  See 83 Fed. Reg. 57,536; 83 Fed. Reg. 57,592.  The 2019 Final Rules are \n19  scheduled to take effect, superseding the enjoined IFRs, on January 14, 2019.   \n20  In substance, the Final Rules are nearly identical to the 2017 IFRs.  See Defendants’ \n21  Opposition, Dkt. No. 198 (“Federal Opp.”) at 8 (noting that the “fundamental substance of the \n22  exemptions was finalized as set forth in the IFRs”); see also Supplemental Brief for the Federal \n23  Appellants at 1, California v. Azar, 911 F.3d 558 (9th Cir. 2018) (Nos. 18-15144, 18-15166, 18-\n24  15255), 2018 WL 6044850, at *1 (“The substance of the rules remains largely unchanged . . . and \n25  none of the changes is material to the States’ substantive claims in this case.”).  The Religious \n26  Exemption made “various changes . . . to clarify the intended scope of the language” in “response \n27  to public comments.”  83 Fed. Reg. at 57,537.  Likewise, the Moral Exemption Final Rule made \n28  “various changes . . . to clarify the intended scope of the language” in “response to public \n13 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 14 of 45\n \n1  comments.”  83 Fed. Reg. at 57,593.  \n2  At least three changes in the Final Rules bear mentioning.   First, the Final Rules estimate \n3  that “no more than 126,400 women of childbearing age will be affected by the expanded \n4  exemptions,” which is an increase from the previous estimate of  up to 120,000 women.  Compare \n5  83 Fed. Reg. at 57,551 n.26 with 82 Fed. Reg. at 47,823.  Second, the Final Rules increase their \n6  estimate of the expense of the exemptions to $67.3 million nationwide annually.  See 83 Fed. Reg. \n7  at 57,581.  Third, the Final Rules place increased emphasis on the availability of contraceptives at \n8  Title X family-planning clinics as an alternative to contraceptives provided by women’s health \n9  insurers.  See 83 Fed. Reg. at 57,551; 83 Fed. Reg. at 57,608; see also 83 Fed. Reg. at 25,502, \n10  25,514 (proposed rule rendering women who lose contraceptive coverage because of religious or \n11  moral exemptions eligible for Title X services). \na  12  K.  Plaintiffs Challenge the Final Rules \ntr in\nuoro 13  On December 18, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint, alleging that the \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  IFRs and Final Rules violate Section 553 of the APA, and that the Final Rules violate Section 706 \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  of the APA, the Establishment Clause, and the Equal Protection Clause.  See Dkt. No. 170 \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  (“SAC”) ¶¶ 235–60.  Original Plaintiffs—the States of California, Delaware, Maryland, and New \nS d nr\nee 17  York, and the Commonwealth of Virginia—were joined by the States of Connecticut, Hawaii, \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Illinois, Minnesota, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington, and the District of \n19  Columbia.  Id. at 13–26.   \n20  On December 19, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, seeking to enjoin \n21  the implementation of the Final Rules.  See Dkt. No. 174 (“Mot.”) at 25.  The Federal Defendants \n22  filed an opposition on January 3, 2019.  See Federal Opp.  That same day, both the Little Sisters, \n23  see Dkt. No. 197 (“Little Sisters Opp.”), and March for Life, see Dkt. No. 199 (“March for Life \n24  Opp.”), filed oppositions.7  The States replied on January 8.  See Dkt. No. 218 (“Reply”).8   \n25 \n                                                 \n7 The Little Sisters filed a corrected opposition brief on January 10.  See Dkt. No. 174. \n26 \n8 Numerous amici curiae also filed briefs to present their views on the case.  See Dkt. Nos. 212 \n(American Nurses Association; American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists; American \n27 \nAcademy of Nursing; American Academy of Pediatricians; Physicians for Reproductive Health; \nCalifornia Medical Association); 230 (California Women Lawyers; Girls Inc., If/When/How: \n28 \nLawyering for Reproductive Justice; Lawyers Club of San Diego; American Association of \n14 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 15 of 45\n \n1  The Court held a hearing on January 11, after which it took the motion under submission.   \n2  II.  LEGAL STANDARD \n3  A preliminary injunction is a matter of equitable discretion and is “an extraordinary \n4  remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.” \n5  Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008).  “A plaintiff seeking preliminary \n6  injunctive relief must establish that [it] is likely to succeed on the merits, that [it] is likely to suffer \n7  irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in [its] favor, \n8  and that an injunction is in the public interest.”  Id. at 20.  Alternatively, an injunction may issue \n9  where “the likelihood of success is such that serious questions going to the merits were raised and \n10  the balance of hardships tips sharply in [the plaintiff’s] favor,” provided that the plaintiff can also \n11  demonstrate the other two Winter factors.  Alliance for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d \n12  1127, 1131–32 (9th Cir. 2011) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  Under either \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  standard, Plaintiffs bear the burden of making a clear showing that they are entitled to this \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  extraordinary remedy.  Earth Island Inst. v. Carlton, 626 F.3d 462, 469 (9th Cir. 2010).  The most \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  important Winter factor is likelihood of success on the merits.  See Disney Enters., Inc. v. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  VidAngel, Inc., 869 F.3d 848, 856 (9th Cir. 2017).   \nS d nr\nee 17  III.  ANALYSIS \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  A.  Venue Is Proper in the Northern District of California. \n19  Despite a clear holding from the Ninth Circuit, Federal Defendants continue to press their \n20  argument that venue is not proper in the Northern District because the State of California resides \n21  for venue purposes only in the Eastern District, “where Sacramento, the seat of state government, \n22 \n                                                 \n23 \nUniversity Women; American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees; American \nFederation of Teachers; Colorado Women’s Bar Association; National Association of Social \n24 \nWorkers; National Association of Women Lawyers; Service Employees International Union; \nWomen’s Bar Association of Massachusetts; Women’s Bar Association of the District of \n25 \nColumbia; Women Lawyers on Guard, Inc.; Women’s Bar Association of the State of New York); \n231 (National Association for Female Executives; U.S. Women’s Chamber of Commerce); 232 \n26 \n(National Asian Pacific American Women’s Forum; National Latina Institute for Reproductive \nHealth; National Women’s Law Center; SisterLove, Inc.); 233 (Commonwealth of Massachusetts; \n27 \nStates of Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Oregon).  \nThe Court has reviewed their filings and considered them in assessing this motion.  \n28 \n \n15 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 16 of 45\n \n1  is located.”  Federal Opp. at 10.  But the Ninth Circuit held that 28 U.S.C. 1391 “dictates that a \n2  state with multiple judicial districts ‘resides’ in every district within its borders.”  California, 911 \n3  F.3d at 570.  An “interpretation limiting residency to a single district in the state would defy \n4  common sense.”  Id.  Given the clear precedent from the Ninth Circuit on this issue, the Court \n5  need not dwell on it: venue is proper in the Northern District.  \n6  B.  Plaintiffs Have Standing to Sue. \n7  The Little Sisters contend that the States lack standing to sue, see Little Sisters Opp. at 9, \n8  and the agencies “reserve the right to object” to relief for any plaintiff that has not established \n9  standing, see Federal Opp. at 10 n.4.  The Court finds that Plaintiffs have established both Article \n10  III and statutory standing. \n11  1.  Plaintiffs Have Article III Standing. \n12  A plaintiff seeking relief in federal court bears the burden of establishing “the irreducible \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  constitutional minimum” of standing.  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016) \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992)).  First, the plaintiff must have \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  “suffered an injury in fact.”  Spokeo, 136 S. Ct. at 1547.  This requires “an invasion of a legally \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  protected interest” that is concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent, rather than conjectural \nS d nr\nee 17  or hypothetical.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Second, the plaintiff’s \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  injury must be “fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant.”  Spokeo, 136 S. Ct. at \n19  1547.  Third, the injury must be “likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.”  Id. \n20  (citing Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560–61). \n21  “States are not normal litigants for the purposes of invoking federal jurisdiction,” \n22  Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 518 (2007), and are “entitled to special solicitude in [the] \n23  standing analysis,” id. at 520.  For instance, states may sue to assert their “quasi-sovereign interest \n24  in the health and well-being—both physical and economic—of [their] residents in general.”  \n25  Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico, 458 U.S. 592, 607 (1982).  In that case, however, the \n26  “interest must be sufficiently concrete to create an actual controversy between the State and the \n27  defendant” such that the state is more than a nominal party.  Id. at 602.   \n28  Here, the Court need not rely on the special solicitude afforded to states, or their power to \n16 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 17 of 45\n \n1  litigate their quasi-sovereign interests on behalf of their citizens.  Much more simply, a state may \n2  establish standing by showing a reasonably probable threat to its economic interests.  See \n3  California, 911 F.3d at 573; see also Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 155 (5th Cir. 2015) \n4  (State of Texas had standing to mount APA challenge to Deferred Action for Parents of \n5  Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents program because Texas would “incur significant \n6  costs in issuing driver’s licenses to [program] beneficiaries”), aff’d by equally divided Court, 136 \n7  S. Ct. 2271, 2272 (2016).  Plaintiffs have demonstrated at least two ways in which implementation \n8  of the Final Rules will damage their States’ fiscs: through increased reliance on state-funded \n9  family-planning programs and through the state-borne costs of unintended pregnancies. \n10  First, Plaintiffs have shown that the Final Rules will “lead to women losing employer-\n11  sponsored contraceptive coverage, which will then result in economic harm to the states” as these \n12  women “turn to state-based programs or programs reimbursed by the state.”  California, 911 F.3d \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  at 571–72.  The Little Sisters take issue with the Ninth Circuit’s reasoning because “the States \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  have still failed to identify anyone who will actually be harmed by the Mandate.”  Little Sisters \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Opp. at 9.  But the Ninth Circuit was clear that the States need not identify a specific woman likely \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  to lose contraceptive coverage to establish standing.  California, 911 F.3d at 572.  Even if the \nS d nr\nee 17  States have not identified specific women who will be impacted by the Final Rules, Federal \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Defendants themselves have done much of the work to establish that Plaintiffs have standing.  The \n19  Religious Exemption states that up to approximately 126,400 “women of childbearing age will be \n20  affected by the expanded exemptions.”  83 Fed. Reg. at 57,551 n.26.  At an estimated expense of \n21  $584 per year per woman impacted, this amounts to $67.3 million nationwide annually.  See id. at \n22  57,581.9  Further, the Final Rules explicitly rely on Title X clinics as a backstop for women who \n23  lose contraceptive coverage as a result of the Final Rules.  See id. at 57,551; 83 Fed. Reg. at \n24  57,608; see also 83 Fed. Reg. at 25,502.  But Plaintiffs have shown that in many of their States, \n25  these already cash-strapped Title X clinics are operated in conjunction with state family planning \n26 \n                                                 \n27 \n9 The Moral Exemption estimates that approximately 15 women of childbearing age will lose their \naccess to cost-free contraceptives.  See 83 Fed. Reg. at 57,627.  At an average cost of $584 \n28 \nannually, this amounts to $8,760 each year.  See id. at 57,628. \n17 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 18 of 45\n \n1  services, meaning that any increase in enrollment will likely increase costs to the state.  See \n2  Declaration of Kathryn Kost (“Kost Decl.”), Dkt. No. 174-19 ¶ 48 (“Title X is able to serve only \n3  one-fifth of the nationwide need for publicly funded contraceptive care” and “cannot sustain \n4  additional beneficiaries as a result of the Final Rules”); Declaration of Mari Cantwell (“Cantwell \n5  Decl.”), Dkt. No. 174-4 ¶ 18 (all California Title X clinics are also California Family Planning, \n6  Access, Care, and Treatment program providers); Declaration of Lauren J. Tobias (“Tobias \n7  Decl.”), Dkt. No. 174-33 ¶ 5 (New York Title X clinics are same as state family planning program \n8  clinics).  Or the States will be forced to shoulder the costs of the Final Rules more directly, as \n9  Federal Defendants refer women to Title X clinics funded directly by the state.  See Declaration of \n10  Karen Nelson (“Nelson Decl.”), Dkt. No. 174-25 ¶ 20 ($6 million of Maryland’s Title X budget \n11  comes from state, $3 million from federal government). \n12  In addition, the States have submitted voluminous and detailed evidence documenting how \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  their female residents are predicted to lose access to contraceptive coverage because of the Final \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Rules—and how those women likely will turn to state programs to obtain no-cost contraceptives, \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  at significant cost to the States.  See, e.g., Cantwell Decl., Dkt. No. 174-4 ¶¶ 16–18 (Final Rules \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  will result in more women becoming eligible for California’s Family Planning, Access, Care, and \nS d nr\nee 17  Treatment program, meaning that “state dollars may be diverted to provide” contraceptive \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  coverage); Nelson Decl., Dkt. No. 174-25 ¶ 20 (“it will be difficult for the current [State of \n19  Maryland] budget levels to accommodate the increase in women seeking [Title X services] after \n20  losing contraception coverage in their insurance plans”); Tobias Decl., Dkt. No. 174-33 ¶ 5 \n21  (exemptions in Final Rules “will result in more women receiving” New York Family Planning \n22  Program services, thus putting program at “risk [of] being overwhelmed by the increase in \n23  patients”); Declaration of Jonathan Werberg, Dkt. No. 174-36 ¶¶ 5–8 (identifying New York \n24  employers that are likely to invoke exemptions “because of their involvement in previous \n25  litigation”: Hobby Lobby, with 720 New York employees; Nyack College, with 3,000 students \n26  and 1,100 employees in New York; and Charles Feinberg Center for Messianic Jewish Studies, \n27  whose parent university has 1,000 students nationwide).  Of course, under the status quo, these \n28  women have a statutory entitlement to free contraceptives through their regular health insurance \n18 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 19 of 45\n \n1  and thus impose no cost on the States.  The States have established a causal chain linking them to \n2  harm if the Final Rules were implemented.  See California, 911 F.3d at 571–72. \n3  Second, the States have shown that the Final Rules are likely to result in a decrease in the \n4  use of effective contraception, thus leading to unintended pregnancies which would impose \n5  significant costs on the States.  Some of the most effective contraceptive methods are also among \n6  the most expensive.  See Kost Decl. ¶¶ 15–18, 24.  For example, long-acting reversible \n7  contraceptives are among the most effective methods, but may cost a woman over $1,000.  See id. \n8  ¶ 25.  Women who lose their entitlement to cost-free contraceptives are less likely to use an \n9  effective method, or any method at all—resulting in unintended pregnancies.  See id. ¶ 27, 36–42; \n10  Declaration of Lisa M. Hollier (“Hollier Decl.”), Dkt. No. 174-15 ¶ 6; Declaration of Walker A. \n11  Wilson (“Wilson Decl.”), Dkt. No. 174-38 ¶ 5 (Final Rules may cause women in North Carolina \n12  to “forgo coverage and experience an unintended pregnancy”); Nelson Decl., Dkt. No. 174-25 ¶ \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  30 (unintended pregnancy rate of women not using contraception is 45% and loss of coverage will \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  result in more unintended pregnancies); Declaration of Karyl T. Rattay (“Rattay Decl.”), Dkt. No. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  174-30 (Final Rules “will contribute to an increase in Delaware’s nationally high unintended \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  pregnancy rate as women forego needed contraception and other services”).  Much of the financial \nS d nr\nee 17  burden of these unintended pregnancies will be borne by the States.  See, e.g., Rattay Decl., Dkt. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  No. 174-30 (in 2010, 71.3% of unplanned births in Delaware were publicly funded, costing \n19  Delaware $36 million); Declaration of Nicole Alexander-Scott (“Alexander-Scott Decl.”), Dkt. \n20  No. 174-7 ¶ 3 (unintended pregnancies likely to result from Final Rules will impose costs on state \n21  of Rhode Island); Wilson Decl., Dkt. No. 174-38 ¶ 5 (unintended pregnancies likely to result from \n22  Final Rules will impose costs on State of North Carolina); Declaration of Nathan Moracco \n23  (“Moracco Decl.”), Dkt. No. 174-23 ¶ 5 (State of Minnesota “may bear a financial risk when \n24  women lose contraceptive coverage” because State is obligated to pay for child delivery and \n25  newborn care for children born to low-income mothers).10 \n26 \n                                                 \n10 Of course, these financial costs to the States do not capture the additional substantial costs—\n27 \nwhether they be financial, professional, or personal—to women who unintendedly become \npregnant after losing access to the cost-free contraceptives to which they are entitled.  See, e.g., \n28 \nPlanned Parenthood of Se. Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 856 (1992) (“The ability of women to \n19 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 20 of 45\n \n1  In sum, Plaintiffs have shown that the challenged Final Rules pose a reasonably probable \n2  threat to their economic interests because they will be forced to pay for contraceptives that are no \n3  longer provided cost-free to women as guaranteed by the Affordable Care Act, as the Ninth Circuit \n4  found with respect to the five original Plaintiff States.  See California, 911 F.3d at 570.  The States \n5  also have established a reasonable probability that they will suffer economic harm from the \n6  consequences of unintended pregnancies resulting from the reduced availability of contraceptives.  \n7  These injuries are directly traceable to the exemptions created by the Final Rules.  As the Ninth \n8  Circuit noted, under the APA, the States “will not be able to recover monetary damages.”  Id. at \n9  581 (citing 5 U.S.C. § 702 (permitting “relief other than money damages”)); see also Haines v. \n10  Fed. Motor Carrier Safety Admin., 814 F.3d 417, 426 (6th Cir. 2016) (federal courts do not have \n11  jurisdiction to adjudicate suits seeking monetary damages under the APA).  Thus, granting a \n12  preliminary injunction is the only effective way to redress the potential harm to the States until the \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Court can fully assess the merits.  The States have established the requirements of Article III \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  standing.   \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  2.  Plaintiffs Have Statutory Standing. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  In addition to establishing Article III standing, a plaintiff must show that it “has a cause of \nS d nr\nee 17  action under the statute.”  Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  128 (2014).  The APA provides that a “person . . . adversely affected or aggrieved by agency \n19  action within the meaning of a relevant statute, is entitled to judicial review thereof.”  5 U.S.C. § \n20  702.  Courts have interpreted this provision to mean that a plaintiff must “establish (1) that there \n21  has been final agency action adversely affecting the plaintiff, and (2) that, as a result, it suffers \n22  legal wrong or that its injury falls within the zone of interests of the statutory provision the \n23  plaintiff claims was violated.”  Citizens for Better Forestry v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 341 F.3d 961, \n24 \n                                                 \n25 \nparticipate equally in the economic and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability \nto control their reproductive lives.”); Brief of Amici Curiae U.S. Women’s Chamber of Commerce \n26 \nand National Association for Female Executives, Dkt. No. 231 at 12 (58% of women paid out-of-\npocket costs for intrauterine devices prior to Women’s Health Amendment, but only 13% by \n27 \nMarch 2014); Brief of Amici Curiae American Association of University Women, et al., Dkt. No. \n230 at 16–17 (explaining the “tremendous and adverse personal, professional, social, and \n28 \neconomic effects” of reducing women’s access to contraceptives). \n20 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 21 of 45\n \n1  976 (9th Cir. 2003) (internal quotation omitted). \n2  First, a final rule is, as the name suggests, a final agency action.  See id.  Second, \n3  Plaintiffs’ alleged injury—increased costs from providing contraceptives and from the \n4  consequences of unintended pregnancies—is within the zone of interests of the Women’s Health \n5  Amendment, which was enacted to ensure that women would have access to cost-free \n6  contraceptives through their health insurance.  Cf. City of Sausalito v. O’Neill, 386 F.3d 1186, \n7  1204–05 (9th Cir. 2004) (plaintiff city within zone of interests of Concessions Management \n8  Improvement Act because  it “assert[ed] injury to its ‘proprietary interest’”); Citizens for Better \n9  Forestry, 341 F.3d at 976 (plaintiffs had statutory standing because “trying to protect the \n10  environment” was within zone of interests of National Environmental Policy Act).  Thus, \n11  Plaintiffs have established statutory standing. \na  12  C.  Plaintiffs Have Shown They Are Entitled to a Preliminary Injunction. \ntr in\nuoro 13  Plaintiffs are entitled to a preliminary injunction as to the Final Rules.  As to both rules, \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Plaintiffs have shown that they are likely to succeed, or at a minimum have raised serious \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  questions going to the merits, on their claim that the Religious Exemption and the Moral \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Exemption are inconsistent with the Women’s Health Amendment, and thus violate the APA.  \nS d nr\nee 17  Plaintiffs also have shown that they are likely to suffer irreparable harm as a result of this \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  violation, that the balance of hardships tips sharply in their favor, and that the public interest \n19  favors granting the injunction. \n20  1.   Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in, or have at a minimum raised serious \nquestions regarding, their argument that the Religious Exemption is \n21  “not in accordance with” the ACA, and thus violates the APA. \n22  Under the APA, “agency decisions may be set aside only if ‘arbitrary, capricious, an abuse \n23  of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.’”  Snoqualmie Indian Tribe v. FERC, 545 \n24  F.3d 1207, 1212 (9th Cir. 2008) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  Plaintiffs argue that “[t]he Rules \n25  cannot be reconciled with the text and purpose of the ACA—which seeks to promote access to \n26  women’s healthcare, not limit it.”  Mot. at 10.  The Court agrees that Plaintiffs are likely correct, \n27  or have, at a minimum, raised serious questions going to the merits of this claim.  To explain why, \n28  the Court must address three contentions made by the Federal Defendants and the Intervenors:  (1) \n21 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 22 of 45\n \n1  the Contraceptive Mandate is not actually a “mandate” at all, but rather a policy determination \n2  wholly subject to the agencies’ discretion; (2) the changes codified in the Religious Exemption \n3  were mandated by RFRA; and (3) even if the agencies were not required under RFRA to adopt the \n4  Religious Exemption, they nonetheless had discretion to do so. \n5  a.  The “Contraceptive Mandate” in the Women’s Health \nAmendment is in fact a statutory mandate. \n6 \nEchoing the Final Rules, the Federal Defendants initially argue that “the ACA grants \n7 \nHRSA, and in turn the Agencies, significant discretion to shape the content and scope of any \n8 \npreventive-services guidelines adopted pursuant to § 300gg-13(a)(4).”  Federal Opp. at 17; see \n9 \nalso Little Sisters Opp. at 12 (“The ACA did not mandate contraceptive coverage.  Instead, \n10 \nCongress delegated to HRSA discretion to determine the contours of the preventive services \n11 \nguidelines.”).  Federal Defendants thus contend that this section of the statute “must be understood \n12 \na \ntr in as a positive grant of authority for HRSA to develop the women’s preventive-service guidelines \nuoro 13 \nC tfila and for the Agencies, as the administering Agencies of the applicable statutes, to shape that \ncC 14 \ni\nrts fo development.”  Federal Opp. at 18.  Federal Defendants’ conclusion is that Section 300gg-13(a)(4) \niD tc 15 \n sir “thus authorized HRSA to adopt guidelines for coverage that include an exemption for certain \net\ntatsiD 16 \nS d nr employers, and nothing in the ACA prevents HHS from supervising HRSA in the development of \nee 17 \nth\nintr those guidelines.”  Id.      \nUo\nN 18 \nThe Court rejects the Federal Defendants’ claim that the ACA delegated total authority to \n19 \nthe agencies to exempt anyone they wish from the contraceptive mandate.  The Federal \n20 \nDefendants never appear to have denied that the statutory mandate is a mandate until the issuance \n21 \nof the IFRs (and the ensuing litigation in this district and in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania \n22 \nchallenging the IFRs and now the Final Rules).  They cite no case in which a court has accepted \n23 \nthis claim.  To the contrary, this Court knows of no Supreme Court, court of appeal or district \n24 \ncourt decision that did not presume that the ACA requires specified categories of health insurance \n25 \nplans and issuers to provide contraceptive coverage at no cost to women.  See, e.g., Zubik, 136 S. \n26 \nCt. at 1559 (“Federal regulations require petitioners to cover certain contraceptives as part of their \n27 \nhealth plans”); Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2762; California, 911 F.3d at 566 (ACA and its \n28 \n22 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 23 of 45\n \n1  regulations “require group health plans to cover contraceptive care without cost sharing”).  The \n2  United States government also has admitted as much in its consistent prior representations to the \n3  Supreme Court.  See Brief for Respondents at 25, Zubik, 136 S. Ct. at 1557 (2016) (Nos. 14-1418, \n4  14-1453, 14-1505, 15-35, 15-105, 15-119, 15-191) (recognizing “the generally applicable \n5  requirement to provide contraceptive coverage”); id. at 37–38 (recognizing that “[t]he Affordable \n6  Care Act itself imposes an obligation on insurers to provide contraceptive coverage, 42 U.S.C. \n7  300gg-13”).      \n8  Federal Defendants’ argument that the statute’s language requiring coverage “as provided” \n9  by the regulations confers unbridled discretion on the agencies to exempt anyone they see fit from \n10  providing coverage, Federal Opp. at 18–19, is inconsistent with the ACA’s mandate that women’s \n11  contraceptive coverage “shall” be provided by covered plans and issuers without cost sharing.  \n12  The statute’s use of the phrase “as provided for in comprehensive guidelines” simply cannot \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  reasonably be read as a Congressional delegation of the plenary authority claimed by the Federal \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Defendants.  Instead, Congress permitted HRSA, a health agency, to determine what “additional \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  preventive care and screenings” in those guidelines must be covered with respect to women.  See \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Catholic Health Care Sys. v. Burwell, 796 F.3d 207, 210 (2d Cir. 2015) (“The ACA does not \nS d nr\nee 17  specify what types of preventive care must be covered for female plan participants and \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  beneficiaries.  Instead, Congress left that issue to be determined via regulation by the [HRSA].”) \n19  (emphasis added), vacated and remanded, 136 S. Ct. 2450 (2016).  Without dispute, the guidelines \n20  continue to identify contraceptive services as among those for which health plans and insurers \n21  “shall, at a minimum provide coverage . . . and shall not impose any cost sharing requirements.”  \n22  See Health Res. & Serv. Admin., Women’s Preventive Services Guidelines, \n23  https://www.hrsa.gov/womens-guidelines-2016/index.html (last updated Oct. 2017).  Moreover, in \n24  2012, “[t]he Senate voted down the so-called conscience amendment, which would have enabled \n25  any employer or insurance provider to deny coverage based on its asserted ‘religious beliefs or \n26  moral convictions.’”  Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2789 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (citing 158 Cong. \n27  Rec. S539 (Feb. 9, 2012) and S1162–73 (Mar. 1, 2012)). \n28  Accordingly, the Court rejects the Federal Defendants’ claim that the ACA delegates to the \n23 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 24 of 45\n \n1  agencies complete discretion to implement any exemptions they choose, including those at issue \n2  here.  See Pennsylvania, 281 F.Supp.3d at 579 (rejecting government’s argument that “HRSA may \n3  determine not only the services covered by the ACA, but also the manner or reach of that \n4  coverage,” because “the ACA contains no statutory language allowing the Agencies to create such \n5  sweeping exemptions to the requirements to cover ‘preventive services,’ which, as interpreted by \n6  those same agencies, include mandatory no-cost coverage of contraceptive services”). \n7  To the extent the Federal Defendants rely on the existence of the church exemption \n8  instituted in 2013 to support their position, Federal Opp. at 18–19, the legality of that exemption is \n9  not before the Court.  The Court notes, however, that the church exemption was rooted in \n10  provisions of the Internal Revenue Code that apply to churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and \n11  conventions or associations of churches, as well as to the exclusively religious activities of any \n12  religious order.  See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,874 (classifying “an employer that [was] organized and \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  operate[d] as a nonprofit entity and [was] referred to in section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Code [as] a religious employer for purposes of the religious employer exemption.”).  While a court \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  could someday be presented with the question of whether the church exemption is uniquely \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  required by law given the special legal status afforded to churches and their integrated auxiliaries, \nS d nr\nee 17  the existence of that exemption simply does not mean that the agencies have boundless authority \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  to implement any other exemptions they choose.         \n19  b.  The Religious Exemption likely is not required by RFRA. \n20   Because the Women’s Health Amendment, including the requirement to cover the \n21  preventive care and screenings identified in the guidelines, is a law of general applicability, the \n22  next question is whether RFRA requires the government to relieve qualifying entities of the \n23  obligation to comply by providing the Religious Exemption, as opposed to the accommodation \n24  provided for under the pre-IFR version of the rules currently in force.  The Court finds that the \n25  Religious Exemption likely is not required by RFRA. \n26  “RFRA suspends generally applicable federal laws that ‘substantially burden a person’s \n27  exercise of religion’ unless the laws are ‘the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling \n28  governmental interest.’”  Oklevueha Native Amer. Church of Hawaii v. Lynch, 828 F.3d 1012, \n24 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 25 of 45\n \n1  1015 (9th Cir. 2016) (internal quotation and citation omitted).  The Ninth Circuit has held that \n2  “[u]nder RFRA, a ‘substantial burden’ is imposed only when individuals are forced to choose \n3  between following the tenets of their religion and receiving a governmental benefit . . . or coerced \n4  to act contrary to their religious beliefs by the threat of civil or criminal sanctions . . . .”  Navajo \n5  Nation v. United States Forest Serv., 535 F.3d 1058, 1070 (9th Cir. 2008).  The government “is \n6  not required to prove a compelling interest for its action or that its action involves the least \n7  restrictive means to achieve its purpose, unless the plaintiff first proves the government action \n8  substantially burdens his exercise of religion.”  Id. at 1069. \n9  The Federal Defendants and the Little Sisters argue that the current accommodation, under \n10  which eligible organizations are not required to contract, arrange, pay, or refer for contraceptive \n11  coverage, substantially burdens religious objectors’ exercise of religion.  Federal Opp. at 22; Little \n12  Sisters Opp. at 15 (contending that “RFRA mandates a broad religious exemption” from the \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  contraceptive coverage requirement).  Federal Defendants and the Little Sisters argue that even \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  requiring objectors to notify the government that they are opting out of the otherwise-applicable \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  obligation to cover contraceptive services for their female employees, students, or beneficiaries \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  makes them complicit in the provision of products incompatible with their religious beliefs.  \nS d nr\nee 17  Federal Opp. at 22 (“The accommodation, like the Mandate, imposes a substantial burden because \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  it requires some religious objectors to ‘act in a manner that they sincerely believe would make \n19  them complicit in a grave moral wrong as the price of avoiding a ruinous financial penalty.’”) \n20  (quoting Sharpe Holdings, Inc. v.

CNS Int’l Ministries, 84 U.S.L.W. \n22  3630, 2016 WL 2842448, at *1 (2016); Little Sisters Opp. at 16 (“The Little Sisters cannot, in \n23  good conscience, provide these services on their health benefits plan or authorize others to do so \n24  for them.”). \n25  While the Ninth Circuit has not considered this question, nine other courts of appeal have.  \n26  Of those courts, all other than the Eighth Circuit (in the Sharpe Holdings decision on which the \n27  Federal Defendants exclusively rely) concluded that the accommodation does not impose a \n28 \n25 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 26 of 45\n \n1  substantial burden on objectors’ exercise of religion.11  This Court agrees with the eight courts that \n2  so held, and finds that Plaintiffs are likely to prevail on this argument. \n3  First, whether a burden is substantial is an objective question:  a court “must assess the \n4  nature of a claimed burden on religious exercise to determine whether, as an objective legal \n5  matter, that burden is ‘substantial’ under RFRA.”  Catholic Health Care Sys., 796 F.3d at 217.12  \n6  In other words, “[w]hether a law substantially burdens religious exercise under RFRA is a \n7  question of law for courts to decide, not a question of fact.”  Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 247.  \n8  Importantly, the Court may not, and does not here, question the “sincerity of [a party’s] belief that \n9  providing, paying for, or facilitating access to contraceptive services is contrary to [its] faith,” or \n10  its judgment that “participation in the accommodation violates this belief.”  Catholic Health Care \n11  Sys., 796 F.3d at 217.  But “[w]hether the regulation objected to imposes a substantial burden is an \n12  altogether different inquiry.”  Id. at 218. \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  As several courts have noted, the Supreme Court’s decision in Hobby Lobby “did not \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  collapse the distinction between beliefs and substantial burden, such that the latter could be \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  established simply through the sincerity of the former.”  Catholic Health Care Sys., 796 F.3d at \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16 \nS d nr                                                  \nee 17 \ntinhtr 11 See Priests for Life v.

Only the Eighth \n23 \nCircuit has found that the religious accommodation as it existed before the promulgation of the \n2017 IFRs imposed a substantial burden on religious exercise under RFRA.  See Sharpe Holdings, \n24 \n801 F.3d at 945 (affirming grant of preliminary injunction to religious objectors because “they \n[were] likely to succeed on the merits of their RFRA challenge to the contraceptive mandate and \n25 \nthe accommodation regulations”), vacated sub nom.

Ct. \n2006 (2016).   \n27 \n12 While all eight of the decisions finding no substantial burden were vacated by Zubik or other \nSupreme Court decisions, the Court finds the analysis and reasoning of those cases highly \n28 \npersuasive.  The Eighth Circuit’s decision in Sharpe Holdings has been vacated as well. \n26 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 27 of 45\n \n1  218; see also Eternal Word, 818 F.3d at 1145 (noting that “nothing in RFRA or case law . . . \n2  allows a religious adherent to dictate to the courts what the law requires,” and explaining that \n3  “questions about what a law means are not the type of ‘difficult and important questions of \n4  religion and moral philosophy’ for which courts must defer to religious adherents”) (citing Hobby \n5  Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2778).                   \n6  Both before and after the Supreme Court’s decision in Wheaton College, all courts of \n7  appeal to consider the question, with the exception of the Eighth Circuit, have concluded that \n8  requiring religious objectors to notify the government of their objection to providing contraceptive \n9  coverage, so that the government can ensure that the responsible insurer or third-party \n10  administrator steps in to meet the ACA’s requirements, does not impose a substantial burden on \n11  religious exercise.  As the Eleventh Circuit explained post-Wheaton in Eternal Word, under the \n12  accommodation “the only action required of the eligible organization is opting out: literally, the \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  organization’s notification of its objection,” at which point all responsibilities related to \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  contraceptive coverage fall upon its insurer or TPA.  818 F.3d at 1149.  The Eleventh Circuit \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  noted that “such an opt out requirement is ‘typical of religious objection accommodations that \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  shift responsibility to non-objecting entities only after an objector declines to perform a task on \nS d nr\nee 17  religious grounds.’”  Id. (citing Little Sisters of the Poor, 794 F.3d at 1183). \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  The eight courts of appeal also found that an objector’s “complicity” argument does not \n19  establish a substantial burden, because it is the ACA and the guidelines that entitle plan \n20  participants and beneficiaries to contraceptive coverage, not any action taken by the objector.  As \n21  the Eternal Word court explained: \nThe ACA and the HRSA guidelines—not the opt out—are . . . the \n22  ‘linchpins’ of the contraceptive mandate because they entitle women \nwho are plan participants and beneficiaries covered by group health \n23  insurance plans to contraceptive coverage without cost sharing.  In \nother words, women are entitled to contraceptive coverage regardless \n24  of their employer’s action (or lack of action) with respect to seeking \nan accommodation.  Because a woman’s entitlement to contraceptive \n25  benefits does not turn on whether her eligible organization employer \nchooses to comply with the law (by providing contraceptive coverage \n26  or seeking an accommodation) or pay a substantial penalty (in the \nform of a tax) for noncompliance, we cannot say that the act of opting \n27  out imposes a substantial burden. \n28  818 F.3d at 1149.  See also, e.g., Little Sisters of the Poor, 794 F.3d at 1174 (“[S]hifting legal \n27 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 28 of 45\n \n1  responsibility to provide coverage away from the plaintiffs relieves rather than burdens their \n2  religious exercise.  The ACA and its implementing regulations entitle plan participants and \n3  beneficiaries to coverage whether or not the plaintiffs opt out.”); East Texas Baptist Univ. v. \n4  Burwell, 793 F.3d 449, 459 (5th Cir. 2015) (“[T]he plaintiffs claim that their completion of Form \n5  700 or submission of a notice to HHS will authorize or trigger payments for contraceptives.  Not \n6  so.  The ACA already requires contraceptive coverage . . . .”). \n7  The Eleventh Circuit in Eternal Word summarized its analysis by holding that it “simply \n8  [could] not say that RFRA affords the plaintiffs the right to prevent women from obtaining \n9  contraceptive coverage to which federal law entitles them based on the de minimis burden that the \n10  plaintiffs face in notifying the government that they have a religious objection.”  818 F.3d at 1150.  \n11  This Court agrees. \n12  Moreover, as several courts have noted, in Hobby Lobby the Supreme Court at least \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  suggested (without deciding) that the accommodation likely was not precluded by RFRA.  See, \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  e.g., Catholic Health Care Sys., 796 F.3d at 217 (“Indeed, in Hobby Lobby, the Supreme Court \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  identified this accommodation as a way to alleviate a substantial burden on the religious exercise \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  of for-profit corporations . . . .”), East Texas Baptist Univ., 793 F.3d at 462 (“The Hobby Lobby \nS d nr\nee 17  Court . . . actually suggested in dictum that the accommodation does not burden religious exercise \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  . . . .”).  Hobby Lobby described the accommodation as “effectively exempt[ing] certain religious \n19  nonprofit organizations . . . from the contraceptive mandate.”  134 S. Ct. at 2763.  The Court \n20  characterized the accommodation as “an approach that is less restrictive than requiring employers \n21  to fund contraceptive methods that violate their religious beliefs.”  Id. at 2782.  While making \n22  clear that it did not “decide today whether an approach of this type complies with RFRA for \n23  purposes of all religious claims,” the Court said that “[a]t a minimum, [the accommodation did] \n24  not impinge on the plaintiffs’ religious belief that providing insurance coverage for the \n25  contraceptives at issue here violates their religion, and it serves HHS’s stated interests equally \n26  well.”  Id.  Specifically, the Court said that “[u]nder the accommodation, the plaintiffs’ female \n27  employees would continue to receive contraceptive coverage without cost sharing for all FDA-\n28  approved contraceptives, and they would continue to ‘face minimal logistical and administrative \n28 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 29 of 45\n \n1  obstacles . . . because their employers’ insurers would be responsible for providing information \n2  and coverage . . . .”  Id. (citation omitted).  \n3  The Little Sisters raise two arguments to suggest that the reasoning referenced above \n4  should not control.  First, they contend that in the Zubik case, the government made factual \n5  concessions that “removed any basis for lower courts’ prior holding that the Mandate did not \n6  impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of objecting employers because the provision \n7  of contraceptives was separate from their plans.”  Little Sisters Opp. at 6.  Second, they point to \n8  what they characterize as “unanimous rulings” post-Zubik entering “permanent injunctions against \n9  the Mandate as a violation of RFRA.”  Id. at 16.13  The Court does not find either argument \n10  persuasive at this stage. \n11  With regard to the government’s Zubik “concession,” the Court cannot in the limited time \n12  available before the Final Rules are scheduled to take effect review the entirety of the Zubik record \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  to place the statements identified in context.  But even assessing on their face the handful of facts \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  proffered, it is not self-evident that the representations have the definitive effect posited by the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Little Sisters.  See id. at 6 (citing following exchange during the Zubik oral argument:  “Chief \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Justice Roberts: ‘You want the coverage for contraceptive services to be provided, I think as you \nS d nr\nee 17  said, seamlessly.  You want it to be in one insurance package. . . .  Is that a fair understanding of \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  the case?’  Solicitor General Verrilli:  “I think it is one fair understanding of the case.’”) (ellipses \n19  as in Little Sisters Opp.).  On the present record, the Court cannot conclude that the “one fair \n20  understanding” comment, or the other few representations cited, fatally undermined the core \n21  conclusion of the eight courts of appeal that requiring a religious objector simply to notify the \n22  government of its objection, consistent with Wheaton College, does not substantially burden \n23  religious exercise.  The Court thus believes it likely that the answer to the legal question posed in \n24  that on-point authority is not altered by the position taken by the government in Zubik.  This \n25  conclusion, like all of the Court’s preliminary analysis in this order, is subject to re-evaluation \n26 \n                                                 \n13 The Court notes that the district court in Pennsylvania found, post-Zubik, that the IFRs “are not \n27 \nrequired under RFRA because the Third Circuit—twice now—has foreclosed the Agencies’ legal \nconclusion that the Accommodation Process imposes a substantial burden.”  281 F.Supp.3d at 581.  \n28 \nThis decision undercuts the Little Sisters’ unanimity claim. \n29 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 30 of 45\n \n1  once a fuller record is developed.  See California, 911 F.3d at 584 (noting that “the fully \n2  developed factual record may be materially different from that initially before the district court”). \n3  Relatedly, the Court finds that nothing in the post-Zubik district court decisions cited by \n4  the Little Sisters compels the conclusion that the Religious Exemption was mandated by RFRA.  \n5  The Zubik remand order gave the parties the “opportunity to arrive at an approach going forward \n6  that accommodates petitioners’ religious exercise while at the same time ensuring that women \n7  covered by petitioners’ health plans ‘receive full and equal health coverage, including \n8  contraceptive coverage.’”  136 S. Ct. at 1560 (emphasis added).  While expressing “no view on \n9  the merits of the cases,” id., the Supreme Court said that “[n]othing in this opinion, or in the \n10  opinions or orders of the courts below, is to affect the ability of the Government to ensure that \n11  women covered by petitioners’ health plans ‘obtain, without cost, the full range of FDA approved \n12  contraceptives.’”  Id. at 1560–61 (quoting Wheaton College, 134 S. Ct. at 2807) (emphasis added).  \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  In her concurrence, Justice Sotomayor stressed her understanding that the majority opinion \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  “allows the lower courts to consider only whether existing or modified regulations could provide \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  seamless contraceptive coverage to petitioners’ employees, through petitioners’ insurance \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  companies, without any notice from petitioners.”  Zubik, 136 S. Ct. at 1561 (Sotomayor, J., \nS d nr\nee 17  concurring) (internal quotations and ellipses omitted). \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Following remand, however, as reflected in the IFRs and now the Final Rules, the Federal \n19  Defendants simply reversed their position and stopped defending the accommodation, and now \n20  seemingly disavow any obligation to ensure coverage under the ACA.  As a result, the post-Zubik \n21  orders were entered without objection by the government, based on the agencies’ new position that \n22  the accommodation violates RFRA.  See, e.g., Wheaton Coll. v. Azar, No. 1:13-cv-08910, Dkt. \n23  119 at 2 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 22, 2018) (noting that “[a]fter reconsideration of their position, Defendants \n24  now agree that enforcement of the currently operative rules regarding the ‘contraceptive mandate’ \n25  against employers with sincerely held religious objections would violate RFRA, and thus do not \n26  oppose Wheaton’s renewed motion for injunctive and declaratory relief”).  In other words, it \n27  appears to the Court that no party in these cases purported to represent, or even consider the \n28  substantial interests of, the women who now will be deprived of “full and equal health coverage, \n30 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 31 of 45\n \n1  including contraceptive coverage.”  Cf. Zubik, 136 S. Ct. at 1560.  Counsel for the Little Sisters \n2  confirmed at oral argument that none of those decisions have been appealed (presumably for the \n3  same reason).  So the eight appellate courts upon whose reasoning this Court relies have not had \n4  the opportunity to decide whether any subsequent developments would change their conclusions.  \n5  For all of these reasons, the Court finds that nothing about the post-Zubik orders cited by the Little \n6  Sisters changes its conclusion that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their argument that the Final \n7  Rules are not mandated by RFRA. \n8  c.  There are serious questions going to the merits as to whether the \nReligious Exemption is otherwise permissible. \n9 \nThe Federal Defendants and the Little Sisters further argue that even if the Religious \n10 \nExemption is not required by RFRA, the agencies have discretion under RFRA to implement it.  \n11 \nFederal Opp. at 21 (“[N]othing in RFRA prohibits the Agencies from now employing the more \n12 \na \ntr in straightforward choice of an exemption—much like the existing and unchallenged exemption for \nuoro 13 \nC tfila churches.”); Little Sisters Opp. at 17 (“RFRA thus contemplates that the government may choose \ncC 14 \ni\nrts fo to grant discretionary benefits or exemptions to religious groups over and above those which are \niD tc 15 \n sir strictly required by RFRA.”).  As accurately summarized by the Little Sisters, the question is thus \net\ntatsiD 16 \nS d nr whether Congress has “delegated authority to the agencies to create exemptions to protect \nee 17 \nth\nintr religious exercise,” such that RFRA “operates as a floor on religious accommodation, not a \nUo\nN 18 \nceiling.”  Little Sisters Opp. at 17.  While addressed only relatively briefly by the parties, this \n19 \nargument raises what appears to be a complex issue at the intersection of RFRA, Free Exercise, \n20 \nand Establishment Clause jurisprudence. \n21 \n The Court begins with a foundational premise: what the government is permitted to do \n22 \nunder a statute or the Constitution presents a pure question of law for the courts, and the agencies’ \n23 \nviews on this legal question are entitled to no deference (except to the extent required by Chevron \n24 \nas to statutory interpretation).  See Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2775 n.30 (noting that “conscience \n25 \namendment” rejected by Congress “would not have subjected religious-based objections to the \n26 \njudicial scrutiny called for by RFRA, in which a court must consider not only the burden of a \n27 \nrequirement on religious adherents, but also the government’s interest and how narrowly tailored \n28 \n31 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 32 of 45\n \n1  the requirement is”); see also Board of Trustees of Univ. of Alabama v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 365 \n2  (2001) (recognizing the “long-settled principle that it is the responsibility of this Court, not \n3  Congress, to define the substance of constitutional guarantees” (citing City of Boerne v. Flores, \n4  521 U.S. 507, 519–24 (1997)); Snoqualmie Indian Tribe, 545 F.3d at 1212–13 (“An agency’s \n5  interpretation or application of a statute is a question of law reviewed de novo,” subject to \n6  Chevron deference to agency’s permissible construction if statute is silent or ambiguous on a \n7  particular point).  The Little Sisters acknowledged at oral argument that they do not contend the \n8  Court owes Chevron deference to the agencies’ interpretation of RFRA.   \n9  On the other hand, the Federal Defendants assert, relying on Ricci v. DeStefano, 557 U.S. \n10  557, 585 (2009), that “[i]f agencies were legally prohibited from offering an exemption unless \n11  they concluded that no other possible accommodation would be consistent with RFRA, the result \n12  would be protracted and unnecessary litigation.”  Federal Opp. at 21–22.  This argument is neither \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  supported by the cited authority nor relevant. \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  First, Ricci does not support the Federal Defendants’ argument.  Ricci involved a city’s \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  decision not to certify the results of a promotion examination taken by its firefighters.  557 U.S. at \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  562.  The city based its decision on its apparent fear that it would be sued for adopting a practice \nS d nr\nee 17  that had a disparate impact on minority firefighters, in violation of Title VII.  Id. at 563.  The \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Supreme Court characterized its analysis as focused on how to “resolve any conflict between the \n19  disparate-treatment and disparate-impact provisions of Title VII.”  Id. at 584.  The Court found \n20  that “applying the strong-basis-in-evidence standard to Title VII gives effect to both the disparate-\n21  treatment and disparate impact provisions, allowing violations of one in the name of compliance \n22  with the other only in certain narrow circumstances”—specifically, when a government actor had \n23  a strong basis in evidence to conclude that race-conscious action was necessary to remedy past \n24  racial discrimination.  Id. at 582–83.  The Court described this standard as limiting employers’ \n25  discretion in making race-based decisions “to cases in which there is a strong basis in evidence of \n26  disparate-impact liability,” but said it was “not so restrictive that it allows employers to act only \n27  when there is a provable, actual violation.”  Id. at 583.  Accordingly, the Court “h[e]ld only that \n28  under Title VII, before an employer can engage in intentional discrimination for the asserted \n32 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 33 of 45\n \n1  purpose of avoiding or remedying an unintentional disparate impact, the employer must have a \n2  strong basis in evidence to believe it will be subject to disparate-impact liability if it fails to take \n3  the race-conscious, discriminatory action.”  Id. at 585.  \n4  The Court does not view Ricci as shedding any light on whether a federal agency has \n5  plenary discretion under RFRA to grant any exemption it chooses from an otherwise generally-\n6  applicable law passed by Congress.  The Federal Defendants cite no case applying Ricci in the \n7  RFRA context, or otherwise engaging in an analysis comparable to the Supreme Court’s in that \n8  case.      \n9  Second, and more fundamentally, Federal Defendants’ argument is irrelevant, because the \n10  courts, not the agencies, are the arbiters of what the law and the Constitution require.  The Court \n11  questions the Little Sisters’ contention that RFRA effected a wholesale delegation to executive \n12  agencies of the power to create exemptions to laws of general applicability in the first instance, \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  based entirely on their own view of what the law requires.14  As this case definitively \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  demonstrates, such views can change dramatically based on little more than a change in \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  administration.  In any event, there is no dispute that both the prior and current Administrations \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  have contended that they have administered the ACA in a manner consistent with RFRA.  But the \nS d nr\nee 17  courts are not concerned, at all, with the Federal Defendants’ desire to “avoid litigation,” \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  especially where that avoidance means depriving a large number of women of their statutory rights \n19  under the ACA.  Rather, the courts have a duty to independently decide whether the Final Rules \n20  comport with statutory and Constitutional requirements, as they have done in many analogous \n21  cases involving RFRA, and the Court rejects the Federal Defendants’ suggestion that “an entity \n22 \n                                                 \n23 \n14 The Court notes that Guam v. Guerrero, 290 F.3d 1210 (9th Cir. 2002), the case cited by the \nLittle Sisters, addressed Congress’s power to carve out religious exemptions from statutes of \n24 \ngeneral applicability.  It is true that the ACA is subject to the requirements of RFRA.  See Hobby \nLobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2775 n.30 (explaining that “any Federal statutory law adopted after November \n25 \n16, 1993 is subject to RFRA unless such law explicitly excludes such application by reference to \nRFRA (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-3(b)) (internal quotations and emphasis omitted).  But here, \n26 \nas noted earlier, in 2012 Congress declined to adopt a “conscience amendment” authorizing a \n“blanket exemption for religious or moral objectors” that was similar in many ways to the Final \n27 \nRules at issue here.  See id. at n.37 (majority opinion) and 2789 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).  \nWhether Congress could choose to amend the ACA to include exemptions like those in the Final \n28 \nRules is not before the Court in this case. \n33 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 34 of 45\n \n1  faced with potentially conflicting legal obligations should be afforded some leeway,” Federal Opp. \n2  at 21.  Ultimately, this Court (and quite possibly the Supreme Court) will have to decide the legal \n3  questions presented in this case, but no “leeway” will be given to the government’s current \n4  position in doing so.          \n5  Moving to the substance of the issue, the Court first notes that the Ninth Circuit has held \n6  that a plaintiff’s “failure to demonstrate a substantial burden under RFRA necessarily means that \n7  [it has] failed to establish a violation of the Free Exercise Clause, as RFRA’s prohibition on \n8  statutes that burden religion is stricter than that contained in the Free Exercise Clause.”  Fernandez \n9  v. Mukasey, 520 F.3d 965, 966 n.1 (9th Cir. 2008).  This holding is not dispositive of the dispute \n10  here, however, because the Supreme Court has said that “‘there is room for play in the joints’ \n11  between the Clauses, some space for legislative action neither compelled by the Free Exercise \n12  Clause nor prohibited by the Establishment Clause.”  Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 719 \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  (2005) (internal quotation and citation omitted). \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  As the Little Sisters note, “[g]ranting government funding, benefits, or exemptions, to the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  extent permissible under the Establishment Clause, shall not constitute a violation” of RFRA.  42 \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  U.S.C. § 2000bb-4.  But the Supreme Court has explained that “[a]t some point, accommodation \nS d nr\nee 17  may devolve into ‘an unlawful fostering of religion.’”  Corp. of Presiding Bishop of Church of \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. Amos, 483 U.S. 327, 334–35 (1987) (quoting Hobbie v. \n19  Unemployment Appeals Comm’n of Fla., 480 U.S. 136, 145 (1987)).  That is one of the core \n20  disputes here:  given its plain impact on women’s entitlement to coverage under the ACA, is the \n21  Religious Exemption permissible under RFRA even if it is not mandated by RFRA?  The Court \n22  finds that Plaintiffs have raised at least “serious questions going to the merits” as to this legal \n23  question.  Alliance for the Wild Rockies, 632 F.3d at 1131–32. \n24  The Court knows of no decision that has squarely addressed this issue in the context of the \n25  ACA.  As the Court has discussed above, the Religious Exemption has the effect of depriving \n26  female employees, students and other beneficiaries connected to exempted religious objectors of \n27  their statutory right under the ACA to seamlessly-provided contraceptive coverage at no cost.  \n28  That deprivation appears to occur without even requiring any direct notice to the women affected \n34 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 35 of 45\n \n1  by an objector’s decision to assert the Religious Exemption.  See 83 Fed. Reg. at 57,558.  Courts, \n2  including the Supreme Court in Hobby Lobby, have recognized that a court evaluating a RFRA \n3  claim must “take adequate account of the burdens a requested accommodation may impose on \n4  nonbeneficiaries.”  Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2781 n.37 (citing Cutter, 544 U.S. at 720 (internal \n5  quotations omitted)); see also Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 266 (“When the interests of religious \n6  adherents collide with an individual’s access to a government program supported by a compelling \n7  interest, RFRA calls on the government to reconcile the competing interests.  In so doing, \n8  however, RFRA does not permit religious exercise to ‘unduly restrict other persons, such as \n9  employees, in protecting their own interests, interest the law deems compelling.’”) (citing Hobby \n10  Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2786–87 (Kennedy, J., concurring)); Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 272 \n11  (“Limiting the exemption, but making the [accommodation] opt out available, limits the burdens \n12  that flow from organizations ‘subjecting their employees to the religious views of the employer.’”) \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  (citing 77 Fed. Reg. at 8,728 (February 2012 final rule adopting definition of “religious employer” \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  as set forth in 2011 IFR)). \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  In Cutter, the Supreme Court, in rejecting a facial constitutional attack on the Religious \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, cited Estate of Thornton v. Caldor, Inc., 472 U.S. 703 \nS d nr\nee 17  (1985), for the principle that courts “[p]roperly applying [RLUIPA] must take adequate account of \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  the burdens a requested accommodation may impose on nonbeneficiaries.”  544 U.S. at 720.  The \n19  Cutter Court noted that if inmate requests for religious accommodations “impose[d] unjustified \n20  burdens on other institutionalized persons,” “adjudication in as-applied challenges would be in \n21  order.”  Id. at 726.  In dissent in Hobby Lobby, Justice Ginsburg observed that “[n]o tradition, and \n22  no prior decision under RFRA, allows a religion-based exemption when the accommodation \n23  would be harmful to others—here, the very persons the contraceptive coverage requirement was \n24  designed to protect.”  134 S. Ct. at 2801 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).  The Hobby Lobby majority, in \n25  turn, said that its holding “need not result in any detrimental effect on any third party,” because \n26  “the Government can readily arrange for other methods of providing contraceptives, without cost \n27  sharing, to employees who are unable to obtain them under their health-insurance plans due to \n28  their employers’ religious objections,” including by offering the accommodation.  134 S. Ct. at \n35 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 36 of 45\n \n1  2781 n.37 (citing discussion at 2781–82).   \n2    The arguments of the Federal Defendants, and especially the Little Sisters, thus raise \n3  questions that the Supreme Court did not reach in Hobby Lobby, Zubik, or Wheaton College.  \n4  There is substantial debate among commentators as to how to assess the legality of \n5  accommodations not mandated by RFRA when those accommodations impose harms on third \n6  parties, given the statute’s directive that it does not preclude accommodations allowed by the \n7  Establishment Clause.  Compare Frederick Mark Gedicks & Rebecca G. Van Tassell, RFRA \n8  Exemptions from the Contraception Mandate: An Unconstitutional Accommodation of Religion, \n9  49 Harv. C.R.-C.L. L. Rev. 343 (2014) with Carl H. Esbeck, Do Discretionary Religious \n10  Exemptions Violate the Establishment Clause?, 106 Ky. L.J. 603 (2018).  Understandably, given \n11  the large number of substantive and procedural issues that must be addressed at the preliminary \n12  injunction stage, the parties have provided relatively brief arguments on this central question of \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  law.  See Mot. At 14–15; Federal Opp. at 20–23; Little Sisters Opp. at 17–19. \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  In light of the discussion in Hobby Lobby and Cutter regarding the requirement that a court \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  consider harm to third parties when evaluating an accommodation claim under RFRA, the Court \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  concludes under Alliance that serious questions going to the merits have been raised by the \nS d nr\nee 17  Plaintiffs as to their APA claim that the Religious Exemption is contrary to law.  The Alliance \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  standard recognizes that the “district court at the preliminary injunction stage is in a much better \n19  position to predict the likelihood of harm than the likelihood of success.”  Leiva-Perez v. Holder, \n20  640 F.3d 962, 968 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Alliance for the Wild Rockies, 632 F.3d at 1139 \n21  (Mosman, J., concurring)).  As the Ninth Circuit explained in a pre-Alliance case applying the \n22  standard, “‘serious questions’ refers to questions which cannot be resolved one way or the other at \n23  the hearing on the injunction and as to which the court perceives a need to preserve the status quo \n24  lest one side prevent resolution of the questions or execution of any judgment by altering the \n25  status quo.”  Republic of the Philippines v. Marcos, 862 F.2d 1355, 1362 (9th Cir. 1988).  “Serious \n26  questions are ‘substantial, difficult and doubtful, as to make them a fair ground for litigation and \n27  thus for more deliberative investigation.’”  Id. (quoting Hamilton Watch Co. v. Benrus Watch \n28  Co., 206 F.2d 738, 740 (2d Cir. 1952) (Frank, J.)).  Under these circumstances, the Court finds \n36 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 37 of 45\n \n1  that this case involves just such substantial and difficult questions. \n2  This is especially true given the Federal Defendants’ complete reversal on the key question \n3  of whether the government has a compelling interest in providing seamless and cost-free \n4  contraceptive coverage to women under the ACA.  The Hobby Lobby majority assumed, without \n5  deciding, that “the interest in guaranteeing cost-free access to the four challenged contraceptive \n6  methods is compelling within the meaning of RFRA.”  134 S. Ct. at 2780.  Justice Kennedy \n7  concurred, stating that it was “important to confirm that a premise of the Court’s opinion is its \n8  assumption that the HHS regulation here at issue furthers a legitimate and compelling interest in \n9  the health of female employees.”  Id. at 2786 (Kennedy, J., concurring).  Until the reversal that led \n10  to the IFRs and Final Rules, the agencies agreed that this interest was compelling.  See \n11  Supplemental Brief for Respondents at 1, Zubik v. Burwell, 136 S. Ct. 1557 (2016) (No. 14-1418), \n12  2016 WL 1445915, at *1 (explaining that rules in existence in April 2016 “further[ed] the \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  compelling interest in ensuring that women covered by every type of health plan receive full and \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  equal health coverage, including contraceptive coverage”). \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  The Court believes Plaintiffs are likely correct that “the Rules provide no new facts and no \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  meaningful discussion that would discredit their prior factual findings establishing the beneficial \nS d nr\nee 17  and essential nature of contraceptive healthcare for women,” Reply at 11.  Instead, the Final Rules \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  on this point rest, at bottom, on new legal assertions by the agencies.  See, e.g., 83 Fed. Reg. at \n19  57,547 (“[T]he Departments now believe the administrative record on which the Mandate rested \n20  was—and remains—insufficient to meet the high threshold to establish a compelling \n21  governmental interest in ensuring that women covered by plans of objecting organizations receive \n22  cost-free coverage through those plans.”).  Given the “serious reliance interests” of women who \n23  would lose coverage to which they are statutorily entitled if the Final Rules go into effect, the \n24  Court believes that Plaintiffs are also likely to prevail on their claim that the agencies failed to \n25  provide “a reasoned explanation . . . for disregarding facts and circumstances that underlay or were \n26  engendered by the prior policy.”  FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515–16 \n27  (2009).  As this case proceeds to a merits determination, the Court will have to determine how to \n28  develop the relevant record regarding the compelling interest question.  And the parties’ positions \n37 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 38 of 45\n \n1  on the legal issues described above will need to be laid out in substantially greater detail for the \n2  Court to sufficiently address the merits of this claim on a full record in the next stages of the case. \n3  2.  Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in showing that the Moral Exemption is \n“not in accordance with” the ACA, and thus violates the APA. \n4 \nFurther, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their argument that the Moral Exemption is not \n5 \nin accordance with the ACA.  In contrast to the Religious Exemption, there is no dispute that the \n6 \nMoral Exemption implicates neither RFRA nor the Religion Clauses of the Constitution.  Despite \n7 \nthis, Intervenor March for Life’s brief focuses primarily on defending the Religious Exemption, to \n8 \nwhich March for Life is not entitled.  See March for Life Opp. at 3–4 (acknowledging that March \n9 \nfor Life is a “pro-life, non-religious entit[y]”; compare March for Life Opp. at 6 (“RFRA requires \n10 \nthe religious exemption”), 10 (“[T]he Final Rules are an entirely permissible accommodation of \n11 \nreligion, which as a general matter does not violate the Establishment Clause.”), 10 (“[T]he Final \n12 \na \ntr in Rules do not compel women to participate in the religious beliefs of their employers, but rather \nuoro 13 \nC tfila merely ensure that a religious employer will not be conscripted to provide what his or her \ncC 14 \ni\nrts fo conscience will not permit.”).  The main purpose of the March for Life brief appears to be to \niD tc 15 \n sir establish that the Religious Exemption could not possibly run afoul of the Establishment Clause \net\ntatsiD 16 \nS d nr because the Moral Exemption exists.  See id. at 9 (“[T]he Final Rules protect both religious . . . \nee 17 \nth\nintr and non-religious . . . actors, thereby dispelling any argument that the federal government intended \nUo\nN 18 \nto advance religious interests.”).   \n19 \nWhatever complexities may exist with regard to the Religious Exemption, as discussed \n20 \nabove, they do not apply to the Moral Exemption.  Congress mandated the coverage that is the \n21 \nsubject matter of this dispute, and rejected a “conscience amendment” that would exempt entities \n22 \nlike March for Life from this generally-applicable statutory requirement.  The Final Rules note \n23 \nthat “[o]ver many decades, Congress has protected conscientious objections including based on \n24 \nmoral convictions in the context of health care and human services, and including health coverage, \n25 \neven as it has sought to promote access to health services.”  83 Fed. Reg. at 57,594.  But that \n26 \nhighlights the problem:  here, it was the agencies, not Congress, that implemented the Moral \n27 \nExemption, and it is inconsistent with the language and purpose of the statute it purports to \n28 \n38 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 39 of 45\n \n1  interpret.  The Court finds that Plaintiffs are likely to prevail on their claim that the Moral \n2  Exemption is contrary to the ACA, and thus unlawful under the APA.  Again, the Court does not \n3  dispute the sincerity, or minimize the substance, of March for Life’s moral objection.      \n4  3.  Plaintiffs are likely to suffer irreparable harm unless the Court enjoins \nthe Final Rules. \n5 \nThe Court finds that the Plaintiffs are likely to suffer irreparable harm unless the Final \n6 \nRules are enjoined to maintain the status quo pending resolution of the case on the merits.  In its \n7 \norder remanding this case, the Ninth Circuit found that “it is reasonably probable that the states \n8 \nwill suffer economic harm from the IFRs.”  California, 911 F.3d at 581; see also id. at 571 (“The \n9 \nstates show, with reasonable probability, that the IFRs will first lead to women losing employer-\n10 \nsponsored contraceptive coverage, which will then result in economic harm to the states.”).  As the \n11 \nNinth Circuit explained, economic harm is not recoverable for a violation of the APA.  See id. at \n12 \na \ntr in 581 (citing 5 U.S.C. § 702 (permitting “relief other than money damages”)); see also Haines v. \nuoro 13 \nC tfila Fed. Motor Carrier Safety Admin., 814 F.3d 417, 426 (6th Cir. 2016) (federal courts do not have \ncC 14 \ni\nrts fo jurisdiction to adjudicate suits seeking monetary damages under the APA).15   \niD tc 15 \n sir The States have equally shown a likelihood of irreparable injury from the Final Rules.  The \net\ntatsiD 16 \nS d nr Final Rules themselves estimate that tens of thousands of women nationwide will lose \nee 17 \nth\nintr contraceptive coverage, and suggest that these women may be able to obtain substitute services at \nUo\nN 18 \nTitle X family-planning clinics.  See 83 Fed. Reg. at 57,551 n.26 (up to 126,400 women \n19 \nnationwide will lose coverage as result of Religious Exemption); id. at 57,551 (suggesting Title X \n20 \nfamily-planning clinics as alternative to insurer-provided contraceptives).  The States have \n21 \nsubmitted substantial evidence documenting the fiscal harm that will flow to them as a result of \n22 \nthe Final Rules.  See, e.g., Cantwell Decl., Dkt. No. 174-4 ¶¶ 16–18 (Final Rules will result in \n23 \nmore women becoming eligible for California’s Family Planning, Access, Care, and Treatment \n24 \nprogram, meaning that “state dollars may be diverted to provide” contraceptive coverage); Tobias \n25 \nDecl., Dkt. No. 174-33 ¶ 5 (exemptions in Final Rules “will result in more women receiving” New \n26 \n27 \n                                                 \n15 The Federal Defendants contend the Ninth Circuit’s “conclusion was in error,” Federal Opp. at \n28 \n24, presumably to preserve their argument for the record.   \n39 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 40 of 45\n \n1  York Family Planning Program services, thus putting program at “risk [of] being overwhelmed by \n2  the increase in patients”); Rattay Decl., Dkt. No. 174-30 ¶ 7 (Final Rules “will contribute to an \n3  increase in Delaware’s nationally high unintended pregnancy rate as women forego needed \n4  contraception and other services”); Moracco Decl., Dkt. No. 174-23 ¶ 5 (State of Minnesota “may \n5  bear a financial risk when women lose contraceptive coverage” because state is obligated to pay \n6  for child delivery and newborn care for children born to low-income mothers).  Thus, Plaintiffs \n7  have satisfied the irreparable harm prong of the inquiry.   \n8  4.  The balance of the equities tips sharply in Plaintiffs’ favor, and the \npublic interest favors granting preliminary injunctive relief to preserve \n9  the status quo pending resolution of the merits. \n10 \nPlaintiffs also prevail on the balance of equities and public interest analyses.  When the \n11 \ngovernment is a party to a case in which a preliminary injunction is sought, the balance of the \n12 \na \ntr in equities and public interest factors merge.  Drakes Bay Oyster Co. v. Jewell, 747 F.3d 1073, 1092 \nuoro 13 \nC tfila (9th Cir. 2014).  Broadly speaking, there are two interests at stake in that balance: the interest in \ncC 14 \ni\nrts fo ensuring that health plans cover contraceptive services with no cost-sharing, as provided for under \niD tc 15 \n sir the ACA, and the interest in protecting “the sincerely held religious [and moral] objections of \net\ntatsiD 16 \nS d nr certain entities and individuals.”  See 83 Fed. Reg. at 57,537; see also 83 Fed. Reg. at 57,593.   \nee 17 \nth\nintr   With these interests in mind, the Court concludes that the balance of equities tips sharply \nUo\nN 18 \nin Plaintiffs’ favor.  As the Court found previously, Plaintiffs face potentially dire public health \n19 \nand fiscal consequences from the implementation of the Final Rules.  Plaintiffs point out that \n20 \nunder the Final Rules, contraceptive coverage for employees and beneficiaries in existing health \n21 \nplans could be dropped with 60 days’ notice that the employer is revoking its use of the \n22 \naccommodation process, or when a new plan year begins.  See Mot. at 20.  These changes likely \n23 \nwill increase the Plaintiffs’ costs of providing contraceptive care to their residents.  See \n24 \nDeclaration of Phuong H. Nguyen, Dkt. No. 174-26 ¶¶ 11–15 (Final Rules likely to increase \n25 \ndemand for no- and low-cost contraception services funded by State of California); Declaration of \n26 \nJennifer Welch, Dkt. No. 174-35 ¶¶ 10–12 (some women who lose insurer-provided contraceptive \n27 \ncoverage as result of Final Rules likely to enroll in State of Illinois’s Medicaid program).   \n28 \n40 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 41 of 45\n \n1  Plaintiffs persuasively submit that the suggestion in the Final Rules that women turn to Title X \n2  clinics actually will increase the number of women who will have to be covered by state programs.  \n3  Mot. at 23 (citing Cantwell Decl., Dkt. No. 174-4 ¶¶ 16–18; Tobias Decl., Dkt. No. 174-33 ¶ 5).  \n4  Moreover, Plaintiffs face substantial costs stemming from a higher rate of unintended pregnancies \n5  that are likely to occur if women lose access to the seamless, no-cost contraceptive coverage \n6  afforded under the rules now in place.  See Alexander-Scott Decl, Dkt. No. 174-7 ¶ 3 (unintended \n7  pregnancies likely to result from Final Rules will impose costs on State of Rhode Island); Wilson \n8  Decl., Dkt. No. 174-38 ¶ 5 (unintended pregnancies likely to result from Final Rules will impose \n9  costs on State of North Carolina).  In essence, for many thousands of women in the Plaintiff \n10  States, the mandatory coverage structure now in place under the ACA will disappear, requiring \n11  them to piece together coverage from Title X clinics or state agencies, or to pay for such coverage \n12  themselves.  This reality will cause substantial, and irreparable, harm to the Plaintiff States, and \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  their showing compellingly establishes that the Final Rules do not in practice “ensur[e] that \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  women covered by petitioners’ health plans ‘receive full and equal health coverage, including \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  contraceptive coverage.’”  Cf. Zubik, 136 S. Ct. at 1560.    \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  On the other hand, maintaining the status quo that preceded the Final Rules and the 2017 \nS d nr\nee 17  IFRs—in which eligible entities still would be permitted to avail themselves of the exemption or \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  the accommodation—does not constitute an equivalent harm to the Federal Defendants or \n19  Intervenors pending resolution of the merits.  The Federal Defendants cite Maryland v. King, 133 \n20  S. Ct. 1, 3 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., in chambers), for the premise that “the government suffers \n21  irreparable institutional injury whenever its laws are set aside by a court.”  Federal Opp. at 24.  \n22  But Maryland actually held that “any time a State is enjoined by a court from effectuating statutes \n23  enacted by representatives of its people, it suffers a form of irreparable injury.”  133 S. Ct. at 3 \n24  (citation omitted).  Here, of course, the “representatives of the people”—the United States \n25  Congress—passed the ACA, and the precise question in this case is whether the Executive’s \n26  attempt to implement the Final Rules is inconsistent with Congress’s directives. \n27  The Federal Defendants also note—correctly—that “the government and the public at large \n28  have a substantial interest in protecting religious liberty and conscience.”  Federal Opp. at 24; see \n41 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 42 of 45\n \n1  also California v. Azar, 911 F.3d at 582–83 (acknowledging that “free exercise of religion and \n2  conscience is undoubtedly, fundamentally important,” and recognizing that “[r]egardless of \n3  whether the accommodation violates RFRA, some employers have sincerely-held religious and \n4  moral objections to the contraceptive coverage requirement.”).  However, it is significant that after \n5  the Court enjoined the IFRs in December 2017, the Federal Defendants and Intervenors stipulated \n6  to a stay of this case pending resolution of their appeals, which kept the existing structure, \n7  including the accommodation, in place for a year and delayed resolution of the merits of the \n8  claims.  On balance, because the Court has concluded that Plaintiffs are likely to show that the \n9  Final Rules are not mandated by RFRA, and that the existing accommodation does not \n10  substantially burden religious exercise, it finds that maintaining the status quo for the time being, \n11  pending a prompt resolution of the merits of Plaintiffs’ claims, is warranted based on the record \n12  presented.16  Plaintiffs have shown that the balance of equities tips sharply in their favor, and that \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  the public interest favors granting a preliminary injunction.  Because the standard set forth in \nCfi\n tclaC 14  Winter is met, the Court grants Plaintiffs’ motion.17         \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  D.  This Preliminary Injunction Enjoins Enforcement of the Final Rules Only In \n sir\net the Plaintiff States. \ntatsiD 16 \nS d nr Plaintiffs ask the Court to grant a nationwide injunction, contending that the Court “cannot \nee 17 \nth\nintr simply draw a line around the plaintiff States and impose an injunction only as to those States to \nUo\nN 18 \nensure complete relief.”  Mot. at 25.  Federal Defendants and March for Life respond that even if \n19 \nthe Court grants equitable relief, a nationwide injunction is inappropriate.  See Federal Opp. at 25; \n20 \nMarch for Life Opp. at 22–24.  \n21 \n “The scope of an injunction is within the broad discretion of the district court.”  \n22 \n23 \n                                                 \n16 Without question, religious and moral objectors similarly situated to the Little Sisters and March \n24 \nfor Life are directly affected by a preliminary injunction against the implementation of the Final \nRules.  The Court notes that these two particular intervenors, and apparently many others, are \n25 \nsubject to court orders prohibiting the Federal Defendants from enforcing the mandate or \naccommodation requirements against them.  Those orders (and any other similar orders) are \n26 \nunaffected by the injunction entered here.  See Little Sisters Opp. at 7 (listing orders); March for \nLife Opp. at 4.  \n27 \n17 Because the Court finds that entry of a preliminary injunction is warranted on the basis \ndiscussed above, it need not at this time consider the additional bases for injunctive relief \n28 \nadvanced by Plaintiffs. \n42 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 43 of 45\n \n1  TrafficSchool.com, Inc. v. Edriver Inc., 653 F.3d 820, 829 (9th Cir. 2011).  “Crafting a preliminary \n2  injunction is an exercise of discretion and judgment, often dependent as much on the equities of a \n3  given case as the substance of the legal issues it presents.”  Trump v. Int’l Refugee Assistance \n4  Project, 137 S. Ct. 2080, 2087 (2017).  A nationwide injunction is proper when “necessary to give \n5  Plaintiffs a full expression of their rights.”  Hawaii v. Trump, 878 F.3d 662, 701 (9th Cir. 2017), \n6  rev’d on other grounds, 138 S. Ct. 2392 (2018).   \n7  This is, of course, not the first time the Court has had to determine the proper geographic \n8  scope of a preliminary injunction in this case.  In response to the Plaintiffs’ challenge to the IFRs, \n9  the Court issued a nationwide injunction.  See Dkt. No. 105 at 28–29.  On appeal, the Ninth \n10  Circuit held that the nationwide scope of the injunction was overbroad and an abuse of discretion.  \n11  California, 911 F.3d at 585. \n12  In doing so, the Ninth Circuit made clear that injunctive relief “must be no broader and no \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  narrower than necessary to redress the injury shown by the plaintiff states.”  Id.   The court \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  reasoned that prohibiting enforcement of the IFRs in the Plaintiff States only, rather than across \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  the entire country, “would provide complete relief” because it “would prevent the economic harm \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  extensively detailed in the record.”  Id. at 584.  The court cautioned that “[d]istrict judges must \nS d nr\nee 17  require a showing of nationwide impact or sufficient similarity to the plaintiff states to foreclose \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  litigation in other districts.”  Id.  And the Ninth Circuit stressed that “nationwide injunctive relief \n19  may be inappropriate where a regulatory challenge involves important or difficult questions of \n20  law, which might benefit from development in different factual contexts and in multiple decisions \n21  by the various courts of appeals.”  Id. at *15 (citation omitted).  As discussed at length above, the \n22  issues presented on this motion, much more than the notice-and-comment requirement that was \n23  the basis of the Court’s prior order granting a preliminary injunction, implicate exactly these types \n24  of important and difficult questions of law.  \n25  The Court fully recognizes that limiting the scope of this injunction to the Plaintiff States \n26  means that women in other states are at risk of losing access to cost-free contraceptives when the \n27  Final Rules take effect.  Plaintiffs also contend that women who reside in their States may still \n28  lose their entitlement to cost-free contraceptives because they receive their health insurance \n43 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-05783-HSG   Document 234   Filed 01/13/19   Page 44 of 45\n \n1  coverage from an employer or family member located elsewhere.  But Plaintiffs provide little \n2  evidence of the effect this will have on their own States.  Cf. Declaration of Dr. Jennifer Childs-\n3  Roshak, Dkt. No. 174-8 ¶ 16 (discussing effect in Massachusetts); Declaration of Robert Pomales, \n4  Dkt. No. 174-28 ¶ 9 (same); Mot. at 25 n.24 (California hosts 25,000 students from out-of-state \n5  and New York hosts 35,000).  Plaintiffs do note that women who live in the Plaintiff States may \n6  live in one state but commute to another state for work.  See Reply at 15 n.17 (noting high \n7  percentage of Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, and District of Columbia residents who commute to \n8  work in another state).   \n9  On the present record, the Court cannot conclude that the high threshold set by the Ninth \n10  Circuit for a nationwide injunction, in light of the concerns articulated in the California opinion, \n11  has been met.  The Court also finds it significant that a judge in the District of Massachusetts \n12  found in 2018 that the state lacked standing to proceed as to claims similar to those here, in an \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  order that has been appealed to the First Circuit.  See Massachusetts v. United States Dep’t of \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Health & Human Servs., 301 F. Supp. 3d 248, 250 (D. Mass. 2018).  This parallel litigation \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  highlights the potential direct legal conflicts that could result were this Court to enter a nationwide \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  injunction.
