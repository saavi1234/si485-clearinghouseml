    "summary": "<p>This case concerns U.S. immigration and family reunification policies.</p>\r\n<p>A group of Honduran and Guatemalan minors, guardians, and sponsors filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on July 20, 2018. The plaintiffs sued the Office of Refugee Resettlement (&ldquo;ORR&rdquo;), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (&ldquo;CBP&rdquo;), the Shenandoah Valley Juvenile Center (&ldquo;SVJC&rdquo;), Youth for Tomorrow, and other contractors supporting immigration enforcement under the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (&ldquo;TVPRA&rdquo;), 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1232, and the Administrative Procedure Act (&ldquo;APA&rdquo;), 5 U.S.C. &sect; 551. The plaintiffs also petitioned for writs of habeas corpus. They alleged that the defendants&rsquo; separation of children from their families for extended periods of time violated the TVPRA, the APA, and the Fifth Amendment&rsquo;s Due Process Clause. In their complaint, the plaintiffs also pointed to a <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/uploads/legal-documents/ice-cbp-orr_memorandum_of_agreement.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Memorandum of Agreement</a> (&ldquo;MOA&rdquo;) signed by ORR, CBP, and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on April 13, 2018. In the MOA, ORR agreed to provide CBP and ICE information that it learned about sponsors and their households through the reunification process; the plaintiffs alleged that this information sharing, which was supposedly meant to facilitate better household placement, was really meant to help ICE arrest undocumented people. Represented by the Legal Aid Justice Center, Southern Poverty Law Center, and private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and the immediate release of unlawfully detained children. The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Leonie M. Brinkema.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs raised six claims. The first three claims alleged that the ORR&rsquo;s procedures for family reunification applications violated the TVPRA and the plaintiffs&rsquo; Fifth Amendment rights to substantive and procedural due process. The next two claims related to ORR&rsquo;s policy of requesting biological and biometric information from family members seeking reunification. The plaintiffs alleged that this policy deterred potential sponsors from filing family reunification applications, due to fear of immigration consequences. They also claimed this policy violated the APA for failure to comply with notice-and-comment rulemaking and because it was arbitrary and capricious. The final claim sought habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 2241(c).</p>\r\n<p>The complaint alleged that minor plaintiffs had fled their home countries for fear of persecution or after the death of a family member, and were apprehended by CBP. Two of the four minor plaintiffs were separated from siblings who had fled with them. The other two plaintiffs were placed in ORR custody&ndash;one was sent to Youth for Tomorrow, and the other was transferred to SVJC (a Walmart-turned-detention-center). All plaintiffs were held for six months or more before being reunited with their families.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint and a motion to seal on August 16, 2018. This motion was granted, which means that many of the files related to this case, including the initial complaint, additional complaints, and several motions, are unavailable for public access. The information in this summary comes from those filings that are publicly available.</p>\r\n<p>On September 21, 2018, the defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. The court partially granted this motion two months later, on November 15. Judge Brinkema dismissed as moot the claims of three individual plaintiffs who had, at the time of the motion, been released from ORR&rsquo;s custody. The court also granted the defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss the substantive due process claims. However, the court allowed the APA, TVPRA, and procedural due process claims to proceed. 352 F. Supp. 3d 559.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint on February 22, 2019 and moved for class certification on March 4, 2019. The defendants filed another motion to dismiss the amended complaint for lack of jurisdiction on March 14, 2019, which the court granted five days later. Judge Brinkema dismissed the individual claims of all the plaintiffs as moot because none of the named plaintiffs were still in custody, but the class claims remained.</p>\r\n<p>The court certified two classes on April 26, 2019. First, the court certified a &ldquo;Minor Class&rdquo; of &ldquo;All children designated as unaccompanied [undocumented] minors who (a) were, are being, or will be held in the custody of the ORR anywhere in Virginia at any date on or after July 20, 2018, and (b) have been or will be held in ORR custody for 60 days or more.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Second, the court certified a &ldquo;Sponsor Class&rdquo; of &ldquo;All individuals, anywhere in the United States, who (a) have initiated the process to sponsor a member of the Minor Class (b) as a Category 1 or Category 2 sponsor (c) by either (i) returning a family reunification packet to ORR or to an ORR-contracted caseworker of their desire or willingness to sponsor the Minor Class member (d) to whom the Minor Class member has not been released.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The parties conducted discovery over the following months.</p>\r\n<p>Both the plaintiffs and the defendants filed motions for summary judgment on September 16 and October 16, 2019, respectively. The plaintiffs then moved for a temporary restraining order (&ldquo;TRO&rdquo;) on May 6, 2020. Two days later, the court denied the proposed TRO without prejudice.</p>\r\n<p>On March 17, 2021, the court held both parties&rsquo; motions for summary judgment in abeyance. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security had issued a <a href=\"https://www.aila.org/aila-files/001DBB72-F5E3-49B3-8629-820656C77642/21031235b.pdf?1697590507\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">new memorandum</a> terminating the April 2018 MOA. The new memorandum recognized that the April 2018 MOA&rsquo;s biometric-data-sharing policy &ldquo;undermined the interests of children and had a chilling effect on potential sponsors.&rdquo; Because the April 2018 MOA was central to this case, the court gave the parties time to respond.</p>\r\n<p>Later that year, on June 15, the plaintiffs moved to voluntarily dismiss claims related to the now-terminated April 2018 MOA. This included the entire notice-and-comment claim and parts of the arbitrary and capricious, due process, and TVPRA claims. The court dismissed the claims on June 16, 2021.</p>\r\n<p>On March 25, 2022, the court consolidated the remaining counts into a single issue: did ORR&rsquo;s current reunification policy, &ldquo;insofar as that policy allowed no notice and hearing for discretionary decisions that delay reunification after a child has been in custody for 60 days or more,&rdquo; violate the plaintiffs&rsquo; Fifth Amendment due process rights?</p>\r\n<p>The court heard oral argument on the remaining issue on April 29, 2022. For the reasons stated in open court, Judge Brinkema returned the cross-motions for summary judgment back to the court&rsquo;s active docket.</p>\r\n<p>On August 29, 2023, the court granted summary judgment for the defendants. Judge Brinkema recognized that the minor plaintiffs had constitutionally cognizable interests in family unity and being free from institutional restraints. However, the court held that the Due Process Clause did not require changes to ORR&rsquo;s procedures. The plaintiffs had requested that ORR be required to provide notice and a formal review process for denials of sponsorship applications and after an application has been unresolved for 60 days. The court held that the existing denial notice procedure, which involved notice to the sponsor but not the child, was sufficient, and noted that denials could be based on &ldquo;sensitive&rdquo; grounds like the sponsor&rsquo;s criminal history or unwillingness to take care of the child. Further, the court found that the current review process, by a neutral factfinder, was sufficient. Next, the court held that notice and review after 60 days was unnecessary and perhaps counter-productive, as a formal review process at 60 days could actually prolong the time unaccompanied children were in custody. Therefore, the court held that the current procedure, which involved a review after 90 days, was sufficient. Finally, the court denied the plaintiffs&rsquo; request that ORR include among its reunification assessment criteria &ldquo;the harm to the child&rsquo;s [well-being] of continued federal custody.&rdquo; The court held that this factor might prevent ORR from properly investigating sponsors to make sure children were going to safe homes.

    "summary_short": "In 2018, individual minor plaintiffs from Honduras and Guatemala sued the Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”), U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the directors of two juvenile detention centers. They filed writs of habeas corpus and alleged violations of the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. The claims of individual plaintiffs were dismissed as they were released from custody. However, the court certified two classes of detained minors and sponsors on April 26, 2019. After the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services revised the federal government’s policy for the detention of unaccompanied minors in 2021, the court dismissed all claims except for the Fifth Amendment procedural due process claim. On August 29, 2023, the court granted summary judgment for the defendants, finding that the existing procedures satisfied due process. The case is now closed.",

Ct. at 1538, arguing that their putative class\nclaims change the mootness calculus. To be sure, a defendant cannot nullify a putative class\naction by strategically \"picking off named plaintiffs' claims while a class certification motion is\npending.  Pis.' Opp'n 8 (citing Wilson v. Gordon. 822 F.3d 934, 947-51 (6th Cir. 2016)).\nSimilarly, certain claims by their nature are so \"inherently transitory\" that class claims remain\njusticiable even if the underlying individual claims become moot before the court can rule on\nclass certification. Id at 10 (citing U.S. Parole Comm'n v. Geraghtv. 445 U.S. 388, 399 (1980)).\nCourts in this district have recognized as much,^  R evna v. Hott. No. 1:17-cv-01192, 2018 WL\n3551558, at *3( E.D. Va. Mar. 20, 2018), and defendants offer no objection,  Defs.' Reply 2\nn.l (recognizing \"that the pending class action claims do not automatically become moot because\nthese individuals' claims have become moot\"). But neither doctrine saves individual claims from\nbeing mooted. Here, the three minor plaintiffs who have been released and the three sponsors to\nwhom they have been released received the relief they sought in this litigation; they no longer\npossess the requisite stake to press their individual claims. Accordingly, the Court will grant\ndefendants' motion to dismiss as to individual claims advanced by J.E.C.M., Jimenez Saravia,\nR.A.I., Alvarado, K.T.M., and Velasquez Trail.\n2. Ripeness\nOn the reverse side of the justiciability coin, defendants argue that B.G.S.S.'s and\nJeronimo Sis's claims are not ripe. In defendants' view, the only Article III injury that could\nsustain their challenge to ORR's policies would be an outright denial of Jeronimo Sis's family\n20\n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 60   Filed 11/15/18   Page 21 of 38 PageID# 1160\n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 60   Filed 11/15/18   Page 22 of 38 PageID# 1161\n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 60   Filed 11/15/18   Page 23 of 38 PageID# 1162\n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 60   Filed 11/15/18   Page 24 of 38 PageID# 1163\n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 60   Filed 11/15/18   Page 25 of 38 PageID# 1164\n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 60   Filed 11/15/18   Page 26 of 38 PageID# 1165\n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 60   Filed 11/15/18   Page 27 of 38 PageID# 1166\n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 60   Filed 11/15/18   Page 28 of 38 PageID# 1167\n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 60   Filed 11/15/18   Page 29 of 38 PageID# 1168\n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 60   Filed 11/15/18   Page 30 of 38 PageID# 1169\n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 60   Filed 11/15/18   Page 31 of 38 PageID# 1170\n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 60   Filed 11/15/18   Page 32 of 38 PageID# 1171\n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 60   Filed 11/15/18   Page 33 of 38 PageID# 1172\n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 60   Filed 11/15/18   Page 34 of 38 PageID# 1173\n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 60   Filed 11/15/18   Page 35 of 38 PageID# 1174\n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 60   Filed 11/15/18   Page 36 of 38 PageID# 1175\n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 60   Filed 11/15/18   Page 37 of 38 PageID# 1176\n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 60   Filed 11/15/18   Page 38 of 38 PageID# 1177",

As revealed by a recently leaked memorandum, the Trump administration decided \nto deter illegal immigration by enacting a policy to use detained immigrant children as bait to \narrest immigrants who come forward to sponsor them, even while explicitly acknowledging that \nthis would prolong the detention of immigrant children. To do this, they twisted the sponsorship \nprocess from its Congressionally mandated purpose of ensuring children’s safety while placing \nthem in the least restrictive setting as quickly as possible, introducing steps counterproductive to \nthat goal that were instead designed to facilitate civil immigration enforcement against sponsors. \n2.  Plaintiffs J.E.C.M., B.G.S.S., R.A.I., K.T.M., M.C.L., A.Y.S.R., J.A.T.L., \nC.E.C.P., E.A.R.R., Y.R.R.B., C.M.M. and A.C.M.S. (the “child Plaintiffs”) are among many \ntens of thousands of unaccompanied immigrant children who have made the long and perilous \njourney to the United States surviving trauma and fleeing violence and persecution in their home \ncountries, only to find themselves detained by the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) \nat sites around the country. \n3.  Plaintiffs Jose Jimenez Saravia, Ingrid Sis Sis, Sandra Alvarado, Cinthia \nVelasquez Trial, Reyna Luviano Vargas, Candy Lemus, Kayla Vazquez, Francisco Ramos \nChilel, Astrin Melissa Centeno Irias, Magdalena Miguel and Juan Bautista Maldonado Murillo \n(the “sponsor Plaintiffs”) are individuals who have agreed to open their homes to the child \nPlaintiffs so that they need no longer be detained at government institutions, and now find \nthemselves subject to an arbitrary, standard-free, seemingly endless vetting process that \nfurthermore unnecessarily places them at heightened risk for arrest by federal immigration \nauthorities. \n4.  Plaintiffs Catholic Legal Immigration Network, Inc. (“CLINIC”) and Northwest \nImmigrant Rights Project (“NWIRP”) are organizations that assist immigrant youth and their \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 7 of 81 PageID# 1266\nfamily members in navigating the immigration system in the United States, including the ORR \nsponsorship process.  They now find this work to be much more difficult and costly based on the \nORR policies challenged herein.  \n5.  In recognition of the plight and vulnerability of unaccompanied immigrant \nchildren, Congress enacted laws specifically to protect them, establishing a preference for release \nover lengthy detention and requiring that ORR promptly reunite these children with loved ones \nin the United States, while their immigration cases are adjudicated. As Defendant Lynn Johnson, \nAssistant Secretary for the Administration for Children and Families, U.S. Department of Health \nand Human Services, put it: “The children should be home with their parents. The government \nmakes lousy parents.”2 \n6.  Yet the government’s policies and practices regarding the release of immigrant \nchildren and the reunification of immigrant families do just the opposite. ORR has implemented \nthe sponsorship process in an opaque and arbitrary manner, lacking sufficient notice and \nopportunity to be heard, and designed to stymie—rather than facilitate—the release of detained \nimmigrant children. Family members or other sponsors seeking to open their home to a child in \nORR custody must submit to an opaque process with shifting goalposts; with no delineated \ntimelines whatsoever; which includes procedural steps designed solely to facilitate immigration \nenforcement against the sponsor, to the detriment of the child’s interest in speedy release from \ndetention and in family unity; where the primary decisionmaker, a case manager, has tremendous \nsubjective discretion and unreviewable power to deny a sponsorship application; and which \n                                                 \n2 John Burnett, “Several Thousand Migrant Children In U.S. Custody Could Be Released \nBefore Christmas,” Dec. 18, 2018, National Public Radio, available at \nhttps://www.npr.org/2018/12/18/ 677894942/several-thousand-migrant-children-in-u-s-custody-\ncould-be-released-before-christ.  \n2 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 8 of 81 PageID# 1267\n(unless the sponsor is the child’s parent) results in no written decision and no opportunity for \nappeal.  Meanwhile, the children are trapped in highly restrictive government-controlled \nfacilities, as if they were prisoners serving out criminal sentences without any semblance of due \nprocess. \n7.  To make matters worse, in April 2018, ORR entered into a Memorandum of \nAgreement (MOA) with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), whereby ORR agreed to \nshare with ICE the information it gathered during the family reunification petition process about \nsponsors and others living in the household.  It has become clear that the intended purpose of \nsharing this information was to facilitate DHS’s efforts to arrest and remove undocumented \nimmigrants. The effects of this policy have predictably led to fewer individuals coming forward \nto sponsor children in ORR detention, thus increasing the time that children were detained. The \nMOA also directly increased the length of children’s detention by adding new procedural \nhurdles, again designed to facilitate DHS immigration enforcement against sponsors and others \nin their household. \n8.  As a result of these policies, ORR has held tens of thousands of children across \nthe country in custody for excessive amounts of time and has illegally and improperly denied \nthem the opportunity to reunite with their families. These children deserve the opportunity to live \nin a healthy, nurturing, and healing environment that their sponsors are prepared to provide while \nawaiting adjudication of their immigration claims, and Defendants should not be permitted to \ndelay this reunification any further. \n9.  Given the continued specter of indefinite detention of immigrant children, and \ngiven ORR’s continued facilitation of ICE arrests of sponsors to the detriment of the children in \nits care, Plaintiffs now seek the Court’s intervention so that detained immigrant children will no \n3 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 9 of 81 PageID# 1268\nlonger be subjected to the grievous harms that children suffer when separated from their families. \nDefendants’ actions violate the federal statute that governs the detention and release of \nimmigrant children, the Administrative Procedure Act’s (APA) requirements for promulgating \nrules, the APA’s prohibition on unreasonable delays and arbitrary and capricious agency \nconduct, and the Constitution’s Due Process Clause. Defendants’ actions are causing serious and \nirreparable harm to Plaintiffs and the other potential sponsors and caregivers of released \nunaccompanied children (UACs). Plaintiffs therefore seek declaratory and injunctive relief from \nthis Court to end these violations and harms. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n10.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal \nquestion); 28 U.S.C. § 2201 (Declaratory Judgment Act); 28 U.S.C. § 2241 (habeas corpus); and \n28 U.S.C. § 1361 (mandamus). \n11.  Venue is proper in the Alexandria Division of the Eastern District of Virginia \nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because a substantial part of the events giving rise to these claims \noccurred and continue to occur in this district. Venue is also proper under 28 U.S.C. § 2241(d) \nbecause Plaintiffs J.E.C.M., R.A.I., and K.T.M. were detained within this district at the time the \nComplaint [Dkt. #1] and First and Second Amended Complaints [Dkts. ##4, 21] were filed. \nTHE PARTIES \nPlaintiffs \n12.

Each year, thousands of unaccompanied immigrant children (“UACs”) arrive in \nthe United States to escape persecution and harm in foreign countries. In recent years, the U.S. \nhas seen an influx of children from Mexico and Central America fleeing endemic levels of crime \nand violence that have made those countries extremely dangerous, especially for children and \nyoung adults. \n52.  Government care and custody of UACs is governed by a legal framework \nconsisting primarily of two statutory provisions—§ 279 of Title 6 and § 1232 of Title 8—plus a \nsettlement agreement that is binding on the pertinent federal agencies. In the 1980s and 1990s, \nimmigrant children who arrived in the U.S. were routinely locked up for months in unsafe and \nunsanitary jail cells in remote facilities across the country. These conditions prompted a federal \nlawsuit, Flores v. Reno, which resulted in a 1997 consent decree (the “Flores Agreement”) \nbinding on DHS and ORR, still effective today, that sets national standards for the detention, \nrelease, and treatment of immigrant children in government custody. \n10 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 16 of 81 PageID# 1275\n53.  In addition to setting certain minimal detention standards, Flores guarantees that \nchildren shall be released “without unnecessary delay” while they await their immigration status \nand requires the Government to undertake “prompt and continuous efforts” towards family \nreunification. As the Fourth Circuit explained, “[t]he Flores Agreement spells out a general \npolicy favoring less restrictive placements of alien children (rather than more restrictive ones) \nand their release (rather than detention).” D.B. v. Cardall, 826 F.3d 721, 732 (4th Cir. 2016). \nUnder the Agreement, “[U]nless detention is necessary to ensure a child’s safety or his \nappearance in immigration court, he must be released without unnecessary delay, preferably to a \nparent or legal guardian.” Id. (citing Flores Agreement ¶ 14) (emphasis added) (internal citations \nomitted).  The Flores consent decree also gives these children the right to a bond hearing before \nan immigration judge.3 \n54.  In 2002, Congress took further action to protect this vulnerable population when it \npassed the Homeland Security Act (“HSA”) and transferred the care and custody of \nunaccompanied immigrant children from the Immigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”) to \nthe Office of Refugee Resettlement, housed within the Department of Health and Human \nServices. ORR is not a security agency; its mission is to “incorporate[e] child welfare values” \ninto the care and placement of unaccompanied immigrant children. The Flores Agreement is \nbinding on all successor agencies to the INS, including ORR.4 \n                                                 \n3 The Flores bond hearing does not empower an immigration judge to order a child’s \nrelease from ORR custody or even to review the reunification process. It merely permits the \nimmigration judge to determine whether a child is a danger to the community, thus substantiating \nor contradicting ORR’s claims that it continues to have authority to detain a child. See Flores v. \nSessions, 862 F.3d 863, 867-69 (9th Cir. 2017).  \n4 ORR recognizes its continuing obligations under the Flores Agreement. See Exh. 1 at § \nSec. 3.3 (outlining obligations imposed by Flores Agreement on ORR care provider facilities). \n11 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 17 of 81 PageID# 1276\n55.  Building on Flores and the provisions of the HSA regarding immigrant children, \nCongress further passed the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization \nAct of 2008 (“TVPRA”), codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1232, which grants legal protections to children \nin ORR custody and tasks the agency with ensuring they are “promptly placed in the least \nrestrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child.” Senator Diane Feinstein, a sponsor of \nthe bill that would become the TVPRA, explained that the legislation was intended to redress \nsituations like one she had personally witnessed, where an unaccompanied child remained in \ncustody for nine months after her initial detention. Congress enacted the TVPRA specifically to \nfacilitate the speedy release and minimally restrictive placement of immigrant children. \n56.  As the Fourth Circuit observed, the TVPRA contained various provisions that \nmirror the Flores Agreement’s focus on the welfare of the child. “[T]he Office shall promptly \nplace a UAC in the least restrictive setting that is in the UAC’s best interest, subject to the need \nto ensure the UAC’s safety and timely appearance at immigration hearings.” Cardall, 826 F.3d at \n733 (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(2)(A)). As important, “[t]he Office shall not place a UAC in a \nsecure facility [e.g., NOVA] absent a determination that the UAC poses a danger to self or others \nor has been charged with having committed a criminal offense.” Id.  \nORR’s current reunification policies and practices do not work to promptly release children to \nadequate sponsors, and violate the Due Process rights of children and their sponsors. \n57.  ORR has promulgated but not yet enacted regulations under the TVPRA.5 The \nonly public guidance on ORR’s detention and release procedures is a guide that has existed for at \nleast a decade but was not published online until 2015. See Exh. 1 hereto (ORR Policy Guide). \nORR frequently edits and amends this guide without any explanation or announcement of the \n                                                 \n5 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, “Apprehension, Processing, Care, and Custody of \nAlien Minors and Unaccompanied Alien Children,” 83 Fed. Reg. 45486 (Sept. 7, 2018). \n12 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 18 of 81 PageID# 1277\nchanges. ORR also regularly advises its staff and service providers of nonpublic changes to this \nguide by email or phone. The ORR Policy Guide contains the procedures that control more than \n10,000 children in ORR custody nationwide. \n58.  Reviewing ORR’s placement practices in 2016, a subcommittee of the Senate \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs found that ORR had “failed to \nadopt and maintain a regularized, transparent body of policies and procedures concerning the \nplacement of UACs” and castigated the agency for what it called “[s]etting governmental policy \non the fly” in a manner “inconsistent with the accountability and transparency that should be \nexpected of every administrative agency.”6  \n59.  ORR prioritizes placement with sponsors as follows: Category 1 sponsors are \nparents or legal guardians; Category 2 sponsors are immediate relatives, including brothers, \nsisters, aunts, uncles, grandparents, first cousins, and step-parents; Category 3 sponsors are all \nother adults, including relatives or unrelated adults like family friends. See Exh. 1 (ORR Policy \nGuide) at § 2.2.1.  \n60.  ORR allows itself to deny a child’s release to a parent or legal guardian where \nORR itself determines that “[t]here is substantial evidence that the child would be at risk of harm \nif released to the parent or legal guardian” without requiring termination of parental rights or \neven a petition before a juvenile or family court. Id.  \n                                                 \n6 United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Staff Report, \n“Protecting Unaccompanied Alien Children from Trafficking and Other Abuses: The Role of the \nOffice of Refugee Resettlement,” January 28, 2016, at p.51, available at \nhttps://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Majority%20&%20Minority \n%20Staff%20Report%20-%20Protecting%20Unaccompanied%20Alien%20Children%20from \n%20Trafficking%20and%20Other%20Abuses%202016-01-282.pdf. \n13 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 19 of 81 PageID# 1278\n61.  Under current policy, once a “qualifying” custodian or sponsor has been \nidentified, he or she must complete several forms—including a broad authorization for release of \ninformation and a family reunification application—and provide documentation of the identity of \nthe child, the sponsor’s identity and address, his or her relationship to the child, and “evidence \nverifying the identity of all adults residing with the sponsor and all adult care givers identified in \na sponsor care plan.” Notably, ORR requires potential sponsors to identify all adults in the \nhousehold and an alternative caregiver who is able to provide care in the event the original \nsponsor is unavailable. See Exh. 1. at § 2.2.4. \n62.  If a sponsor is able to provide all the information required by ORR, including \nbiographical and biometric information for the household adults and alternate care givers \nidentified in the sponsor application, an ORR care provider and a nongovernmental third-party \nreviewer, called a “case coordinator,” may “conclude[] that the release is safe and the sponsor \ncan care for the physical and mental well-being of the child;” the care provider then “makes a \nrecommendation for release” to the ORR Federal Field Specialist (FFS), an individual who acts \nas the local ORR liaison with the facility. The FFS then either approves or denies release, or \nrequests more information. See Exh. 1. at § 2.7. \n63.  ORR’s family reunification process is riddled with due process violations. \nGovernment contractors are the primary gatekeepers for a sponsor’s ability to even complete a \nreunification application, before a sponsor receives any official ORR decision. These third party \ncontractors have nearly unfettered power to permit sponsorship applications to go forward, to \ndeny sponsorship as not being viable before the application has been completed (or even begun), \nto require a time-consuming home study of the sponsor, and to forward the application for final \ndecision to supervisors. Exh. 1 at §§ 2.3.3, 2.3.4. In wielding this power, upon information and \n14 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 20 of 81 PageID# 1279\nbelief, they are subjected to pressures from the current administration and directives from ORR \nadministrators that are not necessarily contained in the ORR Policy Guide. At the same time, \nthey are charged with directly assisting sponsors in completing the application in the first place, \nand describe themselves to the sponsors as their advocates. Exh. 1 at § 2.2.3.  \n64.  In the stages prior to an elusive final decision on a sponsor’s application, there is \nlittle or no notice as to why a sponsor may be rejected, what steps remain and what requirements \nwill ultimately complete the reunification application, and no recourse to challenge either \nspecific requirements or a case manager’s subjective determination that a sponsor is not viable. \nIn fact, ORR grants itself discretion to raise additional barriers to sponsorship, prolonging \nchildren’s detention by requiring additional documentation and reunification steps prior to \ncalling the application complete. See Exh. 1 at § 2.2.4 (“ORR may in its discretion require \npotential sponsors to submit additional documentation beyond the minimums specified below”).  \nThese policies prolong children’s time in ORR custody and raise serious due process concerns \nfor those children and for their family members trying to reunify with them. \n65.  When ORR transfers a minor from one detention center to another—which it does \nfrequently, without prior notice or opportunity to be heard, and in its sole discretion—the \nreunification process usually has to start over from the beginning, even without any change in \nsponsor, which adds considerable delays. In addition, even when sponsors have already been \npreviously vetted, they have to go through the entire vetting process all over again from the \nbeginning, which adds considerable delays. If a sponsor temporarily withdraws from the \nsponsorship process, they often have to start the reunification process over from the beginning, \nwhich adds considerable delays.  Indeed, sometimes the mere passage of time during the \n15 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 21 of 81 PageID# 1280\nsponsorship process due to ORR’s delays causes ORR to tell a sponsor that their fingerprints are \n“stale” and must be re-taken and re-processed, adding considerable delays. \n66.  U.S. District Courts for both the Eastern and Western Districts of Virginia have \nadmonished ORR that its reunification process violates the Due Process Clause. See Beltran v. \nCardall, 222 F. Supp. 3d 476 (E.D. Va. 2016) (holding that ORR’s family reunification \nprocedures did not provide the child petitioner or his mother due process of law); Santos v. \nSmith, 260 F. Supp. 3d 598 (W.D. Va. 2017) (holding that ORR’s family reunification \nprocedures caused even more egregious violations of the child petitioner’s and his mother’s due \nprocess rights than had occurred in Beltran).7 Yet ORR has failed to develop sufficient processes \nto protect its child wards or their sponsors’ interests, and instead has made the reunification \nprocess more cumbersome and lengthy. \n67.  Specifically, four of ORR’s written policies, taken together, form an opaque, \nimpenetrable process in which sponsors and children have little sense of what will be required of \nthem to achieve reunification, let alone any way to challenge those requirements or early \nperemptory decisions about sponsor viability. The policies establish an unbridled level of \ndiscretion, allowing front-line government contractors to cut the reunification process short or \n                                                 \n7 Although the sponsors in Beltran and Santos were both the mothers of the petitioners, \nthe liberty interest in family unity is not limited to the nuclear or even biological family. See \nSmith v. Org of Foster Families for Equal. & Reform, 431 U.S. 816, 843 (1977) (“biological \nrelationships are not [the] exclusive determina[nt] of the existence of a family”). Indeed, courts \nhave given great weight to the family unity interests between more distantly related relatives, \nincluding siblings, grandparents, and aunts and sisters. See Moore v. City of East Cleveland, 431 \nU.S. at 496-506 (affirming the constitutional conception of family between a grandmother and \nher grandsons); Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158 (1944) (affirming a constitutionally \nrecognized family relationship between an aunt and her niece); Rivera v. Marcus, 696 F.2d 1016 \n(2d Cir. 1982) (upholding the family unity interests of a half-sister). Likewise, children’s liberty \ninterest in being free from government detention does not depend on their would-be sponsors \nalso being their parents. \n16 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 22 of 81 PageID# 1281\nstop it all together before any official grant or denial of reunification with a sponsor.  \nAdditionally, the case manager must play the role of the prosecutor and judge for each potential \nsponsor, even while telling sponsors they are acting as their advocates. The four ORR written \npolicies, in particular, lack any constitutionally sufficient process and enshrine a process nearly \nidentical to (or worse than) the process that the court in Santos rejected, see Exh. 1:  \n•  Section 2.2.3 of the ORR Guide establishes that the “care provider” or case \nmanager helps the sponsor complete the application and outlines what must be \nsent to the sponsor to complete for a sponsorship application. It establishes the \ncase manager as the gate keeper of the reunification process.  \n•  Section 2.2.4 of the ORR Guide sets forth the required documentation for \npotential sponsors and other adults in the household, while simultaneously \ngranting ORR itself unfettered discretion to require that sponsors provide \nadditional information and take additional steps in the reunification process, \nwithout any indication as to the basis or timing of these additional requirements. \n•  Section 2.4.1 sets out supposed criteria for assessing a sponsor’s viability, to be \nevaluated by the case manager, but does not establish any standards to meet any \nof the criteria or the weight given to each of the criteria. It also establishes highly \nsubjective criteria and improperly places additional burden on would-be sponsors.  \n•  Section 2.4.2 sets out requirements for mandatory home studies, and also grants \nbroad discretion to the government-contracted case manager and case coordinator \nto recommend “discretionary” home studies. Upon information and belief, this \nsection does not include the internal policy of requiring home studies for all \nUACs held in a secure detention center. And although this section suggests that \nthe case managers and case coordinators independently recommend additional \nhome studies, upon information and belief, ORR administrators have begun to \nrequire case managers to recommend home studies in far more cases, with little or \nno justifying concerns about a sponsor’s ability to care for a UAC. Home studies \nsignificantly slow the release process and force potential sponsors to submit to an \ninvasive procedure in which they must open up their homes and their families, \nincluding minor children, to a stranger.  \n68.  Taken together, these policies establish an opaque and overly burdensome \nreunification process, relying on the discretion of government-contracted case managers and \nsubject to manipulation by the whims and directives of ORR administrators before any “official” \nreunification decisions are made. This means that for many would-be and current sponsors, ORR \n17 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 23 of 81 PageID# 1282\ndoes not provide notice as to the reason that their sponsorship was or may be rejected, nor does it \nrequire case managers to divulge the basis for demanding that sponsors meet additional \nrequirements.  Further, the present framework does not provide sponsors with the ability to \nchallenge a case manager’s determination of viability. The current framework deters sponsors \nfrom raising concerns regarding any additional requirements or non-viability decisions with the \ncase manager, because the case manager is also charged with helping the sponsor complete the \napplication, and any challenge to the case manager’s authority or decision-making power may \nresult in retaliation during the process of assessing the viability of the sponsor’s application.  For \ndetained children, this means many more weeks or months in detention, while the case manager \nworks with the sponsor to complete a process with no definitive end and no definitive number of \nsteps or requirements. The process does not accord the children or their sponsors a hearing or \nother meaningful notice or opportunity to be heard, nor is there any procedure establishing such \nan opportunity for them. Contra, e.g., 22 Va. Admin. Code §§ 40-201-10 et seq. (setting out \ndetailed criteria and strict timelines for foster care placements in Virginia).    \n69.  Under the above-mentioned policies, ORR does not sufficiently make the \nsponsors “aware of . . .the evidence or factual findings upon which ORR relied in withholding \n[the child petitioners] from [their sponsors’] care and custody,” which “opaque procedure \ndeprive[s] Petitioner of any opportunity to contest ORR’s findings, and thus any meaningful \nopportunity to alter its conclusions.” Beltran, 222 F. Supp. 3d at 485. \n70.  Both the Beltran and Santos courts found that ORR’s procedures “created a \nsignificant risk that [sponsors and children] would be erroneously deprived of their right to \nfamily integrity” and that additional procedural safeguards of the nature routinely employed \nwhere government interferes with fundamental rights could have mitigated the risk. Beltran, 222 \n18 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 24 of 81 PageID# 1283\nF. Supp. 3d at 488; see also Santos, 260 F. Supp. 3d at 614 (“had better or more process been \ngiven especially as to the delay and the burden being on Ms. Santos to initiate and justify \nreunification, rather than the default rule being otherwise, the outcome could have been \ndifferent”). The likely risk of erroneous deprivation of the most fundamental liberty interests is \nthus significantly higher, and unacceptable, under these circumstances. \n71.  Further, ORR’s actions continue to improperly place the burden onto potential \nsponsors to challenge ORR’s decision and, if unable to obtain relief from ORR, to initiate court \nproceedings. “At no point [is] the onus on ORR to justify its deprivation of Petitioner’s \nfundamental [familial] rights.” Id. Beltran and Santos both concluded that “having determined \nthat it would deprive [mother] and [child] of their fundamental right to family integrity, ORR \ncould not adopt for itself an attitude of ‘if you don’t like it, sue.’” Beltran, 222 F. Supp. 3d at \n485; see also Santos, 260 F. Supp. 3d at 613; see also Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 658 \n(1972) (procedures that “insist[] on presuming rather than proving” are insufficient under the \nDue Process Clause). But that is precisely what ORR policies and practices require plaintiffs to \ndo.  \n72.  In May 2017, likely as a result of the opinion in the Santos case, ORR’s online \npolicy guide was amended to provide for the possibility of an “appeal” to the Assistant Secretary \nof ORR if a reunification request is denied. But this process—at which sponsors have no right to \ncall witnesses, includes no requirement of a reasoned decision, and uses a politically appointed \nofficial as an adjudicator—is available only once a final decision is rendered on a reunification \nrequest. Setting aside the other fatal procedural flaws, this appeal process also fails because, \ngiven current ORR procedures and practices, very few cases will reach ripeness, given the \nindefinite delays that sponsors face during the application process, set forth above. \n19 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 25 of 81 PageID# 1284\n73.  For children, the devastating effect of these delays in release and reunification can \ninclude depression, deterioration in mental health, and behavioral problems associated with \nprolonged detention. Children can feel a sense of hopelessness stemming from their indefinite \ndetention, particularly once they know that the ORR staff members or field professionals with \nwhom they have had contact continually provide positive recommendations on their performance \nand progress, and yet they remain detained in a highly restrictive environment. Discouragement \nbecomes despair, and in some cases, children respond by misbehaving in ways that cause them to \nface progressively more restrictions on their movement in custody, exacerbating their already \nsignificant depression and hopelessness. In other cases, children who fear persecution in their \nhome countries nonetheless opt to accept removal and return there, rather than endure further \ndetention which for all intents and purposes resembles imprisonment in their view. \n74.  Another effect of prolonged detention, and one that is known to ORR, is that \nwhen children detained in ORR’s custody reach their 18th birthday, ORR no longer considers \nthem subject to its detention and custody. 6 U.S.C. § 279(g)(2)(B). The TVPRA provides that \nmost of these children should generally be released upon turning 18.  8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(2)(B).  \nIn fact, however, most of the children are sent to ICE custody instead.  See Ramirez v. U.S. \nImmigration & Customs Enf’t, 310 F. Supp. 3d 7, 30 (D.D.C. 2018).  As one immigration \nattorney described the regular practice at ORR’s current largest detention center nationwide, in \nHomestead, Fla., “When they turn 18, it’s basically, ‘Happy birthday,’ and then they slap on \nhandcuffs and take them off to adult detention centers.”8  \n                                                 \n8 Tim Elfrink, “ICE Handcuffs Immigrant Kids on Their 18th Birthdays, Drags Them to \nJail,” Aug. 23, 2018, Miami New Times, available at \nhttps://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/ice-handcuffs-immigrants-on-18th-birthday-at-\nhomestead-childrens-center-sends-them-to-jail-10651093. \n20 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 26 of 81 PageID# 1285\nORR’s fingerprint-sharing agreement with ICE frustrates its mission of promptly releasing \nchildren to adequate sponsors, was designed for an improper purpose, and is not in the best \ninterests of the children in ORR’s custody. \n75.  Making matters worse, ORR has agreed to allow one aspect of its reunification \nprocess, namely the background vetting of potential sponsors, to be used towards a purpose for \nwhich it was never intended: civil immigration enforcement against the very sponsors who are \nwilling to open their homes to enable children to leave government custody. \n76.  Upon information and belief, ORR has long been aware that the vast majority of \nchildren in its care came to the United States intending to unite or reunite with family members \nwho are also immigrants; that these family members are generally the best sponsors for the \nchildren; and that a disproportionately large number of these family members lack any legal \nstatus in the United States, like the children themselves. \n77.  For many years, ORR has routinely collected fingerprint information of non-\nparent sponsors, in order to run criminal background checks on them.9 ORR did not routinely \nfingerprint sponsors who were the parents of the children they hoped to sponsor unless some \nspecific ‘red flag’ appeared to make it necessary; nor did they routinely fingerprint household \nmembers of sponsors unless some specific ‘red flag’ appeared to make it necessary. Most \nimportantly, any fingerprints that ORR collected were not shared with immigration enforcement \nagencies. \n78.  In late 2017, seeking to reduce the number of immigrants who crossed the \nMexico-United States border, Trump administration immigration policy advisers drafted a \n                                                 \n9 ORR also conducts a number of other background checks on potential sponsors and \ntheir household members using names and other forms of identity verification, that do not \nrequire fingerprints to run. See Exh. 1 (ORR Guide) at § 2.5.1. \n \n21 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 27 of 81 PageID# 1286\nmemorandum containing a number of “Policy Options to Respond to Border Surge of Illegal \nImmigration.”10 The memorandum and the comments thereto set forth a strategy whereby \nimmigrant children and families would be made to suffer, that suffering would be publicized in \nthe media, and this would deter future immigrant families from crossing the border. One of the \npolicy proposals set forth in the memorandum was the now-infamous family separation policy, \nsee Ms. L. v. ICE, 310 F.Supp.3d 1133 (S.D. Cal. 2018). Another policy proposed in the same \nmemorandum as family separation was described as an “MOU with HHS on Requirements for \nReleasing UACs.” The policy proposal as relevant to ORR stated, in full: \n \n79.  The purpose of the proposed MOU with HHS was not child welfare, or better \nvetting of sponsors. Rather, the purpose was to “place [sponsors] into removal proceedings as \nappropriate” in order to “result in a deterrent impact on ‘sponsors’ who may be involved with \nsmuggling children into the United States.” Id. at p.2. The unnamed author of the memorandum \nrecognized that as a direct result of this policy proposal, “sponsors may not take custody of their \n                                                 \n10 Available at https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5688664-Merkleydocs2.html, \nand attached hereto as Exh. 5. \n22 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 28 of 81 PageID# 1287\nchildren in HHS facilities, requiring HHS to keep UACs in custody longer.”  Id.  An unnamed \nreviewer of this memorandum agreed with the author’s recommendation to keep children \ndetained in HHS facilities for longer, commenting, “If [the MOA] could get finalized and \nimplemented soon, it would have a tremendous deterrent effect.”  Id. \n80.  The memorandum attached hereto as Exh. 5 was leaked to Sen. Jeff Merkley by a \nwhistleblower, and was made available to the public on the evening of January 17, 2019.11 \n81.  As proposed in the memorandum, so implemented by Defendants: on April 13, \n2018, ORR signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) \nand Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), agreeing to vastly expand the information \ncollected from sponsors and all of their household members, and to share that information among \nthe agencies. See Exh. 2 (Memorandum of Agreement). The MOA addresses the collection and \nsharing of sponsor, household member, and caregiver information through the sponsorship \napplication process. Id. Hiding its true purpose of deterring immigration and adopting the pretext \nof protecting child welfare, the MOA outlined vastly expanded information collection not just \nfrom potential sponsors, but from every adult household member and a required alternate \ncaregiver. Id. at Sec. 5(B) (“ORR will provide ICE with the name, date of birth, address, \nfingerprints . . . and any available identification documents or biographic information regarding \nthe potential sponsor and all adult members of the potential sponsor’s household”). ORR \nincorporated this information collection and sharing policy into various sections of its ORR \nPolicy Guide.  \n                                                 \n11 See Julia Ainsley, “Trump admin weighed targeting migrant families, speeding up \ndeportation of children,” Jan. 17, 2019, NBC News, available at \nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/trump-admin-weighed-targeting-migrant-\nfamilies-speeding-deportation-children-n958811?fbclid=IwAR3Et5WKKmN3ymF-\nnp_sgWc9bOg6gpkAdLiFu-H4TXxOwLzgfG1xa9o5KpQ. \n23 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 29 of 81 PageID# 1288\n82.  While the publicly stated purpose of this MOA was for ORR to obtain more \ninformation about would-be sponsors and their household members and thereby make better-\ninformed placement decisions, the memorandum attached hereto as Exh. 5 demonstrates that the \nprimary intent and purpose of the MOA was to assist ICE in enforcing immigration laws against \nsponsors and their household members—a purpose that not only has no relationship to ORR’s \nmission, but actually runs contrary to ORR’s statutory obligation to act in the best interests of the \nchildren in its care. (When ICE arrests a would-be sponsor of an immigrant child, that immigrant \nchild obviously cannot be released to the sponsor; when ICE arrests the sponsor of a recently \nreleased immigrant child, that sponsor is prevented from carrying out the terms of his \nsponsorship agreement with ORR, and the child will be plunged into instability and often \npoverty.)12 \n                                                 \n12 For example, one 17-year-old Guatemalan child named E.A.X. came to the United \nStates on July 20, 2018 with his two younger brothers and were detained by Defendants at a 300-\nbed shelter in Arizona. Their father, who lived in Nebraska with his wife and their son, began the \nsponsorship process for his three older boys. After a disciplinary incident, E.A.X. was separated \nfrom his brothers and transferred to a staff-secure facility in northern California. \nOn or around September 4, 2018, E.A.X.’s father submitted his fingerprints to ORR as \npart of the reunification process. Just three days later, E.A.X.’s father got in his car to go to \nwork. A few blocks from his home, he was pulled over by ICE agents, arrested, and quickly \ndeported to Guatemala. After E.A.X. found out that his father had been deported as a result of \nsubmitting fingerprints to sponsor him, E.A.X. felt guilt-ridden and devastated. \nThe brothers’ stepmother continued the sponsorship process in her husband’s place.  \nE.A.X.’s brothers were released to her, but because E.A.X is in a higher security facility than his \nbrothers, he has not been released. As a result of his prolonged detention, the restrictive nature of \nthe staff-secure facility, the separation from his brothers, the release of his brothers, and the \ndeportation of his father, E.A.X.’s behavior became more erratic.  The number of minor \nincidents E.A.X. was involved in increased, further decreasing his chances of release to his step-\nmother. \nFinally, in November of 2018, after E.A.X. had been in detention for four months, he \nlearned that his stepmother was considering withdrawing from the sponsorship process due to the \nburdensome policies challenged in this lawsuit.  E.A.X.’s emotional and psychological condition \n \n24 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 30 of 81 PageID# 1289\n83.  Indeed, in just the first four months of the MOA’s operation, ICE used the MOA \nand the information obtained thereby to carry out civil immigration arrests of 170 sponsors.13 \nThe majority of whom (109) did not have a criminal record.  Of the sixty-one (61) who had a \ncriminal record, most were for charges involving nonviolent and other offenses that would \ngenerally be considered to have no bearing on an individual’s fitness to sponsor a child. Id. \n84.  ORR staff and leadership had previously studied and deliberated the pros and \ncons of putting into place a policy of this nature, but concluded that the marginal increase in \nuseful information would be minimal, and would be vastly outweighed by the predictable \nnegative consequences including a drastic reduction in the number of willing sponsors and a \ncorresponding dramatic increase in the average length of detention of children in ORR custody \nand number of children detained, and therefore concluded that such a policy would not be in the \nbest interests of the children in ORR’s custody.  Upon information and belief, when ORR \ndecided to enter into the ICE fingerprint-sharing MOA in April 2018, ORR did not revisit these \ndeliberations and this conclusion, but instead simply ignored them. \n85.  Consequently, as an entirely predictable result of this ICE fingerprint-sharing \npolicy (indeed, the result that was anticipated and intended by the unnamed drafter of the \nmemorandum attached hereto as Exh. 5), countless would-be sponsors withdrew from the \n                                                 \nfurther deteriorated, and he attempted suicide.  When the paramedics arrived, E.A.X. believed \nthey were there to kill him. He was hospitalized for several days. \nInstead of working to release E.A.X. to a sponsor as quickly as possible, or alternatively \nplace him in a facility where his mental health needs could be adequately met, ORR transferred \nE.A.X. to the Yolo County Detention Facility, its most secure and jail-like detention facility in \nthe United States, where his freedoms are even further curtailed, and he is surrounded by other \nchildren who have similar difficulties adjusting to prolonged detention. \n13 Daniella Silva, “ICE arrested 170 immigrants seeking to sponsor migrant children,” \nDec. 11, 2018, NBC News, available at https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/ice-arrested-170-\nimmigrants-seeking-sponsor-migrant-children-n946621. \n25 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 31 of 81 PageID# 1290\nsponsorship process or declined to step forward to sponsor detained immigrant children, rather \nthan participate in a fingerprint-sharing process that was designed to enable ICE to arrest them.  \nEven more sponsors who were willing to come forward were nonetheless stymied when their \nhousehold members refused to have their fingerprints sent to ICE to be used against them.  In \naddition, the fingerprinting system became overwhelmed with months-long delays added on to \neach release decision as sponsors waited many weeks for a fingerprinting appointment, and then \nwaited many weeks more for the results to come back.  As a result, reunifications ground to a \nnear-halt, and the population of children detained by ORR ballooned from less than 3,000 just a \nyear and a half earlier to nearly 15,000 children, a never-before-seen record.14 More than one-\nthird of those children were detained at mega-facilities with over 1,000 children each, a far cry \nfrom the level of individualized attention implied by the concept of “shelter-level care.” Id.  \n86.  ORR was unable to accommodate all of those children within its existing network \nof shelters, and was forced to erect temporary facilities with much more restrictive conditions.15 \nThe most infamous of these facilities was a fenced-in tent city in the middle of the desert, just \nsteps from the Rio Grande river in Tornillo, Texas, in which children were warehoused in \nconditions reminiscent of the World War II-era Japanese internment camp at Manzanar,16 with \n                                                 \n14 Andres Leighton, “Nearly 15,000 migrant children in federal custody jammed into \ncrowded shelters,” Dec. 19, 2018, Associated Press, available at \nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/19/nearly-15000-migrant-children-in-federal-custody-jammed-\ninto-crowded-shelters.html. \n15 Julián Aguilar, “Operator of migrant facility in Tornillo says it might not stay open past \nJuly 13 when contract expires,” June 25, 2018, The Texas Tribune, available at \nhttps://www.texastribune.org/2018/06/25/operator-migrant-facility-tornillo-says-it-might-not-\nstay-open-past-ju/. \n16 Algernon D’Ammassa, “Tornillo tent city for children could become Trump's \nManzanar,” Oct. 5, 2018, Las Cruces Sun-News, available at https://www.lcsun-\n \n26 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 32 of 81 PageID# 1291\nwoefully insufficient educational or psychological programming available to them.17 The \nsituation of these children was so dire that on December 17, 2018, the operator of the Tornillo \ntent city camp sent a letter to ORR advising that they would no longer accept more detained \nchildren at the facility: “We as an organization finally drew the line,” Defendant Kevin Dinnin, \nthe Executive Director of the organization running the Tornillo detention facility, would later \nexplain. “You can’t keep taking children in and not releasing them.”18  \n87.  Just as predictably, the mandatory fingerprinting and information-sharing of \nsponsors’ household members turned out not to be necessary or even helpful: Defendant Johnson \nwould later state that the policy did not “add[] anything to the protection and safety of the \nchildren.”19 \n88.  The MOA significantly impacted the rights and legal status of thousands of \nchildren in ORR custody, and the potential sponsors, household members, and caregivers of \nthose children. Further, like the ORR Guide, ORR and ICE entered into this MOA and carried \nout its policies and procedures without providing the public and interested parties any notice or \nopportunity to comment on the new rules.  \n                                                 \nnews.com/story/opinion/columnists/2018/10/05/tornillo-tent-city-children-could-become-donald-\ntrump-manzanar-family-case-management-immigration/1518678002/. \n17 Nomaan Merchant, “Beto O’Rourke says immigrant minors not receiving education in \nTornillo facility,” Oct. 3, 2018, Associated Press, available at \nhttps://kfoxtv.com/news/local/beto-orourke-says-immigrant-minors-not-receiving-education-in-\ntornillo-facility. \n18 Emily Green, “Head of controversial tent city says the Trump administration pressured \nhim to detain more young migrants,” Jan. 11, 2019, Vice News, available at \nhttps://news.vice.com/en_us/article/kzvmg3/head-of-controversial-tent-city-says-the-trump-\nadministration-pressured-him-to-detain-more-young-migrants.  \n19 John Burnett, “Several Thousand Migrant Children In U.S. Custody Could Be \nReleased Before Christmas,” Dec. 18, 2018, National Public Radio, available at \nhttps://www.npr.org/2018/12/18/ 677894942/several-thousand-migrant-children-in-u-s-custody-\ncould-be-released-before-christ. \n27 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 33 of 81 PageID# 1292\n89.  The only rationale for collecting immigration status information provided by ORR \nin the ORR Guide is listed in Sec. 2.6 of that guide. See Exh. 1. That section of the guide states, \n“ORR does not disqualify potential sponsors on the basis of their immigration status. ORR does \nseek immigration status information, but this is used to determine if a sponsor care plan will be \nneeded if the sponsor needs to leave the United States; it is not used as a reason to deny a family \nreunification application.” Id. There was no rationale provided regarding seeking or sharing \ninformation about household members’ immigration status, which has no bearing on whether the \nsponsor would need to leave the United States; nor is there any rationale provided regarding \nsharing sponsors’ address information with ICE or otherwise facilitating ICE immigration \nenforcement against sponsors. \n90.  DHS and HHS subsequently published notices in the Federal Register. HHS \nannounced in its notice, however, that the agency had already adopted and implemented these \nchanges to their policies, but nonetheless invited public comment. In a notice published on May \n11, 2018 (“May 11 notice”), ORR “requests the use of emergency processing procedures . . . to \nexpand the scope of . . . information collection” conducted as part of the reunification process. 83 \nFed. Reg. 22490.  In the May 11 notice, ORR states that “the information collection allows ORR \nto obtain biometric and biographical information from sponsors, adult members of their \nhousehold, and adult care givers identified in a sponsor care plan.” Id. Although comment was \nnot due on this notice until July 10, 2018, ORR had clearly begun implementation of the changes \nto the information collection process, stating that “the instruments used in this submission [were] \navailable for use by mid-May 2018,” the same date that the notice was published. Id.  \n91.  DHS also published a notice on May 8, 2018, to update its System of Records to \nimplement the MOA, stating that one purpose of the system is “[t]o screen individuals to verify \n28 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 34 of 81 PageID# 1293\nor ascertain citizenship or immigration status and immigration history, and criminal history to \ninform determinations regarding sponsorship of unaccompanied alien children . . . and to identify \nand arrest those who may be subject to removal.” 83 Fed. Reg. 20846.   \n92.  ORR made vast and drastic changes to the information it collects, and more \nimportantly, the manner in which it uses and shares that information. It did so unilaterally, \nwithout any public input or any apparent thought or consideration to the way these new rules \nwould impact its own mission: to protect these children’s best interest, and promptly reunify \nthem with sponsors in the least restrictive environment possible.  \n93.  Several public groups nonetheless submitted comments to both DHS and HHS \ndenouncing the new “proposed” regulations as contrary to law and to the mission of ORR.20  \nUpon information and belief, based upon internal stakeholder meetings, DHS had no plan or \nintention of providing information to ORR beyond what ORR was already able to obtain on its \nown. The MOA and accompanying procedures were designed purely as an extension of DHS’s \nlaw enforcement authority in order to use children in ORR custody as bait to vastly expand the \n                                                 \n20 See, e.g., Legal Aid Justice Center, Memo Re: HHS ACF Sponsorship Review \nProcedures, available at, https://www.justice4all.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/07/LAJC_Comments-on-OMB-No-0970-0278-Sponsorship-Review-\nProcedures-002.pdf; National Immigrant Justice Center, Memo Re: HHS ACF Notice of \nSponsorship Review Procedures, available at \nhttp://www.immigrantjustice.org/sites/default/files/content-type/commentary-\nitem/documents/2018-\n07/NIJC%20Comment%20on%20HHS%20revisions%20to%20UC%20sponsor%20forms.pdf; \nNational Immigrant Justice Center, Memo Re: DHS Notice of Modified System of Records, \navailable at, https://www.immigrantjustice.org/sites/default/files/content-type/commentary-\nitem/documents/2018-06/NIJC%20Comments%20on%20DHS-2018-\n0013%20System%20of%20Records%20Notice.pdf; American Civil Liberties Union, Memo Re: \nDHS Notice of Modified System of Records, available at \nhttps://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/2018.06.07_aclu_comments_dhs_system\n_of_records_notice_dkt._2018-0013-0001.pdf. \n \n29 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 35 of 81 PageID# 1294\nreach of ICE enforcement.  The result of ORR being unable to identify closely related sponsors \nfor the children in its care, as a result of the sharing of sponsor information with ICE, and any \nsubsequent enforcement action by DHS against a child’s sponsor or the other adults in that \nsponsor’s home, places children at significantly greater risk of being trafficked, smuggled, or \notherwise abused.21 \n94.  ORR’s online guide provides little to no rationale for any given policy change that \nhas occurred over the past year and a half. ORR’s online guide and MOA specifically give only a \ncursory and empty explanation for the new requirements. Upon information and belief, the \nadditional criminal background checks provided for in the Procedures merely duplicate those that \nORR currently performs. See Exh. 1 at § 2.5.1. According to the MOA, ORR will continue to be \nresponsible for criminal history checks on the national, state, and local level. See Exh. 2. \nDuplicative background checks serve only to waste time and resources of two already over-\nburdened agencies. This practice is both arbitrary and capricious, and on information and belief, \nmotivated solely by factors divorced from carrying out the mandate of the statute and case law \ngoverning detention and release of UACs by ORR.  \n95.  In recognition that the policy had been a failure, on December 18, 2018—just one \nday after the head of the Tornillo tent city detention facility advised ORR that he would no \nlonger accept any more child detainees—ORR revised its policy: no longer would sponsors’ \nhousehold members be fingerprinted in all cases. However, the new policy requiring \nfingerprinting of all parent sponsors was not changed; the sharing of sponsors’ fingerprints with \nICE for the explicit purpose of immigration enforcement against them was not changed; and the \nfingerprinting of all household members would still be required in various cases, including any \n                                                 \n21 See generally Human Trafficking Legal Center, Amicus Curiae Brief [Dkt. #45]. \n30 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 36 of 81 PageID# 1295\ncase where a home study was ordered for any reason whatsoever (with no meaningful standards \nlimiting when a home study may be required). See Exh. 1 at §§ 2.5, 2.5.1. These changes were \nexpected to result in the immediate release of a few thousand children, but would leave the \npopulation of detained immigrant children at over 10,000, well more than double what it was \nwhen the MOA first went into effect. \n96.  By means of a memorandum from Defendant Sualog to Defendants Hayes and \nJohnson, ORR recognized that the MOA and the policies set forth therein had not yielded any \nadditional information about potential sponsors that was not otherwise available under the prior \npolicy.  See Exh. 3 (Memorandum from Jallyn Sualog, Dec. 18, 2018) at p.1. ORR also \nrecognized that the MOA and the policies set forth therein were responsible for an increase in the \nmedian length of custody that presented a risk of harm to children. Id. The memorandum \nrecognized that in six months, in not one single case, had the ICE fingerprint-sharing policy \nidentified a new child welfare risk, id. at p.3; but that it was responsible for the median length of \ndetention increasing to 90 days, id. at p.4. ORR considers it best practices to release a child \nwithin 30 days, and recognizes that children may suffer negative child welfare consequences \nafter 60 days. Id. at pp.3-4. \n97.  The December 18 Suallog memorandum therefore recommended that the \nmandatory fingerprinting of sponsors’ household members be terminated, a recommendation that \nDefendant Hayes accepted. Id. at p.4. \n98.  But even though the December 18 Suallog memorandum found that children \nsuffer negative child welfare consequences as a result of prolonged detention in ORR’s care, and \nthat the ICE fingerprint-sharing MOA was resulting in prolonged detention, the December 18 \nSuallog memorandum did not recommend the termination of the MOA or an end to fingerprint \n31 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 37 of 81 PageID# 1296\nsharing with ICE. Id. To the contrary, the memorandum recommended that ORR continue \nfingerprinting all categories of sponsors, and continue sharing those fingerprints with ICE. The \npurported reason for this is to verify the identity of the sponsor. Id. But the memorandum \nundercut this reasoning by allowing ORR staff the discretion to release a child to a sponsor even \nbefore the fingerprint results came back, if ORR was otherwise able to confirm the sponsor’s \nidentity.  Id. In other words, ORR would continue to send all sponsors’ fingerprints to ICE, \nplacing them at risk of ICE arrest, even where other records or forms of identification were \nsufficient to accomplish the only remaining justification for the fingerprint-sharing, namely \nverifying the identity of the sponsors. \n99.  The December 18 Suallog memorandum states, “The ORR field staff[] has \ninformed me that biometric ICE background checks of all categories of sponsors are helpful for \nsuitability analyses because they confirm the sponsor’s identify.” Id. at p.3. But the \nmemorandum then proceeds to entirely undercut this justification by allowing ORR to release a \nchild to a Category 1 or 2 sponsor before the biometric ICE background check even comes back, \nwhere the sponsor can otherwise confirm their identity. Furthermore, the memorandum makes no \neffort to balance or weigh the purported benefit of further confirmation of the sponsor’s identity \nagainst the real and demonstrated harm to children caused by prolonged detention as detailed in \nthe same memorandum.  See also Exh. 4 (ORR Frequently Asked Questions guide) (listing only \ntwo reasons for the continuation of the ICE fingerprint sharing policy: identity verification of \nsponsors, and determining the immigration status of sponsors to determine whether a backup \ncare plan might be required should the primary sponsor leave the United States).   \n32 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 38 of 81 PageID# 1297\nFACTS PERTAINING TO PLAINTIFFS \nJ.E.C.M. and his sponsor Jose Jimenez Saravia \n100.  J.E.C.M. is a 14-year-old citizen of Honduras who came to the U.S. in February \n2018 accompanied by a friend. He fled Honduras to escape persecution, including threats to his \nown life.  \n101.  J.E.C.M. has known and been close with his brother-in-law Jose Jimenez Saravia \nsince he was a toddler. He spoke with his sister and brother-in-law by phone on a regular basis \nwhen he was living in Honduras, every week or every other week. They often sent money to \nsupport him in Honduras so that he could attend school.    \n102.  J.E.C.M. has never been arrested for or charged with a crime. Prior to coming to \nthe United States at the age of 13, he went to school and mostly stayed in his home with his \nfamily out of fear of violence.  \n103.  J.E.C.M. fled Honduras in at the end of December 2017. J.E.C.M. arrived in the \nU.S. at the end of February 2018, and was apprehended by Customs and Border Patrol. He was \nplaced in an unaccompanied children’s shelter in San Diego, California operated by Southwest \nKey Programs. \n104.  On March 9, 2018, J.E.C.M. was transferred to Selma Carson Home in Fife, \nWashington, a staff secure facility near Tacoma. He was transferred to the staff secure facility \nbecause he had been labeled as an escape risk by his clinician based on his confiding in his \nclinician that he did not want to be in the shelter and wanted to be with his family instead.   \n105.  J.E.C.M.’s case manager prepared an ORR Release Notification on April 5, 2018 \nstating “ORR has determined that the below Juvenile Respondent should be released to a \nsponsor,” and listed J.E.C.M.’s brother-in-law, Mr. Jimenez Saravia, as the custodian. However, \nJ.E.C.M. was not released to Mr. Jimenez Saravia. Instead, J.E.C.M. remained in ORR custody \n33 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 39 of 81 PageID# 1298\nat Selma Carson Home until about April 19, 2018, when he was transferred to secure detention at \nthe Northern Virginia Juvenile Detention Center (“NOVA”) in Alexandria, Virginia. \n106.  J.E.C.M. was officially transferred to NOVA on April 19, 2018 and remained \nthere until July 26, 2018, a week after this action was initially filed with this court. For the last \nthree months of his detention, he was detained in this high security facility (i.e., most restrictive) \nin Northern Virginia. The conditions of the high security NOVA facility severely limited \nJ.E.C.M.’s movement within the facility, and his time to socially interact, play, and learn with his \npeers or on his own. And given that J.E.C.M. was placed with other, older children who had been \ndeemed at-risk, all of these factors would be expected to mentally break down any individual, let \nalone a 13-year-old boy who had already suffered greatly. \n107.  J.E.C.M.’s mental health deteriorated while at NOVA. He was the youngest \nresident and was the target of constant bullying. He did not feel that he could trust the other \nresidents, and was afraid to report bullying to staff for fear of retaliation. He had significant \ndifficulty coping with the conditions at NOVA, which he calls a jail. He felt he would never get \nused to being held in a jail. He wanted only to be with his family, and did not understand why he \nwas still being held by ORR.  \n108.  Upon information and belief, despite ORR staff recommendations that J.E.C.M. \nbe reunified with Mr. Jimenez Saravia, ORR began requiring Mr. Jimenez Saravia’s partner, \nJ.E.C.M.’s sister, and other adult members of the household to submit biographical and biometric \ninformation as a pre-condition to J.E.C.M.’s release. The adults in Mr. Jimenez Saravia’s \nhousehold feared, correctly, that this information would be used for immigration enforcement \npurposes. As is common practice, Mr. Jimenez Saravia never received written notice that he had \nbeen denied as a sponsor or that he was not a viable sponsor without his household member’s \n34 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 40 of 81 PageID# 1299\nfingerprints. Nonetheless, J.E.C.M. remained locked in a juvenile jail only because of a change \nin ORR policy and the MOA.  \n109.  J.E.C.M.’s prolonged imprisonment at a very young age, and his inability to be \nwith his family caused him significant anxiety and sadness. He often cried when speaking to \nfamily members on the phone and struggled to cope with the daily bullying he experienced at \nNOVA. J.E.C.M. sought to leave this environment where he felt depressed, sad, and alone, and \nto be placed with his brother-in-law and family who he knew would provide him the care and \nattention he needed. \n110.  J.E.C.M. was released to Mr. Jimenez Saravia on or about July 26, 2018, just days \nafter the filing of the First Amended Complaint [Dkt. #4] and first Motion for Class Certification \n[Dkt. #5] in this action. He remains living with Mr. Jimenez Saravia subject to ORR’s \nsponsorship agreement and may be re-detained and placed in ORR custody again in the future.  \nB.G.S.S. and his sponsor, Ingrid Sis Sis \n111.  B.G.S.S. is a 17-year-old citizen of Guatemala who came to the U.S. in May \n2018. He fled Guatemala to escape persecution and because his mother had passed away. \n112.  Ingrid Sis Sis is B.G.S.S.’s niece, although she is older than him.  The two have \nknown each other since B.G.S.S. was a child and Ms. Sis Sis was a young adult.  They would \noften spend time together at B.G.S.S.’s great-grandmother’s house in Guatemala. After Ms. Sis \nSis came to the United States and B.G.S.S. stayed in his grandmother’s care in Guatemala, Ms. \nSis Sis would call B.G.S.S.’s grandmother regularly and ask about his wellbeing and schooling, \nand often speak to him directly. Ms. Sis Sis also has stayed in regular communication with \nB.G.S.S. through text messages. \n113.  B.G.S.S. has never been arrested for or charged with a crime. Prior to coming to \nthe United States, he went to school, worked, and mostly stayed in his home with his family.  \n35 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 41 of 81 PageID# 1300\n114.  B.G.S.S. was initially placed in a small BCFS-operated ORR shelter in \nRaymondville, Texas which houses approximately 50 children. B.G.S.S. did well in the small \nprogram, getting along with the other children and adjusting well as the staff worked on family \nreunification. But after approximately 10 days at BCFS Raymondville, B.G.S.S. was transferred \nto Casa Padre due to “emergency influx.” Unlike BCFS Raymondville, Casa Padre was a \nwarehouse of about 1,500 children, housed in a converted Walmart.22 Despite the number of \nchildren, there were only 313 “door-less rooms” for children to sleep in.23 The facility was noisy, \nand the rooms were merely walls that do not reach all the way to the ceiling, creating a \ncacophonous echo chamber of 1,500 children day and night.24 Casa Padre had a poor reputation \n                                                 \n22 Dan Barry et al., “Cleaning Toilets, Following Rules: A Migrant Child’s Days in \nDetention” July 14, 2018, The New York Times, available at \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/14/us/migrant-children-shelters.html; see also Michael \nMiller, Emma Brown and Aaron C.

Children were highly monitored and controlled, and have reported that \nstaff have been at best unkind and at worst abusive.25 Despite being ordered by a judge to permit \nan Ad Litem investigator to inspect the facility and interview the children there, ORR refused \naccess and delayed inspection by removing the matter to federal court.26  \n115.  After being transferred to Casa Padre, B.G.S.S. became depressed, irritable, and \nhopeless. He was overwhelmed by the sheer number of children and people around him all the \ntime. He could not sleep at night because of the noise, and shared a room with four other \nchildren. Unlike at BCFS Raymondville, each child only had 8 minutes to shower each day, and \nstaff zealously wrote behavior reports about children for even the smallest transgression. With so \nmany children together, it was inevitable that they would not all get along, so bullying and \ndisagreements with other children were common. \n116.  Under the constant stress of being in the Casa Padre environment, B.G.S.S.’s \nmental and behavioral health deteriorated. He received several significant incident reports (SIRs) \nfor things ORR staff alleged he said either to them or to other residents, or for not following \n                                                 \n25 See Mary Tuma, “Allegations of Mistreatment at Southwest Key Shelter: The \ndeportation complex,” The Austin Chronicle, August 3, 2018, available at \nhttps://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2018-08-03/allegations-of-mistreatment-at-a-southwest-\nkey-shelter/; see also Alan Pyke, “‘This is it for you.

He never received an SIR for \nany violent behavior.  \n117.  One conversation with ORR staff in which B.G.S.S. made inappropriate but false \nclaims about his age and about past and future violence ultimately resulted in his being \ntransferred directly to a secure facility.  \n118.  Prior to his arrival at SVJC, B.G.S.S. was never advised that his conversations \nwith staff would be reported to ORR or could be used against him to place him in more \nrestrictive settings. Despite his clinician, case manager, and other staff asking him about his past, \nhis behaviors, and his statements in order to convey that information to ORR for use in making \nplacement decisions, he was not advised of the impact his statements could have on his \nplacement, his reunification, or potentially his immigration case.  \n119.  Following the incident in which ORR alleges that B.G.S.S. made criminal self-\ndisclosures, B.G.S.S. has consistently denied being an adult or having committed violence in the \npast. His birth certificate has been verified by the Guatemalan embassy and by his family in \nGuatemala and in the United States. B.G.S.S. and all of his family not only denied that B.G.S.S. \nhad ever committed violence in his home country but also offered plausible, age-appropriate \nexplanations for his admittedly misguided but certainly not criminal false reports regarding his \nage and past. B.G.S.S. has also consistently denied having any plan to commit violence in the \nfuture. Nonetheless, despite investigating the veracity of B.G.S.S.’s “self-disclosures” pursuant \nto ORR Policy 1.4.2, and finding no credible support for any of them, ORR staff recommended \nthat B.G.S.S. be placed in a staff secure facility following these uncorroborated “admissions.”  \n120.  B.G.S.S.’s case manager recommended that he be transferred to a staff secure, or \nmedium-level security program. Instead, and without explanation, B.G.S.S. was sent directly to \n38 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 44 of 81 PageID# 1303\nthe most secure program available at SVJC, which serves both as an ORR facility and as a \njuvenile jail for minors in Virginia who have been adjudicated delinquent in state court.  \nB.G.S.S. was detained at SVJC in the custody of ORR on August 16, 2018, when he joined this \naction and filed a habeas corpus petition by means of the Second Amended Complaint [Dkt. \n#21]. \n121.  Thereafter, ORR transferred him to other secure and staff-secure facilities.  He \nremains detained by ORR in San Antonio, Texas as of the date of filing this pleading. \n122.  B.G.S.S.’s sister, Blanca Jeronimo Sis, who resides and works in Virginia, first \nsought to sponsor B.G.S.S. and take custody of him. Ms. Jeronimo Sis formally applied with \nORR to be B.G.S.S.’s sponsor and submitted her biographical and biometric information. On \nJune 20, 2018, while at Casa Padre, ORR staff completed a release request for B.G.S.S.’s release \nto his sponsor. But after B.G.S.S. was transferred to SVJC, ORR added onerous steps to his \nreunification process, pursuant to the policies and practices described above, and told Ms. \nJeronimo Sis over the phone that her sponsorship of B.G.S.S. would likely not be approved, or if \nit was approved would take a long time.  Ms. Jeronimo Sis then gave up on the idea of being able \nto sponsor B.G.S.S. \n123.  On or about January 3, 2019, B.G.S.S.’s 27-year-old niece Ingrid Sis Sis, also a \nresident of Virginia, was given a sponsorship package, which she submitted to the caseworker \njust one day later in an effort to sponsor B.G.S.S. and finally bring him home to live with family, \ninstead of in an institution.  Some days thereafter, she was given another five pages to fill out, \nwhich she submitted within about a week.  She submitted her fingerprints on January 15, 2019.  \nNotwithstanding having quickly complied with every request by the caseworker, Ms. Sis Sis has \n39 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 45 of 81 PageID# 1304\nnot been told the current status of her sponsorship application, nor has she been given a timeline \nfor when she can expect B.G.S.S. to be released to her care. \n124.  B.G.S.S.’s prolonged imprisonment at a young age, and his inability to be with his \nfamily has caused him significant anxiety and sadness. B.G.S.S. seeks to leave this environment \nwhere he feels depressed, sad, and alone, and to be placed with his family who will provide him \nthe care and attention he needs. \nR.A.I. and her sponsor Sandra Alvarado \n125.  R.A.I. is a 15-year-old girl from Honduras. At the age of five, she left her parents’ \nhouse and went to live with her sister, Sandra Alvarado, because her parents could no longer care \nfor her or support her.  \n126.  R.A.I. came with her sister to the United States in April 2018. They came because \nthere was significant violence in their community and to enable R.A.I. to study. Ms. Alvarado \nwanted a better future for her young sister.  \n127.  Despite Ms. Alvarado being R.A.I.’s primary caretaker, the two were separated at \nthe border by U.S. immigration officials. R.A.I. was placed in ORR custody in Virginia at Youth \nfor Tomorrow (“YFT”). Ms. Alvarado was paroled to Maryland where she lived in an apartment \nwith a friend. \n128.  Ms. Alvarado was initially told that she could not sponsor her younger sister \nR.A.I., whom she had raised, because the adult roommates living in her apartment refused to \nsend any biographical or biometric information to ORR. As is common practice, Ms. Alvarado \nnever received written notice that she had been denied as a sponsor or that she was not a viable \nsponsor without her household member’s fingerprints. Ms. Alvarado had to move out of her \napartment and into a different home with her siblings, who were willing to provide their \nbiographical and biometric information for the sponsorship application. Only after moving in \n40 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 46 of 81 PageID# 1305\nwith her siblings and communicating their willingness to participate in the reunification process \nwas she able to officially begin the sponsorship process.  \n129.  R.A.I. was detained at YFT in the custody of ORR on August 16, 2018, when she \njoined this action and filed a habeas corpus petition by means of the Second Amended Complaint \n[Dkt. #21].  ORR released R.A.I. into the custody of her sister Ms. Alvarado only after the filing \nof the Second Amended Complaint [Dkt. #21] and Supplemental Motion for Class Certification \n[Dkt. #28] identifying her as a Plaintiff and putative class representative in this action. She \nremains living with Ms. Alvarado subject to ORR’s sponsorship agreement and may be re-\ndetained and placed in ORR custody again in the future. \nK.T.M. and his sponsor Cinthia Velasquez Trail \n130.  K.T.M. is a 15-year-old boy from Honduras. He fled Honduras with his older \nsister, Wendy, to escape violent and credible threats on his life after his father was murdered in \nfront of him. He has experienced severe trauma and has relied on his older siblings to care for \nhim and help him cope with the violence to which he has been exposed. He and his other sister \nCinthia Velasquez Trail have always had an especially close relationship: after Ms. Velasquez \nTrail moved to the United States a few years ago, K.T.M. spoke with her every day by phone. He \nalso spoke to her husband several times a week by phone. He has a close and loving relationship \nwith both his older sisters and with his brother-in-law.  \n131.  K.T.M. and his sister Wendy arrived in the U.S. in March 2018. Although Wendy \nwas caring for K.T.M., they were separated at the border by U.S. immigration officers, despite \nK.T.M.’s desire to remain with his sister. K.T.M. was placed in ORR custody in Virginia at YFT. \nHis sister Wendy was paroled to Texas where she is living with their sister, Cynthia Velasquez \nTrail.   \n41 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 47 of 81 PageID# 1306\n132.  K.T.M.’s sister, Ms. Velasquez Trail, submitted all the requisite paperwork to be \nK.T.M.’s sponsor. She lives with her partner and with K.T.M.’s other sister, Wendy, with whom \nK.T.M. traveled to the U.S. Although K.T.M.’s sister and brother-in-law both submitted all the \nrequired documentation and passed their background checks, upon information and belief, \nWendy was unable to be scheduled for her background check and fingerprint appointment \nbecause ICE had confiscated her identification upon apprehension and she did not have another \nform of valid photo ID. As is common practice, Ms. Velasquez Trail never received written \nnotice that she had been denied as a sponsor or that she was not a viable sponsor without her \nhousehold member’s fingerprints. \n133.   K.T.M. was detained at YFT in the custody of ORR on August 16, 2018, when \nhe joined this action and filed a habeas corpus petition by means of the Second Amended \nComplaint [Dkt. #21].  ORR released K.T.M. into the custody of his sister Ms. Velasquez Trail \nonly after the filing of the Second Amended Complaint [Dkt. #21] and Supplemental Motion for \nClass Certification [Dkt. #28] identifying him as a Plaintiff and putative class representative in \nthis action. He remains living with Ms. Velasquez Trail subject to ORR’s sponsorship agreement \nand may be re-detained and placed in ORR custody again in the future. \nM.C.L. and her sponsor, Reyna Luviano Vargas \n134.  Plaintiff M.C.L., 14 years old, fled Mexico last fall. She was forced to leave her \nhome after a series of events involving the same group of violent men. They killed three of her \nuncles, broke into her family’s home, and threatened her at gunpoint.    \n135.  When she entered the United States on November 6, 2018, M.C.L. was taken to a \njail-like holding facility in San Diego, California.   \n136.  M.C.L.’s mother, Reyna Luviano Vargas, lives about 150 miles from San Diego \nin San Fernando, California. Her husband and their daughters, ages 9 and 11, live with her. \n42 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 48 of 81 PageID# 1307\n137.  Four days after M.C.L.’s arrival, ORR transferred her to an emergency shelter \nacross the country in Homestead, Florida. The federal government is currently expanding that \nfacility to hold up to hold as many as 2,350 children at a time.27 Homestead, like the above-\ndescribed Tornillo tent city that ORR recently closed, is not subject to state licensure and \ncorresponding child welfare inspections.28 \n138.  Within a week of M.C.L.’s arrival, Ms. Luviano Vargas had submitted her \ndaughter’s sponsorship application to ORR. In it, she disclosed a 2015 insurance fraud offense \nfor which she had served a few months in jail and completed probation. \n139.  Ms. Luviano Vargas and her daughter talk by phone twice a week for 10 minutes \nat a time. Ms. Luviano Vargas hears fear in M.C.L.’s voice, and M.C.L. tells her that she can’t be \ncompletely honest with her because case workers can overhear her conversations. \n140.  M.C.L. has asthma and took medication for it in Mexico. Ms. Luviano Vargas has \nreason to think she is not receiving appropriate medical attention in the Homestead facility, \nbased on her daughter’s comments to her. Because of this, Ms. Luviano Vargas is consumed with \nworry. \n141.  Case workers have told M.C.L. that the reason she has been detained so long is \nbecause her mother committed a crime, and that she may have to go up for adoption due to that. \n                                                 \n27 Andres Leighton, “The Rise and Fall of the Tornillo Tent City for Migrant Children,” \nJan. 9, 2019, Associated Press, available at https://www.texasmonthly.com/news/migrant-\nchildren-tornillo-tent-city-released/. \n28 Graham Kates, “Some detention centers for migrant children not subject to state \ninspections,” July 5, 2018, CBS News, available at https://www.cbsnews.com/news/some-\ndetention-centers-for-immigrant-children-wont-be-subject-to-traditional-inspections/. \n43 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 49 of 81 PageID# 1308\n142.  A supervisor reprimanded Ms. Luviano Vargas when she asked how long she \ncould expect to wait. He told her the wait would be five to seven months, and that the long wait \nwas her fault because she had committed a crime. \n143.  On January 9, 2019, Ms. Luviano Vargas was promised reunification by the case \nmanager, who said she had gotten the results of the fingerprint check and would submit the \nrelease application that day. \n144.  Five days later, reunification had not occurred, so Ms. Luviano Vargas called the \ncase manager. The case manager said she was still waiting for fingerprint results, and did not \nacknowledge her promise of January 9, 2019. \n145.  M.C.L. is desperate to leave the Homestead facility and join her mother, \nstepfather, and half-sisters in California.  Ms. Luviano Vargas feels betrayed and distressed by \nthe shifting representations as to when her child will come home. \nA.Y.S.R. \n146.  Plaintiff A.Y.S.R., 17, left her hometown in El Salvador about four months ago \nwith her one-year-old son, K.E.G.S.  The violence in A.Y.S.R.’s life had reached a breaking \npoint. From age 7 to 14, she was sexually abused by her father, a high-ranking member of a \nSalvadoran gang. At 14, she told her mother, who refused to believe her. Her mother died a few \nmonths later, and A.Y.S.R. was forced to keep living with her father. About three years ago, as \nher father was making plans to leave the country with her, she ran away from home.  \n147.  A.Y.S.R. fell in love with a boy from her town who was one year older than her. \nAlmost two years ago, A.Y.S.R. gave birth to their son, who suffers from convulsions.  \n148.  They lived in relative peace despite the gang violence in their community until \nA.Y.S.R.’s father returned, looking for her. Members of a rival gang learned he was there and \npressured A.Y.S.R. to deliver him to them. She did not want to be responsible for the death of \n44 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 50 of 81 PageID# 1309\nher father, but she feared the rival gang would hurt her and her baby for refusing. So she fled, \nheading north for the United States. \n149.  A.Y.S.R. did not have many close relatives in her life whom she could trust. \nThankfully, she had grown to love and trust Myrna, the wife of her father’s cousin. Though \nMyrna lived in Colorado with her daughter, she visited A.Y.S.R. often and kept in regular \ncontact by phone. A.Y.S.R. would not hesitate to ask Myrna for help with things for K.E.G.S.  \nA.Y.S.R. knew that if she made it to the United States, she wanted to live with Myrna. \n150.  A.Y.S.R. and her son presented at a port of entry in Arizona on September 21, \n2018. U.S. immigration officials tried to separate them, but A.Y.S.R. resisted. They spent four \ndays in a Border Patrol holding facility commonly known as an “icebox” for its freezing \ntemperatures and lack of adequate facilities for the care of children, and then were transferred to \nCrittenton, a youth detention center in California.  \n151.  Myrna and her husband submitted sponsorship materials to ORR and were \nfingerprinted more than two months ago. They are still waiting for the results of the fingerprints. \nAn official in Denver told Myrna the delay was due to the high number of people in detention. \n152.  As part of the sponsorship application process, Myrna and her husband also \nunderwent a home study, where their lives were extensively probed and they felt their home and \noffer to help were criticized.  \n153.  For the first several weeks she was detained, A.Y.S.R. was not able to talk to any \nloved ones outside Crittenton. Myrna had to tell the social worker that A.Y.S.R. had the right to \nphone calls with her. Since then, A.Y.S.R. and Myrna talk twice a week, 20 minutes at a time. \nA.Y.S.R. is not allowed to talk to her baby’s father, her partner. \n45 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 51 of 81 PageID# 1310\n154.  A.Y.S.R. is depressed. She feels trapped and unwanted at Crittenton. She has \ntrouble sleeping for the first time in her life, and when she wants to be alone she is not allowed to \nbe. Staff took away tools A.Y.S.R. could use to hurt herself. A.Y.S.R. has been through serious \ntrauma, and has been deprived of access to her support system – her partner and Myrna.  \n155.  A.Y.S.R. did not know when she left home for the United States that she and \nK.E.G.S. would be held against their will for four months. It has been extremely hard for \nA.Y.S.R. to adjust to life in Crittenton despite her best efforts.  \n156.  A.Y.S.R. turns 18 in less than three months. \nJ.A.T.L. and his sponsor, Candy Lemus \n157.  J.A.T.L. is an eleven-year-old boy from Honduras.    \n158.  J.A.T.L. entered the United States on or around August 25, 2018, near Hidalgo, \nTexas with an uncle. At the border, J.A.T.L. was separated from his uncle and sent to the Board \nof Child Care shelter in Baltimore, Maryland, where he was admitted on or around August 27, \n2018. Several weeks later, J.A.T.L. was told that his uncle had been deported, which upset him.  \n159.  In the shelter, J.A.T.L. has experienced nightmares. He has been sick on at least \none occasion.  \n160.  J.A.T.L. has received individual counseling in the shelter to help him manage his \nanger and build coping skills. On one occasion, he hid under his counselor’s desk at the end of \nhis counseling session and refused to leave.  \n161.  Staff members have reported that J.A.T.L. shows irritability and distress when he \nprays.  \n162.  A psychiatric evaluation of J.A.T.L. states that J.A.T.L. feels “anxious, \nfrightened, and alone” and concludes that his “attention seeking behaviors, clinginess, and his \n46 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 52 of 81 PageID# 1311\nfighting with other boys are likely caused by stress.” It recommends that he “[r]eunify with \nfamily as soon as possible.”  \n163.  Candy Lemus, J.A.T.L.’s aunt, is seeking to sponsor J.A.T.L. She resides in South \nCarolina with her partner and her 4-year-old daughter.  \n164.  Ms. Lemus submitted the sponsorship documentation to ORR in October and \nNovember 2018. In or around November, she submitted her biometric information. About \nseveral weeks later, her partner submitted his biometric information.  \n165.  In November or December 2018, ORR performed a home visit at Ms. Lemus’ \nresidence.  \n166.  J.A.T.L.’s mother, Ms. Lemus’ sister, also resides in South Carolina. J.A.T.L.’s \nmother originally sought to sponsor him, but her husband was reluctant to submit his biometric \ninformation to ORR out of a well-founded concern that it would be shared with immigration \nenforcement officials.  \n167.  A case manager named Iliana initially helped Ms. Lemus fill out the sponsorship \npaperwork. Since Ms. Lemus submitted the sponsorship packet, various other case managers \nhave contacted her about J.A.T.L.’s case, causing delays because when she had questions about \nher sponsorship application, she did not know whom to contact. She tried calling Iliana and left \nher a voice message, but Iliana did not respond.  \n168.  In or around December 2018, a case manager called Ms. Lemus to inform her that \nthey did not receive some paperwork. Ms. Lemus believes the case manager was referring to \npaperwork from the home visit that Ms. Lemus had previously submitted. Ms. Lemus \nsubsequently re-sent the home visit paper work to ORR.   \n47 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 53 of 81 PageID# 1312\n169.  Around this same time, another case manager contacted Ms. Lemus. She told her \nthat they were still waiting on paperwork from J.A.T.L.’s mother granting custody to Ms. Lemus.  \n170.  A case manager recently told Ms. Lemus that they are still missing two \ndocuments as well as the custody paperwork from J.A.T.L.’s mother.  \n171.  Around Christmas 2018, Ms. Lemus drove from South Carolina to Maryland in \nhopes of visiting J.A.T.L. Unfortunately, she was not allowed to visit him because the shelter had \nnot yet received a response about whether Ms. Lemus’ biometric information had been cleared.    \n172.  Before she left Honduras around December 2016, Ms. Lemus helped raise \nJ.A.T.L. When J.A.T.L. was younger, his mother moved to another town in Honduras for work. \nJ.A.T.L. stayed with Ms. Lemus, Ms. Lemus’ mother, and other family members. Ms. Lemus \nhad primary responsibility for J.A.T.L. when his mother was absent. J.A.T.L.’s mother came to \nthe United States in 2015 or 2016.  \n173.  Ms. Lemus speaks with J.A.T.L. about once a week, usually on Tuesdays. A case \nmanager calls Ms. Lemus and hands the phone to J.A.T.L. J.A.T.L. generally tells Ms. Lemus \nthat he is OK and that the shelter is taking care of him and feeding him. But Ms. Lemus can hear \nin J.A.T.L.’s voice that he wants to be reunited with his family. Ms. Lemus tries to reassure him \nthat they will be together soon, but she cannot tell him when that will be.  \nC.E.C.P. and his sponsor, Kayla Vazquez \n174.  Plaintiff C.E.C.P. is a 17-year-old boy from Honduras. He turns 18 in four \nmonths.  \n175.  From birth until he was about age 5, C.E.C.P. lived with his parents, his aunt, and \nhis cousin Carlos. Carlos treated C.E.C.P. more like a brother, and C.E.C.P. grew to see him that \nway.  \n48 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 54 of 81 PageID# 1313\n176.  Carlos migrated to the United States in 2006, but he remained close to his \nrelatives in Honduras, including C.E.C.P. In 2012, when Carlos met his future wife, he began to \ninclude her in his weekly calls with family.  \n177.  Carlos’ wife is Plaintiff Kayla Vazquez. By the time they married in 2015, Ms. \nVazquez had built a relationship of her own with C.E.C.P and had come to love him.  \n178.  Early in 2018, Ms. Vazquez learned that C.E.C.P.’s father was physically abusing \nhim.  C.E.C.P. told Ms. Vazquez that he was desperate to escape the beatings and abuse at home.    \n179.  C.E.C.P. left home and headed north around June 2018. On August 22, 2018, Ms. \nVazquez learned that C.E.C.P. had been taken into U.S. government custody along the border. \nC.E.C.P. remains confined at BCFS International Children's Shelter in Harlingen, Texas. \n180.   Ms. Vazquez, who is a native-born U.S. citizen, volunteered to sponsor C.E.C.P. \nInitially, she thought her citizenship status would facilitate a faster reunification. She submitted \nall the required information, including certified copies of C.E.C.P.’s passport and birth \ncertificate. She and Carlos were fingerprinted, and in December 2018, they submitted to a home \nvisit. At that time, the investigator said C.E.C.P. would be home by Christmas.  \n181.  Instead, the government has raised new barriers that have prolonged this family’s \nseparation. Now the government claims to suspect that C.E.C.P. is older than 17. Without \ndisclosing the basis for this suspicion, the case manager requested certified copies of C.E.C.P. \npassport and birth certificates – the same documents Ms. Vazquez produced months ago with the \ninitial sponsorship application.  \n182.  The government’s imposition of new obstacles to reunification without disclosure \nof a legitimate basis, coupled with the requests for duplicative information, frustrate Ms. \nVazquez and impose needless financial costs on her family. \n49 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 55 of 81 PageID# 1314\nE.A.R.R. and his sponsor, Francisco Ramos Chilel \n183.  Plaintiff E.A.R.R., a native of Guatemala, lived with his mother and father until \nhe was about 7, when his father migrated to the United States.  His mother later abandoned him, \nand he moved in with his paternal grandmother until she was unable to care for him. E.A.R.R. \nthen went to live with an adult cousin in Mexico. This cousin abused E.A.R.R., beating him and \nlocking him inside rooms for long periods of time. \n184.  Plaintiff Francisco Ramos Chilel, 41, is E.A.R.R.’s father. For ten years, Mr. \nRamos Chilel has sent his son financial support and spoken to him on a weekly basis. When he \nlearned that E.A.R.R. was being physically abused, he decided E.A.R.R. needed to live with him.   \n185.  Around July 2018, E.A.R.R. entered the United States. He spent several days \nconfined in Texas and was then taken to an emergency shelter for immigrant youth in \nHomestead, Florida. \n186.  Despite not knowing how to read or write, Mr. Ramos Chilel submitted his \nsponsorship application and supporting evidence in July 25, 2018, after paying for assistance.  \n187.  To date, Mr. Ramos Chilel has complied with every requirement caseworkers \nhave put forth. When he was told E.A.R.R. would need his own room, he rented a second room \nin the house where he lived. When he was told all roommates would have to be fingerprinted, he \nasked his roommates, but one refused. When he was encouraged to move, he did so. Though he \ncould not afford rent for a single-family unit, he moved in with his brother and nephew once a \nroom became available in November 2018.  \n188.  Since July 2018, Mr. Ramos Chilel has made three additional submissions in \nresponse to case worker requests, each time paying someone for writing services.  He has been \nfingerprinted, as have a prior roommate, his brother, and his nephew. All four traveled to Miami \nfor fingerprinting at the case worker’s request, which has cost Mr. Ramos Chilel hundreds of \n50 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 56 of 81 PageID# 1315\ndollars in transportation costs. In Mr. Ramos Chilel’s case, delays in fingerprint processing \nextended to 89 days. At that point, the case worker said the results were no longer valid, and told \nhim second prints would be necessary. \n189.  Mr. Chilel’s brother and nephew have also complied with all requests for \ninformation. Besides the fingerprinting, they prepared statements attesting to their lack of \ncriminal history and their encounters with immigration authorities. They also signed releases to \nauthorize background checks for abuse and neglect.  \n190.  Notwithstanding all these efforts, E.A.R.R. remains detained with no explanation \nfor his continued separation from his father. More than five months of detention in the \nHomestead facility have harmed E.A.R.R.’s physical and emotional health. At one point, \nE.A.R.R. suffered from a headache so severe that he broke out in screams, and was taken to a \nhospital. He has become anxious and depressed, and has begun mental health treatment and \nmedication. \n191.  Mr. Ramos Chilel was told by a case worker not to join this suit. Mr. Ramos \nChilel is desperate to alleviate his son’s suffering by getting him out of detention and bringing \nhim home. \nY.R.R.B. and his sponsor, Astrin Melissa Centeno Irias \n192.  Plaintiff Y.R.R.B., 16, grew up in a neighborhood in Honduras that was heavily \ncontrolled by gangs.  He was the victim of gang violence as a child and regularly witnessed \ncrime. \n193.  Y.R.R.B. began working on a bus when he was 14. He collected fares and helped \npassengers embark and disembark.  Gang members would regularly present “extortion letters” to \nthe bus owners, demanding they pay the gangs for permitting them to carry out their routes. \n51 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 57 of 81 PageID# 1316\n194.  Y.R.R.B. fled Honduras because gang members used him to carry extortion \npayments from the bus owner to a “drop,” and Y.R.R.B. did not want to be involved out of fear \nfor his safety. \n195.  Astrin Melissa Centeno Irias is Y.R.R.B.’s sister.  She has lived in Texas with her \nminor son and roommate since 2016.  \n196.  Ms. Centeno Irias has worked with two case managers to be reunified with her \nbrother, and has done everything the case managers asked of her.  She is frustrated because the \ncase managers always seem to come up with more requirements for her, some of which she has \nhad to do more than once.  Y.R.R.B. has been detained for almost four months in the interim. \n197.  Ms. Centeno Irias and her roommate both provided fingerprints on September 27, \n2018.  They were told they would take 4-6 weeks to process. As of January 17th, 2019, Ms. \nCenteno Irias’s roommate’s fingerprints still had not been processed. \n198.  Ms. Centeno Irias and her roommate have both provided copious information on \ntheir work, salaries, and residences over the past five years. Providing this information made Ms. \nCenteno Irias’s roommate uncomfortable, but she did it anyway. Ms. Centeno Irias has also had \nto provide information about her minor child, like his residences and his school.  \n199.  Ms. Centeno Irias was also asked to submit legal records.  From these records the \ncase manager discovered Ms. Centeno Irias and her child had been the victims of domestic \nviolence.  The case manager then asked Ms. Centeno Irias to request the entire archive of \ndocuments related to the abuse. Ms. Centeno Irias went to the Child Protective Services office to \nask for the archive and was told the retrieval could take up to six months. Ms. Centeno Irias \nrelayed the information to the case manager and asked if the documents she had were sufficient.  \n52 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 58 of 81 PageID# 1317\nOn January 17, 2019, the case manager renewed her request for the complete archive of \ndocuments.  \n200.  Since November, Ms. Centeno Irias and her roommate have been asked to submit \ntheir photo identification four separate times.  Most recently, on January 15, 2019, Ms. Centeno \nIrias’s roommate was asked again to submit her photo identification and a list of residences for \nthe last five years. \n201.  Ms. Centeno Irias submitted to a home study in November.  The woman who \nconducted the study told her she expected imminent reunification.  \n202.  While this has been going on, Ms. Centeno Irias worries that Y.R.R.B. is \ndeteriorating in detention.  Y.R.R.B first stayed in a detention center in Kansas City where he \nhad more freedom.  In October of 2018, he got into a fight with another child.  Neither he nor the \nother child were seriously hurt.  That night Y.R.R.B went to bed.  At around three in the \nmorning, he was abruptly awakened, taken out of the facility in the dark, and put on a plane.  \nY.R.R.B kept asking what was going on, but no one would tell him. \n203.  Y.R.R.B was transferred to a staff secure facility in Fife, Washington, Selma \nCarson Home.  Upon arrival, Y.R.R.B was told he had been transferred because he was \nsuspected of being in a gang. Y.R.R.B is upset that he is being accused of the very thing he left \nHonduras to get away from. There’s been no opportunity to defend himself against the \nallegations, yet he feels like he is being punished all the same.   \n204.  Y.R.R.B lives a diminished quality of life at Selma Carson Home.  Only about \neight boys are housed there.  The building is small and dark, with low ceilings.  The boys are \nonly permitted outside one to two hours a day.   \n53 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 59 of 81 PageID# 1318\n205.  Y.R.R.B has grown frustrated with the unchanging situation and with the lack of \nprogress despite his sister’s compliance. Depression and despair have taken hold. Y.R.R.B. feels \nlike his current case manager doesn’t like him, and he doesn’t see her nearly as often as he saw \nhis case manager in Kansas City.  He doesn’t feel confident that she is doing what she can to \nreunite him with his sister.  Y.R.R.B. had begun to give up hope that he would ever be released. \nC.M.M. and his sponsor, Magdalena Miguel \n206.  Plaintiff C.M.M., 15, grew up in Huehuetenango, Guatemala. He never knew his \nfather and was raised by his grandmother. C.M.M. completed less than one year of school in \nGuatemala, and cannot read or write. \n207.  C.M.M.’s native language is Jakaltek.  Like many people in his community, \nC.M.M. had heard some Spanish, but didn’t speak it. C.M.M only began to actively learn \nSpanish when he entered the United States. \n208.  C.M.M. has been at two facilities since he entered the United States about six \nmonths ago.  The first was Casa Padre, in Brownsville, Texas. Currently, he is in Selma Carson \nhome, a staff-secure facility in Fife, Washington. \n209.  Magdalena Miguel is C.M.M.’s mother.  She had C.M.M. when she was very \nyoung and moved to the United States when C.M.M. was a baby.  She lives in Florida with her \nsix daughters. \n210.  Ms. Miguel has had a close relationship with C.M.M. his entire life.  When she \nfound out he was in the United States, she enthusiastically wanted to sponsor him.  \n211.  Ms. Miguel has worked with four case managers since she began the reunification \nprocess.  None of the case managers spoke Jakaltek, and one of the case managers did not even \nspeak Spanish. Ms. Miguel has a friend who, when available, acted as an interpreter with that \nparticular case manager.  \n54 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 60 of 81 PageID# 1319\n212.  Ms. Miguel has done everything the case managers have asked of her.  She has \nsubmitted paperwork, a copy of her ID, a copy of C.M.M.’s birth certificate, and a list of her \ndaughters’ names and birthdates.  She also submitted three copies of her electric bill. In \nSeptember 2018, she was asked to get fingerprinted, so she did.   \n213.  A home inspection was performed in or around October. Ms. Miguel and her \ndaughters live in a two-bedroom apartment. The social worker told Ms. Miguel she’d need to \nhave a separate bedroom for C.M.M., which Ms. Miguel said she’d achieve by giving her room \nto C.M.M. and sleeping on the sofa. \n214.  A social worker also told Ms. Miguel that she would have to install cameras in the \nhouse, but Ms. Miguel didn’t understand why.  \n215.  Ms. Miguel has been very worried about her son, especially since he started \nworking with his newest case manager.  The new case manager made a rule that C.M.M.’s phone \ncalls must be monitored, and she insists that C.M.M speak in Spanish.  She won’t let him use the \nphone if he tries to speak in Jakaltek.  This effectively inhibits their ability to communicate to \none another because C.M.M. only started learning Spanish six months ago, and Spanish is Ms. \nMiguel’s second language.  C.M.M. can’t express himself to her when they are on the phone. \n216.  Moreover, C.M.M. is sad because since his grandmother doesn’t speak any \nSpanish at all, he can’t call her on the phone to see how she is doing even though she is old and \nin frail health. \n217.  C.M.M. feels completely alone and like he has no support. His behavior is \ndefensive and emotional. He often cries and stays in his room on his own. None of the other boys \nat Selma Carson Home speak Jakaltek.  Between this and his case manager’s rules about phone \nuse, C.M.M. has no one he can easily communicate with. \n55 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 61 of 81 PageID# 1320\n218.  Isolation and despair about reuniting with his mother has lead C.M.M. to act out.  \nAs a result, C.M.M. is punished, even for minor offenses.  C.M.M. is not allowed to play team \nsports with the other boys, he is not allowed to share a room, and he is not allowed to share a \nsofa while in the common room.  He takes his classes separately from the other boys. His \nbedroom television and music privileges have been taken away.  He feels trapped and completely \nalone. \n219.  When Ms. Miguel tried to ask her son about an alleged incident that C.M.M. had \ngotten in trouble for, the case manager yelled at Ms. Miguel for bringing up the topic and making \nC.M.M. emotional.  \n220.  Ms. Miguel fears that if he is not released soon, C.M.M. is going to break down \ncompletely. \nA.C.M.S. and her sponsor, Juan Bautista Maldonado Murillo \n221.  Plaintiff A.C.M.S., 17, fled Honduras last fall after being sexually abused and \nexploited.   \n222.  She entered the United States in September of 2018 and was promptly transferred \nto a facility in Seattle, Washington.  \n223.  A.C.M.S’s father Juan Bautista Maldonado Murillo lives in New Jersey, more \nthan 2800 miles away from where his daughter is detained.  \n224.  Mr. Maldonado Murillo was an enthusiastic sponsor of his daughter, and started \nthe reunification process as soon as he found out A.C.M.S was in the United States.  Even \nthough he is illiterate, he completed a lengthy application with the help of his sister-in-law, \nsubmitted finger prints, and paid for and took parenting classes.   \n225.  When Mr. Maldonado Murillo started the sponsorship process, he lived with \nroommates. A.C.M.S.’s case manager told Mr. Maldonado Murillo he would need to get his \n56 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 62 of 81 PageID# 1321\nroommates to submit their fingerprints, but the roommates told Mr. Maldonado Murillo they did \nnot want to.  \n226.  A.C.M.S.’s case manager told Mr. Maldonado Murillo he should find his own \napartment.  Not only was this a great financial strain for Mr. Maldonado Murillo, it was also \nsomething he felt he needed to do quickly to avoid his daughter’s detention from being \nunnecessarily prolonged.  Knowing the situation, Mr. Maldonado Murillo’s brother offered him \nhis apartment to move into.  Mr. Maldonado Murillo moved in and took over the rent payments, \nand his brother moved out.   \n227.  In December, the case manager ordered an inspection of the apartment, and Mr. \nMaldonado Murillo was hopeful the inspection would be the last step in the reunification \nprocess. But it was not, and Mr. Maldonado Murillo does not know why. \n228.  Most recently, A.C.M.S.’s case manager asked Mr. Maldonado to sign a form \nindicating that he is the one living in and paying for the apartment.  Although the case manager \nsays she sent the form, it still has not arrived. \n229.  In the meanwhile, A.C.M.S. has been waiting at the detention center in Seattle, a \nfacility that currently houses between 7 to 12 girls.  There she is receiving counseling to cope \nwith the sexual abuse she suffered in Honduras. \n230.  The detention center has a strict no touch policy. Any kind of touching between \nthe staff and the girls is strictly prohibited.  But in recent weeks, one of the male staffers who \nworks the night shift has been touching the girls, including stroking A.C.M.S.’s arm, and sitting \non the bed and touching the feet of one of A.C.M.S.’s friends.  This has been a triggering \nexperience for A.C.M.S., who continues to cope with the emotional trauma of sexual abuse.  She \n57 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 63 of 81 PageID# 1322\nhas been terrified to sleep at night for fear the staff person will enter her room and do something \nto her.  When she does sleep, she has terrible nightmares and wakes up screaming. \n231.  Four of the girls in the detention center met with the center supervisor to inform \nher of what the staff person had done to them.  The supervisor asked the girls what they wanted \nthe center to do about the situation, and the girls said they wanted the staff member banned from \nentering the center.   \n232.  A.C.M.S. longed for the supervisor’s assurance that the staff member would not \nbe back to work.  However, the center supervisor did not tell the girls she would do as they had \nsuggested; rather, she told them the matter would be investigated. \n233.  A.C.M.S. worries that the male staff member might try to do something to her for \ngetting him in trouble.  Recently, A.C.M.S. saw the staff member drive up, park his car, and \nwalk the grounds of the facility, but he did not come into the shelter. \nCatholic Legal Immigration Network, Inc. \n234.  Plaintiff Catholic Legal Immigration Network, Inc. (“CLINIC”) is a nonprofit \norganization incorporated in Washington, DC. CLINIC’s main office is in Silver Spring, \nMaryland.  CLINIC was founded in 1988. \n235.  CLINIC embraces the core Gospel value of welcoming the stranger. CLINIC \npromotes the dignity and protects the rights of immigrants in partnership with a dedicated \nnetwork of Catholic and community legal immigration programs to whom it provides training \nand technical assistance.  \n236.  CLINIC is the largest nationwide network of nonprofit immigration programs, \nwith approximately 341 affiliates in 47 states and the District of Columbia. Through its affiliates, \nas well as through the BIA Pro Bono Project and the Dilley Pro Bono Project (formerly known \nas the CARA Pro Bono Project), CLINIC advocates for the just and humane treatment of \n58 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 64 of 81 PageID# 1323\nimmigrants through direct representation, pro bono referrals, and engagement with policy \nmakers. \n237.  In response to growing anti-immigrant sentiment and to prepare for policy \nmeasures that hurt immigrant families, CLINIC launched the Defending Vulnerable Populations \nProject. The Defending Vulnerable Populations Project seeks to increase access to competent, \naffordable representation for the most vulnerable immigrants—those at immediate risk of \ndeportation, which includes unaccompanied minors fleeing danger. \n238.  CLINIC also advocates for systemic change to policies and practices that affect \nimmigrants by engaging in litigation, public policy work, and community education.  \n239.  As part of this effort, CLINIC regularly monitors and submits comments on \nproposed federal regulatory changes that impact immigrants. In 2018, CLINIC submitted \ncomments on regulatory changes by the Department of Homeland Security including: comments \nopposing changes that would end the Flores Settlement Agreement and comments opposing a \nDHS system that announced new information collections from potential sponsors of \nunaccompanied children and other adults in the sponsors’ households.  If ORR had provided an \nopportunity to submit public comments on the policies promulgated through the MOA, CLINIC \nwould have submitted comments on such proposals.   \n240.  In the past year, CLINIC has had to divert resources to educate its network and \nimmigrant communities about the potential effects of the MOA. \n241.  Defendants’ ORR policies harm CLINIC by undermining its mission and causing \nit to divert its resources to respond to the family separation crisis Defendants created. \n59 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 65 of 81 PageID# 1324\n242.  As a result of the ORR policies, CLINIC has been forced to direct resources \ntowards identifying and overcoming obstacles to family reunification.  It has taken significant \nresources for CLINIC to develop capacity and expertise.  \n243.  Specifically, since the release of the MOA, CLINIC has had to devote resources \nto this issue through the following activities: \n•  Submitted a comment on the DHS Notice of Modified System of Records, Docket \nNumber DHS-2018-0013 (June 2018); \n \n•  Participated in AILA annual conference meeting on asylum, and prepared for and \nled discussion on the effects of the MOA (June 2018); \n \n•  Spoke with press on this issue including researching and providing background \ninformation (August 2018); \n \n•  Researched and prepared a fact sheet in English and Spanish for Proposed \nSponsors of Unaccompanied Children that informs Sponsors of the risks of \nsponsorship under the new policies and provides sponsors with additional \nresources (November 2018);  \n \n•  Continuing individual technical assistance for direct service providers working \nwith unaccompanied children and their families; and \n \n•  Continuing guidance for families navigating the ORR reunification process. For \nexample, since November 2018 CLINIC has assisted a mother whose two \ndaughters are still in ORR custody in Florida. \n \n244.  The time that CLINIC staff has had to dedicate to these activities has been \ndiverted from time that would have been spent providing assistance in other matters. \n245.  If the ORR policies continue to be in effect, CLINIC anticipates having to shift \neven more staff time to respond to family reunification inquiries and policy matters. \nNorthwest Immigrant Rights Project \n246.  Plaintiff Northwest Immigrant Rights Project (“NWIRP”) is a nonprofit \norganization incorporated in Washington State. NWIRP’s main office is in Seattle, Washington. \n60 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 66 of 81 PageID# 1325\n247.  Established in 1984, NWIRP’s mission is to advance and defend the legal rights \nof immigrants in Washington State. \n248.  Since the 1980s, at the height of a refugee crisis in Central America, NWIRP has \nrepresented children and adults fleeing violence and persecution in this region. To date, NWIRP \nhas represented thousands of children–accompanied and unaccompanied–before immigration \ncourts and other immigration agencies.   \n249.  NWIRP is the largest nonprofit in the western United States dedicated exclusively \nto providing immigration legal services. In 2018, NWIRP submitted more than 4,500 \napplications for immigration benefits on behalf of clients. It is currently assisting more than \n1,200 individuals with removal cases pending in immigration courts.  \n250.  NWIRP uses a range of advocacy strategies to accomplish its mission.  Besides \nseeking immigration benefits for clients before immigration courts and agencies, it vindicates the \ncivil rights of immigrants through federal litigation and engages in policy advocacy on issues \nthat impact immigrants.   \n251.  NWIRP’s policy work spans local, state, and federal governments. At the federal \nlevel, NWIRP regularly monitors and submits comments on proposed rule changes that affect \nimmigrants. In 2018, NWIRP submitted comments on three such proposals, including one to end \nthe settlement in Flores v. Reno, the landmark case setting minimum standards for the care of \nimmigrant minors in federal custody. NWIRP would have submitted comments on the policies \nchallenged in this action if ORR had promulgated the rules through notice and comment \nrulemaking. \n61 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 67 of 81 PageID# 1326\n252.  Because NWIRP is the primary immigration legal services provider in \nWashington, dozens of community organizations refer most requests for assistance from \nimmigrants to NWIRP. \n253.  In the past year, NWIRP has begun to assist parents of children in ORR custody \nin advocating for family reunification. Initially, NWIRP had no protocols for offering such \nrepresentation to potential sponsors, so cases were declined at intake. As requests from adults \nbased in Washington surged, NWIRP inquired with other nonprofit providers and determined \nthat no agency was addressing the mounting need for services caused by the challenged ORR \npolicies. \n254.  NWIRP was compelled to fill that void because it furthered NWIRP’s core \npurpose of defending the legal rights of immigrants in Washington State. In each of the cases, \nparents were being denied fundamental parental rights solely because of their immigration status \nand that of their children. As the primary provider of immigration legal services in Washington, \nit had to take action. \n255.  NWIRP has developed an advocacy strategy that combines efforts at the \nadministrative and legislative levels. Because no avenue exists to appeal denials or delays in \nsponsorship applications, NWIRP staff have pursued alternatives, contacting ORR and shelter \nstaff directly and contacting members of Congress to intervene in problem cases.  \n256.  NWIRP has also directed intake staff to channel such requests for assistance and \nconduct necessary follow-up to gather facts. \n257.  Defendants’ ORR policies harm NWIRP by undermining its mission to advance \nimmigrants’ rights. The policies have also caused NWIRP to channel resources to respond to \nsponsor requests for assistance with family reunification. \n62 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 68 of 81 PageID# 1327\n258.  Because of Defendants’ ORR policies, NWIRP has had to shift resources to \ndevise avenues for reunification advocacy and provide representation to sponsors. \n259.  The longer the ORR policies remain in force, the more staff time will be required \nto work on family reunification cases. And since some of NWIRP’s funding sources compensate \nNWIRP on the basis of number of cases handled, NWIRP may lose resources as a result of \nhaving to divert staff time to family reunification activities. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n260.  This case is brought as a class action pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \n23(a) and 23(b)(2), or in the alternative, as a representative habeas action on behalf of the \nfollowing classes: \n(1) Detained Children Class: All children who: \na.  are or will be in the custody of ORR, anywhere in the United States; \nb.  at any date on or after July 20, 2018; and \nc.  for whom a potential sponsor has begun the sponsorship application process, \nand who has not yet been released to that sponsor. \n(2) Sponsor Class: All individuals, anywhere in the United States, who: \na.  have initiated the sponsorship process to sponsor a member of the Detained \nChildren Class; \nb.  by either \ni.  returning a family reunification packet to ORR or to an ORR-\ncontracted caseworker, or \nii.  otherwise formally advising ORR or an ORR-contracted caseworker of \ntheir desire or willingness to sponsor a child; and \nc.  to whom the Detained Children classmember has not been released.  \n261.  Plaintiffs reserve the right to amend the class definitions if discovery or further \ninvestigation reveals that the classes should be expanded or otherwise modified. \n63 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 69 of 81 PageID# 1328\n262.  Plaintiffs reserve the right to establish sub-classes as appropriate. \n263.  This action is brought and properly may be maintained as a class action under  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1)-(4). \n264.  Numerosity: With over 10,000 children detained by ORR nationwide, the \nproposed classes are sufficiently numerous so as to render joinder impracticable. Moreover, \nadditional children will continue to enter the class in the future on a regular basis.  \n265.  Joinder is also impractical because the proposed Detained Children Class consists \nof children who are separated from their families and other adult caretakers, many of whom are \nindigent, have limited English proficiency, and/or have a limited understanding of the U.S. \njudicial system.  The proposed Sponsor Class consists of adults across the country who are \nattempting to sponsor UACs in ORR custody, many of whom are indigent, have limited English \nproficiency, and/or have a limited understanding of the U.S. judicial system. The guarantee of \nfuture unidentified class members renders joinder impractical.  \n266.  Commonality: Common questions of law and fact affect class members, \nincluding: \n(a) whether the Government is in compliance with its obligations under the \nTVPRA to promptly place children in the least restrictive setting possible;  \n(b) whether the government’s reunification policies, establishing the discretionary \nand opaque decision-making system described in §§ 2.2.3, 2.2.4, 2.4.1, and 2.4.2, which \nimpact all children in ORR custody and all potential sponsors, violate UACs and their \nsponsors’ due process rights by creating a system in which case managers make the \nmajority of reunification decisions without any notice or opportunity for UACs or \n64 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 70 of 81 PageID# 1329\nsponsors to be heard, regarding either additional discretionary requirements imposed by \ncase managers, or non-viability decisions made by case managers;  \n(c) whether the blanket sharing of sponsors’ biometric and biographic information \nwith DHS for immigration enforcement purposes is in compliance with ORR’s obligations \nunder the TVPRA to promptly place children in the least restrictive setting possible;  \n(d) whether the blanket sharing of sponsors’ biometric and biographic information \nwith DHS for immigration enforcement purposes were unlawfully promulgated through \nan online Policy Guide and MOA between ORR and DHS in a manner not in accordance \nwith the APA; and \n(e) whether the blanket sharing of sponsors’ biometric and biographic information \nwith DHS for immigration enforcement purposes are arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise \ncontrary to law under the APA. \n267.  Both the Detained Children Class and the Sponsor Class are negatively impacted \nby the same ORR policies, either now or in the imminent future. A finding that these policies \nwere promulgated in violation of the APA, the TVPRA, or operate in violation of the Due \nProcess Clause would remove the same barriers from all members of both classes in a single \nstroke. \n268.   Typicality: Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the proposed class, as all \nmembers of the Detained Children Class are subject to prolonged detention because of ORR’s \nunlawful policies, violating the TVPRA and their due process rights, and issued in violation of \nthe APA as set forth herein; and all members of the Sponsor Class are denied their ability to \nsponsor their loved ones because of ORR’s unlawful policies violating their due process rights \nand issued in violation of the APA as set forth herein.  \n65 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 71 of 81 PageID# 1330\n269.  While the child Plaintiffs are seeking immediate release, having already suffered \nserious harms and infringement of their constitutional rights under the policies set forth herein, \nPlaintiffs recognize that not all UACs will be immediately released if the Plaintiff classes win \nthis case. This does not defeat typicality, however, because if Plaintiff classes are successful, \nevery class member will significantly benefit from a judgment in their favor. Requiring ORR to \ncome into compliance with the TVPRA obligations to place children promptly in the least \nrestrictive environment, including with their families, that is in the best interests of the child will \nreduce the institutionalization of immigrant children and promote their best interests, as intended \nby the statute. Requiring ORR to revise its policies to come into compliance with due process \nrequirements will serve to protect the due process rights of members of both classes. Enjoining \nORR and ICE’s MOA, including enjoining ORR from implementing expanded information \ncollection and from transferring information to DHS, unless specifically warranted by an \nindividual case, will significantly speed up the reunification process for all class members and \nwill allow the most appropriate caregivers to proceed with the reunification process.  \n270.   Adequacy: Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \nproposed classes. Plaintiffs’ claims are identical to the members of the proposed classes, they \nhave no relevant conflicts of interest with other members of the proposed classes, and they have \nretained competent counsel experienced in class-action and immigration law.  \n271.  This action is brought and properly may be maintained as a class action under \nFederal Rule 23(b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3). \n272.  Separate actions by or against individual class members would create a risk of \ninconsistent or varying adjudications regarding the legality of ORR’s policies as set forth herein. \n66 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 72 of 81 PageID# 1331\n273.  The U.S. government presently takes the position that its policies as set forth \nherein are lawfully promulgated, and to the extent that this causes the prolonged detention of \nimmigrant children, such detention is a regrettable necessity. Thus, Respondents have acted or \nrefused to act on grounds that apply generally to the proposed class, so that final injunctive relief \nor corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate with respect to the proposed class as a whole. \n274.  Common questions of law or fact predominate over questions affecting only \nindividual members, and a class action is thus superior to other available methods for fairly and \nefficiently adjudicating the controversy. Even if individual class members had the resources to \nbring individual lawsuits (which most do not), it would be unduly burdensome to the courts in \nwhich the individual litigation would proceed. Individual litigation magnifies the delay and \nexpense to all parties, and to the court. Respondents have engaged in a common course of \nconduct, and the class action device allows a single court to provide the benefits of unitary \nadjudication, judicial economy, and the fair and equitable handling of all class members’ \ncommon claims in a single forum. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nCOUNT I \nVIOLATION OF TVPRA/HABEAS CORPUS  \n(All Child Plaintiffs and the Detained Children Class, Against All Defendants) \n \n275.  Plaintiffs/Petitioners allege and incorporate by reference all of the foregoing \nallegations as though fully set forth herein. \n276.  The William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of \n2008 requires Defendants to promptly place unaccompanied minors in their custody in the least \nrestrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child.  \n67 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 73 of 81 PageID# 1332\n277.  The child Plaintiffs and the Detained Children Classmembers seek to represent a \nclass of unaccompanied minors, and their sponsors are the individuals who, in the best interests \nof the child, offer the least restrictive setting to the UACs whom they are attempting to sponsor.  \n278.  Defendants’ actions in establishing and carrying out opaque reunification policies \nwith little to no due process protections, instituting the MOA and the associated ORR policies, \nand continuing the ICE fingerprint sharing policy by means of the December 18 Suallog \nMemorandum, all prevent the prompt placement of minors in the least restrictive setting and in \nthe best interests of the child, in violation of the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims \nProtection Reauthorization Act of 2008.  \nCOUNT II \nVIOLATION OF SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS 29 \n(All child and sponsor Plaintiffs and the Detained Children and Sponsor Classes, Against \nAll Defendants) \n \n279.  Plaintiffs allege and incorporate by reference all of the foregoing allegations as \nthough fully set forth herein. \n280.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment applies to all “persons” on \nUnited States soil and thus applies to all child and sponsor Plaintiffs and the Detained Children \nand Sponsor Classes.  \n281.  The government violates due process when it separates a family in order to \ngenerally deter illegal immigration. Ms. L. v. ICE, 310 F.Supp.3d 1133 (S.D. Cal. 2018). \n                                                 \n29 A substantive due process claim based on a legal theory involving the fundamental \nright to family unity was dismissed by the Court [Dkt. #60 at pp. 34-37]. Subsequently, the \nmemorandum attached hereto at Exh. 5 was released to the public, making clear that the sole \npurpose of the MOA challenged in this lawsuit was to deter immigration. Accordingly, Plaintiffs \nherein plead an entirely different substantive due process claim herein, based on these newly \nrevealed facts and under the legal theory of Ms. L. v. ICE, 310 F.Supp.3d 1133 (S.D. Cal. 2018) \nand R.I.L-R v. Johnson, 80 F. Supp. 3d 164 (D.D.C. 2015). \n68 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 74 of 81 PageID# 1333\n282.  The government violates due process when it detains an individual—especially a \nchild—in order to generally deter illegal immigration. R.I.L-R v. Johnson, 80 F. Supp. 3d 164 \n(D.D.C. 2015). \n283.  As set forth above, Defendants entered into the MOA challenged in this lawsuit \nfor the purpose of generally deterring illegal immigration, causing the prolonged detention of the \nchild Plaintiffs and the Detained Children Class and their separation from the sponsor Plaintiffs \nand the Sponsor Class, in violation of their right to substantive due process.  \nCOUNT III \nVIOLATION OF PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS \n(All child and sponsor Plaintiffs and the Detained Children and Sponsor Classes, Against \nAll Defendants) \n  \n284.  Plaintiffs allege and incorporate by reference all of the foregoing allegations as \nthough fully set forth herein. \n285.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment applies to all “persons” on \nUnited States soil and thus applies to Petitioners and all classmembers.  \n286.  The child Plaintiffs and the Detained Children Classmembers have a liberty \ninterest in remaining free of government custody, and in being unified with their families.  \n287.  As set forth above, ORR policies creating an opaque, highly discretionary \nreunification process, ORR’s recent MOA and associated ORR polices, and the decision in the \nDecember 18 Suallog Memorandum to continue the ICE fingerprint sharing policy, all contribute \nto the prolonged, unexplained detention of the child Plaintiffs and the Detained Children \nClassmembers, and their separation from their sponsors and families. This violates procedural \ndue process because they deprive these children of their liberty from government custody \nwithout notice or any opportunity to be heard, and cause injury of the children in the form of \nprolonged detention. \n69 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 75 of 81 PageID# 1334\n288.  Likewise, these policies violate procedural due process because they deprive the \nSponsor Classmembers of their right to provide care and upbringing to their loved ones, causing \ninjury to the sponsors in the form of prolonged denial of the right to family unity. \n289.  In addition, the lack of due process protections, including the lack of written \nnotice of denial or non-viability of sponsorship in the early stages of the reunification process \n(prior to an official denial by ORR), violates all Classmembers’ due process rights because it \ndeprives both child and sponsor of meaningful notice of denial, the reasons for denial, and an \nopportunity to be heard challenging the denial and/or the reasons on which it was based.  \nCOUNT IV \nVIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT PROCEDURES FOR \nPROMULGATING AGENCY POLICIES \n(All Plaintiffs Against All Defendants) \n \n290.  Plaintiffs allege and incorporate by reference all of the foregoing allegations as \nthough fully set forth herein. \n291.  Plaintiffs and the classmembers have been aggrieved by Defendants’ action in \nrequiring that all sponsors, and in many cases all adult household members of all sponsors, \nsubmit biometric and biographical information to be shared with DHS for the purpose of \nimmigration enforcement before Defendants will release any child Plaintiff to his or her sponsor. \nThis constitutes final agency action. Yet ORR has not promulgated rules that provide procedures \nfor challenging ORR’s Policy Guide or the policies unlawfully promulgated through the MOA. \nThe agency’s action determined the rights of Plaintiffs and has the legal consequence of keeping \nthis class of children in ORR custody, and depriving their sponsors of their right to family unity. \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs are entitled to judicial review of ORR’s actions under 5 U.S.C. § 704.  \n292.  The Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) requires agency rules to be \npromulgated through the notice and comment process.   \n70 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 76 of 81 PageID# 1335\n293.  The APA defines a “rule” as “an agency statement of general or particular \napplicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or \ndescribing the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of an agency.” 5 U.S.C. \n§551(4).  \n294.  The ORR describes its Guide for Children Entering the United States \nUnaccompanied (“ORR Guide”) as detailing “ORR policies for the placement, release and care \nof unaccompanied alien children in ORR custody.” Exh. 1 at Intro. The biometric information \nrequirement is contained in Section 2.6 of the Guide. Id. \n295.  The APA requires that an agency first publish in the Federal Register the agency’s \nproposed rules and its claim of statutory authority for those rules to provide notice to the public, \nthen give the public an opportunity to comment on the proposed rules, and then publish the final \nrules in the Federal Register at least 30 days before the effective date. 5 U.S.C. §§ 552(a)(1)(C)-\n(D), 553(b)-(d). ORR ignored all of these APA requirements and instead posted the ORR Guide \non its website and began immediate enforcement of the requirements. See Exh. 1. Moreover, the \nORR failed to articulate any explanation, much less a rational one, as to the MOA and the \nvarious 2018 amendments to Section 2.5 and 2.6 and the various subsections thereof relating to \nfingerprinting and fingerprint sharing with DHS. The reviewing court judges the agency’s action \nby the grounds invoked by the agency, and where, as here, those grounds are inadequate or \nimproper then the court is powerless to affirm the administrative action. Sec. & Exch. Comm’n v. \nChenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 196 (1947). \n296.  Accordingly, under 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(1), (2)(A), (2)(C), and (2)(D), this court \nshould set aside the MOA and the various 2018 amendments to Section 2.5 and 2.6 and the \nvarious subsections thereof relating to fingerprinting and fingerprint sharing with DHS, and the \n71 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 77 of 81 PageID# 1336\ndecision in the December 18 Suallog Memorandum to continue the ICE fingerprint sharing \npolicy, as being arbitrary and capricious, in excess of statutory jurisdiction and for failure to \nobserve the procedures required by the APA. \n297.  Plaintiffs have exhausted all administrative remedies available to them as of right. \n298.  Plaintiffs have no recourse to judicial review other than by this action.  \nCOUNT V \nVIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT PROHIBITION ON \nARBITRARY, CAPRICIOUS, AND UNLAWFUL GOVERNMENT ACTION  \n(All Plaintiffs Against All Defendants) \n \n299.  Plaintiffs allege and incorporate by reference all of the foregoing allegations as \nthough fully set forth herein. \n300.  Plaintiffs have been aggrieved by agency action under the Administrative \nProcedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701 et seq. First, the agency’s action entering into the MOA and the \nvarious 2018 amendments to Section 2.5 and 2.6 and the various subsections thereof relating to \nfingerprinting and fingerprint sharing with DHS, and the decision in the December 18 Suallog \nMemorandum to continue the ICE fingerprint sharing policy, is final agency action that is \narbitrary, capricious, and otherwise not in accordance with law. Second, this unlawful agency \naction led to ORR’s final decisions not to release the child Plaintiffs and the Detained Children \nClass pending additional fingerprinting and information sharing with DHS, despite ORR staff \nroutinely recommending that these children be released to their sponsors. This second agency \naction is likewise arbitrary, capricious, and not in accordance with law.  Further, the MOA and \nassociated ORR policies are arbitrary, capricious, and otherwise not in accordance with law \nbecause, as demonstrated in the memorandum attached hereto as Exh. 5, the primary intent and \npurpose of these policies was to assist ICE in enforcing civil immigration laws against sponsors \nand their household members—a purpose that not only has no relationship to ORR’s mission, but \n72 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 78 of 81 PageID# 1337\nactually runs contrary to ORR’s statutory obligation to act in the best interests of the children in \nits care. \n301.  In addition, Defendants’ detention of the child Plaintiffs and the Detained \nChildren Class and their failure to release these children promptly into the custody of their \ncapable and appropriate sponsors is arbitrary and capricious and otherwise not in accordance \nwith law by, inter alia, either ignoring applicable provisions of the Flores Agreement and the \nTVPRA or interpreting those provisions in a manner that frustrates their underlying purpose, and \nby imposing unreasonable and unnecessary conditions precedent to releasing UACs to a suitable \nsponsor.    \n302.  Plaintiffs have exhausted all administrative remedies available to them as of right. \n303.  Plaintiffs have no recourse to judicial review other than by this action. \nCOUNT VI \nHABEAS CORPUS \n(All Child Plaintiffs and the Detained Children Class Against All Defendants and All \nHabeas Corpus Respondents) \n \n304.  As set forth above, Defendants are holding the child Petitioners/Plaintiffs30 and \nthe Detained Children’s Classmembers in federal custody, in violation of federal statutes and the \nU.S. Constitution, and Petitioners/Plaintiffs and the class of children similarly situated \naccordingly seek a writ of habeas corpus. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated, \nrespectfully request that the Court: \nA.   Assume jurisdiction over this matter; \n                                                 \n30 A habeas corpus cause of action is stated as to J.E.C.M., R.A.I. and K.T.M. in their \ncapacities as class representatives only.  \n73 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 79 of 81 PageID# 1338\nB.  Certify the Detained Children Class and the Sponsor Class, as set forth above, and \nappoint Legal Aid Justice Center and the Southern Poverty Law Center as class counsel for both \nclasses; \nC.  Order the Respondents to promptly identify all classmembers to class counsel, \nand to notify all classmembers (and their attorneys of record, if any) of their status as \nclassmembers in this action; \nE.   Declare that Sections 2.2.3, 2.2.4, 2.4.1, and 2.4.2 of Defendant’s ORR Guide \ncreate a reunification process that violates Plaintiffs’ due process rights and require Defendants \nto promptly bring their reunification process, as described in Sections 2.2.3, 2.2.4, 2.4.1, and \n2.4.2 of the ORR Guide, into compliance with the Due Process Clause of the Constitution \nproviding for adequate due process protections at each stage of the reunification process.  \nF.   Declare that the MOA and the various 2018 amendments to Section 2.5 and 2.6 \nand the various subsections thereof relating to fingerprinting and fingerprint sharing with DHS, \nand the decision in the December 18 Suallog Memorandum to continue the ICE fingerprint \nsharing policy, violate the TVPRA, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Due Process \nClause; \nG.  Issue a writ of habeas corpus to any Petitioner/Plaintiff and any member of the \nDetained Children Class whose continued detention by ORR is based solely on any enjoined \nprovision; \nH.  Order Defendants to immediately release to their sponsor any member of the \nDetained Children Class whose continued detention by ORR is based solely on any enjoined \nprovision;   \n74 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00903-LMB-MSN   Document 72-1   Filed 01/18/19   Page 80 of 81 PageID# 1339\nI.  Maintain jurisdiction to oversee implementation of the above-requested relief for \na reasonable period of time; \nJ.  Award the named plaintiffs and other members of the proposed classes reasonable \nattorneys’ fees and costs for this action, pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. § \n504, 28 U.S.C. § 2412; and  \nK.
