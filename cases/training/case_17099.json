    "summary": "<p>On December 19, 2017, an immigrant previously detained from 2012 through 2015 at the Adelanto Detention Center, a civil immigration detention facility, filed this putative class action in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The plaintiff sued GEO Group (GEO), a private company that owned and operated the Adelanto Facility for profit, under the Trafficking Victim Protection Act and California Minimum Wage Law. The plaintiff, represented by private counsel, sought monetary, declaratory, and injunctive relief, claiming violations of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act and California state law. Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that GEO maintained a practice of wage theft, unjust enrichment, and forced labor. The plaintiff alleged that GEO used detainee labor to maximize its own profits, paying detainees just $1 per day to maintain and operate the facility. Because Adelanto Facility had a practice of withholding necessary care to ensure a supply of labor, the plaintiff alleged that the labor was involuntary because detainees were forced to work in order to buy basic necessities that GEO did not provide.</p>\r\n<p>On February 16, 2018, the defendants moved to dismiss the claim, alleging that the plaintiff had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The plaintiffs submitted a first amended complaint on July 6, 2018 with no significant deviations from their original complaint. The defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint on July 20, 2018. The plaintiffs submitted a second amended complaint on December 24, 2018, adding a plaintiff. On September 16, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint, adding plaintiffs, a claim of forced and attempted forced labor, and a claim that the defendant&rsquo;s counterclaims were a form of retaliation.</p>\r\n<p>In its counterclaims, the defendants claimed that if the plaintiffs prevailed then the defendants would be entitled to all costs and expenses in excess of the $1.00 daily rate paid to them associated with detention because otherwise plaintiffs would be unjustly enriched. This prompted the plaintiff to file an additional counterclaim, alleging that the defendant&rsquo;s counterclaim was a form of retaliation against the plaintiffs. On November 30, 2018, the court issued an order granting a stipulation to dismiss with prejudice the defendant&rsquo;s first counterclaim. In response, the defendants filed an additional counterclaim seeking declaratory relief on December 19, 2018. Both parties continued to file counterclaims against one another: the plaintiffs claimed that the defendant&rsquo;s counterclaims were a form of retaliation; and the defendant sought declaratory relief that no employment relationship existed between GEO and the detainees who participated in the Voluntary Work Program.</p>\r\n<p>On September 27, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a motion to certify a class of &ldquo;all civil immigration detainees who performed work for GEO at the Adelanto Detention Center in the Work Program since GEO assumed responsibility for the Facility in May 2011.&rdquo; On November 26, 2019, Judge Jesus G. Bernal granted plaintiffs' motion to certify this class.</p>\r\n<p>On April 6, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order that would direct GEO to either (1) halt the use of class members in the provision of work or services under the work program, or (2) protect class members by providing protective clothing, antiseptic supplies, and testing for COVID-19. The plaintiffs simultaneously filed a motion for expedited discovery for their requests that pertained to their motion. Following oral argument, on April 22, the judge denied the plaintiffs' application for a temporary restraining order.</p>\r\n<p>Relatively little happened over the summer of 2020. The parties engaged in apparently contentious litigation over discovery, with the defendants requesting to reopen discovery from February of 2021 to June of 2021. On November 19, 2020, the parties attended a conference regarding the continued discovery dispute and following conversation between the parties, a hearing was scheduled for the following week.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment on December 21, 2020, requesting that the court find the defendant liable for wage theft, unjust enrichment, and unfair competition; reject the defendants' affirmative defenses, and dismiss defendants' conditional counterclaim for declaratory relief. The defendants filed a cross motion for summary judgment and for a hearing to decertify the class.</p>\r\n<p>On January 25, 2022, Judge Bernal granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment with regard to their claims that GEO Group violated California's Minimum Wage and Unfair Competition laws. The court found that GEO&rsquo;s control over detainees' wages, hours, and working conditions was sufficient to establish them as an employer. Since it was undisputed that GEO paid detainees $1 per day, regardless of hours worked, the plaintiffs had successfully established a violation of California's minimum wage law. These facts also established a violation of California's unfair competition law, which defined &ldquo;unfair competition&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />as &ldquo;any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice . . . \" Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 17200.</p>\r\n<p>The court concluded that there were genuine issues of material fact as to the plaintiffs' unjust enrichment and forced labor claims. The court dismissed the defendants' assertion of three affirmative defenses: derivative sovereign immunity, preemption, and lack of standing to seek injunctive relief, finding that:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>GEO Group had discretion to pay detainees more than $1/day;</li>\r\n<li>GEO Group had failed to show why compliance with both state and federal regulations was impossible; and</li>\r\n<li>at least some of the named plaintiffs had standing to seek injunctive relief.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>One month later, the defendants moved to stay the case pending a Ninth Circuit appeal in a similar case, <a href=\"../../../../case/16387\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Nwauzor v. The GEO Group, Inc</em></a>. The court granted this motion; as of July 2025 the case is stayed but ongoing.</p>",

I  am the  Facility Administrator  at  the  LaSalle  ICE  Processing  Center \n9 \n(\"LIPC\" or \"GEO\"). I am over the age of eighteen (18), and I am competent to testify \n10 \nin this matter. My statement is based upon my personal knowledge, and my education, \n11 \ntraining, and experience. \n:22Ef`ti 12 \n2.  The LIPC has implemented rigorous processes to reduce the exposure of \nP  ,1';1 13\nL the detainee population to COVID-19 and to ensure that procedures are put in place to \nL\nN  C17 0  14 \nA avoid the spread of COVID-19 in the event that COVID-19 were to be introduced to \nM\nR wad 15 \nE the LIPC. \nK Ltilig<3 \nA 'nz,c;16 \n3.  Attached as Exhibit A is a true and correct copy of the Center for Disease \njj°,.7j 17 \nControl and Prevention (\"CDC\") Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus \n18 \nDisease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities. GEO utilized this \n19 \nguidance to educate its personnel and detainees at the LIPC about COVID-19. GEO \n20 \nfurther  utilized  this  guidance  to  develop  its  policies  and  practices  for  addressing \n21 \nCOVID-19.  My  declaration  below  provides  some  specifics  about  GEO 's \n22 \nimplementation of the guidelines at LIPC. I have not attempted to describe in totality \n23 \neach and every action taken by the facilities and GEO staff to implement the guidelines \n24 \nor any other precautions, nor could I do so within the limitations of a publicly filed \n25 \ndeclaration. However, I hope to convey to the Court that GEO is being proactive and is \n26 \ntaking COVID-19 seriously to reduce the risk of infection. \n27 \n28  52654338 \n2  CASE No. 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHKx \nDECLARATION OF DAVID COLE IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANT THE GEO GROUP, INC.'S \nOPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-3   Filed 04/08/20   Page 4 of 34   Page ID\n #:5401\n1  4.  The health, safety, and well-being of detainees at LIPC correlates with the \n2  health, safety, and well-being of GEO staff, GEO administration, and our families. Our \n3  interests are aligned with respect to mitigation strategies to  slow the spread of the \n4  coronavirus and resulting infections of COVID-19. \n5  5.  To date, there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the LIPC detainee \n6  population. \n7  6.  GEO  has  held  multiple  town  hall  meetings  for  detainees,  since  the \n8  beginning of March about COVID-19 to try to educate the population about COVID-\n9  19. \n10  7.  As with all others across the  country, we are continuing to evolve our \npractices  as  we  learn  more  about  COVID-19.  We  continue  to  implement \nsupplementary  safety  measures,  in  addition  to  those  listed  below,  as  information \nbecomes available. \nSocial Distancing and Access Limitations \n1.  The LIPC has implemented a number of limitations, in connection with \nICE,  to  reduce  the  introduction  of any  outside  sources  of contamination  into  the \nfacility. \n2.  Limited Visitation:  ICE has temporarily stopped all  in-person  visitation \n19  for detainees and their family and friends with the exception of detainees' attorney \n20  visits.  Attorneys  who  wish  to  enter  the  building  must  wear  Personal  Protective \n21  Equipment (\"PPE\") including a surgical  mask, goggles, and gloves. Otherwise, all \n22  visits are restricted to videoconferencing on tablets that are provided to detainees. \n23  3.  Anyone Entering the LIPC Facility: Any individual who enters the facility \n24  must first complete a screening questionnaire to determine whether the individual has a \n25  likelihood of exposure to COVID-19. This includes all GEO staff, medical staff, ICE \n26  staff and other regular personnel within the building, as well as those who arrive for \n27 \n28  52654338;1 \n3  CASE No. 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHKx \nDECLARATION OF DAVID COLE IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANT THE GEO GROUP, INC.'S \nOPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-3   Filed 04/08/20   Page 5 of 34   Page ID\n #:5402\n1  purposes of attending proceedings at the immigration court within the LIPC Facility. \n2  Thereafter, GEO staff take the temperature of all individuals seeking entry. Anyone \n3  who presents with a fever must return home until cleared by a medical professional. \n4  Staff are not permitted to work when they are sick and are advised to stay home if they \n5  develop symptoms of COVID-19 or come into contact with someone who has been \n6  exposed. All staff who are potentially exposed have been instructed to follow CDC \n7  guidelines  for  self isolation  and  medical  care.  GEO  has  established a  clearance \n8  protocol  for  anyone that  has been denied  access  to  the  facility due  to  COVID-19 \n9  concerns. \n10  4.  Contractors:  Non-emergency  contractors  are  not  presently  permitted \n11  within the LIPC facility. \nN \n`E3r  2  5.  IncominL1 Detainees:  The LIPC has also placed restrictions on any new \n,W,;13  detainees  who  arrive  at  the  facility  for  detention.  All  detainees  are  screened  for \nwo \n14  COVID-19  exposure  prior  to  entering  the  building.  After  a  medical  professional \ncnu\nwad 15  confirms that there are no clinical signs of COVID-19, and that their travel history does \nc'o \nupz,.;16  not raise significant concerns of exposure. Detainees arrive at LIPC from any location \nother than another ICE facility where they have been screened for COVID-19, are \nE-\n18  housed a different  facility, away from  LaSalle's existing population, until  they  can \n19  complete a 14-day quarantine period. \n20  6.  Social  Distancing  within  Living  Units:  GEO  has  opened  all  units  to \n21  provide for additional space for each detainee in his or her living unit. As a result, the \n22  current population in each pod or dorm significantly less than total capacity of each \n23  unit.  For detainees who are in dorm-style housing, detainees are housed with ample \n24  space between them through reduced capacity. \n25  7.  Social Distancing for Other Activities:  GEO has temporarily ended  all \n26  visits from volunteers to reduce the exposure to outside pathogens. Detainees may still \n27 \n28  52654338; I \n4  CASE No. 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHKx \nDECLARATION OF DAVID COLE IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANT THE GEO GROUP, INC.'S \nOPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-3   Filed 04/08/20   Page 6 of 34   Page ID\n #:5403\n1  use  the  law  library,  but  social  distancing  is  practiced  by  limiting  the  number  of \n2  individuals in the law library at any one time. Detainees may still engage in recreation \n3  but the number of individuals engaged at a time is limited to a number whereby six (6) \n4  feet of distance can be maintained between each detainee. Detainees no longer share \n5  recreation time with other housing units and instead are limited to interactions with \n6  their own housing units. Further, all equipment is cleaned and disinfected between \n7  each use. \n8  Enhanced Hygiene Practices \n9  8.  Supplies: I have assessed GEO's stock of soap and cleaning supplies and \n10  all supplies are stocked and not at risk of depleting in the near future. Further, there are \n11  adequate supplies to provide hand sanitizer throughout the facility. I have a plan in \nN \nrn\n12 place  to  keep  supply  stocks  replenished  as  needed.  GEO  uses  approved  cleaning \nX\nW0,1 \n1_,C7N,C \n13 products. GEO uses EPA approved cleaning products that have been demonstrated to \nCnZRi   \nHaom..\nbe  effective  against  the  coronavirus,  more  specifically  the  HDQ  cleaning product \nmaw''5   4 \ncno . \n-c> 15  which appears on \"List N\" of the EPA's approved list of cleaners.

The LaSalle ICE Processing Center currently has an ample supply \n18  of this cleaning product, which is used to disinfect all hard surfaces. \n19  9.  Intensified  Cleaning.  GEO  has  implemented  intensified  cleaning  of \n20  surfaces and objects that are frequently touched, both inside and outside of the secured \n21  perimeter. GEO's new policy requires that at a minimum four times a day, all hard \n22  surfaces and high-touch areas are cleaned and sanitized, including tables, doorknobs, \n23  telephones. GEO uses EPA-registered disinfectants that are represented to be effective \n24  against the virus that causes COVID - 19. GEO is not diluting disinfectants below \n25  effective  levels.  GEO  has  gloves  for  use with  cleaning.  Detainees  have  access  to \n26  additional bottles of disinfectant in their housing units. \n27 \n28  52654338; I \n5  CASE No. 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHKx \nDECLARATION OF DAVID COLE IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANT THE GEO GROUP, INC.'S \nOPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-3   Filed 04/08/20   Page 7 of 34   Page ID\n #:5404\n1  10.  Reinforced Hygiene: GEO has reinforced healthy Hygiene practices and \n2  has made supplied available to encourage safe hygiene practices. GEO plays a video \n3  on a loop in all housing areas that demonstrates the proper handwashing technique. \n4  GEO  has  also  made  the  CDC  information  related  to  COVID-19  available  to  all \n5  detainees. \n6  11.  We are in the process of installing hand sanitizer stations at the front of \n7  each housing unit. \n8  12.  All detainees are provided with personal soap and may replenish their \n9  soap anytime it runs out. There is no risk that detainees do not receive soap. \n10  13.  In addition to their personal soap, detainees have access to additional soap \n11  at handwashing facilities. \nO Fs  12 14.  There is also additional soap in the recreation yard for hand washing. \n15.  No detainee has ever been required to use shampoo in lieu of soap of \nL.T.a\n14  cleaning products. \nEl \nf— < \nHvca' 15  16.  There is one detainee who was separated at the request of the medical \n\"16  services provided by ICE because she is of a higher risk of the illness. She is in a safe \nr`,\n0  • • 17  area away from other detainees for her own protection and receives extensive medical \n18  care consistent with her conditions. \n19  17.  All medical care is provided by the ICE Health Service Corps. (\"IHSC\"). \n20  Information about the number of detainees who have been tested would need to be \n21  obtained from IHSC. \n22  I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States of America \n23  that the foregoing is true and correct and that I executed this Declaration on the 8th day \n24  of April, 2020, in Jena, Louisiana. \n25 \n26  David Cole, Declarant \n27 \n28  52654338;1 \n6  CASE No. 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHKx \nDECLARATION OF DAVID COLE IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANT THE GEO GROUP, INC.'S \nOPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-3   Filed 04/08/20   Page 8 of 34   Page ID\n #:5405\nEXHIBIT A \nto Declaration of \nDavid Cole\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-3   Filed 04/08/20   Page 9 of 34   Page ID\n #:5406\nCenters for Disease \nControl and Prevention \nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) \nInterim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus \nDisease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and \nDetention Facilities \nThis interim guidance is based on what is currently known about the transmission and severity of coronavirus \ndisease 2019 (COVID-19) as of the date of posting, March 23, 2020. \nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will update this guidance as needed and as additional \ninformation becomes available. Please check the CDC website periodically for updated interim guidance. \nThis document provides interim guidance specific for correctional facilities and detention centers during the \noutbreak of COVID-19, to ensure continuation of essential public services and protection of the health and safety of \nincarcerated and detained persons, staff, and visitors. Recommendations may need to be revised as more \ninformation becomes available. \nWho is the intended audience for this guidance? \nThis document is intended to provide guiding principles for healthcare and non-healthcare administrators of correctional \nand detention facilities (including but not limited to federal and state prisons, local jails, and detention centers), law \nenforcement agencies that have custodial authority for detained populations (i.e., US Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement and US Marshals Service), and their respective health departments, to assist in preparing for potential \nintroduction, spread, and mitigation of COVID-19 in their facilities. In general, the document uses terminology referring to \ncorrectional environments but can also be applied to civil and pre-trial detention settings. \nThis guidance will not necessarily address every possible custodial setting and may not use legal terminology specific to \nindividual agencies' authorities or processes. The guidance may need to be adapted based on individual facilities' \nphysical space, staffing, population, operations, and other resources and conditions. Facilities should contact \nCDC or their state, local, territorial, and/or tribal public health department if they need assistance in applying these \nprinciples or addressing topics that are not specifically covered in this guidance. \nWhy is this guidance being issued? \nCorrectional and detention facilities can include custody, housing, education, recreation, healthcare, food service, and \nworkplace components in a single physical setting. The integration of these components presents unique challenges for \ncontrol of COVID-19 transmission among incarcerated/detained persons, staff, and visitors. Consistent application of \nspecific preparation, prevention, and management measures can help reduce the risk of transmission and severe disease \nfrom COVID-19. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 1 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-3   Filed 04/08/20   Page 10 of 34   Page ID\n #:5407\n•  Incarcerated/detained persons live, work, eat, study, and recreate within congregate environments, heightening the \npotential for COVID-19 to spread once introduced. \n•  In most cases, incarcerated/detained persons are not permitted to leave the facility. \n• There are many opportunities for COVID-19 to be introduced into a correctional or detention facility, including daily \nstaff ingress and egress; transfer of incarcerated/detained persons between facilities and systems, to court \nappearances, and to outside medical visits; and visits from family, legal representatives, and other community \nmembers. Some settings, particularly jails and detention centers, have high turnover, admitting new entrants daily \nwho may have been exposed to COVID-19 in the surrounding community or other regions. \n• Persons incarcerated/detained in a particular facility often come from a variety of locations, increasing the potential \nto introduce COVID-19 from different geographic areas. \n• Options for medical isolation of COVID-19 cases are limited and vary depending on the type and size of facility, as \nwell as the current level of available capacity, which is partly based on medical isolation needs for other conditions. \n•  Adequate levels of custody and healthcare staffing must be maintained to ensure safe operation of the facility, and \noptions to practice social distancing through work alternatives such as working from home or reduced/alternate \nschedules are limited for many staff roles. \n•  Correctional and detention facilities can be complex, multi-employer settings that include government and private \nemployers. Each is organizationally distinct and responsible for its own operational, personnel, and occupational \nhealth protocols and may be prohibited from issuing guidance or providing services to other employers or their staff \nwithin the same setting. Similarly, correctional and detention facilities may house individuals from multiple law \nenforcement agencies or jurisdictions subject to different policies and procedures. \n• Incarcerated/detained persons and staff may have medical conditions that increase their risk of severe disease from \nCOVID-19. \n•  Because limited outside information is available to many incarcerated/detained persons, unease and \nmisinformation regarding the potential for COVID-19 spread may be high, potentially creating security and morale \nchallenges. \n•  The ability of incarcerated/detained persons to exercise disease prevention measures (e.g., frequent handwashing) \nmay be limited and is determined by the supplies provided in the facility and by security considerations. Many \nfacilities restrict access to soap and paper towels and prohibit alcohol-based hand sanitizer and many disinfectants. \n•  Incarcerated persons may hesitate to report symptoms of COVID-19 or seek medical care due to co-pay \nrequirements and fear of isolation. \nCDC has issued separate COVID-19 guidance addressing healthcare infection control and clinical care of COVID-19 cases \nas well as close contacts of cases in community-based settings. Where relevant, community-focused guidance documents \nare referenced in this document and should be monitored regularly for updates, but they may require adaptation for \ncorrectional and detention settings. \nThis guidance document provides additional recommended best practices specifically for correctional and detention \nfacilities. At this time, different facility types (e.g., prison vs. jail) and sizes are not differentiated. \nAdministrators and agencies should adapt these guiding principles to the specific needs of their facility. \nWhat topics does this guidance include? \nThe guidance below includes detailed recommendations on the following topics related to COVID-19 in correctional and \ndetention settings: \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 2 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-3   Filed 04/08/20   Page 11 of 34   Page ID\n #:5408\n•  Operational and communications preparations for COVID-19 \n•  Enhanced cleaning/disinfecting and hygiene practices \n•  Social distancing strategies to increase space between individuals in the facility \n•  How to limit transmission from visitors \n• Infection control, including recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) and potential alternatives during \nPPE shortages \n•  Verbal screening and temperature check protocols for incoming incarcerated/detained individuals, staff, and visitors \n•  Medical isolation of confirmed and suspected cases and quarantine of contacts, including considerations for \ncohorting when individual spaces are limited \n•  Healthcare evaluation for suspected cases, including testing for COVID-19 \n• Clinical care for confirmed and suspected cases \n•  Considerations for persons at higher risk of severe disease from COVID-19 \nDefinitions of Commonly Used Terms \nClose contact of a COVID-19 case - In the context of COVID-19, an individual is considered a close contact if they a) \nhave been within approximately 6 feet of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time or b) have had direct contact \nwith infectious secretions from a COVID-19 case (e.g., have been coughed on). Close contact can occur while caring for, \nliving with, visiting, or sharing a common space with a COVID-19 case. Data to inform the definition of close contact are \nlimited. Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely \nincreases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure \nrisk, as does exposure to a severely ill patient). \nCohorting - Cohorting refers to the practice of isolating multiple laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases together as a \ngroup, or quarantining close contacts of a particular case together as a group. Ideally, cases should be isolated \nindividually, and close contacts should be quarantined individually. However, some correctional facilities and detention \ncenters do not have enough individual cells to do so and must consider cohorting as an alternative. See Quarantine and \nMedical Isolation sections below for specific details about ways to implement cohorting to minimize the risk of disease \nspread and adverse health outcomes. \nCommunity transmission of COVID-19 - Community transmission of COVID-19 occurs when individuals acquire the \ndisease through contact with someone in their local community, rather than through travel to an affected location. Once \ncommunity transmission is identified in a particular area, correctional facilities and detention centers are more likely to \nstart seeing cases inside their walls. Facilities should consult with local public health departments if assistance is needed \nin determining how to define \"local community\" in the context of COVID-19 spread. However, because all states have \nreported cases, all facilities should be vigilant for introduction into their populations. \nConfirmed vs. Suspected COVID-19 case - A confirmed case has received a positive result from a COVID-19 \nlaboratory test, with or without symptoms. A suspected case shows symptoms of COVID-19 but either has not been \ntested or is awaiting test results. If test results are positive, a suspected case becomes a confirmed case. \nIncarcerated/detained persons - For the purpose of this document, \"incarcerated/detained persons\" refers to persons \nheld in a prison, jail, detention center, or other custodial setting where these guidelines are generally applicable. The term \nincludes those who have been sentenced (i.e., in prisons) as well as those held for pre-trial (i.e., jails) or civil purposes (i.e, \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 3 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-3   Filed 04/08/20   Page 12 of 34   Page ID\n #:5409\ndetention centers). Although this guidance does not specifically reference individuals in every type of custodial setting \n(e.g., juvenile facilities, community confinement facilities), facility administrators can adapt this guidance to apply to their \nspecific circumstances as needed. \nMedical Isolation - Medical isolation refers to confining a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case (ideally to a single cell \nwith solid walls and a solid door that closes), to prevent contact with others and to reduce the risk of transmission. \nMedical isolation ends when the individual meets pre-established clinical and/or testing criteria for release from isolation, \nin consultation with clinical providers and public health officials (detailed in guidance below). In this context, isolation \ndoes NOT refer to punitive isolation for behavioral infractions within the custodial setting. Staff are encouraged to use the \nterm \"medical isolation\" to avoid confusion. \nQuarantine - Quarantine refers to the practice of confining individuals who have had close contact with a COVID-19 case \nto determine whether they develop symptoms of the disease. Quarantine for COVID-19 should last for a period of 14 \ndays. Ideally, each quarantined individual would be quarantined in a single cell with solid walls and a solid door that \ncloses. If symptoms develop during the 14-day period, the individual should be placed under medical isolation and \nevaluated for COVID-19. If symptoms do not develop, movement restrictions can be lifted, and the individual can return \nto their previous residency status within the facility. \nSocial Distancing - Social distancing is the practice of increasing the space between individuals and decreasing the \nfrequency of contact to reduce the risk of spreading a disease (ideally to maintain at least 6 feet between all individuals, \neven those who are asymptomatic). Social distancing strategies can be applied on an individual level (e.g., avoiding \nphysical contact), a group level (e.g., canceling group activities where individuals will be in close contact), and an \noperational level (e.g., rearranging chairs in the dining hall to increase distance between them). Although social distancing \nis challenging to practice in correctional and detention environments, it is a cornerstone of reducing transmission of \nrespiratory diseases such as COVID-19. Additional information about social distancing, including information on its use to \nreduce the spread of other viral illnesses, is available in this CDC publication El . \nStaff - In this document, \"staff\" refers to all public sector employees as well as those working for a private contractor \nwithin a correctional facility (e.g., private healthcare or food service). Except where noted, \"staff' does not distinguish \nbetween healthcare, custody, and other types of staff including private facility operators. \nSymptoms - Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Like other respiratory infections, \nCOVID-19 can vary in severity from mild to severe. When severe, pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death are possible. \nCOVID-19 is a novel disease, therefore the full range of signs and symptoms, the clinical course of the disease, and the \nindividuals and populations most at risk for disease and complications are not yet fully understood. Monitor the CDC \nwebsite for updates on these topics. \nFacilities with Limited Onsite Healthcare Services \nAlthough many large facilities such as prisons and some jails usually employ onsite healthcare staff and have the capacity \nto evaluate incarcerated/detained persons for potential illness within a dedicated healthcare space, many smaller \nfacilities do not. Some of these facilities have access to on-call healthcare staff or providers who visit the facility every few \ndays. Others have neither onsite healthcare capacity nor onsite medical isolation/quarantine space and must transfer ill \npatients to other correctional or detention facilities or local hospitals for evaluation and care. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 4 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-3   Filed 04/08/20   Page 13 of 34   Page ID\n #:5410\nThe majority of the guidance below is designed to be applied to any correctional or detention facility, either as written or \nwith modifications based on a facility's individual structure and resources. However, topics related to healthcare \nevaluation and clinical care of confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases and their close contacts may not apply directly to \nfacilities with limited or no onsite healthcare services. It will be especially important for these types of facilities to \ncoordinate closely with their state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health department when they encounter confirmed or \nsuspected cases among incarcerated/detained persons or staff, in order to ensure effective medical isolation and \nquarantine, necessary medical evaluation and care, and medical transfer if needed. The guidance makes note of \nstrategies tailored to facilities without onsite healthcare where possible. \nNote that all staff in any sized facility, regardless of the presence of onsite healthcare services, should observe guidance \non recommended PPE in order to ensure their own safety when interacting with confirmed and suspected COVID-19 \ncases. Facilities should make contingency plans for the likely event of PPE shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic. \nCOVID-19 Guidance for Correctional Facilities \nGuidance for correctional and detention facilities is organized into 3 sections: Operational Preparedness, Prevention, and \nManagement of COVID-19. Recommendations across these sections can be applied simultaneously based on the \nprogress of the outbreak in a particular facility and the surrounding community. \n•  Operational Preparedness. This guidance is intended to help facilities prepare for potential COVID-19 \ntransmission in the facility. Strategies focus on operational and communications planning and personnel practices. \n•  Prevention. This guidance is intended to help facilities prevent spread of COVID-19 from outside the facility to \ninside. Strategies focus on reinforcing hygiene practices, intensifying cleaning and disinfection of the facility, \nscreening (new intakes, visitors, and staff), continued communication with incarcerated/detained persons and staff, \nand social distancing measures (increasing distance between individuals). \n•  Management. This guidance is intended to help facilities clinically manage confirmed and suspected COVID-19 \ncases inside the facility and prevent further transmission. Strategies include medical isolation and care of \nincarcerated/detained persons with symptoms (including considerations for cohorting), quarantine of cases' close \ncontacts, restricting movement in and out of the facility, infection control practices for individuals interacting with \ncases and quarantined contacts or contaminated items, intensified social distancing, and cleaning and disinfecting \nareas visited by cases. \nOperational Preparedness \nAdministrators can plan and prepare for COVID-19 by ensuring that all persons in the facility know the symptoms of \nCOVID-19 and how to respond if they develop symptoms. Other essential actions include developing contingency plans \nfor reduced workforces due to absences, coordinating with public health and correctional partners, and communicating \nclearly with staff and incarcerated/detained persons about these preparations and how they may temporarily alter daily \nlife. \nCommunication & Coordination \n•  Develop information-sharing systems with partners. \no  Identify points of contact in relevant state, local, tribal, and/or territorial public health departments before \ncases develop. Actively engage with the health department to understand in advance which entity has \njurisdiction to implement public health control measures for COVID-19 in a particular correctional or detention \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 5 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-3   Filed 04/08/20   Page 14 of 34   Page ID\n #:5411\nfacility. \no  Create and test communications plans to disseminate critical information to incarcerated/detained persons, \nstaff, contractors, vendors, and visitors as the pandemic progresses. \no  Communicate with other correctional facilities in the same geographic area to share information including \ndisease surveillance and absenteeism patterns among staff. \no  Where possible, put plans in place with other jurisdictions to prevent confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases \nand their close contacts from being transferred between jurisdictions and facilities unless necessary for \nmedical evaluation, medical isolation/quarantine, clinical care, extenuating security concerns, or to prevent \novercrowding. \no  Stay informed about updates to CDC guidance via the CDC COVID-19 website as more information becomes \nknown. \n• Review existing pandemic flu, all-hazards, and disaster plans, and revise for COVID-19. \no  Ensure that physical locations (dedicated housing areas and bathrooms) have been identified to isolate \nconfirmed COVID-19 cases and individuals displaying COVID-19 symptoms, and to quarantine known close \ncontacts of cases. (Medical isolation and quarantine locations should be separate). The plan should include \ncontingencies for multiple locations if numerous cases and/or contacts are identified and require medical \nisolation or quarantine simultaneously. See Medical Isolation and Quarantine sections below for details \nregarding individual medical isolation and quarantine locations (preferred) vs. cohorting. \no  Facilities without onsite healthcare capacity should make a plan for how they will ensure that suspected COVID-\n19 cases will be isolated, evaluated, tested (if indicated), and provided necessary medical care. \no  Make a list of possible social distancing strategies that could be implemented as needed at different stages of \ntransmission intensity. \no  Designate officials who will be authorized to make decisions about escalating or de-escalating response efforts \nas the epidemiologic context changes. \n•  Coordinate with local law enforcement and court officials. \no  Identify lawful alternatives to in-person court appearances, such as virtual court, as a social distancing measure \nto reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. \no  Explore strategies to prevent over-crowding of correctional and detention facilities during a community \noutbreak. \n•  Post signage throughout the facility communicating the following: \no  For all: symptoms of COVID-19 and hand hygiene instructions \no  For incarcerated/detained persons: report symptoms to staff \no  For staff: stay at home when sick; if symptoms develop while on duty, leave the facility as soon as possible and \nfollow CDC-recommended steps for persons who are ill with COVID-19 symptoms including self-isolating at \nhome, contacting their healthcare provider as soon as possible to determine whether they need to be \nevaluated and tested, and contacting their supervisor. \no  Ensure that signage is understandable for non-English speaking persons and those with low literacy, and make \nnecessary accommodations for those with cognitive or intellectual disabilities and those who are deaf, blind, or \nlow-vision. \nPersonnel Practices \n•  Review the sick leave policies of each employer that operates in the facility. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 6 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-3   Filed 04/08/20   Page 15 of 34   Page ID\n #:5412\no  Review policies to ensure that they actively encourage staff to stay home when sick. \no  If these policies do not encourage staff to stay home when sick, discuss with the contract company. \no  Determine which officials will have the authority to send symptomatic staff home. \n• Identify staff whose duties would allow them to work from home. Where possible, allowing staff to work \nfrom home can be an effective social distancing strategy to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. \no  Discuss work from home options with these staff and determine whether they have the supplies and \ntechnological equipment required to do so. \no  put systems in place to implement work from home programs (e.g., time tracking, etc.). \n• Plan for staff absences. Staff should stay home when they are sick, or they may need to stay home to care for a \nsick household member or care for children in the event of school and childcare dismissals. \no  Allow staff to work from home when possible, within the scope of their duties. \no  Identify critical job functions and plan for alternative coverage by cross-training staff where possible. \no  Determine minimum levels of staff in all categories required for the facility to function safely. If possible, \ndevelop a plan to secure additional staff if absenteeism due to COVID-19 threatens to bring staffing to \nminimum levels. \no  Consider increasing keep on person (KOP) medication orders to cover 30 days in case of healthcare staff \nshortages. \n• Consider offering revised duties to staff who are at higher risk of severe illness with COVID-19. Persons \nat higher risk may include older adults and persons of any age with serious underlying medical conditions including \nlung disease, heart disease, and diabetes. See CDC's website for a complete list, and check regularly for updates as \nmore data become available to inform this issue. \no  Facility administrators should consult with their occupational health providers to determine whether it would \nbe allowable to reassign duties for specific staff members to reduce their likelihood of exposure to COVID-19. \n•  Offer the seasonal influenza vaccine to all incarcerated/detained persons (existing population and new \nintakes) and staff throughout the influenza season. Symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of influenza. \nPreventing influenza cases in a facility can speed the detection of COVID-19 cases and reduce pressure on \nhealthcare resources. \n•  Reference the Occupational Safety and Health Administration website Cl  for recommendations \nregarding worker health. \n•  Review CDC's guidance for businesses and employers to identify any additional strategies the facility can use \nwithin its role as an employer. \nOperations & Supplies \n•  Ensure that sufficient stocks of hygiene supplies, cleaning supplies, PPE, and medical supplies \n(consistent with the healthcare capabilities of the facility) are on hand and available, and have a plan in \nplace to restock as needed if COVID-19 transmission occurs within the facility. \no  Standard medical supplies for daily clinic needs \no  Tissues \no  Liquid soap when possible. If bar soap must be used, ensure that it does not irritate the skin and thereby \nhttps://viww.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-cietention/guidance-correctional-cietention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 7 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-3   Filed 04/08/20   Page 16 of 34   Page ID\n #:5413\ndiscourage frequent hand washing. \no  Hand drying supplies \no  Alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol (where permissible based on security restrictions) \no  Cleaning supplies, including EPA-registered disinfectants effective against the virus that causes COVID-19 El \no  Recommended PPE (facemasks, N95 respirators, eye protection, disposable medical gloves, and disposable \ngowns/one-piece coveralls). See PPE section and Table 1 for more detailed information, including \nrecommendations for extending the life of all PPE categories in the event of shortages, and when face masks \nare acceptable alternatives to N95s. Visit CDC's website for a calculator to help determine rate of PPE usage. \no  Sterile viral transport media and sterile swabs to collect nasopharyngeal specimens if COVID-19 testing is \nindicated \n•  Make contingency plans for the probable event of PPE shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic, \nparticularly for non-healthcare workers. \no  See CDC guidance optimizing PPE supplies. \n•  Consider relaxing restrictions on allowing alcohol-based hand sanitizer in the secure setting where \nsecurity concerns allow. If soap and water are not available, CDC recommends cleaning hands with an alcohol-\nbased hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Consider allowing staff to carry individual-sized bottles for \ntheir personal hand hygiene while on duty. \n•  Provide a no-cost supply of soap to incarcerated/detained persons, sufficient to allow frequent_ hand \nwashing. (See Hygiene section below for additional detail regarding recommended frequency and protocol for hand \nwashing.) \no  Provide liquid soap where possible. If bar soap must be used, ensure that it does not irritate the skin and \nthereby discourage frequent hand washing. \n•  If not already in place, employers operating within the facility should establish a respiratory protection \nprogram as appropriate, to ensure that staff and incarcerated/detained persons are fit tested for any \nrespiratory protection they will need within the scope of their responsibilities. \n•  Ensure that staff and incarcerated/detained persons are trained to correctly don, doff, and dispose of \nPPE that they will need to use within the scope of their responsibilities. See Table 1 for recommended PPE \nfor incarcerated/detained persons and staff with varying levels of contact with COVID-19 cases or their close \ncontacts. \nPrevention \nCases of COVID-19 have been documented in all 50 US states. Correctional and detention facilities can prevent \nintroduction of COVID-19 from the community and reduce transmission if it is already inside by reinforcing good hygiene \npractices among incarcerated/detained persons, staff, and visitors (including increasing access to soap and paper towels), \nintensifying cleaning/disinfection practices, and implementing social distancing strategies. \nBecause many individuals infected with COVID-19 do not display symptoms, the virus could be present in facilities before \ncases are identified. Both good hygiene practices and social distancing are critical in preventing further transmission. \nOperations \nhttps://www.ccic.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 8 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-3   Filed 04/08/20   Page 17 of 34   Page ID\n #:5414\n• Stay in communication with partners about your facility's current situation. \no  State, local, territorial, and/or tribal health departments \no  Other correctional facilities \n• Communicate with the public about any changes to facility operations, including visitation programs. \n• Restrict transfers of incarcerated/detained persons to and from other jurisdictions and facilities unless \nnecessary for medical evaluation, medical isolation/quarantine, clinical care, extenuating security \nconcerns, or to prevent overcrowding. \no  Strongly consider postponing non-urgent outside medical visits. \no  If a transfer is absolutely necessary, perform verbal screening and a temperature check as outlined in the \nScreening section below, before the individual leaves the facility. If an individual does not clear the screening \nprocess, delay the transfer and follow the protocol for a suspected COVID-19 case - including putting a face \nmask on the individual, immediately placing them under medical isolation, and evaluating them for possible \nCOVID-19 testing. If the transfer must still occur, ensure that the receiving facility has capacity to properly \nisolate the individual upon arrival. Ensure that staff transporting the individual wear recommended PPE (see \nTable 1) and that the transport vehicle is cleaned thoroughly after transport. \n• Implement lawful alternatives to in-person court appearances where permissible. \n•  Where relevant, consider suspending co-pays for incarcerated/detained persons seeking medical \nevaluation for respiratory symptoms. \n•  Limit the number of operational entrances and exits to the facility. \nCleaning and Disinfecting Practices \n•  Even if COVID-19 cases have not yet been identified inside the facility or in the surrounding community, \nbegin implementing intensified cleaning and disinfecting procedures according to the \nrecommendations below. These measures may prevent spread of COVID-19 if introduced. \n•  Adhere to CDC recommendations for cleaning and disinfection during the COVID-19 response. Monitor \nthese recommendations for updates. \no  several times per day, clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that are frequently touched, especially in \ncommon areas. Such surfaces may include objects/surfaces not ordinarily cleaned daily (e.g., doorknobs, light \nswitches, sink handles, countertops, toilets, toilet handles, recreation equipment, kiosks, and telephones). \no  Staff should clean shared equipment several times per day and on a conclusion of use basis (e.g., radios, \nservice weapons, keys, handcuffs). \no  Use household cleaners and EPA-registered disinfectants effective against the virus that causes COVID-19 Cl \nas appropriate for the surface, following label instructions. This may require lifting restrictions on undiluted \ndisinfectants. \no  Labels contain instructions for safe and effective use of the cleaning product, including precautions that should \nbe taken when applying the product, such as wearing gloves and making sure there is good ventilation during \nuse \n•  Consider increasing the number of staff and/or incarcerated/detained persons trained and responsible \nfor cleaning common areas to ensure continual cleaning of these areas throughout the day. \n•  Ensure adequate supplies to support intensified cleaning and disinfection practices, and have a plan in \nplace to restock rapidly if needed. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 9 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-3   Filed 04/08/20   Page 18 of 34   Page ID\n #:5415\nHygiene \n• Reinforce healthy hygiene practices, and provide and continually restock hygiene supplies throughout \nthe facility, including in bathrooms, food preparation and dining areas, intake areas, visitor entries and \nexits, visitation rooms and waiting rooms, common areas, medical, and staff-restricted areas (e.g., \nbreak rooms). \n• Encourage all persons in the facility to take the following actions to protect themselves and others from \nCOVID-19. Post signage throughout the facility, and communicate this information verbally on a regular \nbasis. Sample signage and other communications materials are available on the CDC website. Ensure \nthat materials can be understood by non-English speakers and those with low literacy, and make necessary \naccommodations for those with cognitive or intellectual disabilities and those who are deaf, blind, or low-vision. \no  Practice good cough etiquette: Cover your mouth and nose with your elbow (or ideally with a tissue) rather \nthan with your hand when you cough or sneeze, and throw all tissues in the trash immediately after use. \no  Practice good hand hygiene: Regularly wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, \nespecially after coughing, sneezing, or blowing your nose; after using the bathroom; before eating or preparing \nfood; before taking medication; and after touching garbage. \no  Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth without cleaning your hands first. \no  Avoid sharing eating utensils, dishes, and cups. \no  Avoid non-essential physical contact. \n•  Provide incarcerated/detained persons and staff no-cost access to: \no  Soap - Provide liquid soap where possible. If bar soap must be used, ensure that it does not irritate the skin, as \nthis would discourage frequent hand washing. \no  Running water, and hand drying machines or disposable paper towels for hand washing \no  Tissues and no-touch trash receptacles for disposal \n•  Provide alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol where permissible based on security \nrestrictions. Consider allowing staff to carry individual-sized bottles to maintain hand hygiene. \n•  Communicate that sharing drugs and drug preparation equipment can spread COVID-19 due to \npotential contamination of shared items and close contact between individuals. \nPrevention Practices for Incarcerated/Detained Persons \n•  Perform pre-intake screening and temperature checks for all new entrants. Screening should take place \nin the sallyport, before beginning the intake process, in order to identify and immediately place individuals \nwith symptoms under medical isolation. See Screening section below for the wording of screening questions and a \nrecommended procedure to safely perform a temperature check. Staff performing temperature checks should wear \nrecommended PPE (see PPE section below). \no  If an individual has symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough, shortness of breath): \n■  Require the individual to wear a face mask. \n■  Ensure that staff who have direct contact with the symptomatic individual wear recommended PPE. \n■  Place the individual under medical isolation (ideally in a room near the screening location, rather than \ntransporting the ill individual through the facility), and refer to healthcare staff for further evaluation. (See \nInfection Control and Clinical Care sections below.) \n■  Facilities without onsite healthcare staff should contact their state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health \nhttps://vvviw.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 10 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-3   Filed 04/08/20   Page 19 of 34   Page ID\n #:5416\ndepartment to coordinate effective medical isolation and necessary medical care. \no  If an individual is a close contact of a known COVID-19 case (but has no COVID-19 symptoms): \n•  Quarantine the individual and monitor for symptoms two times per day for 14 days. (See Quarantine \nsection below.) \n■  Facilities without onsite healthcare staff should contact their state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health \ndepartment to coordinate effective quarantine and necessary medical care. \n• Implement social distancing strategies to increase the physical space between incarcerated/detained \npersons (ideally 6 feet between all individuals, regardless of the presence of symptoms). Strategies will \nneed to be tailored to the individual space in the facility and the needs of the population and staff. Not all strategies \nwill be feasible in all facilities. Example strategies with varying levels of intensity include: \no  Common areas: \n■  Enforce increased space between individuals in holding cells, as well as in lines and waiting areas such as \nintake (e.g., remove every other chair in a waiting area) \no  Recreation: \n■  Choose recreation spaces where individuals can spread out \n■  Stagger time in recreation spaces \n■  Restrict recreation space usage to a single housing unit per space \n(where feasible) \no  Meals: \n■  Stagger meals \n•  Rearrange seating in the dining hall so that there is more space between individuals (e.g., remove every \nother chair and use only one side of the table) \n■  Provide meals inside housing units or cells \no  Group activities: \n•  Limit the size of group activities \n•  Increase space between individuals during group activities \n■  Suspend group programs where participants are likely to be in closer contact than they are in their \nhousing environment \n■  Consider alternatives to existing group activities, in outdoor areas or other areas where individuals can \nspread out \no  Housing: \n■  If space allows, reassign bunks to provide more space between individuals, ideally 6 feet or more in all \ndirections. (Ensure that bunks are cleaned thoroughly if assigned to a new occupant.) \n■  Arrange bunks so that individuals sleep head to foot to increase the distance between them \n■  Rearrange scheduled movements to minimize mixing of individuals from different housing areas \no  Medical: \n■  If possible, designate a room near each housing unit to evaluate individuals with COVID-19 symptoms, \nrather than having them walk through the facility to be evaluated in the medical unit. If this is not feasible, \nconsider staggering sick call. \n■  Designate a room near the intake area to evaluate new entrants who are flagged by the intake screening \nprocess for COVID-19 symptoms or case contact, before they move to other parts of the facility. \n•  Communicate clearly and frequently with incarcerated/detained persons about changes to their daily \nroutine and how they can contribute to risk reduction. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 11 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-3   Filed 04/08/20   Page 20 of 34   Page ID\n #:5417\n• Note that if group activities are discontinued, it will be important to identify alternative forms of \nactivity to support the mental health of incarcerated/detained persons. \n• Consider suspending work release programs and other programs that involve movement of \nincarcerated/detained individuals in and out of the facility. \n• Provide up-to-date information about COVID-19 to incarcerated/detained persons on a regular basis, \nincluding: \no  Symptoms of COVID-19 and its health risks \no  Reminders to report COVID-19 symptoms to staff at the first sign of illness \n• Consider having healthcare staff perform rounds on a regular basis to answer questions about COVID-\n19. \nPrevention Practices for Staff \n•  Remind staff to stay at home if they are sick. Ensure that staff are aware that they will not be able to enter the \nfacility if they have symptoms of COVID-19, and that they will be expected to leave the facility as soon as possible if \nthey develop symptoms while on duty. \n•  Perform verbal screening (for COVID-19 symptoms and close contact with cases) and temperature \nchecks for all staff daily on entry. See Screening section below for wording of screening questions and a \nrecommended procedure to safely perform temperature checks. \no  In very small facilities with only a few staff, consider self-monitoring or virtual monitoring (e.g., reporting to a \ncentral authority via phone). \no  Send staff home who do not clear the screening process, and advise them to follow CDC-recommended steps \nfor persons who are ill with COVID-19 symptoms. \n• Provide staff with up-to-date information about COVID-19 and about facility policies on a regular basis, \nincluding: \no  symptoms of COVID-19 and its health risks \no  Employers' sick leave policy \no  If staff develop a fever, cough, or shortness of breath while at work: immediately put on a face mask, \ninform supervisor, leave the facility, and follow CDC-recommended steps for persons who are ill with COVID-19 \nsymptoms. \no  If staff test positive for COVID-19: inform workplace and personal contacts immediately, and do not return \nto work until a decision to discontinue home medical isolation precautions is made. Monitor CDC guidance on \ndiscontinuing home isolation regularly as circumstances evolve rapidly. \no  If a staff member is identified as a close contact of a COVID-19 case (either within the facility or in \nthe community): self-quarantine at home for 14 days and return to work if symptoms do not develop. If \nsymptoms do develop, follow CDC-recommended steps for persons who are ill with COVID-19 symptoms. \n• If a staff member has a confirmed COVID-19 infection, the relevant employers should inform other staff \nabout their possible exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace, but should maintain confidentiality as \nrequired by the Americans with Disabilities Act. \no  Employees who are close contacts of the case should then self-monitor for symptoms (i.e., fever, cough, or \nshortness of breath). \n•  When feasible and consistent with security priorities, encourage staff to maintain a distance of 6 feet or \nmore from an individual with respiratory symptoms while interviewing, escorting, or interacting in \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 12 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-3   Filed 04/08/20   Page 21 of 34   Page ID\n #:5418\nother ways. \n• Ask staff to keep interactions with individuals with respiratory symptoms as brief as possible. \nPrevention Practices for Visitors \n• If possible, communicate with potential visitors to discourage contact visits in the interest of their own \nhealth and the health of their family members and friends inside the facility. \n• Perform verbal screening (for COVID-19 symptoms and close contact with cases) and temperature \nchecks for all visitors and volunteers on entry. See Screening section below for wording of screening questions \nand a recommended procedure to safely perform temperature checks. \no  Staff performing temperature checks should wear recommended PPE. \no  Exclude visitors and volunteers who do not clear the screening process or who decline screening. \n•  Provide alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol in visitor entrances, exits, and waiting \nareas. \n•  Provide visitors and volunteers with information to prepare them for screening. \no  Instruct visitors to postpone their visit if they have symptoms of respiratory illness. \no  If possible, inform potential visitors and volunteers before they travel to the facility that they should expect to \nbe screened for COVID-19 (including a temperature check), and will be unable to enter the facility if they do not \nclear the screening process or if they decline screening. \no  Display signage outside visiting areas explaining the COVID-19 screening and temperature check process. \nEnsure that materials are understandable for non-English speakers and those with low literacy. \n• Promote non-contact visits: \no  Encourage incarcerated/detained persons to limit contact visits in the interest of their own health and the \nhealth of their visitors. \no  Consider reducing or temporarily eliminating the cost of phone calls for incarcerated/detained persons. \no  Consider increasing incarcerated/detained persons' telephone privileges to promote mental health and reduce \nexposure from direct contact with community visitors. \n•  Consider suspending or modifying visitation programs, if legally permissible. For example, provide \naccess to virtual visitation options where available. \no  If moving to virtual visitation, clean electronic surfaces regularly. (See Cleaning guidance below for instructions \non cleaning electronic surfaces.) \no  Inform potential visitors of changes to, or suspension of, visitation programs. \no  Clearly communicate any visitation program changes to incarcerated/detained persons, along with the reasons \nfor them (including protecting their health and their family and community members' health). \no  If suspending contact visits, provide alternate means (e.g., phone or video visitation) for incarcerated/detained \nindividuals to engage with legal representatives, clergy, and other individuals with whom they have legal right \nto consult. \nNOTE: Suspending visitation would be done in the interest of incarcerated/detained persons' physical health and the \nhealth of the general public. However, visitation is important to maintain mental health. If visitation is suspended, \nfacilities should explore alternative ways for incarcerated/detained persons to communicate with their families, friends, \nand other visitors in a way that is not financially burdensome for them. See above suggestions for promoting non-contact \nvisits. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 13 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-3   Filed 04/08/20   Page 22 of 34   Page ID\n #:5419\n•  Restrict non-essential vendors, volunteers, and tours from entering the facility. \nManagement \nIf there has been a suspected COVID-19 case inside the facility (among incarcerated/detained persons, staff, or visitors \nwho have recently been inside), begin implementing Management strategies while test results are pending. Essential \nManagement strategies include placing cases and individuals with symptoms under medical isolation, quarantining their \nclose contacts, and facilitating necessary medical care, while observing relevant infection control and environmental \ndisinfection protocols and wearing recommended PPE. \nOperations \n•  Implement alternate work arrangements deemed feasible in the Operational Preparedness \n•  Suspend all transfers of incarcerated/detained persons to and from other jurisdictions and facilities \n(including work release where relevant), unless necessary for medical evaluation, medical \nisolation/quarantine, care, extenuating security concerns, or to prevent overcrowding. \no  If a transfer is absolutely necessary, perform verbal screening and a temperature check as outlined in the \nScreening section below, before the individual leaves the facility. If an individual does not clear the screening \nprocess, delay the transfer and follow the protocol for a suspected COVID-19 case - including putting a face \nmask on the individual, immediately placing them under medical isolation, and evaluating them for possible \nCOVID-19 testing. If the transfer must still occur, ensure that the receiving facility has capacity to appropriately \nisolate the individual upon arrival. Ensure that staff transporting the individual wear recommended PPE (see \nTable 1) and that the transport vehicle is cleaned thoroughly after transport. \n•  If possible, consider quarantining all new intakes for 14 days before they enter the facility's general \npopulation (SEPARATELY from other individuals who are quarantined due to contact with a COVID-19 \ncase). Subsequently in this document, this practice is referred to as routine intake quarantine. \n•  When possible, arrange lawful alternatives to in-person court appearances. \n•  Incorporate screening for COVID-19 symptoms and a temperature check into release planning. \no  Screen all releasing individuals for COVID-19 symptoms and perform a temperature check. (See Screening \nsection below.) \n■ If an individual does not clear the screening process, follow the protocol for a suspected COVID-19 case \nincluding putting a face mask on the individual, immediately placing them under medical isolation, and \nevaluating them for possible COVID-19 testing. \n■ If the individual is released before the recommended medical isolation period is complete, discuss release \nof the individual with state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health departments to ensure safe medical \ntransport and continued shelter and medical care, as part of release planning. Make direct linkages to \ncommunity resources to ensure proper medical isolation and access to medical care. \n■ Before releasing an incarcerated/detained individual with COVID-19 symptoms to a community-based \nfacility, such as a homeless shelter, contact the facility's staff to ensure adequate time for them to prepare \nto continue medical isolation, or contact local public health to explore alternate housing options. \n•  Coordinate with state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health departments. \no  when a COVID-19 case is suspected, work with public health to determine action. See Medical Isolation section \nbelow. \no  When a COVID-19 case is suspected or confirmed, work with public health to identify close contacts who should \nbe placed under quarantine. See Quarantine section below. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 14 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-3   Filed 04/08/20   Page 23 of 34   Page ID\n #:5420\no  Facilities with limited onsite medical isolation, quarantine, and/or healthcare services should coordinate closely \nwith state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health departments when they encounter a confirmed or suspected \ncase, in order to ensure effective medical isolation or quarantine, necessary medical evaluation and care, and \nmedical transfer if needed. See Facilities with Limited Onsite Healthcare Services section. \nHygiene \n• Continue to ensure that hand hygiene supplies are well-stocked in all areas of the facility. (See above.) \n•  Continue to emphasize practicing good hand hygiene and cough etiquette. (See above.) \nCleaning and Disinfecting Practices \n•  Continue adhering to recommended cleaning and disinfection procedures for the facility at large. (See \nabove.) \n•  Reference specific cleaning and disinfection procedures for areas where a COVID-19 case has spent \ntime (below). \nMedical Isolation of Confirmed or Suspected COVID-19 Cases \nNOTE: Some recommendations below apply primarily to facilities with onsite healthcare capacity. Facilities \nwithout onsite healthcare capacity, or without sufficient space to implement effective medical isolation, \nshould coordinate with local public health officials to ensure that COVID-19 cases will be appropriately \nisolated, evaluated, tested (if indicated), and given care. \n•  As soon as an individual develops symptoms of COVID-19, they should wear a face mask (if it does not \nrestrict breathing) and should be immediately placed under medical isolation in a separate \nenvironment from other individuals. \n•  Keep the individual's movement outside the medical isolation space to an absolute minimum. \no  Provide medical care to cases inside the medical isolation space. See Infection Control and Clinical Care \nsections for additional details. \nServe meals to cases inside the medical isolation space. \no \nExclude the individual from all group activities. \no \no  Assign the isolated individual a dedicated bathroom when possible. \n•  Ensure that the individual is wearing a face mask at all times when outside of the medical isolation \nspace, and whenever another individual enters. Provide clean masks as needed. Masks should be changed at \nleast daily, and when visibly soiled or wet. \n•  Facilities should make every possible effort to place suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases under \nmedical isolation individually. Each isolated individual should be assigned their own housing space and \nbathroom where possible. Cohorting should only be practiced if there are no other available options. \no  If cohorting is necessary: \ns  Only individuals who are laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases should be placed under \nmedical isolation as a cohort. Do not cohort confirmed cases with suspected cases or case \ncontacts. \n■  Unless no other options exist, do not house COVID-19 cases with individuals who have an undiagnosed \nrespiratory infection. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.htrn1  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 15 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-3   Filed 04/08/20   Page 24 of 34   Page ID\n #:5421\n■ Ensure that cohorted cases wear face masks at all times. \no  In order of preference, individuals under medical isolation should be housed: \n■  Separately, in single cells with solid walls (i.e., not bars) and solid doors that close fully \n■  Separately, in single cells with solid walls but without solid doors \n■ As a cohort, in a large, well-ventilated cell with solid walls and a solid door that closes fully.

Employ social distancing strategies related to \nhousing in the Prevention section above. \n■ Safely transfer individual(s) to another facility with available medical isolation capacity in one of the above \narrangements \n(NOTE - Transfer should be avoided due to the potential to introduce infection to another facility; proceed \nonly if no other options are available.) \nIf the ideal choice does not exist in a facility, use the next best alternative. \n•  If the number of confirmed cases exceeds the number of individual medical isolation spaces available \nin the facility, be especially mindful of cases who are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. \nIdeally, they should not be cohorted with other infected individuals. If cohorting is unavoidable, make all possible \naccommodations to prevent transmission of other infectious diseases to the higher-risk individual. (For example, \nallocate more space for a higher-risk individual within a shared medical isolation space.) \no  persons at higher risk may include older adults and persons of any age with serious underlying medical \nconditions such as lung disease, heart disease, and diabetes. See CDC's website for a complete list, and check \nregularly for updates as more data become available to inform this issue. \no  Note that incarcerated/detained populations have higher prevalence of infectious and chronic diseases and are \nin poorer health than the general population, even at younger ages. \n•  Custody staff should be designated to monitor these individuals exclusively where possible. These staff \nshould wear recommended PPE as appropriate for their level of contact with the individual under medical isolation \n(see PPE section below) and should limit their own movement between different parts of the facility to the extent \npossible. \n•  Minimize transfer of COVID-19 cases between spaces within the healthcare unit. \n•  Provide individuals under medical isolation with tissues and, if permissible, a lined no-touch trash \nreceptacle. Instruct them to: \no  cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when they cough or sneeze \no  Dispose of used tissues immediately in the lined trash receptacle \no  Wash hands immediately with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, \nclean hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol (where security concerns \npermit). Ensure that hand washing supplies are continually restocked. \n•  Maintain medical isolation until all the following criteria have been met.

Refer to the Definitions \nsection for the distinction between confirmed and suspected cases. \no  Close off areas used by the infected individual. If possible, open outside doors and windows to increase air \ncirculation in the area. Wait as long as practical, up to 24 hours under the poorest air exchange conditions \n(consult CDC Guidelines for Environmental Infection Control in Health-Care Facilities for wait time based on \ndifferent ventilation conditions), before beginning to clean and disinfect, to minimize potential for exposure to \nrespiratory droplets. \no  Clean and disinfect all areas (e.g., cells, bathrooms, and common areas) used by the infected individual, \nfocusing especially on frequently touched surfaces (see list above in Prevention section). \n•  Hard (non-porous) surface cleaning and disinfection \no  If surfaces are dirty, they should be cleaned using a detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection. \no  For disinfection, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants should be effective. Choose cleaning \nproducts based on security requirements within the facility. \n■  Consult a list of products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19 E  . Follow \nthe manufacturer's instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application \nmethod and contact time, etc.). \n■  Diluted household bleach solutions can be used if appropriate for the surface.

Prepare a bleach solution by mixing: \nn  5 tablespoons (1/3rd cup) bleach per gallon of water or \n•  4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water \n• Soft (porous) surface cleaning and disinfection \no  For soft (porous) surfaces such as carpeted floors and rugs, remove visible contamination if present and clean \nwith appropriate cleaners indicated for use on these surfaces. After cleaning: \n•  If the items can be laundered, launder items in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions using the \nwarmest appropriate water setting for the items and then dry items completely. \n•  Otherwise, use products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19 Ell  and are \nsuitable for porous surfaces. \n• Electronics cleaning and disinfection \no  For electronics such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, and remote controls, remove visible contamination if \npresent. \n•  Follow the manufacturer's instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products. \n•  Consider use of wipeable covers for electronics. \n•  If no manufacturer guidance is available, consider the use of alcohol-based wipes or spray containing at \nleast 70% alcohol to disinfect touch screens. Dry surfaces thoroughly to avoid pooling of liquids. \nAdditional information on cleaning and disinfection of communal facilities such can be found on CDC's website. \n•  Ensure that staff and incarcerated/detained persons performing cleaning wear recommended PPE. (See \nPPE section below.) \n•  Food service items. Cases under medical isolation should throw disposable food service items in the trash in their \nmedical isolation room. Non-disposable food service items should be handled with gloves and washed with hot \nwater or in a dishwasher. Individuals handling used food service items should clean their hands after removing \ngloves. \n•  Laundry from a COVID-19 cases can be washed with other individuals' laundry. \no  Individuals handling laundry from COVID-19 cases should wear disposable gloves, discard after each use, and \nclean their hands after. \no  Do not shake dirty laundry. This will minimize the possibility of dispersing virus through the air. \no  Launder items as appropriate in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. If possible, launder items \nusing the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely. \no  Clean and disinfect clothes hampers according to guidance above for surfaces. If permissible, consider using a \nbag liner that is either disposable or can be laundered. \n• Consult cleaning recommendations above to ensure that transport vehicles are thoroughly cleaned \nafter carrying a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case. \nQuarantining Close Contacts of COVID-19 Cases \nNOTE: Some recommendations below apply primarily to facilities with onsite healthcare capacity. Facilities \nwithout onsite healthcare capacity, or without sufficient space to implement effective quarantine, should \ncoordinate with local public health officials to ensure that close contacts of COVID-19 cases will be \neffectively quarantined and medically monitored. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 18 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-3   Filed 04/08/20   Page 27 of 34   Page ID\n #:5424\n• Incarcerated/detained persons who are close contacts of a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case \n(whether the case is another incarcerated/detained person, staff member, or visitor) should be placed \nunder quarantine for 14 days (see CDC guidelines). \no  If an individual is quarantined due to contact with a suspected case who is subsequently tested for COVID-19 \nand receives a negative result, the quarantined individual should be released from quarantine restrictions. \n• In the context of COVID-19, an individual (incarcerated/detained person or staff) is considered a close \ncontact if they: \no  Have been within approximately 6 feet of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time OR \no  Have had direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g., have been coughed on) \nClose contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a common space with a COVID-19 case. Data to \ninform the definition of close contact are limited. Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of \nexposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-\n19 (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure risk, as does exposure to a severely ill patient). \n•  Keep a quarantined individual's movement outside the quarantine space to an absolute minimum. \no  Provide medical evaluation and care inside or near the quarantine space when possible. \no  Serve meals inside the quarantine space. \no  Exclude the quarantined individual from all group activities. \no  Assign the quarantined individual a dedicated bathroom when possible. \n•  Facilities should make every possible effort to quarantine close contacts of COVID-19 cases individually. \nCohorting multiple quarantined close contacts of a COVID-19 case could transmit COVID-19 from those who are \ninfected to those who are uninfected. Cohorting should only be practiced if there are no other available options. \no  If cohorting of close contacts under quarantine is absolutely necessary, symptoms of all individuals should be \nmonitored closely, and individuals with symptoms of COVID-19 should be placed under medical isolation \no  If an entire housing unit is under quarantine due to contact with a case from the same housing unit, the entire \nhousing unit may need to be treated as a cohort and quarantine in place. \no  some facilities may choose to quarantine all new intakes for 14 days before moving them to the facility's \ngeneral population as a general rule (not because they were exposed to a COVID-19 case). Under this scenario, \navoid mixing individuals quarantined due to exposure to a COVID-19 case with individuals undergoing routine \nintake quarantine. \no  If at all possible, do not add more individuals to an existing quarantine cohort after the 14-day quarantine clock \nhas started. \n•  If the number of quarantined individuals exceeds the number of individual quarantine spaces available \nin the facility, be especially mindful of those who are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. \nIdeally, they should not be cohorted with other quarantined individuals. If cohorting is unavoidable, make all \npossible accommodations to reduce exposure risk for the higher-risk individuals.

Facilities \nwithout onsite healthcare capacity or without sufficient space for medical isolation should coordinate with \nlocal public health officials to ensure that suspected COVID-19 cases will be effectively isolated, evaluated, \ntested (if indicated), and given care._ \n• If possible, designate a room near each housing unit for healthcare staff to evaluate individuals with \nCOVID-19 symptoms, rather than having them walk through the facility to be evaluated in the medical \nunit. \n• Incarcerated/detained individuals with COVID-19 symptoms should wear a face mask and should be \nplaced under medical isolation immediately. Discontinue the use of a face mask if it inhibits breathing. \nSee Medical Isolation section above. \n• Medical staff should evaluate symptomatic individuals to determine whether COVID-19 testing is \nindicated. Refer to CDC guidelines for information on evaluation and testing. See Infection Control and Clinical Care \nsections below as well. \n• If testing is indicated (or if medical staff need clarification on when testing is indicated), contact the \nstate, local, tribal, and/or territorial health department. Work with public health or private labs as \navailable to access testing supplies or services. \no  If the COVID-19 test is positive, continue medical isolation. (See Medical Isolation section above.) \no  If the COVID-19 test is negative, return the individual to their prior housing assignment unless they require \nfurther medical assessment or care. \nManagement Strategies for Incarcerated/Detained Persons without \nCOVID-19 Symptoms \n•  Provide clear information to incarcerated/detained persons about the presence of COVID-19 cases \nwithin the facility, and the need to increase social distancing and maintain hygiene precautions. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 21 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-3   Filed 04/08/20   Page 30 of 34   Page ID\n #:5427\no  Consider having healthcare staff perform regular rounds to answer questions about COVID-19. \no  Ensure that information is provided in a manner that can be understood by non-English speaking individuals \nand those with low literacy, and make necessary accommodations for those with cognitive or intellectual \ndisabilities and those who are deaf, blind, or low-vision. \n• Implement daily temperature checks in housing units where COVID-19 cases have been identified, \nespecially if there is concern that incarcerated/detained individuals are not notifying staff of \nsymptoms.See Screening section for a procedure to safely perform a temperature check. \n• Consider additional options to intensify social distancing within the facility. \nManagement Strategies for Staff \n• Provide clear information to staff about the presence of COVID-19 cases within the facility, and the \nneed to enforce social distancing and encourage hygiene precautions. \no  Consider having healthcare staff perform regular rounds to answer questions about COVID-19 from staff. \n• Staff identified as close contacts of a COVID-19 case should self-quarantine at home for 14 days and \nmay return to work if symptoms do not develop. \no  See above for definition of a close contact. \no  Refer to CDC guidelines for further recommendations regarding home quarantine for staff. \nInfection Control \nInfection control guidance below is applicable to all types of correctional facilities. Individual facilities \nshould assess their unique needs based on the types of exposure staff and incarcerated/detained persons \nmay have with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases. \n•  All individuals who have the potential for direct or indirect exposure to COVID-19 cases or infectious \nmaterials (including body substances; contaminated medical supplies, devices, and equipment; \ncontaminated environmental surfaces; or contaminated air) should follow infection control practices \noutlined in the CDC Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with \nSuspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings. Monitor these \nguidelines regularly for updates. \no  Implement the above guidance as fully as possible within the correctional/detention context. Some of the \nspecific language may not apply directly to healthcare settings within correctional facilities and detention \ncenters, or to facilities without onsite healthcare capacity, and may need to be adapted to reflect facility \noperations and custody needs. \no  Note that these recommendations apply to staff as well as to incarcerated/detained individuals who may come \nin contact with contaminated materials during the course of their work placement in the facility (e.g., cleaning). \n•  Staff should exercise caution when in contact with individuals showing symptoms of a respiratory \ninfection. Contact should be minimized to the extent possible until the infected individual is wearing a face mask. If \nCOVID-19 is suspected, staff should wear recommended PPE (see PPE section). \n•  Refer to PPE section to determine recommended PPE for individuals persons in contact with confirmed \nCOVID-19 cases, contacts, and potentially contaminated items. \nClinical Care of COVID-19 Cases \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-cietention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 22 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-3   Filed 04/08/20   Page 31 of 34   Page ID\n #:5428\n•  Facilities should ensure that incarcerated/detained individuals receive medical evaluation and \ntreatment at the first signs of COVID-19 symptoms. \no  If a facility is not able to provide such evaluation and treatment, a plan should be in place to safely transfer the \nindividual to another facility or local hospital. \no  The initial medical evaluation should determine whether a symptomatic individual is at higher risk for severe \nillness from COVID-19. Persons at higher risk may include older adults and persons of any age with serious \nunderlying medical conditions such as lung disease, heart disease, and diabetes. See CDC's website for a \ncomplete list, and check regularly for updates as more data become available to inform this issue. \n• Staff evaluating and providing care for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases should follow the CDC \nInterim Clinical Guidance for Management of Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) \nand monitor the guidance website regularly for updates to these recommendations. \n•  Healthcare staff should evaluate persons with respiratory symptoms or contact with a COVID-19 case in \na separate room, with the door closed if possible, while wearing recommended PPE and ensuring that \nthe suspected case is wearing a face mask. \no  If possible, designate a room near each housing unit to evaluate individuals with COVID-19 symptoms, rather \nthan having them walk through the facility to be evaluated in the medical unit. \nClinicians are strongly encouraged to test for other causes of respiratory illness (e.g., influenza). \nG \n•  The facility should have a plan in place to safely transfer persons with severe illness from COVID-19 to \na local hospital if they require care beyond what the facility is able to provide. \n•  When evaluating and treating persons with symptoms of COVID-19 who do not speak English, using a \nlanguage line or provide a trained interpreter when possible. \nRecommended PPE and PPE Training for Staff and \nIncarcerated/Detained Persons \n•  Ensure that all staff (healthcare and non-healthcare) and incarcerated/detained persons who will have \ncontact with infectious materials in their work placements have been trained to correctly don, doff, and \ndispose of PPE relevant to the level of contact they will have with confirmed and suspected COVID-19 \ncases. \nEnsure that staff and incarcerated/detained persons who require respiratory protection (e.g., N95s) for their \no \nwork responsibilities have been medically cleared, trained, and fit-tested in the context of an employer's \nrespiratory protection program. \nFor PPE training materials and posters, please visit the CDC website on Protecting Healthcare Personnel. \no \n•  Ensure that all staff are trained to perform hand hygiene after removing PPE. \n•  If administrators anticipate that incarcerated/detained persons will request unnecessary PPE, consider \nproviding training on the different types of PPE that are needed for differing degrees of contact with \nCOVID-19 cases and contacts, and the reasons for those differences (see Table 1). Monitor linked CDC \nguidelines in Table 1 for updates to recommended PPE. \n•  Keep recommended PPE near the spaces in the facility where it could be needed, to facilitate quick \naccess in an emergency. \n•  Recommended PPE for incarcerated/detained individuals and staff in a correctional facility will vary \nbased on the type of contact they have with COVID-19 cases and their contacts (see Table 1). Each type of \nrecommended PPE is defined below.

I am the Facility Administrator at the Northwest Immigration and Customs Enforcement \n2 \nProcessing Center (NWIPC) and an individually named defendant in these proceedings.  I am \n3 \nover the age of eighteen (18), and I am competent to testify in this matter.  My statement is \n4 \n5  based upon my personal knowledge, and my education, training, and experience.   \n6 \n2.  I have experience managing viral pandemics in secure settings.  I was with the Bureau of \n7 \nPrisons for 26.5 years and have been with GEO assigned to NWIPC since July of 2018.  \n8 \n9  COVID-19 is not the first viral pandemic necessitating protocols at NWIPC.  I have been in \n10 \nconformance  with  CDC  guidelines  and  successfully  guarded  against  the  deadly \n11 \ncommunication of other deadly viral diseases such as Zika, Ebola, H1N1 Swine Flu, and AIDS-\n12 \n13  HIV in secure settings.   \n14 \n3.  Having said that, GEO takes no position on the motion before the Court.  GEO provides this \n15 \ndeclaration for purposes of aiding the Court in making an informed decision.   \n16 \n17  4.  Attached at Ex. A is a true and correct copy of the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention \n18 \nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus \n19 \nDisease 2019 (COVID-19) In Correctional and Detention Facilities (CDC Guidance), which is \n20 \n21  the guidance GEO has used to educate its personnel and detainees at NWIPC on COVID-19.  \n22 \nMy declaration below provides some specifics about GEO’s implementation of the guidelines \n23 \nat NWIPC.  I have not attempted to describe in totality each and every action I have taken to \n24 \n25  implement the guidelines or any other precautions, nor could I do so within the limitations of \n26 \na publicly filed declaration.  However, I hope to convey to the Court that GEO is being \n27 \nproactive and is taking COVID-19 seriously to reduce the risk of infection. \n28 \n29  5.  The health, safety, and well-being of detainees at NWIPC correlates with the health, safety, \n30 \nand well-being of GEO staff, GEO administration, and our families.  Our interests are aligned \n31 \n32 \nIII BRANCHES LAW, PLLC \nJoan K.

To date, NWIPC has no positive findings of COVID-19 among the detainee population or staff, \n4 \n5  which statistically means NWIPC has avoided contamination more successfully than Pierce \n6 \nCounty as a whole.  If we remain diligent, with the support and cooperation of both detainees, \n7 \nemployees, and visitors, we expect to survive the COVID-19 pandemic in the same manner \n8 \n9  and with the same success as our present performance measures indicate to date and as we \n10 \nhave done with past pandemics and epidemics. \n11 \n7.  To achieve our common goal of protecting the health, safety, and welfare of those individual \n12 \n13  either detained, working at, or visiting NWIC, we have implemented the following precautions \n14 \nwith Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) oversight. \n15 \nOperational and Communications Preparations for COVID-19 \n16 \n17  8.  Recognizing Signs and Symptoms.  NWIPC operates solely as an ICE processing center with \n18 \nthe full advantages of onsite health care services provided by ICE Health Services Corps.  In \n19 \ncoordination with ICE, we have informed staff and detainees to recognize the symptoms of \n20 \n21  COVID-19, and how to respond if symptoms develop or are observed.   \n22 \n9.  Communication and Coordination.  I meet routinely and daily on site with ICE Officer in \n23 \nCharge (“OIC”)  Drew  Bostock and the Health  Services Administrator (“HSA”)  for the \n24 \n25  Immigration Health Service Corps (“IHSC”).  We have been jointly implementing precautions \n26 \nas information develops specific to COVID-19.  We have a positive collaborative working \n27 \nrelationship  that  allows  us  to  adapt  operations  and  communications  appropriately  and \n28 \n29  according to CDC Guidelines. \n30 \n31 \n32 \nIII BRANCHES LAW, PLLC \nJoan K.

Contingency Planning.  GEO is operating below capacity and is not overpopulated, nor does \n2 \nGEO anticipate an overpopulation status at NWIC in the foreseeable future.  GEO  has a \n3 \nsufficient workforce to operate at capacity and without staffing shortages in the event any GEO \n4 \n5  staff become symptomatic. GEO has developed contingency plans for reduced workforces \n6 \nfrom absences in conjunction with the employees’ union, and we are coordinating with our \n7 \ncommunity partners about our preparedness and preparations specific to COVID-19 that may \n8 \n9  temporarily alter day to day operations. \n10 \n11. Review of Existing Pandemic Protocols and Disaster Preparedness and Revisions for \n11  COVID-19 \n \n12 \n  GEO has dedicated housing areas and bathrooms and other physical locations for purposes of \n13 \nisolating confirmed COVID-19 cases and individuals displaying COVID-19 symptoms, and to \n14 \n15  quarantine known close contacts of cases.  At NWIPC medical isolation and quarantine \n16 \nlocations  are  separate.   We   have  planned  for  contingencies  for  multiple  locations  for \n17 \nsimultaneous use to avoid cohorting as defined in CDC Guidance. \n18 \n19  12. Coordination with Court Officials.  With regard to Court operations, GEO has taken \n20 \ndirection from and coordinated with the Executive Office for Immigration Review (“EIOR”) \n21 \nand ICE consistent with the testimony of OIC Bostock.  GEO has accommodated continuing \n22 \n23  Court operations for essential hearings through video conferencing from separate rooms.  The \n24 \nparticipants have three discreet rooms.  The Judge holds the hearing in the main courtroom, \n25 \nICE counsel appears telephonically from his or her offices, and the detainee, his or her attorney \n26 \n27  and a limited number of his or her select witnesses appear in the video-teleconferencing \n28 \ncourtroom where GEO security is present.  The video-teleconferencing room is large enough \n29 \nin size to allow for social distancing, which detainees and staff have been encouraged to follow.  \n30 \n31  The Courtrooms have tissue and wastebaskets.  GEO has trained on proper cough or sneezing \n32 \nIII BRANCHES LAW, PLLC \nJoan K.

Signage.  GEO  has  posted  signage  that identifies  symptoms  of  COVID-19 in multiple \n6 \nlanguages, and that provide hand hygiene instructions.  GEO has described symptoms and has \n7 \ndemonstrated hand hygiene instructions in daily briefings referred to as “town hall” meetings \n8 \n9  with detainees.  Detainees have been asked to report symptoms to staff. \n10 \n14. Transfers and Movements.  Plaintiffs’ experts opine at Dkt. 37-1 at 4 that extensive transfers \n11 \nof individuals throughout the detention system creates risk.   GEO has cooperated with ICE \n12 \n13  implementation of newer ICE policy directives that have reduced the number of detainees \n14 \nentering NWIPC as explained in the Declaration of Drew Bostock from ICE.   To date, the \n15 \nabsence of any positive case of COVID-19 has meant that internal movements have not yet \n16 \n17  been prohibited although social distancing protocols have been implemented, see below. \n18 \n    A.  External Transfers:  ICE controls who is housed at NWIPC.  GEO does not transfer \n19 \ndetainees externally among GEO facilities.  Anyone transferred to or from NWIPC are moved \n20 \n21  on orders from ICE in conformance with ICE protocols implemented in response to COVID \n22 \n19.  GEO may not use the additional bed space available given the reduced ICE detainee \n23 \npopulation to house non-ICE detainees.  GEO has utilized the available bed space to implement \n24 \n25  COVID 19 protocols to include separating incoming ICE detainees to reduce contact. \n26 \n    B.  Internal Movements:  With respect to people entering or leaving the facility, GEO \n27 \nas a secure private facility with ICE as its sole client may regulate who enters and exits the \n28 \n29  facility and under what conditions with ICE oversight more easily than the courts, grocery \n30 \nstores, hospitals, jails, and prisons.  In this regard, GEO has taken the following precautions: \n31 \n32 \nIII BRANCHES LAW, PLLC \nJoan K.

Incoming Detainees.  Incoming  detainees have a fourteen-day waiting \n2 \nperiod before housed in the general population.  During the waiting period, new detainees are \n3 \nscreened  for  COVID  19  exposure  before  moving  into  an  assigned  housing  unit.    Any \n4 \n5  symptomatic detainee is placed by him or herself into a single housing unit where his or her \n6 \nsymptoms are monitored by ICE’s public health care providers.  The ICE public health doctors \n7 \nmay test individual detainees per medical standards, and medically treat any detainee in need \n8 \n9  of care.  GEO does not place any such individual back into the general population without \n10 \nmedical clearance provided by ICE. \n11 \n      ii.  Staff.  Anyone  coming  into  NWIPC  to  work  completes  a  screening \n12 \n13  questionnaire that GEO personnel use to decide whether the person has been exposed.  If \n14 \nexposed or at an unreasonable risk of having been exposed the individual may not enter.  GEO \n15 \n16  staff take the temperature of employees before entry.  Anyone who tests above 100.4℉ must \n17 \nreturn home until cleared medically.  Staff are advised to stay home when sick or if they have \n18 \n19  COVID-19 symptoms or have been in close contact with anyone who has COVID-19.  GEO \n20 \nhas informed staff that if staff develop symptoms while on duty, the staff person must leave \n21 \nthe facility as soon as possible and follow CDC recommended steps for persons who are ill \n22 \n23  with  COVD-19  symptoms,  including  self-isolating  at  home,  contacting  their  healthcare \n24 \nprovider as soon as possible to determine whether the staff person needs to be evaluated and \n25 \ntested, and contact the supervisor.  GEO has identified staff whose duties would allow them to \n26 \n27  work from home and has planned for staff absences.  GEO has offered revised duties to staff \n28 \nwho are at higher risk of severe illness.  GEO staff have been offered the seasonal influenza \n29 \nvaccine in the past.  ICE follows its protocols for providing vaccines to detainees, which has \n30 \n31  included influenza vaccines. \n32 \nIII BRANCHES LAW, PLLC \nJoan K.

Supplies.  I have assessed GEO’s stock of hygiene supplies, cleaning supplies, PPE, and \n3 \nmedical supplies (separately from Public Health) to ensure NWIPC has on hand and available \n4 \n5  proper supplies.  I have a plan in place to keep supply stocks replenished as needed if a COVID-\n6 \n19 transmission occurs within the facility.  NWIPC has supplies that comply with CDC \n7 \nguidelines.  Detainees do not have to purchase soap.  Soap dispensers with liquid soap are at \n8 \n9  each common area sink and shower.  Detainees in individual units with sinks have their own \n10 \nbar of soap.  We have paper towels, tissues, toilet paper, and sanitary protection.  We have \n11 \nalcohol-based sanitizer in specified locations.  We have decided to relax our standards that \n12 \n13  prohibit  alcohol-based  hand  sanitizer  within  the  facility  and  have  purchased  more  for \n14 \nadditional distribution upon delivery. \n15 \n16. Respiratory Protection.  GEO has an established respiratory protection program with fit \n16 \n17  testing and training so that PPE is correctly donned, doffed, and disposed of properly.  GEO \n18 \nhas at NWIPC sufficient surgical type face masks for each detainee if needed. \n19 \n17. Intensified Cleaning.  GEO has implemented intensified cleaning of surfaces and objects that \n20 \n21  are frequently touched, especially in common areas.  GEO has instructed detainees and staff \n22 \nto clean and disinfect shared equipment and property with frequency.  GEO  uses EPA-\n23 \nregistered disinfectants that are represented to be effective against the virus that causes COVID \n24 \n25  - 19.  GEO is not diluting disinfectants below effective levels.  GEO has gloves for use with \n26 \ncleaning.  Cleanings occur throughout the day multiple times.  Detainees have not complained \n27 \nabout the availability of cleaning supplies.    \n28 \n29  18.

We \n2 \ninform people to avoid sharing eating utensils, dishes, and cups, and to avoid non-essential \n3 \nphysical contact.  We have running water and hand drying capabilities throughout the facility.  \n4 \n5  19. Property.  The property in a detainee’s possession upon intake is inventoried and placed in \n6 \nstorage in individualized containers.  The storage is secure location.  Any access to detainee \n7 \nstorage requires a detainee request that is processed through multiple levels of review that \n8 \n9  would likely prevent contamination within the facility. \n10 \n20. Air Circulation.  Accreditation standard requires NWIPC to have fifteen exchanges per hour, \n11 \nwhich is above typical office standards.  NWIPC has consistently met these high standards. \n12 \n13  Social Distancing Strategies \n14 \n21. Certain social distancing recommendations have already been part of GEO’s operations.  GEO \n15 \nhas limited open movement.  Anyone individual designated to go to the library or barbershop \n16 \n17  may go to the library or  barbershop.  Individual detainees are not moving in mass from location \n18 \nto location at will.  Recreational space and time are dedicated by housing unit.  Detainees are \n19 \nnot all using the same recreational space.  There is sufficient space for individuals to recreate \n20 \n21  six feet from one another.  Meals are served inside housing units and cells.  Movements are by \n22 \nhousing unit.  Group activities occur by housing unit.  Medical screens new intakes separately \n23 \nfrom the main medical facility and general population. \n24 \n25  22. GEO has encouraged staff and detainees to increase the space between one another as feasible.   \n26 \nVisitors \n27 \n23. ICE has authorized GEO to temporarily stop visitors from meeting with detainees, except legal \n28 \n29  counsel who confer with clients in separate rooms through glass enclosures.    \n30 \nInfections Control/PPE \n31 \n32 \nIII BRANCHES LAW, PLLC \nJoan K.

PPE. GEO staff have personal protective gear, including N95 respirators.  PPE are stored in \n2 \nspaces in the facility where PPE can be accessed when needed and in an emergency.   Staff \n3 \nhave been trained to perform hand hygiene after removing PPE.  Attorney visitors must wear \n4 \n5  face masks.  If the attorney visitor does not bring a face mask, GEO provides one. \n6 \nVerbal Screening and Temperature Check Protocols \n7 \n25.  Screening.  GEO screens all staff, attorneys, court visitors, and detainees.  Subcontractors and \n8 \n9  vendors never enter the facility.  Staff get their temperature checked and answer screening \n10 \nquestions.  Detainees who enter NWIPC are screened prior to entry into the main secured \n11 \nfacility.  Detainees must answer questionnaires and have their temperature checked.  Screening \n12 \n13  includes questioning whether today or in the past 24 hours the person has had symptoms like \n14 \nfever, felt feverish, or had chills, cough, or difficulty breathing.  It is asked whether in the past \n15 \nfourteen days the person had contact with a person known to be infected with the novel \n16 \n17  coronavirus COVID-19.  Detainees who have observable symptoms are placed in medical \n18 \nisolation.  Staff wear PPE when performing temperature checks.  \n19 \nMedical Isolation and Quarantine \n20 \n21  26. GEO has the capacity to medically isolate and quarantine detainees who test positive for \n22 \nCOVID-19. \n23 \n27. GEO defers to ICE public health with respect to their medical isolation and quarantine \n24 \n25  protocols for detainees. \n26 \nHealthcare Evaluation/Clinical Care \n27 \n28. NWIPC has the advantage of onsite health care services through ICE Health Services Corp.  \n28 \n29  Detainees at NWIPC have access to timely health care that I do not have, and my staff do not \n30 \nhave on the outside. \n31 \n32 \nIII BRANCHES LAW, PLLC \nJoan K.

I  am currently an Assistant Field Office Director (\"AFOD\") of Enforcement and \n5 \nRemoval Operations (\"ERO\"), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\"), \n6  in the Los Angeles, California ICE Field Office. I have held this position since January \n2011. I am currently the Officer in Charge at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center (the \n7 \n\"APC\") in Adelanto, California. I have worked in various other positions within ICE \n8  and the former Immigration and Naturalization Service since June 21, 1998. \n9 \n2.  A  detainee  may  request  a  non-recorded/non-monitored  legal  call  at the  APC  by \n10  submitting a request to GEO through the kite (informal request) system to have the \nattorney phone number placed on a non-recorded/non-monitored legal call status. GEO \n11 \nstaff will research the number to verify it is a valid number to the stated person/office \n12  and place the number on the unmonitored list via the Talton platform. Currently, the \nAPC does not accept attorney requests to be placed on non-recorded/non-monitored \n13 \nlegal call status. Attorneys have been instructed to contact their clients and advise them \n14  to use the above procedure. Detainees are all apprised of the process by which to ensure \nlegal calls are not monitored by instructions in the supplemental handbook provided to \n15 \neach detainee during intake processing and through postings in the housing units and \n16  intake hold rooms. \n17 \n3.  Detainees at the APC and attorneys have successfully placed phone numbers on non-\n18  recorded/non-monitored legal call status using the procedure described in Paragraph 2. \n19 \n4.  Positive acceptance for a specific phone number may be removed at the request of the \n20  affected detainee, attorney or other affected party. Currently, a detainee may submit a \nrequest on behalf of himself or his attorney to GEO to request removal of positive \n21 \nacceptance for a specific phone number, but if positive acceptance is removed, the \n22 \ndetainee will be charged for a failed call. An affected party that is not the detainee or \ndetainee's attorney may submit a request to have their phone number set to passive \n23 \nacceptance to GEO management or ICE management at the APC. \n24 \n5.  There has been one recent request for removal of positive acceptance at the APC. The \n25 \nrequest was granted. \n26 \n6.  As of the date of this declaration, there have been two contact attorney visits (i.e., in \n27 \nperson with no plexiglass barrier) at the APC since the imposition of COVID-19 \n28 \n2 \n\nCCaassee  55::1187--ccvv--0022650144--JJGGBB--SSHHKK      DDooccuummeenntt  123596--15      FFiilleedd  0044//0068//2200      PPaaggee  45  ooff  78      PPaaggee  IIDD\n  ##::15347715\n1  procedures on March 13, 2020. The attorneys requested these visits and appeared at the \nfacility with proper personal protective equipment. \n2 \n3  7.  The APC has eight attorney visit rooms, four asylum interview rooms and two consular \nvisit rooms at the Adelanto West facility.  There are two attorney visit rooms, three \n4 \nasylum interview rooms, one visitation room with a pass-through window (through \n5  which documents may be passed) and one consular visit room at the Adelanto East \nfacility, for a total of twenty-one rooms at the APC. The twenty-one rooms identified \n6 \nare currently available for private telephonic attorney-client conferences. The attorney \n7  visit  rooms may  be  used  for contact  visits and  private  telephonic attorney-client \nconferences, and the other rooms (asylum interview rooms and consular visit rooms) \n8 \nmay be temporarily used for private telephonic attorney-client conferences. \n9 \n8.  A detainee may submit a request for a private call in one of the rooms described in \n10 \nParagraph 7 by using the kite (informal request) system.  The request must include the \n11  phone number, date and requested time for the call. Currently, attorneys may request \nto schedule a call through ICE. ICE and GEO are exploring options to allow for \n12 \nattorneys to schedule calls directly with the facility. The APC asks for 24-hours' notice \n13  but will accommodate calls as soon as practicable. Calls may be accommodated at any \nhour barring any unforeseen or emergent issues in the facility. The only time of day \n14 \nrestrictions on use of these rooms is during counts, which typically take between 30 \n15  and 45 minutes. \n16 \n9.  There are 30 ICE Deportation Officers (\"DO's\") at the APC. Each DO is assigned an \n17  office number and an email address containing first and last names, as well as middle \ninitials in many instances. The email address is for internal communications with other \n18 \nERO, government and contract entities as well as limited outside entities at the DO's \n19  discretion. \n20 \n10.If an attorney wants to contact a DO at the APC, they may call the facility and request \n21  to be transferred to the DO. If the DO does not pick up the phone, they may leave the \nDO a voice message. Attorneys may also email a general inbox at the Los Angeles \n22 \nERO Field Office, which will  be routed to the DO. Attorneys may also call the \n23 \nDetention Reporting and Information Line (DRIL) for assistance and their message \nwill be routed to the facility to be distributed to the correct DO. Attorneys may also \n24 \nmail, courier, or otherwise deliver documents and requests to the facility. For attorneys \n25 \nwho visit the facility, there are drop boxes in each lobby for documents, client passports \nand other identity documents, messages for DO's and other information attorneys wish \n26 \nto deliver to DO's. These boxes are checked multiple times during each workday \n27 \n(Monday -Friday) and the information is delivered directly to the DO's desks. \n28 \n3 \n\nCCaassee  55::1187--ccvv--0022650144--JJGGBB--SSHHKK      DDooccuummeenntt  123596--15      FFiilleedd  0044//0068//2200      PPaaggee  56  ooff  78      PPaaggee  IIDD\n  ##::15347726\n1  11.DO's  are  continually  moving  through  the  APC  during  their  shifts,  presenting \ndocuments to  detainees  for  signature, serving NTA's, serving  parole  documents, \n2 \nserving notices and decisions, speaking with detainees, conducting detainee interviews, \n3  answering detainee requests in person, conducting observation of the facility, among \nmany other duties. As a result, DO's are often away from their desks and email, such \n4 \nthat  providing their  contact  information  would  be of limited  use  to  immigration \n5  attorneys and organizations. \n6 \n12.To my knowledge, as a general matter, ICE field offices do not typically provide \n7  individual contact information of DO's to immigration attorneys or organizations. \nAlthough an ICE employee may choose to share their email address with parties outside \n8 \nthe government, there is no requirement and I am not aware of any established ICE \n9  field office or headquarters policy requiring such disclosure. \n10 \n13.Providing DO information poses security and privacy risks for the DO's and their \n11  families.  Government  email  addresses  contain  data  that  could  be  utilized  to \ncompromise an employee's personal data and locate a person's residence or family \n12 \nresidence addresses.  The current hostile environment created by some members of the \n13  public toward ICE places ICE employees at greater risk of harm or retaliation for \nperceived actions or associations in the course of their duties. \n14 \n15  14.Providing DO information poses logistical difficulties and would be of little practical \nuse to immigration attorneys and organizations. Officers frequently change roles and \n16 \nfacilities, such that any contact information provided would quickly become out-of-\n17  date and would require continual updating. \n18 \n15.New detainees are being brought to the APC during the COVID-19 pandemic. All new \n19  arrival  detainees are medically screened  in a more thorough manner than facility \nvisitors. In addition, these detainees are housed separately from the general population \n20 \nfor fourteen days to allow for observation for any onset of COVID-19 symptoms. \n21 \nDuring  those  fourteen  days,  these  detainees  are  not  introduced  into  the  general \npopulation. During those  fourteen days, new detainees have  equivalent access to \n22 \nattorney visits, telephones, and tablets as detainees in the general population. \n23 \n16.Detainees are issued a pin number upon arrival to the APC. This allows detainees \n24 \naccess to the phone and tablet systems. Detainees may use this pin to retrieve voice \n25 \nmessages using the Talton system. For detainees to be able to video call or receive calls \non the tablets, they must set up an account at Gettingout.com. Tablets are always freely \n26 \navailable in the individual housing units, medical infirmary, and special management \n27 \nunit, except when charging. Tablets are charged in a rotating process to ensure there \nare always tablets ready for use. In order to make video calls, the tablets must be docked \n28 \n4 \n\nCCaassee 5 5:1:178-c-cvv-0-022561044-J-JGGBB-S-SHHKK     D Dooccuummeennt t2 15369-5-1     F Filieledd 0 044/0/086/2/200     P Paaggee 7 6 o of f8 7     P Paaggee I DID\n # #:5:1437773\n1  at the one of the two docking stations in each of the housing unit dayrooms. The \ndocking stations are mounted to walls within the general access areas of the dorms. \n2 \nTablets cannot be utilized outside the assigned housing units due to the limitations of \n3  the linking technology. When making audio calls, detainees may move around their \nhousing unit with the tablets. \n4 \n5  17.Detainees can use the tablets to videoconference with their attorneys, as well as family \nand friends. On the tablets, detainees may also receive  pictures and send/receive \n6 \nmessages. Detainees may not send photos due to security concerns. \n7 \n18.Audio calls on the tablets are the same cost as phone calls from phones in housing units, \n8 \nwhich is 7 cents per minute for most calls. Video calls are approximately a flat rate of \n9  21 cents per minute. \n10 \n19.Detainees who are assessed to have symptoms associated with COVID-19 infection are \n11  isolated in a negative pressure room in the medical infirmary and tested for COVID-\n19, as well as Influenza A&B. If the detainee has been housed, his or her housing unit \n12 \nwill  be  placed  on  modified  programming  and  monitored  daily  with \n13  temperature/symptom  screenings  until  the  result  of  the  COVID-19 test \nis received. Only detainees presenting with the symptoms that the Centers for Disease \n14 \nControl and Prevention has identified as being associated with COVID-19 infection \n15  will be tested.  These symptoms include fever (temperature above 100.4 degrees), \nshortness of breath (as assessed and defined by a medical provider), and cough. \n16 \n17  20.Medical isolation/quarantine is dependent on test results.  A detainee suspected of \nhaving  COVID-19  is  placed  alone in  negative  pressure  room  in  the  medical \n18 \ninfirmary.  As of the date of this declaration, detainees at the APC have only had \n19  COVID-19 test results come back negative and the turnaround time on those tests have \nbeen  2-3  days. A  positive  COVID-19  test  result  could  require  many  days  of \n20 \nisolation/quarantine for the detainee depending on their symptoms. Detainees who are \n21 \nin  medical  isolation  for  possible  COVID-19  infection  or  confirmed  COVID-19 \ninfection should not be moved out of a negative pressure room for court/attorney visits \n22 \nor any other reason.  Detainees in medical isolation will have access to mail, phones, \n23 \nand tablets similar to detainees in general population - however, phones and tablets \nmust be thoroughly disinfected once used by the detainee. \n24 \n25 \n21.The APC has COVID-19 test kits. \n26 \n22.No APC detainee or staff member has tested positive for COVID-19. \n27 \n28 \n5 \n\nCCaassee 5 5:1:178-c-cvv-0-022561044-J-JGGBB-S-SHHKK     D Dooccuummeennt t2 15369-5-1     F Filieledd 0 044/0/086/2/200     P Paaggee 8 7 o of f8 7     P Paaggee I DID\n # #:5:1437784\n1  23.When there is a suspicion that an individual in a housing unit was exposed to COVID-\n19, their housing unit is placed in modified programming pending the results of the \n2 \nCOVLD-19 test on the suspect detainee. During modified programming, the housing \n3  unit does not eat meals in the dining hall and does not interact with other housing units. \nThe housing unit will be monitored for symptoms and fever twice a day. \n4 \n5  24.If positive, the infected alien will remain in medical isolation for the duration of his/her \ntreatment. For the housing unit that was on modified programming, it will become a \n6 \ncohort and will be in that status for fourteen days unless another detainee becomes \nsymptomatic which would then extend the cohort. \n8 \n25.The APC has one housing unit currently on modified programming. \n9 \n10 \nI declare under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746 that the foregoing is true \n11  and correct. \n12 \nExecuted this 6' day of April, 2020 \n13 \n14 \nGabriel Va \n15  Assistant Field Office Director, Los Angeles \nEnforcement and Removal Operations \n16 \nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n-y) \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n6 ",

I   am   the   Director   of   Visitation   and   Independent   Monitoring   for   Freedom   for   Immigrants,   a  \nnational   non-pro�t   organization   that   seeks   to   end   the   isolation   of   people   in   immigration  \ndetention.    I   am   over   the   age   of   eighteen   (18).    I   am   competent   to   testify   in   this   matter.    My  \nstatement   is   based   upon   my   personal   knowledge,   and   my   education,   training,   and   experience.  \n \n2. Freedom   for   Immigrants   operates   the   National   Immigration   Detention   Hotline.    The  \nNational   Immigration   Detention   Hotline   is   a   monitoring   tool   through   which   we   gather   data  \nthrough   free,   unmonitored   phone   calls   from   people   in   immigration   detention   and   their   loved  \nones   on   a   daily   basis   with   a   team   of   highly   trained   and   dedicated   volunteers.   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-1   Filed 04/12/20   Page 3 of 5   Page ID\n #:5520\n3. Freedom   for   Immigrants   also   coordinates   a   network   of   community-led   visitation   groups  \noperating   in   69   immigrant   prisons   and   jails   in   26   states   with   over   4,500   visitor   volunteers.  \nThese   visitor   volunteers,   who   also   receive   phone   calls   and   correspondence   from   people   inside  \ndetention,   also   track   reports   from   people   detained.  \n \n4. From   April   1st   to   April   10th,   2020,   Freedom   for   Immigrants   (“FFI”)    has   received   the  \nfollowing   reports   through   the   National   Immigration   Detention   Hotline   (“NIDH”)   and   the  \nvisitation   network   from   people   in   immigration   detention   and   their   loved   ones   regarding  \ncurrent   conditions   in   the   following   facilities.    I   will   note   that   there   is   no   particular   script   or  \nquestionnaire   provided   to   visitor   or   hotline   volunteers   to   ask   people   in   detention;   they   simply  \nreport   what   individuals   in   detention   choose   to   report   to   them.  \n \n5. Adelanto   Detention   Facility.    From   April   1st   to   April   10th,   2020,   FFI   has   �elded  \napproximately   12   NIDH   calls   regarding   the   Adelanto   facility.   Of   those   calls,   11   have  \nspeci�cally   sought   assistance   with   responding   to   GEO’s   failure   to   provide   adequate   basic  \nnecessities,   or   the   company’s   use   of   detained   immigrants   to   clean   within   their   dorms,   pods,   and  \ncommon   areas.   Based   on   these   calls,   FFI   has   determined:   \na) Individuals   in   detention   at   Adelanto   are   having   to   work   as   usual,   without   being  \nprovided   with   personal   protective   equipment   (PPE).  \nb) Only   water   is   currently   being   provided   to   workers   in   order   to   clean   the   bathrooms;   no  \nsoap   or   alcohol-based   products.  \nc) There   is   no   hand   sanitizer   provided.  \nd) Most   sta�   are   not   wearing   PPE,   including   one   guard   who   appears   to   have   symptoms   of  \ncoronavirus.  \ne) There   are   multiple   detained   individuals   who   are   displaying   symptoms   of   coronavirus.  \nf) There   is   a   complete   inability   for   people   in   detention   to   practice   social   distancing   as  \ndorms   house   up   to   100   individuals,   which   makes   everyone   inside   very   anxious.  \ng) There   is   limited   to   no   information   provided   about   COVID-19   and   how   people   can  \nprotect   themselves;   what   little   information   is   provided,   is   provided   in   English.   \nh) ICE   is   continuing   to   bring   new   detained   individuals   into   the   detention   facility.  \ni) Detained   people   are   undergoing   hunger   strikes   to   protest   detention   conditions.   \n \n6.

SUMMARY OF QUALIFICATIONS AND MATERIALS REVIEWED \n \n1.  I am a physician licensed in the State of California (License #A106190).  I \ncurrently work as Senior Technical Advisor for Community Partners International (CPI), a \nnon-profit organization support health and human development for the people of Myanmar. \nI also am a volunteer physician with Venice Family Clinic and provide primary care services \nto homeless individuals in Los Angeles. As part of the COVID-19 response I am working \nwith VFC to screen and manage clinical care for patients, including individuals with suspected \nor confirmed COVID-19.  \n2.  I also have joined the Los Angeles County Emergency Surge Unit, as a clinical \nprovider in one of the isolation / quarantine units for individuals with COVID-19 tests results \n  1 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-2   Filed 04/12/20   Page 3 of 17   Page ID\n #:5525\nthat are pending, negative or positive. I am familiar with protocols representing the standard \nof care in Los Angeles County for individuals with suspected or confirmed case of COVID-\n19. \n3.  I am a graduate of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine; I completed \nmy  postgraduate  clinical  training  in  the  Primary  Care  Program  at  Montefiore  Medical \nCenter/Albert Einstein School of Medicine in New York; followed by two and a half years of \nresearch and policy training as a Fellow in the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Clinical \nScholars Program (RWJF), one and a half years of research training as a at UCLA.  In addition \nto  my  Medical  Degree,  I  also  hold  a  Masters  in  Public  Health,  with  an  emphasis  on \nepidemiology and international health, which I obtained at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School \nof Public Health (2005); a Doctor of Philosophy degree (PhD) in health services research at \nthe UCLA School of Public Health (2013); and a Diploma in Tropical Medicine and Hygiene \n(DTM&H) awarded jointly by the University of Cayetano Heredia in Lima, Peru and the \nUniversity of Alabama. From 2013. Until December 31 , 2019 I was appointed as Assistant \nst\nProfessor in the Department of Medicine at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) \nMedical Center. \n4.  During my MD, masters, PhD and Fellowship studies, and as Faculty in the \nDepartment of Medicine at UCLA I participated as both a student and an instructor in multiple \ncourses on the theory and practice of health and human rights. I am a volunteer with Health \nRights International (formerly Doctors of the World) and since 2009 I have served as a \nmember of the Board of Directors of Physicians for Human Rights (PHR). I serve as a \nvoluntary medical provider for both organizations. I have received specialized training at \n  2 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-2   Filed 04/12/20   Page 4 of 17   Page ID\n #:5526\nMontefiore Medical Center, at the Human Rights Clinic in the Bronx, and at seminars \nsponsored by Doctors of the World and Physicians for Human Rights, in the use of medical \nskills for the documentation and treatment of survivors of torture.   \n5.  I am faculty co-sponsor of the Los Angeles Human Rights Clinic (LAHRI) at \nUCLA, and I supervise and mentor recently trained faculty, internal medicine residents and \nmedical students to conduct mental health and medical (physical) forensic evaluations of \nindividuals seeking asylum in the United States. I have conducted forensic evaluations of \nasylum seekers detained at Adelanto, and am personally familiar with the basic layout the \nfacility, and the conditions of detention prior to COVID-19. \n6.  I have worked for the past nineteen years as a Program Director, and am \ncurrently Senior Technical Advisor and a member of the Board of Directors, for Community \nPartners International (CPI, formerly known as the Global Health Access Program), a non-\nprofit organization based in the United States training health workers to provide health \nservices and measure the health status of marginalized and internally displaced persons living \nin remote areas of Burma/Myanmar. As part of my work with CPI I have designed, managed \nand evaluated programs to control infectious diseases including malaria and tuberculosis; and \nI am advising CPI as it develops its policies and response to COVID-19. I have co-authored \nmultiple  published  reports,  peer-reviewed  articles,  and  a  book  chapter  on  malaria, \nhumanitarian assistance, and health and human rights in Burma/Myanmar. \n \n7.  In this Declaration, I interpret the policies at Adelanto related to the prevention \nand treatment of COVID-19 infection, in light of current scientific evidence and best practices \n  3 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-2   Filed 04/12/20   Page 5 of 17   Page ID\n #:5527\nfor clinical and public health interventions designed to prevent, diagnose and treat COVID-\n19 among individuals and populations. \n8.  I  have  been  provided  by  counsel  for  the  Plaintiffs  with  copies  of  the \nDeclarations of James Janecka, Facility Administrator at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center; \nand of Gabriel Valdez, Assistant Field Director of ICE. Henceforth these two declarations are \nreferred to, respectively, as “Janecka” and “Valdez.” I also have reviewed the Declarations of \nC. J. H.-S., Yoselin Reina Moran, and Jairo Guardado Aparicio, all of whom are currently \ndetained or recently released immigrants at Adelanto. \n9.  This Declaration references several official government documents that provide \nofficial guidance related to COVID-19 procedures  \n•  Federal guidance specific to detention facilities such as Adelanto is provided in \na document issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), entitled \n“Interim  Guidance  on  Management  of  Coronavirus  Disease  2019  (COVID-19)  in \nCorrectional and Detention Facilities,” hereafter referred to as “CDC Guidance in Detention”. \nQuoted language appeared the version posed online on March 23, 2020. \n•  Los Angeles County guidance “HEALTH OFFICER ORDER FOR THE \nCONTROL OF COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Quarantine Order,” hereafter referred \nto as “LA County Guidance.” Issued April 1, 2020. \nB.  FINDINGS AND INTERPRETATIONS \n \n10.  Although there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 at Adelanto (to date), \ncurrent policies and practice at Adelanto are insufficient to prevent the introduction \nand spread of COVID-19, and create an unacceptable risk to detainees. \n  4 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-2   Filed 04/12/20   Page 6 of 17   Page ID\n #:5528\n11.  Before commenting on the stated policies and practices specific to Adelanto it \nis important to note that public health experts agree that limiting detention, through \nreductions in the number of newly detained individuals as well as the safe release of \ncurrent detainees, is an important step authorities can take to combat the spread of \nCOVID-19.  \n12.  It is highly likely that COVID-19 will be introduced into the Adelanto \npopulation. The question is not whether this will happen, but when. Southern California is \nexperiencing “community spread” of COVID-19, and infectious individuals are assumed to \nlive in most if not all communities, including where the staff who work at Adelanto live. Many \nindividuals with  COVID-19  are  asymptomatic  for  the  duration  of  their  infections,  and \nemerging evidence suggests that people with these sub-clinical infections can pass on COVID-\n19 to other people. It also is well documented that many individuals who eventually become \nsymptomatic are infectious for at least 48 hours prior to developing symptoms, and it is \nestimated that approximately 10 percent of infections in our communities are transmitted by \npeople who are asymptomatic. In the absence of a robust screening initiative to test any and \nall individuals entering Adelanto, including those who are asymptomatic, it is highly likely that \nsome people will enter Adelanto who are infected with COVID-19. The limited availability of \ntesting in the U.S. in general, and California and Los Angeles in particular, means that mass \nscreening of asymptomatic people is unlikely to be proposed much less initiated at Adelanto, \nnor anywhere else in Los Angeles, in the next several weeks or, possibly, months. (Due to the \nrelatively low accuracy of currently available testing methods it is also possible that even an \n  5 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-2   Filed 04/12/20   Page 7 of 17   Page ID\n #:5529\naggressive testing strategy would not identify everyone infected with COVID-19, though it is \nnot necessary to articulate the reasons for this in the present Declaration.  \n13.  Once COVID-19 is introduced into Adelanto, it is highly likely that it will \ninfect a large proportion of the detained population. COVID-19 can be transmitted \nthrough casual contact with infectious individuals, the surfaces they have touched, or by simply \nspending time in the same room as someone who is infected. The physical architecture of \nfacilities where most detainees will share their living space with multiple detainees for at least \npart of their day, inherently creates conditions that promote the spread of infectious diseases \nsuch as COVID-19.  \n14.  Several strategies exist that may reduce the rate of transmission, though \nthere is no evidence to suggest that these strategies, either alone or in combination, \nwill be sufficient to prevent sustained transmission and eliminate the disease. It is \ngenerally  agreed  that  several  tools  are  likely  to  reduce  transmission  of  COVID-19  in \ncommunities,  health  care  settings,  and  other  group  settings.  These  include:  timely \nidentification and isolation of individuals with confirmed or suspected infections; quarantine \nof individuals who come into close contact with confirmed or suspected cases; and social \ndistancing, which consists of minimizing the number of contacts and duration time spent \nwithin six feet of with other people. \n15.  Below I describe the guidance for each of these strategies, as they relate to \nclasses of individuals defined by their symptoms and possible exposure to COVID-19. \n// \n// \n  6 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-2   Filed 04/12/20   Page 8 of 17   Page ID\n #:5530\nSuspected cases with symptoms of COVID-19 \n16.  Reliance  on  a  testing  strategy  that  exclusively  tests  individuals  who  have \nCOVID-19 related symptoms creates delays in the identification of the initial (index) case and \nis inadequate to prevent the introduction and initial spread of COVID-19 to other detainees \nprior to the detection of an outbreak within the detention facility.  As noted above, many \nCOVID-19 infections are asymptomatic, and there is scientific consensus that individuals \nwithout symptoms are capable of transmitting COVID-19 to other people. Testing only those \nwith fever, SOB and cough substantially increases the likelihood missing infected individuals. \n17.  The specific laboratory test used to test samples collected at Adelanto is not \ndescribed, though is likely to be an rt-PCR test for coronavirus RNA collected from two \nswabs, of the posterior nasal passage and pharynx. Sensitivity of this testing approach is not \nprecisely known but is reported to be approximately 70% under using ideal sample collection \ntechnique and laboratory operating conditions. A sensitivity of 70% means that close to one \nthird (30%) of individuals with COVID-19 and symptoms. \n18.  Most experts, including myself, believe that under real-world conditions the \nsensitivity of rt-PCR on samples collected from 2 swabs is even lower than 70% (false positive \nrate is even higher than 30%), even among relatively sick individuals with multiple symptoms \nof modest to high severity. Emerging evidence suggests that sensitivity may also be lower in \nthe setting of more mild (less severe) symptoms, such as an individual with a cough who does \nnot have a fever nor shortness of breath. One practical implication of the low sensitivity of \nthe test (and the large number of false positives) is that a negative test result does not rule out \ninfection, and that individuals with suspected infection should be treated similarly, irrespective \n  7 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-2   Filed 04/12/20   Page 9 of 17   Page ID\n #:5531\nof the test result. That is, the individual with suspected infection (who by definition was \nsymptomatic) should remain in isolation until 7 days after the onset of symptoms, or three \ndays after their symptoms have resolved (whichever is longer); and anyone exposed to the \nperson with suspected infection should be quarantined for 14 days (unless they too are \nsymptomatic, in which case they are treated as a suspected case. \nIndividuals with positive test results  \n19.  According to the Valdez affidavit,  \nMedical isolation/quarantine is dependent on test results. A detainee suspected \nof having COVID-19 is placed alone in negative pressure room in the medical \ninfirmary.  A positive COVID-19 test result could require many days of isolation \n/ quarantine for the detainee depending on their symptoms…. [Valdez Para. \n20]  \n. . .  \n \nIf positive, the infected alien will remain in medical isolation for the duration of \nhis/her treatment. [Valdez Para 24] \n \n20.  Valdez is correct that a positive test should result in extension of the period of \nisolation, depending on the progression or resolution of symptoms.  However, Valdez is silent \nregarding the protocols triggered by a negative test result, either for the individual with \nsuspected COVID-19 her/himself, or for the other detainees in her/his housing group (who \nare eligible to form a ‘cohort’ in the case of a positive test result. \nIn relation to the individual with suspected COVID-19 who might receive a negative \ntest result, the Valdez affidavit states that:  \nAs of the date of this declaration, detainees at the APC have only had COVID-\n19 test results come back negative and the turnaround time on those tests have \nbeen 2-3 days.” [Valdez Para 20] \n  . . .  \n  8 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-2   Filed 04/12/20   Page 10 of 17   Page ID\n #:5532\nWhen there is a suspicion that an individual in a housing unit was exposed to \nCOVID-19, their housing unit is placed in modified programming pending the \nresults of the COVLD-19 test on the suspect detainee. [Valdez Para 23] \nThis appears to suggest that quarantine period will end, and the cohort can be \nreconstituted, as soon as a negative test result is received. \n21.  Individuals with suspected COVID-19 due to symptoms of fever, cough or \nshortness of breath, must be isolated from others – including members of his/her cohort – \nfor at least 3 days (72 hours) after resolution of all symptoms, even if a COVID-19 rt-PCR \ntest is negative. \n22.  CDC guidance provides two pathways to determine that individuals with \nconfirmed or suspected COVID—19 infections are not infectious: one option is to confirm \nCOVID-24 is no longer present, based on two (2) consecutive negative tests; the other \noption is to wait at least seven days since the onset of symptoms. Both options require that \nthe individual have improvement in their symptoms (cough and/or shortness of breath) and \nthat they be free from fever at least 72 hours: \n“For individuals who will be tested to determine if they are still contagious: \n•  The individual has been free from fever for at least 72 hours without the use of \nfever-reducing medications AND \n•  The individual's other symptoms have improved (e.g., cough, shortness of \nbreath) AND \n•  The  individual  has  tested  negative  in  at  least  two  consecutive  respiratory \nspecimens collected at least 24 hours apart \n \n“For individuals who will NOT be tested to determine if they are still contagious: \n•  The individual has been free from fever for at least 72 hours without the use of \nfever-reducing \nmedications AND \n•  The individual's other symptoms have improved (e.g., cough, shortness of \nbreath) AND \n•  At least 7 days have passed since the first symptoms appeared \n  9 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-2   Filed 04/12/20   Page 11 of 17   Page ID\n #:5533\n \n23.  The policy at Adelanto does not meet the (inadequate) standards set forth in the \nCDC guidance \nIndividuals quarantined due to exposure to a confirmed or suspected case of \nCOVID-19. \n24.  The frequency of symptom monitoring for individuals exposed to confirmed or \nsuspected cases is insufficient and does not meet CDC guidance.  \nIf the [detainee with COVID-19 symptoms] has been housed, his or her housing \nunit  will  be  placed  on  modified  programming  and  monitored  daily  with \ntemperature/symptom screenings until the results of the COVID-19 test is \nreceived. [Valdez Para 19]  \n \n25.  CDC guidance states that individuals who are quarantined (due to ‘close contact’ \nwith an individual with diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 infection) should be monitored \ntwice a day: “Quarantined individuals should be monitored for COVID-19 symptoms twice per day, \nincluding temperature checks.” [CDC Guidance in Detention] \n26.  Rationale: even relatively young healthy patients without known comorbid \nconditions can deteriorate rapidly when infected with COVID-19. This is well documented in \nmultiple studies from Asia, and by a growing base of evidence from communities in the U.S. \nsuch as New York. Anecdotal experience in Los Angeles is consistent with these studies: the \nisolation and quarantine unit where I work has witnessed clinically important deterioration \nover the course of several hours, and overnight, that necessitated admission to the hospital \nward or intensive care unit. Individuals under quarantine are presumed to be infected with \nCOVID-19 until they are removed from quarantine (because they met criteria listed above). \n// \n// \n  10 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-2   Filed 04/12/20   Page 12 of 17   Page ID\n #:5534\n“Cohorting” groups exposed to persons with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. \n27.  The Valdez and Janecka affidavits describe how groups of detainees who come \nin close contact with someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are treated similar, as \na group, or ‘cohorted’: \nIf a member of a housing group tests positive for COVID-19, then] “the \nhousing unit that was on modified programming… will become a cohort and \nwill  be  in  that  status  for  fourteen  days  unless  another  detainee  becomes \nsymptomatic which would then extend the cohort. [Valdez Para 24] \n \n28.  Although cohorting is endorsed by the CDC Guidance on Detention, the policy \nat Adelanto fails to meet the ideal conditions for quarantine, as articulated in the  CDC \nguidance in Detention Facilities. That Guidance explicitly states that confirmed cases and their \nclose contacts should, respectively, be isolated or quarantined individually: \nIdeally, cases should be isolated individually, and close contacts should be \nquarantined individually. However, some correctional facilities and detention \ncenters  do  not  have enough  individual  cells  to  do  so  and  must  consider \ncohorting as an alternative. \n \n29.  The preference for individual isolation/quarantine implicitly acknowledges the \npersistent risk of transmission when groups continue to share living space over time (as a \n‘cohort’). If individuals are cohorted together, all should wear masks.  CDC \nguidance states “If cohorted, quarantined individuals should wear face masks at all times (to \nprevent transmission from infected to uninfected individuals.” \n30.  The LA County COVID-19 Officer Orders also state that:  \nAll household contacts, intimate partners , caregivers, and close contacts who \nhave been in close contact with a person diagnosed with or likely to have \nCOVID-19… must quarantine themselves.  \n  11 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-2   Filed 04/12/20   Page 13 of 17   Page ID\n #:5535\n31.  Despite the modest adjustments made to increase ‘social distance’ between \ndetainees at Adelanto, it is exceedingly likely that most detainees within a given group (where \na group is defined by the individuals eligible to become a ‘cohort’ if a detainee is determined \nto have COVID-19) will spend more than 10 minutes in any 48-hour period within 6 feet of \nmost other detainees in their resident group. (It is also true that residents of Adelanto do not \nwear PPE all day every day -- nor should they).Because testing is conditional on having \nsymptoms of COVID-19, then if any resident of the group (for example, Resident A) is tested \nfor COVID-19, then most if not all members  of his or her group (Residents B through Z) \nwill meet the definition of a ‘close contact’, as articulated in the LA County Quarantine order: \nA person is considered to be a close contact of a person with or likely to have \nCOVID-19 if they (a) were within six (6) fee of a person who has or is likely to \nhave COVID-19 for more than ten (10) minutes or (b) who had unprotected \ncontact  with  the  body  fluids  and  /or  secretions  (such  as  being  coughed \non/sneezed on, shared utensils or saliva or provided care without wearing \nprotective equipment) of a person who has or is likely to have COVID-19, \nwithin 48 hours before that person’s symptoms began and until that person is \nno longer required to be isolated. \n32.  The CDC Guidance in Detention Facilities is less specific about the definition \nof who is considered “a close contact”: \nIn the context of COVID-19, an individual (incarcerated/detained person or \nstaff) is considered a close contact if they:  \no  Have been within approximately 6 feet of a COVID-19 case for a \nprolonged period of time OR  \no  Have had direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case \n(e.g., have been coughed on) \no  Close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing \na common space with a COVID-19 case [emphasis added]. Data to \ninform the definition of close contact are limited. Considerations when \nassessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g., longer \nexposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms \nof the person with COVID-19 (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure \nrisk, as does exposure to a severely ill patient). \n  12 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-2   Filed 04/12/20   Page 14 of 17   Page ID\n #:5536\nHigh risk individuals \n33.  Although COVID-19 can produce severe infection sufficient to kill healthy \nindividuals  at  any  age,  despite  timely  provision  of  intensive  care  including  mechanical \nventilation; the risk of severe disease and death is much higher for some people than for others. \nFactors used to identify individuals at high risk of severe disease and death include older age \n(especially over age 65, though risk appears to increase over a wide range of ages, and some \nhave suggested using alternative cutoff for age, such as 55 or 60), immunosuppressed states \ndue to HIV, cancer chemotherapy autoimmune disease therapy and other conditions, and \nmedical comorbidities including but not limited to diabetes, heart disease, asthma and COPD. \nI do not have access to the prevalence of these high-risk features among detainees at Adelanto, \nthough approximate estimates produced for similar detained populations, as well as the \nprevalence of these diseases in the United States and countries of origin of many immigrant \ndetainees, suggest that at least one third are likely to be either elderly or have comorbid \nconditions that place them at elevated risk of severe disease, hospitalization or death. \n34.  The Valdez and Janecka affidavits do not articulate a specific policy related to \ndetainees at high risk for severe disease and death, though the latter states: \n. . . to my knowledge ICE continues to release detainees who are identified as \nhigh risk as it relates to contraction of the COVID-19 virus.  [Janecka Para 19] \n35.  The reason for inclusion of paragraph #19 is unclear, though the statement \nwould seem to suggest that the GEO Group plays little to no role the identification of high-\nrisk detainees; and it suggests that it is unlikely that policies are in place in Adelanto to \nminimize COVID-19 risk specific to this high-risk group.  \n  13 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-2   Filed 04/12/20   Page 15 of 17   Page ID\n #:5537\n36.  The CDC Guidance on Detention articulates several policies related to high risk \nindividuals: \nIf the number of confirmed cases exceeds the number of individual medical \nisolation spaces available in the facility, be especially mindful of cases who are \nat higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. Ideally, they should not be \ncohorted with other infected individuals. If cohorting is unavoidable, make all \npossible accommodations to prevent transmission of other infectious diseases \nto the higher-risk individual. (For example, allocate more space for a higher-risk \nindividual within a shared medical isolation space.) \n \n•  Persons at higher risk may include older adults and persons of any age with \nserious underlying medical conditions such as lung disease, heart disease, \nand diabetes. See CDC's website for a complete list, and check regularly for \nupdates as more data become available to inform this issue. \n \n•  Note that incarcerated/detained populations have higher prevalence of \ninfectious and chronic diseases and are in poorer health than the general \npopulation, even at younger ages. \n \n37.  I have not seen evidence that officials at Adelanto are following the CDC \nGuidance related to high-risk individuals.  Although the CDC suggests being “especially \nmindful  of  cases  who  are  at  higher  risk  of  severe  illness,”  high  risk  individuals  are \nconspicuously absent from the Valdez and Janecka affidavits where are described practices \nrelated “cohorting,” and to the amount of space allocated for individuals in shared medical \nisolation rooms. The affidavits also are silent about contingency plans for high risk individuals \nif and when the number of confirmed cases exceeds the number of individual medical isolation \nspaces.  \n38.  The primary rationale to justify the enormous financial and societal cost of \ncontaining the spread of COVID-19 is to protect high risk individuals. Most “low risk” people \nwill survive our infections; many will not even be aware we are infected. \n  14 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-2   Filed 04/12/20   Page 16 of 17   Page ID\n #:5538\n \n39.  It is my professional opinion as a clinician and public health practitioner and \nresearcher that individuals at high risk for severe disease should be prioritized for release, and \nthat with rare exception they should not be detained. Until they can be released, or if release \nis not possible, then it is imperative that every  \nCleaning of living quarters by detainees \n40.  Based on declarations provided to me by the counsel for plaintiffs, it is my \nunderstanding that detainees are being forced to clean common areas. I further understand \nthat detainees are not provided with PPE to protect themselves during these cleaning episodes. \nThe process of wiping, scrubbing or otherwise removing virus particles from potentially \ncontaminated surfaces increases aerosolization of viral particles and increases risk of infection. \nAnyone cleaning these areas should be provided with PPE. \n41.  CDC Guidance states explicitly that cleaning of shared areas should be \nperformed by staff: \nStaff [emphasis added] should clean shared equipment several times per day and \non a conclusion of use basis (e.g., radios, service weapons, keys, handcuffs). \n[Please see “Cleaning and Disinfecting Practices” in that document] \n \n42. CDC Guidance further states: \n \n“All individuals who have the potential  for direct or indirect exposure to \nCOVID-19  cases  or  infectious  materials  (including…  contaminated \nenvironmental surfaces; or contaminated air) should follow infection control \npractices  outlined  in  the  CDC  Interim  Infection  Prevention  and  Control \nRecommendations  for  Patients  with  Suspected  or  Confirmed  Coronavirus \nDisease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings. Monitor these guidelines \nregularly for updates…. \n \n43.  CDC guidance explicitly states that the CDC Recommendations apply \nto detainees as well as staff in detention facilities: \n  15 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-2   Filed 04/12/20   Page 17 of 17   Page ID\n #:5539\nNote  that  these  recommendations  apply  to  staff  as  well  as  to \nincarcerated/detained individuals who may come in contact with contaminated \nmaterials  during  the  course  of  their  work  placement  in  the  facility  (e.g., \ncleaning). \n \n44.  Based on the declarations of the GEO employee and ICE representative, the \npolicies and procedures at Adelanto fail to comport with the ‘ideal’ suite of conditions outlined \nin the CDC guidance, and best practices endorsed by the scientific community. \n45.  GEO’s  decision  to  require  detained  immigrants  to  continue  cleaning  and \ndisinfecting common areas inside their dorms and pods at Adelanto without providing them \npersonal protective equipment, adequate sanitization and disinfectant supplies, and adequate \naccess to soap, hot water, and paper towels places Class Members at Adelanto at an increased \nrisk of contracting, becoming ill, and potentially dying from COVID-19, as well as spreading \nthe virus if they are asymptomatic carriers.  \n46.  By failing to provide these basic needs and requiring Class Members to clean, \ndisinfect, and sanitizer their common living areas without adequate supplies, GEO exposes \nthem to a heightened risk of serious illness or death.  \n \nDated:  April 11, 2020 \n \n \n______________________________ \nAdam Richards, MD PhD MPH \n \n  16 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-3   Filed 04/12/20   Page 1 of 2   Page ID\n #:5540\n \n \n \n \nEXHIBIT C \n\nCCaassee 5 5:2:107-c-cvv-0-002659164-T-JJGHB-J-DSHE K   D  Docoucmumenetn 4t -216  0 F-3il e  dF i0le4d/0 054/2/102  / 2P0a g  eP a1g oef  21  o  fP 2a g  eP aIDge # I:D92\n #:5541\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-4   Filed 04/12/20   Page 1 of 2   Page ID\n #:5542\n \n \n \n \nEXHIBIT D \n\nCCaassee 5 5:2:107-c-cvv-0-002751164-T-JJGHB-S-SPH   KD  o Dcuomcuemnte 8n-t3 2  6 F0i-l4e d   F0i4le/0d8 0/240/1  2 P/2a0g e   P1a ogfe 8 25  o  fP 2a g  eP aIDge # I:D70\n #:5543\nMy name is Jairo Guardado Aparicio and I am over 18 years old and the following is my declaration is \ntruth and correct to the best of my knowledge \n1.  My name is Jairo Antonio Guardado Aparicio \n2.  I am from El Salvador. \n3.  I am 37 years old and I first entered in 6/2009 and never left. \n4.  I was inside the car on 6/11/2019 in the parking garage and was about to drive out, there were 8 \nto 10 people in another cars stopped me. They pulled out the gun and stopped my car.  I was \npulled out from my car and they arrested me.  They did not tell me the reason and there was no \narrest warrant as well. \n5.  They sent me to the Federal Building and then to Adelanto Detention Center since that time. \n6.  The immigration Judge denied my bond request in 2019 .. \n7.  I filed a petition for review with the 9th circuit court of appeal after the Board ofthe Immigration \nAppeals was denied on March, 2020. \n8.  I have a pain in the neck and there is a lump in my neck.  The lump pressures my head and I have \nheadache as a result of that. They sent me twice to the hospital to have X-ray.  The most recent \ntime for that X-ray was two weeks ago \n9.  They only gave me pain medication Tylenol only at this time. \n10. I also see a psychologist because I have anxiety problem. \n11. I have flu and itchy throat since last Friday.  I have dry cough as well since that time.  I also have \nfever. They did not test me for any medication condition but gave me a mask to wear. \n12. As the Covid 19 spreads everywhere in the world including California, Adelanto Detention \nCenter did not provide any procedure to help or protect us.  I still sleep in the same bedroom \nwith only few feet apart from my next cellmate.  Besides, there is no masks, gloves or any \nsanitizer provides to any of us to protect us.  They only provided me one mask despite my \nmedical condition and no medication.  I know the mask is only good for one day and there is no \nnew mask to provide me. \n13. I feel very helpless and vulnerable under this circumstance and I am so afraid of my live if I \ncontinue to stay inside.  I know sooner or later I will get that coronavirus because of my medical \nproblem and no protection from the ICE detention. I don't believe Adelanto Detention Center \nprovides any test site to test anyone who has the symptoms. The bedroom and the bathroom \nare very dirty and not sanitizing.  It is scary.  I am very afraid I will die there if I do not get out. \n14. I need to get out from there since my case is pending and my medical problem and I have no \ncriminal record. \n15.

In the past two weeks, COVID-19 has entered into correctional \n5  facilities, including numerous ICE detention centers, as predicted. ICE reports that, \n6  as of April 7, there have been 19  detained people in 11 facilities, 11 ICE \n7  employees in 6 facilities, and 60 ICE employees not assigned to a facility who \n8  have all tested positive for COVID-19.1 This is likely just the tip of the iceberg in \n9  terms of the number of ICE staff and detainees who are already infected but are \n10  unaware due to the lack of testing nationwide, and the fact that people who are \n11  infected can be asymptomatic for several days. \n12  2.  New information about the transmissibility of COVID-19 has also \n13  been revealed that is relevant to the health of ICE detainees and staff. \n14  a.  COVID-19 appears to be transmissible through aerosolized fecal \n15  contact. This is relevant because the plume of aerosolized fecal \n16  material that occurs when a toilet is flushed is not addressable by \n17  closing the lid of ICE detainee toilets, which lack a lid. This mode of \n18  transmission would pose a threat to anyone sharing a cell with a \n19  person who has COVID-19 and could occur before a person becomes \n20  symptomatic. This mode of transmission could also extend beyond \n21  cellmates, especially in circumstances where common bathrooms exist \n22  or where open communication between cells exists.2 \n23  b.  CDC and state guidelines now recommend the use of protective masks \n24  for anyone who is in close contact with others, at less than 6 feet \n25 \n \n26 \n1 ICE Guidance on COVID-19, IMMIGRATION & CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT (Updated \nApr. 3, 2020), https://www.ice.gov/coronavirus. \n27 \n2 https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/85315 \n28 \n  1 \n \n \n \n\nCCaassee  55::1197--ccvv--0012554164--JJGGBB--SSHHKK      DDooccuummeenntt  121630--25      FFiilleedd  0044//0192//2200      PPaaggee  45  ooff  1178      PPaaggee  IIDD\n  ##::15858428\n \n1  distance.3 This recommendation would apply to staff and detainees \n2  alike. \n3  c.  The rate of COVID-19 infection spread in correctional settings is \n4  extremely rapid. The data from the NYC jail system reveal that in the \n5  space of two weeks, the facility went from zero confirmed infections, \n6  to 2, then 38, then 574.4   \n7 \nCOVID-19 in NYC Jails (all + tests) \n8 \n500\n450\n9 \n400\n350\n10 \n300\n11  250\n200\n12  150\n100\n13 \n50\n0\n14 \n15 \n16  This rapid rate of increase in COVID-19 infections in detention \n17  settings has overwhelmed local hospitals and required the deployment \n18  of National Guard troops in several states to supplement the lack of \n19  staffing and resources.5 This rapid spread has also resulted in up to \n20  half of all detained people and housing areas in a given facility being \n21  placed into quarantine as each new case emerges and the close \n22   \n3 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-\n23  cover.html \n4 Board of Correction Daily Covid-19 Update, NEW YORK BD.

For facilities \n2  operating at over 75 percent of capacity, this process will be \n3  essentially impossible as newly identified cases require initiating \n4  quarantine areas for a prescribed 14-day period and housing areas are \n5  not available for these date-based cohorts. The consequence will be \n6  either a) mixing of different quarantine cohorts, which will not only \n7  extend the effective quarantine period past 14 days but also increase \n8  the spread of potentially infected people from different areas of the \n9  facility, or b) failure to establish quarantine cohorts all together, \n10  meaning that close contacts of cases will remain mixed with other \n11  detainees, also increasing the spread of COVID-19 throughout the \n12  facility. \n13  ICE Guidelines Contradict or Omit Several Important CDC Guidelines \n14  3.  I have reviewed ICE’s March 6 and March 27, 2020 documents \n15  addressing COVID-19, as well as declarations by ICE Captain Moon and IHSC \n16  Physician Rivera and the webpage that ICE has established concerning COVID-19. \n17  I have also reviewed the April 4, 2020 guidance from ICE Enforcement and \n18  Removal Operations. Collectively, these policies continue to be deficient and at \n19  odds with recommendations of the CDC regarding detention settings in a manner \n20  that threatens the health and survival of ICE detainees. \n21  a.  ICE protocols and guidance fail to address the key recommendation of \n22  the CDC on the need for adequate intake screening of detainees. CDC \n23  guidance makes clear that everyone arriving in a detention facility \n24  should be screened for signs and symptom of COVID-19, but ICE \n25  protocols rely on questions about travel or other known contacts as a \n26  precursor to temperature checks and other sign and symptom checks. \n27  ICE protocols and guidance also fail to clearly mandate that all \n28 \n  3 \n \n \n \n\nCCaassee  55::1197--ccvv--0012554164--JJGGBB--SSHHKK      DDooccuummeenntt  121630--25      FFiilleedd  0044//0192//2200      PPaaggee  67  ooff  1178      PPaaggee  IIDD\n  ##::15858540\n \n1  symptomatic patients be immediately given a mask and placed in \n2  medical isolation, and that all staff who have further contact with that \n3  patient wear personal protective equipment, as set forth in the CDC \n4  guidelines. The ICE protocol also fails to address the now-standard \n5  CDC advice that everyone who cannot engage in social distancing \n6  wear a face covering.6 \n7  b.  ICE protocols and guidance fail to address the key recommendation of \n8  the CDC on the need for monitoring and care of symptomatic patients.  \n9  i.  The CDC guidelines make clear that patients who exhibit \n10  symptoms of COVID-19 should be immediately placed in \n11  medical isolation. ICE guidelines and protocols only invoke this \n12  response for newly arrived detainees who also answered yes on \n13  screening questions. This approach results in a failure to \n14  actively screen the large majority of detainees: people who are \n15  already detained.  \n16  ii.  CDC guidelines clearly indicate the need for twice-daily \n17  monitoring of patients who are symptomatic or in quarantine, \n18  and ICE only mandates a daily check. \n19  iii.  ICE makes no mention of access to masks for patients in \n20  quarantine settings. \n21  iv.   ICE fails to present a plan for how isolation will be conducted \n22  when the number of people exceeds the number of existing \n23  isolation rooms or cells. This is almost certain to occur in the \n24  coming weeks at multiple facilities.  \n25 \n26 \n \n27  6 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-\ncoverings.html \n28 \n  4 \n \n \n \n\nCCaassee  55::1197--ccvv--0012554164--JJGGBB--SSHHKK      DDooccuummeenntt  121630--25      FFiilleedd  0044//0192//2200      PPaaggee  78  ooff  1178      PPaaggee  IIDD\n  ##::15858551\n \n1  c.  ICE protocols and guidance fail to address the key recommendation of \n2  the CDC on the need for social distancing. ICE's March 27 memo \n3  mentions social distancing briefly, but fails to address how ICE \n4  facilities will enact modified meal or recreation times and also fails to \n5  address the most common scenarios in which high risk detainees find \n6  themselves in close quarters, including shared cells, medication lines, \n7  bathroom facilities, common walkways and day rooms, sally ports and \n8  transportation. This critical issue is also ignored in the declarations of \n9  Captain Moon. Again, because there is no cure for COVID-19, social \n10  distancing remains the most effective means of prevention, and ICE \n11  has failed to meaningfully implement this precaution into its guidance.  \n12  d.  ICE protocols and guidance fail to address the key recommendation of \n13  the CDC on the need to limit transportation of detainees as a means to \n14  limit the spread of COVID-19. CDC guidelines state that transfers \n15  should be limited to those that are absolutely necessary and that \n16  receiving facilities must have capacity to isolate symptomatic patients \n17  upon arrival. ICE protocols and guidance fails to address these issues. \n18  CDC guidelines make clear the need for a clear plan for all aspects of \n19  transport of suspected COVID-19 infected people, and ICE does not \n20  have or report such a plan. This critical issue is also ignored in the \n21  declarations of Captain Moon.  \n22  e.  ICE protocols and guidance fail to address the key recommendation of \n23  the CDC on the need for environmental cleaning of both housing \n24  areas and other common spaces within facilities. CDC guidelines \n25  provide clear details about the types of cleaning agents and cleaning \n26  processes that should be employed, while ICE provide no guidance to \n27  facilities on this critical issue. The declarations of Captain Moon that \n28 \n  5 \n \n \n \n\nCCaassee  55::1197--ccvv--0012554164--JJGGBB--SSHHKK      DDooccuummeenntt  121630--25      FFiilleedd  0044//0192//2200      PPaaggee  89  ooff  1178      PPaaggee  IIDD\n  ##::15858562\n \n1  state generally that ICE is providing adequate environmental cleaning \n2  stand in stark contrast to the declarations of detainees to the contrary, \n3  cited in my previous report. The reliance on detainees for conducting \n4  critical environmental cleaning, without proper training, protection or \n5  supervision, represents a gross deviation from correctional practices, \n6  and will likely contribute to the spread of COVID-19 throughout the \n7  ICE detention system.  \n8  f.  ICE protocols and guidance fail to address the key recommendation of \n9  the CDC on the need for adequate staffing and training of staff. ICE’s \n10  March 27 memo simply states that “facilities are expected to be \n11  appropriately staffed,” but provides no guidance whatsoever on how \n12  that can be accomplished in the context of existing staffing gaps, a \n13  decreased workforce, and increased needs resulting from steps \n14  required to screen, monitor and treat detainees for COVID-19. CDC \n15  guidelines make clear the need for a concrete plan for ensuring \n16  adequate staffing as part of the COVID-19 response. These guidelines \n17  also make clear the need to orient staff to the critical need to stay \n18  home if and when they experience symptoms of COVID-19 infection. \n19  In sum, aside from its March 27 “expectation” of appropriate staffing \n20  levels, ICE has not implemented any meaningful oversight system to \n21  ensure that staffing levels are appropriate. Critically, appropriate \n22  staffing levels refers not only to a sufficient number of staff but also \n23  to a sufficient number of qualified staff. In my experience, many \n24  facilities rely heavily on guards and LPNs to do medical work that \n25  they are not qualified to do; likewise, many facilities rely on RNs to \n26  do medical work that only doctors or physician-assistants are qualified \n27  to do. There is no indication whatsoever that ICE is implementing \n28 \n  6 \n \n \n \n\nCCaassee 5 5:1:179--ccvv--0021551446--JJGGBB--SSHHKK     D Dooccuummeennt t2 16103--52     F Filieledd 0 044/1/029/2/200     P Paaggee 1 90 o of f1 178     P Paaggee I DID\n  ##::15858573\n \n1  procedures to ensure not only sufficient numbers of staff but also \n2  sufficient numbers of qualified staff. The declaration of Dr. Rivera \n3  confirms that ICE is relying on an emergency staffing plan from 2014, \n4  updated in 2017, but the current shortages in staffing for health staff \n5  in particular, stretch across all communities, and staffing shortages \n6  represent a real emergency in many settings already. This is \n7  particularly concerning given that many ICE facilities are located in \n8  rural areas far from qualified medical professionals. This is a very \n9  serious defect that must be immediately remediated because access to \n10  qualified medical professionals is crucial during this rapidly evolving \n11  pandemic.    \n12  g.  Several CDC guidelines address people with factors that put them at \n13  an increased risk of significant injury or death, but the ICE protocols \n14  do not even identify what precautions should be taken to protect \n15  people with those risk factors in ICE custody. In addition, the Apr. 4 \n16  list of risk factors for serious illness and death from COVID-19 \n17  infection developed by ICE is inconsistent with CDC guidelines and \n18  fails to adequately advise facilities on which detainees are at elevated \n19  risk. This list is included in a memo to Field Office Directors \n20  regarding Docket Review, and fails to include very basic risk factors \n21  identified by the CDC, including body mass index over 40 and being a \n22  current or former smoker.7 By apparently assigning this process to \n23  field directors and their staff, who are not medical professionals, \n24  advising security staff to check with medical professionals after the \n25  fact, and failing to include CDC-identified risk factors, this docket \n26 \n \n27  7 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/groups-at-\nhigher-risk.html And https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6913e2.htm.  \n28 \n  7 \n \n \n \n\nCCaassee  55::1197--ccvv--0012554164--JJGGBB--SSHHKK      DDooccuummeenntt  121630--25      FFiilleedd  0044//0192//2200      PPaaggee  1101  ooff  1178      PPaaggee  IIDD\n  ##::15858584\n \n1  review process will likely leave many people with true risk factors in \n2  detention. This is particularly the case if they’re detained under \n3  certain immigration law provisions, where the guidance recommends \n4  officers not release them despite risks. Thus, the guidance appears to \n5  be just that – guidance, and the risk factors are not determinative. In \n6  fact, the guidance appears to not make these risk factors determinative \n7  for release—even for people who are not subject to mandatory \n8  detention. ICE also identifies people under that age of 60 in this \n9  cohort but the age of 55 is appropriate. Because detained people have \n10  consistently been identified as having higher levels of health problems \n11  that reflect 10-15 years more progressed than chronological age, \n12  numerous organizations and research studies have used the age of 55 \n13  to define the lower limit of older detainees.8 ICE also limits the high \n14  risk period for women to 2 weeks after child birth, yet one of the most \n15  serious increased risk during pregnancy is hypercoagulable state, \n16  which increases the risk of blood clots in the large veins of the lower \n17  extremities, and sometimes in the lung which can prove fatal. This \n18  risk extends to 6 weeks post-partum and also occurs independently \n19  with COVID-19 infection.9 Accordingly, ICE should include these \n20  definitions in its list of risk factors. ICE should also put in place a \n21  mechanism to ensure that risk factors reflect the evolving science and \n22  data concerning COVID-19, since it is likely that additional risk \n23  factors will emerge as more data is collected.

Numerous and significant failures of the ICE response to COVID-19 \n8  also exist in areas in which the CDC does not provide direct guidance, but that \n9  detention facilities must implement. These failures threaten the health and survival \n10  of ICE detainees. \n11  a.  Neither the ICE COVID-19 protocols nor the declarations set forth \n12  any policies or protocols addressing release of medically vulnerable \n13  detained people in light of the significant risks to those people posed \n14  by COVID-19. This must be done immediately and is in contrast to \n15  the efforts made in many prison and jail systems across the country. \n16  The Apr. 4 promulgation of an incomplete list of risk factors in a \n17  memo relating to discretion for release occurs in a complete vacuum \n18  of guidance on special protection and clinical management of people \n19  with those risk factors while in detention. This Memo describes an \n20  overly discretionary decisionmaking process for release that does not \n21  sufficiently favor depopulation as public health requires and that has \n22  no urgency to it. Reviews and releases must be undertaken \n23  immediately. \n24  b.  ICE does not have any mechanisms to monitor or promote the health \n25  of all people in its charge. This failure is documented in many reports \n26  about ICE’s inadequate healthcare system, but now poses a grave risk \n27  to their survival as ICE struggles to mount a competent response to \n28 \n  9 \n \n \n \n\nCCaassee  55::1197--ccvv--0012554164--JJGGBB--SSHHKK      DDooccuummeenntt  121630--25      FFiilleedd  0044//0192//2200      PPaaggee  1123  ooff  1178      PPaaggee  IIDD\n  ##::15859506\n \n1  COVID-19 across more than 150 facilities, on behalf of roughly \n2  40,000 detainees and almost as many direct and contract staff. The \n3  declaration of Dr. Rivera reflects that no incident command system is \n4  in place to manage this response, and reporting and communication \n5  among direct and contract health and security leadership of the ICE \n6  detention system occurs in a fragmented, one-way, or as-needed basis.  \n7  i.  ICE’s March 27 memo takes the dangerous approach of \n8  limiting clinical guidelines for COVID-19 response to the \n9  detainees being provided direct care by ICE health services \n10  corps (IHSC) staff, which represents approximately 13,000 \n11  detainees.10 As a result, detention centers operated by public \n12  and private contractors are not provided with this guidance. \n13  This approach to management of the COVID-19 outbreak \n14  ensures that vital information will remain in these facilities, \n15  instead of being acted upon by ICE. As a result, ICE will not \n16  know when its own policies or even basic standard of infection \n17  control are being followed. ICE's failure to properly monitor \n18  and oversee medical care at its detention centers has been a \n19  chronic concern in the health services provided to ICE \n20  detainees prior to this outbreak and has been cited as a core \n21  failure of ICE in its obligations to establish quality assurance \n22  throughout its detention network.11 There is no indication that \n23  ICE can adequately monitor the response across its system to \n24  COVID-19. Absent robust and centralized oversight, ICE will \n25 \n \n10 https://www.ice.gov/ice-health-service-corps and  \n26 \n11 https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2019-02/OIG-19-18-Jan19.pdf \n27  And https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2019-06/OIG-19-47-\nJun19.pdf \n28 \n  10 \n \n \n \n\nCCaassee  55::1197--ccvv--0012554164--JJGGBB--SSHHKK      DDooccuummeenntt  121630--25      FFiilleedd  0044//0192//2200      PPaaggee  1134  ooff  1178      PPaaggee  IIDD\n  ##::15859517\n \n1  not be able to provide a coordinated response informed by on-\n2  the-ground data from detention centers. This is in stark contrast \n3  to many prison systems across the country that are coordinating \n4  their efforts, including with health departments.  \n5  ii.  ICE has no plan or even capacity to provide daily clinical \n6  guidance to all of the clinical staff it relies on to care for ICE \n7  detainees, whether at ICE-operated facilities or contract \n8  facilities. This is a core failure because of the new nature of \n9  COVID-19 and constantly changing clinical guidance on how \n10  to treat patients. Daily briefings with health administrators and \n11  medical and nursing leadership should be held, which are both a \n12  core aspect of outbreak management and provide a critical \n13  avenue for receiving feedback on real-time conditions inside \n14  facilities. ICE has not articulated any plan to ensure that this \n15  type of basic communication is in place across its network of \n16  detention settings. This guidance should also include uniform \n17  recommendations on when and how to transport patients to the \n18  hospital. Failure to implement this kind of procedure—\n19  particularly in light of the other defects described herein—poses \n20  a significant risk to the health and lives ICE detainees.  \n21  iii.  ICE has failed to establish the type of COVID-19 surveillance \n22  that is required to manage their COVID-19 response. Because \n23  ICE is responsible for approximately 40,000 lives inside over \n24  150 facilities, with a wide variety of contract and administration \n25  types, ICE leadership, namely the IHSC, must establish a \n26  competent surveillance system for COVID-19 that includes, at a \n27  minimum, a dashboard reflecting critical and real-time \n28 \n  11 \n \n \n \n\nCCaassee  55::1197--ccvv--0012554164--JJGGBB--SSHHKK      DDooccuummeenntt  121630--25      FFiilleedd  0044//0192//2200      PPaaggee  1145  ooff  1178      PPaaggee  IIDD\n  ##::15859528\n \n1  information for clinical cases and facility resources. A \n2  dashboard is a collection of real time data used to manage \n3  healthcare and other operations, and COVID-19 dashboards are \n4  now used by every state and the federal government to manage \n5  their day to day resource and clinical responses to this \n6  pandemic.12 My experience during H1N1 when my team and I \n7  needed to create an outbreak dashboard for 13 jails holding \n8  15,000 patients was that we were able to design and implement \n9  this approach in a 3-4 week timeline, but that we established \n10  data streams from hotspots and most impacted facilities within \n11  a week. This approach for ICE would include, but not be \n12  limited to the following variables and would be utilized by \n13  IHSC leadership to track each individual facility and then roll \n14  up to State, regional and national dashboards; \n15  Clinical Surveillance (number of detainees) \n \n16  Number of  Number  Number positive  Number of  Number of patients  Number of patients \nsymptomati awaiting/receive tests (w and w/o  detainees in  awaiting/in/returne awaiting/in/returne\nc (w and  d tests (w and  CDC risk factors)  quarantine  d from hospital for  d from hospital for \n17 \nw/o CDC  w/o CDC risk  (w and w/o  COVID-19 (w and  COVID-19(w and \nrisk factors)  factors)  CDC risk  w/o CDC risk  w/o CDC risk \n18 \nfactors)  factors)  factors) \nquarantine*  \n19 \n13 \nResource allocation \n20 \n \nDeficit in  Deficit in  PPE deficits by  Cleaning,  Sinks and other  Restrictions in \n21 \nsecurity  nursing/mid- masks/gowns/glove soap, hand  plumbing not  local hospital \nFTE  level/MD FTE  s etc.  sanitizer  operational   beds14 \n22 \n23   \n12 Example of FL State COVID-19 dashboard \n24  https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/96dd742462124fa0b38ddedb9b25e429. \n13 An additional data mandate for every facility is to create a histograms that shows \n25 \nthe number of people in quarantine for each of the 14 days, so that the facility, \nState, regional and national data can show the trends in quarantine and new cases. \n26 \n14 Many correctional facilities are already experiencing restrictions from local \n27  hospitals. Some local hospitals have informed detention centers that they will only \naccept COVID-19 patients, while others have restricted all access. \n28 \n  12 \n \n \n \n\nCCaassee  55::1197--ccvv--0012554164--JJGGBB--SSHHKK      DDooccuummeenntt  121630--25      FFiilleedd  0044//0192//2200      PPaaggee  1156  ooff  1178      PPaaggee  IIDD\n  ##::15859539\n \n1  supply \ndeficits \n2   \nThis centralized surveillance is absolutely necessary in COVID-\n3 \nresponse. On the clinical side, some local hospitals have already \n4 \nclosed their doors to incarcerated patients and the lack of access \n5 \nof ICE patients to hospital-level care (such as intensive care \n6 \nbeds and respiratory rehabilitation) should be a core concern for \n7 \nICE--not one that can be resolved by local facilities alone.  On \n8 \nthe resource side, the staffing requirements are extremely acute \n9 \nin detention settings and the deployment of the Ohio National \n10 \nGuard in a prison in Ohio should trigger immediate high-level \n11 \nreview of staffing, PPE and other resources issues across the \n12 \nICE network. ICE’s surveillance system must also account for \n13 \nthe availability of hospital beds and intensive care unit beds (as \n14 \nwell as other hospital-level equipment, such as ventilators, that \n15 \nare lacking in facilities but crucial for COVID-19 treatment). \n16 \nCurrently ICE appears not to provide this kind of crucial \n17 \nsurveillance and coordination. In addition, many patients will \n18 \nrequire nursing home placement in subacute care settings, a \n19 \nresource traditionally inaccessible to most ICE detainees \n20 \nbecause of their lack of insurance status. Absent tracking of this \n21 \nkind of crucial data, ICE will not be able to ensure that \n22 \nindividuals in its custody have access to life-saving medical \n23 \ncare. One critical measure in assessing staffing is to measure \n24 \nthe staffing deficit (unmet need) to perform the work of the \n25 \nfacility, not use the baseline staffing matrix. If a facility has \n26 \n1,000 detainees and regularly employs 150 security staff, 5 \n27 \n28 \n  13 \n \n \n \n\nCCaassee  55::1197--ccvv--0012554164--JJGGBB--SSHHKK      DDooccuummeenntt  121630--25      FFiilleedd  0044//0192//2200      PPaaggee  1167  ooff  1178      PPaaggee  IIDD\n  ##::15859640\n \n1  physicians and 25 nurses across three shifts, by example, the \n2  arrival of COVID-19 in the facility will require significantly \n3  more work to be done, with additional security and nursing staff \n4  working in quarantine units and medical clinics particularly, \n5  and additional security staff needed to enable social distancing, \n6  which is a labor intensive process.   \n7  iv.  The Apr. 4 ICE memo to Field Directors on identification and \n8  release of detained people with risk factors for serious illness \n9  and death from COVID-19 infection is both incomplete and \n10  revelatory. ICE has omitted multiple important risk factors \n11  identified by the CDC in its own list, but has also failed to \n12  create any surveillance of the outbreak across facilities that \n13  includes the number of patients experiencing symptoms, \n14  confirmed COVID-19 infection or hospitalization by presence \n15  or absence of CDC risk factors.  \n16  5.  As ICE determines to release people from detention, they should be \n17  afforded symptom screening akin to what is done with staff, but the release of \n18  detainees to the community will lower their own risks of infection and will also \n19  serve to flatten the overall epidemic curve by decreasing the rate of new infections \n20  and the demands on local hospital systems. From a medical and epidemiologic \n21  standpoint, people are safer from COVID-19 infection when not detained, and the \n22  epidemic curve of COVID-19 on the general community is flattened by having \n23  fewer people detained.  \n24  6.

If called as a witness, I could and would testify competently and truthfully to these \nmatters. \n2.  The Southeast Immigrant Freedom Initiative (“SIFI”) represents people confined inside \nseveral immigrant detention centers operated by GEO Group: the Folkston ICE Processing Center \n(“Folkston”) in Folkston, Georgia; the LaSalle Detention Center (“LaSalle”) in Jena, Louisiana; \nPine Prairie ICE Processing Center (“Pine Prairie”) in Pine Prairie, Louisiana; and, to a lesser \nextent, the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center (“South Louisiana”) in Basile, Louisiana.  \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-6   Filed 04/12/20   Page 3 of 6   Page ID\n #:5564\n3.  I serve as a Lead Attorney for the SIFI’s Folkston Office. Since the outbreak of the novel \ncoronavirus,  SIFI  staff  and  I  have  visited  and  spoken  by  phone  or  video  conference  with \nindividuals in Folkston.  \n4.  The paragraphs below reflect what SIFI staff and I have personally witnessed and learned \nin recent weeks in conversation with people inside Folkston.  \n5.  As early as March 17, 2020, media outlets reported that Charlton County, where Folkston \nis located, had a confirmed case of coronavirus in the region.1 Yesterday, on April 9, 2020, Reuters \nreported that GEO Group confirmed Folkston had a COVID-19 positive employee.2  \n6.  To date, the GEO Group has prevented people inside Folkston from practicing social \ndistancing—the  only  known  means  of  preventing  transmission—by  continuing  to  confine \nindividuals in groups of dozens or larger. It has failed to provide personal protective equipment to \nthe people it is paid to care for. It has not given people inside these detention centers adequate \ninformation about protection against contracting COVID-19.  \n7.  The group setting at Folkston deprives detained people of the ability to practice social \ndistancing safety measures. On March 25, I personally observed about 50-60 men sitting within \ninches of each other while waiting for their court hearings. Based on my experience representing \nindividuals at Folkston and visiting clients there on a regular basis for more than two years, this \nwas nothing out of the ordinary. \n8.  I have spoken with individuals detained at Folkston about whether they were able to \nmaintain six feet of distance from other residents and whether they had resources to exercise \n \n1 Gordon Jackson, Folkston coronavirus case confirmed, Brunswick News, Mar. 17, 2020, \navailable at https://thebrunswicknews.com/news/local_news/folkston-coronavirus-case-\nconfirmed/article_79dd9c5d-f2dc-554b-8993-1ae66bcd127f.html (last visited Apr. 10, 2020). \n2 Mica Rosenberg (@micarosenberg) Twitter (Apr. 9, 2020, 10:46 PM), \nhttps://twitter.com/micarosenberg/status/1248442140537077760.  \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-6   Filed 04/12/20   Page 4 of 6   Page ID\n #:5565\nhygienic and other precautions in their living quarters. One individual told me he was housed in a \ncell with seven other people, which adjoined to a common area where up to 60 people congregate \nat once on a regular basis. Another told me his bunk was in a dorm with approximately 32 people \nsleeping in the same room and sharing three sinks. Both individuals told me that detainees are still \nresponsible for cleaning the facility during the pandemic and that maintaining a six-foot distance \nfrom others throughout the day and night is not possible. \n9.  Several individuals detained in Folkston have reported to SIFI staff that they do not have \nhand soap or sanitizer in their housing units, and that all they have is body shampoo to use in the \nshower. I personally observed on two days in March that detained individuals did not have masks \nor gloves. Individuals have reported that staff at Folkston do not wear masks and that many do not \nwear gloves. In March, I personally observed that none of the detention center employees were \nwearing masks, although I noticed that some had a mask near them. \n10.  Individuals detained at Folkston have reported to SIFI staff that the facility has posted \nsigns about COVID-19 in shared spaces, but that they remain confused about steps the facility is \ntaking to keep them safe. \n11.  Individuals detained at Folkston have reported that measures to contain the spread of \nillness are insufficient. For example, on April 8, an individual reported to SIFI staff that two \npeople in their unit who had a high fever were given painkillers and returned to the unit. Another \nindividual reported to SIFI staff that within the past two weeks, a detainee who was exhibiting \nsymptoms and sought medical treatment was not taken seriously until he vomited and collapsed in \nthe bathroom.  \n12.  Individuals detained at Folkston have reported to SIFI staff that Folkston staff has \nadvised detainees to be careful and try to stay away from each other, but that living in close \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-6   Filed 04/12/20   Page 5 of 6   Page ID\n #:5566\nquarters makes it impossible for them to do so. Individuals detained at Folkston have advised SIFI \nstaff that many of the people detained there have flu-like symptoms, but continue to be housed in \nclose quarters with other detained people. \n13.  The facility’s failure to implement adequate safety measures in response to the COVID-\n19 pandemic is reflective of its history of deficient medical care. Throughout the time I have \nrepresented individuals in Folkston, I have heard complaints about the quality of medical care. \nWithin the last two years, residents have reported waiting up to eight days to see a doctor after \nrequesting a medical appointment, receiving substandard care, and having their medical concerns \ndismissed or ridiculed by medical staff as “dramatic.” Residents with serious medical conditions \nhave gotten sicker because meals provided by the detention center do not comply with their \nmedical dietary needs. I have heard reports of detention center staff creating records that residents \nrefused their medication when, in fact, the medication was not distributed. I have heard about \nstacks of unfulfilled medical requests being found in the trash.  \n14.  I am aware of at least two incidents in the last two years where a resident who was \nexhibiting obvious signs of severe medical distress was ignored by detention center staff until \nother residents essentially staged a protest, as well as other medical emergencies that were not \nadequately addressed. In 2018, an individual who was experiencing excruciating abdominal pain \nwas not immediately taken to an emergency room despite multiple urgent requests from the \nresident and his attorney. Detention center employees assured the resident and his attorney that he \nwas fine. The man’s appendix later ruptured. \n15.  Since January of 2018, there have been multiple outbreaks of communicable disease \nwithin Folkston, including chickenpox and other potentially serious illnesses. One individual \ndetained at Folkston shared with me that he tested positive for tuberculosis (“TB”) after he was \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-6   Filed 04/12/20   Page 6 of 6   Page ID\n #:5567\nassigned to a cell with a roommate exhibiting visible symptoms of an active TB infection. The \nroommate was subsequently confirmed to have TB. As of the date of this declaration, SIFI staff \nknows of at least one individual at Folkston who is currently receiving treatment for TB infection. \n16.  Today, April 10, 2020, I am conducting in-person visitation at Folkston in spite of the \nconfirmed case of a GEO Group employee so that I can fulfill my ethical obligations. Although \nSIFI has sought to minimize in-person visits by relying on the mail, phone calls, and video \nteleconference calls, these methods have proven insufficient to timely gathering paper documents \nand signatures from people inside Folkston. Having waited an undue number of days for return \nmail to arrive from Folkston, I may no longer delay the fulfillment of my ethical responsibilities, \nso I must visit the facility in person. \n17.  Based on our experience representing GEO’s actions in requiring Class Members to \nperform mandatory cleaning duties without adequate PPE and cleaning supplies puts people \nimprisoned at Folkston at an elevated risk of contracting the infection. An order requiring GEO to \ncease forcing Class Members to uphold GEO’s contractual responsibility -- keeping the facility \nclean and sanitary -- would immediately reduce this risk. I fear that in the absence of immediate \naction from GEO, Class members at Folkston will get sick and die from this deadly pandemic \nillness. \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and \ncorrect. \nExecuted this 10th day of April, 2020, in Baxley, Georgia. \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-7   Filed 04/12/20   Page 1 of 12   Page ID\n #:5568\n \n \n \n \nEXHIBIT G \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-7   Filed 04/12/20   Page 2 of 12   Page ID\n #:5569\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA – EASTERN DIVISION  \nRAUL NOVOA, JAIME CAMPOS  Case No.: 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK \nFUENTES, ABDIAZIZ KARIM, and   \nRAMON MANCIA, individually and on  Assigned to Hon.

I serve as a Project Coordinator for the Southeast Immigrant Freedom Initiative of the \nSouthern Poverty Law Center (“SIFI”). SIFI represents people confined inside several immigrant \ndetention centers operated by GEO Group: the Folkston ICE Processing Center (“Folkston”) in \nFolkston, Georgia; the LaSalle Detention Center (“LaSalle”) in Jena, Louisiana; Pine Prairie ICE \nProcessing Center (“Pine Prairie”) in Pine Prairie, Louisiana, and, to a lesser extent, South \nLouisiana ICE Processing Center (“South Louisiana”) in Basile, Louisiana.   \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-7   Filed 04/12/20   Page 3 of 12   Page ID\n #:5570\n3.  Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, I have visited individuals in Pine Prairie and \nspoken by phone or video conference with individuals in South Louisiana and LaSalle. My \ncolleagues within SIFI have also spoken with individuals inside Pine Prairie and LaSalle. The \nparagraphs below reflect what my colleagues and I have personally witnessed and learned in recent \nweeks in conversation with people inside Pine Prairie, LaSalle, and South Louisiana. \n4.  GEO Group has prevented people inside these detention centers from practicing social \ndistancing—the  only  known  means  of  preventing  transmission—by  continuing  to  confine \nindividuals in groups of dozens or larger, with few opportunities for fresh air. In some instances, \nit has accepted transfer of individuals with COVID-19 into facilities it operates under contract with \nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  \n5.  GEO has failed to provide sufficient personal protective equipment and basic hygiene \nsupplies like soap to the people it is paid to care for. It has not given people inside these \ndetention centers adequate information about how to protect themselves from contracting \nCOVID-19. And in some cases, it has used force, in concert with ICE, to suppress the cries for \nhelp from detained people seeking facts and protection from contracting the virus. \nGrossly Deficient Group Setting Deprives Detained People of Social Distancing Measures \n6.  Individuals  in  GEO  Group  detention  centers  in  Louisiana  are  confined  in  crowded \ndormitories and are unable to practice the social distancing measures widely recommended by the \nCDC. Given the lack of a known cure for COVID-19, social distancing is considered the most \neffective  means  of  preventing  transmission.1  Individuals  in  Pine  Prairie  report  sleeping  in \ndormitories with 60 to 70 other individuals, in bunk beds spaced two to three feet apart. They share \nsinks, toilets, and showers, and eat together in crowded cafeterias. The sharing of bathrooms is \n \n1 Decl. of Homer Venters at 7, ECF No. 113-2, Fraihat v. ICE, Case 5:19-cv-01546 (C.D.

In LaSalle, a client reports \nas of April 6, 2020: “there are about eighty of us living in close quarters. We share three toilets, \nfour sinks, and six showers all in one open space. People are terrified in my dorm because some \npeople are sick with flu-like symptoms, including some officers. People are sneezing and coughing \nnear each other. The beds are spaced less than two feet apart. It is impossible to practice social \ndistancing.” Across GEO Group detention centers, detained individuals report that detention center \nstaff have made no efforts to space them out or implement other social distancing measures.  \n7.  In Pine Prairie, both Charlie-Alpha and Charlie-Charlie dorms have been placed under \nquarantines following suspected exposure to COVID-19. People in quarantined dorms report that \none or more individuals allegedly exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 were removed from the \ndorm, and the rest of the dorm was placed on a lock-down. While the isolation of potentially \nexposed individuals may have afforded some protection to the rest of the detention center, staff \nmade no effort to prevent individuals in the quarantined dorms from potentially infecting one \nanother. People under quarantine were not allowed to space themselves out, and were confined \ntogether in an enclosed space for almost 24 hours a day. During a visit to the facility on March 20, \n2020, I personally witnessed both quarantined and non-quarantined individuals held together in \nclose proximity while waiting to be brought into legal visits.  \nThe GEO Group Failed to Prevent Transfer of COVID-19 Infected Person into Facility \n8.  On April 3, ICE reported that an individual who had tested positive for COVID-19 was \ntransferred from the Oakdale Federal Correctional Institution into Pine Prairie. The Oakdale \nFederal Correctional Institution has been the site of a lethal and fast-moving outbreak of COVID-\n \n2 Id. at 3. \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-7   Filed 04/12/20   Page 5 of 12   Page ID\n #:5572\n19, with at least five confirmed deaths as of April 9, 2020.3 GEO Group’s willingness to accept a \nperson who was known to be infected with COVID-19 shows a stark disregard for the human lives \nin the corporation’s custody. This is especially striking in light of the heavy toll the virus has \nextracted over the Oakdale facility, where the threat that COVID-19 poses to individuals in \nincarcerated settings is clearly demonstrated. \n9.  In addition to the COVID-19 positive transfer, GEO Group has continued to allow the \ntransfer of large groups of individuals into the facility on an ongoing basis throughout the COVID-\n19 crisis. Detained people working in Pine Prairie’s intake have reported processing groups of \nnew arrivals ranging in size from 15 to over 70 individuals. Some of these new arrivals are believed \nto have been transferred from other detention centers around the state, and others are being moved \nfrom criminal custody.  People detained in Pine Prairie have expressed frustration and fear at the \ncontinued movement of new arrivals into the detention center, and at the fact that these new arrivals \nare housed alongside the general detained population. They are especially fearful of individuals \nwho were recently arrested off the street and brought into ICE custody, given the high rates of \nCOVID-19 infection in Louisiana and across the United States.  \n10. As of April 10, 2020, our client T.D. at LaSalle reports that yesterday individuals were \nbrought in from a county correctional facility who were visibly sick. The unabated flow of new \narrivals into GEO Group facilities places individuals already detained in the facilities at a markedly \nhigher risk of being exposed to infection. It also contradicts the CDC’s recommendation that \ntransfers of detained persons should be limited to “those that are absolutely necessary.”4 \n \n3 Caroline Habetz, “Fifth inmate at Oakdale federal prison dies from COVID-19,” KPLC (Apr. 3, \n2020), available at: https://www.kplctv.com/2020/04/03/fifth-inmate-oakdale-federal-prison-\ndies-covid-/. \n4 Decl. of Homer Venters at 7. \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-7   Filed 04/12/20   Page 6 of 12   Page ID\n #:5573\nThe GEO Group Provides Insufficient Personal Protective Equipment and Hygiene \nSupplies, Including Soap \n11. Detained individuals at Pine Prairie and LaSalle report a lack of appropriate Personal \nProtective Equipment (PPE). People detained in non-quarantined dorms are not provided any form \nof PPE. People held under quarantine are provided masks upon leaving their dorms, but are given \nno form of PPE while inside the dorm.  \n12. Detained people who work cleaning these dorms are also required by GEO Group to \ncontinue cleaning, without access to protective masks or gloves.  \n13. The lack of available PPE within quarantined dorms demonstrates GEO Group’s disregard \nfor the safety of those within these dorms, as staff make no effort to prevent the spread of COVID-\n19 among a group of individuals that are already at a heightened risk of exposure.  \n14. People detained in Pine Prairie have also reported that staff enter and leave the facility \nand the dorms, including the quarantined dorm, without wearing masks, gloves, or other forms of \nPPE. This is a cause of extreme concern among people in detention, as they understand that levels \nof COVID-19 infection are extremely high in Louisiana and that detention center staff are at a high \nrisk of carrying the virus.  \n15. One individual detained in the Charlie-Alpha dorm in Pine Prairie described a situation in \nwhich a guard was removed from the dorm halfway through her shift after exhibiting symptoms \nincluding sneezing and coughing. Despite the fact that she was both symptomatic of COVID-19, \nand was working in a dorm that had been quarantined for suspected COVID-19 exposure, she had \nbeen wearing neither a mask nor any other PPE.  \n16. As their concerns over being exposed to COVID-19 by GEO Group staff increased, \nindividuals in the Charlie-Alpha dorm made a written sign asking everyone who entered the dorm \nto wear a mask, and hung it on their door. The warden of the facility came to the dorm and removed \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-7   Filed 04/12/20   Page 7 of 12   Page ID\n #:5574\nthe sign. During a visit to the facility on March 20, 2020, I personally witnessed GEO Group staff \nwithout PPE in close proximity to both quarantined and non-quarantined individuals. \n17. At LaSalle, a client reported on April 6, 2020, “I have complained that the officers coming \nfrom the street to the facility are not wearing protective equipment and will sooner or later bring \nin the virus. The officers are not wearing masks because they said the facility does not allow that. \nThe only measure some have taken is to put on gloves to serve the food, and even then, not all of \nthem wear gloves.” This client further reported that as of April 10, 2020, an officer told her two \nLaSalle staff have tested positive and twelve have tested positive from the Alexandria Staging \nFacility.  \n18. Individuals  detained  in  other  centers,  including  South  Louisiana,  report  similar \ninconsistent use of PPE by GEO Group staff. GEO Group’s refusal to require its staff to wear PPE \nwhen  interacting  with  detained  individuals,  who  are  already  extraordinarily  vulnerable  to \ncontracting and spreading COVID-19, demonstrates a shocking lack of concern for the safety of \nindividuals ostensibly under its care. It also is a clear contradiction of CDC guidance, which now \nrecommends the use of protective masks for anyone within six feet distance of others.5 \n19. Individuals detained in Pine Prairie and South Louisiana additionally have reported a \nlack of access to even the most basic personal hygiene supplies, including soap, toilet paper, and \nsanitary napkins.  \n20. At both facilities, GEO Group did not provide detained people with soap and toilet paper \nfor days on end, with staff telling detained people that they had run out, or there wasn’t any left, \nwhen they inquired about additional supplies.  \n21. In South Louisiana, entire dorms of 50 to 60 women were expected to share three rolls of \ntoilet paper for up to a week.  \n \n5 Decl. of Homer Venters at 3-4. \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-7   Filed 04/12/20   Page 8 of 12   Page ID\n #:5575\n22. In LaSalle, common areas and the shared tablets are not disinfected, and dorms frequently \nrun out of hand soap and therefore do not have the ability to wash their hands.  \n23. As of April 9, 2020, individuals in the Charlie-Charlie dorm of Pine Prairie reported that \nthey were not being provided with soap, and that they were only able to access soap if they could \nafford to purchase it from the commissary. Individuals in the Charlie-Alpha dorm were told that \nthere were no more cleaning supplies when they asked for gloves and chemicals to sanitize their \ndorm. GEO Group’s inability to provide adequate personal hygiene supplies seriously hinders the \ncapacity of detained people to protect themselves from COVID-19. \nThe GEO Group’s Failure to Inform Detained People  \nAbout the Virus and Take Measures to Contain its Spread \n24. GEO Group staff have kept detained individuals in the dark for weeks about the spread of \nCOVID-19, the risks that people in detention face, and measures being taken to mitigate these \nrisks.  \n25. In Pine Prairie, the Charlie-Alpha dorm was held under quarantine for weeks without clear \nor consistent messaging from staff regarding why the dorm was quarantined or how long the \nquarantine might last.  The inhabitants of Charlie Alpha understood from staff that they were under \nquarantine for suspected COVID-19 exposure, but this was never communicated to them in an \nofficial way by the facility’s administrators or health staff. “We don’t know what they are doing,” \none detained individual in Charlie-Alpha told me over the phone during this time. “It feels like \nthey are playing games with us.”   \n26. Individuals in Pine Prairie and LaSalle have also consistently reported from the beginning \nof the pandemic that GEO Group has not provided them with any form of public health education \nabout the virus, its spread, or how to keep themselves safe.  \n27.  After GEO Group allowed the transfer of a COVID-19 positive individual into Pine \nPrairie, detained individuals already inside the center were not informed of this development. The \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-7   Filed 04/12/20   Page 9 of 12   Page ID\n #:5576\nday following the transfer, I spoke with individuals on the phone who told me that they could tell \n“something was going on” because the intake area was closed and they could see GEO Group \nguards wearing hazmat suits, but that they had not been given any information.  \n28.  Absent official guidance from GEO Group guards or administrators, detained \npeople  are forced  to piece  together an understanding of the virus’s spread through  rumor, \nobservation, guesswork, and piecemeal information filtered into the detention center from the \noutside world. This has contributed to widespread feelings of confusion, frustration, and mounting \npanic, as detained individuals suspect (in many cases rightfully) that GEO Group is withholding \ninformation crucial to their safety and survival.  \nThe GEO Group Uses Retributive Use of Force Against Detained People Seeking Safety \nfrom and Facts About Virus \n29.  Across GEO Group detention centers where SiFi works, growing fears about the \nspread of COVID-19, coupled with a lack of transparency from staff about the risks posed by the \nvirus, have contributed to an environment that is increasingly volatile and unsafe for detained \nindividuals.  \n30.  In Pine Prairie, on March 18, 2020, families and community advocates widely \nreported that a group of detained people were refusing to re-enter the detention center from the \nyard, because they believed that there were COVID-19 positive individuals inside the detention \ncenter. Although the incident did not turn violent, it was reported that GEO Group guards were \nstanding by with pepper spray and other weapons. On March 24, 2020, another protest broke out \nin the Echo block of dorms, with participants desperate to be freed from the detention center in the \nface of the mounting global pandemic. On this occasion, GEO Group guards responded violently, \nshooting at protestors with rubber bullets and pepper spray.  \n31.  One medically vulnerable client (“T.D.”) was raising concerns about COVID-19. \nIn response, on March 22, 2020, Captain Naggy at LaSalle told her that they were moving her into \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-7   Filed 04/12/20   Page 10 of 12   Page ID\n #:5577\na solitary cell. She asked Captain Naggy to talk to the mental health specialists at the facility \nbecause she mentally cannot survive in isolation and has panic attacks whenever she is left alone \nin a confined space, and has been seeing mental health staff about the condition every week. She \nthen heard Naggy tell two officers and a sergeant to “drag [her] boney skin ass to the cell.” He \nthen told other guards, “make sure you drag the bitch to the cell.” When the guards surrounded \nher, she told them that if they forced me into solitary, she would take her own life. After she \ndiscussed the situation with medical staff, Naggy told her that if she refused to go to solitary, she \nwould have to sign a statement saying that if she died from coronavirus, the facility would not be \nresponsible. Because she was surrounded by guards who she knew were instructed to drag her, she \nsigned. \n32.  She further reported, on April 6, 2020, that recently ICE provided coronavirus \ninformation to her dorm. When they presented to her, they were rude and aggressive. They would \nnot allow them to ask questions. When they asked about the insufficient amount of toilet paper and \nsoap, they grew angry and shouted at them. About two weeks ago, ICE officers went to Falcon \nCharlie to provide information about coronavirus. The women in that dorm were chanting for their \nrelease and saying they do not want to be left to die in this facility. That is when they pepper \nsprayed them. Because Falcon Charlie was next door to her, the pepper spray entered her dorm \nand she and others began coughing. A girl in her dorm fainted due to an uncontrollable asthma \nattack. She had an asthma attack. We banged on the door to get help to release her from the dorm \nto fresh air. Officers entered and immediately began coughing and had difficulty breathing. Shortly \nafter, she saw them taking some of the women from Falcon Charlie in shackles to solitary \nconfinement for chanting. \n33.  GEO Group staff at both LaSalle and Pine Prairie have responded to detained \nindividuals’ frustration and terror with disproportionately authoritarian and violent responses.  \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-7   Filed 04/12/20   Page 11 of 12   Page ID\n #:5578\nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct and that this \ndeclaration was executed on April 10, 2020 in New Orleans, Louisiana. \n \nKatrina L.

Overview of Background and Specializations.  \n1.  My name is Dr. Carlos Franco-Paredes and I am an Associate Professor of Medicine at the \nUniversity of Colorado in the Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases. I \ncompleted my internal medicine residency and infectious diseases fellowship at Emory \nUniversity School of Medicine.  I am also the Infectious Diseases Fellowship Program \nDirector and supervise the training of medical students, internal medicine residents, and \ninfectious diseases fellows at the University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Center. \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-8   Filed 04/12/20   Page 3 of 34   Page ID\n #:5582\n2.  In addition, I hold a public health degree in global health from the Rollins School of Public \nHealth at Emory University with a concentration on the dynamics of global infectious disease \nepidemics and pandemics. I also have twenty years of relevant clinical experience. From \n2006 to 2009, I participated in developing international guidelines for pandemic influenza \npreparedness and response as well as a global health action plan with the World Health \nOrganization.   \n3.  As an infectious diseases clinician, I have experience providing care to individuals in a civil \ndetention centers in the United States (US) and have performed medical second opinion \nevaluations for patients in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration \nand Customs Enforcement (ICE). I have also provided direct care for many patients in ICE \ncustody or incarcerated settings living with HIV-infection at my current academic institution.  \n4.  Over the last three weeks, I have witnessed firsthand the impact of COVID-19 at my \ninstitution providing direct care to 45 patients with this infection, with many requiring \nintensive care management and necessitating mechanical ventilator support.   \n5.  I present my Curriculum Vitae attached as Exhibit A. I have written and published \nextensively on the topics of infectious diseases pandemics and epidemics, particularly in \ninfluenza.  I have 198 scientific publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals.  I teach a \nclass at the school of medicine on caring for underserved populations including immigrants \nand incarcerated populations and in best practices in global health. \nII.

Formal Analysis. \nA. Global  and  US-Specific  Epidemiology  and  Impact  of  the  SARS-CoV-2 \n(COVID-19) Pandemic. \n7.  The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly emerging \nzoonotic agent initially identified in December 2019 that as of the date of this writing, has \nspread to 184 countries, causing 1,484,100 confirmed cases and 88,538 deaths. This viral \npathogen causes the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).  Infection with COVID-19 is \nassociated with significant morbidity and mortality, especially in patients above 55 years of \nage and those with chronic medical conditions.  \n8.  As of April 10, 2020, there have been 432,132 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 14,817 \nreported deaths in the U.S. There has been reports of confirmed cases in all US states and \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-8   Filed 04/12/20   Page 6 of 34   Page ID\n #:5585\nmost states have already reported deaths. The epicenters in the US territory began in the \nPacific Northwestern states and then to California and the Northeast, particularly New York \nCity and New Jersey.  Currently, the epidemic is rapidly spreading among US Southern \nStates including Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, and others. Many ICE detention centers are \nlocated in the U.S. South and the rapid spread of this viral infection among these states is a \nconcern that we need to monitor closely from an epidemiological perspective. \n9.  Recent reports by the CDC show that 31% of COVID-19 cases, 45% of hospitalizations, and \n80% of deaths occurred among adults over 65 years of age. Case-fatality in persons aged \nover 85 ranged from 10-27%, followed by 3-11% among persons aged 65 to 84, 1% among \npersons aged 55 to 64, and less than 1% among persons aged 20 to 54.  \nB.  Risk of Immigration Detention Centers Fueling the COVID-19 Pandemic. \n10. Immigration detention centers in the US are tinderboxes for the transmission of highly \ntransmissible infectious pathogens including the SARS-CoV-2, which causes the \nCoronavirus Disease (COVID-19). Given the large population density of immigration \ndetention centers, and the ease of transmission of this viral pathogen, the attack rate inside \nthese centers may reach exponential proportions consuming significant medical care and \nfinancial resources.   \n11. I reviewed COVID-19 guidance by ICE and CDC recommendations for carceral settings.  \nICE’s proposed plans and interventions to halt the spread of COVID-19 are well delineated \nand useful.  The CDC recommendations provide some guidance that is general and may take \ninto account the realities of some of these detention centers.  \n12. Both sets of guidance address social distancing in these centers, which appears to be difficult, \nif not impossible, in settings where many individuals are living in close quarters with a large \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-8   Filed 04/12/20   Page 7 of 34   Page ID\n #:5586\nnumber of beds per room or dorm. These recommendations and guidance are insufficient to \ncontain the spread of this infection behind walls of immigration detention centers. \nThroughout the history of humanity and outbreaks, pandemics and epidemics, population \ndensity in a closed space is the most import determinant of spread.  Immigration detention \ncenters are the antithesis of social distancing.  \n13. I have experience providing care to individuals in civil detention centers and I have \nperformed medical forensic examinations and medical second opinion evaluations for \npatients in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security. Based on my conversations \nwith patients, my own observations, and information that exists regarding the resources \navailable within immigration detention facilities as detailed by the ICE Health Services \nCorps, it is my professional opinion that the medical care available in immigration detention \ncenters cannot properly accommodate the needs of patients should there be an outbreak of \nCOVID-19 in these facilities. Immigration detention centers are often poorly equipped to \ndiagnose and manage infectious disease outbreaks.  \n14. In summary, I am concerned about the treatment of immigrants inside detention centers, \nwhich could make the current COVID-19 epidemic worse in the US. \nC. Potential Impact of the COVID-19 behind Walls of Immigration Detention \nCenters in the US. \n15. There is a growing number of confirmed cases in the US, increasing numbers of \nhospitalizations and admissions to intensive care units, and many deaths. In this wave of the \npandemic or in subsequent ones, it is likely the number of infected individuals will continue \nto augment. In the closed settings of immigration detention centers, where there is \novercrowding and confinement of a large number of persons, networks of transmission \nbecome highly conducive to spread rapidly.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-8   Filed 04/12/20   Page 8 of 34   Page ID\n #:5587\n16. There is evidence of substantial undocumented infection facilitating the rapid dissemination \nof novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 which is responsible for 79% of documented cases of \nCOVID-19 in China.  Once an individual is exposed to this virus from either a symptomatic \nindividual (21% of cases) or from asymptomatic individuals (79% of cases), the shortest \nincubation period is 3 days with a median incubation period of 5.1 (95% CI 4.5 to 5.8 days). \nOverall, 97.5% of persons who develop symptoms do so within 11.5 days of the initial \nexposure. Most persons with COVID-19 who develop severe disease do so immediately after \nadmission or within 3-5 days from their initial presentation and represent 53% of those \nrequiring intensive care unit admissions and advanced supportive care. At my current \ninstitution, the two confirmed deaths occurred within 48 hours of admission to the hospital.  \n17. Given the high population density of immigration detention centers, and the ease of \ntransmission of this viral pathogen, the infection rate will be exponential if even a single \nperson, with or without symptoms, that is shedding the virus enters a facility.  \nD. Potential Impact of a COVID-19 Outbreak in a Detention Center May be \nOverwhelming Local Healthcare Systems \n \n18. Detention of any kind requires large groups of people to be held together in a confined space \nand creates the worst type of setting for curbing the spread of a highly contagious infection \nsuch as COVID-19.  \n19. The number of private rooms in a typical detention facility is insufficient to comply with the \nrecommended airborne/droplet isolation guidelines.  Another important consideration that \ncomplicates disinfection and decontamination practices is the ability of this novel \ncoronavirus to survive for extended periods of time on materials that are highly prevalent in \nsecure settings, such as metals and other non-porous surfaces. Current outbreak protocols \nrequire frequent disinfection and decontamination of all surfaces of the facility, which is \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-8   Filed 04/12/20   Page 9 of 34   Page ID\n #:5588\nexceedingly difficult given the large number of incarcerated individuals, frequent interactions \nbetween incarcerated individuals and staff, and regularity with which staff move in and out \nof each facility. \n20. Responding to an outbreak requires significant improvements in staffing, upgrading medical \nequipment, substantial supplies including antibiotics, intravenous infusions, cardiac and \nrespiratory monitors, devices for oxygen supply, and personal protection supplies among \npersons at high risk of severe COVID-19 disease. Additionally, this outbreak calls for highly \ntrained staff to correctly institute, enforce isolation, quarantine procedures, and have training \non the appropriate utilization of personal protective equipment. It is essential that nursing and \nmedical staff be trained in infection control prevention practices, implementing triage \nprotocols, and the medical management of suspected, probable and confirmed cases of \ncoronavirus infection. \n21. These same personnel would have to initiate the management of those with severe disease. \nSince these are closed facilities, the number of exposed, infected, and ill individuals may \nrapidly overwhelm staff and resources. This is particularly important in rural and semirural \nsettings where many immigration detention centers are located, particularly in Southern \nStates and where they may have contact with a limited number of surrounding medical \ncenters.  As a result, many patients would need transfer to hospitals near these facilities, \nlikely overwhelming the surrounding healthcare systems, which are already functioning at \nfull capacity caring for the general non-incarcerated community.   \n22. A large outbreak of COVID-19 in an immigration detention facility would put a tremendous \nstrain on the medical system to the detriment of patients in the communities surrounding \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-8   Filed 04/12/20   Page 10 of 34   Page ID\n #:5589\nthese centers. It is reasonable to anticipate that there will be the loss of additional lives that \ncould have otherwise been saved. \nIV.  Expert Opinion. \n23. Immigration detention centers are tinderboxes of transmission of respiratory viruses \nincluding the SARS-CoV-2. Pandemics thrive in large crowds. Detention centers and \ncorrectional facilities are the anti-thesis of social distancing.      \n \n24. Current approaches to establish cohorts of exposed individuals at the Aurora Immigration \nProcessing Center are insufficient in reducing the transmission of COVID-19 transmission \ndynamics given the different degrees of exposure. Similar efforts have proven insufficient \nduring isolation and quarantine interventions conducted at the Princess Diamond Cruise \nexperience in Yokohama, Japan; and more recently in the Cook County Jail in the State of \nIllinois.  \n25. The newest report from the CDC demonstrates that one infected person transmits the \ninfection to more than FIVE other people – (Basic reproduction number R = 5.6). The basic \n0\nreproduction number (R ) consists of three factors: susceptibility of the population, \n0\ntransmissibility, and frequency of exposure.  The SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes \nCOVID-19, is a highly transmissible infectious pathogen since: a) there is no, or minimal \nunderlying population and individual immunity, b) it is highly transmissible (low infective \ndose), and the frequency of exposure (the more contacts/exposures, the higher the risk of \ncontagiousness).    \n26. Transmission of COVID-19 in a closed space favors its rapid spread if there is no complete \nsocial distancing to reduce the R to <1. This was exactly what happened during the Diamond \n0 \nPrincess Cruise experience in Japan where despite efforts to reduce transmission, among \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-8   Filed 04/12/20   Page 11 of 34   Page ID\n #:5590\nmore than 3000 passengers, more than 600 were COVID-19 positive, and 11 died. In Cook \nCounty Jail, there are more than 300 confirmed cases identified despite efforts to cohort \nexposed individuals and one reported death.  \n27. There is no mention of screening and testing practices of exposed individuals within the \nfacility to guide isolation and quarantine practices within the Aurora facility.  There is also \nno distinction between or an effort to distinguish isolation versus quarantine practices. \nScreening and testing those exposed is crucial to lessen transmission and to guide isolation \nand quarantine practices.  I suspect that based on current demands in the healthcare system, \nthat there is no resources or capacity in most States including the State of Colorado to use \ncurrent resources for screening purposes of detained immigrates who exposed to a COVID-\n19 case.  Without testing availability, most interventions behind immigration detention \ncenters are likely to fail to reduce the impact of a COVID-19 outbreak.   \n28. To contain the spread of the disease, infection prevention protocols must be meticulously \nfollowed including disinfection and decontamination practices. There is no mention in \nOfficer Ceja’s declaration of decontamination procedures only disinfection. \n29. Based Officer Ceja’s declaration, it is my opinion that GEO’s current protocols, even if \nfollowed to the letter, do not substantially reduce the risk of transmission and contraction of \nCOVID-19 to detained immigrants who are required to perform the compulsory cleaning and \nsanitation of commons areas such as showers, bathrooms, dayrooms, phone banks, and other \nareas in their dorm or pod.   \n30. It is my opinion that detained immigrants at the Aurora facility would be significantly less \nlikely to contract COVID-19 if they were not being forced to risk exposure by performing \nmandatory cleaning duties without access to PPE such as masks, gloves, and without reliable \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-8   Filed 04/12/20   Page 12 of 34   Page ID\n #:5591\ntesting inside the facility.  \n31. In conclusion, social distancing is a crucial public health intervention to ameliorate the \nimpact of a pandemic caused by a viral respiratory pathogen including influenza viruses and \nSARS-CoV-2. Incomplete adherence or partial implementation of social distancing is \ninsufficient to reduce transmission. Forcing some detained immigrants at Aurora to break \ntheir social distancing by cleaning their entire common areas amounts to a willful decision by \nOfficer Ceja and her employer to risk preventable exposure, infection, illness, and death of \ndetained immigrants to COVID-19.  In sum, the procedures Officer Ceja lays out fall \nwoefully short of a responsible, evidence-based public health approach to combatting the \nspread of this deadly pandemic.  \n \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true \nand correct. \n \nExecuted on this eleventh day of April 2020 at Aurora, Colorado, United States.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________________ \n  Carlos Franco Paredes, M.D., M.P.H. \nAssociate Professor of Medicine \nDivision of Infectious Diseases \nDepartment of Medicine \nDivision of infectious Diseases \nProgram Director Infectious Disease Fellowship  \nTraining Program, University of Colorado \n \n \n \nExhibit A.

I,   C-J-H-S,   make   this   declaration   based  o n   my   own  p ersonal   knowledge,   and   if   called   as   a  \nwitness,   I   could   and   would   testify  t o   the   facts   described   here.   \n \n2. I   am   currently   in   immigration   custody  a fter  b eing   arrested   by   ICE   agents   on   Tuesday  \nMarch   3,   2020,   in   the   middle   of   the  c oronavirus   pandemic.  I    am   seeking  i mmediate  \nrelease.   \n \n3. I   am   20   years   old   and   I   have   lived   in  S  outhern  C  alifornia   since  I    was   about   three  y ears  \nold.   My   parents   first   brought   me   to   the   U.S.   in   1999.    My  m  other   took   me   back   to   Mexico  \nin   2001   and   she   brought   me   back  a gain   in  2 003   when   I   was  a bout   three   years   old.    I   don’t  \nreally   remember   anything   about   living   in   Mexico  a nd   English   is   my   best  l anguage.   \n \n4. When   I   was   growing   up,   my   dad   was   very  a busive   to   me,  m  y   siblings,   and   my   mom.   I  \nlearned   from   my   mom   that   he   hit   her   while  s he  w  as   pregnant  w  ith  m  e,   so   really   my   dad  \nstarted   abusing   me   before   I   was   even   born.    I   can’t   even   remember   how   many   times   I  \nblacked   out   after   my   father   hit   me   in  t he   head   because   it   happened   so  m  uch.   Social  \nworkers   came   to   our   house   because   teachers   would   see   me   at   school  w  ith   bruises.  \nEventually,   my   dad   was   arrested   for  h itting   us  a nd  t hen  h e  w  as  d eported.   \n5. After   my   dad   was   deported,   mom   had   a  h ard   time  t aking   care   of  u s.    We   never   had   a  \nstable   place   to   live.    My   mom   eventually  l ost  c ustody   of  m  e  a nd  m  y  f our   other   siblings  \nbecause   the   Department   of   Child   and   Family   Services  s aid   that   she   was   not  t aking   care   of  \nus.    I   was   really   sad   to   be   separated   from  m  y   brother  a nd   sisters   and   ended  u p   homeless.   \n  \n6. I   had   some   trouble   after   I   became   homeless,  a nd  b y   the   time  I   w  as   12  I   w  as   in   the  c ustody  \nof   Orange   County   Juvenile   Probation.  O  range   County   Juvenile  P  robation   contacted   ICE  \nto   let   them   know   that   I   was   not   born   in   the   United   States,  a nd   I   was   placed   in   removal  \nproceedings   at   age   13.   In   2016,    I  w  as   supposed  t o   go   to   immigration   court  i n   Los  \nAngeles,   but   Orange   County   Juvenile   Probation   did   not   bring  m  e   for   my   court   hearing.  \nBecause   I   missed   the   court,   I   was  o rdered   removed    in   absentia  o  n   March   9,   2016.    I   was  \nsixteen   years   old   at   the   time.   \n \n7. My   immigration   attorney   filed   a   motion   to   reopen   my  p roceedings   and   the  I mmigration  \nJudge   granted   our   motion   on   March  3 ,  2 017.    I   only   missed  c ourt   in   2016   because   I   was  \nnot   allowed   to   leave   my   group   home   placement.   I   understand   that  I    have   to   go   to   all   of  \nmy   court   hearings,   and   I   make   sure   not   to  m  iss   any   court   dates.   \n \n8. I   have   been   diagnosed   with   lower  t han  a verage  c ognitive   functioning   and   sometimes   it  \ncan   be   confusing   for   me   to   understand  t hings  l ike   court  h earings.    I  h ave  a lways   had  \ntrouble   in   school,   and   it   is   hard   for   me   to   listen  t o   explanations   for   a   long   time.

After  \nspeaking   with   me,   the   Immigration   Judge   said   that   I   would   have   certain   safeguards  i n  \nplace   to   help   me   understand   what   was  h appening   in   court.   \n \n9. My   immigration   attorney   filed   an  a pplication   for   Special   Immigrant   Juvenile   Status  \n(“SIJS”)   for   me   on   June   8,   2017,   when   I   was   17   years  o ld.    Special  I mmigrant   Juvenile  \nStatus   is   a   designation   for   minors   who   have   been   abandoned,   abused,   or   neglected   by   one  \nor   both   of   their   parents.    A   state   court   judge   found  t hat   I   was   abandoned,   abused,  a nd  \nneglected   by   both   of   my   parents.    After  t he   state   court  m  akes   its   findings,   the  n ext  s tep   in  \nthe   SIJS   process   is   to   file   an   I-360  a pplication   with  U  nited  S  tates   Immigration   and  \nCustoms   Services   (USCIS).    My   application   for  S  IJS   was   approved   by   USCIS   on  \nOctober   3,   2018,   meaning   that   I   was   designated   a   Special  I mmigrant   Juvenile   and   given   a  \npath   to   permanent   residence.   My   attorney   filed   my   application   for   Adjustment   of   Status  \nwith   the   immigration   judge   on   March   2,   2020,  b ut  h e   hasn’t   made   a   decision   on  m  y  \napplication   yet.   \n \n10.On   my   18t h    birthday   in   June   of   2017,   I   was  r eleased  f rom  m  y   last   juvenile   placement   and  \nI   immediately   became   homeless  b ecause   I   had  n owhere  t o  g o   and   no   one   to   stay  w  ith.    I  \nstruggled   to   find   my   way   and   I   got  i nto  s ome   trouble   again.    I  s ustained  t wo   convictions  \nduring   this   period:   one   for   contributing   to   the  d elinquency   of  a    minor   (stemming   from   an  \narrest   in   July   2017),   and   another   for   joy   riding  ( stemming  f rom   an   arrest  i n   September  \n2017).   I   completed   my   sentence   in   October  o f   2017.  \n \n11. In   July   of   2019,   I   made   a   mistake  t hat   has   had   a  s ignificant  i mpact   on   my   life:  I   c arried   a  \nfirearm   and   an   ID   card   that   belonged   to  a    friend.   I  w  as   convicted   of   carrying   a  c oncealed  \nunregistered   firearm,   carrying   another  p erson’s   ID,  a nd  m  isrepresentation   to  a n  o fficer.  \nOn   October   7,   2019,   I   was   sentenced   to   364   days  i n   county   jail  a nd   5  y ears   probation,   but  \nI   only   served   about   80   days   in   jail.   I   have   learned   and   grown   from   my   mistake.  I   t ook   this  \nincident   as   a   very   serious   wake-up   call.    I   know   that   I   am  n ow  a n  a dult   and   I   have   to   be  \nresponsible   for   myself   and   the   direction   of   my  l ife.   While   I   was   serving   my   sentence   at  \nMen’s   Central   Jail,   I   signed   up   for  a    work   readiness   program   and   a   GED   program.    I  \ncompleted   the   work   readiness   program,   but   my   sentence   was  n ot  l ong   enough  t o  \ncomplete   the   GED   program.    Still,   the   GED  p rogram   motivated  m  e   to   go  b ack   to  s chool.   \n \n12.After   completing   my   sentence   on   January   16,   2020,  I   e nrolled  i n   a   high   school  \nequivalency   program   at   North   Orange   County  C  ommunity   College   in   Anaheim,   so  t hat   I  \ncould   work   on   my   high   school   diploma.   I   was  a    full-time  s tudent  a nd  I   a lso   made  s ure   to  \nattend   all   of   my   probation   appointments.   I   was   hoping  t o  g o   on   to   trade   school  a fter   I  \ngraduated.   I   am   interested   in   studying   culinary  a rts   to   work   as  a    chef.   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-9   Filed 04/12/20   Page 4 of 8   Page ID\n #:5617\n13.On   Monday,   March   2,   2020,   I   attended   my   immigration   court   hearing  a t  t he   Los   Angeles  \nImmigration   Court.   My   immigration  a ttorney  f iled  d ocuments   on   my   behalf   including   a  \nform   with   my   new   address   and   my   application   to  b ecome  a    permanent  r esident.   The  \njudge   received   the   documents   and   asked   us   to   return   to  c ourt   again   on   July  1 3,   2020.   \n \n14.On   the   night   of   Monday,   March   2,   2020,  m  y  p robation   officer   came   to  m  y   home   at  \naround   9:00   or   10:00   pm.   H  e   told  m  e   that   he   wanted   me  t o  r eport   to   his   office   the   next  \nday   at   9:30am   because   he   was   changing   the   time  o f   my   routine  v isit.    I   normally  r eported  \nat   2pm.    I   thought   it   was   strange  t hat   he   was  c oming  t o  m  y   home   late   at   night  t o  c hange  \nour   appointment   time   but   I   wanted   to   make   sure  I   f ollowed   all   of  t he   officer’s  d irections  \nso   I   told   him   that   I   would   be   there   in   the   morning.   \n \n15.On   Tuesday,   March   3,   2020,   I   went  t o   the   appointment   with  m  y  p robation   officer  a t  t he  \nAnaheim   Police   Station.    My   girlfriend  d rove   me   to  t he   appointment.    As  I   w  as   exiting  \nher   car   to   enter   the   office,   I   noticed   four  u nmarked  v ehicles   with   police   officers   inside  \nparked   nearby.   Once   I   saw   these   vehicles,   I   realized  t hat   they   looked   familiar;   I   had  \nnoticed   an   unmarked   vehicle   with  o ne  o r   two   people   in   it  w  aiting   outside  o f   my  \ngirlfriend’s   house   a   few   times   over   the   course   of   the   previous  f ew  d ays.    Then,   about  \nthree   officers   got   out   of   the   vehicle   and   approached  m  e.    The  o fficers   were   armed,   and  \nthey   had   on   bullet   proof   vests.   They   looked   like   police   officers  a nd   since  I   w  as   at   the  \npolice   station,   I   assumed   that   is   who   they   were.   \n \n16.One   of   the   officers   approached   me   and   took  o ut   handcuffs.   He   ordered   me  t o  p ut  m  y  \nhands   up   against   the   car   and   he   patted   me   down.   He   was   not   wearing   any   gloves,   and   he  \nstood   very   close   to   me   during   this   pat   down.   Then,   he   put   handcuffs  o n   me.    I   was   very  \nconfused   and   scared.   The   officer  n ever   asked   for  m  y   name  o r   told   me  w  hy   I   was  b eing  \narrested.    I   thought   maybe   he   was   mistaking   me  f or   someone   else,   so   I   told  h im  t hat   I   was  \njust   going   to   an   appointment   with   my   probation   officer.    But  h e  w  ould   not   listen   to  m  e.  \nHe   ordered   me   to   get   into   a   white   unmarked   vehicle   and   the  o ther   officers   returned  t o  \ntheir   vehicles.    We   drove   away   with   the   other   officers   following   behind   us  i n  t heir  \nvehicles.   The   officer   never   wore   a  m  ask   in   the  c ar   as  w  e  w  ere  d riving.    He   never  o ffered  \nme   a   mask   either.   \n \n17.I   heard   the   officer   talking   to   someone   on  t he   radio   about   picking   up   another  p erson   as   we  \ndrove   to   our   next   destination.    The   voice   on   the   radio   described  t he   clothes   the   person  \nwould   be   wearing   and   said   that   he   was   “five  m  inutes   out.”    When   we   arrived   at   our   next  \ndestination,   I   recognized   it   as   Orange  C  ounty   Juvenile   Hall  i n  O  range,   CA.    The  o fficer  \nexited   the   car   and   the   other   officers   exited  t heir  v ehicles  a s   well.    I   saw   them   arrest  a    guy  \nleaving   Orange   County   Juvenile   Hall.  N  one  o f   the  o fficers   used   protective   wear   of   any  \nkind   during   this   arrest   either.   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-9   Filed 04/12/20   Page 5 of 8   Page ID\n #:5618\n18.They   took   me   to   the   ICE   office   in  S  anta   Ana.    I   was   confused  a s   to   why  I    was   being  \ndetained   because   I   had   just   attended   my   immigration   court   hearing  t he   day   before   and   I  \nwas   scheduled   to   go   back   again   in   July.   ICE   did   not   say   anything  a bout   detaining   me  \nwhen   we   were   in   court   the   day   before.   Since  I   c ompleted   my   sentence   at   Santa  A  na  \nMen’s   Jail,   I   was   enrolled   in   school  a nd   attending   all  o f   my   probation  a ppointments.   I  \nwas   trying   my   best   to   turn   my   life   around.   I   also   did   not  u nderstand   why  I CE   went  t o  \nlook   for   me   instead   of   sending   a   notice   to   my   attorney   or   calling   her   to   ask   me   to  r eport  \nto   their   office.    They   also   could   have   sent  m  e   a  l etter   in   the   mail   because   they   had   my  \ncurrent   home   address.   \n \n19.In   the   Santa   Ana   ICE   office,   I   had   to  s it  i n  a    small   room   on   a   bench   with   other   people  \nwho   had   also   been   detained   by   ICE.    The   room   was   small,   so   it   was  n ot   possible   for   us   to  \nstay   6   feet   apart   from   one   another.   I   talked   to   the  g uy   who   had   been   arrested  o utside   of  \nJuvenile   Hall.   He   told   me   that   he   was   leaving   an   appointment   with   his   Juvenile  P  robation  \nOfficer   when   ICE   detained   him.   I   think   there   were  a bout   10   of   us   in   the   room.   The   ICE  \nofficers   came   in   and   out   of   the   room   as  w  ell,  s o   I   think   in   total  a bout   20   people   passed  \nthrough   the   room   throughout   the   day.  T  he  I CE  o fficers  d id   not  t ake  o ur  t emperatures   or  \nask   us   about   our   health.   No   one   offered  u s   hand   sanitizer   or   soap  t o   wash   our   hands.    The  \nonly   ICE   officers   who   wore   gloves  w  ere   the   ones   taking  f ingerprints   from  p eople  w  ho  \nhad   just   been   arrested.    None   of   the  I CE  o fficers  w  ore   masks.   \n \n20.When   it   was   already   dark   outside,   we  s tarted   driving  t o   Adelanto.    The   ICE   officers   put  \nme   in   a   van   with   about   six   other   detainees.   One   officer  t ouched   me  o n   the   hands,  t he  \nwrists,   ankles,   feet   and   waist   to   handcuff   me   and   put  t he   chains   around   my   ankles   again.  \nThe   officer   was   not   wearing   gloves   or   a   mask.   The   officer’s  b ody   was   very   close   to   mine,  \nand   at   some   points   we   were   face   to   face.    It   was   not   possible   to   maintain   six   feet  o f  \ndistance   in   the   van   because   the   space  w  as   too  s mall.    We   did  n ot   have   masks  e ither.    The  \ntraffic   was   really   bad   on   the   way  t o   Adelanto,   so   I   think  w  e   were   in   the   van  t ogether   for  \nover   three   hours   with   the   windows  c losed,   breathing   in  t he   same  a ir.   \n \n21.We   arrived   at   Adelanto   at   around   midnight  o n   March   4,   2020.    The   ICE   officers   brought  \nus   into   a   processing   room.    There  w  ere   already   people  i n   the   processing   room   when   we  \narrived,   and   another   van   came   at   around  t he   same  t ime.    I  t hink  t here   were   about   30  \npeople   in   the   room   waiting   to   be  p rocessed.    We  s at   on   benches  a t  a    distance   of   less   than  \nsix   feet   from   one   another.    We   were  n ot  g iven   hand   sanitizer,   masks,   or  g loves.    A  n urse  \ncame   to   evaluate   us   one   at   a   time.    She   had  a    mask   and  g loves.    She  w  as   the   only   person   I  \nsaw   that   used   a   mask   during   my   arrest   and  p rocessing.   She   took  o ur  t emperatures   and  \nasked   us   if   we   were   sick   or   not.   \n \n22.After   I   completed   processing,   I  w  as   assigned   to  t he   3C   dormitory   in   the   West  b uilding.   I  \nam   still   housed   in   this   dormitory.   I  t hink   there   are   about   fifty   people   in  m  y  d orm.    The  \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-9   Filed 04/12/20   Page 6 of 8   Page ID\n #:5619\ndormitory   has   a   day   room   and   shared   bathroom   area.   There  a re   several   cells   along   the  \nwall   that   have   rooms    with   either   four   or   eight   beds.    I   am   in   a   room  w  ith   four   beds.    The  \nbeds   are   bunk   beds   and   the   rooms   are   very   small.    It   is   impossible  f or  u s   to  s tay   six   feet  \napart   from   one   another   in   the   rooms.   \n \n23.We   have   to   walk   in   a   line   to   go   outside   or   go  e at   in  t he   cafeteria.  T  he   guards   would   make  \nus   walk   very   close   to   one   another   in   the   line.    We   had  t o  s tand   just   a  f ew  i nches  a part,   so  \nclose   that   you   can   feel   the   person   behind   you   breathing   on   you.    We   never   have   masks  \nwhen   we   stand   in   these   lines.   \n \n24.The   detainees   do   all   of   the   cleaning,   laundry,  a nd  k itchen   work  i n   the   facility.    I   am  \ncurrently   working   in   the   kitchen.    In  t he   kitchen,   we  p rep  a nd   serve   the  m  eals   for   all   the  \nother   detainees,   stock   food   in   the   freezer,   sweep  t he   floors,   and  m  op.    We   use   hair  n ets  \nand   gloves   but   no   masks.    I   have   not   worked  o n   the   cleaning   crew,   but  I   h ave  s een   other  \ndetainees   doing   this   work   in   the   detention  c enter.    When   they   clean,  t hey   wear   gloves   but  \nno   masks.    When   we   would   like  o ur  c lothes  t o   be   washed,  w  e   put   them   in   an   individual  \ndirty   clothes   sack.   The   sack   has   netting   and   the   detainees  w  ho  w  ork   in  t he   laundry  p ut   the  \nsacks   together   in   the   washing   machines   and   dryers   without  e ver  t aking   the   clothes   out.  \nSince   we   have   been   hearing   more   about  C  OVID-19,   I   have   been   trying   to  w  ash   my  \nclothes   myself   in   the   sink   using  a    hygiene   product  w  e   receive  t hat   is   similar  t o   shampoo,  \nbecause   I   don’t   think   my   clothes  c ould   be   washed  e nough   when   they   are  b unched   up  \ntogether   in   a   bag   and   never   taken   out.   I’m   also   concerned   about   other   detainees   touching  \nthe   clothing   bag   when   they   take   the   bag  a nd  b ring   it   back  t o   me.   \n \n25.Inside   our   dorm,   no   one   cleans   except   for  u s.    That   is   the   way   it   has   been   since  I   a rrived  \nhere   about   a   month   ago.    We   each   get   a   personal   hygiene   product   to   use   as  b oth   soap   and  \nshampoo.   Since   hearing   about   the   COVID-19   outbreak,   I   have   also  s tarted  u sing  t his  \npersonal   hygiene   product   to   clean   the  a reas   in  m  y   cell.    I   wish   we  h ad   cleaning   products  \nto   use   but   since   we   don’t,   the   best  I   c an   do   is   to   clean   with   my  s hower   soap/shampoo.   \n \n26.There   are   a   lot   of   areas   in   the   dormitory   that  w  e   all   have   to   share.   It   would   be   impossible  \nfor   us   to   wash   our   hands   every   time   we   have   to   touch   a   surface   that   others   touch  a s   well  \nbecause   this   happens   constantly   throughout   the   day.   For   example,   we   share  b athroom  \nfacilities   including   sinks,   toilets,   and   showers.    We   share  p hones   and   a   tablet   to   make  \nphone   calls.    We   also   have   a   water   cooler   with  a    water  j ug   that  w  e  a ll   share.  W  e   all  h ave  \nto   touch   these   surfaces   throughout   the   day,   and   we   use   them   immediately   after   each   other.  \nWe   do   not   have   hand   sanitizer   in   our   dormitory,   and   we   do  n ot  h ave   access  t o   any  \ncleaning   products   that   are   meant   to   be   used  o n   surfaces.   \n \n27.On   Friday   March   27,   2020   at   around   3:00pm,  a nother  d etainee  i n  m  y  d orm   became   very  \nill.    He   collapsed   in   the   shower   and   needed  m  edical   attention.    I   did   not   see   him   myself  \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-9   Filed 04/12/20   Page 7 of 8   Page ID\n #:5620\nbut   others   who   saw   him   said   that   he   looked   like   he   turned   black.    None   of  t he   GEO  \nguards   noticed   that   he   was   sick,   but  o nce   he   collapsed   several  d etainees   went   to  g et   the  \nGEO   guards   in   our   dormitory   area  t o  a sk  f or   help.    The   man  w  as   taken  o ut  o f   our  \ndormitory   and   he   has   never   returned.    Shortly  a fter   he   was   taken   out,  G  EO  g uards   told   us  \nthat   our   dormitory,   West   3C,   was   being  q uarantined.    They  d id   not   give   us   any   other  \ninformation   or   screen   us   for   any  p ossible   illnesses.   \n \n28.A   few   hours   later,   another   detainee   became  v ery  i ll.  I t   happened   around   the   time   we   were  \ngoing   to   eat   dinner   in   our   dayroom.    The  m  an  s aid   he  w  as   having   trouble   breathing.    He  \ntried   to   walk   across   the   day   room   to   ask   a  G  EO   guard   for   help,  b ut   he   could   not   make   it  \nacross   the   room.   I   saw   when   he   fell  t o   the   floor   and   he   looked   very   sick.    It   looked   like   he  \ncouldn’t   catch   his   breath.    Another  d etainee  g ot   the   GEO  g uard   in   the   dormitory  q uickly.  \nThe   guard   called   the   nurse,   but  s he  d id   not   come   for   probably   about   ten   minutes.    When  \nthe   nurse   arrived,   she   was   wearing  a    mask   and  g loves.   The  n urse   helped   the   sick   detainee  \ninto   a   wheelchair   and   took   him   out   of  t he   room.    He   never   came   back,   and   we   never  \nheard   anything   about   how   he   is   doing.   \n \n29.It  m  ade   me   feel   upset   and   scared   that   no  o ne  t alked   about   the   two   men   who   got  s ick   and  \nwere   taken   away.    The   GEO   guards  w  anted   us   to   just   go  a bout   our   day   like   nothing  h ad  \nhappened.    GEO   guards   came   to   take   their   belongings  o ut  o f   the  d ormitory,  b ut  t hey  \nnever   sanitized   their   cells   or   the  c ommon   areas   in   our   dormitory.   \n \n30.Once   the   quarantine   started,   the   guards   began   wearing   masks   when   they   came   into   our  \ndormitory.    However,   once   the   quarantine   was   over   about   a   week  l ater   the   guards   stopped  \nwearing   masks   again.   \n \n31.There   are   other   people   in   my   dormitory  w  ho   are  s ick  n ow.   I   hear   them   coughing.    If   we  \nwant   to   see   the   nurse,   it   usually   takes  a bout   three   days.    We   have   to   put   in   a   “kite”,  w  hich  \nis   a   letter   to   ICE.    Then   we   have   to   wait   for   an   answer   to   our   kite.    I   don’t   think   this   is   a  \ngood   system   because   if   someone   feels  s ick,   they  h ave  t o  w  ait   for   days  t o   see   a   nurse.  \nDuring   that   time,   they   can   make  t he   rest   of  u s   sick   too.   \n \n32.We   still   have   never   received   any  i nformation   about   why   we   were  i n   quarantine.    We   have  \nTV’s   in   our   dormitory,   and   we   watch   the   news  t o  l earn  a bout   what   is   happening  i n   the  \nworld.    From   watching   the   news,   we   have   learned   about   the   COVID-19   pandemic.    The  \nnews   keeps   saying   every   day   that  p eople   are   dying  b ut   there  a re   almost   no   changes   inside  \nour   dormitory.    The   guards   sometimes   spray   the   dorm   handles  b ut  o ther   than   that   we   do  \nnot   have   any   extra   cleaning   procedures   in   place.    The  G  EO  g uards   and   ICE  o fficers  h ave  \nnever   provided   us   with   any   information   about  C  OVID-19   or  a bout   how   to   stay   safe.  \nEarly   this   week,   I   heard   on   the   news   that  s everal  I CE  o fficers   have  b een  d iagnosed   with  \nCOVID-19.

I was detained in Pod C-3. While the numbers of detainees in the pod fluctuates, \n2  in the last two weeks, I shared a pod with 27 detainees. Our beds were about a foot apart. The \n3  Ni!PC staff did not move our be�s further foI Io  wing the local outbreak of CO VID-19. Our beds \ni\n4  wele never six feet apart. I knew  at I was high-risk so I went to the ICE doctor and asked for a \n5  letter from her saying that I could move to a bed upstairs where I could maintain further distance \n6  frof the other detainees. I could not have received this accommodation by asking the officer; it \n7  to come from the medical sta f. \n8  4.  The way that the facility is set up, it is impossible to keep a distance of six feet \n9  een people. When you go to the medical clinic, for example, you're sitting there on the \n10  be1lch with several other people.  he same is true when I get medicine. The guards call everyone \n11  frof the pod who takes medicine to come line up, say 10-15 people standing in line. The officers \n12  stand around with us while we're in the pill line, like 10 of them. They treat it like it's the water \n13  coo er, standing around chatting. They didn't ask us to keep six feet between us in line after the \n14  virus broke out. The officers weren't doing that either. \n15  5.  The same problem  with maintaining distance are elsewhere too. When we eat \n16  meals, we line up and one officer  akes your ID card, one detainee gives you a tray, and another \n17  detainee gives you condiments and utensils. We sit at the same table to eat. You 're interacting \n18  witlji a lot of people at close distance. We are not six feet apart. At recreation time, they didn't \n19  tell  s to maintain six feet between us and the officers did not practice that either. \n20  6.  We did not really gbt much information from GEO or ICE about what precautions \nJ\n21  we should be taking. The warden  ame to our pod one time and spoke to us. It was on March \n22  13t�, a Friday. He said that if an officer is sick they would be sent home. He didn't talk to us \n23  about social distancing. When I w  ke up the following Sunday, I heard an officer coughing \nDAWSON DECL.

I saw her at Sam and hr shift was ending at 7am, meaning she had been there all shift \n2  with that cough. When I got my insulin that morning, I told them about her cough and asked \n3  them to tell someone that she shouldn't be there. \n4  7.  They did not put aJy marks on the ground so we could tell how far six feet apart \n5  is. We never received any education about social distancing. Everything I learned about \n6  maintaining six feet distance was from watching the news on TV.  Some officers told us we \n7  should stop watching the news because it was just going to stress us out. \nl \n8  8.  We all use the samI water fountain, including the officers, and I've never seen it \n9  cleaned. All detainees use the san e toilets, the same showers.

The trays are not \n11  always well cleaned, something I fad complained about even before the virus broke out. We also \nI \n12  share a sink and microwaves with  he officers as well. \n13  9.  To use the sink by  he bathroom, you have to press the button on the faucet to \n14  make the water come out. It always stops running too fast and you have to press it several times. \n15  It does not stay on for a full 20 se onds. The sink and all of its parts are made of metal. Paper \n16  towf ls often run out so we have to use toilet paper to dry our hands. There is another sink by the \n17  microwave, which we and the officers use to wash dishes and wash our hands. That sink is also \n18  metal and it has a lever to turn it on. \n19  10.  The detainees are the ones required to do the cleaning in the facility. The \n20  detainees are the ones asked to wipe down surfaces. We have to ask an officer to open the locked \n21  janitor's closet where the cleaning solution is kept. You can only get it to wipe the table, before \n22  and after dinner. The people who were assigned to cleaning duty could request to use the \n23 \nDAWSON DECL. IN SUPP. OF PET'R'S.-PLS.'

This is how it \n2  was after the local outbreak of COVID-19 too. \n3  11.  The officers were not wearing masks for the most part. The officers I saw wearing \n4  masks were the ones who went to guard these small cohorts with about two detainees. I heard \n5  that the cohorted detainees were sick. Even the officers who work in the quarantined cells do not \n6  wear masks. I saw other officers vyith masks clipped to their belts but they were not wearing \n7  them. Masks were not provided to detainees. As for gloves, officers did not regularly wear them. \n8  They wore them during bunk searches but beyond that, never. The detainees wear gloves if \n9  needed for their job duties. \n10  12.  Recently, on one occasion, I saw an officer become angry because the medical \nI \n11  clinic would not provide him with a mask. This officer had a cold and said he was taking \n12  Dayquil, but that it was not helpint I observed this because I was in the pill line and was within \n13  in six feet of the officer requestin  the mask. The medical clinic refused to give him a mask. \n14  13.  The guards do not provide us with information about any testing for the virus, but \nI \n15  I have only heard of 2 people bein  tested, one guard and one detained person. \n16  14.  There are more officers out than usual. They are short staffed. It's very noticeable. \n17  The officers talk about it. They are working double shifts. I think it is very careless. \n18  15.  When detainees need to be hospitalized they are generally brought to St. Joseph's \n19  Hospital in Tacoma. Even before thI e virus broke out, it has always been a problem for detainees \n20  to go to the hospital if they are sick. When I first arrived I was in a lot of pain. I kept telling the \n21  medical staff that I was in so muc  pain, something wasn't right. After a long time of being in so \n22  much pain, I finally was able to ge  someone to take me seriously. Then I had to spend four days \n23  in the hospital because my symptoms were so bad. And I have it better than a lot of people in \nDAWSON DECL. IN SUPP. OF PET'R'S.-PLS.'

I was previously detained at the Northwest ICE Processing Center (NWIPC) in \n21 \n22 \nTacoma, Washington, from November 2019 until March 25, 2020. \n22 \n23 \n23 \nESPINOZA ESPARZA DECL.

I was detained in Pod A-3. While the numbers of detainees in the pod changes, in \n2  the last two weeks, I shared a pod with around 80 detainees. From my bed, there was another \n3  person’s bed right next to mine. There was a metal wall between the beds, but it did not run the \n4  whole length of the beds, so we were only inches apart. Then the next set of beds were maybe \n5  three or four feet away. The NWIPC staff did not move our beds further apart after the news \n6  started to report about the virus. It is not possible that the beds were six feet apart.  \n7  4.  The way that the facility is set up, it is impossible to keep a distance of six feet \n8  between people. When you go to medical, for sick call, for example, they make a line of people \n9  and then the guards told you to sit, right next to the others. Then, once they determine which \n10  doctor you are seeing, they take you to a holding room that is quite small, maybe ten feet by four \n11  feet, with 10-15 people in that room. You are very close to everyone in that small space. At pill \n12  line, they call everyone who takes medicine to come line up, say around 30 people standing in \n13  line. When I had to go to pill line, the guards lined up us maybe a foot from each other.  \n14  5.  When we eat, we are close to other people because there are only eight tables and \n15  they are all full of people, so you have to sit next to other people. When we eat meals, we line up \n16  and one officer takes your ID card. In the line, we are all right next to each other, one behind the \n17  other. We are not six feet apart. At recreation time, they didn’t tell us to maintain six feet \n18  between us.  \n19  6.  The guards did not give us hand sanitizer, but gave us a spray that we used for \n20  cleaning the phones and tablets, and they told us to use on our hands as well. In the bathrooms, \n21  there were only three sinks for the 80 of us, so you could not wash your hands for 20 seconds, \n22  because there was a long line of people behind you, telling you to hurry up. And, in that line, we \n23 \nESPINOZA ESPARZA DECL.  NORTHWEST IMMIGRANT RIGHTS PROJECT  \nCase No. 2:20-cv-409  615 Second Avenue, Suite 400 \nSeattle, WA 98104  \nTel.

Nothing of this changed in March, even though on the news they were \n2  talking about the virus.  \n3  7.  In February, I don’t remember the exact day, the water from the sinks, the toilets, \n4  the showers and the water fountain had come out black and it smelled bad. We asked for \n5  drinking water, but the guards told us there was none and we just had to wait. Finally, at about \n6  9pm that night, the water finally started to go clear again.  \n7  8.  I did not see the guards in A-3 pod wearing masks. Only one guard in A-3 would \n8  wear gloves if he was passing out things, but the others would never wear gloves. No one gave \n9  us masks or gloves.  \n10  9.  Early in March—I think on the first Wednesday, March 4—I recall the director of \n11  the facility told us he would not put new people into the pod because of the virus and that they \n12  would quarantine new people. But, then later that same week, 11 new people arrested in the \n13  Kent, Tukwila, maybe Seattle area that same day were brought into our pod, A-3. One or two of \n14  these people seemed sick. These 11 people is what brought the pod up to 80 people.  \n15  10.  In fact, two of these new people were taken out of the A-3 pod after March 4 and \n16  before the following Wednesday because they were sick. Both said they thought they had \n17  coronavirus, but no one ever told us what they had. Both had a fever and a dry cough. I don’t \n18  know what happened to them.  \n19  11.  It was then the following Wednesday, I think March 11, when several of us who’d \n20  been in the pod longer joined together and spoke with Portillo, a head officer. We asked him why \n21  did you bring more people? He said I can’t control ICE that ICE told him what to do. He said he \n22  had orders from ICE that all the new people had to be put in pods.  \n23 \nESPINOZA ESPARZA DECL.

There was also another man, a Mexican, and another from El Salvador and \n2  another from Honduras who felt bad during March, with fever and cough and went to the doctor. \n3  But the doctor just gave them Tylenol and ibuprofen and sent them back to the pod that day. \n4  13.  The detainees are the ones required to do the cleaning in the facility. The \n5  detainees are the ones asked to wipe down surfaces in the pod. When I worked as a cleaner in the \n6  pod, I worked starting at 11:30 at night, I cleaned the tables, the tablets. There is another cleaner \n7  in the morning who does the same. But, sometimes, during the day, the tables would stay dirty \n8  until the evening when someone would clean them. This did not change in March.  \n9  14.  In March, I noticed a change and it seemed to me that the officials were working \n10  more double shifts because they didn’t have a lot of officials.   \n11   \n12   \n13     \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \nESPINOZA ESPARZA DECL.

My name is Flavio Lopez Gonzalez and I am 26 years old. I am currently detained at the \n4  Northwest Detention Center. \n2.  I am currently involved in a hunger strike at the Northwest Detention Center to protest \n5 \nthe handling of the COVID-19 crisis.  \n6 \n3.  I have had asthma for much of my life, and I currently have bronchitis. To deal with the \nbronchitis, I am currently taking Tylenol, a mucus decongestant, and I also use an inhaler. \n7 \n4.  The situation at the detention center is not safe for people like me who are at serious risk \n8 \nif COVID-19 outbreaks at the detention center. We are not able to engage in social \ndistancing in all kinds of activities. This includes lining up for food, or when we have to \n9 \ndo “count,” when they make all of us wait in our bunks while we are counted. \n10 \n5.  The same problems with bunching people occur when we go to court. The guards place at \nleast 20 of us together in a holding room. Then they bring us out to court, where they \n11 \nonly let 5 detainees in at a time. The guards tell the judge, who appears telephonically, \nthat there are only five people in the room, but out in the hall, we are bunched together \n12 \nsitting next to one another. We also mix with people from other pods when we are taken \nto immigration court. \n13 \n6.  During meals, we are also close to one another; it is not possible to sit 6 feet away from \n14  the other detainees; in fact, we sit right next to one another with our trays touching so that \nwe can fit and eat. People, including the guards, also often bunch together around the sink \n15  and microwave in groups of 6-8 people. The tables are cleaned by the detainees after each \nmeal.  \n16 \n7.  Our bunks in the detention center are very close to one another. I would estimate that \n17  they are spaced about 5 feet apart from one another, and that with the bunk beds, the bed \non top is around 3-4 feet above the lower bed. \n18 \n8.  The beds in my pod in the detention are grouped into sections of 8-12 people. People in \n19  these sections cannot distance from one another because of how close the beds are to one \nanother. \n20 \n9.  There are around 70 people in my pod in the detention center. We all live in the same \n21  space together like a dorm. I would estimate that 90% of the bunks in my pod are \noccupied. \n22 \n10. There is soap in the detention center to wash the dishes and by the sink to wash our \nhands. We have to buy soap for showers. The soap for dishwashing often leaves grease \n23 \non the dishes and trays and is not very effective. To run the sink for handwashing, you \nhave to push a button. The water runs for about 5-10 seconds when you push it. \n \nLOPEZ GONZALEZ DECL.  NORTHWEST IMMIGRANT RIGHTS PROJECT  \n  615 Second Avenue, Suite 400 \nSeattle, WA 98104  \nTel.

To dry our hands, we often have to use toilet paper rolls. Up until two days ago, everyone \njust used and touched the same rolls. Two days ago, they installed a roller that we can \n2  grab to pull off the toilet paper to dry our hands. When the paper runs out, we have to go \nask the guard for more to dry our hands. \n3 \n12. The phones that we use are cleaned every few days by other detainees. The frequency of \n4  this cleaning has not changed since the pandemic began. The exercise equipment in our \npod is also cleaned 1-2 times a week, and this also has not changed since the pandemic \n5  began. There also have not been changes in our recreation time. People still have physical \ncontact playing basketball and soccer, and people are also close to one another when they \n6  play card games at the tables in the pod. \n13. I have not seen the guards wearing masks, except that I once saw once guard wearing a \n7 \nmask when that guard was working with a quarantined cohort. \n8 \n14. Not long after my arrival at the detention center, my pod was placed into quarantine. \nPrior to our quarantine, the guards first transferred back into our pod other people that \n9 \nhad recently transferred to other pods. None of us, including the guards, wore a mask \nwhile we were in quarantine. \n10 \n15. While in quarantine, I was unable to receive medical attention. I was feeling sick, \n11 \nfeverish, fatigued and had congestion in my chest and diarrhea. I complained and \nrequested medical attention because of the issues that I was experiencing, but I was not \n12 \ntaken to see a doctor. \n13 \n16. Our quarantine was lifted around 7-10 days ago. After that, I was able to visit the medical \nclinic, where I was told that I have bronchitis. My visit to the medical center is when I \n14 \nwas prescribed the Tylenol, the inhaler, and mucus decongestant. I was given a test for \ninfluenza, but that came back negative. \n15 \n17. Because of the chest issues that I was experiencing, I requested a test for COVID-19. The \n16  doctor I first talked to said I could receive a test. But then that doctor’s supervisor \noverruled the doctor and said that I did not meet the qualifications for a test. I do not \n17  know what qualifications the doctor was referring to. \n18  18. I have observed some detained that have COVID-19-like symptoms, like lots of \ncoughing. For example, there is one who clearly sleeps near me who coughs a lot.  \n19 \n19. I have not heard of anyone receiving a COVID-19 test during my time here. I do know \n20  that they have placed some pods under quarantine, like they did with my pod for a time. \n21  20. I am very concerned for my health here. I know I am at high risk because of my asthma \nand current bronchitis situation. That is why I am involved in a hunger strike, in order to \n22  protest our treatment so that the detention center releases us and we can go be with our \nfamilies to support them during this difficult time.  \n23 \n21. I have been threatened with segregation and an increase in security level if I continue the \nhunger strike.  \n \nLOPEZ GONZALEZ DECL.

My name is Norma Lopez Nuñez. In the past, I have also gone by my married name, \nNorma Cecilia Zanabria. I was born in Mexico, and am 65 years old. \n4 \n2.  I submit this declaration in support of the multi-person petition for a writ of habeas \ncorpus in federal court and complaint for injunctive relief based on the risks that I face \n5 \nbecause of COVID-19. \n6 \n3.  I have been detained in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security since 2015. \nI have been at the Northwest Detention Center (also called the Northwest ICE Processing \n7 \nCenter) for about three years. \n8 \n4.  I was assigned to pod D1 at the detention center. Recently, the officials moved everyone \nin our pod to a unit occupied by individuals in pod B1, combining our numbers to make a \n9 \npod of about 67 detainees total, with the addition of at least one officer who is always \npresent in the unit.  \n10 \n5.  There are two levels in the unit where our pods spend most of our time. By my estimate, \n11 \nthe lower level of the unit is about 45 by 30 or 38 feet, and 45 people are housed down \nthere. The upper level is about 30 by 15 feet, and I think about 22 people are housed up \n12 \nthere. There are three bathrooms on the lower level and three bathrooms on the upper \nlevel – six toilets total, for 67 people to share. The rooms in the unit are not well-\n13 \nventilated. \n14  6.  The beds downstairs are out in open air; individuals do not have their own rooms. \nUpstairs I think there are about 30 beds, and 22 of those are occupied. In the small room \n15  where I stay, 6 other individuals sleep there as well. The beds are close together, and we \nbasically sleep head-to-head. I believe some rooms have up to 12 people in them.  \n16 \n7.  On the lower level of the unit, there are only 13 tables where all 67 detainees must eat \n17  together, and the seats are close together. I do not know if the tables are properly \nsanitized after we use them, and I worry with so many people touching those surfaces that \n18  the tables may be very dirty. The area with the microwaves is constantly crowded, \nsometimes with 20 people waiting in line in a small area to microwave their food.  \n19 \n8.  We are most crowded when we wait in line for the bathrooms. The officers make us line \n20  up for the bathrooms, and we must stand close together to fit in the space when there are \nmany people in line, as there frequently are. One of the sinks upstairs is currently out of \n21  soap. \n22  9.  Though there are three showers on my floor, we all line up for the handicap-\naccommodating shower, because it is the only one with consistent hot water. We buy \n23  soap for the shower at the commissary, but some people do not have commissary funds to \nbuy soap. \n \nDECL.

There are a few tablets in our unit, and there are always people in line to use the tablets. I \nworry that the tablets are not sufficiently sanitized between uses and that they are dirty as \n2  well. \n3  11. In the open space where I am right now as I dictate this declaration, there are eight people \nbehind me in very close proximity, waiting for the phone I am currently using because \n4  the other phone is not working. There are three tables full of other individuals in this \nroom, as well.  \n5 \n12. There is only one area where we may go outside, and this area also gets very crowded.  \n6 \n13. The officers in my unit are in their 60s. None of them wear masks or gloves. Today for \nthe first time I saw an officer in the detention center wearing a mask, when I went to visit \n7 \nthe doctor in the clinic. Other than this, I have not seen officers wearing masks here. \n8 \n14. The officers have not given us any specific instructions regarding handwashing or \nmaintaining six feet of distance between ourselves. Even if they did, it would be \n9 \nimpossible to maintain six feet of distance, because we are constantly in line for \nbathrooms, phones, and tablets, and there are many of us in a confined space. The \n10 \nofficers just tell us to stay in line. \n11 \n15. I have had respiratory and throat issues in the past, and I have also had issues with my \nheart. My head frequently hurts here, and I feel pressure behind my eyes. I’ve had a \n12 \ndiminished appetite lately, and I’ve had suicidal ideations in the past. I don’t want to \nreceive medical treatment for any of these issues, however, because they will put me in \n13 \nmedical isolation, and then I won’t be able to talk to anyone. I am afraid medical isolation \nwould exacerbate my mental health issues.  \n14 \n \n15     \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n \nDECL.

My name is Leónides Plutin Hernandez. I am from Cuba and am 59 years old. \n4 \n2.  I submit this declaration in support of a multi-plaintiff petition for a writ of habeas corpus \nin federal court based on the risks that I and others face because of COVID-19. I was a \n5 \nplaintiff in this lawsuit, but I was released on March 25, 2020. \n6 \n3.  I was detained at the Northwest Detention Center for about one month after spending \nseveral other months in other detention centers. \n7 \n4.  During my time at the Northwest Detention Center, I was housed in an open area for \n8 \nabout two weeks and in a room with a cellmate for around two weeks. I would estimate \nthat around 50 people were housed in the open area, and 50 people in the 2-person rooms. \n9 \nThe 2-person rooms were located around the perimeter of the open area, so in total, I \nestimate about 100 people were housed in the same space. \n10 \n5.  I was in the open area for the first two weeks. I estimate that the beds in the open area are \n11 \nlocated about one meter apart from another. During the last two weeks, I was in a room \nthat I shared with another individual. In that room, there were bunk beds. The beds in the \n12 \nbunk bed were around a meter or less from one another, which I know because I \nsometimes hit my head on the bed above me. \n13 \n6.  It was not possible to maintain a distance of two meters from other people during my \n14  time in the detention center. We slept near one another and there were lots of people in an \nindoor space. In addition, when we had meals, there was not space to maintain that \n15  distance from other people. The tables are spaced in a way that does not permit you to sit \ntwo meters apart from other people. \n16 \n7.  I did not see anyone clean the tables in the eating area between uses by individual people. \n17  Instead, the tables were only cleaned after everyone had their meal. There were \nmicrowaves too, but they were not cleaned between each use.  \n18 \n8.  Cleanliness in the detention center depended upon individual detainees. It was a \n19  collective space, and many people do not clean up after themselves.  \n20  9.  It was not always easy to get soap to bath myself during the month that I was detained at \nthe Northwest Detention Center. On one occasion during March, I went three days \n21  without soap because the only way to get soap to bath myself and wash my hands was to \nbuy the soap at the detention center store.  \n22 \n10. As far as I can recall, the availability of soap did not change during my time in detention \nin the Northwest Detention Center, except that on my last day at the detention center I \n23 \nrecall that someone placed a soap dispenser by the side of the microwave for \n \nSECOND PLUTIN HERNANDEZ DECL.

There was also some soap in the bathroom that was to be used for washing \none’s underwear. \n2 \n11. When I went to the bathroom, I had to ask for paper towels to use in the bathroom. They \n3  were not available without asking for them from the guard.  \n12. I also do not remember receiving instructions from the guards or the detention center \n4 \nwarden about how to protect against the coronavirus. Instead, I learned about the virus \nand what to do to protect against it through the TV in the detention center. \n5 \n13. I did not observe changes at the detention center during the month that I was detained \n6 \nthere to deal with the health concerns of COVID-19. For example, I don’t remember \nseeing the guards wearing masks or gloves.  \n7 \n14. The detention center washed our towels and clothes once a week. This schedule did not \n8 \nchange because of the COVID-19 outbreak. \n9 \n15. There are 7 public telephones that the estimated 100 people in the area I was detained had \nto use. This was a tremendous risk to my health, because the phones are not cleaned in \n10 \nbetween each use.  \n11  16. There was also only one piece of exercise equipment in our area, and it also was not \ncleaned between uses by different people. \n12 \n17.

I am currently employed as a associate attorney by the firm Immigrant\nAdvocacy and Litigation Center, PLLC in Kent, Washington where I practice exclusively in\nimmigration law.\n2. On Tuesday March 31st, 2020, I was scheduled to appear for a court hearing at the Northwest\nICE Processing Center (“NWIPC,” for formally known as the Northwest Detention Center) in\nTacoma, Washington.\n3. When I entered the facility, I noticed four officers sitting in and around the front desk. Of the\nfour officers, only one officer was wearing gloves and a mask. The other three officers were\nnot wearing any personal protective equipment (PPE). The officer wearing the PPE took down\nmy credentials and gave me a questionnaire to fill out. Another officer approached me and\ntook my temperature with a laser temperature collection device. I was not required to wear a\nmask, or gloves to enter the court room, nor was I offered any PPE.\n4. Before entering the courtroom, I noticed many detention center officers come and go from\nthe facility. I noticed that some officers were not screened by the front desk officers when\nthey entered the facility. They were allowed to enter without their temperature being taken.\n5. I was then escorted by a detention center officer to the video teleconference (VTC)\ncourtroom waiting area. The both the government’s attorney and the immigration judge\nwere each in respective separate rooms, and I was in the VTC courtroom with other\ndetainees. The waiting area in the VTC is best described as a small, narrow, hallway-like\narea with some chairs and two doors that lead to two different VTC courtrooms.

Attorneys were able to confer with their clients face-to-face \nand right next to each other. No one in the hallway wore masks. The only persons wearing \nPPE were the detention center guards—they wore gloves. \n6. The VTC courtroom itself is a room that is approximately 20 by 10 feet. Once inside the\ncourtroom,  I  was  asked  to  sit  next  to  my  client.  Inside  the  courtroom,  there  were\napproximately five to six additional detainees. All detainees in the courtroom were closer\nthan six feet from another person. No detainee was wearing any PPE.\n7. Counsel table, where attorneys and detainees sit, did not have hand sanitizer. As each\ndetainee was called up for their hearing, they sat at counsel table. When one hearing was\nadjourned, the next detainee, and counsel if present, were brought to the counsel table for\ntheir hearing. The counsel table or area was not wiped between hearings.\n8. Two days later, on April 2, 2020, I was at the NWIPC again and in the VTC courtrooms.\n9. When required to fill out a questionnaire and my temperature was taken. I was then cleared\nto enter the VTC hearing.\n10.Before entering the courtroom, I then asked the front desk officers for PPE, and stated that\nI was under the impression that PPE would be provided to attorneys when entering the\nfacility. One of the officers responded, “I didn’t hear anything like that, no one told us”\nand added that “things change all the time.” Eventually, I was offered gloves and a mask.\nAt that point, two other attorneys who were already sitting in the main waiting area, and\n2 \n\nCase 5:C1a7s-cev 2-0:2205-1c4v--J0G04B0-S9H-JKL R  -DMoAcTum   Denotc 2u6m0e-1n5t  8  3F i l eFdil e0d4 /0142//0230/ 2  0P  a Pgea g4e o 3f  5o f   4Page ID\n #:5653\nnot offered or wearing any PPE, requested gloves.

There were attorneys going in \nand out of the VTC courtroom area, some were not wearing any PPE. No detainee was \nwearing any PPE. In the VTC courtroom hallway, detainees were sitting next to each other. \nInside the courtroom, counsel table did not have hand sanitizer.

A. L.  \n \nI, A.A.L., declare as follows: \n \n1.  I have been detained at the GEO Detention Facility in Aurora, Colorado since January 6, \n2020.  \n \n2.  I am afraid of retribution for speaking out about what is happening at the detention \ncenter, but I am even more afraid of catching coronavirus, so I want to share information \nabout the conditions in Aurora.  \n \n3.  No one cleans in the dorms or common areas except us, the detainees. I personally clean \nas often as I am allowed because I really want to make sure I am as safe as possible since \nno other cleaning is provided.  \n \n4.  We are only allowed to clean common areas with disinfectant once per day and it is \notherwise locked away and we cannot access the cleaning materials.  \n \n5.  There is no disinfectant available for cleaning my cell and there has not been a cleaning \nat all of the cells at the GEO facility during my time there.  \n \n6.  There have been no town halls or educational meetings in my dorm. No medical \nprofessional has ever answered my questions about COVID-19.  \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-16   Filed 04/12/20   Page 3 of 4   Page ID\n #:5657\n \n7.  Our dorm is separated during time outside. Half of the population goes out at a time. \nEquipment is not sanitized or cleaned between the outside shifts.  \n \n8.  The majority of GEO staff I encounter on a daily basis do not wear personal protective \nequipment (PPE) which puts me at additional risk of exposure.  \n \n9.  My cellmate has a headache, runny nose, and is sneezing but he was only given Tylenol \nand saline and returned to the cell with me.  \n \n10. I have also had a sore throat and headache for days. When I went to medical, I was given \naspirin but was not tested for anything else.  \n \n11. Approximately two weeks ago, the dorm ran out of the limited gloves we have for \ncleaning. Additional gloves were provided to the dorm but the guard on duty refused to \nallow us access to the gloves. We couldn’t get more gloves until the shift changed and a \nnew guard came into the dorm.  \n \n12. I am very concerned about catching coronavirus in this detention center and what will \nhappen if I do get sick given the limited medical care provided.  \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-16   Filed 04/12/20   Page 4 of 4   Page ID\n #:5658\n13.

I have been detained at the GEO Detention Facility in Aurora, Colorado since March 6, \n2020.  \n \n2.  The coronavirus concerns really escalated immediately after I was detained and moved to \nthe Aurora Colorado GEO detention facility.  \n \n3.  Conditions at the Aurora detention facility are very unsanitary, and I am very concerned \nthat these conditions increase my risk of contracting coronavirus.  \n \n4.  There have been no town hall meetings or talks with medical professionals. Client reports \none doctor came into the dorm on one occasion and announced no detainees have been \ndiagnosed with coronavirus and left.  \n \n5.  While there are only two people in my cell, there is no way to remain six feet apart per \nsocial distancing guidelines in the space we have. We are therefore forced to violate these \nguidelines meant to protect us.   \n \n6.  There is no immediate access to disinfectant. We can only clean common areas once per \nday and there is only one bottle of disinfectant available for the entire dorm.  \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-17   Filed 04/12/20   Page 3 of 3   Page ID\n #:5661\n7.  There is one hand sanitizer unit available in my dorm, by the phone area. A video about \nhand washing plays in the phone area as well. We can only access that area when \nreceiving or making calls.   \n \n8.  Half of the dorm population goes outside at a time and there is no cleaning or sanitizing \nbetween population shifts.  \n \n9.  The majority of guards do not use PPE in the facility putting us at further risk of \ncontracting coronavirus.  \n \n10. I asked for a mask from a nurse at the detention facility and was told that the nurses don’t \neven have enough masks, so they certainly don’t have enough masks to give to the \ndetainees.  \n \n11. I am confined to my small cell with my cellmate for 23 hours per day. We get one hour \noutside of our cell.   \n \n12. As I am detained at the Aurora GEO detention center and cannot meet with my attorney \nin person, I have given my attorney, Christina A. Brown, permission to sign this \ndeclaration on my behalf via telephone.  \n \n \nRespectfully submitted this 10th day of April 2020.  \n \n_____________________________ \nChristina A.

I am afraid of contracting coronavirus at the detention facility and not being able to see \nmy family again.  \n \n3.  I am locked down in my cell with my cellmate for all but one hour per day. We spend 23 \nhours in a very small. Space together. It is impossible to be six feet apart from each other \nin this cell because of the space provided.  \n \n4.  I only have access to hand washing stations when I eats meals or when I use the \nbathroom.  \n \n5.  Most of the staff here do not wear PPE. Almost no one wears masks.   \n \n6.  Someone came to the dorm one time to answer questions about COVID-19.  It was a very \nbrief event, and it has not happened again.  \n \n7.  I would be embarrassed if my own home was as dirty as my cell here but we are not \ngiven supplies to clean our cells. This is where we spend almost all of our time.  \n \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-18   Filed 04/12/20   Page 3 of 3   Page ID\n #:5664\n8. My cellmate and I have body aches and pains and he is coughing but have not been tested\nfor COVID-19. I am very concerned now that I may have the virus.\n9.

If called as a witness, I could and would testify \ncompetently to the matters set forth below. \n \n2.  I am an attorney in private practice in Denver, Colorado.  \n \n3.  I practice before two immigration courts located in the state of Colorado. The non-\ndetained immigration court is located at 1961 Stout Street, Suite 300, Denver, CO 80294. The \ndetained court is located at 3130 N Oakland Street, Aurora, CO 80010.  \n \n4.  I currently have three clients detained at the Aurora Detention Center in Aurora, \nColorado. I will refer to them throughout this declaration as “A.A.L,” “B.R.M.,” and “D.H.M.” \nto protect their identities from public disclosure and to protect them from retaliation for sharing \nthe reality of what is happening inside the detention facility.  \n \n5.  A.A.L. has been detained since January 6, 2020. B.R.M. has been detained since \nMarch 6, 2020. D.H.M. has been detained since January 16, 2020.  \n \n6.  All three clients are imprisoned in different dormitories (dorms) in the GEO \ndetention facility in Aurora, Colorado.   \n \n7.  I represent all three of these detained individuals in their immigration proceedings. \nImmigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has my entry of appearance for each individual. I \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-19   Filed 04/12/20   Page 3 of 3   Page ID\n #:5667\nhave also entered my appearance before the Executive Office of Immigration Review for A.A.L. \nand D.H.M. I have an entry of appearance before the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals for B.R.M.  \n \n8.  Each of my clients has asked me to write a declaration on their behalf about \nconditions at the GEO detention facility in Aurora, Colorado using their initials because of their \nfear of contracting coronavirus.  \n \n9.  Each of my clients has given me permission to sign the declarations on their behalf \nas we cannot have contact visitation at this time at the facility. \n \n10.  Each of my clients requested to use initials because of fear of harm due to public \ndisclosure of their identities and due to fear of retaliation within the detention facility for \nspeaking out.  \n \n11.  Each of my clients would be willing to disclose their true identities upon an \nagreement with GEO to seal their declarations.  \n \nSubmitted this 10th day of April 2020.  \n \n \nBy:  _________________________ \n  Christina A.

CONLIN \nI, Francis L. Conlin, hereby declare under the penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746 \nthat the following is true and correct: \n1.  My name is Francis L. Conlin. I am the Chairperson for Friends of Miami-Dade Detainees \n(FOMDD). FOMMD is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that advocates for immigrants. Our \nmission is to end isolation, curb abuse, spread awareness, and end immigration detention. We \naccomplish our mission by operating visitation programs that offer friendship, a link to legal \nrepresentation, phone time, books, and other support to immigrants in detention.  \n2.  FOMDD  operates  visitation  programs  at  The  GEO  Group,  Inc.  (GEO)’s  Broward \nTransitional Center (BTC) in Pompano Beach, Florida, among other facilities. FOMDD has \noperated visitation programs for over six years and has conducted over 3,000 visits to people in \ndetention at BTC and the other two ICE detention facilities we serve. \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-20   Filed 04/12/20   Page 3 of 5   Page ID\n #:5670\n3.  All community visitation was suspended on March 13, 2020. Only legal visits are allowed \nuntil further notice. We are not permitted to bring in cleaning supplies, masks, gloves, or hand \nsanitizer.  \n4.  Even after the GEO/ICE lockout of visitors to BTC, FOMDD has been in daily contact \nwith people locked inside, and their families. \n5.  Based on FOMDD’s knowledge and understanding, derived from our daily calls with \npeople locked inside BTC and their families, GEO has failed to provide people locked inside BTC \nwith the vital, basic necessities they need to survive and be healthy amidst this pandemic. We have \nconsistently been in contact with detained immigrants at BTC who tells us they are without \nadequate access to soap, hot water, paper towels, and hand sanitizer.  \n6.  GEO prevents people inside BTC from practicing social distancing—the only known \nmeans of preventing transmission—by continuing to confine individuals in groups of dozens or \nlarger, with few opportunities for fresh air.  \n7.  GEO’s dorm cleaning program at BTC continues to require detained immigrants we serve \nto clean, disinfect, and sanitize their common living areas under threat of punishment.  \n8.  GEO has uniformly denied masks or other personal protective equipment to detained \nimmigrants at BTC who complete the daily cleaning tasks GEO forces them to do. \n9.  We continue to hear from people inside BTC that GEO is putting their health and safety at \nrisk by failing to test and cohort or quarantine individuals with symptoms of COVID-19. Without \nthis testing, we fear both symptomatic asymptomatic transmission of the virus to everyone in a \npod or dorm by people GEO forces to clean common areas. \n10. The population of BTC is currently hovering around approximately 700 people.  \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-20   Filed 04/12/20   Page 4 of 5   Page ID\n #:5671\n11. ICE and GEO have continued to bring new people there, and failed to significantly reduce \nthe size of the detained population. Specifically, on April 9, GEO accepted a transfer of detained \nimmigrants who were previously housed at the Krome Detention Facility in South Florida, where \nit has been confirmed that at least 238 ICE detainees were exposed to the virus.  \n12. On April 9, 2020, GEO officials at BTC cut off access to Univision – the main independent \nsource of news and information regarding COVID-19.  \n13. GEO guards continue to move in and out of the common living areas at BTC without \nwearing masks or gloves, thus needlessly exposing all of the people there to the COVID-19. \n14. Detained immigrants at BTC report people inside the facility who are confirmed or \npresumptive positive tests for COVID-19. FOMDD is aware of a Cuban man who reports being \nsent back to general population from isolation even after he reported tested positive. GEO has set \naside three rooms for of people for “observation” to monitor COVID-19 symptoms. After a certain \nperiod of time, the people in those rooms are sent to general population, with no consideration of \nthe possibility for asymptomatic spread, which constitutes 1 in 4 cases.  \n15. FOMDD has received consistent report of unsanitary conditions at BTC an inability or \nunwillingness of BTC to keep individuals healthy or well-nourished. Specifically, we have \nreceived reports that several bathrooms have run out of cleaning products, leaving them filthy and \nfunctionally unusable.  \n16. Detained immigrants at BTC have reported a chronic shortage of soap at BTC, leaving \nmany detained immigrants there unable to wash their hands in keeping with CDC protocols.  \n17. FOMDD has received consistent reports that all detained immigrants in a pod are using the \nsame phones without access to sanitation or disinfectant to clean them following each individual \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-20   Filed 04/12/20   Page 5 of 5   Page ID\n #:5672\nuse. Consequently, people are using socks to serve as barriers between their germs and those of \nthe people before them.  \n18. A 23-year-old woman with asthma and diabetes reported that staff made light of her \nillnesses and accused her of “wanting attention” and “putting on a show.” In detention, her \ncondition worsened, as she was given ibuprofen as her only treatment. \n19. For the reasons listed above, tensions at BTC are running extremely high. Rather than \nproviding PPE and adequate soap and sanitizer for all of the people confined there, GEO has \nbrought in a psychologist to convince detained immigrants that their fears of infection, illness, and \ndeath are normal. They are not. GEO is making a conscious choice to risk detainees’ lives by \nfailing to protect detained immigrants from exposure to the virus and forcing them to clean and \nmaintain their living areas without adequate protection and supplies. \n20. I hereby attest under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746 that the foregoing is \ntrue and correct, and I would testify as to the same if called to do so.  \n \nFrancis L. ‘Bud’ Conlin \nFriends of Miami-Dade Detainees \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-21   Filed 04/12/20   Page 1 of 6   Page ID\n #:5673\n \n \n \n \nEXHIBIT U \n\nCase 5:1C7a-csve- 032:2501-4c-vJ-G02B0-S64H-KM M  DCo  c uDmoceunmt 2e6n0t -2261- 8   F  iFleilde d0 40/31/23/12/02 0   P  aPgaeg e2  1o fo 6f  5  Page ID\n #:5674\n \n \n1  WILLIAM S.

My complete name is Lisa Veronica Knox. I am employed at Centro Legal de la Raza in \n3  Oakland, California as an Immigration Managing Attorney. I am pro bono counsel of record \n4  for Ms. Carolina del Carmen Espinoza Ayala (“Mr. Espinoza Ayala”) and Ms. Roxana del \n5  Carmen Trigueros Acevedo (“Ms. Trigueros Acevedo”). Ms. Trigueros Acevedo is a plaintiff in \n6  the instant Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and Motion for Temporary Restraining Order.  \n7  2.  The facts stated in this declaration are true and of my own personal knowledge, except as \n8  to any matters stated on information and belief, and as to those matters, I am informed and \n9  believed them to be true.  \n10  3.  I spoke with Ms. Espinoza Ayala on March 29, 2020. She reported that she and her wife \n11  Ms. Trigueros Acevedo continue to feel unwell. Since last week, she has developed a loud \n12  cough. During the call, she had to stop speaking in order to cough every few minutes. She also \n13  described having developed an allergy on her arms, legs and stomach. She stated that she has a \n14  rash and bumps on those areas. According to Ms. Espinoza Ayala, Ms. Trigueros Acevedo and \n15  several other women in their dormitory have the same rash and bumps. She stated that \n16  Ms. Trigueros Acevedo is experiencing a rapid heartbeat and sneezing and coughing, \n17  and continues to suffer from stomach issues.   \n18  4.  Ms. Espinoza Ayala stated that she and Ms. Trigueros Acevedo sent a written request to \n19  see a doctor to ICE and the facility nurse on Thursday, March 26. On Friday March 27 around \n20  12:30am, the nurse came into their dorm and took the clothes and sheets of everyone \n21  experiencing the allergy. While the women were given new sheets, not all women received new \n22  clothing. Ms. Espinoza Ayala said that she is still without a shirt. She was given a cream for her \n23  rash, but no other medication.   \n24  5.  On March 27, Ms. Espinoza Ayala asked the nurse if Ms. Trigueros Acevedo could be \n25  taken to see a doctor right away, due to her serious symptoms. The nurse replied that they were \n26  not the only people at the facility. She and Ms. Trigueros Acevedo have still not seen a doctor.   \n27 \n28 \n1 \n  SUPP. DECL. OF ATTORNEY LISA KNOX ISO PETITION FOR HABEAS CORPUS AND \nMOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 5:1C7a-csve- 032:2501-4c-vJ-G02B0-S64H-KM M  DCo  c uDmoceunmt 2e6n0t -2261- 8   F  iFleilde d0 40/31/23/12/02 0   P  aPgaeg e5  4o fo 6f  5  Page ID\n #:5677\n \n \n1  6.  According to Ms. Espinoza Ayala, officials instructed those in her dorm to maintain \n2  social distancing but that is impossible. She estimates that the beds in her dorm are spaced less \n3  than 1 meter (3.28 feet) apart. While she and Ms. Trigueros Acevedo were re-assigned beds so \n4  that two empty beds separate them, the majority of the women sleep in beds directly next to one \n5  another. When she needs to move around the dorm, for example to go to the bathroom, Ms. \n6  Espinoza Ayala states that she cannot help but pass very close by other women. She believes that \n7  it would be impossible to maintain the recommended 1.5-meter distance from other women in \n8  her dorm for more than short periods of time.   \n9  7.  Ms. Espinoza Ayala reports that people are constantly entering and leaving the dorm. \n10  Employees of the facility come and leave, and none other than the nurse has a mask. Ms. \n11  Espinoza Ayala said that one GEO employee has been constantly coughing, and is still walking \n12  around their dormitory with no mask or protective equipment. She also stated that two new \n13  detainees arrived to the dormitory late on the night of March 27. Given the time of their arrival, \n14  Ms. Espinoza Ayala believes they could not have seen a doctor before entering the dorm.   \n15  8.  Ms. Espinoza Ayala stated that the facility is only providing one small bar of \n16  soap, similar to that given at hotels, per day to each detainee. She and Ms. Trigueros Acevedo \n17  buy their own soap because the facility soap is of such poor quality. She stated that she and other \n18  women have to use shampoo to clean their clothes. The cleaning liquid provided to the women to \n19  clean the bathrooms is a creamy scented liquid that she believes is body wash. They have \n20  not received bleach or other disinfectant products.   \n21  9.  Ms. Espinoza Ayala’s dorm does not have windows that open to let in air. The only air \n22  that enters the room is from the air conditioning unit.   \n23  10.  Ms. Espinoza Ayala stated that she and the approximately 60 women in her dorm are \n24  very concerned about their health. There are three other women in the dorm who are coughing. \n25  One woman can’t even speak because of coughing fits. Women in her dorm who have gone to \n26  the medical area of the facility for blood pressure screening report that certain areas \n27 \n28 \n2 \n  SUPP. DECL.

Ms. Espinoza Ayala believes \n2  that there are already individuals infected with COVID-19 at the facility but has received no \n3  information from officials there.   \n4  11.  On March 27, 2020, I submitted a parole redetermination request for Ms. Espinoza Ayala \n5  and Ms. Trigueros Acevedo. Ms. Espinoza Ayala and Ms. Trigueros Acevedo were each granted \n6  a $4,000 bond. They remain in detention because their family is unable to pay the bonds.  \n7  12.

I am an Immigration Managing Attorney at Centro Legal de la Raza (“Centro Legal”), a \nnon-profit organization in San Francisco, California, that provides comprehensive services \nto immigrants, including legal services. In that role, I manage and regularly supervise a \ntwice-monthly legal services clinic at the Mesa Verde ICE Processing Center (“Mesa \nVerde”). In the past year, I have personally attended and supervised seven legal service \nclinics at the facility.  \n2.  The facts stated in this declaration are true and of my own personal knowledge, except as to \nany matters stated on information and belief, and as to those matters, I am informed and \nbelieve them to be true. \n3.  Centro Legal has provided legal services at the Mesa Verde facility since its opening in \napproximately 2015. I have regularly attended these visits since 2016. Centro Legal and its \npartner organizations currently conduct legal clinics in the facility’s second-floor cafeteria \narea. To enter the cafeteria area, staff pass by two men’s dormitories and another cafeteria \narea that is used for meals. All of these areas are visible through windows as staff pass by.  \n4.  In my experience, the Mesa Verde facility lacks the medical resources to be responsive to \neven basic medical issues. In June 2019, a case of chicken pox was confirmed at the \nfacility. This year alone, we have become aware of three cases in which ICE provided \ndetainees with the wrong medication. Additionally, we have spoken with several diabetic \nindividuals whose doctor-prescribed diet ICE refused to provide.  \n5.  In my observation, ICE at Mesa Verde is particularly ill-equipped to deal with \ncommunicable diseases. Though ICE reported only five detainees had been exposed to \nchicken pox in June 2019, many detainees believed they had been exposed through sharing \ndormitory and public space with the infected individuals. Detainees have consistently \nreported that the dormitory bathrooms regularly lack basic hygiene supplies, such as toilet \npaper and soap, needed to prevent the spread of communicable diseases.  \n6.  My most recent in-person visit to Mesa Verde occurred on Friday, March 13, 2020. Prior to \nthe visit, I requested that staff from my organization who were visiting the facility be \nallowed to bring hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes into the facility. I was told that no \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-22   Filed 04/12/20   Page 5 of 7   Page ID\n #:5683\n \none was allowed to bring in those items, and that only the cleaning supplies at the facility \ncould be used. There are no cleaning supplies or sink for handwashing available in the \nroom where we conduct visits, which also is one of two rooms where detained people eat \ntheir meals. \n7.  On the March 13, 2020 visit, we did not observe anyone—facility staff, detained people, or \nanyone else in the facility—wearing masks. No one asked our team of legal workers \nentering the facility about our health, including whether we were experiencing any \nsymptoms. We did not see any posted signs with information about COVID-19 or \nCoronavirus.  \n8.  Detained individuals reported that they received information verbally during a group \npresentation earlier in the week--they were instructed to wash their hands with soap, they \nwere provided with bleach-based cleaning solution for the first time, they were instructed \nto cough and sneeze into their elbows, and they were told to report any flu-like symptoms \nright away. Despite the instructions to use soap, at the time of our visit some detainees \nreported that they had not received free soap. I was concerned that the staff mentioned they \nwere already running out of masks, that detainees reported that new detainees were being \nmixed in with the general population without any mandatory quarantine period (since we \nknow the virus can remain dormant for many days or even be carried by asymptomatic \ncarriers), and that so many individuals with pre-existing conditions that put them at high \nrisk remain in detention. \n9.  The Mesa Verde facility is an extremely small space where in my observation detainees are \ncontinuously in close contact with staff and one another. The facility has four larger \ndormitory spaces that each house around 100 detainees During our visits, I have observed \nthat the detainees sleep in bunkbeds that are spaced only a few feet apart. Detainees have \nreported that they spend all but a few hours a day in the dorm space. Meals are eaten in a \ncommon cafeteria space, where I have observed that detainees sit four to a table on bench \nseats spaced a few feet apart. In my observation and experience spending time in this room, \nit would be extremely difficult for a detainee to maintain the recommended six feet of \nsocial distancing in these spaces for any amount of time. My understanding is that there are \nfewer than five isolation cells available in the facility. In my experience, these cells are \nusually filled with individuals with chronic mental health conditions or individuals being \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-22   Filed 04/12/20   Page 6 of 7   Page ID\n #:5684\n \nisolated for disciplinary reasons.  \n10. During the March 13, 2020 visit, detainees were seated at tables that seat four people per \ntable, which clearly do not allow for 6 feet of space in between people. Detainees were not \ninstructed to sit farther apart. Detainees reported that they eat meals at the same sized tables \nthat seat four people per table, which clearly do not allow for 6 feet of space in between \npeople. \n11. Detainees have regularly reported unsanitary conditions at the facility. Detainees have \nconsistently reported that there is not sufficient soap or shampoo in the shower stalls. They \nare forced to pay as much as $10 for a bottle of shampoo in the commissary. As a result, \nmany who cannot afford these exorbitant prices are forced to shower without soap or \nshampoo. Detainees who clean bathrooms have reported that they regularly run out of \ndisinfectant, and are forced to clean with only water.  \n12. Detainees have reported that the only regular cleaning that occurs within the dorm consists \nof sweeping and mopping the floors. Detainees are responsible for cleaning their own bunk \nbed areas, and to do so, they share the same rag and pass it from detainee to detainee.  \n13. On March 13, 2020, no sanitation precautions were taken that could be observed by the \nlegal worker team. There was no evidence that surfaces were cleaned between the times \nthat each housing unit was brought into the room for legal services. Neither the detained \npeople nor the legal workers had any access to any materials to sanitize surfaces or hands \nduring the day. The only way that legal workers could wash their hands was to request to \nreturn to the restrooms in the lobby. Detained individuals reported they did have access to \nshared bar soap in the bathroom areas of their housing units for hand washing. It did not \nappear that the detainees had access to hand washing in the room where the legal services \nwere provided on March 13, 2020. \n14. On the March 13 visit, many detainees reported worry about the lack of screening of new \narrivals to the detention center, as well as concerns about the cleaning of services. One \nindividual reported that showers were being cleaned with soap.  \n15. On March 19, one of our clients informed us that the conditions described above had not \nchanged. Detainees still share the same rag to clean and wipe down their sleeping areas. \nThey still are not physically able to keep a 6 foot distance from one another for any \nsignificant period of time. Detention personnel do not wear masks, and only some wear \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-22   Filed 04/12/20   Page 7 of 7   Page ID\n #:5685\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-23   Filed 04/12/20   Page 1 of 19   Page ID\n #:5686\n \n \n \n \nEXHIBIT W \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-23   Filed 04/12/20   Page 2 of 19   Page ID\n #:5687\n \n \n1  WILLIAM FREEMAN (SBN 82002)  MANOHAR RAJU  \nwfreeman@aclunc.org  Public Defender     \n2  SEAN RIORDAN (SBN 255752)  MATT GONZALEZ \nsriordan@aclunc.org  Chief Attorney \n3  ANGÉLICA SALCEDA (SBN 296152)  FRANCISCO UGARTE (CA SBN 241710) \nasalceda@aclunc.org  francisco.ugarte@sfgov.orga \n4  AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION   GENNA ELLIS BEIER (CA SBN 300505) \nFOUNDATION OF NORTHERN  genna.beier@sfgov.org \n5  CALIFORNIA   EMILOU H.

I served for four years as a medical subject matter \nexpert for the Officer of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, U.S. Department of Homeland \nSecurity, and as a medical subject matter expert for one year for the California Attorney \nGeneral’s  division  responsible  for  monitoring  the  conditions  of  confinement  in \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facilities. I have also served as \na consultant to Human Rights Watch in their preparation of two reports on health-\nrelated conditions of confinement in ICE detention facilities. In those capacities, I have \nvisited and examined more than 20 ICE detention facilities and reviewed hundreds of \nrecords, including medical records and detention death reviews of individuals in ICE \ndetention. Attached as Exhibit A is a copy of my curriculum vitae. \n \n2.  COVID-19 is a serious disease and has reached pandemic status. It is straining the \nhealth care systems around the world, including in areas where there is high-quality \nand well-resourced health care. At least 240,000 people around the world have received \nconfirmed diagnoses of COVID 19, including 18,000 people in the United States. At \nleast 9,000 people have died globally as a result of COVID-19, including more than \n250 in the United States. These numbers will increase, perhaps exponentially. \n \n3.  COVID-19 is a novel virus. There is no vaccine for COVID-19, and there is no cure \nfor COVID-19. No one has prior immunity. The only way to control the virus is to use \npreventive strategies, including social distancing.  \n \n4.  The time course of the disease can be very rapid. Individuals can show the first \nsymptoms of infection in as little as two days after exposure and their condition can \nseriously deteriorate in as little as five days (perhaps sooner) after that. It is believed \nthat people can transmit the virus without being symptomatic and, indeed, that a \nsignificant  amount  of  transmission  may  be  from  people  who  are  infected  but \nasymptomatic or pre-symptomatic.   \n \n5.  The  effects  of  COVID-19  are  very  serious,  especially  for  people  who  are  most \nvulnerable. Vulnerable people include people over the age of 50, and those of any age \nwith underlying health problems such as – but not limited to – weakened immune \nsystems, hypertension, diabetes, blood, lung, kidney, heart, and liver disease, and \npossibly pregnancy.   \n \n6.  Vulnerable people who are infected by the COVID-19 virus can experience severe \nrespiratory illness, as well as damage to other major organs. Treatment for serious cases \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-23   Filed 04/12/20   Page 5 of 19   Page ID\n #:5690\nof COVID-19 requires significant advanced support, including ventilator assistance for \nrespiration and intensive care support. An outbreak of COVID-19 could put significant \npressure on or exceed the capacity of local health infrastructure.  \n \n7.  Detention facilities are congregate environments, i.e. places where people live and \nsleep in close proximity. Social distancing in ways that are recommended by public \nhealth officials can be difficult, if not impossible in congregate environments such as  \ndetention facilities. To the extent that detainees are housed in close quarters, unable to \nmaintain a six-foot distance from others, and sharing or touching objects used by others, \ninfectious diseases that are transmitted via the air or touch are more likely to spread,  \nplacing people at risk. This is especially true when the number of detainees is high.  \nFor these reasons, if – but more likely when – COVID-19 is introduced into the facility, \nthe risks of spread is greatly, if not exponentially, increased as already evidenced by \nspread of COVID-19 in two other congregate environments: nursing homes and cruise \nships. \n8.  I have reviewed the declarations of Kathleen Kavanagh and Lisa Knox, attorneys who \nvisited Yuba County Jail (“Yuba”) and Mesa Verde ICE Processing Center (“Mesa \nVerde”), respectively. If the facts revealed in their declarations are true, living \nconditions at Yuba and Mesa Verde are typical congregate environments where \ndetainees sleep in large groups with less than six feet of spacing between beds. \nFurther, at Mesa Verde meals are currently served in group settings, also with less \nthat six feet of spacing between detainees. This spacing is not consistent with CDC’s \nrecommendation for adequate social distancing.  \n \n9.  In addition to the above conditions dictated by the physical plants and population size \nat these facilities, based on the information in one declaration, Mesa Verde is failing \nto implement COVID-19 infection control measures recommended by the CDC. For \nexample, the declarant noted: there were no cleaning supplies or sink for \nhandwashing in or near the room used for legal visits; Mesa Verde staff neglected to \nscreen the legal team for risk of carriage of COVID-19 prior to granting them entry; \nsome detainees have not received free soap for handwashing; detainees are forced to \nshare the same rag for cleaning their rooms; and there was no regular disinfection of \ntransactional surfaces in the dormitory. \n \n10.  In addition to the increased risk from COVID-19 to any individual in the detention \ncenter, there is an especially increased risk of harm to the elderly and detainees with \nunderlying health conditions. They are not only more likely to become seriously ill, \nbut also, therefore, more likely to require transport to a community hospital. \n \n11.  For these reasons, I recommend immediate consideration of downsizing of these \ndetention facilities, with priority given to those in high risk of harm due to their age \nand health status. \n \n12.  There are two values to immediate downsizing. First, downsizing will reduce the \ndensity of congregation. This will allow people in detention to maintain better social \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-23   Filed 04/12/20   Page 6 of 19   Page ID\n #:5691\ndistancing. The reduction in population will also make it easier for detention \nauthorities to implement infection prevention measures such as: provision of cleaning \nsupplies to residents; frequent laundering of towels and clothes; provision of soap for \nhandwashing; frequent cleaning of transactional surfaces; frequent showers; etc.  The \nreduction in population while implementing these enhanced measures helps prevent \noverloading the work of detention staff such that they can continue to ensure the \nsafety of detainees. All these steps can slow or stop the spread of infection, to the \nbenefit of residents and staff (and family and friends of staff). \n \n13.  Second, immediate downsizing that prioritizes residents who are elderly and those \nwith underlying health conditions reduces the likelihood they will contract the \ndisease. Individuals in these groups are at the highest risk of severe complications \nfrom COVID-19 and when they develop severe complications they will be \ntransported to community hospitals. Carceral and detention settings, regardless of the \nlevel of government authorities that oversee them, are integral parts of the \ncommunity’s public health infrastructure. Reducing the spread and severity of \ninfection in a federal immigration detention center slows, if not reduces, the number \nof people who will become ill enough to require hospitalization where they will be \nusing scarce community resources (ER beds, general hospital beds, ICU beds) which \nin turn reduces the health and economic burden to the local community at large.  \n \n14.  In addition to recommending immediate downsizing, I also recommend that the \ndetention facilities begin planning now to downsize further as conditions change. The \nchange in conditions we need to anticipate is reduction in workforce (custody and \nhealth care staff) as workers respond to their personal needs (self-quarantine or \nisolation, caring for ill relatives, staying home with school-age children). Insufficient \ncustody staffing poses an obvious risk to the safety of the institution. Insufficient \nhealth care staffing poses an obvious risk to the health of residents. \n \n15.  If the information presented in the two aforementioned declarations is true, the health \ncare delivery systems at Yuba and Mesa Verde may be substandard. For example, at \nYuba, treatment of a patient with cancer and another patient with traumatic injuries \nwas significantly delayed. Other patients report lack of attention for medical \nconditions despite multiple requests for care. At Mesa Verde, three patients were \nprovided with incorrect medications and several diabetic patients were denied special \ndiets ordered by their physician. Successful monitoring and treatment of patients for \npossible or confirmed COVID-19 relies on an already satisfactorily operating health \ncare system. If those core systems are substandard at Yuba and Mesa Verde, then it is \nmore likely than not that monitoring and treatment for COVID-19 will be inadequate \nand therefore dangerous. \n \n16.  Even if the quality of health care being provided to individuals at Mesa Verde and \nYuba are not substandard and meet or exceed the community standard of care, my  \nrecommendations herein would be unchanged. The risks to which detainees at these \ntwo facilities are exposed stem from the congregate nature of the environment and, \nfor the elderly and chronically ill, from their medical histories. Thus even if the health \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-23   Filed 04/12/20   Page 7 of 19   Page ID\n #:5692\ncare being provided were excellent, there would still be substantial risk; if the health \nbeing provided were substandard, those substantial risks are only greater. \n \n17.  Thus, in summary, reducing the number of individuals in detention at Mesa Verde \nand Yuba County Jail immediately, with plans made for further reductions as staffing \nlevels change, is necessary for the health and safety of the detention centers and our \ncommunities. \n \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. \nExecuted this 22nd day in March, 2020 in Tumwater, Washington. \n \n \n_____________________ \nDr. Marc Stern  \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-23   Filed 04/12/20   Page 8 of 19   Page ID\n #:5693\nMARC F.

My name is Juan Carlos Minchaca Ramos and I am 44 years old. I am a citizen of \n2  Mexico. My A Number is 200-865-245. My mother and my two daughters, ages 12 and 13, are \n3  U.S. citizens.  \n4  2.  I submit this declaration in support of a multi-plaintiff petition for a writ of habeas corpus \n5  in federal court based on the risks that I and others face because of COVID-19. \n6  3.  I have been detained at Mesa Verde ICE Processing Facility (Mesa Verde) since \n7  December 19, 2019, when ICE arrested me after I completed my state prison sentence. I was \n8  convicted of having sex with someone underage more than four years ago.  \n9  4.  My immigration case is currently before Immigration Judge Nelson.  I am afraid to go \n10  back to Mexico and I am asking for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the \n11  Convention Against Torture.  I am also eligible for a green card though my U.S. citizen mother, \n12  who already filed a petition for me.  I will be asking the Immigration Judge to grant my \n13  application for adjustment of status with a waiver.  My daughters would face great hardship if I \n14  were deported.  My eldest daughter, Melanie, age 13, has a learning disability and is in Special \n15  Education at school.  My younger daughter, Jasyln, age 12, has had health problems in the past \n16  including the removal of tumors from her ovaries as well as the removal of her ovary.  \n17  5.  My next master calendar hearing before the Immigration Judge is currently scheduled for \n18  March 31, 2020.  That date is for me to submit my application for a waiver.  I am represented in \n19  my case by Jennifer Friedman from the San Francisco Public Defenders Office. \n20  6.  I am currently sick and have not received adequate medical attention at Mesa Verde, in \n21  light of COVID-19.  I started to not feel well on Thursday, March 12th.  On Friday, March 13th, \n22  I told one of the officials that I was ill and had a fever.  They told me to put in a request, but that \n23  it takes three days to process and there was nothing he could.  I asked if he could make it a \n24  priority since I was worried about Coronavirus, but they said no. I submitted the medical request \n25  on Saturday March 14th. I resubmitted it again on Sunday March 15th saying I was really sick. \n26  7.  On Monday, March 16th, they called me to medical for a check-up.  I informed the nurse \n27  that I had a fever, a runny nose, body aches, chills, and that my whole body was sore.  The nurse \n28 \n3 \nDECLARATION OF JUAN CARLOS MINCHACA RAMOS IN SUPPORT OF PETITION FOR HABEAS \n \nCORPUS AND MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-24   Filed 04/12/20   Page 5 of 7   Page ID\n #:5709\n \n \n1  checked me and said I was fine, that it was just the regular flu.  Although I was told that I didn’t \n2  have a temperature then, I felt like I had had one the night before.  They did not test me for the \n3  coronavirus.  I asked about coronavirus, and they said not to worry about it.  The nurse gave me \n4  a pill for allergies, as well as Tylenol.  She didn’t say anything about being careful or precautions \n5  I should take, but rather she just sent me back to my bunk with everyone else.  I asked her for a \n6  mask, and she said they didn’t have any. \n7  8.  The next day, the medication nurse gave me 2 Tylenols and the allergy pill.  I’ve been \n8  taking that ever since, two times a day, but my symptoms have not improved. \n9  9.  I submitted another medical request because of a rash I have on the back of my head, on \n10  my scalp, neck, and back.   The day after my check-up, I was called in again by the nurse.  I had \n11  seen the doctor about the rash previously, before I got sick with the flu, and they gave me \n12  antibiotics.  They called me for a follow-up on the rash because it wasn’t going away, and they \n13  called me back in.  The rash itches and white liquid is coming out.  I’ve never had anything like \n14  this, I think it’s a result of the lack of hygiene in here.  They gave me the antibiotic for the rash.  \n15  10.  Since my check-up, they haven’t called me back for a follow-up. They haven’t taken my \n16  temperature again, or checked my other symptoms which I still have. \n17  11.  They said they were going to start testing us for the coronavirus, but they haven’t. They \n18  aren’t doing anything. I don’t know if I have coronavirus or not. \n19  12.  I’m in the D Dorm and there are about 80 or 90 people in here, and we are all housed \n20  very close together.  Mesa Verde staff comes and goes.  There is no way to stay away from \n21  people.  Everywhere you go, there are people.  They are still bringing new people in here from \n22  the outside.  As soon as they deport 5 or 6 people, they replace them right away.  All the people \n23  around me, plus the constant movement of people in and out make it impossible to control who is \n24  around me.  \n25  13.  Last week, all those in my dorm got together and wrote a group letter to GEO saying that \n26  it doesn’t make sense that they cancelled our family visits, yet they aren’t taking the precautions \n27  necessary to protect us from the coronavirus.  In our letter we highlighted our concern that there \n28 \n4 \nDECLARATION OF JUAN CARLOS MINCHACA RAMOS IN SUPPORT OF PETITION FOR HABEAS \n \nCORPUS AND MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-24   Filed 04/12/20   Page 6 of 7   Page ID\n #:5710\n \n \n1  are all kinds of people coming into our dorm, new detainees as well as the constant movement of \n2  Mesa Verde staff, that can expose us to the coronavirus.  They never responded to our letter.  We \n3  are very worried about these new detainees from the outside.  I’ve talked to the new detainees \n4  who are arriving, they are coming from the street and the detention center just checks their vitals \n5  before they come into the dorms—they aren’t testing for the coronavirus and they could be \n6  carrying it. \n7  14.  I work to help clean the dorm, the cabinets, phones, floors.  I do it five days a week.  But \n8  I am not able to disinfect everything, we try our best to keep it clean but with all the people \n9  coming in and out, I know it is not enough.  \n10  15.  I do not feel like my health is safe here because of the coronavirus and these rashes that I \n11  have.  They aren’t paying close enough attention to my health and the treatment they are giving \n12  me isn’t enough. I don’t think it’s safe. My bed is two feet from other beds in all directions, so \n13  there is no way to stay six feet away from people. \n14  16.  I’ve had the flu for over a week now and I’m still sick.  I feel the worst right around the \n15  evening, I feel like I have a fever at night every night.  Sometimes I sweat a lot during the \n16  nighttime; so much that I have to change my shirt because I’m soaked in my own sweat.  I feel \n17  like my tonsils are swollen.  My throat hurts a lot at night and in the morning.  My bones hurt \n18  inside, and sometimes at night I cough. \n19  17.  I would feel much safer if I returned home pending the outcome of my case.  If I were \n20  released, I would stay with my cousin in Montclair, CA. I would comply with my probation \n21  requirements, including all necessary monitoring. \n22  18.  If I were at home, I would be able to limit my contact with other people.  If a doctor told \n23  me that I needed to self-isolate at home, I could have my own room and my own restroom to \n24  avoid contact with others until I receive clearance from health professionals.  I would be more \n25  than willing to follow any instructions or orders in place regarding social distancing from others, \n26  and sheltering in place. \n27 \n \n28 \n5 \nDECLARATION OF JUAN CARLOS MINCHACA RAMOS IN SUPPORT OF PETITION FOR HABEAS \n \nCORPUS AND MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-24   Filed 04/12/20   Page 7 of 7   Page ID\n #:5711\n \n \n1   \n2 \nAffirmation \n3 \nI, Jennifer T.

My name is Claude Bent. I am providing this declaration to describe the conditions I am \nfacing in detention right now. I am very afraid for my health and my life because of the \nCOVID-19 virus. \n \n2.  I am detained in Mesa Verde Detention Facility in Pod C, which is a dormitory section \nthat has room for 100 men. This morning I checked how many people there are, and \nthere are 91 men in the pod. My lawyer has told me that I should do everything I can to \nstay far apart from people, especially people who are coughing, but that is impossible \nhere. The pod is crowded, and when we all go to eat, it is even more crowded—we are \nall so close together we are almost touching. In the past few days, I have heard a lot of \ncoughing from other men in the pod, which scares me a lot. I have tried to stay positive, \nbut lately it feels like we are trapped in a death box. \n \n3.  My asthma is pretty bad. I have noticed that when I talk on the phone for more than a \nfew minutes, my voice feels strained and it is harder for me to breathe. I am scared of \nwhat could happen to me if I become very sick, since in the past when I have been sick \nand asked for medical attention, it has usually taken three or four days before I received \nthis attention.  \n \n4.  I have seen a few changes here because of COVID-19, but these changes do not give me \nconfidence that I am safe here. A few days ago, a nurse came by with a small machine to \ntake all of our temperatures. She rubbed the machine up against my forehead, right after \nI saw her do the same thing to the detainee whose temperature she took before mine. She \ndid not even wipe the machine off between us. I told her I did not think she was \nsupposed to actually touch the machine to my head, and she smiled and said that I was \nprobably right. This scared me, since if anyone who had their temperature taken before \nme had the virus, I would be in even more risk now. This makes me think that even the \nmedical staff here is not taking the virus seriously. I have also seen a few staff members \nwearing masks, but not many people. Detainees do not have masks. \n \n5.  Other detainees and I are very scared, and we have asked for supplies to help make us \nsafer, like hand sanitizer and liquid soap. We have not been given either of these supplies \nthough. \n \n \n   \n\nCase 5:1C7a-csve- 042:1591-4c-vJ-G06B1-S23H-KD M  DRo  c Dumoceunmt 2e6n0t -2235- 2   F  iFleilde d0 40/41/20/32/02 0   P  Pagaeg e3  2o fo 3f  2  Page ID\n #:5714\n \nCertificate of Interpretation and Affirmation \nI, Evelyn Wiese, certify that on April 2, 2020, I read the foregoing to Claude Bent and that he \naffirmed that the foregoing is true and correct.

I am a Managing Attorney at the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal \nServices (RAICES) in Houston, Texas. In this capacity, I supervise RAICES attorneys, legal \nworkers, and staff who provide immigration legal services to migrants and refugees detained at \nThe GEO Group, Inc. (GEO)’s Montgomery ICE Processing Center (hereafter “Montgomery”) \nand Joe Corley Detention Facility (hereafter “Corley”), both of which are located in Conroe, \nTexas.  \n2.  RAICES operates with four attorneys at the facility who weekly visit the facility to \nmeet with clients. We have met with clients in visitation rooms that allow us contact with them. \nHowever, due to the current pandemic, we have started meeting with clients through telephone.  \n \nCHRONIC  SHORTAGES  OF  BASIC  NECESSITIES  PLAGUE  GEO’S \nFACILITIES \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 260-27   Filed 04/12/20   Page 3 of 4   Page ID\n #:5722\n3.   Our clients have uniformly reported severe shortages of the basic necessities required to \nmaintain their hygienic and sanitary living conditions at the Montgomery, and Corley facilities.  \n4.  Specifically, at both facilities, we have received persistent complaints of inadequate \nsupplies of soap, sanitizer, shampoo, disinfectant, they have complained that there is no possibility \nof safe social distancing and lack of masks, in spite of having detainees who have tested positive \nat their dorms. \nCLASS MEMBERS CANNOT SOCIALLY DISTANCE IN GEO’S FACILITIES \n5.  Class Members at Montgomery, and Corley are physically unable to maintain social \ndistancing  guidelines  recommended  by  the  CDC.  That  is  because  each  facility  imprisons \nindividuals in congregate environments: They are either confined in small cells with 1-3 other \ndetained immigrants, only to congregate with 60-120 others during recreation or mealtime, or \nbecause they live in large, open-air dorms with bunk beds only feet apart.  RAICES attorneys have \nobserved conditions on tours inside the living areas of these each facilities.  \n6.  Making matters even more dangerous for our clients and other Class Members, GEO \ncontinues to accept newly admitted detained immigrants at each facility, and has failed to conduct \nsustained medical surveillance and testing of the human beings in its care.  \nGEO DENIES CLASS MEMBERS PPE WHEN THEY CLEAN COMMON AREAS \n7.  Despite  the  demonstrated  risk  of  contracting  COVID-19  from  dirty  surfaces,  GEO \ncontinues to require detained immigrants at the Montgomery, and Corley facilities to clean and \nsanitize their common living areas.  \n8.  At these Texas GEO facilities, our clients have demanded GEO provide them with personal \nprotective equipment such as masks, gloves, and eyewear to minimize their risk of infection.

This motion \n12  is made following the conference of counsel pursuant to L.R. 7-3 which took place on \n13  April 6, 2020.  \n14  As requested in the concurrently filed Ex Parte Application for TRO,  Plaintiffs \n15  respectfully request that the Court hear this motion at the same time as it hears argument \n16  regarding the TRO.\n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n2 \nPLAINTIFFS’ NOTICE OF MOTION   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \n \n`   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 254   Filed 04/06/20   Page 3 of 11   Page ID #:5179\nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR EXPEDITED DISCOVERY IN SUPPORT \n1 \nOF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n2 \nPlaintiffs represent a certified class of civil immigration detainees who perform \n3 \nsanitation services and other work pursuant to the Housing Unit Sanitation Policy \n4 \n(“HUSP”)  applied  by  defendant  The  GEO  Group,  Inc.  (“GEO”)  at  its  detention \n5 \nfacilities across the country.  \n6 \nBecause of the imminent and irreparable harm Plaintiffs face from participating \n7 \nin the HUSP program without sufficient protective safeguards and equipment, Plaintiffs \n8 \nhave moved for a temporary restraining order, and will seek a preliminary injunction, \n9 \nasking that this Court require GEO to either (a) immediately halt the use of class \n10 \nmembers in the provision of work or services under the HUSP program, or (b) at least \n11 \nequip  those  detainees  who  provide  HUSP  services  with  protective  clothing  and \n12 \nantiseptic supplies, and to conduct weekly testing of all such class members to detect \n13 \nand protect against the threat of death or serious illness from Coronavirus Disease 2019 \n14 \n(“COVID-19”). \n15 \nPlaintiffs herein seek an order granting expedited discovery on a limited, targeted \n16 \nset of issues that relate directly to the preliminary injunction: the efforts GEO has taken \n17 \nto assess, monitor, and protect Plaintiff class members from contracting COVID-19 \n18 \nwhile  participating  in  the  HUSP  program.  Plaintiffs  request  that  GEO  produce \n19 \nresponses to the interrogatories and requests for admission included in Exhibit A hereto \n20 \nwithin 4 calendar days, and that GEO make available a representative to testify to the \n21 \ntopics presented in Exhibit B hereto within 9 calendar days, after service of this motion. \n22 \nI.    Good Cause Exists to Grant Plaintiffs’ Request for Expedited Discovery. \n23 \n“Expedited discovery has been ordered where it would ‘better enable the court to \n24 \njudge  the  parties’  interests  and  respective  chances  for  success  on  the  merits’  at  a \n25 \npreliminary injunction hearing.” Yokohama Tire Corp. v. Dealers Tire Supply, Inc., 202 F.R.D. \n26 \n3  \nMOTION FOR EXPEDITED DISCOVERY IN   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \nSUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n \n`   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 254   Filed 04/06/20   Page 4 of 11   Page ID #:5180\n1  612, 613 (D. Ariz. 2001) (quoting Edudata Corp. v. Sci. Computs., Inc., 599 F. Supp. 1084, \n2  1088 (D. Minn. 1984) (stating expedited discovery “better enable[s] the court to judge \n3  the parties’ interest and respective chances for success on the merits”); see also Rodale, Inc. \n4  v. U.S. Preventive Med., Inc., No. 08-cv-120, 2008 WL 4682043, at *1 (E.D. Tex. Oct. 21, \n5  2008) (noting “An order for expedited discovery would be appropriate in a case seeking \n6  a preliminary injunction.”); Ellsworth Assocs., Inc. v. United States, 917 F. Supp. 841, 844 \n7  (D.D.C. 1996) (“Expedited discovery is particularly appropriate when a plaintiff seeks \n8  injunctive relief because of the expedited nature of injunctive proceedings.”); Advisory \n9  Committee Note, Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(d) (1993) (noting expedited discovery “will be \n10  appropriate  in  some  cases,  such  as  those  involving  requests  for  a  preliminary \n11  injunction”). \n12  “[D]istrict courts in this Circuit have allowed expedited discovery prior to the \n13  Rule 26(f) conference upon a showing of good cause. Good cause may be found where \n14  the need for expedited discovery, in consideration of the administration of justice, \n15  outweighs the prejudice to the responding party. The good cause assessment is based on \n16  the entirety of the record [and] the reasonableness of the request in light of all the \n17  surrounding circumstances.  In evaluating the reasonableness of a request for expedited \n18  discovery, courts consider the following factors: (1) whether a preliminary injunction is \n19  pending; (2) the breadth of the discovery requests; (3) the purpose for seeking expedited \n20  discovery; (4) the burden on defendants of complying with the requests; and (5) how far \n21  in advance of formal discovery process the request is made.  \n22  BDMR Holdings, LTD. v. Does, No. CV 19-9856-VSP (KSX), 2019 WL 7865178, \n23  at *1–2 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 10, 2019). The record supports Plaintiffs’ request for expedited \n24  discovery. \n25  A. A motion for temporary restraining order has been filed and a motion \nfor a preliminary injunction is imminent. \n26 \n4  \nMOTION FOR EXPEDITED DISCOVERY IN   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \nSUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n \n`   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 254   Filed 04/06/20   Page 5 of 11   Page ID #:5181\n1  Contemporaneously with this motion Plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary \n2  restraining order, and Plaintiffs will seek a preliminary injunction immediately following \n3  the ruling on the requested TRO. This factor supports granting the instant motion so \n4  that the information developed can be considered by the imminent injunction request. \n5  B. The  discovery  requests  are  limited  and  focused  on  issues  directly \nrelevant to determining the preliminary injunction. \n6 \nA review of the discovery sought by Plaintiffs confirm they are directly relevant \n7 \nto the issues to be addressed at the preliminary injunction hearing. Semitool, Inc. v. Tokyo \n8 \nElectron Am., Inc., 208 F.R.D. 273, 276 (N.D. Cal. 2002). Plaintiffs here seek answers to \n9 \ninterrogatories and requests for admission regarding the procedures and protections \n10 \naccorded Class Members who are currently participating in the HUSP program against \n11 \nthe  risk  of  contracting  COVID-19;  the  single  focus  of  the  TRO  and  preliminary \n12 \ninjunction requests.  \n13 \nAs  the  U.S.  Centers  For  Disease  Control  has  noted,  “There  are  many \n14 \nopportunities for COVID-19 to be introduced into a correctional or detention facility, \n15 \nincluding  daily  staff  ingress  and  egress;  transfer  of  incarcerated/detained  persons \n16 \nbetween facilities and systems, to court appearances, and to outside medical visits; and \n17 \nvisits from family, legal representatives, and other community members. Some settings, \n18 \nparticularly jails and detention centers, have high turnover, admitting new entrants daily \n19 \nwho may have been exposed to COVID-19 in the surrounding community or other \n20 \nregions.”1 The limited discovery is needed because the ability of Class Members “to \n21 \nexercise disease prevention measures (e.g., frequent handwashing) may be limited and is \n22 \n23 \n \n24  1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in its Interim Guidance on Management of \nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities, available at \n25 \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-\ndetention/guidance-correctional-detention.html. \n26 \n5  \nMOTION FOR EXPEDITED DISCOVERY IN   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \nSUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n \n`   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 254   Filed 04/06/20   Page 6 of 11   Page ID #:5182\n1  determined by the supplies provided in the facility and by security considerations.”2 This \n2  factor supports granting Plaintiffs’ motion \n3  C. Expedited  discovery  is  sought  to  obtain  information  that  cannot  be \ndeveloped  in  any  other  manner  to  address  the  coming  motion  for \n4 \npreliminary injunction. \n5 \nThere is no other avenue to obtain information regarding the measures GEO has \n6 \nimplemented at its detention facilities to protect Class members participating in the \n7 \nHUSP program from contracting COVID-19 except getting that information from \n8 \nGEO itself. See, e.g., In re Elcommerce.com, Inc., No. 10-51396, 2011 WL 237619, at *2 (E.D. \n9 \nMich. Jan. 24, 2011) (granting motion to compel production where information was only \n10 \navailable from the subpoenaed third party). This factor also supports granting Plaintiffs’ \n11 \nmotion. \n12 \nD. The burden on GEO to comply with the requests is minimal. \n13 \n14  The requested discovery consists of answers to eight (8) interrogatories and \n15  twenty-nine  (29)  requests  for  admissions,  and  a  corporate  representative  to  give \n16  testimony on twelve (12) topics—all of which are directly relevant to the determination \n17  of Plaintiffs’ motion for injunctive relief. In the current circumstance, any burden on \n18  GEO to answer a few questions about the effort it is (or is not) putting forth to protect \n19  Class Members is far outweighed by the threat of harm to Plaintiffs, including the \n20  potential for serious illness and death. See, e.g., Semitool, Inc. v. Tokyo Electron Am., Inc., 208 \n21  F.R.D.  273,  277  (N.D.  Cal.  2002)  (“While  Defendants  claim  some  logistical \n22  inconvenience in responding to the request inasmuch as most of the documents are \n23  located in Japan and many may be in Japanese, the Court fails to see why given current \n24  communication technology, Defendants cannot respond quickly to the narrow requests \n25 \n \n2 Id. \n26 \n6  \nMOTION FOR EXPEDITED DISCOVERY IN   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \nSUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n \n`   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 254   Filed 04/06/20   Page 7 of 11   Page ID #:5183\n1  propounded by Plaintiff, especially given that the request hardly comes as a surprise \n2  ….”). Again, this factor supports granting Plaintiffs’ motion. \n3  E. The request has not been made in advance of the formal discovery \nprocess. \n4 \nThis action has been on file for over two years, extensive discovery on the merits \n5 \nhas taken place, and the Court has certified three separate classes under Rule 23. Because \n6 \nthe requested discovery is not premature as regards the initial discovery stay imposed by \n7 \nRule 26, this factor supports granting Plaintiffs motion.  \n8 \nCONCLUSION \n9 \nFor these reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court grant their request \n10 \nfor expedited discovery. \n11 \n \n12 \n \n13 \n   \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n7  \nMOTION FOR EXPEDITED DISCOVERY IN   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \nSUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n \n`   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 254   Filed 04/06/20   Page 8 of 11   Page ID #:5184\nDated:  April 6, 2020       Respectfully submitted, \n1 \n \n2   /s/ Daniel H.

GEO denies that this matter is suitable for class \n17\ncertification.  GEO affirmatively alleges that Plaintiff lacks standing to assert claims on \n18\nbehalf of other individuals, that Plaintiff lacks standing to seek declaratory and/or injunctive \n19\nrelief, and that Plaintiff is not a proper class representative. \n20\nAFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES \n21\nFIRST AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE \n22\nEach purported cause of action of Plaintiff’s FAC fails to allege facts sufficient to \n23\nconstitute a cause of action against GEO. \n24\nSECOND AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE \n25\nGEO has immunity from this lawsuit. \n26\n \n27\n \n28\nTHE GEO GROUP, INC.’S FIRST AMENDED ANSWER AND \nCOUNTERCLAIM TO PLAINTIFF’S FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n16 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 17 of 23   Page ID\n #:1025\n \n1\nTHIRD AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE \n2\nPlaintiff seeks relief barred by the statute of limitations. \n3\nFOURTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE \n4\nPlaintiff’s claim is pre-empted by federal law. \n5\nFIFTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE \n6\nPlaintiff has failed to join parties that should be joined under Federal Rule of Civil \n7\nProcedure 19. \n8\nSIXTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE \n9\nPlaintiff’s alleged injuries and damages, if any, were caused by the acts of a third \n10\nparty who has not been named a party to this action and over whom GEO had no control. \n11\nSEVENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE \n12\nPlaintiff’s requested relief violates the law, and is otherwise impossible to attain in \n13\nconformance with the law.  Neither Plaintiff nor putative class members have a legal right \n14\nto work at minimum wage rates because none has sought approval from the U.S. Attorney \n15\nGeneral for employment with GEO, and none are qualified to work for GEO under ICE’s \n16\ncontract terms and federal law.  Plaintiff’s participation in the Voluntary Work Program \n17\nwas voluntary. \n18\nEIGHTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE \n19\nPlaintiff lacks standing to brings the claims asserted in the FAC. \n20\nNINTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE \n21\nPlaintiff’s claim is not ripe. \n22\nTENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE \n23\nPlaintiff’s claim is not justiciable. \n24\nELEVENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE \n25\nPlaintiff has unclean hands. \n26\n \n27\n \n28\nTHE GEO GROUP, INC.’S FIRST AMENDED ANSWER AND \nCOUNTERCLAIM TO PLAINTIFF’S FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n17 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 18 of 23   Page ID\n #:1026\n \n1\nTWELFTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE \n2\nPlaintiff has unreasonably delayed his request for relief, to GEO’s prejudice, such \n3\nthat his claims are barred by the defense of laches. \n4\nTHIRTEENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE \n5\nPlaintiff is barred from seeking equitable relief to the extent an adequate remedy \n6\nexists at law. \n7\nFOURTEENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE \n8\nThe federal Trafficking Victims Protection Act is unconstitutionally vague and/or \n9\noverbroad as applied to GEO’s administration of the VWP. \n10\nFIFTEENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE \n11\nThe California Trafficking Victims Protection Act is unconstitutionally vague and/or \n12\noverbroad as applied to GEO’s administration of the VWP. \n13\nSIXTEENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE \n14\nCalifornia’s Minimum Wage Law, and IWC Wage Order are unconstitutionally \n15\nvague and/or overbroad as applied to GEO’s administration of the VWP. \n16\nSEVENTEENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE \n17\nGEO reserves the right to amend its Answer to Plaintiff’s FAC to assert additional \n18\ndefenses, withdraw defenses, and/or add counterclaims as may become necessary after \n19\nreasonable opportunity, or discovery has occurred, up through and including trial in this \n20\nmatter. \n21\nPRAYER \n22\nWHEREFORE, GEO respectfully requests: \n23\n1.  That Plaintiff take nothing by the FAC; \n24\n2.  A dismissal of the FAC with prejudice and an award of GEO’s reasonable \n25\nattorneys’ fees to the extent permitted by law; \n26\n3.

Costs of suit herein; and \n2\n5.  Such other and further relief, legal and equitable, that the Court may deem \n3\nproper. \n4\nCONDITIONAL AMENDED COUNTERCLAIM \n5\nCounter-Claimant  The  GEO  Group,  Inc.  (“GEO”),  through  counsel,  brings  the \n6\nfollowing conditional counterclaims against Counter-Defendant Raul Novoa (“Counter-\n7\nDefendant”), and against any putative class or classes certified by the Court. \n8\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n9\n1.  To the extent this Court holds that it has subject matter jurisdiction despite \n10\nGEO’s immunity, the Court will have jurisdiction over the parties and subject matter over \n11\nthis counterclaim.  GEO asserts its counterclaim only in the event that the Court has \n12\ndetermined it has subject matter jurisdiction.  GEO does not waive and expressly reserves \n13\nits objection to subject matter jurisdiction with respect to Plaintiff’s/Counter-Defendant’s \n14\nclaims.  To the extent GEO is subject to jurisdiction in this Court, jurisdiction over GEO’s \n15\ncounterclaim is grounded in diversity pursuant to 28 § U.S.C. 1332.  GEO is a Florida \n16\ncorporation with its principal place of business in Florida.  Raul Novoa is a citizen of \n17\nMexico, who alleges he is a resident of California.  The amount in controversy on the \n18\ncounterclaims exceeds $75,000.00. \n19\n2.  Alternatively,  this  Court  has  supplemental  jurisdiction  over  these \n20\ncounterclaims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a), as these counterclaims form part of the same \n21\ncase or controversy as the claims asserted by Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant under Article III \n22\nof the United States Constitution. \n23\n3.  Venue is proper in this Court, as the events giving rise to these counterclaims \n24\noccurred in this district. \n25\n \n26\n \n27\n \n28\nTHE GEO GROUP, INC.’S FIRST AMENDED ANSWER AND \nCOUNTERCLAIM TO PLAINTIFF’S FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n19 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 20 of 23   Page ID\n #:1028\n \n1\nPARTIES \n2\n  4.  GEO is a Florida corporation with its principal place of business in Florida.  \n3\nGEO is a service provider that operates the Adelanto Facility for the housing of federal \n4\nimmigration detainees in the custody of the federal government,  under terms set out in the \n5\ncontracts between the City of Adelanto and ICE, and the City of Adelanto and GEO, and \n6\napplicable regulations and detention facility standards, and the laws of the United States. \n7\n5.  Raul Novoa is a citizen of Mexico, who alleges he is a resident of California.  \n8\nCounter-Defendant was an ICE detainee at the Adelanto Facility at various times from 2012 \n9\nto 2015. \n10\n6.  While  detained  at  the  Adelanto  Facility,  Counter-Defendant  did  not  have \n11\nauthorization from the U.S. Attorney General to be employed in the United States under \n12\nfederal law. \n13\n7.  Because Counter-Defendant was in the custody of the federal government \n14\nwhile at the Adelanto Facility and participated in the Voluntary Work Program, California’s \n15\nMinimum Wage Law (“MWL”) does not apply to him. \n16\nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n17\nDeclaratory Relief—28 U.S.C. § 2201(a) \n18\n8.  GEO incorporates the allegations in Paragraphs 1-24, above, by reference as if \n19\nfully stated herein. \n20\n9.  At all times relevant to these proceedings, GEO administered a Voluntary \n21\nWork Program at the Adelanto Facility as required by the ICE contract.  That Voluntary \n22\nWork Program was, and is, subject to federal detention standards. \n23\n10.  The Voluntary Work Program at the Adelanto Facility is critical to the safe and \n24\nsecure operations of the facility.  Specifically, the Voluntary Work Program reduces idle \n25\ntime for detainees and promotes institutional efficiency, just as similar programs do in \n26\nCalifornia’s own facilities. \n27\n \n28\nTHE GEO GROUP, INC.’S FIRST AMENDED ANSWER AND \nCOUNTERCLAIM TO PLAINTIFF’S FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n20 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 21 of 23   Page ID\n #:1029\n \n1\n11.  Pursuant to an express authorization from Congress that ICE may authorize \n2\nallowances to immigration detainees for work performed while detained, ICE authorized an \n3\nallowance of $1.00 per day for each Voluntary Work Program participant. \n4\n12.  ICE must authorize any increase in the allowance rate of $1.00 per day, as \n5\nexpressed in the ICE contract for the Adelanto Facility.  Without an ICE-approved increase \n6\nin the allowance rate, detainees may not be given an allowance in excess of $1.00 per day \n7\nfor participation in the Voluntary Work Program at the Adelanto Facility. \n8\n13.  ICE also prohibits GEO from employing any detainees.  ICE must clear any \n9\nGEO employee working at the Adelanto Facility via a background check performed by ICE.  \n10\nICE also requires GEO to immediately suspend any employee found to have a history of \n11\narrests. \n12\n14.  Counter-Defendant and the putative class members were participants in the \n13\nVoluntary Work Program at the Adelanto Facility.  They were not authorized by ICE to \n14\nwork for GEO or anyone else in the United States, and did not complete the requirements \n15\nfor employment specified in the City’s detention services agreement with ICE.  Counter-\n16\nDefendant himself was ineligible for work because he was detained by ICE based on his \n17\ncriminal record in the United States, which includes possession of controlled substances, \n18\npossession of a firearm by a felon, giving a false ID to a peace officer, and domestic \n19\nviolence.  Counter-Defendant has not alleged that he, or any other Adelanto detainee, was \n20\ngranted work authorization by the Attorney General. \n21\n15.  Counter-Defendant  initiated  this  lawsuit,  claiming  California’s  labor  laws \n22\napply  to  him  and  the  putative  class  members,  when  they  do  not.    Because  Counter-\n23\nDefendant was in the custody of the federal government while at the Adelanto Facility and \n24\nparticipating in the Voluntary Work Program, California’s MWL does not apply to them.  \n25\nThis matter presents an actual controversy that can be finally resolved by the Court. \n26\n16.  GEO has already incurred attorneys’ fees and other costs defending against \n27\n \n28\nTHE GEO GROUP, INC.’S FIRST AMENDED ANSWER AND \nCOUNTERCLAIM TO PLAINTIFF’S FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n21 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 22 of 23   Page ID\n #:1030\n \n1\nPlaintiff/Counter-Defendant’s claims, and will continue to do so. \n2\n17.  ICE detainees at the Adelanto Facility, including Counter-Defendant and the \n3\nputative class members, are federal immigration detainees housed at the Adelanto Facility \n4\npursuant to the City’s detention services agreement with ICE.  They are not employed by \n5\nGEO, and are not employees of GEO.  The work performed by these detainees is performed \n6\nfor reasons other than compensation in order to provide for necessary food and shelter, as \n7\ndetainees participating in the Voluntary Work Program do not participate in commerce and \n8\ndo not depend on the wages they earn for basic necessities such as, for example, housing, \n9\nfood, clothing, and recreation, while detained. \n10\n18.  GEO therefore seeks a declaration that:  (1) no employment relationship exists \n11\nbetween GEO and detainees who participate in the Voluntary Work Program, including but \n12\nnot limited to Counter-Defendant and the putative class members; (2) such detainees, \n13\nincluding but not limited to Counter-Defendant and the putative class members, are not \n14\nemployees of GEO, and GEO is not their employer; (3) as a result, California’s labor laws \n15\nand wage orders do not apply to such detainees, including but not limited to Counter-\n16\nDefendant and the putative class members; and (4) Counter-Defendant and putative class \n17\nmembers are not entitled to disgorgement or other equitable relief for allegedly unpaid \n18\nwages or allegedly inequitable revenues or profits; (5) GEO has not violated the TVPA; (6) \n19\nGEO has not violated the California TVPA. \n20\nWHEREFORE, GEO prays for the following relief: \n21\n1.  An order enjoining Counter-Defendant and the putative class members from \n22\nclaiming California’s labor laws apply to them; \n23\n2.  An order declaring California’s labor laws do not apply to ICE detainees at the \n24\nAdelanto Facility, including but not limited to laws requiring payment of minimum wage \n25\nand overtime wages; \n26\n3.  An order declaring that there is no employment relationship between GEO and \n27\n \n28\nTHE GEO GROUP, INC.’S FIRST AMENDED ANSWER AND \nCOUNTERCLAIM TO PLAINTIFF’S FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n22 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 23 of 23   Page ID\n #:1031\n \n1\ndetainees housed at the Adelanto Facility who participate in the Volunteer Work Program, \n2\nspecifically that GEO is not the employer of such detainees, and that such detainees are not \n3\nemployees of GEO; \n4\n4.   An order declaring that GEO has not violated the TVPA or California TVPA.  \n5\n5.  An award of attorneys’ fees and costs; and \n6\n6.

GEO denies the remaining allegations set \n2  forth in Paragraph 5 of the Complaint. \n3  6.

To \n5  the extent this paragraph alleges any facts, GEO denies the allegations in Paragraph \n6  6 of the Complaint.  Voluntary Work Program participants choose to perform self-\n7  care  tasks  like  meal  preparation,  basic  housekeeping  chores,  and  grooming  to \n8  eliminate  idle  time  while  in  detention.    The  Voluntary  Work  Program  is \n9  administered  in  the  secured  environment  of  the  detention  facility,  pursuant  to \n10  federal detention standards.   \n11  7.

GEO specifically denies any violation of California’s Unfair Competition \n24  Law or the federal and state Trafficking Victims Protection Act. \n25  9.

Neither Plaintiff nor putative class members \n24  have  a  legal  right  to  work  at  minimum  wage  rates  because  none  has  sought \n25  approval from the U.S. Attorney General for employment with GEO, and none are \n26  qualified to work for GEO under ICE’s contract terms and federal law.

(“GEO”), through counsel, brings \n12  the  following  conditional  counterclaims  against  Counter-Defendant  Raul  Novoa \n13  (“Counter-Defendant”), and against any putative class or classes certified by the \n14  Court. \n15  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n16  1.  To the extent this Court holds that it has subject matter jurisdiction \n17  despite  GEO’s  immunity,  the  Court  will  have  jurisdiction  over  the  parties  and \n18  subject matter over this counterclaim.  GEO asserts its counterclaim only in the \n19  event that the Court has determined it has subject matter jurisdiction.  GEO does \n20  not waive and expressly reserves its objection to subject matter jurisdiction with \n21  respect to Plaintiff’s/Counter-Defendant’s claims. \n22  To the extent GEO is subject to jurisdiction in this Court, jurisdiction over \n23  GEO’s counterclaim is grounded in diversity pursuant to 28 § U.S.C. 1332.  GEO is \n24  a Florida corporation with its principal place of business in Florida.  Raul Novoa is \n25  a citizen of Mexico, who alleges he is a resident of California.  The amount in \n26  controversy on the counterclaims exceeds $75,000.00. \n27  2.  Alternatively,  this  Court  has  supplemental  jurisdiction  over  these \n28  counterclaims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a), as these counterclaims form part of \n \nDOCUMENT PREPARED  73142731.1  - 18 - 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHKx\nON RECYCLED PAPER \n  DEFENDANT THE GEO GROUP INC.’S ANSWER  TO PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT AND COUNTERCLAIMS \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 45   Filed 07/03/18   Page 19 of 27   Page ID #:349\n \n \n1  the same case or controversy as the claims asserted by Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant \n2  under Article III of the United States Constitution. \n3  3.  Venue  is  proper  in  this  Court,  as  the  events  giving  rise  to  these \n4  counterclaims occurred in this district. \n5  PARTIES \n6    4.  GEO is a Florida corporation with its principal place of business in \n7  Florida.  GEO is a service provider that operates the Adelanto Facility for the \n8  housing of federal immigration detainees in the custody of the federal government,  \n9  under terms set out in the contracts between the City of Adelanto and ICE, and \n10  applicable regulations and detention facility standards, and the laws of the United \n11  States. \n12  5.  Raul Novoa is a citizen of Mexico, who alleges he is a resident of \n13  California.  Counter-Defendant was an ICE detainee at the Adelanto Facility at \n14  various times from 2012 to 2015, during which time he received material benefits, \n15  including but not limited to housing, food, clothing, and recreation, at no cost to \n16  himself. \n17  6.  While detained at the Adelanto Facility, Counter-Defendant did not \n18  have authorization from the U.S. Attorney General to be employed in the United \n19  States under federal law. \n20  7.  Because  Counter-Defendant  was  in  the  custody  of  the  federal \n21  government while at the Adelanto Facility and participated in the Voluntary Work \n22  Program, California’s Minimum Wage Law (“MWL”) does not apply to him. \n23  FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n24  Unjust Enrichment/Offset \n25  8.  The City of Adelanto’s detention services contract with ICE requires \n26  all contractor and subcontractor personnel at the Adelanto Facility to meet high \n27  standards of professionalism and integrity, and sets specific requirements that must \n28  be met before an employee is permitted to enter duty at the facility, including \n \nDOCUMENT PREPARED  73142731.1  - 19 - 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHKx\nON RECYCLED PAPER \n  DEFENDANT THE GEO GROUP INC.’S ANSWER  TO PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT AND COUNTERCLAIMS \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 45   Filed 07/03/18   Page 20 of 27   Page ID #:350\n \n \n1  interviews,  criminal  history  and  other  background  checks,  and  employment \n2  eligibility verification.  Pursuant to the contract, ICE is the final approval authority \n3  for all contractor and subcontractor personnel who work with federal detainees at \n4  the Adelanto Facility under the terms of the agreement.  Proposed personnel with \n5  criminal convictions must be specifically approved by ICE; any such persons who \n6  are still under supervision or jurisdiction of any parole, probation, or correctional \n7  authority are prohibited from employment at the Adelanto Facility. \n8  9.  As  required  by  the  City’s  contract  with  ICE,  GEO  administers  the \n9  Voluntary Work Program at the Adelanto Facility, which is intended to offset the \n10  cost of detention to taxpayers and to reduce detainees’ idle time.  The Voluntary \n11  Work  Program  does  not,  and  is  not  intended  to,  create  an  employer/employee \n12  relationship between GEO and detainees housed at the Adelanto Facility. \n13  10.  Because the program is purely voluntary, detainees are not required to \n14  participate. \n15  11.  Participation  in  the  Voluntary  Work  Program  is  separate  from \n16  detainees’ responsibility to maintain their living areas in a neat and orderly manner, \n17  as required by ICE’s Performance-Based National Detention Standards and ICE’s \n18  detainee handbooks. \n19  12.  Because  the  Voluntary  Work  Program  is  intended  to  promote \n20  institutional  maintenance  and  reduce  detainee  idleness,  it  includes  none  of  the \n21  traditional performance metrics of a standard job.  Consequently, GEO does not \n22  perform  employment  intake,  background  checks,  or  any  of  the  normal  vetting \n23  processes that must be done before a new employee can be hired.  GEO does not \n24  require detainees to file the type of job applications that GEO’s employees must \n25  provide, or require detainees to prove their work eligibility as required by federal \n26  law.  Similarly, GEO does not evaluate or rate detainee performance, or discipline \n27  or fire detainees for poor performance.  GEO also lacks authority to determine what \n28  assignments  may  be  given  to  particular  detainees,  because  ICE  reserves  this \n \nDOCUMENT PREPARED  73142731.1  - 20 - 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHKx\nON RECYCLED PAPER \n  DEFENDANT THE GEO GROUP INC.’S ANSWER  TO PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT AND COUNTERCLAIMS \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 45   Filed 07/03/18   Page 21 of 27   Page ID #:351\n \n \n1  function through its risk classification process.  GEO performs none of the “hire” or \n2  “fire” roles of an employer, because ICE, not GEO, controls when detainees are \n3  brought to the Adelanto Facility, and when a detainee departs from the facility.   \n4  13.  Also, as required by the City’s contract with ICE, GEO provides basic \n5  necessities to all detainees housed at the Adelanto Facility, which include food, \n6  shelter, utilities, clothing, bedding, recreation, entertainment, or medical, dental, \n7  optical  or  mental  health  services.    Detainees  do  not  pay  GEO  or  the  federal \n8  government for these services, either in whole or in part. \n9  14.  Counter-Defendant  participated  in  the  Voluntary  Work  Program  at \n10  various  times  while  detained  at  the  Adelanto  Facility.    While  detained  at  the \n11  Adelanto Facility, Counter-Defendant did not have work authorization.  Further, \n12  Counter-Defendant himself was ineligible for work because he was detained by ICE \n13  based on his criminal record in the United States, which includes possession of \n14  controlled substances, possession of a firearm by a felon, giving a false ID to a \n15  peace officer, and domestic violence.  Counter-Defendant has not alleged that he, or \n16  any  other  Adelanto  detainee,  was  granted  work  authorization  by  the  Attorney \n17  General. \n18  15.  The putative class members, like Counter-Defendant, were detained by \n19  ICE,  housed  at  the  Adelanto  Facility,  and  participated  in  the  Voluntary  Work \n20  Program at various times relevant to these counterclaims. \n21  16.  GEO did not require or force Counter-Defendant or any other putative \n22  class members to participate in the Voluntary Work Program in any way. \n23  17.  Neither Counter-Defendant nor any of the putative class members filed \n24  formal  job  applications,  sat  for  pre-employment  interviews,  proved  their  work \n25  eligibility as required by federal law, competed against non-detainee applicants, or \n26  completed any of the other pre-employment requirements for GEO employees at \n27  the Adelanto Facility mandated by ICE’s contractual terms. \n28   \n \nDOCUMENT PREPARED  73142731.1  - 21 - 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHKx\nON RECYCLED PAPER \n  DEFENDANT THE GEO GROUP INC.’S ANSWER  TO PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT AND COUNTERCLAIMS \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 45   Filed 07/03/18   Page 22 of 27   Page ID #:352\n \n \n1  18.  Neither  Counter-Defendant  nor  any  of  the  putative  class  members \n2  participated in the Voluntary Work Program for more than eight hours per day or \n3  40  hours  per  week,  and  in  fact  often  volunteered  significantly  fewer  hours \n4  depending on their work assignment, some of which involved less than one hour \n5  per day.  Counter-Defendant’s and putative class members’ work performance and \n6  efficiency were not evaluated or tracked, and they were and are in no danger of \n7  being “fired” for underperformance. \n8  19.  The  participation  of  Counter-Defendant  and  the  putative  class \n9  members in the Voluntary Work Program was temporary and dependent upon their \n10  continued detention—they could not participate in the program after their detention \n11  ceased.  Moreover, Counter-Defendant and the putative class members were free to \n12  withdraw from the Voluntary Work Program at any time. \n13  20.  During their detention at the Adelanto Facility, Counter-Defendant—\n14  similar to all putative class members—understood and acknowledged the amount \n15  they  would  receive  for  participation.    Detainees  are  provided  with  a  National \n16  Detainee Handbook, issued to them by ICE, that specifically states that if they \n17  wanted to participate in the Voluntary Work Program, they could receive $1 per \n18  day for each day worked.  Counter-Defendant chose to participate in the Voluntary \n19  Work Program despite knowing he would receive no more than $1.00 per day \n20  regardless  of  his  level  of  participation,  and  signed  a  form  attesting  to  this \n21  understanding.  Detainees signed an agreement acknowledging “Compensation will \n22  be $1.00 per day.”  Counter-Defendant had, and could have had, no reasonable \n23  expectation  that  he  would  be  entitled  to  a  minimum  wage  for  the  tasks  he \n24  performed. \n25  21.  Counter-Defendant—similar  to  all  putative  class  members—paid \n26  neither GEO nor the federal government for the food, shelter, clothing, bedding, \n27  utilities,  recreation,  entertainment,  or  medical,  optical,  dental,  or  mental  health \n28  services  provided.    Unlike  a  person  outside  of  detention,  who  may  claim  a \n \nDOCUMENT PREPARED  73142731.1  - 22 - 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHKx\nON RECYCLED PAPER \n  DEFENDANT THE GEO GROUP INC.’S ANSWER  TO PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT AND COUNTERCLAIMS \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 45   Filed 07/03/18   Page 23 of 27   Page ID #:353\n \n \n1  minimum wage to enable him or her to afford these goods and services, Counter-\n2  Defendant  and  putative  class  members  received  the  benefit  of  these  goods  and \n3  services  from  GEO  without  charge  and  without  regard  for  participation  in  the \n4  Voluntary Work Program. \n5  22.  Counter-Defendant  and  any  putative  class  members  would  unjustly \n6  benefit from the receipt of wage payments under the MWL and California wage \n7  orders at rates in excess of $1.00 for participation in the Voluntary Work Program if \n8  Counter-Defendant, and any putative class members, were not required to offset \n9  such  payments  with  the  costs  and  expenses  associated  with  their  care  while \n10  detained.    GEO  incurred  costs  and  expenses  caring  for  Counter-Defendant  and \n11  other detainees in excess of $11.00 per hour for all goods and services provided to \n12  them.  By contrast, GEO’s actual employees—who were paid minimum wage or \n13  more—resided outside the Adelanto Facility and did not receive the goods and \n14  services provided at no cost to the Adelanto Facility-detainees. \n15  23.  The rate of payment for participation in the Voluntary Work Program \n16  is set by ICE under the contract, and cannot be modified without ICE’s approval.  \n17  The money for Voluntary Work Program participation is deposited in detainee trust \n18  accounts, and made available to detainees who participate.  Any requirement that \n19  GEO pay or advance money to detainees in excess of what was specified by the \n20  contracts, approved by ICE, and paid into detainee trust accounts unjustly enriches \n21  Counter-Defendant  and/or  putative  class  members.    Such  a  payment  would \n22  effectively  increase  GEO’s  burden  for  complying  with  its  current  contracts  by \n23  unilaterally  adding  an  entirely  new  service  to  that  contract:    employment  of \n24  detainees at California minimum wages, notwithstanding that, unlike non-detainee \n25  recipients of minimum wages, detainees’ living expenses are already being supplied \n26  to them for free. \n27  24.  In the event Counter-Defendant and/or any class members prevail on \n28  their theory that the MWL applies to detention programs like the Voluntary Work \n \nDOCUMENT PREPARED  73142731.1  - 23 - 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHKx\nON RECYCLED PAPER \n  DEFENDANT THE GEO GROUP INC.’S ANSWER  TO PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT AND COUNTERCLAIMS \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 45   Filed 07/03/18   Page 24 of 27   Page ID #:354\n \n \n1  Program at the Adelanto Facility, GEO is equitably entitled to recover its costs and \n2  expenses  associated  with  detaining  Counter-Defendant  and  the  putative  class \n3  members,  including  for  goods  and  services  associated  with  administering  the \n4  Voluntary Work Program with respect to Counter-Defendant and all putative class \n5  members. \n6  SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n7  Declaratory Relief—28 U.S.C. § 2201(a) \n8  25.  GEO  incorporates  the  allegations  in  Paragraphs  1-24,  above,  by \n9  reference as if fully stated herein. \n10  26.  At  all  times  relevant  to  these  proceedings,  GEO  administered  a \n11  Voluntary Work Program at the Adelanto Facility as required by the ICE contract.  \n12  That Voluntary Work Program was, and is, subject to federal detention standards. \n13  27.  The Voluntary Work Program at the Adelanto Facility is critical to the \n14  safe  and  secure  operations  of  the  facility.    Specifically,  the  Voluntary  Work \n15  Program reduces idle time for detainees and promotes institutional efficiency, just \n16  as similar programs do in California’s own facilities. \n17  28.  Pursuant  to  an  express  authorization  from  Congress  that  ICE  may \n18  authorize allowances to immigration detainees for work performed while detained, \n19  ICE authorized an allowance of $1.00 per day for each Voluntary Work Program \n20  participant. \n21  29.  ICE must authorize any increase in the allowance rate of $1.00 per \n22  day, as expressed in the ICE contract for the Adelanto Facility.  Without an ICE-\n23  approved increase in the allowance rate, detainees may not be given an allowance \n24  in excess of $1.00 per day for participation in the Voluntary Work Program at the \n25  Adelanto Facility. \n26  30.  ICE also prohibits GEO from employing any detainees.  ICE must \n27  clear any GEO employee working at the Adelanto Facility via a background check \n28    \n \nDOCUMENT PREPARED  73142731.1  - 24 - 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHKx\nON RECYCLED PAPER \n  DEFENDANT THE GEO GROUP INC.’S ANSWER  TO PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT AND COUNTERCLAIMS \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 45   Filed 07/03/18   Page 25 of 27   Page ID #:355\n \n \n1  performed by ICE.  ICE also requires GEO to immediately suspend any employee \n2  found to have a history of arrests. \n3  31.  Counter-Defendant and the putative class members were participants \n4  in the Voluntary Work Program at the Adelanto Facility.  They were not authorized \n5  by ICE to work for GEO or anyone else in the United States, and did not complete \n6  the  requirements  for  employment  specified  in  the  City’s  detention  services \n7  agreement with ICE.  Counter-Defendant himself was ineligible for work because \n8  he was detained by ICE based on his criminal record in the United States, which \n9  includes possession of controlled substances, possession of a firearm by a felon, \n10  giving a false ID to a peace officer, and domestic violence.  Counter-Defendant has \n11  not alleged that he, or any other Adelanto detainee, was granted work authorization \n12  by the Attorney General. \n13  32.  Counter-Defendant initiated this lawsuit, claiming California’s labor \n14  laws apply to him and the putative class members, when they do not.  Because \n15  Counter-Defendant  was  in  the  custody  of  the  federal  government  while  at  the \n16  Adelanto Facility and participating in the Voluntary Work Program, California’s \n17  MWL does not apply to them.  This matter presents an actual controversy that can \n18  be finally resolved by the Court. \n19  33.  GEO has already incurred attorneys’ fees and other costs defending \n20  against Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant’s claims, and will continue to do so. \n21  34.  ICE detainees at the Adelanto Facility, including Counter-Defendant \n22  and the putative class members, are federal immigration detainees housed at the \n23  Adelanto Facility pursuant to the City’s detention services agreement with ICE.  \n24  They  are  not  employed  by  GEO,  and  are  not  employees  of  GEO.    The  work \n25  performed by these detainees is performed for reasons other than compensation in \n26  order to provide for necessary food and shelter, as detainees participating in the \n27  Voluntary Work Program do not participate in commerce and do not depend on the \n28  wages they earn for basic necessities such as, for example, housing, food, clothing, \n \nDOCUMENT PREPARED  73142731.1  - 25 - 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHKx\nON RECYCLED PAPER \n  DEFENDANT THE GEO GROUP INC.’S ANSWER  TO PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT AND COUNTERCLAIMS \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 45   Filed 07/03/18   Page 26 of 27   Page ID #:356\n \n \n1  and recreation, while detained, as those necessities are provided to them at taxpayer \n2  expense. \n3  35.  GEO  therefore  seeks  a  declaration  that:    (1)  no  employment \n4  relationship exists between GEO and detainees who participate in the Voluntary \n5  Work Program, including but not limited to Counter-Defendant and the putative \n6  class members; (2) such detainees, including but not limited to Counter-Defendant \n7  and the putative class members, are not employees of GEO, and GEO is not their \n8  employer; (3) as a result, California’s labor laws and wage orders do not apply to \n9  such detainees, including but not limited to Counter-Defendant and the putative \n10  class  members;  and  (4)  Counter-Defendant  and  putative  class  members  are  not \n11  entitled to disgorgement or other equitable relief for allegedly unpaid wages or \n12  allegedly inequitable revenues or profits. \n13  WHEREFORE, GEO prays for the following relief: \n14  1.  An order enjoining Counter-Defendant and the putative class members \n15  from claiming California’s labor laws apply to them; \n16  2.  An  order  declaring  California’s  labor  laws  do  not  apply  to  ICE \n17  detainees  at  the  Adelanto  Facility,  including  but  not  limited  to  laws  requiring \n18  payment of minimum wage and overtime wages; \n19  3.  An order declaring that there is no employment relationship between \n20  GEO and detainees housed at the Adelanto Facility who participate in the Volunteer \n21  Work Program, specifically that GEO is not the employer of such detainees, and \n22  that such detainees are not employees of GEO; \n23  4.  In the event Counter-Defendant and the putative class members prevail \n24  on  their  theory  that  California  labor  laws,  including  but  not  limited  to  laws \n25  regarding minimum wages, apply to detention facility work programs, including the \n26  Voluntary Work Program at the Adelanto Facility, an order awarding GEO all costs \n27  and expenses for goods and services that unjustly enriched Counter-Defendant and \n28  the putative class members, including but not limited to housing, food, clothing, \n \nDOCUMENT PREPARED  73142731.1  - 26 - 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHKx\nON RECYCLED PAPER \n  DEFENDANT THE GEO GROUP INC.’S ANSWER  TO PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT AND COUNTERCLAIMS \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 45   Filed 07/03/18   Page 27 of 27   Page ID #:357\n \n \n1  and recreation and health services; and all wages that unjustly enriched detainees in \n2  excess of the $1.00 daily rate paid to them.  \n3  5.

(“GEO”).  \n4 \n5  2.  Adelanto is a civil immigration detention center owned and operated for \n6 \nprofit by GEO. \n7 \n3.  GEO is a multibillion-dollar corporation that owns and operates detention \n8 \nfacilities around the world, including at least fourteen civil immigration detention centers \n9 \n10 \nin the United States. GEO has made billions in revenue from its contracts with United \n11 \nStates Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) to operate these facilities.   \n12 \n4.  Although it is contractually required to provide for all essential detention \n13 \n14  services at Adelanto, GEO uses free or nearly-free labor of civilly detained immigrants \n15 \nto perform those services in order to maximize profits. \n16 \n5.  GEO pays detained immigrants just $1 per day, or nothing at all, to \n17 \n18  maintain and operate Adelanto.        \n19 \n6.  This labor is not voluntary in any meaningful sense. GEO maintains a \n20 \ncorporate policy and uniform practice at Adelanto of withholding necessary care from \n21 \n22  its detainees to ensure a ready supply of available labor needed to operate the Facility. \n23 \nAs a result, detainees are forced to submit to GEO’s $1 per day scheme in order to buy \n24 \nthe basic necessities – including food, water, and hygiene products – that GEO refuses \n25 \n26  to provide for them.    \n \n  2  \nPLAINTIFFS’ THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \n   \n     \n \n \n\nCase  5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 184   Filed 09/16/19   Page 3 of 59   Page ID #:1910\n \n \n1  7.  In  at  least  fourteen  of  its  immigration  detention  centers  nationwide, \n2 \nincluding Adelanto, GEO requires detained immigrants to perform uncompensated \n3 \njanitorial and maintenance work under threat of solitary confinement and criminal \n4 \n5  prosecution. This uncompensated labor is neither required nor permitted by ICE’s \n6 \nPerformance-Based National Detention Standards (“PBNDS”) or GEO’s contracts \n7 \nwith ICE. \n8 \n8.  GEO  maintains  a  corporate  policy  and  uniform  practice  at  its  civil \n9 \n10 \nimmigration detention centers, including Adelanto, of threatening detainees who refuse \n11 \nto work with disciplinary segregation or solitary confinement, reporting their actions to \n12 \nICE, or referring them for criminal prosecution. These abusive practices and threats of \n13 \n14  serious harm ensure that detained immigrants will continue working for subminimum \n15 \nwages or nothing at all, thus unlawfully enhancing GEO’s profit margins. \n16 \n9.  Pursuant to GEO’s policies and practices at nearly every civil immigration \n17 \n18  detention facility the company operates, detained immigrants face an impossible choice: \n19 \neither perform uncompensated labor under threat of serious harm, or “volunteer” to \n20 \nwork for GEO for between $1 and $4 per day.  \n21 \n22  10.  GEO significantly reduces its labor costs and expenses, and increases its \n23 \nalready vast profits, by unlawfully forcing and coercing detained immigrants to perform \n24 \nlabor at subminimum wages.  These policies and practices violate California minimum \n25 \n26  wage law, the California Unfair Competition Law, the California common law of unjust \n \n  3  \nPLAINTIFFS’ THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \n   \n     \n \n \n\nCase  5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 184   Filed 09/16/19   Page 4 of 59   Page ID #:1911\n \n \n1  enrichment, and the California and federal Trafficking Victims Protection Acts, which \n2 \nprohibit forced labor.  \n3 \n11.   Plaintiffs  Raul  Novoa,  Jaime  Campos  Fuentes,  Abdiaziz  Karim,  and \n4 \n5  Ramon Mancia, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, bring this class \n6 \naction lawsuit to stop the economic exploitation of detained immigrants in GEO’s care, \n7 \nto recover unpaid wages, and to remedy the unjust enrichment resulting from GEO’s \n8 \nunlawful failure to pay its detainee workforce legal wages.         \n9 \n10 \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n11 \n12.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 \n12 \nbecause this action arises under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, 18 U.S.C. \n13 \n14  §§ 1589 et seq. \n15 \n13.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the Class Action \n16 \nFairness Act of 2005, 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d), because at least one class member is of diverse \n17 \n18  citizenship from one defendant; there are more than 100 class members; the aggregate \n19 \namount in controversy exceeds $5,000,000; and minimal diversity exists. \n20 \n14.  Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) because the \n21 \n22  events or omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in this District. \n23 \n15.  This Court has personal jurisdiction over GEO because the corporation \n24 \nregularly conducts business in California and has sufficient minimum contacts with \n25 \n26  California.    \n \n  4  \nPLAINTIFFS’ THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \n   \n     \n \n \n\nCase  5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 184   Filed 09/16/19   Page 5 of 59   Page ID #:1912\n \n \n1  16.

Immigration detention is civil—not criminal.  \n3 \n22.  Each  year,  hundreds  of  thousands  of  individuals  are  detained  in \n4 \n5  geographically isolated immigration detention facilities while awaiting immigration or \n6 \ncitizenship  status  determinations.  These  detainees  include  U.S.  citizens,  lawful \n7 \npermanent residents (green card holders) with longstanding family and community ties, \n8 \nsurvivors of torture, asylum seekers, victims of human trafficking, children, and pregnant \n9 \n10 \nwomen.  \n11 \n23.  Some detainees, like Mr. Novoa and Mr. Mancia, were brought to the \n12 \nUnited States as children. And thousands ultimately have their United States citizenship \n13 \n14  or legal residency affirmed by an immigration court or federal judge. \n15 \n24.  Immigration violations are civil violations, and immigration detention is \n16 \ncivil in nature.1 Many detainees have no criminal history at all.   \n17 \n18  25.  Notwithstanding  immigration  detention’s  civil  nature  and  purpose, \n19 \ndetainees are often subjected to prison-like conditions. According to Dora Schriro, \n20 \nformer head of ICE’s Office of Detention Policy and Planning, most detainees are held \n21 \n22  – systematically and unnecessarily – under circumstances inappropriate for immigration \n23 \n24 \n \n25 \n1 See Fong Yue Ting v. United States, 149 U.S. 698, 728–30 (1893) (observing that deportation \nproceedings have “all the elements of a civil case” and are “in no proper sense a trial or sentence \n26 \nfor a crime or offense”). \n   \n  7  \nPLAINTIFFS’ THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \n   \n     \n \n \n\nCase  5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 184   Filed 09/16/19   Page 8 of 59   Page ID #:1915\n \n \n1  detention’s noncriminal purposes.2  Detained immigrants are frequently subjected to \n2 \npunitive  and  long-term  solitary  confinement,  inadequate  medical  care,  sexual  and \n3 \nphysical assault, and other harsh conditions of confinement.3 \n4 \n5  26.  Many detained immigrants submit to deportation simply to obtain release \n6 \nfrom these intolerable conditions, even when they have valid claims to remain in the \n7 \nUnited States, including claims to asylum or other discretionary relief.      \n8 \nB.  The privatization of immigration detention and GEO’s economic windfall. \n9 \n10  27.  Immigration  detention  expanded  roughly  eightfold  over  the  past  two \n11 \ndecades, from a capacity of 5,532 detention beds in 19944 to a current capacity of over \n12 \n41,000.5  \n13 \n14  28.

As  immigration  detention  has  expanded,  private  prison  corporations, \n2 \nparticularly GEO, have gained an increasing share of the contracts for new detention \n3 \nbeds.7  \n4 \n5  30.  Contracts with ICE accounted for 23.1% of GEO’s revenues in 2016, up \n6 \nfrom 17.7% in 2015.8 GEO officials expect these lucrative ICE contracts to account for \n7 \na significant percentage of the corporation’s ongoing revenues.9  \n8 \n31.  GEO’s revenues in 2016, 2017, and 2018 were over $2 billion, and its stock \n9 \n10 \nis publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange.   \n11 \n32.  GEO’s  economic  windfall,  and  the  profitability  of  its  immigration \n12 \ndetention enterprise, arises from its policy of systemically withholding necessary case \n13 \n14  from detainees to ensure a readily available, captive labor force that cleans, maintains, \n15 \nand operates its facilities for sub-minimal wages under threat of serious harm and abuse \n16 \nof legal process. Without this nearly free detainee labor, GEO’s windfall from immigrant \n17 \n18  detention would be substantially decreased.  \n19 \n33.  As  a  result  of  its  REIT  structure  and  increasing  moves  by  lending \n20 \ninstitutions away from extending credit to the private prison industry, GEO depends on \n21 \n22  the free and nearly free labor of detained immigrants to meet its projected revenues. \n23 \n \n24 \n7 Bethany Carson & Eleana Diaz, Payoff: How Congress Ensures Private Prison Profit with an \nImmigrant Detention Quota, Grassroots Leadership (Apr. 2015) at 4, Chart 1-AA, available at \n25 \nhttps://grassrootsleadership.org/sites/default/files/reports/quota_report_final_digital.pdf  \n8 The GEO Group, Inc., 2017 10-K form at 36, available at \n26 \nhttp://www.snl.com/Cache/c38242453.html.   \n  9 Id. \n  9  \nPLAINTIFFS’ THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \n   \n     \n \n \n\nC ase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 184   Filed 09/16/19   Page 10 of 59   Page ID\n #:1917\n \n \n1  C.  GEO withholds necessary care from detainees at the Adelanto Facility.  \n2 \n34.  Since 2011, GEO has contracted with ICE to operate the Adelanto Facility, \n3 \nwhich is a 1,940-bed immigration detention facility in Adelanto, California. More than \n4 \n5  73,000 people have passed through the Facility.   \n6 \n35.  Adelanto is notorious for its poor treatment of detainees. \n7 \n36.  For example, in November 2011, shortly after Adelanto opened, an ICE \n8 \nannual review found that the Facility’s “medical officials were not conducting detainee \n9 \n10 \nhealth appraisals within 14 days of arrival, and registered nurses were performing health \n11 \nassessments” without proper training or certification.10 \n12 \n37.  Ten  months  later,  ICE’s  Office  of  Detention  Oversight  found  that \n13 \n14  Adelanto officials often delay responding to detainee requests for medical care and fail \n15 \nto promptly review medical records.11 That report also said that the death of a detainee \n16 \nin March 2012 resulted from “egregious errors” by medical staff and could have been \n17 \n18  prevented. \n19 \n38.  In 2014, the Office of Detention Oversight found Adelanto deficient in 26 \n20 \ncompetency areas, including 16 related to the Facility’s efforts to prevent and intervene \n21 \n22  in sexual abuse.12  \n23 \n \n24 \n10 https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/odo-compliance-\ninspections/adelantoCorrectionalFac_Adelanto-CA-Sept_18-20-2012.pdf  \n25 \n11 Id.  \n12 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Office of Professional Responsibility, Office of \n26 \nOversight Detention, “Compliance Inspection,” (July 2014), available at \n  https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/odo-compliance-inspections/2014AdelantoJuly.pdf  \n  1 0 \nPLAINTIFFS’ THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \n   \n     \n \n \n\nC ase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 184   Filed 09/16/19   Page 11 of 59   Page ID\n #:1918\n \n \n1  39.  In 2015, more than two dozen members of Congress wrote a letter to \n2 \nthe U.S. Justice Department and ICE officials expressing concerns about reports of \n3 \nmedical neglect at the Facility.13 That same year, 26 detainees resorted to a two-week \n4 \n5  hunger strike to protest GEO’s failure to provide adequate care there.14    \n6 \n40.  The Adelanto Facility was called “the deadliest detention center of 2017” \n7 \nby immigrant rights activists because more detainees died there than in any other \n8 \ndetention center in the United States that year.15  \n9 \n10  41.  A  peer-reviewed  study  released  in  2017  found  that  detainees  held  six \n11 \nmonths or more at Adelanto experienced lower likelihoods of receiving any in-person \n12 \nvisitation with their children, as well as fewer total visits.16 \n13 \n14  42.  In  2018,  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  Office  of  Inspector \n15 \nGeneral (“OIG”) conducted an unannounced visit of the Adelanto Facility and found \n16 \nnooses made of braided bedsheets hanging from vents in 15 of the 20 cells they \n17 \n18 \n19   \n13 Kate Linthicum, “Citing neglect, lawmakers urge halt to migrant detention center expansion,” Los \n20 \nAngeles Times (July 14, 2015), available at  http://beta.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-adelanto-\nimmigrant-detention-20150713-story.html  \n21 \n14 Kate Linthicum, “Immigrants end hunger strike at Adelanto detention facility,” Los Angeles Times \n22  (Nov. 16, 2015), available at http://beta.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-adelanto-hunger-strike-\nends-20151116-story.html  \n23  15 Detention Watch Network, “Third Death in Immigration Detention Makes the Adelanto \nDetention Center the Deadliest Facility in 2017,” (June 2, 2017), available at \n24 \nhttps://www.detentionwatchnetwork.org/pressroom/releases/2017/third-death-immigration-\ndetention-makes-adelanto-detention-center-deadliest  \n25 \n16 Caitlin Patler and Nicolas Branic, “Patterns of Family Visitation During Immigration Detention,” \nRSF: The Russell Sage Foundation Journal of the Social Sciences, vol. 3 no. 4 18-36 (July 2017) \n26 \navailable at https://www.rsfjournal.org/content/3/4/18.  \n   \n  1 1 \nPLAINTIFFS’ THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \n   \n     \n \n \n\nC ase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 184   Filed 09/16/19   Page 12 of 59   Page ID\n #:1919\n \n \n1  inspected.17 OIG also reported that detainees were inappropriately segregated from \n2 \nothers without a disciplinary hearing and that that detainees did not have access to \n3 \nmedical or dental care in a timely fashion, which OIG concluded was responsible for \n4 \n5  three deaths since 2015.   \n6 \n43.  Despite this track record, GEO maintains a corporate policy and uniform \n7 \npractice  of  withholding  sufficient  food,  water,  and  hygiene  products  from  the \n8 \nimmigrants detained at Adelanto. As a result, detained immigrants are forced to either \n9 \n10 \npurchase these daily necessities from the Facility’s commissary or go without.  \n11 \n44.  By maintaining these harsh conditions and purposely withholding basic \n12 \nnecessities from detainees, GEO ensures an available labor pool of detained immigrants \n13 \n14  will work for only $1 per day, thus allowing it to continue operating the Adelanto Facility \n15 \nat an enormous profit.  \n16 \nD.  GEO  uses  detained  immigrants  to  clean,  maintain,  and  operate  the \n17 \nAdelanto Facility. \n18   \n45.  Through its so-called Voluntary Work Program (the “Work Program”), \n19 \n20  GEO  hires  detainees  at  Adelanto  to  perform  work  that  directly  contributes  to \n21 \ninstitutional operations, at a rate of $1 per day. \n22 \n46.  GEO pays detainees participating in the Work Program more than $1 per \n23 \n24  day for their labor at some of the company’s other civil immigration detention centers. \n25 \n \n17 Department of Homeland Security, Office of Inspector General, “Management Alert – Issues \n26 \nRequiring Action at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in Adelanto, California,” (Sept. 7, 2019) \n  available at https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/Mga/2018/oig-18-86-sep18.pdf \n  1 2 \nPLAINTIFFS’ THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \n   \n     \n \n \n\nC ase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 184   Filed 09/16/19   Page 13 of 59   Page ID\n #:1920\n \n \n1  47.  Despite its name, the Work Program is not “voluntary.” Instead, GEO \n2 \nmaintains a corporate policy and uniform practice at the Adelanto Facility of withholding \n3 \nnecessary care from its detained immigrants. As a result, detained immigrants are forced \n4 \n5  to submit to GEO’s $1 per day scheme in order to buy necessities – including food, \n6 \nwater, and hygiene products – that GEO refuses to provide for them.   \n7 \n48.  GEO also operates an “Uncompensated Work Program” at Adelanto. \n8 \nUnder  the  Uncompensated  Work  Program,  detained  immigrants  complete  a  job \n9 \n10 \napplication for a position in the Work Program, but must work for an arbitrary period \n11 \nof time – months, in some cases – for no compensation before they are officially hired \n12 \ninto the Work Program and begin to receive $1 per day for their labor.  \n13 \n14  49.  The Uncompensated Work Program is distinct from the Work Program \n15 \nbecause GEO does not pay detained immigrants in the Uncompensated Work Program \n16 \nfor their labor. \n17 \n18  50.  In  both  the  Work  Program  and  the  Uncompensated  Work  Program, \n19 \ndetained immigrants are required to work according to an assigned work schedule and \n20 \nto participate in work-related training. At all times, GEO controls workers’ wages, hours, \n21 \n22  and working conditions.   \n23 \n51.  In both the Work Program and the Uncompensated Work Program, GEO \n24 \nprovides all necessary personal protection equipment and work uniforms. For example, \n25 \n26  kitchen workers are provided with and required to wear a white top/bottom uniform \n \n  1 3 \nPLAINTIFFS’ THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \n   \n     \n \n \n\nC ase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 184   Filed 09/16/19   Page 14 of 59   Page ID\n #:1921\n \n \n1  with a white apron, rubberized work boots, beard guards and hairnets, and freezer \n2 \njackets and gloves as needed.  \n3 \n52.  In both the Work Program and the Uncompensated Work Program, GEO \n4 \n5  tracks the hours detained immigrants work. \n6 \n53.  In the Work Program only, GEO periodically credits wages to detainee \n7 \nworkers’ commissary accounts.         \n8 \n54.  GEO refers to detainee workers participating in both the Work Program \n9 \n10 \nand the Uncompensated Work Program as “employees.”  \n11 \n55.  Detainee  workers  participating  in  both  the  Work  Program  and  the \n12 \nUncompensated Work Program are “employees” under California’s minimum wage \n13 \n14  laws. \n15 \n56.  GEO is an “employer” under California’s minimum wage laws. \n16 \n57.

The Work Program and the Uncompensated Work Program allow GEO \n2 \nto avoid recruiting from the traditional labor market, complying with the terms of its \n3 \nunion contracts, and paying all costs associated with potential, current, and former \n4 \n5  employment relationships, thereby reducing operational costs and increasing its own \n6 \nprofits. \n7 \n60.  GEO maintains the ability to hire and fire detained immigrant workers in \n8 \nboth the Work Program and the Uncompensated Work Program. \n9 \n10  61.  GEO does not pay and has not paid detained immigrant workers the state \n11 \nminimum wage – currently, $12 per hour – for the hours they worked at Adelanto. \n12 \n62.  GEO’s contract with ICE requires GEO to comply with all federal, state, \n13 \n14  and local laws.  \n15 \n63.  No  clause  in  GEO’s  contract  with  ICE  or  any  rule  or  standard \n16 \nincorporated by reference into the contract requires GEO to maximize its profits by \n17 \n18  paying detainees subminimum wages or nothing at all.  \n19 \n64.  GEO maintains a corporate policy and uniform practice at Adelanto of \n20 \nthreatening to place detainees who refuse to work into solitary confinement. These \n21 \n22  conditions,  policies,  and  practices  ensure  that  detainees  continue  working  for \n23 \nsubminimum wages.       \n24 \n65.

GEO  secures  free  detainee  labor  at  nearly  all  of  its  civil  immigration \ndetention centers nationwide through systematic threats of serious harm. \n2 \n \n3  66.  GEO  owns  or  operates  at  least  fourteen  civil  immigration  detention \n4 \ncenters nationwide, including Adelanto, under contracts with ICE.  \n5 \n67.  At  each  facility,  GEO  is  contractually  required  to  comply  with  some \n6 \nversion of ICE’s 2011 PBNDS.  \n7 \n8 \n68.  GEO’s contracts with ICE to operate civil immigration detention facilities, \n9 \nincluding Adelanto, incorporate the PBNDS.  \n10 \n69.  All applicable versions of the PBNDS require any labor performed by a \n11 \n12  detained immigrant to be voluntary: “Work assignments are voluntary; however all \n13 \ndetainees are responsible for personal housekeeping.” PBNDS § 5.8.V.C. \n14 \n70.

Outside of the four personal housekeeping tasks enumerated in PBNDS  \n2 \n§ 5.8.V.C, GEO cannot force or compel civil immigration detainees to work.   \n3 \n72.  However, in violation of the PBNDS, its contracts with ICE, and the \n4 \n5  California and federal forced labor statutes, GEO promulgates and enforces corporate \n6 \npolicies known as Housing Unit Sanitation Policies (“HUSPs”) at nearly all of its civil \n7 \nimmigration detention facilities, including Adelanto.  \n8 \n73.  GEO’s HUSPs require detained immigrants to perform a wide range of \n9 \n10 \ncompletely uncompensated work for the company’s enrichment. \n11 \n74.  Under  the  HUSPs,  detained  immigrants  are  forced  to  perform \n12 \nuncompensated labor, such as cleaning and maintaining areas of its facilities that are \n13 \n14  outside the scope of the Personal Housekeeping Requirement, PBNDS § 5.8.V.C. For \n15 \ninstance, the HUSPs require detained immigrants to clean and sanitize walls, bathrooms, \n16 \nshowers, toilets, microwaves, furniture, windows and floors—work well outside the four \n17 \n18  personal housekeeping tasks enumerated in PBNDS  § 5.8.V.C. \n \n19 \n75.  Detained immigrants do not perform labor under the HUSPs as part of the \n20 \nICE-sanctioned Work Program. \n21 \n22  76.  Detained immigrants are not paid to perform labor under the HUSPs. \n23 \n77.  The work required by the HUSPs is outside the scope of the four specified \n24 \npersonal housekeeping tasks articulated by ICE in PBNDS § 5.8.V.C. \n25 \n26 \n \n  1 8 \nPLAINTIFFS’ THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \n   \n     \n \n \n\nC ase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 184   Filed 09/16/19   Page 19 of 59   Page ID\n #:1926\n \n \n1  78.  At Adelanto and nationwide, GEO obtains compliance with its HUSPs by \n2 \ndetained immigrants with serious harm, including actual or threated physical restraint, \n3 \nphysical assault such as pepper spray or use of force, deprivation of legally required \n4 \n5  services such as recreation, law library, and telephone time; solitary confinement, and \n6 \nabuse of legal process, including reporting misbehavior to ICE or to the immigration \n7 \ncourt, and even criminal prosecution. \n8 \n79.  The Detainee Handbooks provided to each detained immigrant during \n9 \n10 \nintake at GEO’s facilities across the country classifies “[r]efusal to clean assigned living \n11 \narea” as a 300-level “High Moderate” offense punishable by, inter alia, up to 72 hours in \n12 \ndisciplinary  restriction  (also  known  as  solitary  confinement)  or  even  criminal \n13 \n14  prosecution.  \n15 \n80.  The  Detainee  Handbooks  also  threaten  solitary  confinement  for \n16 \ndisobeying guards and refusing to comply with corporate facility policies.  \n17 \n18  81.  Detained immigrants thus have no meaningful choice but to comply with \n19 \na demand from a GEO official to perform free labor.  \n20 \n82.  The HUSPs are GEO-created corporate policies.  \n21 \n22  83.  Detained immigrants at nearly all GEO immigration detention centers are \n23 \nnotified when they enter the facility of GEO’s requirement that they must perform \n24 \nuncompensated,  non-personal  cleaning  and  maintenance  work,  and  that  the \n25 \n26  consequence of refusal can be disciplinary action, including solitary confinement.     \n \n  1 9 \nPLAINTIFFS’ THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \n   \n     \n \n \n\nC ase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 184   Filed 09/16/19   Page 20 of 59   Page ID\n #:1927\n \n \n1  84.  In addition to the text of the HUSPs themselves, GEO employs a false \n2 \nbinary  of  so-called  “Rights  and  Responsibilities”  in  its  corporate,  facility-specific \n3 \nDetainee  Handbooks  in  which  GEO  informs  detained  immigrants  in  English  and \n4 \n5  Spanish (but no other languages) that they have a “right” to participate in a work \n6 \nprogram as far as resources are available, but also a corresponding “responsibility” to \n7 \ntake advantage of activities which may help them live a successful and law-abiding life \n8 \nwithin the facility and in the community” and to abide by the regulations governing these \n9 \n10 \nprograms. \n11 \n85.  Taken together with the HUSPs, GEO’s facility-specific local Detainee \n12 \nHandbooks are intended to leave detained immigrants with the false impression that the \n13 \n14  company can compel them to perform work outside the four personal housekeeping \n15 \ntasks set forth in Section 5.8.V.C of the PBNDS. \n16 \n86.  No  clause  in  GEO’s  contracts  with  ICE  or  any  rule  or  standard \n17 \n18  incorporated by reference therein permits GEO to compel or force detainees to work \n19 \nfor free at Adelanto or any other GEO civil immigration detention facility. \n20 \n87.  GEO’s contracts with ICE incorporating the PBNDS expressly prohibit \n21 \n22  the  company  from  forcing,  coercing,  or  mandating  detainees  to  complete  work \n23 \nassignments that fall outside the scope of the personal housekeeping requirement, \n24 \nPBNDS § 5.8.V.C. \n25 \n26 \n \n  2 0 \nPLAINTIFFS’ THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \n   \n     \n \n \n\nC ase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 184   Filed 09/16/19   Page 21 of 59   Page ID\n #:1928\n \n \n1  88.  As a federal contractor, GEO is also prohibited by Executive Order, the \n2 \nFederal Acquisition Regulations, and Homeland Security Acquisition Regulations from \n3 \nusing forced labor in the performance of its contracts with ICE.  \n4 \n5  89.  GEO must promptly report allegations of forced labor made against the \n6 \ncorporation  to  the  federal  government,  regardless  of  whether  it  contests  those \n7 \nallegations.  \n8 \n90.

By  carrying  out  a  scheme  requiring  detained  immigrants  to  perform \n13 \n14  uncompensated janitorial and maintenance work pursuant to corporate HUSPs and \n15 \nunder threat of serious harm, GEO violates the federal forced labor statute. 18 U.S.C. \n16 \n§ 1589. \n17 \n18  F.  Plaintiff Raul Novoa’s individual allegations. \n19 \n92.  Mr. Novoa is citizen of Mexico and a legal permanent resident of the \n20 \nUnited States. He has lived in Los Angeles since age four.   \n21 \n22  93.  Mr.  Novoa  is  employed  by  a  commercial  construction  company  to \n23 \ncomplete roofing, tiling, drywalling, and framing projects. He currently earns more than \n24 \n$15 per hour.  \n25 \n26 \n \n  2 1 \nPLAINTIFFS’ THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \n   \n     \n \n \n\nC ase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 184   Filed 09/16/19   Page 22 of 59   Page ID\n #:1929\n \n \n1  94.  Mr. Novoa was detained at the Adelanto Facility from June 2012 through \n2 \nFebruary 2015. \n3 \n95.  Mr. Novoa performed work for GEO at the Adelanto Facility and was not \n4 \n5  paid the state minimum wage for that work. \n6 \n96.  As a janitor, Mr. Novoa worked in a five-person crew to clean windows, \n7 \nfloors, showers, bathrooms, and communal areas in the Facility. He worked four-hour \n8 \nshifts, up to seven days per week. He used cleaning supplies and equipment provided by \n9 \n10 \nGEO. \n11 \n97.  As a barber, Mr. Novoa provided haircutting services to other detained \n12 \nimmigrants. He worked up to 10 hours per day, seven days per week. He used barber \n13 \n14  supplies and equipment provided by GEO.  \n15 \n98.  In return for this labor, GEO paid Mr. Novoa $1 per day, regardless of the \n16 \nnumber of hours he worked. GEO credited these wages to Mr. Novoa’s commissary \n17 \n18  account.  \n19 \n99.  GEO withheld daily necessities from Mr. Novoa, thereby forcing him to \n20 \nwork for subminimum wages in order to buy those daily necessities for himself and avoid \n21 \n22  serious harm, including, but not limited to, malnutrition, unsanitary living quarters, \n23 \nextreme isolation, and unhygienic conditions of confinement.   \n24 \n25 \n26 \n \n  2 2 \nPLAINTIFFS’ THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \n   \n     \n \n \n\nC ase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 184   Filed 09/16/19   Page 23 of 59   Page ID\n #:1930\n \n \n1  100.  During  his  detention,  Mr.  Novoa  was  often  undernourished  and \n2 \ndehydrated because GEO withheld sufficient food and water. He was also served rotten \n3 \nmeat, moldy bread, and inedible produce.  \n4 \n5  101.  The drinking water provided by GEO ran black for days at a time and \n6 \ncaused nausea or headaches if ingested. \n7 \n102.  Mr. Novoa lost approximately 30 pounds in detention at the Adelanto \n8 \nFacility.   \n9 \n10  103.  In  order  to  survive,  Mr.  Novoa  purchased  food  and  water  from  the \n11 \ncommissary using his wages from the Work Program. \n12 \n104.  GEO did not provide Mr. Novoa with sufficient quantities of shampoo, \n13 \n14  lotion, or soap. As a result, Mr. Novoa was often forced to purchase those necessities \n15 \nfrom the commissary using his wages from the Work Program.  \n16 \n105.  On several occasions, Mr. Novoa developed a blistering sunburn on his \n17 \n18  face. GEO did not provide him with sunscreen, even after he requested it from medical \n19 \npersonnel.  Instead, Mr. Novoa was forced to purchase sunscreen from the commissary \n20 \nusing his wages form the Work Program.  \n21 \n22  106.  The shoes issued to Mr. Novoa when he arrived at the Adelanto Facility \n23 \nfell apart within his first week in detention. GEO did not replace them. Instead, Mr. \n24 \nNovoa was forced to purchase another pair of shoes from the commissary using his \n25 \n26  wages from the Work Program.  \n \n  2 3 \nPLAINTIFFS’ THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \n   \n     \n \n \n\nC ase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 184   Filed 09/16/19   Page 24 of 59   Page ID\n #:1931\n \n \n1  107.  Mr. Novoa spent his wages on soap, shampoo, lotion, sunscreen, food, \n2 \nclean drinking water, shoes, and other necessities. These items were not provided to Mr. \n3 \nNovoa regularly or in sufficient quantities. Some of these necessities, like sunscreen, \n4 \n5  were not provided to Mr. Novoa at all.   \n6 \n108.  Officers  threatened  to  put  Mr.  Novoa  in  disciplinary  segregation,  i.e., \n7 \nsolitary confinement, if he stopped working, encouraged other detainees to stop working \n8 \nor complained about subminimum wages.    \n9 \n10  109.  On several occasions, officers threatened to or actually forced Mr. Novoa \n11 \nto move to a different dorm – isolated from his peers and friends – after he complained \n12 \nabout the Work Program, subminimum wages and/or the deprivation of necessities at \n13 \n14  the Adelanto Facility.  During these transfers, officers would “toss” Mr. Novoa’s dorm \n15 \nby throwing his belongings and papers in disarray. As a result of these actions, Mr. \n16 \nNovoa felt harassed, intimidated, threatened, and embarrassed.        \n17 \n18  110.  Officers  threatened  to  segregate  detainees  who  complained  about  the \n19 \nWork Program, working conditions, and/or subminimum wages.   \n20 \n111.  From his review of the Detainee Handbook and experience as a detained \n21 \n22  immigrant at Adelanto, Mr. Novoa understood that detainees who disobeyed GEO \n23 \nofficials or refused to clean could be subject to disciplinary action, including solitary \n24 \nconfinement.       \n25 \n26 \n \n  2 4 \nPLAINTIFFS’ THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \n   \n     \n \n \n\nC ase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 184   Filed 09/16/19   Page 25 of 59   Page ID\n #:1932\n \n \n1  112.  If given a meaningful choice, Mr. Novoa would not have worked for $1 \n2 \nper day.  \n3 \n113.

Mr. Novoa provided GEO with his labor because GEO’s threats of serious \n8 \nharm and/or abuse of the legal process if he refused to work. \n9 \n10  115.  GEO retained the value of Mr. Novoa’s labor by realizing this value as \n11 \ncorporate  profits,  rather  than  using  it  to  provide  for  safer,  more  humane  living \n12 \nconditions for detainees at the Adelanto Facility.  \n13 \n14  G.

Mr.  Campos  Fuentes  was  detained  at  the  Adelanto  Facility  from \n19 \nDecember 2016 through January 2018.  \n20 \n118.  Mr.  Campos  Fuentes  has  performed  work  for  GEO  at  the  Adelanto \n21 \n22  Facility and was not paid the state minimum wage for the work he has performed.  \n23 \n119.

He sometimes worked multiple shifts in a \n2 \nsingle day. He used cleaning supplies and equipment provided by GEO. \n3 \n120.  As a laundry worker, Mr. Campos Fuentes worked to sort, wash, dry, and \n4 \n5  fold clothing and bedding used by detainees and in Facility operations. He worked three-\n6 \nhour shifts, up to five days per week. He used supplies and equipment provided by \n7 \nGEO. \n8 \n121.  In return for this labor, GEO paid Mr. Campos Fuentes $1 per day, \n9 \n10 \nregardless of the number of hours he worked. GEO credited these wages to Mr. Campos \n11 \nFuentes’s commissary account.  \n12 \n122.  Sometimes, Mr. Campos Fuentes was not paid for his labor. Instead, he \n13 \n14  was given extra portions of food or nothing at all. \n15 \n123.  GEO officials routinely required detainees to clean the common spaces \n16 \nand bathrooms of the housing units for no compensation. For example, GEO officials \n17 \n18  required Mr. Campos Fuentes to clean bathrooms, showers, floors, sinks, microwaves, \n19 \nand furniture in his housing unit for free. \n20 \n124.  Mr. Campos Fuentes observed GEO officials threaten to lock detainees in \n21 \n22  their cells, suspend their attorney and personal visits, and prohibit them from interacting \n23 \nwith other detained immigrants if they refused to clean areas of the Adelanto Facility for \n24 \nfree.   \n25 \n26 \n \n  2 6 \nPLAINTIFFS’ THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \n   \n     \n \n \n\nC ase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 184   Filed 09/16/19   Page 27 of 59   Page ID\n #:1934\n \n \n1  125.

Plaintiff Abdiaziz Karim’s individual allegations. \n12 \n135.  Mr. Karim is citizen of Somalia and is seeking asylum in the United States.   \n13 \n14  136.  Mr.  Karim  was  detained  at  the  Adelanto  Facility  from  approximately \n15 \nAugust 2017 until August 25, 2019.    \n16 \n137.  Mr. Karim performed work for GEO at the Adelanto Facility and was \n17 \n18  never paid the state minimum wage for the work he performed.  \n19 \n138.  As a porter, Mr. Karim worked in a five to seven-person crew to clean \n20 \nwindows, floors, showers, and communal areas in the Adelanto Facility. He worked up \n21 \n22  to seven days per week. He used cleaning supplies and equipment provided by GEO, \n23 \nand was supervised by GEO employees. \n24 \n139.  Mr. Karim was paid $1 per day for his labor as a porter. However, he was \n25 \n26  not paid at all during his first three months on the job.  \n \n  2 8 \nPLAINTIFFS’ THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \n   \n     \n \n \n\nC ase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 184   Filed 09/16/19   Page 29 of 59   Page ID\n #:1936\n \n \n1  140.  During that period, GEO officials required him to work for free before he \n2 \nwould be hired into the Work Program.  \n3 \n141.  Similarly,  Mr.  Karim  was  not  paid  for  his  labor  as  a  porter  from \n4 \n5  approximately mid-May through July of 2018.  \n6 \n142.  During those months, GEO officials again required him to work without \n7 \ncompensation.   \n8 \n143.  Mr. Karim also worked in the kitchen at the Adelanto Facility. As a food \n9 \n10 \nservice worker, he prepared food, served meals, cleaned the kitchen and dining halls, \n11 \nand washed dishes. He worked from approximately 2:00 a.m. until 8:00 a.m., up to seven \n12 \ndays per week, for about one month.  He used supplies and equipment provided by \n13 \n14  GEO, and was supervised by GEO employees.  \n15 \n144.  Mr. Karim was only paid approximately $1 total – not daily – for his labor \n16 \nin the kitchen. He was told by GEO officials that he had to work for free before he \n17 \n18  would be paid through the Work Program.    \n19 \n145.  On  multiple  occasions,  GEO  officials  ordered  Mr.  Karim  and  other \n20 \ndetained immigrants to clean various areas of the Adelanto Facility, including hallways, \n21 \n22  the visitation area, the kitchen, and the yard, for no compensation.    \n23 \n146.  For example, GEO officials routinely required detained immigrants to \n24 \nclean  the  common  spaces  and  showers  of  Mr.  Karim’s  housing  unit  for  no \n25 \n26  compensation. If detainees refused to clean for free, GEO officials would prohibit all \n \n  2 9 \nPLAINTIFFS’ THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \n   \n     \n \n \n\nC ase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 184   Filed 09/16/19   Page 30 of 59   Page ID\n #:1937\n \n \n1  detained immigrants in the housing area from using the telephones or the showers, and \n2 \nevacuate the day room. When this happened, detained immigrants had to remain in their \n3 \ncells or bunks until a detained immigrant “volunteered” to complete the sanitation and \n4 \n5  cleaning tasks that GEO required.  \n6 \n147.  GEO  officials  have  threatened  to  take  disciplinary  action  against  Mr. \n7 \nKarim for refusing to clean areas of the Adelanto Facility for free. For example, in \n8 \napproximately August 2018, a GEO officer threatened to send Mr. Karim to solitary \n9 \n10 \nconfinement for refusing to clean for no compensation. The same GEO officer “tossed” \n11 \nMr. Karim’s cell by throwing his belongings and papers in disarray, in full view of other \n12 \ndetained immigrants. GEO was able to compel Mr. Karim to work for free because of \n13 \n14  this threatened and actual serious harm.    \n15 \n148.  On another occasion, a GEO official threatened to “write up” Mr. Karim \n16 \nunless he cleaned certain walls and light fixtures in the Adelanto Facility for free. GEO \n17 \n18  officials told Mr. Karim that “write ups” will negatively impact his asylum case. GEO \n19 \nwas able to compel Mr. Karim to work for free because of this threat of serious harm.    \n20 \n149.  GEO knowingly obtained Mr. Karim’s labor by causing him to believe that \n21 \n22  he would suffer serious physical or legal harm – including solitary confinement, transfer \n23 \nto a different housing unit, and harm to his legal case – if he refused to work. \n24 \n150.  Mr.  Karim  participated  in  the  Work  Program  in  order  to  buy  daily \n25 \n26  necessities that GEO failed to provide for him.

GEO withheld daily necessities from Mr. Karim, thereby forcing him to \n4 \n5  work for subminimum wages in order to buy those necessities for himself and avoid \n6 \nserious harm, including, but not limited to, malnutrition, unsanitary living quarters, \n7 \nextreme isolation, and unhygienic conditions of confinement. \n8 \n152.  Mr.  Karim  was  often  undernourished  and  dehydrated  because  GEO \n9 \n10 \nwithheld sufficient food and water. He was served dirty drinking water, rotten fruit, and \n11 \nundercooked chicken. Mr. Karim was rarely served fresh produce. As a result, he lost \n12 \nmuscle mass and hair, and often felt dizzy and weak.  \n13 \n14  153.  Mr. Karim feared that if he stopped participating in the Work Program, he \n15 \nwould not have access to sufficient daily necessities or nutrition.      \n16 \n154.  If given a meaningful choice, Mr. Karim would not work for $1 per day.  \n17 \n18  155.  Mr. Karim provided GEO with his labor because GEO officials threatened  \n19 \nhim with serious harm and/or abuse of the legal process if he refused to work. \n20 \n156.  GEO retained the value of Mr. Karim’s labor by realizing this value as \n21 \n22  corporate  profits,  rather  than  using  it  to  provide  for  safer,  more  humane  living \n23 \nconditions for detainees at the Adelanto Facility.       \n24 \nI.

Mr. Mancia entered the Adelanto Facility as a civil immigration detainee in \n2 \nor around April 2019 and is currently detained there. \n3 \n159.  Mr. Mancia has performed work for GEO at the Adelanto Facility and has \n4 \n5  never been paid the state minimum wage for the work he has performed.  \n6 \n160.  As a food service worker, Mr. Mancia works with a crew of approximately \n7 \na dozen other detained immigrants to prepare food, serve meals, and clean the kitchen \n8 \nand dining halls. He works from approximately 9:00 a.m. until 3:00 p.m., up to seven \n9 \n10 \ndays per week.  He uses cleaning supplies and equipment provided by GEO, and is \n11 \nsupervised by GEO employees. \n12 \n161.  Mr. Mancia is currently paid $1 per day for his labor in the kitchen.    \n13 \n14  162.  Mr. Mancia also works as a porter, but he is not paid for that work. Every \n15 \nday, Mr. Mancia collects trash and empty water jugs from each housing unit, and then \n16 \nrefills and returns the water jugs. He works with a crew of two or three other detainees \n17 \n18  for approximately two hours per day, up to seven days per week. Mr. Mancia uses \n19 \nsupplies and equipment provided by GEO, and is supervised by GEO officials.  \n20 \n163.  Mr. Mancia has never been compensated for his labor as a porter. Instead, \n21 \n22  GEO officials occasionally give him extra food or milk, in violation ICE’s PBNDS and \n23 \nGEO’s contracts with ICE. Sometimes, Mr. Mancia receives nothing at all for his work. \n24 \n164.  Mr.  Mancia  has  performed  other  uncompensated  janitorial  and \n25 \n26  maintenance work for GEO.   \n \n  3 2 \nPLAINTIFFS’ THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \n   \n     \n \n \n\nC ase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 184   Filed 09/16/19   Page 33 of 59   Page ID\n #:1940\n \n \n1  165.  For example, GEO officials have ordered Mr. Mancia to paint a dining hall, \n2 \nclean the medical unit, and clean the recreation yard. He has never been paid for that \n3 \nwork. Instead, GEO officials occasionally give Mr. Mancia extra food, batteries, or \n4 \n5  clothing for his labor. Other times,  he receives nothing at all.   \n6 \n166.  The uncompensated labor GEO ordered Mr. Mancia to perform often \n7 \ncorresponded with impending site visits and inspections by auditors at Adelanto. To \n8 \nleave independent inspectors with a false impression of the state of the Facility and to \n9 \n10 \nhead off any complaints about maintenance, sanitation, and upkeep that could result in \n11 \nadverse audit results, GEO routinely forced Mr. Mancia and other detained immigrants \n12 \nat Adelanto to perform uncompensated labor in advance of inspections. \n13 \n14  167.  Mr.  Mancia  participates  in  the  Work  Program  in  order  to  buy  daily \n15 \nnecessities that GEO fails to provide for him, including food and personal hygiene items.  \n16 \n168.  GEO withholds daily necessities from Mr. Mancia, thereby forcing him to \n17 \n18  work for subminimum wages in order to buy those necessities for himself and avoid \n19 \nserious harm, including, but not limited to malnutrition, unsanitary living quarters, \n20 \nextreme isolation, and unhygienic conditions of confinement.   \n21 \n22  169.  GEO has knowingly obtained Mr. Mancia’s labor by causing him to believe \n23 \nthat he would suffer serious physical or legal harm, including solitary confinement, \n24 \ntransfer to a different housing unit, and harm to his legal case, if he refuses to work. \n25 \n26 \n \n  3 3 \nPLAINTIFFS’ THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \n   \n     \n \n \n\nC ase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 184   Filed 09/16/19   Page 34 of 59   Page ID\n #:1941\n \n \n1  170.  From his review of the Detainee Handbook and experience as a detained \n2 \nimmigrant at Adelanto, Mr. Mancia understands that detainees who disobey GEO \n3 \nofficials  or  refuse  to  clean  can  be  subject  to  disciplinary  action,  including  solitary \n4 \n5  confinement, reporting to ICE, or criminal prosecution.       \n6 \n171.  If given a meaningful choice, Mr. Mancia would not work for $1 per day \n7 \nor no money at all, as GEO has required him to do.   \n8 \n172.  GEO retained the value of Mr. Mancia’s labor by realizing this value as \n9 \n10 \ncorporate  profits,  rather  than  using  it  to  provide  for  safer,  more  humane  living \n11 \nconditions for detainees at Adelanto.       \n12 \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n13 \n14  173.

For  Plaintiffs’  claims  arising  under  the \n21 \n22  California Labor Code and IWC Wage Order No. 5, the California Unfair Competition \n23 \nLaw, and the common law of unjust enrichment, Plaintiffs seek to certify the following \n24 \nclass:    All  civilly  detained  immigrants  who  (i)  were  detained  at  the  Adelanto  ICE \n25 \n26  Processing Center any time between December 19, 2014 and the date of final judgment \n \n  3 4 \nPLAINTIFFS’ THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \n   \n     \n \n \n\nC ase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 184   Filed 09/16/19   Page 35 of 59   Page ID\n #:1942\n \n \n1  in this matter, and either (ii) participated in the Voluntary Work Program at any point \n2 \nduring  their  detention,  or  (iii)  performed  work  for  no  compensation  in  the \n3 \nUncompensated Work Program pending their participation in the Voluntary Work \n4 \n5  Program,  or  (iv)  performed  work  for  no  compensation  pursuant  to  the  Adelanto \n6 \nHousing Unit Sanitation Policy (the “California Wage Class”). \n7 \n175.  The California Forced Labor Class. For Plaintiffs’ claim for forced labor \n8 \narising under the California Trafficking Victims Protection Act, Plaintiffs seek to certify \n9 \n10 \nthe following class: All civil immigration detainees who (i) were detained at the Adelanto \n11 \nICE Processing Center any time between May 1, 2011 and the date of final judgment in \n12 \nthis matter, and (ii) performed janitorial, maintenance, or other work at the Adelanto \n13 \n14  ICE  Processing  Center  above  and  beyond  the  four  personal  housekeeping  tasks \n15 \nenumerated in ICE PBNDS § 5.8.V.C (the “California Forced Labor Class”).   \n16 \n176.  The Nationwide HUSP Class. For Plaintiffs’ claim for forced labor \n17 \n18  arising under the federal Trafficking Victims Protection Act, Plaintiffs seek to certify the \n19 \nfollowing  class:  All  civilly  detained  immigrants  who  (i)  were  detained  at  any  civil \n20 \nimmigration detention center owned or operated by GEO in the United States between \n21 \n22  December 19, 2007 and the date of final judgment in this matter, and (ii) performed  \n23 \njanitorial, maintenance, or other work anywhere in any GEO civil immigration detention \n24 \nfacility above and beyond the four personal housekeeping tasks enumerated in ICE \n25 \n26  PBNDS § 5.8.V.C (the “Nationwide HUSP Class”).  \n \n  3 5 \nPLAINTIFFS’ THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \n   \n     \n \n \n\nC ase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 184   Filed 09/16/19   Page 36 of 59   Page ID\n #:1943\n \n \n1  177.  Excluded from the definition of the Nationwide HUSP Class are the \n2 \nfollowing: (1) individuals detained in GEO’s family residential detention facility in \n3 \nKarnes  City,  Texas;  (2)  individuals  detained  in  the  Alexandria  Staging  Facility  in \n4 \n5  Alexandria, Louisiana; (3) any individual detained in the custody of the U.S. Marshalls \n6 \nor any other law enforcement agency at a GEO facility where the company also detains \n7 \ncivil immigration detainees pursuant to contracts with ICE; and (4) civilly detained \n8 \nimmigrants detainees held at the Aurora ICE Processing Center in Aurora, Colorado at \n9 \n10 \nany time before October 22, 2014. \n11 \n178.  The Adelanto Forced Labor Class. For Plaintiffs’ claim for attempted \n12 \nforced labor arising under the federal Trafficking Victims Protection Act, Plaintiffs seek \n13 \n14  to certify the following class: All civilly detained immigrants who (i) were detained at the \n15 \nAdelanto ICE Processing Center any time between May 1, 2011 and the date of final \n16 \njudgment in this matter, and (ii) participated in the Work Program or Uncompensated \n17 \n18  Work Program at any point during their detention. (The “Adelanto Forced Labor \n19 \nClass”).  \n20 \n179.  Excluded from each class definition are the defendants, their officers, \n21 \n22  directors, management, subsidiaries, and affiliates, and all federal governmental entities. \n23 \nPlaintiffs reserve the right to revise the class definitions based upon information learned \n24 \nthrough discovery. \n25 \n26   \n \n  3 6 \nPLAINTIFFS’ THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \n   \n     \n \n \n\nC ase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 184   Filed 09/16/19   Page 37 of 59   Page ID\n #:1944\n \n \n1  B.  Class Certification Requirements under Rule 23  \n2 \n180.  Numerosity:  Rule 23(a)(1). Each class is so numerous that joinder of all \n3 \nmembers is impracticable.  Plaintiffs do not know the exact size of the classes, since that \n4 \n5  information is within the control of GEO. However, Adelanto can house up to 1,940 \n6 \nindividuals, with a guaranteed minimum of 1,455 filled beds daily. Further, “the total \n7 \nnumber of participants in the Work Program at the Adelanto Facility since December \n8 \n19, 2007 exceeds 1,000.” ECF 45 at 6.  With respect to the Nationwide HUSP Class, \n9 \n10 \nGEO’s facilities house more than 10,000 civilly detained immigrants each night, all of \n11 \nwhom are subject to the uncompensated labor requirements and corresponding threats \n12 \nof GEO’s HUSPs and facility discipline policies. Accordingly, Plaintiffs allege that the \n13 \n14  number of class members for each class is numbered in the thousands. Membership in \n15 \neach class is readily ascertainable from GEO’s detention and employment records.   \n16 \n181.  Commonality and Predominance:  Rules 23(a)(2) and 23(b)(3). There \n17 \n18  are  numerous  questions  of  law  or  fact  common  to  each  class,  and  those  issues \n19 \npredominate over any question affecting only individual class members.  \n20 \n182.  With respect to the California Wage Class, the common legal and factual \n21 \n22  issues include the following: \n23 \na.  Whether GEO is an “employer” and the detained immigrant workers \n24  are “employees” under the California Minimum Wage Law (“MWL”);  \n \n25 \nb.  Whether Plaintiffs and California Wage Class Members are entitled to \n26  the protections of the California Minimum Wage Order;  \n \n \n  3 7 \nPLAINTIFFS’ THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \n   \n     \n \n \n\nC ase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 184   Filed 09/16/19   Page 38 of 59   Page ID\n #:1945\n \n \n1  c.

With respect to the California Forced Labor Class, common legal and \n14 \nfactual issues include the following: \n15 \n16  a.  Whether GEO unlawfully forces, coerces, or otherwise compels civil \nimmigration detainees at Adelanto to work for no compensation; \n17 \n \n18  b.  Whether GEO obtains detained immigrant labor through threats of \nserious harm  or abuse of legal process;  \n19 \n \n20  c.  Whether  GEO’s  HUSPs  require  detained  immigrants  to  perform \njanitorial,  maintenance,  or  other  work  above  and  beyond  the  four \n21 \npersonal housekeeping tasks enumerated in the ICE PBNDS;  \n22   \nd.  Whether GEO’s conduct violates the California Trafficking Victims \n23 \nProtection Act; \n24   \ne.

Whether Plaintiffs and California Forced Labor Class Members are \nentitled  to  damages  and  other  monetary  relief  and,  if  so,  in  what \n2 \namount. \n3   \n184.  With respect to the Nationwide HUSP Class, common legal and factual \n4 \n5  issues include the following: \n6 \na.  Whether GEO forces, coerces, or otherwise compels civil immigration \ndetainees at its civil immigration detention centers nationwide to work \n7 \nfor no compensation; \n8 \n \nb.  Whether GEO threatens detained immigrants with serious harm or \n9 \nabuse of legal process for refusing or failing to perform uncompensated \n10 \nwork;  \n \n11 \nc.  Whether GEO maintains HUSPs at its civil immigration detention \n12  centers nationwide; \n \n13 \nd.

Whether  GEO’s  conduct  violates  the  federal  Trafficking  Victims \nProtection Act;  \n17 \n \n18  f.  Whether Plaintiffs and Nationwide HUSP Class Members are entitled \nto equitable relief, including injunctive and declaratory relief; and \n19 \n \n20  g.  Whether Plaintiffs and Nationwide HUSP Class Members are entitled \nto damages and other monetary relief and, if so, in what amount. \n21 \n \n22  185.  With respect to the Adelanto Forced Labor Class, common legal and \n23 \nfactual issues include the following: \n24 \na.  Whether  GEO  withholds  basic  living  necessities  from  immigrants \n25 \ndetained at Adelanto;  \n26   \n \n  3 9 \nPLAINTIFFS’ THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \n   \n     \n \n \n\nC ase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 184   Filed 09/16/19   Page 40 of 59   Page ID\n #:1947\n \n \n1  b.  Whether GEO attempts to compel detainees to work, either through \nthe Work Program or otherwise, through threats of serious harm;  \n2 \n \nc.  Whether a reasonable person would provide labor to GEO under the \n3 \ncircumstances present here;  \n4 \n \nd.  Whether  GEO’s  conduct  violates  the  federal  Trafficking  Victims \n5 \nProtection Act; and \n6   \ne.  Whether Plaintiffs and Adelanto Forced Labor Class Members are \n7 \nentitled to equitable relief, including injunctive and declaratory relief. \n8   \n186.  Typicality: Rule 23(a)(3).  The claims asserted by Plaintiffs are typical of \n9 \nthe claims of the Classes, in that the representative plaintiffs, like all class members, were \n10 \n11  paid subminimum wages – or nothing at all – while employed by GEO at the Adelanto \n12 \nFacility. Each Plaintiff, like each class member, was subject to similar GEO policies and \n13 \npractices, including the HUSP and the Work Program, and each faced the threat of \n14 \n15  serious harm for refusing to work. Each member of each proposed class has been \n16 \nsimilarly injured by GEO’s misconduct. \n17 \n187.  Adequacy:  Rule 23(a)(4). Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the \n18 \n19  interests  of  the  classes.  Plaintiffs  have  retained  attorneys  experienced  in  class  and \n20 \ncomplex litigation, including wage and hour class action litigation. Plaintiffs intend to \n21 \nvigorously prosecute this litigation. Neither Plaintiffs nor their counsel have interests \n22 \n23  that conflict with the interests of the other class members.  \n24 \n188.  Superiority:  Rules 23(b)(3). Plaintiffs and the Class Members have all \n25 \nsuffered and will continue to suffer harm and damages as a result of GEO’s wrongful \n26 \nconduct. A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \n \n  4 0 \nPLAINTIFFS’ THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \n   \n     \n \n \n\nC ase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 184   Filed 09/16/19   Page 41 of 59   Page ID\n #:1948\n \n \n1  adjudication of the controversy. Treatment as a class action will permit a large number \n2 \nof  similarly  situated  persons  to  adjudicate  their  common  claims  in  a  single  forum \n3 \nsimultaneously,  efficiently,  and  without  the  duplication  of  effort  and  expense  that \n4 \n5  numerous  individual  actions  would  engender.  Class  treatment  will  also  permit  the \n6 \nadjudication  of  claims  by  many  members  of  the  proposed  classes  who  could  not \n7 \nindividually afford to litigate a claim such as is asserted in this complaint. This class \n8 \naction likely presents no difficulties in management that would preclude maintenance as \n9 \n10 \na class action.  \n11 \n189.  Rule 23(b)(2). This action concerns GEO policies and practices that place \n12 \nevery detainee at the Adelanto and GEO’s other civil immigration detention facilities in \n13 \n14  peril of wage theft, forced labor, attempted forced labor, and serious harm. All members \n15 \nof the California Forced Labor Class, Nationwide HUSP Class, and Adelanto Forced \n16 \nLabor  Class  seek  the  same  injunctive  relief.  Accordingly,  final  injunctive  relief  or \n17 \n18  corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.   \n19 \nCAUSES OF ACTION \n20   \nCOUNT I \n21 \n  CALIFORNIA MINIMUM WAGE LAW \n22  Cal.

The California Legislature set the following minimum wages for 2011-\n2 \n2019:19 \n3 \nJanuary 1, 2019  $12.00 for employers with 26 employees or more \n4 \n5  January 1, 2017  $10.50 for employers with 26 employees or more \n6 \nJanuary 1, 2014  $9.00 \n7 \nJanuary 1, 2008  $8.00 \n8 \n9   \n10 \n192.  The minimum wage is an obligation of the employer and cannot be waived \n11 \nby any agreement.   \n12 \n13  193.  Detained immigrants at the Adelanto Facility do not forfeit their rights to \n14 \nwage protections.  \n15 \n194.  Employees protected by California’s minimum wage laws must be paid at \n16 \nleast the set hourly minimum wage. \n17 \n18  195.  Detained immigrants at the Adelanto Facility who participate in the Work \n19 \nProgram qualify as employees of GEO under California law. \n20 \n196.  GEO qualifies as an employer under California law, including Industrial \n21 \n22  Wage Commission (“IWC”) Order 5. \n23 \n24 \n25 \n \n26 \n19 See http://www.dir.ca.gov/iwc/MinimumWageHistory.htm/; \n  https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/faq_minimumwage.htm  \n  4 2 \nPLAINTIFFS’ THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \n   \n     \n \n \n\nC ase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 184   Filed 09/16/19   Page 43 of 59   Page ID\n #:1950\n \n \n1  197.  Labor in the immigration detention context is not intended as a punitive \n2 \nmeasure.      \n3 \n198.  GEO does not compensate detained immigrants the state minimum wage \n4 \n5  for the work they performed at the Adelanto Facility. Instead, GEO pays detainees $1 \n6 \nper day – or nothing at all -- for work they perform at the Facility. Sometimes, GEO \n7 \npays detainees with extra food, batteries, socks, or boxers.   \n8 \n199.  Plaintiffs and California Wage Class Members have suffered damages in an \n9 \n10 \namount to be determined at trial. \n11 \n200.

GEO materially and significantly reduced its labor costs and expenses, and \n2 \nincreased its profits, because Plaintiffs and California Wage Class Members perform \n3 \nundercompensated labor. \n4 \n5  205.  Plaintiffs and California Wage Class Members conferred non-gratuitous \n6 \nbenefits  upon  GEO  by  performing  work  for  $1  per  day,  for  which  GEO  would \n7 \notherwise have had to pay at least the applicable minimum wage or more, thereby \n8 \nsignificantly and materially increasing GEO’s profits, unjustly enriching GEO at the \n9 \n10 \nexpense of and detriment to Plaintiffs and California Wage Class Members. \n11 \n206.  GEO’s retention of any benefit collected directly and indirectly from this \n12 \nuncompensated labor violated principles of justice, equity, and good conscience.  \n13 \n14  207.  As a direct and proximate result of GEO’s forced labor practices, Plaintiffs \n15 \nand California Wage Class Members have suffered concrete harm and injury, including \n16 \nphysical and emotional injury, monetary loss, and the unlawful violation of their rights.      \n17 \n18  208.

The acts, omissions, and practices of GEO constitute unfair and unlawful \n16 \nbusiness acts and practices under the UCL in that GEO’s conduct offends public policy \n17 \n18  against forced labor, and seeks to profit by violating Plaintiffs’ rights under state and \n19 \nfederal law.  \n20 \n216.  As a direct and proximate result of GEO’s unlawful and unfair business \n21 \n22  practices, Plaintiffs and California Wage Class Members have suffered economic injury.  \n23 \n217.

GEO materially and significantly reduced its labor costs and expenses, and \n19 \n20  increased its profits, by unlawfully forcing and coercing Plaintiffs and California Forced \n21 \nLabor Class Members to perform uncompensated labor. In order to drive profits, GEO \n22 \nacted with the intent to obtain forced labor or services from its detainees. \n23 \n24  226.

Serious harm is defined as “any harm, whether physical or nonphysical, \n2 \nincluding psychological, financial, or reputational harm, that is sufficiently serious, under \n3 \nall  the  surrounding  circumstances,  to  compel  a  reasonable  person  of  the  same \n4 \n5  background and in the same circumstances to perform or to continue performing labor \n6 \nor services in order to avoid incurring that harm.” 18 U.S.C. § 1589(c). \n7 \n234.  GEO provides or obtains the labor or services of Plaintiffs and Nationwide \n8 \nHUSP Class Members by means of physical restraint or threats of physical restraint to \n9 \n10 \nPlaintiffs and others. 18 U.S.C. § 1589(a)(1). \n11 \n235.  GEO  also  provides  or  obtains  the  labor  or  services  of  Plaintiffs  and \n12 \nNationwide HUSP Class Members by means of serious harm or threats of serious harm. \n13 \n14  18 U.S.C. § 1589(a)(2). \n15 \n236.  GEO  provided  or  obtained  the  labor  or  services  of  Plaintiffs  and \n16 \nNationwide HUSP Class Members by means of a scheme, plan, or pattern intended to \n17 \n18  cause them to believe that, if they did not perform such labor or services, they would \n19 \nsuffer serious harm or physical restraint, including solitary confinement. 18 U.S.C. § 1589 \n20 \n(a)(4). \n21 \n22  237.  GEO violates 18 U.S.C. §§ 1589(a) and 1594(a) by knowingly maintaining \n23 \ncorporate policies and uniform practices at most of its civil immigration detention \n24 \ncenters aimed at obtaining free detainee labor and services by:   \n25 \n26  a.

GEO materially and significantly reduced its labor costs and expenses, and  \n11 \nincreased its profits, by unlawfully forcing and coercing Plaintiffs and Nationwide HUSP \n12 \nClass Members to perform uncompensated labor. In order to drive profits, GEO acted \n13 \n14  with the intent to obtain forced labor or services from its detainees. \n15 \n239.

GEO attempts to violate 18 U.S.C. § 1589(a)(2) by knowingly maintaining  \n14 \ncorporate policies and uniform practices at the Adelanto Facility aimed at obtaining free \n15 \n16  or nearly free detainee labor and services by:   \n17 \na.

GEO  further  violated  18  U.S.C.  §§  1589  and  1594  by  maintaining  a \n2 \ncorporate policy and uniform practice at the Adelanto Facility of threatening Plaintiffs \n3 \nand  Adelanto  Forced  Labor  Class  Members  with  serious  harm,  including  solitary \n4 \n5  confinement, referral to an ICE officer, or criminal prosecution if they refused to work. \n6 \n248.  GEO  attempts  and  perpetrates  the  offense  of  forced  labor  against \n7 \nPlaintiffs and Adelanto Forced Labor Class Members. \n8 \n249.  GEO  knowingly  benefitted  financially  from  participation  in  a  venture \n9 \n10 \nGEO knew or should have known engaged in unlawful coercion of labor in violation of \n11 \n18 U.S.C. §§ 1589(a) and 1594(a). \n12 \n250.  Plaintiffs  and  Adelanto  Forced  Labor  Class  Members  have  suffered \n13 \n14  damages in an amount to be determined at trial.  \n15 \n251.  Plaintiffs  and  Adelanto  Forced  Labor  Class  Members  are  entitled  to \n16 \nrecover compensatory and punitive damages.   \n17 \n18  252.

Plaintiffs brought a reply counterclaim for retaliation against GEO on July \n4 \n5  24, 2018. ECF No. 50. \n6 \n256.  GEO answered Plaintiffs’ reply counterclaim for retaliation on August 14, \n7 \n2018. ECF No. 58. \n8 \n257.  On November 30, 2018, the Court dismissed GEO’s counterclaim for \n9 \n10 \n“unjust enrichment/offset” with prejudice. ECF No. 101. \n11 \n258.  On  December  19,  2018,  GEO  filed  its  First  Amended  Answer  and \n12 \nCounterclaim to Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint, ECF No. 106, wherein GEO \n13 \n14  alleged, again, a counterclaim against Plaintiff Novoa and “against any putative class or \n15 \nclasses certified by the Court” for “declaratory relief.” \n16 \n259.  Plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Complaint on December 24, 2018. \n17 \n18  ECF No. 108. \n19 \n260.  On January 28, 2019, GEO filed its Answer and Counterclaim to Plaintiffs’ \n20 \nSecond  Amended  Complaint,  ECF  No.  113,  yet  again  alleging  a  conditional \n21 \n22  counterclaim for “declaratory relief” against Plaintiffs and “any putative class or classes \n23 \ncertified by the Court.” \n24 \n25 \n26 \n \n  5 3 \nPLAINTIFFS’ THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \n   \n     \n \n \n\nC ase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 184   Filed 09/16/19   Page 54 of 59   Page ID\n #:1961\n \n \n1  261.  On  February  18,  2019,  Plaintiffs  filed  their  Answer  and  Affirmative \n2 \nDefenses to GEO’s Conditional Counterclaim and again brought a reply counterclaim \n3 \nfor retaliation against GEO. ECF No. 117. \n4 \n5  262.  GEO’s counterclaim for “declaratory relief” is a retaliatory in terrorem tactic \n6 \nagainst Plaintiffs and the class members for bringing their claims to court.  \n7 \n263.  Plaintiff Raul Novoa was detained at the Adelanto Facility from June 2012 \n8 \nthrough February 2015. \n9 \n10  264.  On December 19, 2017, Plaintiff Novoa, on behalf of himself and all \n11 \nothers similarly situated, filed a class action complaint seeking money damages and \n12 \ninjunctive relief from GEO for the continued and unlawful economic exploitation of \n13 \n14  civil immigration detainees at the Adelanto ICE Detention Center. ECF No. 1. By filing \n15 \nthis lawsuit, Plaintiff Novoa engaged in a protected activity. \n16 \n265.  GEO waited until July 3, 2018 – more than three years after Plaintiff \n17 \n18  Novoa was released from the Adelanto Facility, and only after this Court denied in part \n19 \nGEO’s motion to dismiss – to file its counterclaims against Mr. Novoa and all putative \n20 \nclass members for “unjust enrichment/offset” and “declaratory relief.”  \n21 \n22  266.  GEO’s  motive  in  bringing  these  counterclaims  is  to  retaliate  against \n23 \nPlaintiffs and deter the class members – thousands of vulnerable and indigent individuals \n24 \n– from exercising their protected right to litigate their claims against GEO. \n25 \n26 \n \n  5 4 \nPLAINTIFFS’ THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \n   \n     \n \n \n\nC ase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 184   Filed 09/16/19   Page 55 of 59   Page ID\n #:1962\n \n \n1  267.  GEO’s counterclaim targets each and every putative class member, i.e. \n2 \nevery individual who has been civilly detained at Adelanto since May 1, 2011. \n3 \n268.  GEO has a strong financial interest in deterring Plaintiffs and the putative \n4 \n5  class members from prosecuting their case. \n6 \n269.  GEO represented to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth \n7 \nCircuit that a similar federal class action lawsuit currently pending Colorado “poses a \n8 \npotentially catastrophic risk to GEO’s ability to honor its contracts with the federal \n9 \n10 \ngovernment.” Petition for Permission to Appeal Class Certification at 30, Menocal et al. \n11 \nv.  The  GEO  Group,  Inc.,  No.14-02887  (10th  Cir.  March  13,  2017)  (“potentially \n12 \ncatastrophic risk”). \n13 \n14  270.  GEO’s counterclaim for “declaratory relief” is wholly without merit and is \n15 \nreasonably likely to deter the protected activity of filing and prosecuting a lawsuit. \n16 \n271.  Plaintiffs’  counterclaim  in  reply  of  retaliation  arises  out  of  the  same \n17 \n18  transaction or occurrence and the same set of aggregate facts that are the subject matter \n19 \nof GEO’s counterclaims. \n20 \n272.  Plaintiffs’ counterclaim in reply does not require adding another party over \n21 \n22  whom the Court cannot acquire jurisdiction. \n23 \n273.  Plaintiffs are entitled to an Order enjoining GEO from continuing to \n24 \nretaliate against Plaintiffs and class members; declaratory and other equitable relief as is \n25 \n26  necessary  to  protect  the  interests  of  Plaintiffs  and  class  members;  and  Plaintiffs’ \n \n  5 5 \nPLAINTIFFS’ THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \n   \n     \n \n \n\nC ase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 184   Filed 09/16/19   Page 56 of 59   Page ID\n #:1963\n \n \n1  reasonable  expenses  and  attorney’s  fees  incurred  as  a  result  of  defending  GEO’s \n2 \nfrivolous counterclaim. \n3 \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n4 \n5  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs, individually and on behalf of the classes they seek to \n6 \nrepresent, request that the Court:   \n7 \na.

INTRODUCTION \n2 Plaintiffs’  application  for  a  Temporary  Restraining  Order  (“TRO”)  on  an \n3 emergency  basis  does  not  seek  relief  related  to  COVID-19.  Rather,  it  uses  the \n4 pandemic, and the justifiable unease throughout  the country, to  make an end run \n5 around the remaining process in the current case and skip to the merits of whether \n6 GEO’s policies relating to detainees’ cleanup of their living areas constitutes forced \n7 labor under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (“TVPA”) 18 U.S.C. § 1589 et. \n8 seq. This regrettable exploitation of the COVID-19 crisis facing the nation should not \n9 be tolerated by this Court.  \n10 Plaintiffs provide absolutely no evidence that detainees are at a higher risk of \n11 contracting COVID-19 by cleaning up after themselves in their general living areas. \n2 \nE 300 0071 27-634 12 Nor  do  they  provide  a  legal  justification  that  housekeeping  tasks,  in  the  current \nRMAN LLP  TH STREET, SUITS, CALIFORNIA 9500 – FAX: (213) 6 111345 Cae nOhsuiVgrIheD er-t h1ra9its  ekbn vaosifri coc notmnetnerenatcts,t  ivnoigof  laCpteOer VsthoIenD aT-l1 V9hP yAbgy.i e Incnoed meaeprdle,y  iifnto gils l owuwnitechdl e.aa  rIp th oodliwecfy id eetsht aariten aesseeosrnv a ersteh  taaott   \nE FE9\nAK T FIGEL688- 16 reducing detainees diligence and responsibility for their own personal hygiene would \n601 WESLOS ANEL.: (213)  17 be an appropriate response to COVID-19—let alone one this Court should endorse. \nT\n18 While cleanliness is always important, it is of paramount importance now. \n19 Furthermore, a nationwide injunction is not appropriate here. Plaintiffs have not \n20 produced evidence from all facilities related to their current claims, instead relying \n21 upon declarations from only two (2) facilities. See ECF 253 (containing declarations \n22 from two (2) facilities). As Justice Thomas recently explained, nationwide injunctions \n23 “are beginning to take a toll on the federal court system—preventing legal questions \n24 from percolating through the federal courts, encouraging forum shopping, and making \n25 every case a national emergency for the courts and for the Executive Branch.” Trump \n26 v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392, 2425, 201 L. Ed. 2d 775 (2018). This is surely true here \n27 where Plaintiffs seek nothing more than a preview of this Court’s opinion on the \n28 merits of their claim, wholly unrelated to COVID-19. This Court should not be thrust \n52631576;4  1  CASE NO. 5:17-CV-02514-JGB-SHKX \nDEFENDANT THE GEO GROUP, INC.'S OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' EX PARTE \nAPPLICATION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 255   Filed 04/08/20   Page 8 of 29   Page ID #:5250\n \n1 into “rushed, high-stakes, low-information decisions” regarding a novel and complex \n2 application of the TVPA absent concrete evidence that doing so would alleviate the \n3 spread of COVID-19. Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. New York, 140 S. Ct. 599, 600 \n4 (2020) (Gorsuch, J., concurring). For these reasons, Plaintiffs’ TRO should be denied.  \n5 II.  GEO’S RESPONSE TO COVID-19. \n6 Plaintiffs’ TRO presents a broad overview of the current pandemic facing the \n7 United States, but fails to provide any information about the extensive response by \n8 both GEO and ICE within detention facilities to curtail detainee exposure to COVID-\n9 19  and  ensure  the  safety  and  security  of  all  those  who  live  and  work  at  GEO \n10 facilities.1 In so doing, Plaintiffs paint a picture of inevitable spread within the GEO \n11 facilities  which  they  claim  can  be  redressed  only  through  the  elimination  of \n2 \nE 300 0071 27-634 12 housekeeping  requirements.  ECF  251-1.  To  the  contrary,  GEO  (and  ICE)  have \nRMAN LLP  TH STREET, SUITS, CALIFORNIA 9500 – FAX: (213) 6 111345 iosmifm paillelalm r deteont taemidni elelexisop.n asnT shaicrvoreou spgsoh l tihctheie escs eot ou pnaotdrlydic—reessw,s  itGthhEe  aOCd OddeVedtI aDpirn-e1ec9eas ur itsaiokrens  sa cntuodr  retehnnestiluryr  edc atohilheya  sblaiivtfieentsyg,   \nE FE9\nAK T FIGEL688- 16 diligent personal hygiene, and regimented social distancing.  \n601 WESLOS ANEL.: (213)  17 Among these measures, GEO has created polices at its facilities2 consistent with \nT                                            \n18\n1 The certified class includes 12 facilities: Adelanto, Aurora, Broward, Mesa Verde, Montgomery, \n19 Northwest/Tacoma, South Texas, Folkston, Joe Corley, LaSalle, Pine Prairie, and South Louisiana. \nBecause Plaintiffs bear the burden of establishing a TRO is proper, and because Plaintiffs have \n20\nsubmitted declaration evidence related only to LaSalle Ice Processing Center (“LIPC”) and Aurora \nICE Processing Center (“Aurora”), GEO focuses on those facilities in this response. GEO further \n21\nnotes that the “submission of general news articles does not constitute ‘material’ evidence” and \n22 therefore should not be considered to be “evidence” by this Court. Geagea v. Holder, 466 F. App’x \n502, 508 (6th Cir. 2012). \n23 2  For  purposes  of  this  motion,  GEO  addresses  those  facilities  for  which  Plaintiffs’  submitted \nevidence: LIPC and Aurora. Plaintiffs submitted three (3) declarations from detainees at the LIPC \n24\nand one (1) from Aurora. GEO also submits evidence from the Adelanto facility, even though the \nnamed Plaintiffs were not detained during the pendency of COVID-19, their experiences are limited \n25\nto the Adelanto facility where they were detained. GEO also presents evidence from the Northwest \n26 Ice Processing Center in Tacoma, Washington (“NWIPC”) because the declaration submitted herein \nis publicly available on PACER. Given the truncated response time for this response, GEO was \n27 limited to evidence from these facilities. Given additional time, GEO could submit information \nabout other facilities about which the Court has concerns. That said, Plaintiffs bear the initial burden \n28\nand have failed to present any evidence as to the majority of GEO facilities that are part of the \n52631576;4  2  CASE NO. 5:17-CV-02514-JGB-SHKX \nDEFENDANT THE GEO GROUP, INC.'S OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' EX PARTE \nAPPLICATION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 255   Filed 04/08/20   Page 9 of 29   Page ID #:5251\n \n1 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Interim Guidance on Management of \n2 Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities. See \n3 Declaration of David Van Pelt, Exs. 1 (Dec. of Janecka), 2 (Dec. of Ceja), 3 (Dec. of \n4 Cole), and 4 (Dec. of Langford). With these principles in mind, GEO has enhanced \n5 information, limited exposure from outside visitors, and increased sanitation. Id. As a \n6 result of these measures, the LIPC, Aurora, NWIDC, and the Adelanto ICE Processing \n7 Center (“Adelanto Facility”) do not have any reported cases of COVID-19.3 Exs. 1, 2, \n8 3, 4, and 5 (Dec. of Valdez).  \n9 As to increased information for detainees, GEO has held multiple town hall \n10 meetings for detainees whereby detainees can ask medical professionals questions \n11 about COVID-19. Exs. 1, 2, 3, and 4. These town halls serve to keep detainees aware \n2 \nE 300 0071 27-634 12 of the ongoing situation. Id.

Exs. 1, 2, 3, and 4. Attorneys who wish to enter the building \n20 must wear Personal Protective Equipment (“PPE”) including a surgical mask, goggles, \n21 and gloves. Id. Otherwise, all visits are restricted to videoconferencing on tablets that \n22 are provided to detainees. Id. All individuals entering the facilities, including GEO \n23 employees and ICE staff, must pass a screening for COVID-19 including completing a \n24 questionnaire and having their temperature taken. Any individuals with a fever or who \n25 report recent travel or symptoms on their questionnaires are denied access. Id.

The facilities have placed restrictions on any new \n5 detainees who arrive at the facility. Exs.1, 2, 3, and 4. Detainees are screened for \n6 COVID-19 exposure prior to entering the building; detainees who present symptoms \n7 or other travel related risks for exposure to COVID-19 are either turned away or \n8 housed in medical negative pressure rooms.

See Stuhlbarg Int’l Sales Co. v. \nT\n18 John D.Brush & Co., 240 F.3d 832, 839 n.7 (9th Cir. 2001). Injunctive relief is an \n19 extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff \n20 is entitled to such relief.” See Winter v. Natural Res. Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. \n21 7, 2 (2008). In seeking injunctive relief, Plaintiffs “face a difficult task in proving that \n22 [they are] entitled to this ‘extraordinary remedy’.” See Earth Island Inst. v. Carlton, \n23 626 F.3d 462, 469 (9th Cir. 2010), citing Winter, supra, 555 U.S. at 23. A plaintiff \n24 “must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer \n25 irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips \n26 in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.” Am.

And, none of the movants have demonstrated an elevated risk of \n601 WESLOS ANEL.: (213)  17 COVID-19 due to any acts or omissions of GEO. COVID-19 was not a pressing \nT\n18 concern when this case was certified, or when Plaintiffs were detained, and therefore \n19 Plaintiffs have not established that they have suffered injuries related to the COVID-\n20 19 specific relief they seek here. Plaintiffs have not submitted any additional evidence \n21 that would support a finding that they have standing. To be sure, there is no risk that \n22 any of the named Plaintiffs, all of whom live outside of the GEO facilities, and one (1) \n23 of whom lives in Somalia. Put simply, none of the Plaintiffs have met their burden to \n24 show  they  are  at  an  increased  harm  of  COVID-19  because  of  the  housekeeping \n25 policies within GEO-ICE detention centers. Thus, they lack standing to bring this \n26 TRO since regardless of the outcome, their status quo will remain unchanged and they \n27 will suffer no injury. See Gill v.

Plaintiffs Cannot Establish That Their Proposed Relief is \n3 Likely to Redress Concerns about the Spread of COVID-\n4 19. \n5 To  establish  standing,  Plaintiffs  must  also  demonstrate  “a  ‘substantial \n6 likelihood’ that the relief sought would redress the injury. Mayfield v. United States, \n7 599 F.3d 964, 971 (9th Cir. 2010). They cannot do so here.  \n8 Despite  opening  their  brief  with  a  bold  and  unsupported  statement  that \n9 “COVID-19 has found its way into GEO detention facilities,”6 the GEO facilities \n10 where all declarants and Plaintiffs were formerly detained7 currently have zero cases \n11 of COVID-19.

Ms. Dejaso submitted a declaration for a case unrelated to the present case which \n22 states that as of March 27th she was detained at the LIPC. ECF 253-2. Ms. Bosque also submitted a \ndeclaration dated March 27th for a separate case stating that she is currently detained at the LIPC. \n23 ECF 253-1. Neither individual as able to sign their declaration. ECF 253-1, 235-2. Ms. Barrios did \nnot submit a declaration herself, rather her attorney submitted a declaration in an unrelated case \n24\ndescribing his understanding of their conversation—which creates obvious hearsay issues. ECF 253-\n4. Surely, Plaintiffs could have, at a minimum reached out to Ms. Barrios’ attorney and asked him \n25\nfor a declaration specific to this case but did not do so. Ms. Barrios’ declarations should not be \n26 considered by this Court because they were not created for this action, do not directly address the \nclams at issue here, and are not subject to cross-examination. To the extent the Court considers her \n27 declaration, it states that she was detained at the LIPC as of April 1, 2020.  \n8 To the contrary, the CDC has made clear that cleaning one’s living area helps prevent the spread of \n28\nCOVID-19.

And, Plaintiffs do not \n3 seek to have detainees who participate in that cleaning program enjoined from doing \n4 so. Id. Thus, even if successful, any order will not enjoin all detainee cleaning, just a \n5 small subset of detainees. Certainly, even assuming arguendo that reduced cleaning \n6 could somehow help prevent the spread of COVID-19, the relief Plaintiffs seek will \n7 not meaningfully stop the spread of COVID-19.

This omission is perhaps the most telling indication of \n26 how tenuously tied to COVID-19 Plaintiffs’ motion truly is.  \n10 GEO notes that Ms. Dejaso complains about her participation in the VWP, referencing the dollar \n27 per day she is paid. These duties would continue even if Plaintiffs receive all relief they seek here as \nPlaintiffs do not seek to halt the operation of the VWP. Nor could they as their claim that detainees \n28\nshould be classified as “employees” does not provide relief from performing the tasks in question.  \n52631576;4  9  CASE NO. 5:17-CV-02514-JGB-SHKX \nDEFENDANT THE GEO GROUP, INC.'S OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' EX PARTE \nAPPLICATION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 255   Filed 04/08/20   Page 16 of 29   Page ID\n #:5258\n \n1 133 S.Ct. 2390, 185 L.Ed.2d 1116 (2013). Here, Plaintiffs present no evidence that \n2 ending general housekeeping policies would make it less likely for individuals to \n3 contract COVID-19 in the future. Plaintiffs concede that “[s]ocial distancing, i.e., \n4 physical  separation  from  known  or  potentially  infected  individuals,  and  vigilant \n5 hygiene, including washing hands with soap and water, are the only known effective \n6 measures for protecting vulnerable people from COVID-19.” ECF 252-1, 10. GEO \n7 currently ensures both of these measures have been implemented in its facilities. See \n8 Exs. 1, 2, , 3, 4, 5. GEO abides by social distancing, to the extent possible in a \n9 detention setting, by reducing the number of detainees in each living unit, reducing \n10 who comes and goes from each facility, reducing the number of individuals  who \n11 participate in various programs including library time and recreation, and limiting \n2 \nE 300 0071 27-634 12 detainee contact to only those who have been screened for COVID-19 risk factors.

Plaintiffs offer no evidence that those who are detained will fare any \n23 better in avoiding COVID-19 if they do not participate in the housekeeping policy.11 \n24 To  the  contrary,  CDC  guidance  makes  clear  that  “routine  cleaning  of  frequently \n25 touched surfaces,” such as the housekeeping tasks performed by detainees, help to \n                                           \n26\n11 The only citation related to cleanliness within ICE detention centers, as it relates to COVID-19, \n27 cited the inability of a facility to “keep the detention facilities sufficiently clean to combat the spread \nof the virus.” ECF 252-1 at n. 78.

Indeed it \n2 is an external force that no one, neither this Court, nor GEO can control.

See ECF 252-1, 22 \n5 (citing US v. Dann, 652 F.3d 1160, 1170 (9th Cir. 2011)). Rather, any TVPA claim is \n6 limited to the threats, that if proven, would allegedly be within GEO’s control, as \n7 enumerated  by  Plaintiffs  in  their  brief  as  the  threats  of  solitary  confinement, \n8 disciplinary housing transfers, loss of privileges, and criminal prosecution—none of \n9 which are alleged to occur during the current COVID-19 crisis.

But the detainees would have no responsibility for \n4 cleaning those same areas. Thus, halting the housekeeping policies would not only fail \n5 to make headway in preventing the spread of COVID-19, it would be antithetical to \n6 the CDC’s recommendations for preventing the spread. The CDC has recommended \n7 that all individuals practice “routine cleaning of frequently touched surfaces” within \n8 their homes, including tables, desks, toilets, faucets, sinks, and handles—as may be \n9 cleaned in the housekeeping program.15 The CDC does not explicitly recommend that \n10 individuals  have  others  clean  up  after  them  and  instead  suggests  that  those  who \n11 cohabitate should be cognizant of keeping high touch surfaces clean.16 Thus, Plaintiffs \n2 \nE 300 0071 27-634 12 proposed relief would not meaningfully reduce the spread of COVID-19, and in fact \nRMAN LLP  TH STREET, SUITS, CALIFORNIA 9500 – FAX: (213) 6 111345 w imopulledm Obeenn  itnt hicteos  norsitighsoeterr nohtu aswn iCdth,O  tiVfh eIPD clal-e1ina9rt i rfgefussi’pd oaTnnRsceOe   fprdloaomne s it nhnceol uCt dDeinnCtge.  r i,m GpEleOm ewnitliln gc otnhtei nsuoec itaol  \nE FE9\nAK T FIGEL688- 16 distancing procedures, enhanced cleaning procedures, and informational campaigns as \n601 WESLOS ANEL.: (213)  17 described in Section II supra and the declarations attached to this response.

Here, the best methods for preventing spread of COVID-\n21 19 have been created by top officials within the federal government which have been \n22 implemented by GEO. Exs. 1, 2, 3, and 4 (explaining that GEO’s guidance has been \n23 created based upon CDC recommendations and those from ICE). These measures \n24 include ensuring adequate stocks of hygiene and cleaning supplies, informing detained \n25 individuals about the importance of personal hygiene, and “routinely cleaning and \n26 disinfecting  surfaces  and  objects  that  are  frequently  touched.”17  None  of  the \n27                                            \n17 Centers of Disease Control, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-\n28\ndetention/faq.html \n52631576;4  16  CASE NO. 5:17-CV-02514-JGB-SHKX \nDEFENDANT THE GEO GROUP, INC.'S OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' EX PARTE \nAPPLICATION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 255   Filed 04/08/20   Page 23 of 29   Page ID\n #:5265\n \n1 information submitted by Plaintiffs runs contrary to this guidance. Rather, Plaintiffs \n2 submit extensive information from the CDC in support of their motion— conceding it \n3 is the proper authority to provide policies for a COVID-19 response. ECF 252-1. Yet \n4 Plaintiffs seek to eliminate one of the many measures GEO is taking in accordance \n5 with CDC guidance. Exs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, supra note 18. Because Plaintiffs’ request for a \n6 TRO would run directly contrary to the guidance from professional health officials, \n7 the public interest weighs against issuance of a TRO.  \n8 ii.  The Provision of Class-Wide Testing and Personal Protective \n9 Equipment (PPE) is Contrary to the Public Interest.  \n10 As part of the relief sought, Plaintiffs ask this Court to order GEO to test all \n11 members of the certified class in this case. ECF 252-1, 7.18 The certified class includes \n2 \nE 300 0071 27-634 12 a large number of individuals who are not detained (including the named Plaintiffs) a \nRMAN LLP  TH STREET, SUITS, CALIFORNIA 9500 – FAX: (213) 6 111345 s(aiilnmsocil lucadlraliysns g l maPrelgamein bnteiufrfsm .K bEaeCrri Fmo f2  i5ni2n S-d1oiv,m i7da.u lIiaanl) s,t  hawen hdao lta elarlr neian tdniviove i,dl oPunlaaglisen rct iufwfrsrite hsneitnely k t hdweee taeUiknnlyei tdte edws thiSnotga at eoresf   \nE FE9\nAK T FIGEL688- 16 all class members who are currently detained.19 ECF 252-2 4. Thus, Plaintiffs seek \n601 WESLOS ANEL.: (213)  17 relief  for  not  only  those  individuals  who  are  subject  to  the current  housekeeping \nT\n18 policies, but also for those individuals detained throughout the United States. There \n19 can be no question that the class members include individuals spread across the world. \n20 Plaintiffs seek this relief at the expense of the needs of the public. Across the United \n21 States the inability to obtain access to COVID-19 testing has hampered patient care.20 \n                                           \n22\n18 GEO notes that in their proposed order, Plaintiffs seek weekly testing of all class members who \n23 participate in general housekeeping tasks. ECF 252-2. It is unclear which form of relief Plaintiffs are \nseeking due to these inconsistent representations. Nevertheless, this section applies equally to either \n24\nform of testing.  \n19 All detainees are responsible for cleaning up after themselves as required by ICE’s PBNDS and \n25\ntherefore every detainee would be eligible for testing under Plaintiffs’ proposed relief.  \n26 20 Sheila Kaplan, Despite Promises, Testing Delays Leave Americans ‘Flying Blind’, available at \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/health/coronavirus-testing-us.html  (last  accessed  April  7, \n27 2020) (“Doctors and officials around the country say that lengthy delays in getting results have \npersisted and that continued uneven access to tests has prolonged rationing and hampered patient \n28\ncare.”). \n52631576;4  17  CASE NO. 5:17-CV-02514-JGB-SHKX \nDEFENDANT THE GEO GROUP, INC.'S OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' EX PARTE \nAPPLICATION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 255   Filed 04/08/20   Page 24 of 29   Page ID\n #:5266\n \n1 To that end, the CDC has made clear, “[n]ot everyone needs to be tested for COVID-\n2 19.”21 Those who seek testing are advised that “[w]hile supplies of these tests are \n3 increasing, it may still be difficult to find a place to get tested.”22 In fact, the Office of \n4 the Inspector General recently investigated the challenges that hospitals are facing in \n5 addressing the current COVID-19 pandemic. Chief among the challenges cited by the \n6 Inspector General was “that severe shortages of testing supplies and extended waits \n7 for test results limited hospitals’ ability to monitor the health of patients and staff.”23 \n8 Thus, reducing the supply of this already limited resource, without a clear justification \n9 for doing so (including by following the qualifications delineated by the CDC), would \n10 be a detriment to the public who would face additional shortages in order to test \n11 detainees  who  are  not  presenting  symptoms  and  do  not  meet  CDC  or  medical \n2 \nE 300 0071 27-634 12 guidelines for testing (presuming GEO could even obtain a sufficient number of tests \nRMAN LLP  TH STREET, SUITS, CALIFORNIA 9500 – FAX: (213) 6 111345 tGoe snaetrisaLfly ik Rtehweep irsoeerq,t  uPemPstaEsd  heie sr ceilinen a).lr i  mthitaetd  “swupidpelysp raecardo sss htohret angaetsi ono.f  Tpheer sosanmale  pIrnostpeecctitvoer  \nE FE9\nAK T FIGEL688- 16 equipment (PPE) put staff and patients at risk.”24 The shortages are well known to the \n601 WESLOS ANEL.: (213)  17 CDC, which advises that “PPE shortages are currently posing a tremendous challenge \nT\n18 to the US healthcare system because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare facilities \n19 are having difficulty accessing the needed PPE and are having to identify alternate \n20 ways to provide patient care.”25 To that end, the CDC provides stringent guidance for \n21\n                                           \n22 21  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  prevention,  Testing  for  COVID_-9,  available  at \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/testing.html  (last  accessed  April  7, \n23 2020). \n22 Id. \n24\n23 Office of the Inspector General, Hospital Experiences Responding to the COVID-19 Pandemic: \nResults  of  a  National  Pulse  Survey  March  23-27,  2020,  available  at \n25\nhttps://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-06-20-\n26 00300.asp?utm_source=web&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=covid-19-hospital-survey-04-06-\n2020 (last visited April 7, 2020). \n27 24 Id. \n25Centers  for  Disease  Control,  Strategies  to  Optimize  the  Supply  of  PPE  and  Equipment, \n28\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/index.html (last visited April 7, 2020).  \n52631576;4  18  CASE NO. 5:17-CV-02514-JGB-SHKX \nDEFENDANT THE GEO GROUP, INC.'S OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' EX PARTE \nAPPLICATION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 255   Filed 04/08/20   Page 25 of 29   Page ID\n #:5267\n \n1 the use of PPE, focused on ensuring medical professionals have what they need and \n2 discouraging use by those who are not infected or who do not need it.26 Thus, like \n3 with testing, drawing from the currently limited supply of PPE and taking from the \n4 hospitals that need it as a merely precautionary measure would be to the detriment of \n5 the general public. Accordingly, to provide this relief to Plaintiffs would be counter to \n6 the public interest.  \n7 iii.  A Nationwide Injunction is Against the Public Interest to Have \n8 Issues Presented to District Courts Nationwide.  \n9 Justice  Thomas  made  clear  that  the  authority  of  a  district  court  to  enter  a \n10 nationwide injunction is tenuous at best.

Sebelius, 638 F.3d 644, 664 (9th Cir. 2011) And, the balance of courts \n19 agree that “nationwide injunctive relief is discouraged where it would ‘substantially \n20 thwart the development of important questions of law’ and prevent other courts from \n21 ruling on the validity of the regulation. See e.g., United States v. Mendoza, 464 U.S. \n22 154, 160, 104 S.Ct. 568, 78 L.Ed.2d 379 (1984); see also Virginia Society for Human \n23 Life, Inc. v. Federal Election Commission, 263 F.3d 379, 393 (4th Cir. 2001).  \n24 Here, there can be no question that the TVPA claims brought by Plaintiffs raise \n25 novel and complex issues of law. These issues should not be resolved, nationwide, \n26 where other Courts are grappling with similar issues. Indeed, the district court in \n27\n                                           \n28\n26 Id. \n52631576;4  19  CASE NO. 5:17-CV-02514-JGB-SHKX \nDEFENDANT THE GEO GROUP, INC.'S OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' EX PARTE \nAPPLICATION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 255   Filed 04/08/20   Page 26 of 29   Page ID\n #:5268\n \n1 Barrientos has this exact issue, the application of the TVPA to detention facilities that \n2 implement  discipline  consistent  with  the  PBNDS,  pending  before  it.  See  e.g. \n3 Barrientos v. CoreCivic, M.D. Ga. Case No. 4:18-cv-00070-CDL, 2018 WL 1836209 \n4 (M.D.Ga.). Likewise, the Southern District of California is grappling with the same \n5 issue. See Owino v. CoreCivic, S. D. Cal. Case No. 3:17-cv01112-JLS-NLS. While \n6 these are a few examples, many courts across the country are dealing with the same \n7 issue. See e.g., Menocal v. GEO, D. Colo. Case No. 1:14-cv-02887. Some of these \n8 cases have been pending for years and extensive discovery has occurred. These cases \n9 should not be superseded by a TRO in this case which would impact facilities in most \n10 federal appellate circuits. This is particularly true where Plaintiffs have provided scant \n11 evidence to support their motion, relying upon recycled declarations from other cases, \n2 \nE 300 0071 27-634 12 and  addressing  only  two  (2)  of  the  twelve  (12)  facilities  for  which  they  seek  an \nRMAN LLP  TH STREET, SUITS, CALIFORNIA 9500 – FAX: (213) 6 111345 iannjdu npcrtoAivodindd.i etT igohuneia dlTalynV,c PecA too ui strhstsuo seaes  casrdhodossrue lsdtsh iben eg n atahlltioiso wnneo dva ertelo  i smgsruoaevp. ep  litnhrgo uwghit ht heth ed isatrpipcrt ocporuiarttes  \nE FE9\nAK T FIGEL688- 16 response to COVID-19 in detention settings. This is evident through Plaintiffs’ own \n601 WESLOS ANEL.: (213)  17 submissions which consist largely of declarations that are pending before other district \nT\n18 courts  across  the  country.  There  are  countless  other  motions  across  the  country \n19 seeking release from custody or other changes in policy at ICE facilities as a result of \n20 COVID-19. See e.g. Fabiola-Almeida v. Barr, 20-cv-490-RSM-BAT, Dkt. No. 11 \n21 (W.D. Wash. Apr. 6, 2020). Courts have reached varied results, including the astute \n22 analysis  from  the  Chief  United  States  District  Judge  for  the  Western  District  of \n23 Washington. Judge Martinez’s recent order is instructive here: \n24\n“[T]he  court  cannot  conclude  either  that  the  spread  of  COVID-19 \n25 inside NWDC is inevitable, or that the Attorney General will be unable \nto contain it if it occurs. No one can entirely guarantee safety in the \n26\nmidst of a global pandemic. However, the standard under which the \n27 court evaluates [Plaintiff’s] TRO motion is not guaranteed safety—an \nimpossible standard to meet no matter the circumstances—but rather a \n28\n52631576;4  20  CASE NO. 5:17-CV-02514-JGB-SHKX \nDEFENDANT THE GEO GROUP, INC.'S OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' EX PARTE \nAPPLICATION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 255   Filed 04/08/20   Page 27 of 29   Page ID\n #:5269\n \nlikelihood of irreparable harm. The evidence before the court does not \n1\nmeet that standard.” \n2\nPatel v. Barr, 20-cv-488-RSM-BAT, Dkt. No. 9 (W.D. Wash. April 2, 2020); but see \n3\nBasank v. Decker, 2020 WL 1481503 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2020) (granting a TRO in \n4\nconnection with a writ of habeas corpus on the basis that Plaintiffs had established \n5\nlikely due process violations). The differing decisions in each judicial district provide \n6\nfor additional considerations for future courts addressing similar issues. This judicial \n7\nmarketplace of ideas is helpful to all other judges who are sure to face similar issues in \n8\nthe coming months. Thus, should the Court conclude injunctive relief is permissible \n9\nhere, which it should not, it should enter relief only as to those facilities for which \n10\nPlaintiffs have submitted evidence: LIPC and Aurora. Under no circumstances would \n11\na broader injunction be appropriate in this case.  \n2 \nE 300 0071 27-634 12 IV.

Here,  should  the  Court  issue \n22\ninjunctive relief, which it should not, Plaintiffs should be required to pay a bond \n23\nconsistent with the Rule. “The district court may dispense with the filing of a bond \n24\nwhen  it  concludes  there  is  no  realistic  likelihood  of  harm  to  the  defendant  from \n25\nenjoining  his  or  her  conduct.”  Jorgensen  v.  Cassiday,  320  F.3d  906,  919(9th \n26\nCir.2003).  Here,  Plaintiffs  cannot  establish  that  there is no  likelihood  of  harm  in \n27\nenjoining GEO’s conduct.

Additionally, there can be no question that Plaintiffs have not provided \n3 any precedential authority that would indicate that if a TRO were to issue, it would be \n4 likely that the TRO would not later be reversed. Nor have they provided a sufficient \n5 showing  on  the  merits  to  justify  confidence  that  any  TRO  would  not  be  quickly \n6 reversed. For these reasons, Plaintiffs should be required to submit a bond, the amount \n7 of which, would be set by this Court. Johnson v. Couturier, 572 F.3d 1067, 1086 (9th \n8 Cir. 2009). At a minimum, this bond should include GEO’s “potential defense costs, \n9 an  offer  which  if  accepted  would  itself ensure that  Defendants’  expenses  will  be \n10 reimbursed” if injunctive relief is reversed.

That is to say, the Court could enjoin GEO from \n19 enforcing certain types of punishments for detainees who refuse to clean their living \n20 areas during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, even if the Court were to order \n21 temporary relief under the TVPA, GEO would still be able to request that detainees \n22 clean  their  areas  more  frequently  (absent  any  punishment  or  coercion)  and  could \n23 emphasize the  importance of  cleanliness  during the  current  COVID-19 pandemic. \n24 Further, there can be no doubt that the TVPA does not provide for the provision of \n25 PPE as a remedy for a violation of the TVPA.  \n26 Additionally, to the extent Plaintiffs’ proposed order seeks to have this Court \n27 take judicial notice of the facts and findings in Hernandez v. Wolf, No. 5:20-cv-00617-\n28 TJH, this relief should not be granted.

GEO’s counterclaims fail to state a claim upon which relief can be  \ngranted. \n6 \n \n2.  The relief GEO seeks is barred by the doctrine of estoppel \n7 \n8 \n3.

The relief GEO seeks is barred by the doctrine of waiver. \n13 \n7.  GEO has failed to joined an indispensable party.  \n14 \n8.  The relief GEO seeks is barred by the statute of limitations. \n15 \n16  9.

The relief GEO seeks should be limited by the corporation’s failure to  \n20  mitigate its damages.  \n \n21 \nPLAINTIFF’S COUNTERCLAIM IN REPLY \n22 \n   Pursuant  to  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  13(a),  Plaintiff  Novoa,  on  behalf  of  himself \n23 \n24  individually and all others similarly situated, brings the following counterclaim in reply \n25 \nagainst GEO for retaliation. In this regard, and since the underlying First Amended Class \n26  6  \n           5:17-cv-02514-JGB \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n\n \nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 50   Filed 07/24/18   Page 7 of 14   Page ID #:502\n \n \n1  Action Complaint (ECF No. 47) alleges five causes of action, the new cause of action \n2 \nset forth herein will start the sixth cause of action. \n3 \nJURISDICTION \n4 \n5  1.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 \n6 \nbecause this action arises under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ \n7 \n1589 et seq. \n8 \n2.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the Class Action \n9 \n10 \nFairness Act of 2005, 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d), because at least one class member is of diverse \n11 \ncitizenship from one defendant; there are more than 100 class members; the aggregate \n12 \namount in controversy exceeds $5,000,000; and minimal diversity exists. \n13 \n14  3.  Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) because the \n15 \nevents or omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in this District. \n16 \n4.  This Court has personal jurisdiction over GEO because the corporation \n17 \n18  regularly conducts business in California, and has sufficient minimum contacts with \n19 \nCalifornia.    \n20 \n5.  Plaintiff  requests  that  this  Court  exercise  supplemental  jurisdiction \n21 \n22  pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367 over his state law claims. \n23 \n \n24 \n  \n25 \n26  7  \n           5:17-cv-02514-JGB \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n\n \nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 50   Filed 07/24/18   Page 8 of 14   Page ID #:503\n \n \n1  PARTIES \n2 \n6.  Plaintiff Raul Novoa is an adult resident of Los Angeles, California. He is \n3 \na lawful permanent resident with longstanding family and community ties in the Los \n4 \n5  Angeles area.  From 2012 through February 2015, Mr. Novoa was detained at the \n6 \nAdelanto Facility.  During those three years, he was employed by GEO as a janitor and \n7 \na barber. He was paid only $1 per day for his labor, regardless of how many hours he \n8 \nworked.   \n9 \n10 \n7.  Defendant  GEO  is  a  for-profit  corporation  providing  correctional, \n11 \ndetention, and community reentry services. GEO is a Florida corporation, with its \n12 \nprincipal office located at 624 NW 53rd Street, Suite 700, Boca Raton, Florida 33487.  \n13 \n14  COUNT VI \nRetaliation  \n15 \n \n16  8.  GEO’s  counterclaims for “unjust enrichment/offset” and “declaratory \n17 \nrelief” are a retaliatory in terrorem tactic against Plaintiff Novoa and the class members \n18 \nfor bringing their claims to court.  \n19 \n20  9.  Plaintiff Raul Novoa was detained at the Adelanto Facility from June 2012 \n21 \nthrough February 2015.  \n22 \n10.  On December 19, 2017, Plaintiff Novoa, on behalf of himself and all \n23 \n24  others similarly situated, filed a class action complaint seeking money damages and \n25 \ninjunctive relief from GEO for the continued and unlawful  economic exploitation of \n26  8  \n           5:17-cv-02514-JGB \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n\n \nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 50   Filed 07/24/18   Page 9 of 14   Page ID #:504\n \n \n1  civil immigration detainees at the Adelanto Detention Center (the “Adelanto Facility”) \n2 \n(ECF No. 1). By filing this lawsuit, Plaintiff Novoa engaged in a protected activity. \n3 \n11.  On July 3, 2018, GEO filed a counterclaim against Plaintiff Novoa and all \n4 \n5  putative class members for “unjust enrichment/offset” and “declaratory relief.”     \n6 \n12.  Accordingly, GEO waited more than three years after Plaintiff Novoa was \n7 \nreleased from the Adelanto Facility, and only after this Court denied in part GEO’s \n8 \nmotion to dismiss, to file its counterclaims.  \n9 \n10  13.  GEO’s  motive  in  bringing  these  counterclaims  is  to  retaliate  against \n11 \nPlaintiff Novoa and deter the class members – thousands of vulnerable and indigent \n12 \nindividuals – from exercising their protected right to litigate their claims against GEO.  \n13 \n14  14.  GEO’s  counterclaim  targets  the  entire  putative  class  –  i.e.,  “All  civil \n15 \nimmigration detainees who performed work for GEO at the Adelanto Detention Center \n16 \nin the Work Program since GEO assumed responsibility for the Facility in May 2011.”  \n17 \n18  15.  GEO has a strong financial interest in deterring Plaintiff Novoa and the \n19 \nputative class members from prosecuting their case.  \n20 \n16.  GEO represented to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth \n21 \n22  Circuit that a similar federal class action lawsuit currently pending Colorado “poses a \n23 \npotentially catastrophic risk to GEO’s ability to honor its contracts with the federal \n24 \n25 \n26  9  \n           5:17-cv-02514-JGB \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n\n \nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 50   Filed 07/24/18   Page 10 of 14   Page ID #:505\n \n \n1  government.”  Petition for Permission to Appeal Class Certification at 30, Menocal et. al. \n2 \nv. The GEO Group, Inc., No.14-02887 (10th Cir.  March 13, 2017). \n3 \n17.  GEO’s decision to seek equitable relief from Plaintiff Novoa and the \n4 \n5  putative class now, on the eve of discovery, is evidence of GEO’s retaliatory intent.  \n6 \n18.  In addition, GEO’s counterclaims are wholly without merit.  \n7 \n19.  First, GEO’s counterclaim for “unjust enrichment/offset” is time-barred \n8 \nbecause it was filed more than three years after Plaintiff Novoa was released from the \n9 \n10 \nAdelanto Facility.  \n11 \n20.  Second,  Plaintiff  Novoa  and  the  class  members  were  not  “unjustly \n12 \nenriched” at the expense of GEO, because GEO is contractually required to provide for \n13 \n14  all essential detention services at the Adelanto Facility.  These essential detention services \n15 \ninclude providing detainees with food, shelter, utilities, clothing, bedding, recreation, \n16 \nentertainment, and medical, dental, optical, and mental health services – the exact same \n17 \n18  services for which GEO now demands restitution from thousands of current and former \n19 \ndetainees. GEO – a multibillion-dollar corporation – has made tens of millions of dollars \n20 \nin profits from its contract to run the Adelanto Facility.   \n21 \n22  21.  Third,  an  involuntary  detainee  cannot  simply  refuse  detention  (i.e. \n23 \n“housing”) or the conditions of confinement (i.e. food and utilities). Plaintiff Novoa and \n24 \nthe class members had no choice but to accept the “goods and services” provided by \n25 \n26  1 0 \n           5:17-cv-02514-JGB \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n\n \nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 50   Filed 07/24/18   Page 11 of 14   Page ID #:506\n \n \n1  GEO, pursuant to GEO’s contract with the City of Adelanto to operate the Adelanto \n2 \nFacility.   \n3 \n22.  GEO’s counterclaims are reasonably likely to deter the protected activity \n4 \n5  of filing and prosecuting a lawsuit.     \n6 \n23.  Plaintiff Novoa’s counterclaim in reply of retaliation arises out of the same \n7 \ntransaction or occurrence and the same set of aggregate facts that are the subject matter \n8 \nof GEO’s counterclaims.  \n9 \n10  24.  Plaintiff Novoa’s counterclaim in reply does not require adding another \n11 \nparty over whom the Court cannot acquire jurisdiction. \n12 \n25.  GEO  – a multibillion dollar real estate investment trust that rakes in \n13 \n14  hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars in revenue each quarter – is seeking to shift the \n15 \ncosts of its compliance its contract and all governing federal, state, and local laws onto \n16 \nPlaintiff Novoa and the putative class, and to strike fear in the hearts of other vulnerable \n17 \n18  human beings that the company incarcerates for profit. \n19 \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n20 \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiff  Novoa,  individually  and  on  behalf  of  the  Class, \n21 \n22  requests that the Court:    \n23 \na.  Issue an Order enjoining GEO from continuing to retaliate against \n24  Plaintiff Novoa and the putative class members;  \n \n25 \n26  1 1 \n           5:17-cv-02514-JGB \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n\n \nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 50   Filed 07/24/18   Page 12 of 14   Page ID #:507\n \n \n1  b.

No. 252), \nand Plaintiffs’ motion for expedited discovery, (“Motion,” Dkt. No. 254).  The Court held a \ntelephonic hearing on these matters on April 16, 2020.  After considering the papers filed in \nsupport of, and in opposition to, the matters, and the oral argument of the parties the Court \nDENIES the Application and DENIES the Motion. \n \nI.  BACKGROUND \nA. Procedural Background \n \nOn December 19, 2017, Raul Novoa (“Novoa”) filed a putative class action complaint \nagainst Defendant The GEO Group, Inc. (“GEO”).  (Dkt. No. 1.)  Novoa filed a first amended \ncomplaint,  (Dkt. No. 47), and a second amended complaint, which added Jaime Campos Fuentes \n(“Fuentes”) as a Plaintiff, (Dkt. No. 108).  Plaintiffs then filed a third amended complaint, which \nis operative, (“TAC,” Dkt. No. 184).  The TAC added Abdiaziz Karim (“Karim”) and Ramon \nMancia (“Mancia”) as Plaintiffs, amended the class definitions, and added two causes of action.  \n(see Dkt. No. 183 at 2.) \n \nPage 1 of 13  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk iv   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 268   Filed 04/22/20   Page 2 of 13   Page ID #:5939\nThe TAC alleges seven causes of action arising from Plaintiffs’ detention at California’s \nAdelanto Detention Center (“Adelanto”): (1) violation of California’s Minimum Wage Law, Cal. \nLabor Code §§ 1194, 1197, 1197.1; (2) unjust enrichment; (3) violation of California’s Unfair \nCompetition Law, Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 17200, et seq.; (4) violation of California’s \nTrafficking Victims Protection Act (“CTVPA”), Cal. Civ. Code § 52.5; (5) forced labor under \nthe Federal Trafficking Victims Protection Act (“TVPA”), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1589(a), 1594(a); (6) \nforced and attempted forced labor under the TVPA; and (7) retaliation.  The TAC defines three \nputative classes and one subclass. \n \n  On November 26, 2019, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, and \ncertified the three classes.  (“Class Certification Order,” Dkt. No.  223; see also Dkt. No. 229 \n(separate order).)  As relevant to the Application, the Court certified a national Housing Unit \nSanitation Policy (“HUSP”) Class, as follows: \n \nAll civilly detained immigrants who (i) were detained at any civil immigration \ndetention center owned or operated by GEO in the United States between \nDecember 19, 2007 and the date of final judgment in this matter, and (ii) were \nsubject to a GEO Housing Unit Sanitation Policy (HUSP) at any point during \ntheir detention. \n \nExcluded from the definition of the Nationwide HUSP Class are the following: (1) \nindividuals detained in GEO’s family residential detention facility in Karnes City, \nTexas; (2) individuals detained in the Alexandria Staging Facility in Alexandria, \nLouisiana; (3) any individual detained in the custody of the U.S. Marshal or any \nother law enforcement agency at a GEO facility where the company also detains \ncivil immigration detainees pursuant to contracts with ICE; and (4) civilly \ndetained immigrants detainees held at the Aurora ICE Processing Center in \nAurora, Colorado at any time before October 22, 2014 \n \n(Id.)  The Nationwide HUSP class was certified under Federal R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  The only \nclaim relevant to the Nationwide HUSP class the fifth claim for relief, which arises under the \nTVPA.  (TAC ¶¶ 231-243.)  The Court also certified two other classes, which are not relevant to \nthe Application.  (Class Cert. Order.) \n \nPlaintiffs filed the Application on April 6, 2020.  (App.)  In support of the Application, \nthey filed the Declaration of Daniel H. Charest, (“Charest Declaration,” Dkt. No. 253 (attaching \nfurther declarations as Exhibits A to D).)  Plaintiffs concurrently filed the Motion, (Mot.), and \nincluded in support proposed interrogatories and requests for admission, (Mot., Ex. A.), and a \nproposed Rule 30(b)(6) deposition, (Mot. Ex. B). \n \nDefendant opposed the Application on April 8, 2020, (“Application Opposition,” Dkt. \nNo. 255), and included in support the Declaration of David Van Pelt, (“Van Pelt Declaration,” \nDkt. No. 256 (attaching further declarations as Exhibits 1 to 5).)  Defendant opposed the Motion \non the same day, (“Motion Opposition,” Dkt. No. 258).  On April 12, 2020, Plaintiffs filed a \nPage 2 of 13  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk iv   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 268   Filed 04/22/20   Page 3 of 13   Page ID #:5940\nreply, (“Reply,” Dkt. No. 259), along with a supplemental declaration and exhibits from Daniel \nH. Charest, (“Charest Declaration II,” Dkt. No. 260 (attaching further declarations as Exhibits \nA to AA).)  Defendant in turn filed supplemental declarations on April 13, 2020.  (“Staiger \nDeclaration,” Dkt. No. 262-1 (attaching Exhibits A to B).)   \n \nOn December 17, 2020, the parties filed supplemental briefs and supporting exhibits.  \n(“Plaintiffs’ Supplement,” Dkt. No 264 (attaching Exhibits A to C); “Defendants’ \nSupplement,” Dkt. Nos. 256, 258; “Van Pelt Declaration II,” Dkt. No. 266 (attaching Exhibits A \nto E).) \n \nB.  Factual Background \n \n1.  The Parties \n \nThis class action is brought by current and former immigration detainees against the \noperator of an immigration detention facility located in the City of Adelanto, California \n(“Adelanto”).  Plaintiffs were held at Adelanto while their immigration cases were pending.  \nGEO is a business that operates more than a dozen immigration detention centers around the \ncountry.  The HUSP class members (“Class Members”)  include civil immigration detainees \ncurrently held at GEO facilities nationwide, with the exceptions noted in the class definition. \n \nGEO is required to comply with ICE’s Performance Based National Detention Standards, \n(“PBNDS”) which set out “expected outcomes” and “minimum requirements” for the \nmanagement of contract facilities like Adelanto.  These outcomes and requirements touch on \nnearly all aspects of operating an immigration detention facility, including arrangements for \ndetainee labor within the facility.  GEO has either companywide or facility-specific policies that \nmust meet or exceed the minimum standards in the PBNDS, and which apply across the \ncompany or facility.  \n \nPlaintiffs describe a GEO company-wide practice of Housing Unit Sanitation Policies \n(“HUSPs”) that apply at GEO immigration detention centers nationwide.  Class Members \ncontend these HUSPs impermissibly expand the scope of “required personal housekeeping” \notherwise permissible under the PBNDS.  They contend that GEO compels them to clean \ncommon areas under the threat of disciplinary confinement, criminal prosecution, or threat of \nother harm. \n \n2.  COVID-19 and Housing Unit Sanitation Policies \n \nCOVID-19 is a disease caused by a novel coronavirus, and it reached pandemic status in \nMarch 2020, approximately four months after the Court certified that Nationwide HUSP class.  \nAt time of this Order, the United States has more known COVID-19 cases than any other country \nin the world, and more than 35,000 people have died from the disease in this country alone.  \nMany tens of thousands of deaths are expected in the coming weeks.   \n \nPage 3 of 13  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk iv   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 268   Filed 04/22/20   Page 4 of 13   Page ID #:5941\nCOVID-19 is highly contagious, and there is no known cure.  It can spread through \nrespiratory droplets and high-touch surfaces, and is especially likely to spread quickly in \ncongregate settings such as detention centers.  (App. at 7.)  One effective way to prevent the \nspread of the disease is physical separation from others, because even asymptomatic carriers of \nthe disease can infect others.  (App. at 2-4.)  Beyond that, the best prevention is aggressive \nhygiene (use of hand sanitizer and frequent hand washing), and if available, the use of personal \nprotective equipment (“PPE”), including gloves, eye and face shields, and masks when in public \nspaces.  (Id.) \n \nClass Members argue that the GEO’s HUSPs expose them to unsanitary spaces and \nsurfaces such as floors, showers, and toilets, and to possible COVID-19 infection.  (App. at 5.)  \nThey assert that GEO does not provide detainees with PPE to prevent the spread of disease.  (Id. \nat 6.)  GEO requires all detainees to participate in mandatory general cleanups of their housing \nunits, every day, and every week subjects the units to a more rigorous “total sanitation” mission.  \n(Id.)  GEO’s detainee handbook classifies refusal to clean assigned living areas as an offense \npunishable by disciplinary segregation or even criminal prosecution, or by suspension of \nprograms and recreation.  (Id.)   \n \nAll Class Members are subject to the HUSP.  (Id. at 6-8.)  Class Members contend that \nthe HUSPs are particularly unreasonable at this time, because people with serious underlying \nmedical conditions or old age are more likely to die from COVID-19.  (Id. at 8-9.)  Eighty percent \nof all COVID-19 deaths in the United States have been among adults 65 years of age or older.  (Id. \nat 9.)  And, COVID-19 poses severe risks even to those not in a medically vulnerable population.  \n(Id. at 10.) \n \n3.  Conditions of Confinement at GEO Facilities \n \nThe Class Members are or were confined at twelve GEO facilities operated as ICE \nProcessing or Transitional Centers nationwide: Adelanto, Aurora, Broward, Folkston, Joe \nCorley, LaSalle, Mesa Verde, Montgomery, Northwest, Pine Prairie, South Louisiana, and South \nTexas.  (Pls.’ Supp. at 2 n.5.)  As of the writing of this Order, ICE reports positive cases at three \nof the twelve facilities.  See ICE Guidance on Coronavirus,  https://www.ice.gov/coronavirus.  \n \nIt appears that the HUSPs continue to apply, and that Plaintiffs’ cleaning duties have \nbeen intensified.  The extent to which detainees on work duty have access to different PPE \n(gloves, masks, etc.) is disputed, and appears to be changing.   \n \nFor example, in support of their initial briefs, Plaintiffs attach declarations from GEO \ndetainees or their attorneys, which do not state outright but suggest that the HUSPs continue to \nbe enforced during the pandemic.   (Charest Decl., Exs. A to D.)  Defendant counters with the \ndeclarations of several facility administrators, which neither acknowledge nor deny the existence \nof HUSPs.  (Van Pelt Decl., Exs. 1- 5).  Defendant’s declarations suggest gloves are available for \ncleaning but do not explicitly state that detainees, as distinct from GEO staff, have been able to \nwear gloves when completing sanitation tasks.  At Adelanto ICE Processing Center in California, \nPage 4 of 13  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk iv   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 268   Filed 04/22/20   Page 5 of 13   Page ID #:5942\nGEO has implemented “intensified cleaning” and GEO “has gloves for use with cleaning.”  (Id., \nEx. 1 ¶ 16.)  The same is true at Aurora ICE Processing Center in Colorado, where cleanings \noccur “throughout the day multiple times,” (id., Ex. 2 ¶ 17), LaSalle ICE Processing Center in \nLouisiana, (id., Ex. 3 ¶ 9), and at the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Washington state, (id., \nEx. 4 ¶ 17).   \n \nIn support of their Reply, Plaintiffs attach declarations addressing somewhat more \ndirectly the cleaning policies at GEO facilities.  For example, the Declaration of Rebecca Merton, \n(“Merton Declaration,” Charest Decl. II, Ex. A), notes that a national nonprofit, Freedom for \nImmigrants has received reports through the National Immigration Detention Hotline that \ndetainees continue to clean within their dorms, pods, or common areas without PPE, (id. ¶¶ 5-10 \n(discussing reports from Adelanto (detainees continue to clean, no soap-based products to clean \nbathrooms, no hand sanitizer),  LaSalle (detainees continue to clean), Northwest (detainees work \nas usual without PPE), Aurora (detainees work but have gloves), South Louisiana (detainees \ncontinue to clean), Mesa Verde (detainees continue to clean, were not allowed to use masks they \nmade from their own clothing)).)  Additional declarations bolster the claim that detainees are still \nrequired to clean and in many cases do not have PPE.  (Charest Decl. II, Ex. G (noting that as of \nearly April 2020, Pine Prairie detainees continue cleaning without access to masks or gloves); id., \nEx. I (noting that as of April 4, 2020 at Adelanto “detainees do all of the cleaning, laundry, and \nkitchen work,” that declarant is currently working in the kitchen, and that declarant has observed \nother detainees cleaning with gloves but no masks); id., Exs. J to J (noting that as of late March \n2020, at Northwest ICE Processing Center, detainees are the ones required to do the cleaning); \nid. Exs. P to R  (noting at Aurora, detainees clean common areas and dorms only once per day, \nwith inadequate supplies, and without gloves, as of April 10, 2020); id. Ex. T (noting at Broward \nTransitional Center dorm cleaning programs continue under threat of punishment and without \nmasks or other PPE); id. Ex. X (noting detainees at Mesa Verde the dorms and phones); id., Ex. \nAA (noting at the Montgomery and Corely facilities in Texas detainees are required to clean and \nsanitize their own living areas).  Defendant’s supplemental declaration on the Pine Prairie facility \nstates that as of April 13, 2020, detainees do have access to gloves while cleaning, and that GEO \nstaff sanitize hard surfaces and high-touch areas multiple times during their shifts.  (Staiger Decl. \n¶ 19 (“[D]etainees are issued these gloves to clean.”).)   \n \n4.  ICE’s Pandemic Response Requirements and CDC Guidelines \n \nOn March 23, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) issued \ninterim guidance on the management of COVID-19 for correctional and detention facilities.1  \n(“CDC Interim Guidance,” Pls.’s Supp., Ex. B (also attached at Van Pelt Decl. II, Ex. C).)  That \nguidance counsels facilities to “[e]nsure that staff and incarcerated/detained persons performing \ncleaning wear recommended PPE,” then directs the reader to a PPE section and table.  (Id. at \n18.)  The PPE section states that “persons who will have contact with infectious materials in \ntheir work placements” should be trained to “don, doff, and dispose of PPE relevant to the level \n \n1 The Court cites to CDC Interim Guidance PDF pages.  The PDF is available at \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/guidancecorrectional-detention.pdf.  \nPage 5 of 13  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk iv   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 268   Filed 04/22/20   Page 6 of 13   Page ID #:5943\nof contact they will have with confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases.”  (Id. at 23.)  For \ndetainees “in work placement cleaning areas where a COVID-19 case has spent some time” the \nCDC’s table for recommended PPE states gloves and a gown/coveralls should be used.  (Id., \nTable 1 at 25.)  The CDC recommends the same PPE for staff cleaning in such areas.  (Id.)  N95 \nrespirators, face masks, and eye protection are not recommended in this context.  (Id.) \n \nAbout two weeks after the CDC Interim Guidance was published, ICE Enforcement and \nRemoval Operations released its COVID-19 pandemic response requirements for all facilities \nhousing ICE detainees.  (“Pandemic Response Requirements,” Van Pelt Decl. II, Ex. A.)  The \nPandemic Response Requirements state that facilities “must . . . [c]omply with the CDC’s \nInterim Guidance.”  (Id. at 5, 6 (requiring compliance for both dedicated and non-dedicated \nfacilities).)  All facilities are required to “[a]dhere to CDC recommendations for cleaning and \ndisinfection during the COVID-19 response.”  (Id. at 9.)  The Pandemic response requirements \nalso incorporate by reference the CDC’s guidance for cleaning and disinfection for community \nfacilities.  (Id. at 9 n.7 (referencing “CDC Community Facilities Guidance”); see also Pls.’ \nSupp., Ex. C.) \n \nThe CDC Community Facilities Guidance comports with the CDC Interim Guidance, in \nthat it calls for gloves and a gown or gown substitute while cleaning spaces where a confirmed or \nsuspected COVID-19 case has been, but does not call for a mask.2   \n \nCDC guidance on the use of masks and face coverings has changed over the course of the \npandemic.  In early April 2020, the CDC recommended the use of cloth face coverings (as \ndistinct from surgical or N95 masks) in “public settings” where social distancing measures are \n“difficult to maintain.”3   In apparent recognition of this new guidance, ICE’s April 10, 2020 \nPandemic Response Requirements state that cloth face coverings “should be worn by detainees \nand staff (when PPE supply is limited) to help slow the spread of COVID-19.”  (Pandemic \nResponse Requirements at 8-9.)  It is not clear whether this is a mandate to use cloth face \ncoverings only where face masks are called for, or whether ICE intends for all facilities to \nmandate detainee use of cloth face masks. \n \n// \n// \n// \n// \n// \n// \n \n2 The CDC Community Facilities Guidance is available at \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/organizations/cleaning-\ndisinfection.html. \n3 CDC, Use of Cloth Face Coverings to Help Slow the Spread of COVID-19, \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-\ncoverings.html. \nPage 6 of 13  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk iv   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 268   Filed 04/22/20   Page 7 of 13   Page ID #:5944\nII. LEGAL STANDARD \n \nA. Temporary Restraining Order \n \nThe purpose of a temporary restraining order is to preserve the status quo and prevent \nirreparable harm until a hearing may be held on the propriety of a preliminary injunction.  See \nReno Air Racing Ass’n, Inc. v. McCord, 452 F.3d 1126, 1131 (9th Cir. 2006).  The standard for \nissuing a temporary restraining order is identical to the standard for issuing a preliminary \ninjunction.  Lockheed Missile & Space Co. v. Hughes Aircraft Co., 887 F. Supp. 1320, 1323 \n(N.D. Cal. 1995); see Stuhlbarg Intern. Sales Co., Inc. v. John D. Brushy and Co., Inc., 240 F.3d \n832, 839 n.7 (9th Cir. 2011). \n \n“A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on \nthe merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the \nbalance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.”  Winter v. \nNatural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  The Ninth Circuit employs the “serious \nquestions” test, which states “‘serious questions going to the merits’ and a balance of hardships \nthat tips sharply towards the plaintiff can support issuance of a preliminary injunction, so long as \nthe plaintiff also shows that there is a likelihood of irreparable injury and that the injunction is in \nthe public interest.”  Alliance for Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1135 (9th Cir. 2011).  \n“A preliminary injunction is an ‘extraordinary and drastic remedy.  It should never be awarded as \nof right.”  Munaf v. Geren, 553 U.S. 674, 690 (2008) (citation omitted).   \n \nB.  Expedited Discovery \n \nUnder the Court’s standing order, all discovery matters are referred to a United States \nMagistrate Judge.  (“Standing Order,” Dkt. No. ¶ 7.)  And under Local Rule 37-3, discovery \nmotions:  \n \n[M]ay be noticed to be heard on the particular judge’s regular Motion Day which \nshall not be shall be not earlier than twenty-one (21) days after the filing of the \nmotion.  Unless the Court in its discretion otherwise allows, no discovery motions \nshall be filed or heard on an ex parte basis, absent a showing of irreparable injury \nor prejudice not attributable to the lack of diligence of the moving party. \n \nL.R. 37-3 (emphasis added). \n \nWhile generally formal discovery may not commence until after parties have conferred as \nrequired by Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(f), expedited discovery may be granted upon a showing of good \ncause.  Am. LegalNet, Inc. v. Davis, 673 F. Supp. 2d 1063, 1066 (C.D. Cal. 2009).  Expedited \ndiscovery may be appropriate when it is needed to prepare for a pending preliminary injunction \nhearing.  Id.  In such circumstances, good cause may be found where “the need for expedited \ndiscovery outweighs the prejudice to the responding party.”  Sas v. Sawabeh Info.

LegalNet, Inc. v. Davis, 673 F. Supp. 2d 1063, 1067 (C.D. \nCal. 2009) (citation omitted). \n \nIII.   DISCUSSION \n \nThe Court finds Plaintiffs have standing to apply for injunctive relief, and that they are \nlikely to succeed on their claim.  The Court does not decide whether the harm to which Plaintiffs \nare exposed is irreparable, because Plaintiffs falter on the public interest prong.  They ignore the \nconsequences of an injunction reallocating scarce PPE to Class Members or requiring GEO to \nhire additional staff to clean common areas.  As a result, a temporary restraining order for \nimmediate relief is not warranted, and the Application fails.  The Court rejects the Motion as \nprocedurally deficient. \n \nA. Standing \n \n“Constitutional standing concerns whether the plaintiff’s personal stake in the lawsuit is \nsufficient to make out a concrete ‘case’ or ‘controversy’ to which the federal judicial power may \nextend under Article III, § 2.”  Pershing Park Villas Homeowners Ass’n v. United Pacific Ins. \nCo., 219 F.3d 895 (9th Cir. 2000).  “[T]he irreducible constitutional minimum of standing” is \ncomprised of three elements: (1) an injury-in-fact; (2) a causal connection between the injury and \nchallenged conduct such that the injury is “fairly traceable” to the challenged action; and (3) it \nmust be “likely,” not merely “speculative” that the injury can be redressed by a favorable \ndecision.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992).  The injury-in-fact must \nbe “concrete and particularized” and “actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.”  Id. \nat 560.  “The party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing these \nelements.”  Id. at 561. \n \nThe harm asserted is concrete, particularized, and can be traced to GEO’s sanitation \npolicies and reliance on detainee labor.  Plaintiffs state that the primary harm which they seek to \navoid by means of a TRO is forced labor, not exposure to COVID-19.  (Reply at 16.)  GEO \nconcedes that housing unit sanitation work has been “intensified” or doubled, and so it is clear \nthat there is a probable harm attributable to Defendant.  The harm is likely caused by GEO, \nbecause were it not for the HUSPs, professional cleaning staff or GEO staff would perform the \nwork instead of the detainees. \n \nSimilarly, there is a “substantial likelihood” the harm of forced labor is redressable by a \nCourt order.  Mayfield v. United States, 599 F.3d 964, 971 (9th Cir. 2010).  An order stating that \nClass Members cannot be used to provide sanitation services in the common areas of the facility \nwould stop the asserted harm.  (See “Proposed Order,” Dkt. No. 252-3.)  GEO’s standing \nargument is really a factual question about whether class members are exposed to a serious risk of \ninfection, and whether the requested relief is practical.  (App. Opp’n at 9.)  These arguments go \nPage 8 of 13  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk iv   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 268   Filed 04/22/20   Page 9 of 13   Page ID #:5946\nmore to irreparability of the asserted harm or perhaps the public interest, not whether it is \nconcrete, particularized, or redressable. \n \nFinally, GEO argues that Plaintiffs lack standing to seek injunctive relief, because none of \nthem are detained.  (App. Opp’n at 6-11.)  However, the Court has already certified a HUSP \nClass for individuals seeking injunctive relief to prevent them from being subjected to GEO’s \npolicies.  The Class includes individuals who are currently detained and who are subjected to the \nsanitation policies, and therefore the Court rejects this argument.  LaDuke v. Nelson, 762 F.2d \n1318, 1325  (9th Cir. 1985) (“[C]ertification will preserve a class’s standing even after the named \nindividual representatives have lost the required personal stake.”).  \n \nB.  Temporary Restraining Order \n \nPlaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their TVPA claim and potentially face an \nirreparable harm if injunctive relief is not granted.  However, Plaintiffs do not make an adequate \nshowing that relief is in the public interest.  \n \n1.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \n \nEnacted as part of the Trafficking and Victims Protection Act of 2000 (“TVPA”), 18 \nU.S.C. § 1589 proscribes a party from “knowingly provid[ing] or obtain[ing] the labor or services \nof a person” through force, physical restraint, serious harm, abuse of law or legal process, threats \nof any of those means, or any combination of those methods.  18 U.S.C. § 1589(a) (also \nprohibiting a party from securing labor “by means of any scheme, plan, or pattern intended to \ncause the person to believe that, if that person did not perform such labor or services, that person \nor another person would suffer serious harm or physical restraint.”)  “Serious harm” is defined \nas “any harm, whether physical or nonphysical, including psychological, financial, or reputational \nharm, that is sufficiently serious, under all the surrounding circumstances, to compel a \nreasonable person of the same background and in the same circumstances to perform or to \ncontinue performing labor or services in order to avoid incurring that harm.”  18 U.S.C. § \n1589(c)(2).  Also liable is a party who “knowingly benefits, financially or by receiving anything of \nvalue, from participation in a venture” involving forced labor.  18 U.S.C. § 1589(b).   \n \nPlaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that GEO violates the TVPA.  \nPlaintiffs contend that GEO has acquired free labor by threatening Class Members, because the \nClass Members must perform uncompensated janitorial and maintenance work in the common \nareas of the facilities or face negative consequences including solitary or disciplinary \nconfinement, housing transfers, loss of privileges, referral to ICE and criminal prosecution.  \n(App. at 17.)  This janitorial labor in common areas is distinct, they argue, from the more limited \n“personal housekeeping tasks” sanctioned by ICE’s PBNDS.  PBNDS Section 5.8.V.C.4  GEO \n \n4  The Section provides:                    (continued . . . ) \n \nPage 9 of 13  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk iv   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 268   Filed 04/22/20   Page 10 of 13   Page ID\n #:5947\ndoes not dispute that it requires class members to clean common areas, and equivocates on \nwhether detainees are given gloves when they perform their sanitation duties under the HUSP.  \nAlthough Plaintiffs’ Application relies heavily on previous submissions about the existence and \nscope of the HUSPs and whether a reasonable person in Class Members’ position would believe \nthey have to participate in the HUSP, the Court is satisfied that there is at least a serious question \nwhether the intensified cleaning regime exceeds the permissible limits of the PBNDS, which \ncertainly does not contemplate several forced sanitation jobs per day. \n \n2.  Irreparable Harm \n \nA plaintiff must demonstrate she is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of a \npreliminary injunction.  See Winter, 555 U.S. at 20.  The Ninth Circuit cautions that \n“[s]peculative injury does not constitute irreparable injury sufficient to warrant granting a \npreliminary injunction.”  Caribbean Marine Servs. v. Baldridge, 844 F.2d 668, 674 (9th Cir. \n1988).  A plaintiff seeking injunctive relief must demonstrate that “remedies available at law, \nsuch as monetary damages, are inadequate to compensate” for the injury.  Herb Reed Enters., \nLLC v. Fla. Entm’t Mgmt., 736 F.3d 1239, 1249 (9th Cir. 2013). \n \nThe harm here is potentially twofold.  Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Plaintiffs claimed \nthey were subjected to an involuntary “total sanitation mission” to clean common areas, just \nonce a week.  (App. at 6.)  Plaintiffs show—and Defendant apparently concedes—that during the \npandemic Class Members are likely to clean common areas daily, if not multiple times a day.  \nSecond, Plaintiffs claim they are exposed to a risk of COVID-19 infection, because they do not \nhave proper PPE.  (Charest Decl. II, Ex. H, Declaration of Carlos Franco-Paredes ¶ 30.)  \nPlaintiffs argue that the second harm is irreparable.  They do not claim that the intensified work \nduty itself is an irreparable harm, and the Court does not consider that question.  (App. at 18-21.) \n \nThe Court finds GEO detainees likely face a high risk of COVID-19 infection, due to the \ninexorable spread of the virus.  Indeed, several GEO facilities have already had confirmed \ndetainee or staff cases.  By extension, detainees with cleaning duties face an increased likelihood \nof infection that flows from their duties. \n \nHowever, Plaintiffs fail to address whether the increased risk of infection due to cleaning \nduties is significant.  It is unclear from Plaintiffs’ filings what level of risk flows from Class \n \nWork assignments are voluntary; however, all detainees are responsible for \npersonal housekeeping.  Detainees are required to maintain their immediate living \nareas in a neat and orderly manner by:                       \n \n1. making their bunk beds daily; \n2. stacking loose papers; \n3. keeping the floor free of debris and dividers free of clutter; and \n4. refraining from hanging/draping clothing, pictures, keepsakes, or other \nobjects from beds, overhead lighting fixtures or other furniture. \nPage 10 of 13  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk iv   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 268   Filed 04/22/20   Page 11 of 13   Page ID\n #:5948\nMembers’ work duties and lack of PPE specifically, rather than the fact of their detention \ngenerally.  In other words, the marginal risk of infection posed by the lack of PPE or by increased \nwork duties is difficult to extricate from the more generalized risk of harm posed by being \ndetained.  For example, the Class Members are likely to be exposed to COVID-19 in multiple \ncontexts within the facility, including while: using telephones and tablets, visiting shared \nbathrooms, breathing the air in poorly ventilated housing units, eating, passing too close to fellow \ndetainees, transiting between facility areas, using the law library, or touching virtually any surface \nwithin the facility.   \n \nPlaintiffs make no attempt to disentangle the degree of risk posed by various activities \nwithin the facility.  Their expert declaration on this subject is too general and focuses on multiple \nfactors increasing COVID-19 exposure risk in detention.  It states vaguely that the risk posed by \ncleaning duties is “significant,” but is not persuasive in light of contrary statements by the CDC.5  \n(Charest Decl. II, Ex. H, “Parades Declaration,” ¶¶ 10-14, 30, Dkt. No. 260-8 (“[D]etainees \nwould be significantly less likely to contract COVID-19 if they were not being forced to risk \nexposure by performing mandatory cleaning duties without access to PPE such as masks, gloves, \nand without reliable testing within the facility.”).)  Ultimately, the Court need not, and does not, \ndecide this difficult issue.  Plaintiffs fail to carry their burden to show the injunctive relief \nrequested is in the public interest.  \n \nC. Balance of the Equities, and Public Interest \n \nTurning to the next factors, Plaintiffs must demonstrate that “the balance of equities tips \nin [their] favor.”  Hernandez v. Sessions, 872 F.3d 976, 995 (9th Cir. 2017) (quoting Winter, 555 \nU.S. at 20.).  When “the impact of an injunction reaches beyond the parties, carrying with it a \npotential for public consequences, the public interest will be relevant to whether the district court \ngrants the preliminary injunction.”  Id.   \n \nPlaintiffs have met their burden on the first element but fail on the second.  First, the \nCourt finds that the balance of equities tips in Plaintiffs’ favor, because their health is at stake.  \nHarris v. Bd. of Supervisors, Los Angeles Cty., 366 F.3d 754, 766 (9th Cir. 2004) (holding \nplaintiffs’ risk of medical complications outweighed the potential financial harm to the \ndefendants).   \n \nPlaintiffs fail to carry their burden on the public interest prong.  The Court is not \nconvinced that the relief requested is demonstrably in the public interest during this pandemic.  \nFor example, Plaintiffs suggest that GEO hire additional staff to clean the common areas, so they \nare not forced to.  (App. Reply at 18.)  However, it is not clear to the Court that introducing more \n \n5 The CDC Community Facilities Guidance attached by Plaintiffs in their supplemental \nfiling states that the “risk of exposure to cleaning staff is inherently low.”  (Community Facilities \nGuidance at 4.)   It is not clear whether the risk referenced is laundry duty or cleaning generally.  \nEither way, it is unhelpful to Plaintiffs.  The expert declaration also seems to ignore that the CDC \nInterim Guidance recommends gowns, but does not mention masks. \nPage 11 of 13  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk iv   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 268   Filed 04/22/20   Page 12 of 13   Page ID\n #:5949\noutsiders to the facility will reduce the risk of infection to Class Members.  An injunction to this \neffect could force GEO to increase staffing, which would increase the ingress and egress of \nasymptomatic individuals from outside the facility, increasing the risk of a facility outbreak. \n \nNext, Plaintiffs ask the Court to enter an injunction requiring GEO to provide them with \nPPE.  The Court is hesitant to enter an injunction forcing a reallocation of limited PPE resources \nto favor Class Members over detainees or staff working elsewhere in the facility for several \nreasons.  First, GEO’s current distribution of PPE is likely calculated to reduce the overall \nlikelihood of a facility outbreak.  Plaintiffs include insufficient evidence for the Court to second \nguess GEO’s hazard assessment for specific job duties.6 \n \nSecond, the Court lacks sufficient evidence on the availability of PPE, specifically gloves \nand gowns, to GEO.  (See Van Pelt Decl. II, Ex. E ¶ 10 (listing GEO’s attempts to purchase PPE \nand supply chain shortages and shipment delays GEO has encountered).)  In the abstract, and \nassuming adequate supplies for all, it would almost certainly be in the public interest to grant \nrelief.  However, Plaintiffs simply do not make a case that this is the reality in mid-April 2020, \nwhen the country is at near peak resource utilization, and even front-line healthcare workers have \nat times struggled to secure PPE.  For these reasons, the Court agrees with GEO that Plaintiffs’ \nrequested relief is not in the public interest at this time. \n \nAccordingly, the Application is DENIED.  The Court is not persuaded that immediate \nrelief is warranted in this case.  The Court hopes that as PPE becomes more widely available, any \ngaps7 between GEO facility conditions and the CDC Guidance now binding on all ICE facilities \nwill be addressed.  In the meantime, the Court notes the CDC calls on facility administrators to \n \n6 Given limited availability of N95 and surgical masks, for example, it might not be in the \npublic interest to require these for Class Members cleaning their own unit common areas.  \nAssuming GEO is obtaining as many masks as it can, the public interest factor requires the Court \nto consider the maximally beneficial distribution of those masks.  GEO might prioritize giving \nmasks to kitchen workers or individuals circulating through multiple parts of the facility, for \nexample detainees distributing food.  In any case, as noted in the fact section, the CDC does not \nrecommend surgical or N95 masks for cleaning duty.  Gloves may also be in short supply, but \nGEO stated in the April 16, 2020 hearing that gloves are now made available for cleaning tasks.  \nNeither of the parties says much on the subject of gowns, though the CDC recommends several \npotential gown substitutes. \n7 Plaintiffs’ supplement repeatedly hammers the point that GEO must comply with the \nPandemic Response Requirements.  However, few if any of Plaintiffs’ declarations show the \nconditions of confinement in GEO facilities since the April 10, 2020 Response Requirements \nwere issued, and Plaintiffs provide no new declarations on this point.  As a result there is no \nevidence that GEO “refuses” to comply with the Pandemic Response Requirements.  (Pls.’ \nSupp. at 11.) \n \nPage 12 of 13  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk iv   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 268   Filed 04/22/20   Page 13 of 13   Page ID\n #:5950\nprovide detainees with information about PPE shortages and the recommended PPE for different \ndegrees of COVID-19 contact.8  (CDC Interim Guidance at 19.)   \n \nD. Expedited Discovery \n \nPlaintiffs seek discovery to prepare for a preliminary injunction hearing.  The requested \ndiscovery consists of answers to eight (8) interrogatories and twenty-nine (29) requests for \nadmissions, and a corporate representative to give testimony on twelve (12) topics.  (Mot. at 6.) \n \nThe Court DENIES the Motion.  Plaintiffs do not deny they failed to meet and confer \nwith Defendant regarding the Motion as required by Local Rules, and they did not file a Reply.  \n(Mot. Opp’n at 2.)  In addition, discovery matters must be brought before Magistrate Judge \nKewalramani, pursuant to the Standing Order.  (Dkt. No. 17.)  Hybrid ex parte applications, \nthose outside the framework of the rules, are “inherently unfair, and they pose a threat to the \nadministration of justice.”  Mission Power Eng’g Co. v. Cont’l Cas. Co., 883 F. Supp. 488, 490 \n(C.D. Cal. 1995).   \n \nE.  Plaintiffs’ Abuse of Footnotes \n \nThe Court takes this opportunity to address Plaintiffs’ abuse of footnotes.  Plaintiffs’ \nApplication and Application Reply include close to 160 footnotes, using what appears to be size \nten or eleven font.  On some pages, up to half the page is occupied by lengthy string citations and \nquotes.  Plaintiffs’ Counsel seems to have abandoned any attempt to include case and record \ncitations in the body of the main text.   \n \nThe use of single-spaced footnotes is allowed by Local Rule, but there is no footnote \nexception for the font size and legibility requirements.  See L.R. 11-3.1.1.  In addition, the overuse \nof footnotes to scrounge additional lines of argument renders page limitations pointless and is \nunfair to Defendant.  Questions of fairness aside, it is ineffective advocacy to force the reader to \nplay a dizzying game of optical hopscotch.  The Court directs Plaintiffs to not misuse footnotes in \nthe future and to review Local Rule 11-3.   \n \nIV.   CONCLUSION \n \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES Plaintiffs’ ex parte application for a \ntemporary restraining order, and DENIES Plaintiffs’ motion for expedited discovery.   \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n \n \n8 The Court notes GEO’s proposed “compromise.”  (Def.’s Supp. at 8.)  GEO states it is \n“amenable” to providing cloth face coverings to its detainees nationwide by April 23, 2020, if not \nsooner.  The proposal is confusing.  As of April 10, 2020 the Pandemic Response Requirements \nrequire GEO to provide cloth facemasks.

Please check the CDC website periodically for updated interim guidance. \nThis document provides interim guidance specific for correctional facilities and detention centers during the \noutbreak of COVID-19, to ensure continuation of essential public services and protection of the health and safety of \nincarcerated and detained persons, staff, and visitors. Recommendations may need to be revised as more \ninformation becomes available. \nWho is the intended audience for this guidance? \nThis document is intended to provide guiding principles for healthcare and non-healthcare administrators of correctional \nand detention facilities (including but not limited to federal and state prisons, local jails, and detention centers), law \nenforcement agencies that have custodial authority for detained populations (i.e., US Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement and US Marshals Service), and their respective health departments, to assist in preparing for potential \nintroduction, spread, and mitigation of COVID-19 in their facilities. In general, the document uses terminology referring to \ncorrectional environments but can also be applied to civil and pre-trial detention settings. \nThis guidance will not necessarily address every possible custodial setting and may not use legal terminology specific to \nindividual agencies' authorities or processes. The guidance may need to be adapted based on individual facilities' \nphysical space, staffing, population, operations, and other resources and conditions. Facilities should contact \nCDC or their state, local, territorial, and/or tribal public health department if they need assistance in applying these \nprinciples or addressing topics that are not specifically covered in this guidance. \nWhy is this guidance being issued? \nCorrectional and detention facilities can include custody, housing, education, recreation, healthcare, food service, and \nworkplace components in a single physical setting. The integration of these components presents unique challenges for \ncontrol of COVID-19 transmission among incarcerated/detained persons, staff, and visitors. Consistent application of \nspecific preparation, prevention, and management measures can help reduce the risk of transmission and severe disease \nfrom COVID-19. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 1 of 26 \n\nCCaassee  55::1177--ccvv--0022551144--JJGGBB--SSHHKK    DDooccuummeenntt  225662--21    FFiilleedd  0044//0183//2200    PPaaggee  1102  ooff  6631    PPaaggee  IIDD \n ##::55374367 \n•  Incarcerated/detained persons live, work, eat, study, and recreate within congregate environments, heightening the \npotential for COVID-19 to spread once introduced. \n•  In most cases, incarcerated/detained persons are not permitted to leave the facility. \n•  There are many opportunities for COVID-19 to be introduced into a correctional or detention facility, including daily \nstaff ingress and egress; transfer of incarcerated/detained persons between facilities and systems, to court \nappearances, and to outside medical visits; and visits from family, legal representatives, and other community \nmembers. Some settings, particularly jails and detention centers, have high turnover, admitting new entrants daily \nwho may have been exposed to COVID-19 in the surrounding community or other regions. \n•  Persons incarcerated/detained in a particular facility often come from a variety of locations, increasing the potential \nto introduce COVID-19 from different geographic areas. \n•  Options for medical isolation of COVID-19 cases are limited and vary depending on the type and size of facility, as \nwell as the current level of available capacity, which is partly based on medical isolation needs for other conditions. \n•  Adequate levels of custody and healthcare staffing must be maintained to ensure safe operation of the facility, and \noptions to practice social distancing through work alternatives such as working from home or reduced/alternate \nschedules are limited for many staff roles. \n•  Correctional and detention facilities can be complex, multi-employer settings that include government and private \nemployers. Each is organizationally distinct and responsible for its own operational, personnel, and occupational \nhealth protocols and may be prohibited from issuing guidance or providing services to other employers or their staff \nwithin the same setting. Similarly, correctional and detention facilities may house individuals from multiple law \nenforcement agencies or jurisdictions subject to different policies and procedures. \n•  Incarcerated/detained persons and staff may have medical conditions that increase their risk of severe disease from \nCOVID-19. \n•  Because limited outside information is available to many incarcerated/detained persons, unease and \nmisinformation regarding the potential for COVID-19 spread may be high, potentially creating security and morale \nchallenges. \n•  The ability of incarcerated/detained persons to exercise disease prevention measures (e.g., frequent handwashing) \nmay be limited and is determined by the supplies provided in the facility and by security considerations. Many \nfacilities restrict access to soap and paper towels and prohibit alcohol-based hand sanitizer and many disinfectants. \n•  Incarcerated persons may hesitate to report symptoms of COVID-19 or seek medical care due to co-pay \nrequirements and fear of isolation. \nCDC has issued separate COVID-19 guidance addressing healthcare infection control and clinical care of COVID-19 cases \nas well as close contacts of cases in community-based settings. Where relevant, community-focused guidance documents \nare referenced in this document and should be monitored regularly for updates, but they may require adaptation for \ncorrectional and detention settings. \nThis guidance document provides additional recommended best practices specifically for correctional and detention \nfacilities. At this time, different facility types (e.g., prison vs. jail) and sizes are not differentiated. \nAdministrators and agencies should adapt these guiding principles to the specific needs of their facility. \nWhat topics does this guidance include? \nThe guidance below includes detailed recommendations on the following topics related to COVID-19 in correctional and \ndetention settings: \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 2 of 26 \n\nCCaassee  55::1177--ccvv--0022551144--JJGGBB--SSHHKK    DDooccuummeenntt  225662--21    FFiilleedd  0044//0183//2200    PPaaggee  1113  ooff  6613    PPaaggee  IIDD \n ##::55374378 \n• Operational and communications preparations for COVID-19 \n• Enhanced cleaning/disinfecting and hygiene practices \n• Social distancing strategies to increase space between individuals in the facility \n• How to limit transmission from visitors \n• Infection control, including recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) and potential alternatives during \nPPE shortages \n•  Verbal screening and temperature check protocols for incoming incarcerated/detained individuals, staff, and visitors \n•  Medical isolation of confirmed and suspected cases and quarantine of contacts, including considerations for \ncohorting when individual spaces are limited \n• Healthcare evaluation for suspected cases, including testing for COVID-19 \n• Clinical care for confirmed and suspected cases \n• Considerations for persons at higher risk of severe disease from COVID-19 \nDefinitions of Commonly Used Terms \nClose contact of a COVID-19 case - In the context of COVID-19, an individual is considered a close contact if they a) \nhave been within approximately 6 feet of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time or b) have had direct contact \nwith infectious secretions from a COVID-19 case (e.g., have been coughed on). Close contact can occur while caring for, \nliving with, visiting, or sharing a common space with a COVID-19 case. Data to inform the definition of close contact are \nlimited. Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely \nincreases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure \nrisk, as does exposure to a severely ill patient). \nCohorting - Cohorting refers to the practice of isolating multiple laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases together as a \ngroup, or quarantining close contacts of a particular case together as a group. Ideally, cases should be isolated \nindividually, and close contacts should be quarantined individually. However, some correctional facilities and detention \ncenters do not have enough individual cells to do so and must consider cohorting as an alternative. See Quarantine and \nMedical Isolation sections below for specific details about ways to implement cohorting to minimize the risk of disease \nspread and adverse health outcomes. \nCommunity transmission of COVID-19 - Community transmission of COVID-19 occurs when individuals acquire the \ndisease through contact with someone in their local community, rather than through travel to an affected location. Once \ncommunity transmission is identified in a particular area, correctional facilities and detention centers are more likely to \nstart seeing cases inside their walls. Facilities should consult with local public health departments if assistance is needed \nin determining how to define \"local community\" in the context of COVID-19 spread. However, because all states have \nreported cases, all facilities should be vigilant for introduction into their populations. \nConfirmed vs. Suspected COVID-19 case - A confirmed case has received a positive result from a COVID-19 \nlaboratory test, with or without symptoms. A suspected case shows symptoms of COVID-19 but either has not been \ntested or is awaiting test results. If test results are positive, a suspected case becomes a confirmed case. \nIncarcerated/detained persons - For the purpose of this document, \"incarcerated/detained persons\" refers to persons \nheld in a prison, jail, detention center, or other custodial setting where these guidelines are generally applicable. The term \nincludes those who have been sentenced (i.e., in prisons) as well as those held for pre-trial (i.e., jails) or civil purposes (i.e, \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 3 of 26 \n\nCCaassee  55::1177--ccvv--0022551144--JJGGBB--SSHHKK    DDooccuummeenntt  225662--21    FFiilleedd  0044//0183//2200    PPaaggee  1124  ooff  6631    PPaaggee  IIDD \n ##::55374389 \ndetention centers). Although this guidance does not specifically reference individuals in every type of custodial setting \n(e.g., juvenile facilities, community confinement facilities), facility administrators can adapt this guidance to apply to their \nspecific circumstances as needed. \nMedical Isolation - Medical isolation refers to confining a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case (ideally to a single cell \nwith solid walls and a solid door that closes), to prevent contact with others and to reduce the risk of transmission. \nMedical isolation ends when the individual meets pre-established clinical and/or testing criteria for release from isolation, \nin consultation with clinical providers and public health officials (detailed in guidance below). In this context, isolation \ndoes NOT refer to punitive isolation for behavioral infractions within the custodial setting. Staff are encouraged to use the \nterm \"medical isolation\" to avoid confusion. \nQuarantine - Quarantine refers to the practice of confining individuals who have had close contact with a COVID-19 case \nto determine whether they develop symptoms of the disease. Quarantine for COVID-19 should last for a period of 14 \ndays. Ideally, each quarantined individual would be quarantined in a single cell with solid walls and a solid door that \ncloses. If symptoms develop during the 14-day period, the individual should be placed under medical isolation and \nevaluated for COVID-19. If symptoms do not develop, movement restrictions can be lifted, and the individual can return \nto their previous residency status within the facility. \nSocial Distancing - Social distancing is the practice of increasing the space between individuals and decreasing the \nfrequency of contact to reduce the risk of spreading a disease (ideally to maintain at least 6 feet between all individuals, \neven those who are asymptomatic). Social distancing strategies can be applied on an individual level (e.g., avoiding \nphysical contact), a group level (e.g., canceling group activities where individuals will be in close contact), and an \noperational level (e.g., rearranging chairs in the dining hall to increase distance between them). Although social distancing \nis challenging to practice in correctional and detention environments, it is a cornerstone of reducing transmission of \nrespiratory diseases such as COVID-19. Additional information about social distancing, including information on its use to \nreduce the spread of other viral illnesses, is available in this CDC publication III . \nStaff - In this document, \"staff' refers to all public sector employees as well as those working for a private contractor \nwithin a correctional facility (e.g., private healthcare or food service). Except where noted, \"staff' does not distinguish \nbetween healthcare, custody, and other types of staff including private facility operators. \nSymptoms - Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Like other respiratory infections, \nCOVID-19 can vary in severity from mild to severe. When severe, pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death are possible. \nCOVID-19 is a novel disease, therefore the full range of signs and symptoms, the clinical course of the disease, and the \nindividuals and populations most at risk for disease and complications are not yet fully understood. Monitor the CDC \nwebsite for updates on these topics. \nFacilities with Limited Onsite Healthcare Services \nAlthough many large facilities such as prisons and some jails usually employ onsite healthcare staff and have the capacity \nto evaluate incarcerated/detained persons for potential illness within a dedicated healthcare space, many smaller \nfacilities do not. Some of these facilities have access to on-call healthcare staff or providers who visit the facility every few \ndays. Others have neither onsite healthcare capacity nor onsite medical isolation/quarantine space and must transfer ill \npatients to other correctional or detention facilities or local hospitals for evaluation and care. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 4 of 26 \n\nCCaassee  55::1177--ccvv--0022551144--JJGGBB--SSHHKK    DDooccuummeenntt  225662--21    FFiilleedd  0044//0183//2200    PPaaggee  1135  ooff  6631    PPaaggee  IIDD \n ##::55374490 \nThe majority of the guidance below is designed to be applied to any correctional or detention facility, either as written or \nwith modifications based on a facility's individual structure and resources. However, topics related to healthcare \nevaluation and clinical care of confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases and their close contacts may not apply directly to \nfacilities with limited or no onsite healthcare services. It will be especially important for these types of facilities to \ncoordinate closely with their state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health department when they encounter confirmed or \nsuspected cases among incarcerated/detained persons or staff, in order to ensure effective medical isolation and \nquarantine, necessary medical evaluation and care, and medical transfer if needed. The guidance makes note of \nstrategies tailored to facilities without onsite healthcare where possible. \nNote that all staff in any sized facility, regardless of the presence of onsite healthcare services, should observe guidance \non recommended PPE in order to ensure their own safety when interacting with confirmed and suspected COVID-19 \ncases. Facilities should make contingency plans for the likely event of PPE shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic. \nCOVID-19 Guidance for Correctional Facilities \nGuidance for correctional and detention facilities is organized into 3 sections: Operational Preparedness, Prevention, and \nManagement of COVID-19. Recommendations across these sections can be applied simultaneously based on the \nprogress of the outbreak in a particular facility and the surrounding community. \n• Operational Preparedness. This guidance is intended to help facilities prepare for potential COVID-19 \ntransmission in the facility. Strategies focus on operational and communications planning and personnel practices. \n• Prevention. This guidance is intended to help facilities prevent spread of COVID-19 from outside the facility to \ninside. Strategies focus on reinforcing hygiene practices, intensifying cleaning and disinfection of the facility, \nscreening (new intakes, visitors, and staff), continued communication with incarcerated/detained persons and staff, \nand social distancing measures (increasing distance between individuals). \n•  Management. This guidance is intended to help facilities clinically manage confirmed and suspected COVID-19 \ncases inside the facility and prevent further transmission. Strategies include medical isolation and care of \nincarcerated/detained persons with symptoms (including considerations for cohorting), quarantine of cases' close \ncontacts, restricting movement in and out of the facility, infection control practices for individuals interacting with \ncases and quarantined contacts or contaminated items, intensified social distancing, and cleaning and disinfecting \nareas visited by cases. \nOperational Preparedness \nAdministrators can plan and prepare for COVID-19 by ensuring that all persons in the facility know the symptoms of \nCOVID-19 and how to respond if they develop symptoms. Other essential actions include developing contingency plans \nfor reduced workforces due to absences, coordinating with public health and correctional partners, and communicating \nclearly with staff and incarcerated/detained persons about these preparations and how they may temporarily alter daily \nlife. \nCommunication & Coordination \n•  Develop information-sharing systems with partners. \no  Identify points of contact in relevant state, local, tribal, and/or territorial public health departments before \ncases develop. Actively engage with the health department to understand in advance which entity has \njurisdiction to implement public health control measures for COVID-19 in a particular correctional or detention \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 5 of 26 \n\nCCaassee  55::1177--ccvv--0022551144--JJGGBB--SSHHKK    DDooccuummeenntt  225662--21    FFiilleedd  0044//0183//2200    PPaaggee  1146  ooff  6613    PPaaggee  IIDD \n ##::55375401 \nfacility. \no  Create and test communications plans to disseminate critical information to incarcerated/detained persons, \nstaff, contractors, vendors, and visitors as the pandemic progresses. \no  Communicate with other correctional facilities in the same geographic area to share information including \ndisease surveillance and absenteeism patterns among staff. \no  Where possible, put plans in place with other jurisdictions to prevent confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases \nand their close contacts from being transferred between jurisdictions and facilities unless necessary for \nmedical evaluation, medical isolation/quarantine, clinical care, extenuating security concerns, or to prevent \novercrowding. \no  Stay informed about updates to CDC guidance via the CDC COVID-19 website as more information becomes \nknown. \n• Review existing pandemic flu, all-hazards, and disaster plans, and revise for COVID-19. \no  Ensure that physical locations (dedicated housing areas and bathrooms) have been identified to isolate \nconfirmed COVID-19 cases and individuals displaying COVID-19 symptoms, and to quarantine known close \ncontacts of cases. (Medical isolation and quarantine locations should be separate). The plan should include \ncontingencies for multiple locations if numerous cases and/or contacts are identified and require medical \nisolation or quarantine simultaneously. See Medical Isolation and Quarantine sections below for details \nregarding individual medical isolation and quarantine locations (preferred) vs. cohorting. \no  Facilities without onsite healthcare capacity should make a plan for how they will ensure that suspected COVID-\n19 cases will be isolated, evaluated, tested (if indicated), and provided necessary medical care. \no  Make a list of possible social distancing strategies that could be implemented as needed at different stages of \ntransmission intensity. \no  Designate officials who will be authorized to make decisions about escalating or de-escalating response efforts \nas the epidemiologic context changes. \n•  Coordinate with local law enforcement and court officials. \no  Identify lawful alternatives to in-person court appearances, such as virtual court, as a social distancing measure \nto reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. \no  Explore strategies to prevent over-crowding of correctional and detention facilities during a community \noutbreak. \n• Post signage throughout the facility communicating the following: \no  For all: symptoms of COVID-19 and hand hygiene instructions \no  For incarcerated/detained persons: report symptoms to staff \no  For staff stay at home when sick; if symptoms develop while on duty, leave the facility as soon as possible and \nfollow CDC-recommended steps for persons who are ill with COVID-19 symptoms including self-isolating at \nhome, contacting their healthcare provider as soon as possible to determine whether they need to be \nevaluated and tested, and contacting their supervisor. \no  Ensure that signage is understandable for non-English speaking persons and those with low literacy, and make \nnecessary accommodations for those with cognitive or intellectual disabilities and those who are deaf, blind, or \nlow-vision. \nPersonnel Practices \n•  Review the sick leave policies of each employer that operates in the facility. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 6 of 26 \n\nCCaassee  55::1177--ccvv--0022551144--JJGGBB--SSHHKK    DDooccuummeenntt  225662--21    FFiilleedd  0044//0183//2200    PPaaggee  1157  ooff  6631    PPaaggee  IIDD \n ##::55734521 \no  Review policies to ensure that they actively encourage staff to stay home when sick. \no  if these policies do not encourage staff to stay home when sick, discuss with the contract company. \no  Determine which officials will have the authority to send symptomatic staff home. \n•  Identify staff whose duties would allow them to work from home. Where possible, allowing staff to work \nfrom home can be an effective social distancing strategy to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. \no  Discuss work from home options with these staff and determine whether they have the supplies and \ntechnological equipment required to do so. \no  Put systems in place to implement work from home programs (e.g., time tracking, etc.). \n•  Plan for staff absences. Staff should stay home when they are sick, or they may need to stay home to care for a \nsick household member or care for children in the event of school and childcare dismissals. \no  Allow staff to work from home when possible, within the scope of their duties. \no  Identify critical job functions and plan for alternative coverage by cross-training staff where possible. \no  Determine minimum levels of staff in all categories required for the facility to function safely. If possible, \ndevelop a plan to secure additional staff if absenteeism due to COVID-19 threatens to bring staffing to \nminimum levels. \no  Consider increasing keep on person (KOP) medication orders to cover 30 days in case of healthcare staff \nshortages. \n•  Consider offering revised duties to staff who are at higher risk of severe illness with COVID-19. Persons \nat higher risk may include older adults and persons of any age with serious underlying medical conditions including \nlung disease, heart disease, and diabetes. See CDC's website for a complete list, and check regularly for updates as \nmore data become available to inform this issue. \no  Facility administrators should consult with their occupational health providers to determine whether it would \nbe allowable to reassign duties for specific staff members to reduce their likelihood of exposure to COVID-19. \n•  Offer the seasonal influenza vaccine to all incarcerated/detained persons (existing population and new \nintakes) and staff throughout the influenza season. Symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of influenza. \nPreventing influenza cases in a facility can speed the detection of COVID-19 cases and reduce pressure on \nhealthcare resources. \n•  Reference the Occupational Safety and Health Administration website El'  for recommendations \nregarding worker health. \n•  Review CDC's guidance for businesses and employers to identify any additional strategies the facility can use \nwithin its role as an employer. \nOperations & Supplies \n•  Ensure that sufficient stocks of hygiene supplies, cleaning supplies, PPE, and medical supplies \n(consistent with the healthcare capabilities of the facility) are on hand and available, and have a plan in \nplace to restock as needed if COVID-19 transmission occurs within the facility. \no  Standard medical supplies for daily clinic needs \no  Tissues \no  Liquid soap when possible. If bar soap must be used, ensure that it does not irritate the skin and thereby \nhttps://www.cdc.govicoronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 7 of 26 \n\nCCaassee  55::1177--ccvv--0022551144--JJGGBB--SSHHKK    DDooccuummeenntt  225662--21    FFiilleedd  0044//0183//2200    PPaaggee  1168  ooff  6631    PPaaggee  IIDD \n ##::55375423 \ndiscourage frequent hand washing. \no  Hand drying supplies \no  Alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol (where permissible based on security restrictions) \no  Cleaning supplies, including EPA-registered disinfectants effective against the virus that causes COVID-19 Z \no  Recommended PPE (facemasks, N95 respirators, eye protection, disposable medical gloves, and disposable \ngowns/one-piece coveralls).

If soap and water are not available, CDC recommends cleaning hands with an alcohol-\nbased hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Consider allowing staff to carry individual-sized bottles for \ntheir personal hand hygiene while on duty. \n•  Provide a no-cost supply of soap to incarcerated/detained persons, sufficient to allow frequent hand \nwashing. (See Hygiene section below for additional detail regarding recommended frequency and protocol for hand \nwashing.) \no  Provide liquid soap where possible. If bar soap must be used, ensure that it does not irritate the skin and \nthereby discourage frequent hand washing. \n•  If not already in place, employers operating within the facility should establish a respiratory protection \nprogram as appropriate, to ensure that staff and incarcerated/detained persons are fit tested for any \nrespiratory protection they will need within the scope of their responsibilities. \n•  Ensure that staff and incarcerated/detained persons are trained to correctly don, doff, and dispose of \nPPE that they will need to use within the scope of their responsibilities. See Table 1 for recommended PPE \nfor incarcerated/detained persons and staff with varying levels of contact with COVID-19 cases or their close \ncontacts. \nPrevention \nCases of COVID-19 have been documented in all 50 US states. Correctional and detention facilities can prevent \nintroduction of COVID-19 from the community and reduce transmission if it is already inside by reinforcing good hygiene \npractices among incarcerated/detained persons, staff, and visitors (including increasing access to soap and paper towels), \nintensifying cleaning/disinfection practices, and implementing social distancing strategies. \nBecause many individuals infected with COVID-19 do not display symptoms, the virus could be present in facilities before \ncases are identified. Both good hygiene practices and social distancing are critical in preventing further transmission. \nOperations \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 8 of 26 \n\nCCaassee  55::1177--ccvv--0022551144--JJGGBB--SSHHKK    DDooccuummeenntt  225662--21    FFiilleedd  0044//0183//2200    PPaaggee  1179  ooff  6631    PPaaggee  IIDD \n ##::55375434 \n•  Stay in communication with partners about your facility's current situation. \no  State, local, territorial, and/or tribal health departments \no  Other correctional facilities \n• Communicate with the public about any changes to facility operations, including visitation programs. \n•  Restrict transfers of incarcerated/detained persons to and from other jurisdictions and facilities unless \nnecessary for medical evaluation, medical isolation/quarantine, clinical care, extenuating security \nconcerns, or to prevent overcrowding. \no  Strongly consider postponing non-urgent outside medical visits. \no  If a transfer is absolutely necessary, perform verbal screening and a temperature check as outlined in the \nScreening section below, before the individual leaves the facility. If an individual does not clear the screening \nprocess, delay the transfer and follow the protocol for a suspected COVID-19 case - including putting a face \nmask on the individual, immediately placing them under medical isolation, and evaluating them for possible \nCOVID-19 testing. If the transfer must still occur, ensure that the receiving facility has capacity to properly \nisolate the individual upon arrival. Ensure that staff transporting the individual wear recommended PPE (see \nTable 1) and that the transport vehicle is cleaned thoroughly after transport. \n•  Implement lawful alternatives to in-person court appearances where permissible. \n•  Where relevant, consider suspending co-pays for incarcerated/detained persons seeking medical \nevaluation for respiratory symptoms. \n•  Limit the number of operational entrances and exits to the facility. \nCleaning and Disinfecting Practices \n•  Even if COVID-19 cases have not yet been identified inside the facility or in the surrounding community, \nbegin implementing intensified cleaning and disinfecting procedures according to the \nrecommendations below. These measures may prevent spread of COVID-19 if introduced. \n•  Adhere to CDC recommendations for cleaning and disinfection during the COVID-19 response. Monitor \nthese recommendations for updates. \no  Several times per day, clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that are frequently touched, especially in \ncommon areas. Such surfaces may include objects/surfaces not ordinarily cleaned daily (e.g., doorknobs, light \nswitches, sink handles, countertops, toilets, toilet handles, recreation equipment, kiosks, and telephones). \no  Staff should clean shared equipment several times per day and on a conclusion of use basis (e.g., radios, \nservice weapons, keys, handcuffs). \no  Use household cleaners and EPA-registered disinfectants effective against the virus that causes COVID-19 Cl \nas appropriate for the surface, following label instructions. This may require lifting restrictions on undiluted \ndisinfectants. \no  Labels contain instructions for safe and effective use of the cleaning product, including precautions that should \nbe taken when applying the product, such as wearing gloves and making sure there is good ventilation during \nuse. \n•  Consider increasing the number of staff and/or incarcerated/detained persons trained and responsible \nfor cleaning common areas to ensure continual cleaning of these areas throughout the day. \n•  Ensure adequate supplies to support intensified cleaning and disinfection practices, and have a plan in \nplace to restock rapidly if needed. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 9 of 26 \n\nCCaassee  55::1177--ccvv--0022551144--JJGGBB--SSHHKK    DDooccuummeenntt  225662--21    FFiilleedd  0044//0183//2200    PPaaggee  1280  ooff  6631    PPaaggee  IIDD \n ##::55375454 \nHygiene \n•  Reinforce healthy hygiene practices, and provide and continually restock hygiene supplies throughout \nthe facility, including in bathrooms, food preparation and dining areas, intake areas, visitor entries and \nexits, visitation rooms and waiting rooms, common areas, medical, and staff-restricted areas (e.g., \nbreak rooms). \n•  Encourage all persons in the facility to take the following actions to protect themselves and others from \nCOVID-19. Post signage throughout the facility, and communicate this information verbally on a regular \nbasis. Sample signage and other communications materials are available on the CDC website. Ensure \nthat materials can be understood by non-English speakers and those with low literacy, and make necessary \naccommodations for those with cognitive or intellectual disabilities and those who are deaf, blind, or low-vision. \no  Practice good cough etiquette: Cover your mouth and nose with your elbow (or ideally with a tissue) rather \nthan with your hand when you cough or sneeze, and throw all tissues in the trash immediately after use. \no  Practice good hand hygiene: Regularly wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, \nespecially after coughing, sneezing, or blowing your nose; after using the bathroom; before eating or preparing \nfood; before taking medication; and after touching garbage. \no  Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth without cleaning your hands first. \no  Avoid sharing eating utensils, dishes, and cups. \no  Avoid non-essential physical contact. \n•  Provide incarcerated/detained persons and staff no-cost access to: \no  Soap - Provide liquid soap where possible. If bar soap must be used, ensure that it does not irritate the skin, as \nthis would discourage frequent hand washing. \no  Running water, and hand drying machines or disposable paper towels for hand washing \no  Tissues and no-touch trash receptacles for disposal \n•  Provide alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol where permissible based on security \nrestrictions. Consider allowing staff to carry individual-sized bottles to maintain hand hygiene. \n•  Communicate that sharing drugs and drug preparation equipment can spread COVID-19 due to \npotential contamination of shared items and close contact between individuals. \nPrevention Practices for Incarcerated/Detained Persons \n•  Perform pre-intake screening and temperature checks for all new entrants. Screening should take place \nin the sallyport, before beginning the intake process, in order to identify and immediately place individuals \nwith symptoms under medical isolation. See Screening section below for the wording of screening questions and a \nrecommended procedure to safely perform a temperature check. Staff performing temperature checks should wear \nrecommended PPE (see PPE section below). \no  If an individual has symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough, shortness of breath): \nЬ  Require the individual to wear a face mask. \nЬ  Ensure that staff who have direct contact with the symptomatic individual wear recommended PPE. \nЬ  Place the individual under medical isolation (ideally in a room near the screening location, rather than \ntransporting the ill individual through the facility), and refer to healthcare staff for further evaluation. (See \nInfection Control and Clinical Care sections below.) \nЬ  Facilities without onsite healthcare staff should contact their state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 10 of 26 \n\nCCaassee  55::1177--ccvv--0022551144--JJGGBB--SSHHKK    DDooccuummeenntt  225662--21    FFiilleedd  0044//0183//2200    PPaaggee  1291  ooff  6631    PPaaggee  IIDD \n ##::55375456 \ndepartment to coordinate effective medical isolation and necessary medical care. \no  If an individual is a close contact of a known COVID-19 case (but has no COVID-19 symptoms): \nЬ Quarantine the individual and monitor for symptoms two times per day for 14 days. (See Quarantine \nsection below.) \nЬ  Facilities without onsite healthcare staff should contact their state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health \ndepartment to coordinate effective quarantine and necessary medical care. \n• Implement social distancing strategies to increase the physical space between incarcerated/detained \npersons (ideally 6 feet between all individuals, regardless of the presence of symptoms). Strategies will \nneed to be tailored to the individual space in the facility and the needs of the population and staff. Not all strategies \nwill be feasible in all facilities. Example strategies with varying levels of intensity include: \no  Common areas: \nЬ  Enforce increased space between individuals in holding cells, as well as in lines and waiting areas such as \nintake (e.g., remove every other chair in a waiting area) \no  Recreation: \nЬ  Choose recreation spaces where individuals can spread out \nЬ  Stagger time in recreation spaces \nЬ  Restrict recreation space usage to a single housing unit per space \n(where feasible) \no  Meals: \nЬ  Stagger meals \nЬ  Rearrange seating in the dining hall so that there is more space between individuals (e.g., remove every \nother chair and use only one side of the table) \nЬ  Provide meals inside housing units or cells \no  Group activities: \nЬ  Limit the size of group activities \nЬ  Increase space between individuals during group activities \nЬ  Suspend group programs where participants are likely to be in closer contact than they are in their \nhousing environment \nЬ  Consider alternatives to existing group activities, in outdoor areas or other areas where individuals can \nspread out \no  Housing: \nЬ  If space allows, reassign bunks to provide more space between individuals, ideally 6 feet or more in all \ndirections. (Ensure that bunks are cleaned thoroughly if assigned to a new occupant.) \nЬ  Arrange bunks so that individuals sleep head to foot to increase the distance between them \nЬ  Rearrange scheduled movements to minimize mixing of individuals from different housing areas \no  Medical: \nЬ  If possible, designate a room near each housing unit to evaluate individuals with COVID-19 symptoms, \nrather than having them walk through the facility to be evaluated in the medical unit. If this is not feasible, \nconsider staggering sick call. \nЬ  Designate a room near the intake area to evaluate new entrants who are flagged by the intake screening \nprocess for COVID-19 symptoms or case contact, before they move to other parts of the facility. \n•  Communicate clearly and frequently with incarcerated/detained persons about changes to their daily \nroutine and how they can contribute to risk reduction. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 11 of 26 \n\nCCaassee  55::1177--ccvv--0022551144--JJGGBB--SSHHKK    DDooccuummeenntt  225662--21    FFiilleedd  0044//0183//2200    PPaaggee  2202  ooff  6631    PPaaggee  IIDD \n ##::55375467 \n•  Note that if group activities are discontinued, it will be important to identify alternative forms of \nactivity to support the mental health of incarcerated/detained persons. \n• Consider suspending work release programs and other programs that involve movement of \nincarcerated/detained individuals in and out of the facility. \n•  Provide up-to-date information about COVID-19 to incarcerated/detained persons on a regular basis, \nincluding: \no  Symptoms of COVID-19 and its health risks \no  Reminders to report COVID-19 symptoms to staff at the first sign of illness \n•  Consider having healthcare staff perform rounds on a regular basis to answer questions about COVID-\n19. \nPrevention Practices for Staff \n•  Remind staff to stay at home if they are sick. Ensure that staff are aware that they will not be able to enter the \nfacility if they have symptoms of COVID-19, and that they will be expected to leave the facility as soon as possible if \nthey develop symptoms while on duty. \n•  Perform verbal screening (for COVID-19 symptoms and close contact with cases) and temperature \nchecks for all staff daily on entry. See Screening section below for wording of screening questions and a \nrecommended procedure to safely perform temperature checks. \no  In very small facilities with only a few staff, consider self-monitoring or virtual monitoring (e.g., reporting to a \ncentral authority via phone). \no  Send staff home who do not clear the screening process, and advise them to follow CDC-recommended steps \nfor persons who are ill with COVID-19 symptoms. \n•  Provide staff with up-to-date information about COVID-19 and about facility policies on a regular basis, \nincluding: \no  Symptoms of COVID-19 and its health risks \no  Employers' sick leave policy \no  If staff develop a fever, cough, or shortness of breath while at work: immediately put on a face mask, \ninform supervisor, leave the facility, and follow CDC-recommended steps for persons who are ill with COVID-19 \nsymptoms. \no  If staff test positive for COVID-19: inform workplace and personal contacts immediately, and do not return \nto work until a decision to discontinue home medical isolation precautions is made. Monitor CDC guidance on \ndiscontinuing home isolation regularly as circumstances evolve rapidly. \no  If a staff member is identified as a close contact of a COVID-19 case (either within the facility or in \nthe community): self-quarantine at home for 14 days and return to work if symptoms do not develop. If \nsymptoms do develop, follow CDC-recommended steps for persons who are ill with COVID-19 symptoms. \n•  If a staff member has a confirmed COVID-19 infection, the relevant employers should inform other staff \nabout their possible exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace, but should maintain confidentiality as \nrequired by the Americans with Disabilities Act. \no  Employees who are close contacts of the case should then self-monitor for symptoms (i.e., fever, cough, or \nshortness of breath). \n•  When feasible and consistent with security priorities, encourage staff to maintain a distance of 6 feet or \nmore from an individual with respiratory symptoms while interviewing, escorting, or interacting in \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 12 of 26 \n\nCCaassee  55::1177--ccvv--0022551144--JJGGBB--SSHHKK    DDooccuummeenntt  225662--21    FFiilleedd  0044//0183//2200    PPaaggee  2231  ooff  6631    PPaaggee  IIDD \n ##::55375478 \nother ways. \n•  Ask staff to keep interactions with individuals with respiratory symptoms as brief as possible. \nPrevention Practices for Visitors \n•  If possible, communicate with potential visitors to discourage contact visits in the interest of their own \nhealth and the health of their family members and friends inside the facility. \n•  Perform verbal screening (for COVID-19 symptoms and close contact with cases) and temperature \nchecks for all visitors and volunteers on entry. See Screening section below for wording of screening questions \nand a recommended procedure to safely perform temperature checks. \no  Staff performing temperature checks should wear recommended PPE. \no  Exclude visitors and volunteers who do not clear the screening process or who decline screening. \n•  Provide alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol in visitor entrances, exits, and waiting \nareas. \n•  Provide visitors and volunteers with information to prepare them for screening. \no  Instruct visitors to postpone their visit if they have symptoms of respiratory illness. \no  If possible, inform potential visitors and volunteers before they travel to the facility that they should expect to \nbe screened for COVID-19 (including a temperature check), and will be unable to enter the facility if they do not \nclear the screening process or if they decline screening. \no  Display signage outside visiting areas explaining the COVID-19 screening and temperature check process. \nEnsure that materials are understandable for non-English speakers and those with low literacy. \n•  Promote non-contact visits: \no  Encourage incarcerated/detained persons to limit contact visits in the interest of their own health and the \nhealth of their visitors. \no  Consider reducing or temporarily eliminating the cost of phone calls for incarcerated/detained persons. \no  Consider increasing incarcerated/detained persons' telephone privileges to promote mental health and reduce \nexposure from direct contact with community visitors. \n•  Consider suspending or modifying visitation programs, if legally permissible. For example, provide \naccess to virtual visitation options where available. \no  If moving to virtual visitation, clean electronic surfaces regularly. (See Cleaning guidance below for instructions \non cleaning electronic surfaces.) \no  Inform potential visitors of changes to, or suspension of, visitation programs. \no  Clearly communicate any visitation program changes to incarcerated/detained persons, along with the reasons \nfor them (including protecting their health and their family and community members' health). \no  If suspending contact visits, provide alternate means (e.g., phone or video visitation) for incarcerated/detained \nindividuals to engage with legal representatives, clergy, and other individuals with whom they have legal right \nto consult. \nNOTE: Suspending visitation would be done in the interest of incarcerated/detained persons' physical health and the \nhealth of the general public. However, visitation is important to maintain mental health. If visitation is suspended, \nfacilities should explore alternative ways for incarcerated/detained persons to communicate with their families, friends, \nand other visitors in a way that is not financially burdensome for them. See above suggestions for promoting non-contact \nvisits. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 13 of 26 \n\nCCaassee  55::1177--ccvv--0022551144--JJGGBB--SSHHKK    DDooccuummeenntt  225662--21    FFiilleedd  0044//0183//2200    PPaaggee  2224  ooff  6631    PPaaggee  IIDD \n ##::55375489 \n•  Restrict non-essential vendors, volunteers, and tours from entering the facility. \nManagement \nIf there has been a suspected COVID-19 case inside the facility (among incarcerated/detained persons, staff, or visitors \nwho have recently been inside), begin implementing Management strategies while test results are pending. Essential \nManagement strategies include placing cases and individuals with symptoms under medical isolation, quarantining their \nclose contacts, and facilitating necessary medical care, while observing relevant infection control and environmental \ndisinfection protocols and wearing recommended PPE. \nOperations \n•  Implement alternate work arrangements deemed feasible in the Operational Preparedness \n•  Suspend all transfers of incarcerated/detained persons to and from other jurisdictions and facilities \n(including work release where relevant), unless necessary for medical evaluation, medical \nisolation/quarantine, care, extenuating security concerns, or to prevent overcrowding. \no  If a transfer is absolutely necessary, perform verbal screening and a temperature check as outlined in the \nScreening section below, before the individual leaves the facility. If an individual does not clear the screening \nprocess, delay the transfer and follow the protocol for a suspected COVID-19 case - including putting a face \nmask on the individual, immediately placing them under medical isolation, and evaluating them for possible \nCOVID-19 testing. If the transfer must still occur, ensure that the receiving facility has capacity to appropriately \nisolate the individual upon arrival. Ensure that staff transporting the individual wear recommended PPE (see \nTable 1) and that the transport vehicle is cleaned thoroughly after transport. \n•  If possible, consider quarantining all new intakes for 14 days before they enter the facility's general \npopulation (SEPARATELY from other individuals who are quarantined due to contact with a COVID-19 \ncase). Subsequently in this document, this practice is referred to as routine intake quarantine. \n•  When possible, arrange lawful alternatives to in-person court appearances. \n•  Incorporate screening for COVID-19 symptoms and a temperature check into release planning. \no  Screen all releasing individuals for COVID-19 symptoms and perform a temperature check. (See Screening \nsection below.) \nЬ  If an individual does not clear the screening process, follow the protocol for a suspected COVID-19 case -\nincluding putting a face mask on the individual, immediately placing them under medical isolation, and \nevaluating them for possible COVID-19 testing. \nЬ  If the individual is released before the recommended medical isolation period is complete, discuss release \nof the individual with state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health departments to ensure safe medical \ntransport and continued shelter and medical care, as part of release planning. Make direct linkages to \ncommunity resources to ensure proper medical isolation and access to medical care. \nЬ  Before releasing an incarcerated/detained individual with COVID-19 symptoms to a community-based \nfacility, such as a homeless shelter, contact the facility's staff to ensure adequate time for them to prepare \nto continue medical isolation, or contact local public health to explore alternate housing options. \n•  Coordinate with state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health departments. \no  When a COVID-19 case is suspected, work with public health to determine action. See Medical Isolation section \nbelow. \no  When a COVID-19 case is suspected or confirmed, work with public health to identify close contacts who should \nbe placed under quarantine.

See Facilities with Limited Onsite Healthcare Services section. \nHygiene \n•  Continue to ensure that hand hygiene supplies are well-stocked in all areas of the facility. (See above.) \n•  Continue to emphasize practicing good hand hygiene and cough etiquette. (See above.) \nCleaning and Disinfecting Practices \n•  Continue adhering to recommended cleaning and disinfection procedures for the facility at large. (See \nabove.) \n•  Reference specific cleaning and disinfection procedures for areas where a COVID-19 case has spent \ntime (below). \nMedical Isolation of Confirmed or Suspected COVID-19 Cases \nNOTE: Some recommendations below apply primarily to facilities with onsite healthcare capacity. Facilities \nwithout onsite healthcare capacity, or without sufficient space to implement effective medical isolation, \nshould coordinate with local public health officials to ensure that COVID-19 cases will be appropriately \nisolated, evaluated, tested (if indicated), and given care. \n•  As soon as an individual develops symptoms of COVID-19, they should wear a face mask (if it does not \nrestrict breathing) and should be immediately placed under medical isolation in a separate \nenvironment from other individuals. \n•  Keep the individual's movement outside the medical isolation space to an absolute minimum. \no  Provide medical care to cases inside the medical isolation space. See Infection Control and Clinical Care \nsections for additional details. \no  Serve meals to cases inside the medical isolation space. \no  Exclude the individual from all group activities. \no  Assign the isolated individual a dedicated bathroom when possible. \n•  Ensure that the individual is wearing a face mask at all times when outside of the medical isolation \nspace, and whenever another individual enters. Provide clean masks as needed. Masks should be changed at \nleast daily, and when visibly soiled or wet. \n•  Facilities should make every possible effort to place suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases under \nmedical isolation individually. Each isolated individual should be assigned their own housing space and \nbathroom where possible. Cohorting should only be practiced if there are no other available options. \no  If cohorting is necessary: \nЬ  Only individuals who are laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases should be placed under \nmedical isolation as a cohort. Do not cohort confirmed cases with suspected cases or case \ncontacts. \nЬ  Unless no other options exist, do not house COVID-19 cases with individuals who have an undiagnosed \nrespiratory infection. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 15 of 26 \n\nCCaassee  55::1177--ccvv--0022551144--JJGGBB--SSHHKK    DDooccuummeenntt  225662--21    FFiilleedd  0044//0183//2200    PPaaggee  2246  ooff  6631    PPaaggee  IIDD \n ##::55375610 \nЬ  Ensure that cohorted cases wear face masks at all times. \no  In order of preference, individuals under medical isolation should be housed: \nЬ  Separately, in single cells with solid walls (i.e., not bars) and solid doors that close fully \nЬ  Separately, in single cells with solid walls but without solid doors \nЬ  As a cohort, in a large, well-ventilated cell with solid walls and a solid door that closes fully.

(Although individuals are in single cells in this \nscenario, the airflow between cells essentially makes it a cohort arrangement in the context of COVID-19.) \nЬ  As a cohort, in multi-person cells without solid walls or solid doors (i.e., cells enclosed entirely with bars), \npreferably with an empty cell between occupied cells. Employ social distancing strategies related to \nhousing in the Prevention section above. \nЬ  Safely transfer individual(s) to another facility with available medical isolation capacity in one of the above \narrangements \n(NOTE - Transfer should be avoided due to the potential to introduce infection to another facility; proceed \nonly if no other options are available.) \nIf the ideal choice does not exist in a facility, use the next best alternative. \n• If the number of confirmed cases exceeds the number of individual medical isolation spaces available \nin the facility, be especially mindful of cases who are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. \nIdeally, they should not be cohorted with other infected individuals. If cohorting is unavoidable, make all possible \naccommodations to prevent transmission of other infectious diseases to the higher-risk individual. (For example, \nallocate more space for a higher-risk individual within a shared medical isolation space.) \no  Persons at higher risk may include older adults and persons of any age with serious underlying medical \nconditions such as lung disease, heart disease, and diabetes. See CDC's website for a complete list, and check \nregularly for updates as more data become available to inform this issue. \nO  Note that incarcerated/detained populations have higher prevalence of infectious and chronic diseases and are \nin poorer health than the general population, even at younger ages. \n• Custody staff should be designated to monitor these individuals exclusively where possible. These staff \nshould wear recommended PPE as appropriate for their level of contact with the individual under medical isolation \n(see PPE section below) and should limit their own movement between different parts of the facility to the extent \npossible. \n•  Minimize transfer of COVID-19 cases between spaces within the healthcare unit. \n• Provide individuals under medical isolation with tissues and, if permissible, a lined no-touch trash \nreceptacle. Instruct them to: \nO  Cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when they cough or sneeze \no  Dispose of used tissues immediately in the lined trash receptacle \no  Wash hands immediately with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, \nclean hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol (where security concerns \npermit).

After cleaning: \nЬ  If the items can be laundered, launder items in accordance with the manufacturers instructions using the \nwarmest appropriate water setting for the items and then dry items completely. \nЬ  Otherwise, use products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19 Ei  and are \nsuitable for porous surfaces. \n•  Electronics cleaning and disinfection \no  For electronics such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, and remote controls, remove visible contamination if \npresent. \nЬ  Follow the manufacturer's instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products. \nЬ  Consider use of wipeable covers for electronics. \nЬ  If no manufacturer guidance is available, consider the use of alcohol-based wipes or spray containing at \nleast 70% alcohol to disinfect touch screens. Dry surfaces thoroughly to avoid pooling of liquids. \nAdditional information on cleaning and disinfection of communal facilities such can be found on CDC's website. \n•  Ensure that staff and incarcerated/detained persons performing cleaning wear recommended PPE. (See \nPPE section below.) \n•  Food service items. Cases under medical isolation should throw disposable food service items in the trash in their \nmedical isolation room. Non-disposable food service items should be handled with gloves and washed with hot \nwater or in a dishwasher. Individuals handling used food service items should clean their hands after removing \ngloves. \n•  Laundry from a COVID-19 cases can be washed with other individuals' laundry. \no  Individuals handling laundry from COVID-19 cases should wear disposable gloves, discard after each use, and \nclean their hands after. \no  Do not shake dirty laundry. This will minimize the possibility of dispersing virus through the air. \no  Launder items as appropriate in accordance with the manufacturers instructions. If possible, launder items \nusing the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely. \no  Clean and disinfect clothes hampers according to guidance above for surfaces. If permissible, consider using a \nbag liner that is either disposable or can be laundered. \n•  Consult cleaning recommendations above to ensure that transport vehicles are thoroughly cleaned \nafter carrying a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case. \nQuarantining Close Contacts of COVID-19 Cases \nNOTE: Some recommendations below apply primarily to facilities with onsite healthcare capacity. Facilities \nwithout onsite healthcare capacity, or without sufficient space to implement effective quarantine, should \ncoordinate with local public health officials to ensure that close contacts of COVID-19 cases will be \neffectively quarantined and medically monitored. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 18 of 26 \n\nCCaassee  55::1177--ccvv--0022551144--JJGGBB--SSHHKK    DDooccuummeenntt  225662--21    FFiilleedd  0044//0183//2200    PPaaggee  2279  ooff  6631    PPaaggee  IIDD \n ##::55376534 \n•  Incarcerated/detained persons who are close contacts of a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case \n(whether the case is another incarcerated/detained person, staff member, or visitor) should be placed \nunder quarantine for 14 days (see CDC guidelines). \no  If an individual is quarantined due to contact with a suspected case who is subsequently tested for COVID-19 \nand receives a negative result, the quarantined individual should be released from quarantine restrictions. \n•  In the context of COVID-19, an individual (incarcerated/detained person or staff) is considered a close \ncontact if they: \no  Have been within approximately 6 feet of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time OR \no  Have had direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g., have been coughed on) \nClose contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a common space with a COVID-19 case. Data to \ninform the definition of close contact are limited. Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of \nexposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-\n19 (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure risk, as does exposure to a severely ill patient). \n•  Keep a quarantined individual's movement outside the quarantine space to an absolute minimum. \no  Provide medical evaluation and care inside or near the quarantine space when possible. \nO  Serve meals inside the quarantine space. \no  Exclude the quarantined individual from all group activities. \no  Assign the quarantined individual a dedicated bathroom when possible. \n•  Facilities should make every possible effort to quarantine close contacts of COVID-19 cases individually. \nCohorting multiple quarantined close contacts of a COVID-19 case could transmit COVID-19 from those who are \ninfected to those who are uninfected. Cohorting should only be practiced if there are no other available options. \nO  If cohorting of close contacts under quarantine is absolutely necessary, symptoms of all individuals should be \nmonitored closely, and individuals with symptoms of COVID-19 should be placed under medical isolation \no If an entire housing unit is under quarantine due to contact with a case from the same housing unit, the entire \nhousing unit may need to be treated as a cohort and quarantine in place. \no  Some facilities may choose to quarantine all new intakes for 14 days before moving them to the facility's \ngeneral population as a general rule (not because they were exposed to a COVID-19 case). Under this scenario, \navoid mixing individuals quarantined due to exposure to a COVID-19 case with individuals undergoing routine \nintake quarantine. \no  If at all possible, do not add more individuals to an existing quarantine cohort after the 14-day quarantine clock \nhas started. \n•  If the number of quarantined individuals exceeds the number of individual quarantine spaces available \nin the facility, be especially mindful of those who are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. \nIdeally, they should not be cohorted with other quarantined individuals. If cohorting is unavoidable, make all \npossible accommodations to reduce exposure risk for the higher-risk individuals. (For example, intensify social \ndistancing strategies for higher-risk individuals.) \n•  In order of preference, multiple quarantined individuals should be housed: \no  Separately, in single cells with solid walls (i.e., not bars) and solid doors that close fully \no  Separately, in single cells with solid walls but without solid doors \no  As a cohort, in a large, well-ventilated cell with solid walls, a solid door that closes fully, and at least 6 feet of \npersonal space assigned to each individual in all directions \no  As a cohort, in a large, well-ventilated cell with solid walls and at least 6 feet of personal space assigned to each \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 19 of 26 \n\nCCaassee  55::1177--ccvv--0022551144--JJGGBB--SSHHKK    DDooccuummeenntt  225662--21    FFiilleedd  0044//0183//2200    PPaaggee  2380  ooff  6613    PPaaggee  IIDD \n ##::55376545 \nindividual in all directions, but without a solid door \no  As a cohort, in single cells without solid walls or solid doors (i.e., cells enclosed entirely with bars), preferably \nwith an empty cell between occupied cells creating at least 6 feet of space between individuals.

Employ social distancing strategies related to housing in \nthe Prevention section to maintain at least 6 feet of space between individuals housed in the same cell. \no  As a cohort, in individuals' regularly assigned housing unit but with no movement outside the unit (if an entire \nhousing unit has been exposed). Employ social distancing strategies related to housing in the Prevention \nsection above to maintain at least 6 feet of space between individuals. \no  Safely transfer to another facility with capacity to quarantine in one of the above arrangements \n(NOTE - Transfer should be avoided due to the potential to introduce infection to another facility; proceed only \nif no other options are available.) \n•  Quarantined individuals should wear face masks if feasible based on local supply, as source control, \nunder the following circumstances (see PPE section and Table 1): \no  If cohorted, quarantined individuals should wear face masks at all times (to prevent transmission from infected \nto uninfected individuals). \no  If quarantined separately, individuals should wear face masks whenever a non-quarantined individual enters \nthe quarantine space. \no  All quarantined individuals should wear a face mask if they must leave the quarantine space for any reason. \no  Asymptomatic individuals under routine intake quarantine (with no known exposure to a COVID-19 case) do \nnot need to wear face masks. \n•  Staff who have close contact with quarantined individuals should wear recommended PPE if feasible \nbased on local supply, feasibility, and safety within the scope of their duties (see PPE section and Table 1). \no  Staff supervising asymptomatic incarcerated/detained persons under routine intake quarantine (with no known \nexposure to a COVID-19 case) do not need to wear PPE. \n•  Quarantined individuals should be monitored for COVID-19 symptoms twice per day, including \ntemperature checks. \no  If an individual develops symptoms, they should be moved to medical isolation immediately and further \nevaluated. (See Medical Isolation section above.) \no  See Screening section for a procedure to perform temperature checks safely on asymptomatic close contacts of \nCOVID-19 cases. \n•  If an individual who is part of a quarantined cohort becomes symptomatic: \no  If the individual is tested for COVID-19 and tests positive: the 14-day quarantine clock for the remainder \nof the cohort must be reset to O. \no  If the individual is tested for COVID-19 and tests negative: the 14-day quarantine clock for this individual \nand the remainder of the cohort does not need to be reset. This individual can return from medical isolation to \nthe quarantined cohort for the remainder of the quarantine period. \no  If the individual is not tested for COVID-19: the 14-day quarantine clock for the remainder of the cohort \nmust be reset to 0. \n•  Restrict quarantined individuals from leaving the facility (including transfers to other facilities) during \nthe 14-day quarantine period, unless released from custody or a transfer is necessary for medical care, \ninfection control, lack of quarantine space, or extenuating security concerns. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 20 of 26 \n\nCCaassee  55::1177--ccvv--0022551144--JJGGBB--SSHHKK    DDooccuummeenntt  225662--21    FFiilleedd  0044//0183//2200    PPaaggee  2391  ooff  6631    PPaaggee  IIDD \n ##::55376556 \n•  Quarantined individuals can be released from quarantine restrictions if they have not developed \nsymptoms during the 14-day quarantine period. \n•  Meals should be provided to quarantined individuals in their quarantine spaces.

If permissible, consider using a \nbag liner that is either disposable or can be laundered. \nManagement of Incarcerated/Detained Persons with COVID-19 \nSymptoms \nNOTE: Some recommendations below apply primarily to facilities with onsite healthcare capacity. Facilities \nwithout onsite healthcare capacity or without sufficient space for medical isolation should coordinate with \nlocal public health officials to ensure that suspected COVID-19 cases will be effectively isolated, evaluated, \ntested (if indicated), and given care._ \n•  If possible, designate a room near each housing unit for healthcare staff to evaluate individuals with \nCOVID-19 symptoms, rather than having them walk through the facility to be evaluated in the medical \nunit. \n•  Incarcerated/detained individuals with COVID-19 symptoms should wear a face mask and should be \nplaced under medical isolation immediately. Discontinue the use of a face mask if it inhibits breathing. \nSee Medical Isolation section above. \n•  Medical staff should evaluate symptomatic individuals to determine whether COVID-19 testing is \nindicated. Refer to CDC guidelines for information on evaluation and testing. See Infection Control and Clinical Care \nsections below as well. \n•  If testing is indicated (or if medical staff need clarification on when testing is indicated), contact the \nstate, local, tribal, and/or territorial health department. Work with public health or private labs as \navailable to access testing supplies or services. \no  If the COVID-19 test is positive, continue medical isolation. (See Medical Isolation section above.) \no  If the COVID-19 test is negative, return the individual to their prior housing assignment unless they require \nfurther medical assessment or care. \nManagement Strategies for Incarcerated/Detained Persons without \nCOVID-19 Symptoms \n•  Provide clear information to incarcerated/detained persons about the presence of COVID-19 cases \nwithin the facility, and the need to increase social distancing and maintain hygiene precautions. \nhttps://www.cdc.govicoronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 21 of 26 \n\nCCaassee  55::1177--ccvv--0022551144--JJGGBB--SSHHKK    DDooccuummeenntt  225662--21    FFiilleedd  0044//0183//2200    PPaaggee  3302  ooff  6631    PPaaggee  IIDD \n ##::55376567 \no  Consider having healthcare staff perform regular rounds to answer questions about COVID-19. \no  Ensure that information is provided in a manner that can be understood by non-English speaking individuals \nand those with low literacy, and make necessary accommodations for those with cognitive or intellectual \ndisabilities and those who are deaf, blind, or low-vision. \n•  Implement daily temperature checks in housing units where COVID-19 cases have been identified, \nespecially if there is concern that incarcerated/detained individuals are not notifying staff of \nsymptoms.See Screening section for a procedure to safely perform a temperature check. \n• Consider additional options to intensify social distancing within the facility. \nManagement Strategies for Staff \n• Provide clear information to staff about the presence of COVID-19 cases within the facility, and the \nneed to enforce social distancing and encourage hygiene precautions. \no  Consider having healthcare staff perform regular rounds to answer questions about COVID-19 from staff. \n•  Staff identified as close contacts of a COVID-19 case should self-quarantine at home for 14 days and \nmay return to work if symptoms do not develop. \no  See above for definition of a close contact. \na  Refer to CDC guidelines for further recommendations regarding home quarantine for staff. \nInfection Control \nInfection control guidance below is applicable to all types of correctional facilities. Individual facilities \nshould assess their unique needs based on the types of exposure staff and incarcerated/detained persons \nmay have with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases. \n•  All individuals who have the potential for direct or indirect exposure to COVID-19 cases or infectious \nmaterials (including body substances; contaminated medical supplies, devices, and equipment; \ncontaminated environmental surfaces; or contaminated air) should follow infection control practices \noutlined in the CDC Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with \nSuspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings. Monitor these \nguidelines regularly for updates. \no  Implement the above guidance as fully as possible within the correctional/detention context. Some of the \nspecific language may not apply directly to healthcare settings within correctional facilities and detention \ncenters, or to facilities without onsite healthcare capacity, and may need to be adapted to reflect facility \noperations and custody needs. \no  Note that these recommendations apply to staff as well as to incarcerated/detained individuals who may come \nin contact with contaminated materials during the course of their work placement in the facility (e.g., cleaning). \n•  Staff should exercise caution when in contact with individuals showing symptoms of a respiratory \ninfection. Contact should be minimized to the extent possible until the infected individual is wearing a face mask. If \nCOVID-19 is suspected, staff should wear recommended PPE (see PPE section). \n•  Refer to PPE section to determine recommended PPE for individuals persons in contact with confirmed \nCOVID-19 cases, contacts, and potentially contaminated items. \nClinical Care of COVID-19 Cases \nhttps://www.cdc.govicoronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 22 of 26 \n\nCCaassee  55::1177--ccvv--0022551144--JJGGBB--SSHHKK    DDooccuummeenntt  225662--21    FFiilleedd  0044//0183//2200    PPaaggee  3331  ooff  6631    PPaaggee  IIDD \n ##::55376578 \n•  Facilities should ensure that incarcerated/detained individuals receive medical evaluation and \ntreatment at the first signs of COVID-19 symptoms. \no  If a facility is not able to provide such evaluation and treatment, a plan should be in place to safely transfer the \nindividual to another facility or local hospital. \no  The initial medical evaluation should determine whether a symptomatic individual is at higher risk for severe \nillness from COVID-19. Persons at higher risk may include older adults and persons of any age with serious \nunderlying medical conditions such as lung disease, heart disease, and diabetes. See CDC's website for a \ncomplete list, and check regularly for updates as more data become available to inform this issue. \n•  Staff evaluating and providing care for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases should follow the CDC \nInterim Clinical Guidance for Management of Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) \nand monitor the guidance website regularly for updates to these recommendations. \n•  Healthcare staff should evaluate persons with respiratory symptoms or contact with a COVID-19 case in \na separate room, with the door closed if possible, while wearing recommended PPE and ensuring that \nthe suspected case is wearing a face mask. \no  If possible, designate a room near each housing unit to evaluate individuals with COVID-19 symptoms, rather \nthan having them walk through the facility to be evaluated in the medical unit. \n•  Clinicians are strongly encouraged to test for other causes of respiratory illness (e.g., influenza). \n•  The facility should have a plan in place to safely transfer persons with severe illness from COVID-19 to \na local hospital if they require care beyond what the facility is able to provide. \n•  When evaluating and treating persons with symptoms of COVID-19 who do not speak English, using a \nlanguage line or provide a trained interpreter when possible. \nRecommended PPE and PPE Training for Staff and \nIncarcerated/Detained Persons \n•  Ensure that all staff (healthcare and non-healthcare) and incarcerated/detained persons who will have \ncontact with infectious materials in their work placements have been trained to correctly don, doff, and \ndispose of PPE relevant to the level of contact they will have with confirmed and suspected COVID-19 \ncases. \no  Ensure that staff and incarcerated/detained persons who require respiratory protection (e.g., N95s) for their \nwork responsibilities have been medically cleared, trained, and fit-tested in the context of an employer's \nrespiratory protection program. \no  For PPE training materials and posters, please visit the CDC website on Protecting Healthcare Personnel. \n•  Ensure that all staff are trained to perform hand hygiene after removing PPE. \n•  If administrators anticipate that incarcerated/detained persons will request unnecessary PPE, consider \nproviding training on the different types of PPE that are needed for differing degrees of contact with \nCOVID-19 cases and contacts, and the reasons for those differences (see Table 1). Monitor linked CDC \nguidelines in Table 1 for updates to recommended PPE. \n•  Keep recommended PPE near the spaces in the facility where it could be needed, to facilitate quick \naccess in an emergency. \n•  Recommended PPE for incarcerated/detained individuals and staff in a correctional facility will vary \nbased on the type of contact they have with COVID-19 cases and their contacts (see Table 1). Each type of \nrecommended PPE is defined below. As above, note that PPE shortages are anticipated in every category \nduring the COVID-19 response. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 23 of 26 \n\nCCaassee  55::1177--ccvv--0022551144--JJGGBB--SSHHKK    DDooccuummeenntt  225662--21    FFiilleedd  0044//0183//2200    PPaaggee  3324  ooff  6613    PPaaggee  IIDD \n ##::55376589 \no  N95 respirator \nSee below for guidance on when face masks are acceptable alternatives for N95s.

I am the Facility Administrator at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center \n9 \n(\"Adelanto Facility\"). I am over the age of eighteen (18), and I am competent to testify \n10 \nin this matter. My statement is based upon my personal knowledge, and my education, \n11 \ntraining, and experience. \ngog'e°' \n12 \nON  1.  The Adelanto Facility has implemented rigorous processes to avoid the \na. \nexposure of the detainee population to COVID-19 and to ensure that procedures are put \n14 \nin place to avoid the spread of COVID-19 in the event that COVID-19 were to be \n'nu°\n15 \nintroduced to the Adelanto Facility. \naRo \nFC'D \nCnZ  . 16 \n2.  To  date, there  are  no  confirmed  cases of COVID-19  in  the  Adelanto \nSa9J17 \nFacility.  At  least  five  individuals  have  been  tested  for  COVID-19  at  the \n18 \nrecommendation of medical professionals within the Adelanto Facility; all of those \n19 \ntests have been negative for COV1D-19. Our facility is in possession of additional tests \n20 \nand they will be administered consistent with  the  Center  for Disease  Control  and \n21 \nPrevention (\"CDC\") guidelines and advice of medical professionals. \n22 \n3.  Attached as Exhibit A  is a true and correct  copy of the CDC Interim \n23 \nGuidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COV1D-19) in Correctional \n24 \nand Detention  Facilities.  GEO  utilized  this  guidance  to  educate  its  personnel  and \n25 \ndetainees at the Adelanto Facility about COVID-19. GEO further utilized this guidance \n26 \nto develop its policies and practices for addressing COVID-19. My declaration below \n27 \n28  52638174;3 \n2  CASE No. 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHKx \nDECLARATION OF JAMES JANECKA IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANT THE GEO GROUP, INC.'S \nOPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-1   Filed 04/08/20   Page 4 of 62   Page ID\n #:5278\nprovides some specifics about GEO's implementation of the guidelines at Adelanto \n2  Facility. I have not attempted to describe in totality each and every action taken by the \n3  facilities and  GEO staff to  implement the guidelines or any other precautions, nor \n4  could I do so within the limitations of a publicly filed declaration. However, I hope to \n5  convey to the Court that GEO is being proactive and is taking COVID-19 seriously to \n6  reduce the risk of infection. \n7  4.  The  health,  safety,  and  well-being  of  detainees  at  Adelanto  Facility \n8  correlates with the health, safety, and well-being of GEO staff, GEO administration, \n9  and our families. Our interests are aligned with respect to mitigation strategies to slow \n10  the spread of the coronavirus and resulting infections of COVID-19. \n5.  GEO  has  held  multiple  town  hall  meetings  for  detainees,  since  the \nbeginning of March about COVID-19. These meetings include medical professionals \nP  who answer detainees' questions about COVID-19 and keep detainees aware of the \nL\nL\nN  '1'§  14  ongoing situation. Further, during my rounds of the facility, I bring a nurse with me \nA\nM\nR whenever possible to answer additional questions detainees may have. \nE\nK\nA 6.  As with all others across the country, we are continuing to evolve our \npractices  as  we  learn  more  about  COVID-19.  We  continue  to  implement \nsupplementary  safety  measures,  in  addition  to  those  listed  below,  as  information \n19  becomes available. \n20  Social Distancing and Access Limitations \n21  7.  The  Adelanto  Facility  has  implemented  a  number  of  limitations,  in \n22  connection  with  ICE,  to  reduce  the  introduction  of  any  outside  sources  of \n23  contamination into the facility. \n24  8.  Limited Visitation:  ICE has temporarily stopped all in-person visitation \n25  for detainees and their family and friends with the exception of detainees' attorney \n26  visits.  Attorneys  who  wish  to  enter  the  building  must  wear  Personal  Protective \n27 \n28  52638174;3 \n3  CASE No. 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHKx \nDECLARATION OF JAMES JANECKA IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANT THE GEO GROUP, INC.'S \nOPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-1   Filed 04/08/20   Page 5 of 62   Page ID\n #:5279\n1  Equipment  (\"PPE\")  including  an  N-95  or  surgical  masks,  goggles,  and  gloves. \n2  Otherwise, all visits are restricted to videoconferencing on tablets that are provided to \n3  detainees and telephone interviews with attorneys. \n4  9.  Anyone Entering the Adelanto  Facility:  Any individual who enters the \n5  facility  must  first  complete  a  screening  questionnaire  to  determine  whether  the \n6  individual has a likelihood of exposure to COVID-19. This includes all  GEO staff, \n7  medical staff, and other regular personnel within the building, as well as those who \n8  arrive  for  purposes  of attending  proceedings  at  the  immigration  court  within  the \n9  Adelanto Facility. Thereafter, GEO staff take the temperature of all individuals seeking \n10  entry. Anyone who presents with a fever must return home until cleared by a medical \nprofessional. Staff are not permitted to work when they are sick and are advised to stay \nhome if they develop symptoms of COVID-19 or come into contact with someone who \nhas been exposed. All staff who are potentially exposed have been instructed to follow \nCDC guidelines for self isolation and medical care. \n10.  Contractors:  Non-emergency  contractors  are  not  presently  permitted \nwithin the Adelanto facility. \n11.  Incoming Detainees: The Adelanto Facility has also placed restrictions on \nany new detainees who arrive at the facility for detention. All detainees are screened \n19  for COVID-19 exposure prior to entering the building. After a medical professional \n20  confirms that there are no clinical signs of COVID-19, and that their travel history does \n21  not raise significant concerns of exposure, each incoming detainee must undergo a \n22  minimum  of  a  fourteen-day  waiting  period  before  being  housed  in  the  general \n23  population. This procedure allows GEO to address concerns that new individuals who \n24  are asymptomatic may be carrying COVID-19. During this period, new detainees are \n25  regularly checked by medical professionals for symptoms. If a detainee were to present \n26  concerns of exposure to COVID-19 because  of his or  her symptoms, the detainee \n27 \n28  52638174;3 \n4  CASE No. 5:17-cv-02514-1GB-SHICx \nDECLARATION OF JAMES JANECKA IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANT THE GEO GROUP, INC.'S \nOPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-1   Filed 04/08/20   Page 6 of 62   Page ID\n #:5280\n1  would be placed in a negative pressure medical holding cell, or alternatively, would be \n2  denied access to the facility. All detainees who cannot verify their travel history, or \n3  who have been to areas considered \"hot spots,\" are placed immediately in  medical \n4  isolation or denied access to the facility if space is unavailable. All medically isolated \n5  individuals are checked daily by medical staff \n6  12.  Social  Distancing  within  Living  Units:  GEO  has  opened  all  units  to \n7  provide for additional space for each detainee in his or her living unit. As a result, the \n8 \ncurrent population in each pod or dorm significantly less than total capacity of each \n9  unit with an average of 55 detainees in pods that are constructed to house 80 detainees. \n10  For detainees who are in dorm-style housing, detainees are housed with ample space \n11  between them through reduced capacity. Detainees who eat their meals in the cafeteria \ntt§ift:12  now do so with significant social distancing. The chairs are arranged such that an \nFrne \nr 413  appropriate distance is maintained between detainees. Further, no more than half of \nFa \n11E1.14  any housing unit (which is already at reduced capacity) is present in the dining hall at \nr7564,L \na. taw15  any given meal time. \nrA  16  13.  Social Distancing for Other Activities:  GEO has temporarily ended all \nje):31j17  visits from volunteers to reduce the exposure to outside pathogens. Detainees may still \n18  use  the  law  library,  but  social  distancing  is  practiced  by  limiting  the  number  of \n19  individuals in the law library at any one time. Detainees may still engage in recreation \n20  but the number of individuals engaged at a time is limited to a number whereby six (6) \n21  feet of distance can be maintained between each detainee. Detainees no longer share \n22  recreation time with other housing units and instead are limited to interactions with \n23  their own housing units. Further, staff has been instructed to clean and disinfect all \n24  equipment between each use. \n25  14.  Detainees Who Leave the Facility for Medical or Other Appointments: \n26  Detainees who must attend medical appointments or immigration-case related meetings \n27 \n28  52638174;3 \n5  CASE No. 5:17-cv-02514-.1GB-SHKx \nDECLARATION OF JAMES JANECKA IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANT THE GEO GROUP, INC.'S \nOPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' EX P,4RTE APPLICATION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-1   Filed 04/08/20   Page 7 of 62   Page ID\n #:5281\n1  off of the  premises  of the  Adelanto  facility  are  immediately  placed  in  restrictive \n2  housing upon their return for a minimum of 14 days in an effort to reduce concerns the \n3  detainee could have been exposed to COVID-19 while in the community and prevent \n4  any unintended spread of the same. \n5  Enhanced Hygiene Practices \n6  15.  Supplies: I have assessed GEO's stock of soap and cleaning supplies and \n7  all supplies are stocked and not at risk of depleting in the near future. Further, there are \n8  supplies to provide hand sanitizer in strategic areas throughout the facility. I have a \n9  plan in place to keep supply stocks replenished as needed. GEO uses EPA approved \n10  cleaning products that have been demonstrated to be effective against the coronavirus, \n11  more specifically  HDQ  cleaning product  which appears on \"List N\" of the EPA's \n--, \n°R '912  approved  list  of  cleaners.  That  list  can  be  accessed  here: \n8 \nP  P, 7`71,.13  haps://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2.\nL\nL\nN  The Adelanto Facility currently has an ample supply of this cleaning product, which is \nA\nM 0Jp 15 \nR used to disinfect all hard surfaces. \nE Lugo, \nK (D. \nA 12 16  16.  Intensified  Cleaning.  GEO  has  implemented  intensified  cleaning  of \nV3  17  surfaces and objects that are frequently touched, both inside and outside of the secured \n-1 \nE-\n18  perimeter. GEO staff and contract janitors must sanitize all hard surfaces and high-\n19  touch  areas  every  hour,  including  tables,  doorknobs,  telephones.  GEO  uses  EPA-\n20  registered disinfectants that are represented to be effective against the virus that causes \n21  COVID - 19. GEO is not diluting disinfectants below effective levels. GEO has gloves \n22  for use with cleaning. Detainees have not complained about the availability of cleaning \n23  supplies. Detainees have access to additional bottles of disinfectant in their housing \n24  units. \n25  17.  Reinforced Hygiene: GEO has reinforced healthy Hygiene practices and \n26  has made supplied available to encourage safe hygiene practices. GEO plays a video \n27 \n28  52638174;3 \n6  CASE NO. 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHKx \nDECLARATION OF JAMES JANECKA IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANT THE GEO GROUP, INC.'S \nOPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-1   Filed 04/08/20   Page 8 of 62   Page ID\n #:5282\n1  on a loop in all housing areas that demonstrates the proper handwashing technique. \n2  GEO has also made the information attached as Exhibit B available to all detainees. \n_3  18.  Staff PPE Use: GEO staff have been issued surgical masks within the past \n4  week. Going forward each GEO staff member will receive three (3) masks a week with \n5  instructions for their use and disposal. \n6  19.  To my knowledge, ICE continues to release detainees who are identified \n7  as high risk as it relates to contraction of the COVID-19 virus. \n8  20.  All detainees are provided with soap and may replenish their soap anytime \n9  it runs out. There is no risk that detainees do not receive soap. \n10  I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States of America \n11  that the foregoing is true and correct and that I executed this Declaration on the 8th day \n12  of April, 2020, in Adelanto, California. \n°  14/? \n13 \n14  Janec  , Declarant \nPal \n.(5) \ncw4  ra' 15 \n00 \nQ aM 16 \n(12 \nV3017 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  52638174;3 \n7  CASE No. 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHKx \nDECLARATION OF JAMES JANECKA IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANT THE GEO GROUP, INC.'S \nOPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-1   Filed 04/08/20   Page 9 of 62   Page ID\n #:5283\nEXHIBIT A \nto Declaration of \nJames Janecka \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-1   Filed 04/08/20   Page 10 of 62   Page ID\n #:5284\nCenters for Disease \nControl and Prevention \nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) \nInterim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus \nDisease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and \nDetention Facilities \nThis interim guidance is based on what is currently known about the transmission and severity of coronavirus \ndisease 2019 (COVID-19) as of the date of posting, March 23, 2020. \nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will update this guidance as needed and as additional \ninformation becomes available. Please check the CDC website periodically for updated interim guidance. \nThis document provides interim guidance specific for correctional facilities and detention centers during the \noutbreak of COVID-19, to ensure continuation of essential public services and protection of the health and safety of \nincarcerated and detained persons, staff, and visitors. Recommendations may need to be revised as more \ninformation becomes available. \nWho is the intended audience for this guidance? \nThis document is intended to provide guiding principles for healthcare and non-healthcare administrators of correctional \nand detention facilities (including but not limited to federal and state prisons, local jails, and detention centers), law \nenforcement agencies that have custodial authority for detained populations (i.e., US Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement and US Marshals Service), and their respective health departments, to assist in preparing for potential \nintroduction, spread, and mitigation of COVID-19 in their facilities. In general, the document uses terminology referring to \ncorrectional environments but can also be applied to civil and pre-trial detention settings. \nThis guidance will not necessarily address every possible custodial setting and may not use legal terminology specific to \nindividual agencies' authorities or processes. The guidance may need to be adapted based on individual facilities' \nphysical space, staffing, population, operations, and other resources and conditions. Facilities should contact \nCDC or their state, local, territorial, and/or tribal public health department if they need assistance in applying these \nprinciples or addressing topics that are not specifically covered in this guidance. \nWhy is this guidance being issued? \nCorrectional and detention facilities can include custody, housing, education, recreation, healthcare, food service, and \nworkplace components in a single physical setting. The integration of these components presents unique challenges for \ncontrol of COVID-19 transmission among incarcerated/detained persons, staff, and visitors. Consistent application of \nspecific preparation, prevention, and management measures can help reduce the risk of transmission and severe disease \nfrom COVID-19. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 1 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-1   Filed 04/08/20   Page 11 of 62   Page ID\n #:5285\n•  Incarcerated/detained persons live, work, eat, study, and recreate within congregate environments, heightening the \npotential for COVID-19 to spread once introduced. \n•  In most cases, incarcerated/detained persons are not permitted to leave the facility. \n• There are many opportunities for COVID-19 to be introduced into a correctional or detention facility, including daily \nstaff ingress and egress; transfer of incarcerated/detained persons between facilities and systems, to court \nappearances, and to outside medical visits; and visits from family, legal representatives, and other community \nmembers. Some settings, particularly jails and detention centers, have high turnover, admitting new entrants daily \nwho may have been exposed to COVID-19 in the surrounding community or other regions. \n• Persons incarcerated/detained in a particular facility often come from a variety of locations, increasing the potential \nto introduce COVID-19 from different geographic areas. \n• Options for medical isolation of COVID-19 cases are limited and vary depending on the type and size of facility, as \nwell as the current level of available capacity, which is partly based on medical isolation needs for other conditions. \n•  Adequate levels of custody and healthcare staffing must be maintained to ensure safe operation of the facility, and \noptions to practice social distancing through work alternatives such as working from home or reduced/alternate \nschedules are limited for many staff roles. \n•  Correctional and detention facilities can be complex, multi-employer settings that include government and private \nemployers. Each is organizationally distinct and responsible for its own operational, personnel, and occupational \nhealth protocols and may be prohibited from issuing guidance or providing services to other employers or their staff \nwithin the same setting. Similarly, correctional and detention facilities may house individuals from multiple law \nenforcement agencies or jurisdictions subject to different policies and procedures. \n• Incarcerated/detained persons and staff may have medical conditions that increase their risk of severe disease from \nCOVID-19. \n•  Because limited outside information is available to many incarcerated/detained persons, unease and \nmisinformation regarding the potential for COVID-19 spread may be high, potentially creating security and morale \nchallenges. \n•  The ability of incarcerated/detained persons to exercise disease prevention measures (e.g., frequent handwashing) \nmay be limited and is determined by the supplies provided in the facility and by security considerations. Many \nfacilities restrict access to soap and paper towels and prohibit alcohol-based hand sanitizer and many disinfectants. \n•  Incarcerated persons may hesitate to report symptoms of COVID-19 or seek medical care due to co-pay \nrequirements and fear of isolation. \nCDC has issued separate COVID-19 guidance addressing healthcare infection control and clinical care of COVID-19 cases \nas well as close contacts of cases in community-based settings. Where relevant, community-focused guidance documents \nare referenced in this document and should be monitored regularly for updates, but they may require adaptation for \ncorrectional and detention settings. \nThis guidance document provides additional recommended best practices specifically for correctional and detention \nfacilities. At this time, different facility types (e.g., prison vs. jail) and sizes are not differentiated. \nAdministrators and agencies should adapt these guiding principles to the specific needs of their facility. \nWhat topics does this guidance include? \nThe guidance below includes detailed recommendations on the following topics related to COVID-19 in correctional and \ndetention settings: \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 2 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-1   Filed 04/08/20   Page 12 of 62   Page ID\n #:5286\n•  Operational and communications preparations for COVID-19 \n•  Enhanced cleaning/disinfecting and hygiene practices \n•  Social distancing strategies to increase space between individuals in the facility \n•  How to limit transmission from visitors \n• Infection control, including recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) and potential alternatives during \nPPE shortages \n•  Verbal screening and temperature check protocols for incoming incarcerated/detained individuals, staff, and visitors \n•  Medical isolation of confirmed and suspected cases and quarantine of contacts, including considerations for \ncohorting when individual spaces are limited \n•  Healthcare evaluation for suspected cases, including testing for COVID-19 \n• Clinical care for confirmed and suspected cases \n•  Considerations for persons at higher risk of severe disease from COVID-19 \nDefinitions of Commonly Used Terms \nClose contact of a COVID-19 case - In the context of COVID-19, an individual is considered a close contact if they a) \nhave been within approximately 6 feet of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time or b) have had direct contact \nwith infectious secretions from a COVID-19 case (e.g., have been coughed on). Close contact can occur while caring for, \nliving with, visiting, or sharing a common space with a COVID-19 case. Data to inform the definition of close contact are \nlimited. Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely \nincreases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure \nrisk, as does exposure to a severely ill patient). \nCohorting - Cohorting refers to the practice of isolating multiple laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases together as a \ngroup, or quarantining close contacts of a particular case together as a group. Ideally, cases should be isolated \nindividually, and close contacts should be quarantined individually. However, some correctional facilities and detention \ncenters do not have enough individual cells to do so and must consider cohorting as an alternative. See Quarantine and \nMedical Isolation sections below for specific details about ways to implement cohorting to minimize the risk of disease \nspread and adverse health outcomes. \nCommunity transmission of COVID-19 - Community transmission of COVID-19 occurs when individuals acquire the \ndisease through contact with someone in their local community, rather than through travel to an affected location. Once \ncommunity transmission is identified in a particular area, correctional facilities and detention centers are more likely to \nstart seeing cases inside their walls. Facilities should consult with local public health departments if assistance is needed \nin determining how to define \"local community\" in the context of COVID-19 spread. However, because all states have \nreported cases, all facilities should be vigilant for introduction into their populations. \nConfirmed vs. Suspected COVID-19 case - A confirmed case has received a positive result from a COVID-19 \nlaboratory test, with or without symptoms. A suspected case shows symptoms of COVID-19 but either has not been \ntested or is awaiting test results. If test results are positive, a suspected case becomes a confirmed case. \nIncarcerated/detained persons - For the purpose of this document, \"incarcerated/detained persons\" refers to persons \nheld in a prison, jail, detention center, or other custodial setting where these guidelines are generally applicable. The term \nincludes those who have been sentenced (i.e., in prisons) as well as those held for pre-trial (i.e., jails) or civil purposes (i.e, \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 3 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-1   Filed 04/08/20   Page 13 of 62   Page ID\n #:5287\ndetention centers). Although this guidance does not specifically reference individuals in every type of custodial setting \n(e.g., juvenile facilities, community confinement facilities), facility administrators can adapt this guidance to apply to their \nspecific circumstances as needed. \nMedical Isolation - Medical isolation refers to confining a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case (ideally to a single cell \nwith solid walls and a solid door that closes), to prevent contact with others and to reduce the risk of transmission. \nMedical isolation ends when the individual meets pre-established clinical and/or testing criteria for release from isolation, \nin consultation with clinical providers and public health officials (detailed in guidance below). In this context, isolation \ndoes NOT refer to punitive isolation for behavioral infractions within the custodial setting. Staff are encouraged to use the \nterm \"medical isolation\" to avoid confusion. \nQuarantine - Quarantine refers to the practice of confining individuals who have had close contact with a COVID-19 case \nto determine whether they develop symptoms of the disease. Quarantine for COVID-19 should last for a period of 14 \ndays. Ideally, each quarantined individual would be quarantined in a single cell with solid walls and a solid door that \ncloses. If symptoms develop during the 14-day period, the individual should be placed under medical isolation and \nevaluated for COVID-19. If symptoms do not develop, movement restrictions can be lifted, and the individual can return \nto their previous residency status within the facility. \nSocial Distancing - Social distancing is the practice of increasing the space between individuals and decreasing the \nfrequency of contact to reduce the risk of spreading a disease (ideally to maintain at least 6 feet between all individuals, \neven those who are asymptomatic). Social distancing strategies can be applied on an individual level (e.g., avoiding \nphysical contact), a group level (e.g., canceling group activities where individuals will be in close contact), and an \noperational level (e.g., rearranging chairs in the dining hall to increase distance between them). Although social distancing \nis challenging to practice in correctional and detention environments, it is a cornerstone of reducing transmission of \nrespiratory diseases such as COVID-19. Additional information about social distancing, including information on its use to \nreduce the spread of other viral illnesses, is available in this CDC publication El . \nStaff - In this document, \"staff\" refers to all public sector employees as well as those working for a private contractor \nwithin a correctional facility (e.g., private healthcare or food service). Except where noted, \"staff' does not distinguish \nbetween healthcare, custody, and other types of staff including private facility operators. \nSymptoms - Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Like other respiratory infections, \nCOVID-19 can vary in severity from mild to severe. When severe, pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death are possible. \nCOVID-19 is a novel disease, therefore the full range of signs and symptoms, the clinical course of the disease, and the \nindividuals and populations most at risk for disease and complications are not yet fully understood. Monitor the CDC \nwebsite for updates on these topics. \nFacilities with Limited Onsite Healthcare Services \nAlthough many large facilities such as prisons and some jails usually employ onsite healthcare staff and have the capacity \nto evaluate incarcerated/detained persons for potential illness within a dedicated healthcare space, many smaller \nfacilities do not. Some of these facilities have access to on-call healthcare staff or providers who visit the facility every few \ndays. Others have neither onsite healthcare capacity nor onsite medical isolation/quarantine space and must transfer ill \npatients to other correctional or detention facilities or local hospitals for evaluation and care. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 4 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-1   Filed 04/08/20   Page 14 of 62   Page ID\n #:5288\nThe majority of the guidance below is designed to be applied to any correctional or detention facility, either as written or \nwith modifications based on a facility's individual structure and resources. However, topics related to healthcare \nevaluation and clinical care of confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases and their close contacts may not apply directly to \nfacilities with limited or no onsite healthcare services. It will be especially important for these types of facilities to \ncoordinate closely with their state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health department when they encounter confirmed or \nsuspected cases among incarcerated/detained persons or staff, in order to ensure effective medical isolation and \nquarantine, necessary medical evaluation and care, and medical transfer if needed. The guidance makes note of \nstrategies tailored to facilities without onsite healthcare where possible. \nNote that all staff in any sized facility, regardless of the presence of onsite healthcare services, should observe guidance \non recommended PPE in order to ensure their own safety when interacting with confirmed and suspected COVID-19 \ncases. Facilities should make contingency plans for the likely event of PPE shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic. \nCOVID-19 Guidance for Correctional Facilities \nGuidance for correctional and detention facilities is organized into 3 sections: Operational Preparedness, Prevention, and \nManagement of COVID-19. Recommendations across these sections can be applied simultaneously based on the \nprogress of the outbreak in a particular facility and the surrounding community. \n•  Operational Preparedness. This guidance is intended to help facilities prepare for potential COVID-19 \ntransmission in the facility. Strategies focus on operational and communications planning and personnel practices. \n•  Prevention. This guidance is intended to help facilities prevent spread of COVID-19 from outside the facility to \ninside. Strategies focus on reinforcing hygiene practices, intensifying cleaning and disinfection of the facility, \nscreening (new intakes, visitors, and staff), continued communication with incarcerated/detained persons and staff, \nand social distancing measures (increasing distance between individuals). \n•  Management. This guidance is intended to help facilities clinically manage confirmed and suspected COVID-19 \ncases inside the facility and prevent further transmission. Strategies include medical isolation and care of \nincarcerated/detained persons with symptoms (including considerations for cohorting), quarantine of cases' close \ncontacts, restricting movement in and out of the facility, infection control practices for individuals interacting with \ncases and quarantined contacts or contaminated items, intensified social distancing, and cleaning and disinfecting \nareas visited by cases. \nOperational Preparedness \nAdministrators can plan and prepare for COVID-19 by ensuring that all persons in the facility know the symptoms of \nCOVID-19 and how to respond if they develop symptoms. Other essential actions include developing contingency plans \nfor reduced workforces due to absences, coordinating with public health and correctional partners, and communicating \nclearly with staff and incarcerated/detained persons about these preparations and how they may temporarily alter daily \nlife. \nCommunication & Coordination \n•  Develop information-sharing systems with partners. \no  Identify points of contact in relevant state, local, tribal, and/or territorial public health departments before \ncases develop. Actively engage with the health department to understand in advance which entity has \njurisdiction to implement public health control measures for COVID-19 in a particular correctional or detention \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 5 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-1   Filed 04/08/20   Page 15 of 62   Page ID\n #:5289\nfacility. \no  Create and test communications plans to disseminate critical information to incarcerated/detained persons, \nstaff, contractors, vendors, and visitors as the pandemic progresses. \no  Communicate with other correctional facilities in the same geographic area to share information including \ndisease surveillance and absenteeism patterns among staff. \no  Where possible, put plans in place with other jurisdictions to prevent confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases \nand their close contacts from being transferred between jurisdictions and facilities unless necessary for \nmedical evaluation, medical isolation/quarantine, clinical care, extenuating security concerns, or to prevent \novercrowding. \no  Stay informed about updates to CDC guidance via the CDC COVID-19 website as more information becomes \nknown. \n• Review existing pandemic flu, all-hazards, and disaster plans, and revise for COVID-19. \no  Ensure that physical locations (dedicated housing areas and bathrooms) have been identified to isolate \nconfirmed COVID-19 cases and individuals displaying COVID-19 symptoms, and to quarantine known close \ncontacts of cases. (Medical isolation and quarantine locations should be separate). The plan should include \ncontingencies for multiple locations if numerous cases and/or contacts are identified and require medical \nisolation or quarantine simultaneously. See Medical Isolation and Quarantine sections below for details \nregarding individual medical isolation and quarantine locations (preferred) vs. cohorting. \no  Facilities without onsite healthcare capacity should make a plan for how they will ensure that suspected COVID-\n19 cases will be isolated, evaluated, tested (if indicated), and provided necessary medical care. \no  Make a list of possible social distancing strategies that could be implemented as needed at different stages of \ntransmission intensity. \no  Designate officials who will be authorized to make decisions about escalating or de-escalating response efforts \nas the epidemiologic context changes. \n•  Coordinate with local law enforcement and court officials. \no  Identify lawful alternatives to in-person court appearances, such as virtual court, as a social distancing measure \nto reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. \no  Explore strategies to prevent over-crowding of correctional and detention facilities during a community \noutbreak. \n•  Post signage throughout the facility communicating the following: \no  For all: symptoms of COVID-19 and hand hygiene instructions \no  For incarcerated/detained persons: report symptoms to staff \no  For staff: stay at home when sick; if symptoms develop while on duty, leave the facility as soon as possible and \nfollow CDC-recommended steps for persons who are ill with COVID-19 symptoms including self-isolating at \nhome, contacting their healthcare provider as soon as possible to determine whether they need to be \nevaluated and tested, and contacting their supervisor. \no  Ensure that signage is understandable for non-English speaking persons and those with low literacy, and make \nnecessary accommodations for those with cognitive or intellectual disabilities and those who are deaf, blind, or \nlow-vision. \nPersonnel Practices \n•  Review the sick leave policies of each employer that operates in the facility. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 6 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-1   Filed 04/08/20   Page 16 of 62   Page ID\n #:5290\no  Review policies to ensure that they actively encourage staff to stay home when sick. \no  If these policies do not encourage staff to stay home when sick, discuss with the contract company. \no  Determine which officials will have the authority to send symptomatic staff home. \n• Identify staff whose duties would allow them to work from home. Where possible, allowing staff to work \nfrom home can be an effective social distancing strategy to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. \no  Discuss work from home options with these staff and determine whether they have the supplies and \ntechnological equipment required to do so. \no  put systems in place to implement work from home programs (e.g., time tracking, etc.). \n• Plan for staff absences. Staff should stay home when they are sick, or they may need to stay home to care for a \nsick household member or care for children in the event of school and childcare dismissals. \no  Allow staff to work from home when possible, within the scope of their duties. \no  Identify critical job functions and plan for alternative coverage by cross-training staff where possible. \no  Determine minimum levels of staff in all categories required for the facility to function safely. If possible, \ndevelop a plan to secure additional staff if absenteeism due to COVID-19 threatens to bring staffing to \nminimum levels. \no  Consider increasing keep on person (KOP) medication orders to cover 30 days in case of healthcare staff \nshortages. \n• Consider offering revised duties to staff who are at higher risk of severe illness with COVID-19. Persons \nat higher risk may include older adults and persons of any age with serious underlying medical conditions including \nlung disease, heart disease, and diabetes. See CDC's website for a complete list, and check regularly for updates as \nmore data become available to inform this issue. \no  Facility administrators should consult with their occupational health providers to determine whether it would \nbe allowable to reassign duties for specific staff members to reduce their likelihood of exposure to COVID-19. \n•  Offer the seasonal influenza vaccine to all incarcerated/detained persons (existing population and new \nintakes) and staff throughout the influenza season. Symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of influenza. \nPreventing influenza cases in a facility can speed the detection of COVID-19 cases and reduce pressure on \nhealthcare resources. \n•  Reference the Occupational Safety and Health Administration website Cl  for recommendations \nregarding worker health. \n•  Review CDC's guidance for businesses and employers to identify any additional strategies the facility can use \nwithin its role as an employer. \nOperations & Supplies \n•  Ensure that sufficient stocks of hygiene supplies, cleaning supplies, PPE, and medical supplies \n(consistent with the healthcare capabilities of the facility) are on hand and available, and have a plan in \nplace to restock as needed if COVID-19 transmission occurs within the facility. \no  Standard medical supplies for daily clinic needs \no  Tissues \no  Liquid soap when possible. If bar soap must be used, ensure that it does not irritate the skin and thereby \nhttps://viww.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-cietention/guidance-correctional-cietention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 7 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-1   Filed 04/08/20   Page 17 of 62   Page ID\n #:5291\ndiscourage frequent hand washing. \no  Hand drying supplies \no  Alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol (where permissible based on security restrictions) \no  Cleaning supplies, including EPA-registered disinfectants effective against the virus that causes COVID-19 El \no  Recommended PPE (facemasks, N95 respirators, eye protection, disposable medical gloves, and disposable \ngowns/one-piece coveralls). See PPE section and Table 1 for more detailed information, including \nrecommendations for extending the life of all PPE categories in the event of shortages, and when face masks \nare acceptable alternatives to N95s. Visit CDC's website for a calculator to help determine rate of PPE usage. \no  Sterile viral transport media and sterile swabs to collect nasopharyngeal specimens if COVID-19 testing is \nindicated \n•  Make contingency plans for the probable event of PPE shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic, \nparticularly for non-healthcare workers. \no  See CDC guidance optimizing PPE supplies. \n•  Consider relaxing restrictions on allowing alcohol-based hand sanitizer in the secure setting where \nsecurity concerns allow. If soap and water are not available, CDC recommends cleaning hands with an alcohol-\nbased hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Consider allowing staff to carry individual-sized bottles for \ntheir personal hand hygiene while on duty. \n•  Provide a no-cost supply of soap to incarcerated/detained persons, sufficient to allow frequent_ hand \nwashing. (See Hygiene section below for additional detail regarding recommended frequency and protocol for hand \nwashing.) \no  Provide liquid soap where possible. If bar soap must be used, ensure that it does not irritate the skin and \nthereby discourage frequent hand washing. \n•  If not already in place, employers operating within the facility should establish a respiratory protection \nprogram as appropriate, to ensure that staff and incarcerated/detained persons are fit tested for any \nrespiratory protection they will need within the scope of their responsibilities. \n•  Ensure that staff and incarcerated/detained persons are trained to correctly don, doff, and dispose of \nPPE that they will need to use within the scope of their responsibilities. See Table 1 for recommended PPE \nfor incarcerated/detained persons and staff with varying levels of contact with COVID-19 cases or their close \ncontacts. \nPrevention \nCases of COVID-19 have been documented in all 50 US states. Correctional and detention facilities can prevent \nintroduction of COVID-19 from the community and reduce transmission if it is already inside by reinforcing good hygiene \npractices among incarcerated/detained persons, staff, and visitors (including increasing access to soap and paper towels), \nintensifying cleaning/disinfection practices, and implementing social distancing strategies. \nBecause many individuals infected with COVID-19 do not display symptoms, the virus could be present in facilities before \ncases are identified. Both good hygiene practices and social distancing are critical in preventing further transmission. \nOperations \nhttps://www.ccic.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 8 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-1   Filed 04/08/20   Page 18 of 62   Page ID\n #:5292\n• Stay in communication with partners about your facility's current situation. \no  State, local, territorial, and/or tribal health departments \no  Other correctional facilities \n• Communicate with the public about any changes to facility operations, including visitation programs. \n• Restrict transfers of incarcerated/detained persons to and from other jurisdictions and facilities unless \nnecessary for medical evaluation, medical isolation/quarantine, clinical care, extenuating security \nconcerns, or to prevent overcrowding. \no  Strongly consider postponing non-urgent outside medical visits. \no  If a transfer is absolutely necessary, perform verbal screening and a temperature check as outlined in the \nScreening section below, before the individual leaves the facility. If an individual does not clear the screening \nprocess, delay the transfer and follow the protocol for a suspected COVID-19 case - including putting a face \nmask on the individual, immediately placing them under medical isolation, and evaluating them for possible \nCOVID-19 testing. If the transfer must still occur, ensure that the receiving facility has capacity to properly \nisolate the individual upon arrival. Ensure that staff transporting the individual wear recommended PPE (see \nTable 1) and that the transport vehicle is cleaned thoroughly after transport. \n• Implement lawful alternatives to in-person court appearances where permissible. \n•  Where relevant, consider suspending co-pays for incarcerated/detained persons seeking medical \nevaluation for respiratory symptoms. \n•  Limit the number of operational entrances and exits to the facility. \nCleaning and Disinfecting Practices \n•  Even if COVID-19 cases have not yet been identified inside the facility or in the surrounding community, \nbegin implementing intensified cleaning and disinfecting procedures according to the \nrecommendations below. These measures may prevent spread of COVID-19 if introduced. \n•  Adhere to CDC recommendations for cleaning and disinfection during the COVID-19 response. Monitor \nthese recommendations for updates. \no  several times per day, clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that are frequently touched, especially in \ncommon areas. Such surfaces may include objects/surfaces not ordinarily cleaned daily (e.g., doorknobs, light \nswitches, sink handles, countertops, toilets, toilet handles, recreation equipment, kiosks, and telephones). \no  Staff should clean shared equipment several times per day and on a conclusion of use basis (e.g., radios, \nservice weapons, keys, handcuffs). \no  Use household cleaners and EPA-registered disinfectants effective against the virus that causes COVID-19 Cl \nas appropriate for the surface, following label instructions. This may require lifting restrictions on undiluted \ndisinfectants. \no  Labels contain instructions for safe and effective use of the cleaning product, including precautions that should \nbe taken when applying the product, such as wearing gloves and making sure there is good ventilation during \nuse \n•  Consider increasing the number of staff and/or incarcerated/detained persons trained and responsible \nfor cleaning common areas to ensure continual cleaning of these areas throughout the day. \n•  Ensure adequate supplies to support intensified cleaning and disinfection practices, and have a plan in \nplace to restock rapidly if needed. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 9 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-1   Filed 04/08/20   Page 19 of 62   Page ID\n #:5293\nHygiene \n• Reinforce healthy hygiene practices, and provide and continually restock hygiene supplies throughout \nthe facility, including in bathrooms, food preparation and dining areas, intake areas, visitor entries and \nexits, visitation rooms and waiting rooms, common areas, medical, and staff-restricted areas (e.g., \nbreak rooms). \n• Encourage all persons in the facility to take the following actions to protect themselves and others from \nCOVID-19. Post signage throughout the facility, and communicate this information verbally on a regular \nbasis. Sample signage and other communications materials are available on the CDC website. Ensure \nthat materials can be understood by non-English speakers and those with low literacy, and make necessary \naccommodations for those with cognitive or intellectual disabilities and those who are deaf, blind, or low-vision. \no  Practice good cough etiquette: Cover your mouth and nose with your elbow (or ideally with a tissue) rather \nthan with your hand when you cough or sneeze, and throw all tissues in the trash immediately after use. \no  Practice good hand hygiene: Regularly wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, \nespecially after coughing, sneezing, or blowing your nose; after using the bathroom; before eating or preparing \nfood; before taking medication; and after touching garbage. \no  Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth without cleaning your hands first. \no  Avoid sharing eating utensils, dishes, and cups. \no  Avoid non-essential physical contact. \n•  Provide incarcerated/detained persons and staff no-cost access to: \no  Soap - Provide liquid soap where possible. If bar soap must be used, ensure that it does not irritate the skin, as \nthis would discourage frequent hand washing. \no  Running water, and hand drying machines or disposable paper towels for hand washing \no  Tissues and no-touch trash receptacles for disposal \n•  Provide alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol where permissible based on security \nrestrictions. Consider allowing staff to carry individual-sized bottles to maintain hand hygiene. \n•  Communicate that sharing drugs and drug preparation equipment can spread COVID-19 due to \npotential contamination of shared items and close contact between individuals. \nPrevention Practices for Incarcerated/Detained Persons \n•  Perform pre-intake screening and temperature checks for all new entrants. Screening should take place \nin the sallyport, before beginning the intake process, in order to identify and immediately place individuals \nwith symptoms under medical isolation. See Screening section below for the wording of screening questions and a \nrecommended procedure to safely perform a temperature check. Staff performing temperature checks should wear \nrecommended PPE (see PPE section below). \no  If an individual has symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough, shortness of breath): \n■  Require the individual to wear a face mask. \n■  Ensure that staff who have direct contact with the symptomatic individual wear recommended PPE. \n■  Place the individual under medical isolation (ideally in a room near the screening location, rather than \ntransporting the ill individual through the facility), and refer to healthcare staff for further evaluation. (See \nInfection Control and Clinical Care sections below.) \n■  Facilities without onsite healthcare staff should contact their state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health \nhttps://vvviw.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 10 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-1   Filed 04/08/20   Page 20 of 62   Page ID\n #:5294\ndepartment to coordinate effective medical isolation and necessary medical care. \no  If an individual is a close contact of a known COVID-19 case (but has no COVID-19 symptoms): \n•  Quarantine the individual and monitor for symptoms two times per day for 14 days. (See Quarantine \nsection below.) \n■  Facilities without onsite healthcare staff should contact their state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health \ndepartment to coordinate effective quarantine and necessary medical care. \n• Implement social distancing strategies to increase the physical space between incarcerated/detained \npersons (ideally 6 feet between all individuals, regardless of the presence of symptoms). Strategies will \nneed to be tailored to the individual space in the facility and the needs of the population and staff. Not all strategies \nwill be feasible in all facilities. Example strategies with varying levels of intensity include: \no  Common areas: \n■  Enforce increased space between individuals in holding cells, as well as in lines and waiting areas such as \nintake (e.g., remove every other chair in a waiting area) \no  Recreation: \n■  Choose recreation spaces where individuals can spread out \n■  Stagger time in recreation spaces \n■  Restrict recreation space usage to a single housing unit per space \n(where feasible) \no  Meals: \n■  Stagger meals \n•  Rearrange seating in the dining hall so that there is more space between individuals (e.g., remove every \nother chair and use only one side of the table) \n■  Provide meals inside housing units or cells \no  Group activities: \n•  Limit the size of group activities \n•  Increase space between individuals during group activities \n■  Suspend group programs where participants are likely to be in closer contact than they are in their \nhousing environment \n■  Consider alternatives to existing group activities, in outdoor areas or other areas where individuals can \nspread out \no  Housing: \n■  If space allows, reassign bunks to provide more space between individuals, ideally 6 feet or more in all \ndirections. (Ensure that bunks are cleaned thoroughly if assigned to a new occupant.) \n■  Arrange bunks so that individuals sleep head to foot to increase the distance between them \n■  Rearrange scheduled movements to minimize mixing of individuals from different housing areas \no  Medical: \n■  If possible, designate a room near each housing unit to evaluate individuals with COVID-19 symptoms, \nrather than having them walk through the facility to be evaluated in the medical unit. If this is not feasible, \nconsider staggering sick call. \n■  Designate a room near the intake area to evaluate new entrants who are flagged by the intake screening \nprocess for COVID-19 symptoms or case contact, before they move to other parts of the facility. \n•  Communicate clearly and frequently with incarcerated/detained persons about changes to their daily \nroutine and how they can contribute to risk reduction. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 11 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-1   Filed 04/08/20   Page 21 of 62   Page ID\n #:5295\n• Note that if group activities are discontinued, it will be important to identify alternative forms of \nactivity to support the mental health of incarcerated/detained persons. \n• Consider suspending work release programs and other programs that involve movement of \nincarcerated/detained individuals in and out of the facility. \n• Provide up-to-date information about COVID-19 to incarcerated/detained persons on a regular basis, \nincluding: \no  Symptoms of COVID-19 and its health risks \no  Reminders to report COVID-19 symptoms to staff at the first sign of illness \n• Consider having healthcare staff perform rounds on a regular basis to answer questions about COVID-\n19. \nPrevention Practices for Staff \n•  Remind staff to stay at home if they are sick. Ensure that staff are aware that they will not be able to enter the \nfacility if they have symptoms of COVID-19, and that they will be expected to leave the facility as soon as possible if \nthey develop symptoms while on duty. \n•  Perform verbal screening (for COVID-19 symptoms and close contact with cases) and temperature \nchecks for all staff daily on entry. See Screening section below for wording of screening questions and a \nrecommended procedure to safely perform temperature checks. \no  In very small facilities with only a few staff, consider self-monitoring or virtual monitoring (e.g., reporting to a \ncentral authority via phone). \no  Send staff home who do not clear the screening process, and advise them to follow CDC-recommended steps \nfor persons who are ill with COVID-19 symptoms. \n• Provide staff with up-to-date information about COVID-19 and about facility policies on a regular basis, \nincluding: \no  symptoms of COVID-19 and its health risks \no  Employers' sick leave policy \no  If staff develop a fever, cough, or shortness of breath while at work: immediately put on a face mask, \ninform supervisor, leave the facility, and follow CDC-recommended steps for persons who are ill with COVID-19 \nsymptoms. \no  If staff test positive for COVID-19: inform workplace and personal contacts immediately, and do not return \nto work until a decision to discontinue home medical isolation precautions is made. Monitor CDC guidance on \ndiscontinuing home isolation regularly as circumstances evolve rapidly. \no  If a staff member is identified as a close contact of a COVID-19 case (either within the facility or in \nthe community): self-quarantine at home for 14 days and return to work if symptoms do not develop. If \nsymptoms do develop, follow CDC-recommended steps for persons who are ill with COVID-19 symptoms. \n• If a staff member has a confirmed COVID-19 infection, the relevant employers should inform other staff \nabout their possible exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace, but should maintain confidentiality as \nrequired by the Americans with Disabilities Act. \no  Employees who are close contacts of the case should then self-monitor for symptoms (i.e., fever, cough, or \nshortness of breath). \n•  When feasible and consistent with security priorities, encourage staff to maintain a distance of 6 feet or \nmore from an individual with respiratory symptoms while interviewing, escorting, or interacting in \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 12 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-1   Filed 04/08/20   Page 22 of 62   Page ID\n #:5296\nother ways. \n• Ask staff to keep interactions with individuals with respiratory symptoms as brief as possible. \nPrevention Practices for Visitors \n• If possible, communicate with potential visitors to discourage contact visits in the interest of their own \nhealth and the health of their family members and friends inside the facility. \n• Perform verbal screening (for COVID-19 symptoms and close contact with cases) and temperature \nchecks for all visitors and volunteers on entry. See Screening section below for wording of screening questions \nand a recommended procedure to safely perform temperature checks. \no  Staff performing temperature checks should wear recommended PPE. \no  Exclude visitors and volunteers who do not clear the screening process or who decline screening. \n•  Provide alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol in visitor entrances, exits, and waiting \nareas. \n•  Provide visitors and volunteers with information to prepare them for screening. \no  Instruct visitors to postpone their visit if they have symptoms of respiratory illness. \no  If possible, inform potential visitors and volunteers before they travel to the facility that they should expect to \nbe screened for COVID-19 (including a temperature check), and will be unable to enter the facility if they do not \nclear the screening process or if they decline screening. \no  Display signage outside visiting areas explaining the COVID-19 screening and temperature check process. \nEnsure that materials are understandable for non-English speakers and those with low literacy. \n• Promote non-contact visits: \no  Encourage incarcerated/detained persons to limit contact visits in the interest of their own health and the \nhealth of their visitors. \no  Consider reducing or temporarily eliminating the cost of phone calls for incarcerated/detained persons. \no  Consider increasing incarcerated/detained persons' telephone privileges to promote mental health and reduce \nexposure from direct contact with community visitors. \n•  Consider suspending or modifying visitation programs, if legally permissible. For example, provide \naccess to virtual visitation options where available. \no  If moving to virtual visitation, clean electronic surfaces regularly. (See Cleaning guidance below for instructions \non cleaning electronic surfaces.) \no  Inform potential visitors of changes to, or suspension of, visitation programs. \no  Clearly communicate any visitation program changes to incarcerated/detained persons, along with the reasons \nfor them (including protecting their health and their family and community members' health). \no  If suspending contact visits, provide alternate means (e.g., phone or video visitation) for incarcerated/detained \nindividuals to engage with legal representatives, clergy, and other individuals with whom they have legal right \nto consult. \nNOTE: Suspending visitation would be done in the interest of incarcerated/detained persons' physical health and the \nhealth of the general public. However, visitation is important to maintain mental health. If visitation is suspended, \nfacilities should explore alternative ways for incarcerated/detained persons to communicate with their families, friends, \nand other visitors in a way that is not financially burdensome for them. See above suggestions for promoting non-contact \nvisits. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 13 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-1   Filed 04/08/20   Page 23 of 62   Page ID\n #:5297\n•  Restrict non-essential vendors, volunteers, and tours from entering the facility. \nManagement \nIf there has been a suspected COVID-19 case inside the facility (among incarcerated/detained persons, staff, or visitors \nwho have recently been inside), begin implementing Management strategies while test results are pending. Essential \nManagement strategies include placing cases and individuals with symptoms under medical isolation, quarantining their \nclose contacts, and facilitating necessary medical care, while observing relevant infection control and environmental \ndisinfection protocols and wearing recommended PPE. \nOperations \n•  Implement alternate work arrangements deemed feasible in the Operational Preparedness \n•  Suspend all transfers of incarcerated/detained persons to and from other jurisdictions and facilities \n(including work release where relevant), unless necessary for medical evaluation, medical \nisolation/quarantine, care, extenuating security concerns, or to prevent overcrowding. \no  If a transfer is absolutely necessary, perform verbal screening and a temperature check as outlined in the \nScreening section below, before the individual leaves the facility. If an individual does not clear the screening \nprocess, delay the transfer and follow the protocol for a suspected COVID-19 case - including putting a face \nmask on the individual, immediately placing them under medical isolation, and evaluating them for possible \nCOVID-19 testing. If the transfer must still occur, ensure that the receiving facility has capacity to appropriately \nisolate the individual upon arrival. Ensure that staff transporting the individual wear recommended PPE (see \nTable 1) and that the transport vehicle is cleaned thoroughly after transport. \n•  If possible, consider quarantining all new intakes for 14 days before they enter the facility's general \npopulation (SEPARATELY from other individuals who are quarantined due to contact with a COVID-19 \ncase). Subsequently in this document, this practice is referred to as routine intake quarantine. \n•  When possible, arrange lawful alternatives to in-person court appearances. \n•  Incorporate screening for COVID-19 symptoms and a temperature check into release planning. \no  Screen all releasing individuals for COVID-19 symptoms and perform a temperature check. (See Screening \nsection below.) \n■ If an individual does not clear the screening process, follow the protocol for a suspected COVID-19 case \nincluding putting a face mask on the individual, immediately placing them under medical isolation, and \nevaluating them for possible COVID-19 testing. \n■ If the individual is released before the recommended medical isolation period is complete, discuss release \nof the individual with state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health departments to ensure safe medical \ntransport and continued shelter and medical care, as part of release planning. Make direct linkages to \ncommunity resources to ensure proper medical isolation and access to medical care. \n■ Before releasing an incarcerated/detained individual with COVID-19 symptoms to a community-based \nfacility, such as a homeless shelter, contact the facility's staff to ensure adequate time for them to prepare \nto continue medical isolation, or contact local public health to explore alternate housing options. \n•  Coordinate with state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health departments. \no  when a COVID-19 case is suspected, work with public health to determine action. See Medical Isolation section \nbelow. \no  When a COVID-19 case is suspected or confirmed, work with public health to identify close contacts who should \nbe placed under quarantine. See Quarantine section below. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 14 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-1   Filed 04/08/20   Page 24 of 62   Page ID\n #:5298\no  Facilities with limited onsite medical isolation, quarantine, and/or healthcare services should coordinate closely \nwith state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health departments when they encounter a confirmed or suspected \ncase, in order to ensure effective medical isolation or quarantine, necessary medical evaluation and care, and \nmedical transfer if needed. See Facilities with Limited Onsite Healthcare Services section. \nHygiene \n• Continue to ensure that hand hygiene supplies are well-stocked in all areas of the facility. (See above.) \n•  Continue to emphasize practicing good hand hygiene and cough etiquette. (See above.) \nCleaning and Disinfecting Practices \n•  Continue adhering to recommended cleaning and disinfection procedures for the facility at large. (See \nabove.) \n•  Reference specific cleaning and disinfection procedures for areas where a COVID-19 case has spent \ntime (below). \nMedical Isolation of Confirmed or Suspected COVID-19 Cases \nNOTE: Some recommendations below apply primarily to facilities with onsite healthcare capacity. Facilities \nwithout onsite healthcare capacity, or without sufficient space to implement effective medical isolation, \nshould coordinate with local public health officials to ensure that COVID-19 cases will be appropriately \nisolated, evaluated, tested (if indicated), and given care. \n•  As soon as an individual develops symptoms of COVID-19, they should wear a face mask (if it does not \nrestrict breathing) and should be immediately placed under medical isolation in a separate \nenvironment from other individuals. \n•  Keep the individual's movement outside the medical isolation space to an absolute minimum. \no  Provide medical care to cases inside the medical isolation space. See Infection Control and Clinical Care \nsections for additional details. \nServe meals to cases inside the medical isolation space. \no \nExclude the individual from all group activities. \no \no  Assign the isolated individual a dedicated bathroom when possible. \n•  Ensure that the individual is wearing a face mask at all times when outside of the medical isolation \nspace, and whenever another individual enters. Provide clean masks as needed. Masks should be changed at \nleast daily, and when visibly soiled or wet. \n•  Facilities should make every possible effort to place suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases under \nmedical isolation individually. Each isolated individual should be assigned their own housing space and \nbathroom where possible. Cohorting should only be practiced if there are no other available options. \no  If cohorting is necessary: \ns  Only individuals who are laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases should be placed under \nmedical isolation as a cohort. Do not cohort confirmed cases with suspected cases or case \ncontacts. \n■  Unless no other options exist, do not house COVID-19 cases with individuals who have an undiagnosed \nrespiratory infection. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.htrn1  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 15 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-1   Filed 04/08/20   Page 25 of 62   Page ID\n #:5299\n■ Ensure that cohorted cases wear face masks at all times. \no  In order of preference, individuals under medical isolation should be housed: \n■  Separately, in single cells with solid walls (i.e., not bars) and solid doors that close fully \n■  Separately, in single cells with solid walls but without solid doors \n■ As a cohort, in a large, well-ventilated cell with solid walls and a solid door that closes fully. Employ social \ndistancing strategies related to housing in the Prevention section above. \n■ As a cohort, in a large, well-ventilated cell with solid walls but without a solid door. Employ social \ndistancing strategies related to housing in the Prevention section above. \n■ As a cohort, in single cells without solid walls or solid doors (i.e., cells enclosed entirely with bars), \npreferably with an empty cell between occupied cells. (Although individuals are in single cells in this \nscenario, the airflow between cells essentially makes it a cohort arrangement in the context of COVID-19.) \n■ As a cohort, in multi-person cells without solid walls or solid doors (i.e., cells enclosed entirely with bars), \npreferably with an empty cell between occupied cells. Employ social distancing strategies related to \nhousing in the Prevention section above. \n■ Safely transfer individual(s) to another facility with available medical isolation capacity in one of the above \narrangements \n(NOTE - Transfer should be avoided due to the potential to introduce infection to another facility; proceed \nonly if no other options are available.) \nIf the ideal choice does not exist in a facility, use the next best alternative. \n•  If the number of confirmed cases exceeds the number of individual medical isolation spaces available \nin the facility, be especially mindful of cases who are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. \nIdeally, they should not be cohorted with other infected individuals. If cohorting is unavoidable, make all possible \naccommodations to prevent transmission of other infectious diseases to the higher-risk individual. (For example, \nallocate more space for a higher-risk individual within a shared medical isolation space.) \no  persons at higher risk may include older adults and persons of any age with serious underlying medical \nconditions such as lung disease, heart disease, and diabetes. See CDC's website for a complete list, and check \nregularly for updates as more data become available to inform this issue. \no  Note that incarcerated/detained populations have higher prevalence of infectious and chronic diseases and are \nin poorer health than the general population, even at younger ages. \n•  Custody staff should be designated to monitor these individuals exclusively where possible. These staff \nshould wear recommended PPE as appropriate for their level of contact with the individual under medical isolation \n(see PPE section below) and should limit their own movement between different parts of the facility to the extent \npossible. \n•  Minimize transfer of COVID-19 cases between spaces within the healthcare unit. \n•  Provide individuals under medical isolation with tissues and, if permissible, a lined no-touch trash \nreceptacle. Instruct them to: \no  cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when they cough or sneeze \no  Dispose of used tissues immediately in the lined trash receptacle \no  Wash hands immediately with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, \nclean hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol (where security concerns \npermit). Ensure that hand washing supplies are continually restocked. \n•  Maintain medical isolation until all the following criteria have been met.

Refer to the Definitions \nsection for the distinction between confirmed and suspected cases. \no  Close off areas used by the infected individual. If possible, open outside doors and windows to increase air \ncirculation in the area. Wait as long as practical, up to 24 hours under the poorest air exchange conditions \n(consult CDC Guidelines for Environmental Infection Control in Health-Care Facilities for wait time based on \ndifferent ventilation conditions), before beginning to clean and disinfect, to minimize potential for exposure to \nrespiratory droplets. \no  Clean and disinfect all areas (e.g., cells, bathrooms, and common areas) used by the infected individual, \nfocusing especially on frequently touched surfaces (see list above in Prevention section). \n•  Hard (non-porous) surface cleaning and disinfection \no  If surfaces are dirty, they should be cleaned using a detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection. \no  For disinfection, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants should be effective. Choose cleaning \nproducts based on security requirements within the facility. \n■  Consult a list of products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19 E  . Follow \nthe manufacturer's instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application \nmethod and contact time, etc.). \n■  Diluted household bleach solutions can be used if appropriate for the surface.

Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser. Unexpired household \nbleach will be effective against coronaviruses when properly diluted. Prepare a bleach solution by mixing: \nn  5 tablespoons (1/3rd cup) bleach per gallon of water or \n•  4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water \n• Soft (porous) surface cleaning and disinfection \no  For soft (porous) surfaces such as carpeted floors and rugs, remove visible contamination if present and clean \nwith appropriate cleaners indicated for use on these surfaces. After cleaning: \n•  If the items can be laundered, launder items in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions using the \nwarmest appropriate water setting for the items and then dry items completely. \n•  Otherwise, use products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19 Ell  and are \nsuitable for porous surfaces. \n• Electronics cleaning and disinfection \no  For electronics such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, and remote controls, remove visible contamination if \npresent. \n•  Follow the manufacturer's instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products. \n•  Consider use of wipeable covers for electronics. \n•  If no manufacturer guidance is available, consider the use of alcohol-based wipes or spray containing at \nleast 70% alcohol to disinfect touch screens. Dry surfaces thoroughly to avoid pooling of liquids. \nAdditional information on cleaning and disinfection of communal facilities such can be found on CDC's website. \n•  Ensure that staff and incarcerated/detained persons performing cleaning wear recommended PPE. (See \nPPE section below.) \n•  Food service items. Cases under medical isolation should throw disposable food service items in the trash in their \nmedical isolation room. Non-disposable food service items should be handled with gloves and washed with hot \nwater or in a dishwasher. Individuals handling used food service items should clean their hands after removing \ngloves. \n•  Laundry from a COVID-19 cases can be washed with other individuals' laundry. \no  Individuals handling laundry from COVID-19 cases should wear disposable gloves, discard after each use, and \nclean their hands after. \no  Do not shake dirty laundry. This will minimize the possibility of dispersing virus through the air. \no  Launder items as appropriate in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. If possible, launder items \nusing the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely. \no  Clean and disinfect clothes hampers according to guidance above for surfaces. If permissible, consider using a \nbag liner that is either disposable or can be laundered. \n• Consult cleaning recommendations above to ensure that transport vehicles are thoroughly cleaned \nafter carrying a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case. \nQuarantining Close Contacts of COVID-19 Cases \nNOTE: Some recommendations below apply primarily to facilities with onsite healthcare capacity. Facilities \nwithout onsite healthcare capacity, or without sufficient space to implement effective quarantine, should \ncoordinate with local public health officials to ensure that close contacts of COVID-19 cases will be \neffectively quarantined and medically monitored. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 18 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-1   Filed 04/08/20   Page 28 of 62   Page ID\n #:5302\n• Incarcerated/detained persons who are close contacts of a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case \n(whether the case is another incarcerated/detained person, staff member, or visitor) should be placed \nunder quarantine for 14 days (see CDC guidelines). \no  If an individual is quarantined due to contact with a suspected case who is subsequently tested for COVID-19 \nand receives a negative result, the quarantined individual should be released from quarantine restrictions. \n• In the context of COVID-19, an individual (incarcerated/detained person or staff) is considered a close \ncontact if they: \no  Have been within approximately 6 feet of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time OR \no  Have had direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g., have been coughed on) \nClose contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a common space with a COVID-19 case. Data to \ninform the definition of close contact are limited. Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of \nexposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-\n19 (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure risk, as does exposure to a severely ill patient). \n•  Keep a quarantined individual's movement outside the quarantine space to an absolute minimum. \no  Provide medical evaluation and care inside or near the quarantine space when possible. \no  Serve meals inside the quarantine space. \no  Exclude the quarantined individual from all group activities. \no  Assign the quarantined individual a dedicated bathroom when possible. \n•  Facilities should make every possible effort to quarantine close contacts of COVID-19 cases individually. \nCohorting multiple quarantined close contacts of a COVID-19 case could transmit COVID-19 from those who are \ninfected to those who are uninfected. Cohorting should only be practiced if there are no other available options. \no  If cohorting of close contacts under quarantine is absolutely necessary, symptoms of all individuals should be \nmonitored closely, and individuals with symptoms of COVID-19 should be placed under medical isolation \no  If an entire housing unit is under quarantine due to contact with a case from the same housing unit, the entire \nhousing unit may need to be treated as a cohort and quarantine in place. \no  some facilities may choose to quarantine all new intakes for 14 days before moving them to the facility's \ngeneral population as a general rule (not because they were exposed to a COVID-19 case). Under this scenario, \navoid mixing individuals quarantined due to exposure to a COVID-19 case with individuals undergoing routine \nintake quarantine. \no  If at all possible, do not add more individuals to an existing quarantine cohort after the 14-day quarantine clock \nhas started. \n•  If the number of quarantined individuals exceeds the number of individual quarantine spaces available \nin the facility, be especially mindful of those who are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. \nIdeally, they should not be cohorted with other quarantined individuals.

Employ social distancing strategies related to housing in the Prevention \nsection above to maintain at least 6 feet of space between individuals. \no  Safely transfer to another facility with capacity to quarantine in one of the above arrangements \n(NOTE - Transfer should be avoided due to the potential to introduce infection to another facility; proceed only \nif no other options are available.) \n• Quarantined individuals should wear face masks if feasible based on local supply, as source control, \nunder the following circumstances (see PPE section and Table 1): \no  If cohorted, quarantined individuals should wear face masks at all times (to prevent transmission from infected \nto uninfected individuals). \no  If quarantined separately, individuals should wear face masks whenever a non-quarantined individual enters \nthe quarantine space. \no  All quarantined individuals should wear a face mask if they must leave the quarantine space for any reason. \no  Asymptomatic individuals under routine intake quarantine (with no known exposure to a COVID-19 case) do \nnot need to wear face masks. \n•  Staff who have close contact with quarantined individuals should wear recommended PPE if feasible \nbased on local supply, feasibility, and safety within the scope of their duties (see PPE section and Table 1). \no  Staff supervising asymptomatic incarcerated/detained persons under routine intake quarantine (with no known \nexposure to a COVID-19 case) do not need to wear PPE. \n•  Quarantined individuals should be monitored for COVID-19 symptoms twice per day, including \ntemperature checks. \no  If an individual develops symptoms, they should be moved to medical isolation immediately and further \nevaluated. (See Medical Isolation section above.) \no  See Screening section for a procedure to perform temperature checks safely on asymptomatic close contacts of \nCOVID-19 cases. \n•  If an individual who is part of a quarantined cohort becomes symptomatic: \no  If the individual is tested for COVID-19 and tests positive: the 14-day quarantine clock for the remainder \nof the cohort must be reset to 0. \no  If the individual is tested for COVID-19 and tests negative: the 14-day quarantine clock for this individual \nand the remainder of the cohort does not need to be reset. This individual can return from medical isolation to \nthe quarantined cohort for the remainder of the quarantine period. \no  If the individual is not tested for COVID-19: the 14-day quarantine clock for the remainder of the cohort \nmust be reset to 0. \n•  Restrict quarantined individuals from leaving the facility (including transfers to other facilities) during \nthe 14-day quarantine period, unless released from custody or a transfer is necessary for medical care, \ninfection control, lack of quarantine space, or extenuating security concerns. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 20 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-1   Filed 04/08/20   Page 30 of 62   Page ID\n #:5304\n•  Quarantined individuals can be released from quarantine restrictions if they have not developed \nsymptoms during the 14-day quarantine period. \n•  Meals should be provided to quarantined individuals in their quarantine spaces. Individuals under \nquarantine should throw disposable food service items in the trash. Non-disposable food service items should be \nhandled with gloves and washed with hot water or in a dishwasher. Individuals handling used food service items \nshould clean their hands after removing gloves. \n• Laundry from quarantined individuals can be washed with other individuals' laundry. \nO  Individuals handling laundry from quarantined persons should wear disposable gloves, discard after each use, \nand clean their hands after. \no  Do not shake dirty laundry. This will minimize the possibility of dispersing virus through the air. \no  Launder items as appropriate in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. If possible, launder items \nusing the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely. \nO  Clean and disinfect clothes hampers according to guidance above for surfaces. If permissible, consider using a \nbag liner that is either disposable or can be laundered. \nManagement of Incarcerated/Detained Persons with COVID-19 \nSymptoms \nNOTE: Some recommendations below apply primarily to facilities with onsite healthcare capacity. Facilities \nwithout onsite healthcare capacity or without sufficient space for medical isolation should coordinate with \nlocal public health officials to ensure that suspected COVID-19 cases will be effectively isolated, evaluated, \ntested (if indicated), and given care._ \n• If possible, designate a room near each housing unit for healthcare staff to evaluate individuals with \nCOVID-19 symptoms, rather than having them walk through the facility to be evaluated in the medical \nunit. \n• Incarcerated/detained individuals with COVID-19 symptoms should wear a face mask and should be \nplaced under medical isolation immediately. Discontinue the use of a face mask if it inhibits breathing. \nSee Medical Isolation section above. \n• Medical staff should evaluate symptomatic individuals to determine whether COVID-19 testing is \nindicated. Refer to CDC guidelines for information on evaluation and testing. See Infection Control and Clinical Care \nsections below as well. \n• If testing is indicated (or if medical staff need clarification on when testing is indicated), contact the \nstate, local, tribal, and/or territorial health department. Work with public health or private labs as \navailable to access testing supplies or services. \no  If the COVID-19 test is positive, continue medical isolation. (See Medical Isolation section above.) \no  If the COVID-19 test is negative, return the individual to their prior housing assignment unless they require \nfurther medical assessment or care. \nManagement Strategies for Incarcerated/Detained Persons without \nCOVID-19 Symptoms \n•  Provide clear information to incarcerated/detained persons about the presence of COVID-19 cases \nwithin the facility, and the need to increase social distancing and maintain hygiene precautions. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 21 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-1   Filed 04/08/20   Page 31 of 62   Page ID\n #:5305\no  Consider having healthcare staff perform regular rounds to answer questions about COVID-19. \no  Ensure that information is provided in a manner that can be understood by non-English speaking individuals \nand those with low literacy, and make necessary accommodations for those with cognitive or intellectual \ndisabilities and those who are deaf, blind, or low-vision. \n• Implement daily temperature checks in housing units where COVID-19 cases have been identified, \nespecially if there is concern that incarcerated/detained individuals are not notifying staff of \nsymptoms.See Screening section for a procedure to safely perform a temperature check. \n• Consider additional options to intensify social distancing within the facility. \nManagement Strategies for Staff \n• Provide clear information to staff about the presence of COVID-19 cases within the facility, and the \nneed to enforce social distancing and encourage hygiene precautions. \no  Consider having healthcare staff perform regular rounds to answer questions about COVID-19 from staff. \n• Staff identified as close contacts of a COVID-19 case should self-quarantine at home for 14 days and \nmay return to work if symptoms do not develop. \no  See above for definition of a close contact. \no  Refer to CDC guidelines for further recommendations regarding home quarantine for staff. \nInfection Control \nInfection control guidance below is applicable to all types of correctional facilities. Individual facilities \nshould assess their unique needs based on the types of exposure staff and incarcerated/detained persons \nmay have with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases. \n•  All individuals who have the potential for direct or indirect exposure to COVID-19 cases or infectious \nmaterials (including body substances; contaminated medical supplies, devices, and equipment; \ncontaminated environmental surfaces; or contaminated air) should follow infection control practices \noutlined in the CDC Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with \nSuspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings. Monitor these \nguidelines regularly for updates. \no  Implement the above guidance as fully as possible within the correctional/detention context. Some of the \nspecific language may not apply directly to healthcare settings within correctional facilities and detention \ncenters, or to facilities without onsite healthcare capacity, and may need to be adapted to reflect facility \noperations and custody needs. \no  Note that these recommendations apply to staff as well as to incarcerated/detained individuals who may come \nin contact with contaminated materials during the course of their work placement in the facility (e.g., cleaning). \n•  Staff should exercise caution when in contact with individuals showing symptoms of a respiratory \ninfection. Contact should be minimized to the extent possible until the infected individual is wearing a face mask. If \nCOVID-19 is suspected, staff should wear recommended PPE (see PPE section). \n•  Refer to PPE section to determine recommended PPE for individuals persons in contact with confirmed \nCOVID-19 cases, contacts, and potentially contaminated items. \nClinical Care of COVID-19 Cases \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-cietention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 22 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-1   Filed 04/08/20   Page 32 of 62   Page ID\n #:5306\n•  Facilities should ensure that incarcerated/detained individuals receive medical evaluation and \ntreatment at the first signs of COVID-19 symptoms. \no  If a facility is not able to provide such evaluation and treatment, a plan should be in place to safely transfer the \nindividual to another facility or local hospital. \no  The initial medical evaluation should determine whether a symptomatic individual is at higher risk for severe \nillness from COVID-19. Persons at higher risk may include older adults and persons of any age with serious \nunderlying medical conditions such as lung disease, heart disease, and diabetes. See CDC's website for a \ncomplete list, and check regularly for updates as more data become available to inform this issue. \n• Staff evaluating and providing care for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases should follow the CDC \nInterim Clinical Guidance for Management of Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) \nand monitor the guidance website regularly for updates to these recommendations. \n•  Healthcare staff should evaluate persons with respiratory symptoms or contact with a COVID-19 case in \na separate room, with the door closed if possible, while wearing recommended PPE and ensuring that \nthe suspected case is wearing a face mask. \no  If possible, designate a room near each housing unit to evaluate individuals with COVID-19 symptoms, rather \nthan having them walk through the facility to be evaluated in the medical unit. \nClinicians are strongly encouraged to test for other causes of respiratory illness (e.g., influenza). \nG \n•  The facility should have a plan in place to safely transfer persons with severe illness from COVID-19 to \na local hospital if they require care beyond what the facility is able to provide. \n•  When evaluating and treating persons with symptoms of COVID-19 who do not speak English, using a \nlanguage line or provide a trained interpreter when possible. \nRecommended PPE and PPE Training for Staff and \nIncarcerated/Detained Persons \n•  Ensure that all staff (healthcare and non-healthcare) and incarcerated/detained persons who will have \ncontact with infectious materials in their work placements have been trained to correctly don, doff, and \ndispose of PPE relevant to the level of contact they will have with confirmed and suspected COVID-19 \ncases. \nEnsure that staff and incarcerated/detained persons who require respiratory protection (e.g., N95s) for their \no \nwork responsibilities have been medically cleared, trained, and fit-tested in the context of an employer's \nrespiratory protection program. \nFor PPE training materials and posters, please visit the CDC website on Protecting Healthcare Personnel. \no \n•  Ensure that all staff are trained to perform hand hygiene after removing PPE. \n•  If administrators anticipate that incarcerated/detained persons will request unnecessary PPE, consider \nproviding training on the different types of PPE that are needed for differing degrees of contact with \nCOVID-19 cases and contacts, and the reasons for those differences (see Table 1). Monitor linked CDC \nguidelines in Table 1 for updates to recommended PPE. \n•  Keep recommended PPE near the spaces in the facility where it could be needed, to facilitate quick \naccess in an emergency. \n•  Recommended PPE for incarcerated/detained individuals and staff in a correctional facility will vary \nbased on the type of contact they have with COVID-19 cases and their contacts (see Table 1). Each type of \nrecommended PPE is defined below. As above, note that PPE shortages are anticipated in every category \nduring the COVID-19 response. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 23 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-1   Filed 04/08/20   Page 33 of 62   Page ID\n #:5307\no  N95 respirator \nSee below for guidance on when face masks are acceptable alternatives for N95s.

Below, verbal screening questions for COVID-19 symptoms and \ncontact with known cases, and a safe temperature check procedure are detailed. \n• Verbal screening for symptoms of COVID-19 and contact with COVID-19 cases should include the \nfollowing questions: \no  Today or in the past 24 hours, have you had any of the following symptoms? \n■  Fever, felt feverish, or had chills? \n■  Cough? \n■  Difficulty breathing? \no  In the past 14 days, have you had contact with a person known to be infected with the novel coronavirus \n(COVID-19)? \n• The following is a protocol to safely check an individual's temperature: \no  Perform hand hygiene \no  Put on a face mask, eye protection (goggles or disposable face shield that fully covers the front and sides of the \nface), gown/coveralls, and a single pair of disposable gloves \no  Check individual's temperature \no  If performing a temperature check on multiple individuals, ensure that a clean pair of gloves is \nused for each individual and that the thermometer has been thoroughly cleaned in between each \ncheck. If disposable or non-contact thermometers are used and the screener did not have physical contact \nwith an individual, gloves do not need to be changed before the next check. If non-contact thermometers are \nused, they should be cleaned routinely as recommended by CDC for infection control. \no  Remove and discard PPE \no  perform hand hygiene \nPage last reviewed: March 23, 2020 \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 26 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-1   Filed 04/08/20   Page 36 of 62   Page ID\n #:5310\nEXHIBIT B \nto Declaration of \nJames Janecka \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-1   Filed 04/08/20   Page 37 of 62   Page ID\nCoronavirus Information for \n #:5311\nStaff and Detainees \nInformacion sobre el \ncoronavirus Para el personal y \nlos detenidos \nifrA'AfratthlitElta* \ng6ng zuo ren yuan he bei jO liu zhe guan zhueng bing du xin xi \n1-11 0(id \na?iLiA111-11),\" \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-1   Filed 04/08/20   Page 38 of 62   Page ID\n #:5312\nhands \n+hal- look. \nclean can 8.1-i11 \nJ \nhave iclai \ngerms! \ne \nr. \nGet Soap \n1„.A,ro,\n14aNdS! \n@Scrub \n• \n0 \ninse \n0 Dry \nU.S, °apartment al \nWC_ 1-tcalTh And Human 5-aryl:as \nCon Li;  r L1,5f as e \nC., wry I and Peevpnlipn \ntlynseinncid ny C.411Ci.

I am the Assistant Facility Administrator at the Aurora ICE Processing \n4 Center (“Aurora Facility” or “GEO”). I am over the age of eighteen (18), and I am \n5 competent  to  testify  in  this  matter.  My  statement  is  based  upon  my  personal \n6 knowledge, and my education, training, and experience. \n7 1.  The  Aurora  Facility  has  implemented  rigorous  processes  to  avoid  the \n8 exposure of the detainee population to COVID-19 and to ensure that procedures are put \n9 in place to avoid the spread of COVID-19 in the event that COVID-19 were to be \n10 introduced to the Aurora Facility.  \n11 2.

However, I hope to convey to the Court that GEO is being \n21 proactive and is taking COVID-19 seriously to reduce the risk of infection. \n22 3.  The  health,  safety,  and  well-being  of  detainees  at  Aurora  Facility \n23 correlates with the health, safety, and well-being of GEO staff, GEO administration, \n24 and our families. Our interests are aligned with respect to mitigation strategies to slow \n25 the spread of the coronavirus and resulting infections of COVID-19. \n26 4.  To date, a number of detainees have been tested in the facility, all of \n27 whom have tested negative for COVID-19. There is no confirmed case of COVID-19 \n28\n \n52637992;1 2  CASE NO. 5:17-CV-02514-JGB-SHKX \nDECLARATION OF DAWN CEJA IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANT THE GEO GROUP, INC.'S \nOPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-2   Filed 04/08/20   Page 4 of 61   Page ID\n #:5340\n \n1 within the Aurora Facility. Any detainee who meets the CDC criteria for testing, who \n2 is presenting a fever but has tested negative for the flu and strep, or who is otherwise \n3 recommended for testing by a medical professional is and will be tested.  \n4 5.  GEO  has  held  multiple  town  hall  meetings  for  detainees,  since  the \n5 beginning of March about COVID-19. These meetings include medical professionals \n6 who answer detainees’ questions about COVID-19 and keep detainees aware of the \n7 ongoing situation.  \n8 6.  As with all others across the country, we are continuing to evolve our \n9 practices  as  we  learn  more  about  COVID-19.  We  continue  to  implement \n10 supplementary  safety  measures,  in  addition  to  those  listed  below,  as  information \n11 becomes available.  \n2 \nE 300 0071 27-63412 Social Distancing and Access Limitations \nT96\nRMAN LLP  TH STREET, SUIS, CALIFORNIA 500 – FAX: (213)  111345 ccoonnntaemc7ti.in oant ioTwn hiitneh t oA ItChuerEo f,r aac tiolFi tayrc.e i ldiutyc e haths e iminptlreomduencttieodn  ao fn uamnyb ero  uotfs idleim  istoautirocness,   oinf  \nE FE9\nAK 601 WEST FILOS ANGELEL.: (213) 688-1167 for det8a.i neesL aimndit etdh eVir isfiatmatiiloyn :a nICd Ef rhieansd ste mwpitohr athriely e xstcoeppptieodn  aollf  idne-tpaeirnseoens ’v aisttiotartnioeny  \nT\n18 visits.

Otherwise, all \n20 visits are restricted to videoconferencing on tablets that are provided to detainees. \n21 9.  Anyone  Entering  the  Aurora  Facility:  Any  individual  who  enters  the \n22 facility  must  first  complete  a  screening  questionnaire  to  determine  whether  the \n23 individual has a likelihood of exposure to COVID-19. This includes all GEO staff, \n24 medical staff, and other regular personnel within the building, as well as those who \n25 arrive for purposes of attending proceedings at the immigration court within the Aurora \n26 Facility.  Thereafter,  GEO  staff  take  the  temperature  of  employees  before  entry. \n27 Anyone  who  presents  with  a  fever  must  return  home  until  cleared  by  a  medical \n28\n \n52637992;1 3  CASE NO. 5:17-CV-02514-JGB-SHKX \nDECLARATION OF DAWN CEJA IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANT THE GEO GROUP, INC.'S \nOPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-2   Filed 04/08/20   Page 5 of 61   Page ID\n #:5341\n \n1 professional. Staff are not permitted to work when they are sick and are advised to stay \n2 home if they develop symptoms of COVID-19 or come into contact with someone who \n3 has been exposed. All staff who are potentially exposed have been instructed to follow \n4 CDC guidelines for self isolation and medical care.    \n5 10.  Incoming Detainees: The Aurora Facility has also placed restrictions on \n6 any new detainees who arrive at the facility for detention. All detainees are screened \n7 for COVID-19 exposure prior to entering the building. After a medical professional \n8 confirms that there are no clinical signs of COVID-19, and that their travel history does \n9 not raise significant concerns of exposure, each incoming detainee must undergo a \n10 minimum of a fourteen-day waiting period before being housed in a housing unit with \n11 current detainees. This procedure allows GEO to address concerns that new individuals \n2 \nE 300 0071 27-63412 who are asymptomatic may be carrying COVID-19. During this period, new detainees \nT96\nRMAN LLP  TH STREET, SUIS, CALIFORNIA 500 – FAX: (213)  111345 athorise t porrereygs ueolnrat r blcyeo ccnahuceescernk osef d o hbfi yse  omxrp eohdseiurc rasely  pmtorpo tfCoemOssVsio, IntDhae-ls1  d9feo tera iintnheeewer   wsbyoemcualpdut sobeme  sop.f l Iafhc ieasd  d oienrt  aahi nenere egt rawatevivreeel   \nE FE9\nAK 601 WEST FILOS ANGELEL.: (213) 688-1167 pressur1e1 .m  edSicoacli ahlo lDdiinsgta ncecliln, go rw alittehrinna tLiviveilnyg,  wUounlidts :b eG dEeOni ehda asc coepses nteod t hael lf aucinliittys . to \nT\n18 provide for additional space for each detainee in his or her living unit. As a result, the \n19 current population in each pod or dorm is approximately half of the total capacity of \n20 each unit.  Further,  for  those detainees  in  pod-style  housing  units,  detainees’  cells, \n21 where they sleep, have been reduced so that no more than two detainees share a cell at \n22 a single time, allowing for six feet of distance between detainees while sleeping. For \n23 detainees  who  are  in  dorm-style  housing,  detainees  are  housed  with  ample  space \n24 between them at half or less than half of capacity. Access to common areas with \n25 television and game access has been limited to no more than 20 detainees at a time. \n26 Prior to COVID-19, those same areas would be typically occupied by 50 or more \n27 detainees. \n28\n \n52637992;1 4  CASE NO. 5:17-CV-02514-JGB-SHKX \nDECLARATION OF DAWN CEJA IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANT THE GEO GROUP, INC.'S \nOPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-2   Filed 04/08/20   Page 6 of 61   Page ID\n #:5342\n \n1 12.  Social Distancing for Other Activities: GEO has temporarily ended all \n2 visits from volunteers to reduce the exposure to outside pathogens. Detainees may still \n3 use  the  law  library,  but  social  distancing  is  practiced  by  limiting  the  number  of \n4 individuals  in  the  law  library  at  any  one  time.  Detainees  may  still  engage  in \n5 recreational activities, but the number of individuals engaged at a time is limited to a \n6 number whereby six (6) feet of distance can be maintained between each detainee. \n7 Further, all equipment is cleaned and disinfected between each use.  \n8 Enhanced Hygiene Practices \n9 13.  Supplies: I have assessed GEO’s stock of soap and cleaning supplies and \n10 all supplies are stocked and not at risk of depleting in the near future. Further, there are \n11 adequate supplies to provide hand sanitizer throughout the hallways in the facility.

Please check the CDC website periodically for updated interim guidance. \nThis document provides interim guidance specific for correctional facilities and detention centers during the \noutbreak of COVID-19, to ensure continuation of essential public services and protection of the health and safety of \nincarcerated and detained persons, staff, and visitors. Recommendations may need to be revised as more \ninformation becomes available. \nWho is the intended audience for this guidance? \nThis document is intended to provide guiding principles for healthcare and non-healthcare administrators of correctional \nand detention facilities (including but not limited to federal and state prisons, local jails, and detention centers), law \nenforcement agencies that have custodial authority for detained populations (i.e., US Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement and US Marshals Service), and their respective health departments, to assist in preparing for potential \nintroduction, spread, and mitigation of COVID-19 in their facilities. In general, the document uses terminology referring to \ncorrectional environments but can also be applied to civil and pre-trial detention settings. \nThis guidance will not necessarily address every possible custodial setting and may not use legal terminology specific to \nindividual agencies' authorities or processes. The guidance may need to be adapted based on individual facilities' \nphysical space, staffing, population, operations, and other resources and conditions. Facilities should contact \nCDC or their state, local, territorial, and/or tribal public health department if they need assistance in applying these \nprinciples or addressing topics that are not specifically covered in this guidance. \nWhy is this guidance being issued? \nCorrectional and detention facilities can include custody, housing, education, recreation, healthcare, food service, and \nworkplace components in a single physical setting. The integration of these components presents unique challenges for \ncontrol of COVID-19 transmission among incarcerated/detained persons, staff, and visitors. Consistent application of \nspecific preparation, prevention, and management measures can help reduce the risk of transmission and severe disease \nfrom COVID-19. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 1 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-2   Filed 04/08/20   Page 10 of 61   Page ID\n #:5346\n•  Incarcerated/detained persons live, work, eat, study, and recreate within congregate environments, heightening the \npotential for COVID-19 to spread once introduced. \n•  In most cases, incarcerated/detained persons are not permitted to leave the facility. \n• There are many opportunities for COVID-19 to be introduced into a correctional or detention facility, including daily \nstaff ingress and egress; transfer of incarcerated/detained persons between facilities and systems, to court \nappearances, and to outside medical visits; and visits from family, legal representatives, and other community \nmembers. Some settings, particularly jails and detention centers, have high turnover, admitting new entrants daily \nwho may have been exposed to COVID-19 in the surrounding community or other regions. \n• Persons incarcerated/detained in a particular facility often come from a variety of locations, increasing the potential \nto introduce COVID-19 from different geographic areas. \n• Options for medical isolation of COVID-19 cases are limited and vary depending on the type and size of facility, as \nwell as the current level of available capacity, which is partly based on medical isolation needs for other conditions. \n•  Adequate levels of custody and healthcare staffing must be maintained to ensure safe operation of the facility, and \noptions to practice social distancing through work alternatives such as working from home or reduced/alternate \nschedules are limited for many staff roles. \n•  Correctional and detention facilities can be complex, multi-employer settings that include government and private \nemployers. Each is organizationally distinct and responsible for its own operational, personnel, and occupational \nhealth protocols and may be prohibited from issuing guidance or providing services to other employers or their staff \nwithin the same setting. Similarly, correctional and detention facilities may house individuals from multiple law \nenforcement agencies or jurisdictions subject to different policies and procedures. \n• Incarcerated/detained persons and staff may have medical conditions that increase their risk of severe disease from \nCOVID-19. \n•  Because limited outside information is available to many incarcerated/detained persons, unease and \nmisinformation regarding the potential for COVID-19 spread may be high, potentially creating security and morale \nchallenges. \n•  The ability of incarcerated/detained persons to exercise disease prevention measures (e.g., frequent handwashing) \nmay be limited and is determined by the supplies provided in the facility and by security considerations. Many \nfacilities restrict access to soap and paper towels and prohibit alcohol-based hand sanitizer and many disinfectants. \n•  Incarcerated persons may hesitate to report symptoms of COVID-19 or seek medical care due to co-pay \nrequirements and fear of isolation. \nCDC has issued separate COVID-19 guidance addressing healthcare infection control and clinical care of COVID-19 cases \nas well as close contacts of cases in community-based settings. Where relevant, community-focused guidance documents \nare referenced in this document and should be monitored regularly for updates, but they may require adaptation for \ncorrectional and detention settings. \nThis guidance document provides additional recommended best practices specifically for correctional and detention \nfacilities. At this time, different facility types (e.g., prison vs. jail) and sizes are not differentiated. \nAdministrators and agencies should adapt these guiding principles to the specific needs of their facility. \nWhat topics does this guidance include? \nThe guidance below includes detailed recommendations on the following topics related to COVID-19 in correctional and \ndetention settings: \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 2 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-2   Filed 04/08/20   Page 11 of 61   Page ID\n #:5347\n•  Operational and communications preparations for COVID-19 \n•  Enhanced cleaning/disinfecting and hygiene practices \n•  Social distancing strategies to increase space between individuals in the facility \n•  How to limit transmission from visitors \n• Infection control, including recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) and potential alternatives during \nPPE shortages \n•  Verbal screening and temperature check protocols for incoming incarcerated/detained individuals, staff, and visitors \n•  Medical isolation of confirmed and suspected cases and quarantine of contacts, including considerations for \ncohorting when individual spaces are limited \n•  Healthcare evaluation for suspected cases, including testing for COVID-19 \n• Clinical care for confirmed and suspected cases \n•  Considerations for persons at higher risk of severe disease from COVID-19 \nDefinitions of Commonly Used Terms \nClose contact of a COVID-19 case - In the context of COVID-19, an individual is considered a close contact if they a) \nhave been within approximately 6 feet of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time or b) have had direct contact \nwith infectious secretions from a COVID-19 case (e.g., have been coughed on). Close contact can occur while caring for, \nliving with, visiting, or sharing a common space with a COVID-19 case. Data to inform the definition of close contact are \nlimited. Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely \nincreases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure \nrisk, as does exposure to a severely ill patient). \nCohorting - Cohorting refers to the practice of isolating multiple laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases together as a \ngroup, or quarantining close contacts of a particular case together as a group. Ideally, cases should be isolated \nindividually, and close contacts should be quarantined individually. However, some correctional facilities and detention \ncenters do not have enough individual cells to do so and must consider cohorting as an alternative. See Quarantine and \nMedical Isolation sections below for specific details about ways to implement cohorting to minimize the risk of disease \nspread and adverse health outcomes. \nCommunity transmission of COVID-19 - Community transmission of COVID-19 occurs when individuals acquire the \ndisease through contact with someone in their local community, rather than through travel to an affected location. Once \ncommunity transmission is identified in a particular area, correctional facilities and detention centers are more likely to \nstart seeing cases inside their walls. Facilities should consult with local public health departments if assistance is needed \nin determining how to define \"local community\" in the context of COVID-19 spread. However, because all states have \nreported cases, all facilities should be vigilant for introduction into their populations. \nConfirmed vs. Suspected COVID-19 case - A confirmed case has received a positive result from a COVID-19 \nlaboratory test, with or without symptoms. A suspected case shows symptoms of COVID-19 but either has not been \ntested or is awaiting test results. If test results are positive, a suspected case becomes a confirmed case. \nIncarcerated/detained persons - For the purpose of this document, \"incarcerated/detained persons\" refers to persons \nheld in a prison, jail, detention center, or other custodial setting where these guidelines are generally applicable. The term \nincludes those who have been sentenced (i.e., in prisons) as well as those held for pre-trial (i.e., jails) or civil purposes (i.e, \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 3 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-2   Filed 04/08/20   Page 12 of 61   Page ID\n #:5348\ndetention centers). Although this guidance does not specifically reference individuals in every type of custodial setting \n(e.g., juvenile facilities, community confinement facilities), facility administrators can adapt this guidance to apply to their \nspecific circumstances as needed. \nMedical Isolation - Medical isolation refers to confining a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case (ideally to a single cell \nwith solid walls and a solid door that closes), to prevent contact with others and to reduce the risk of transmission. \nMedical isolation ends when the individual meets pre-established clinical and/or testing criteria for release from isolation, \nin consultation with clinical providers and public health officials (detailed in guidance below). In this context, isolation \ndoes NOT refer to punitive isolation for behavioral infractions within the custodial setting. Staff are encouraged to use the \nterm \"medical isolation\" to avoid confusion. \nQuarantine - Quarantine refers to the practice of confining individuals who have had close contact with a COVID-19 case \nto determine whether they develop symptoms of the disease. Quarantine for COVID-19 should last for a period of 14 \ndays. Ideally, each quarantined individual would be quarantined in a single cell with solid walls and a solid door that \ncloses. If symptoms develop during the 14-day period, the individual should be placed under medical isolation and \nevaluated for COVID-19. If symptoms do not develop, movement restrictions can be lifted, and the individual can return \nto their previous residency status within the facility. \nSocial Distancing - Social distancing is the practice of increasing the space between individuals and decreasing the \nfrequency of contact to reduce the risk of spreading a disease (ideally to maintain at least 6 feet between all individuals, \neven those who are asymptomatic). Social distancing strategies can be applied on an individual level (e.g., avoiding \nphysical contact), a group level (e.g., canceling group activities where individuals will be in close contact), and an \noperational level (e.g., rearranging chairs in the dining hall to increase distance between them). Although social distancing \nis challenging to practice in correctional and detention environments, it is a cornerstone of reducing transmission of \nrespiratory diseases such as COVID-19. Additional information about social distancing, including information on its use to \nreduce the spread of other viral illnesses, is available in this CDC publication El . \nStaff - In this document, \"staff\" refers to all public sector employees as well as those working for a private contractor \nwithin a correctional facility (e.g., private healthcare or food service). Except where noted, \"staff' does not distinguish \nbetween healthcare, custody, and other types of staff including private facility operators. \nSymptoms - Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Like other respiratory infections, \nCOVID-19 can vary in severity from mild to severe. When severe, pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death are possible. \nCOVID-19 is a novel disease, therefore the full range of signs and symptoms, the clinical course of the disease, and the \nindividuals and populations most at risk for disease and complications are not yet fully understood. Monitor the CDC \nwebsite for updates on these topics. \nFacilities with Limited Onsite Healthcare Services \nAlthough many large facilities such as prisons and some jails usually employ onsite healthcare staff and have the capacity \nto evaluate incarcerated/detained persons for potential illness within a dedicated healthcare space, many smaller \nfacilities do not. Some of these facilities have access to on-call healthcare staff or providers who visit the facility every few \ndays. Others have neither onsite healthcare capacity nor onsite medical isolation/quarantine space and must transfer ill \npatients to other correctional or detention facilities or local hospitals for evaluation and care. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 4 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-2   Filed 04/08/20   Page 13 of 61   Page ID\n #:5349\nThe majority of the guidance below is designed to be applied to any correctional or detention facility, either as written or \nwith modifications based on a facility's individual structure and resources. However, topics related to healthcare \nevaluation and clinical care of confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases and their close contacts may not apply directly to \nfacilities with limited or no onsite healthcare services. It will be especially important for these types of facilities to \ncoordinate closely with their state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health department when they encounter confirmed or \nsuspected cases among incarcerated/detained persons or staff, in order to ensure effective medical isolation and \nquarantine, necessary medical evaluation and care, and medical transfer if needed. The guidance makes note of \nstrategies tailored to facilities without onsite healthcare where possible. \nNote that all staff in any sized facility, regardless of the presence of onsite healthcare services, should observe guidance \non recommended PPE in order to ensure their own safety when interacting with confirmed and suspected COVID-19 \ncases. Facilities should make contingency plans for the likely event of PPE shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic. \nCOVID-19 Guidance for Correctional Facilities \nGuidance for correctional and detention facilities is organized into 3 sections: Operational Preparedness, Prevention, and \nManagement of COVID-19. Recommendations across these sections can be applied simultaneously based on the \nprogress of the outbreak in a particular facility and the surrounding community. \n•  Operational Preparedness. This guidance is intended to help facilities prepare for potential COVID-19 \ntransmission in the facility. Strategies focus on operational and communications planning and personnel practices. \n•  Prevention. This guidance is intended to help facilities prevent spread of COVID-19 from outside the facility to \ninside. Strategies focus on reinforcing hygiene practices, intensifying cleaning and disinfection of the facility, \nscreening (new intakes, visitors, and staff), continued communication with incarcerated/detained persons and staff, \nand social distancing measures (increasing distance between individuals). \n•  Management. This guidance is intended to help facilities clinically manage confirmed and suspected COVID-19 \ncases inside the facility and prevent further transmission. Strategies include medical isolation and care of \nincarcerated/detained persons with symptoms (including considerations for cohorting), quarantine of cases' close \ncontacts, restricting movement in and out of the facility, infection control practices for individuals interacting with \ncases and quarantined contacts or contaminated items, intensified social distancing, and cleaning and disinfecting \nareas visited by cases. \nOperational Preparedness \nAdministrators can plan and prepare for COVID-19 by ensuring that all persons in the facility know the symptoms of \nCOVID-19 and how to respond if they develop symptoms. Other essential actions include developing contingency plans \nfor reduced workforces due to absences, coordinating with public health and correctional partners, and communicating \nclearly with staff and incarcerated/detained persons about these preparations and how they may temporarily alter daily \nlife. \nCommunication & Coordination \n•  Develop information-sharing systems with partners. \no  Identify points of contact in relevant state, local, tribal, and/or territorial public health departments before \ncases develop. Actively engage with the health department to understand in advance which entity has \njurisdiction to implement public health control measures for COVID-19 in a particular correctional or detention \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 5 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-2   Filed 04/08/20   Page 14 of 61   Page ID\n #:5350\nfacility. \no  Create and test communications plans to disseminate critical information to incarcerated/detained persons, \nstaff, contractors, vendors, and visitors as the pandemic progresses. \no  Communicate with other correctional facilities in the same geographic area to share information including \ndisease surveillance and absenteeism patterns among staff. \no  Where possible, put plans in place with other jurisdictions to prevent confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases \nand their close contacts from being transferred between jurisdictions and facilities unless necessary for \nmedical evaluation, medical isolation/quarantine, clinical care, extenuating security concerns, or to prevent \novercrowding. \no  Stay informed about updates to CDC guidance via the CDC COVID-19 website as more information becomes \nknown. \n• Review existing pandemic flu, all-hazards, and disaster plans, and revise for COVID-19. \no  Ensure that physical locations (dedicated housing areas and bathrooms) have been identified to isolate \nconfirmed COVID-19 cases and individuals displaying COVID-19 symptoms, and to quarantine known close \ncontacts of cases. (Medical isolation and quarantine locations should be separate). The plan should include \ncontingencies for multiple locations if numerous cases and/or contacts are identified and require medical \nisolation or quarantine simultaneously. See Medical Isolation and Quarantine sections below for details \nregarding individual medical isolation and quarantine locations (preferred) vs. cohorting. \no  Facilities without onsite healthcare capacity should make a plan for how they will ensure that suspected COVID-\n19 cases will be isolated, evaluated, tested (if indicated), and provided necessary medical care. \no  Make a list of possible social distancing strategies that could be implemented as needed at different stages of \ntransmission intensity. \no  Designate officials who will be authorized to make decisions about escalating or de-escalating response efforts \nas the epidemiologic context changes. \n•  Coordinate with local law enforcement and court officials. \no  Identify lawful alternatives to in-person court appearances, such as virtual court, as a social distancing measure \nto reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. \no  Explore strategies to prevent over-crowding of correctional and detention facilities during a community \noutbreak. \n•  Post signage throughout the facility communicating the following: \no  For all: symptoms of COVID-19 and hand hygiene instructions \no  For incarcerated/detained persons: report symptoms to staff \no  For staff: stay at home when sick; if symptoms develop while on duty, leave the facility as soon as possible and \nfollow CDC-recommended steps for persons who are ill with COVID-19 symptoms including self-isolating at \nhome, contacting their healthcare provider as soon as possible to determine whether they need to be \nevaluated and tested, and contacting their supervisor. \no  Ensure that signage is understandable for non-English speaking persons and those with low literacy, and make \nnecessary accommodations for those with cognitive or intellectual disabilities and those who are deaf, blind, or \nlow-vision. \nPersonnel Practices \n•  Review the sick leave policies of each employer that operates in the facility. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 6 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-2   Filed 04/08/20   Page 15 of 61   Page ID\n #:5351\no  Review policies to ensure that they actively encourage staff to stay home when sick. \no  If these policies do not encourage staff to stay home when sick, discuss with the contract company. \no  Determine which officials will have the authority to send symptomatic staff home. \n• Identify staff whose duties would allow them to work from home. Where possible, allowing staff to work \nfrom home can be an effective social distancing strategy to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. \no  Discuss work from home options with these staff and determine whether they have the supplies and \ntechnological equipment required to do so. \no  put systems in place to implement work from home programs (e.g., time tracking, etc.). \n• Plan for staff absences. Staff should stay home when they are sick, or they may need to stay home to care for a \nsick household member or care for children in the event of school and childcare dismissals. \no  Allow staff to work from home when possible, within the scope of their duties. \no  Identify critical job functions and plan for alternative coverage by cross-training staff where possible. \no  Determine minimum levels of staff in all categories required for the facility to function safely. If possible, \ndevelop a plan to secure additional staff if absenteeism due to COVID-19 threatens to bring staffing to \nminimum levels. \no  Consider increasing keep on person (KOP) medication orders to cover 30 days in case of healthcare staff \nshortages. \n• Consider offering revised duties to staff who are at higher risk of severe illness with COVID-19. Persons \nat higher risk may include older adults and persons of any age with serious underlying medical conditions including \nlung disease, heart disease, and diabetes. See CDC's website for a complete list, and check regularly for updates as \nmore data become available to inform this issue. \no  Facility administrators should consult with their occupational health providers to determine whether it would \nbe allowable to reassign duties for specific staff members to reduce their likelihood of exposure to COVID-19. \n•  Offer the seasonal influenza vaccine to all incarcerated/detained persons (existing population and new \nintakes) and staff throughout the influenza season. Symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of influenza. \nPreventing influenza cases in a facility can speed the detection of COVID-19 cases and reduce pressure on \nhealthcare resources. \n•  Reference the Occupational Safety and Health Administration website Cl  for recommendations \nregarding worker health. \n•  Review CDC's guidance for businesses and employers to identify any additional strategies the facility can use \nwithin its role as an employer. \nOperations & Supplies \n•  Ensure that sufficient stocks of hygiene supplies, cleaning supplies, PPE, and medical supplies \n(consistent with the healthcare capabilities of the facility) are on hand and available, and have a plan in \nplace to restock as needed if COVID-19 transmission occurs within the facility. \no  Standard medical supplies for daily clinic needs \no  Tissues \no  Liquid soap when possible. If bar soap must be used, ensure that it does not irritate the skin and thereby \nhttps://viww.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-cietention/guidance-correctional-cietention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 7 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-2   Filed 04/08/20   Page 16 of 61   Page ID\n #:5352\ndiscourage frequent hand washing. \no  Hand drying supplies \no  Alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol (where permissible based on security restrictions) \no  Cleaning supplies, including EPA-registered disinfectants effective against the virus that causes COVID-19 El \no  Recommended PPE (facemasks, N95 respirators, eye protection, disposable medical gloves, and disposable \ngowns/one-piece coveralls).

If soap and water are not available, CDC recommends cleaning hands with an alcohol-\nbased hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Consider allowing staff to carry individual-sized bottles for \ntheir personal hand hygiene while on duty. \n•  Provide a no-cost supply of soap to incarcerated/detained persons, sufficient to allow frequent_ hand \nwashing. (See Hygiene section below for additional detail regarding recommended frequency and protocol for hand \nwashing.) \no  Provide liquid soap where possible. If bar soap must be used, ensure that it does not irritate the skin and \nthereby discourage frequent hand washing. \n•  If not already in place, employers operating within the facility should establish a respiratory protection \nprogram as appropriate, to ensure that staff and incarcerated/detained persons are fit tested for any \nrespiratory protection they will need within the scope of their responsibilities. \n•  Ensure that staff and incarcerated/detained persons are trained to correctly don, doff, and dispose of \nPPE that they will need to use within the scope of their responsibilities. See Table 1 for recommended PPE \nfor incarcerated/detained persons and staff with varying levels of contact with COVID-19 cases or their close \ncontacts. \nPrevention \nCases of COVID-19 have been documented in all 50 US states. Correctional and detention facilities can prevent \nintroduction of COVID-19 from the community and reduce transmission if it is already inside by reinforcing good hygiene \npractices among incarcerated/detained persons, staff, and visitors (including increasing access to soap and paper towels), \nintensifying cleaning/disinfection practices, and implementing social distancing strategies. \nBecause many individuals infected with COVID-19 do not display symptoms, the virus could be present in facilities before \ncases are identified. Both good hygiene practices and social distancing are critical in preventing further transmission. \nOperations \nhttps://www.ccic.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 8 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-2   Filed 04/08/20   Page 17 of 61   Page ID\n #:5353\n• Stay in communication with partners about your facility's current situation. \no  State, local, territorial, and/or tribal health departments \no  Other correctional facilities \n• Communicate with the public about any changes to facility operations, including visitation programs. \n• Restrict transfers of incarcerated/detained persons to and from other jurisdictions and facilities unless \nnecessary for medical evaluation, medical isolation/quarantine, clinical care, extenuating security \nconcerns, or to prevent overcrowding. \no  Strongly consider postponing non-urgent outside medical visits. \no  If a transfer is absolutely necessary, perform verbal screening and a temperature check as outlined in the \nScreening section below, before the individual leaves the facility. If an individual does not clear the screening \nprocess, delay the transfer and follow the protocol for a suspected COVID-19 case - including putting a face \nmask on the individual, immediately placing them under medical isolation, and evaluating them for possible \nCOVID-19 testing. If the transfer must still occur, ensure that the receiving facility has capacity to properly \nisolate the individual upon arrival. Ensure that staff transporting the individual wear recommended PPE (see \nTable 1) and that the transport vehicle is cleaned thoroughly after transport. \n• Implement lawful alternatives to in-person court appearances where permissible. \n•  Where relevant, consider suspending co-pays for incarcerated/detained persons seeking medical \nevaluation for respiratory symptoms. \n•  Limit the number of operational entrances and exits to the facility. \nCleaning and Disinfecting Practices \n•  Even if COVID-19 cases have not yet been identified inside the facility or in the surrounding community, \nbegin implementing intensified cleaning and disinfecting procedures according to the \nrecommendations below. These measures may prevent spread of COVID-19 if introduced. \n•  Adhere to CDC recommendations for cleaning and disinfection during the COVID-19 response. Monitor \nthese recommendations for updates. \no  several times per day, clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that are frequently touched, especially in \ncommon areas. Such surfaces may include objects/surfaces not ordinarily cleaned daily (e.g., doorknobs, light \nswitches, sink handles, countertops, toilets, toilet handles, recreation equipment, kiosks, and telephones). \no  Staff should clean shared equipment several times per day and on a conclusion of use basis (e.g., radios, \nservice weapons, keys, handcuffs). \no  Use household cleaners and EPA-registered disinfectants effective against the virus that causes COVID-19 Cl \nas appropriate for the surface, following label instructions. This may require lifting restrictions on undiluted \ndisinfectants. \no  Labels contain instructions for safe and effective use of the cleaning product, including precautions that should \nbe taken when applying the product, such as wearing gloves and making sure there is good ventilation during \nuse \n•  Consider increasing the number of staff and/or incarcerated/detained persons trained and responsible \nfor cleaning common areas to ensure continual cleaning of these areas throughout the day. \n•  Ensure adequate supplies to support intensified cleaning and disinfection practices, and have a plan in \nplace to restock rapidly if needed. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 9 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-2   Filed 04/08/20   Page 18 of 61   Page ID\n #:5354\nHygiene \n• Reinforce healthy hygiene practices, and provide and continually restock hygiene supplies throughout \nthe facility, including in bathrooms, food preparation and dining areas, intake areas, visitor entries and \nexits, visitation rooms and waiting rooms, common areas, medical, and staff-restricted areas (e.g., \nbreak rooms). \n• Encourage all persons in the facility to take the following actions to protect themselves and others from \nCOVID-19. Post signage throughout the facility, and communicate this information verbally on a regular \nbasis. Sample signage and other communications materials are available on the CDC website. Ensure \nthat materials can be understood by non-English speakers and those with low literacy, and make necessary \naccommodations for those with cognitive or intellectual disabilities and those who are deaf, blind, or low-vision. \no  Practice good cough etiquette: Cover your mouth and nose with your elbow (or ideally with a tissue) rather \nthan with your hand when you cough or sneeze, and throw all tissues in the trash immediately after use. \no  Practice good hand hygiene: Regularly wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, \nespecially after coughing, sneezing, or blowing your nose; after using the bathroom; before eating or preparing \nfood; before taking medication; and after touching garbage. \no  Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth without cleaning your hands first. \no  Avoid sharing eating utensils, dishes, and cups. \no  Avoid non-essential physical contact. \n•  Provide incarcerated/detained persons and staff no-cost access to: \no  Soap - Provide liquid soap where possible. If bar soap must be used, ensure that it does not irritate the skin, as \nthis would discourage frequent hand washing. \no  Running water, and hand drying machines or disposable paper towels for hand washing \no  Tissues and no-touch trash receptacles for disposal \n•  Provide alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol where permissible based on security \nrestrictions. Consider allowing staff to carry individual-sized bottles to maintain hand hygiene. \n•  Communicate that sharing drugs and drug preparation equipment can spread COVID-19 due to \npotential contamination of shared items and close contact between individuals. \nPrevention Practices for Incarcerated/Detained Persons \n•  Perform pre-intake screening and temperature checks for all new entrants. Screening should take place \nin the sallyport, before beginning the intake process, in order to identify and immediately place individuals \nwith symptoms under medical isolation. See Screening section below for the wording of screening questions and a \nrecommended procedure to safely perform a temperature check. Staff performing temperature checks should wear \nrecommended PPE (see PPE section below). \no  If an individual has symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough, shortness of breath): \n■  Require the individual to wear a face mask. \n■  Ensure that staff who have direct contact with the symptomatic individual wear recommended PPE. \n■  Place the individual under medical isolation (ideally in a room near the screening location, rather than \ntransporting the ill individual through the facility), and refer to healthcare staff for further evaluation. (See \nInfection Control and Clinical Care sections below.) \n■  Facilities without onsite healthcare staff should contact their state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health \nhttps://vvviw.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 10 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-2   Filed 04/08/20   Page 19 of 61   Page ID\n #:5355\ndepartment to coordinate effective medical isolation and necessary medical care. \no  If an individual is a close contact of a known COVID-19 case (but has no COVID-19 symptoms): \n•  Quarantine the individual and monitor for symptoms two times per day for 14 days. (See Quarantine \nsection below.) \n■  Facilities without onsite healthcare staff should contact their state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health \ndepartment to coordinate effective quarantine and necessary medical care. \n• Implement social distancing strategies to increase the physical space between incarcerated/detained \npersons (ideally 6 feet between all individuals, regardless of the presence of symptoms). Strategies will \nneed to be tailored to the individual space in the facility and the needs of the population and staff. Not all strategies \nwill be feasible in all facilities. Example strategies with varying levels of intensity include: \no  Common areas: \n■  Enforce increased space between individuals in holding cells, as well as in lines and waiting areas such as \nintake (e.g., remove every other chair in a waiting area) \no  Recreation: \n■  Choose recreation spaces where individuals can spread out \n■  Stagger time in recreation spaces \n■  Restrict recreation space usage to a single housing unit per space \n(where feasible) \no  Meals: \n■  Stagger meals \n•  Rearrange seating in the dining hall so that there is more space between individuals (e.g., remove every \nother chair and use only one side of the table) \n■  Provide meals inside housing units or cells \no  Group activities: \n•  Limit the size of group activities \n•  Increase space between individuals during group activities \n■  Suspend group programs where participants are likely to be in closer contact than they are in their \nhousing environment \n■  Consider alternatives to existing group activities, in outdoor areas or other areas where individuals can \nspread out \no  Housing: \n■  If space allows, reassign bunks to provide more space between individuals, ideally 6 feet or more in all \ndirections. (Ensure that bunks are cleaned thoroughly if assigned to a new occupant.) \n■  Arrange bunks so that individuals sleep head to foot to increase the distance between them \n■  Rearrange scheduled movements to minimize mixing of individuals from different housing areas \no  Medical: \n■  If possible, designate a room near each housing unit to evaluate individuals with COVID-19 symptoms, \nrather than having them walk through the facility to be evaluated in the medical unit. If this is not feasible, \nconsider staggering sick call. \n■  Designate a room near the intake area to evaluate new entrants who are flagged by the intake screening \nprocess for COVID-19 symptoms or case contact, before they move to other parts of the facility. \n•  Communicate clearly and frequently with incarcerated/detained persons about changes to their daily \nroutine and how they can contribute to risk reduction. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 11 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-2   Filed 04/08/20   Page 20 of 61   Page ID\n #:5356\n• Note that if group activities are discontinued, it will be important to identify alternative forms of \nactivity to support the mental health of incarcerated/detained persons. \n• Consider suspending work release programs and other programs that involve movement of \nincarcerated/detained individuals in and out of the facility. \n• Provide up-to-date information about COVID-19 to incarcerated/detained persons on a regular basis, \nincluding: \no  Symptoms of COVID-19 and its health risks \no  Reminders to report COVID-19 symptoms to staff at the first sign of illness \n• Consider having healthcare staff perform rounds on a regular basis to answer questions about COVID-\n19. \nPrevention Practices for Staff \n•  Remind staff to stay at home if they are sick. Ensure that staff are aware that they will not be able to enter the \nfacility if they have symptoms of COVID-19, and that they will be expected to leave the facility as soon as possible if \nthey develop symptoms while on duty. \n•  Perform verbal screening (for COVID-19 symptoms and close contact with cases) and temperature \nchecks for all staff daily on entry. See Screening section below for wording of screening questions and a \nrecommended procedure to safely perform temperature checks. \no  In very small facilities with only a few staff, consider self-monitoring or virtual monitoring (e.g., reporting to a \ncentral authority via phone). \no  Send staff home who do not clear the screening process, and advise them to follow CDC-recommended steps \nfor persons who are ill with COVID-19 symptoms. \n• Provide staff with up-to-date information about COVID-19 and about facility policies on a regular basis, \nincluding: \no  symptoms of COVID-19 and its health risks \no  Employers' sick leave policy \no  If staff develop a fever, cough, or shortness of breath while at work: immediately put on a face mask, \ninform supervisor, leave the facility, and follow CDC-recommended steps for persons who are ill with COVID-19 \nsymptoms. \no  If staff test positive for COVID-19: inform workplace and personal contacts immediately, and do not return \nto work until a decision to discontinue home medical isolation precautions is made. Monitor CDC guidance on \ndiscontinuing home isolation regularly as circumstances evolve rapidly. \no  If a staff member is identified as a close contact of a COVID-19 case (either within the facility or in \nthe community): self-quarantine at home for 14 days and return to work if symptoms do not develop. If \nsymptoms do develop, follow CDC-recommended steps for persons who are ill with COVID-19 symptoms. \n• If a staff member has a confirmed COVID-19 infection, the relevant employers should inform other staff \nabout their possible exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace, but should maintain confidentiality as \nrequired by the Americans with Disabilities Act. \no  Employees who are close contacts of the case should then self-monitor for symptoms (i.e., fever, cough, or \nshortness of breath). \n•  When feasible and consistent with security priorities, encourage staff to maintain a distance of 6 feet or \nmore from an individual with respiratory symptoms while interviewing, escorting, or interacting in \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 12 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-2   Filed 04/08/20   Page 21 of 61   Page ID\n #:5357\nother ways. \n• Ask staff to keep interactions with individuals with respiratory symptoms as brief as possible. \nPrevention Practices for Visitors \n• If possible, communicate with potential visitors to discourage contact visits in the interest of their own \nhealth and the health of their family members and friends inside the facility. \n• Perform verbal screening (for COVID-19 symptoms and close contact with cases) and temperature \nchecks for all visitors and volunteers on entry. See Screening section below for wording of screening questions \nand a recommended procedure to safely perform temperature checks. \no  Staff performing temperature checks should wear recommended PPE. \no  Exclude visitors and volunteers who do not clear the screening process or who decline screening. \n•  Provide alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol in visitor entrances, exits, and waiting \nareas. \n•  Provide visitors and volunteers with information to prepare them for screening. \no  Instruct visitors to postpone their visit if they have symptoms of respiratory illness. \no  If possible, inform potential visitors and volunteers before they travel to the facility that they should expect to \nbe screened for COVID-19 (including a temperature check), and will be unable to enter the facility if they do not \nclear the screening process or if they decline screening. \no  Display signage outside visiting areas explaining the COVID-19 screening and temperature check process. \nEnsure that materials are understandable for non-English speakers and those with low literacy. \n• Promote non-contact visits: \no  Encourage incarcerated/detained persons to limit contact visits in the interest of their own health and the \nhealth of their visitors. \no  Consider reducing or temporarily eliminating the cost of phone calls for incarcerated/detained persons. \no  Consider increasing incarcerated/detained persons' telephone privileges to promote mental health and reduce \nexposure from direct contact with community visitors. \n•  Consider suspending or modifying visitation programs, if legally permissible. For example, provide \naccess to virtual visitation options where available. \no  If moving to virtual visitation, clean electronic surfaces regularly. (See Cleaning guidance below for instructions \non cleaning electronic surfaces.) \no  Inform potential visitors of changes to, or suspension of, visitation programs. \no  Clearly communicate any visitation program changes to incarcerated/detained persons, along with the reasons \nfor them (including protecting their health and their family and community members' health). \no  If suspending contact visits, provide alternate means (e.g., phone or video visitation) for incarcerated/detained \nindividuals to engage with legal representatives, clergy, and other individuals with whom they have legal right \nto consult. \nNOTE: Suspending visitation would be done in the interest of incarcerated/detained persons' physical health and the \nhealth of the general public. However, visitation is important to maintain mental health. If visitation is suspended, \nfacilities should explore alternative ways for incarcerated/detained persons to communicate with their families, friends, \nand other visitors in a way that is not financially burdensome for them. See above suggestions for promoting non-contact \nvisits. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 13 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-2   Filed 04/08/20   Page 22 of 61   Page ID\n #:5358\n•  Restrict non-essential vendors, volunteers, and tours from entering the facility. \nManagement \nIf there has been a suspected COVID-19 case inside the facility (among incarcerated/detained persons, staff, or visitors \nwho have recently been inside), begin implementing Management strategies while test results are pending. Essential \nManagement strategies include placing cases and individuals with symptoms under medical isolation, quarantining their \nclose contacts, and facilitating necessary medical care, while observing relevant infection control and environmental \ndisinfection protocols and wearing recommended PPE. \nOperations \n•  Implement alternate work arrangements deemed feasible in the Operational Preparedness \n•  Suspend all transfers of incarcerated/detained persons to and from other jurisdictions and facilities \n(including work release where relevant), unless necessary for medical evaluation, medical \nisolation/quarantine, care, extenuating security concerns, or to prevent overcrowding. \no  If a transfer is absolutely necessary, perform verbal screening and a temperature check as outlined in the \nScreening section below, before the individual leaves the facility. If an individual does not clear the screening \nprocess, delay the transfer and follow the protocol for a suspected COVID-19 case - including putting a face \nmask on the individual, immediately placing them under medical isolation, and evaluating them for possible \nCOVID-19 testing. If the transfer must still occur, ensure that the receiving facility has capacity to appropriately \nisolate the individual upon arrival. Ensure that staff transporting the individual wear recommended PPE (see \nTable 1) and that the transport vehicle is cleaned thoroughly after transport. \n•  If possible, consider quarantining all new intakes for 14 days before they enter the facility's general \npopulation (SEPARATELY from other individuals who are quarantined due to contact with a COVID-19 \ncase). Subsequently in this document, this practice is referred to as routine intake quarantine. \n•  When possible, arrange lawful alternatives to in-person court appearances. \n•  Incorporate screening for COVID-19 symptoms and a temperature check into release planning. \no  Screen all releasing individuals for COVID-19 symptoms and perform a temperature check. (See Screening \nsection below.) \n■ If an individual does not clear the screening process, follow the protocol for a suspected COVID-19 case \nincluding putting a face mask on the individual, immediately placing them under medical isolation, and \nevaluating them for possible COVID-19 testing. \n■ If the individual is released before the recommended medical isolation period is complete, discuss release \nof the individual with state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health departments to ensure safe medical \ntransport and continued shelter and medical care, as part of release planning. Make direct linkages to \ncommunity resources to ensure proper medical isolation and access to medical care. \n■ Before releasing an incarcerated/detained individual with COVID-19 symptoms to a community-based \nfacility, such as a homeless shelter, contact the facility's staff to ensure adequate time for them to prepare \nto continue medical isolation, or contact local public health to explore alternate housing options. \n•  Coordinate with state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health departments. \no  when a COVID-19 case is suspected, work with public health to determine action. See Medical Isolation section \nbelow. \no  When a COVID-19 case is suspected or confirmed, work with public health to identify close contacts who should \nbe placed under quarantine. See Quarantine section below. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 14 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-2   Filed 04/08/20   Page 23 of 61   Page ID\n #:5359\no  Facilities with limited onsite medical isolation, quarantine, and/or healthcare services should coordinate closely \nwith state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health departments when they encounter a confirmed or suspected \ncase, in order to ensure effective medical isolation or quarantine, necessary medical evaluation and care, and \nmedical transfer if needed. See Facilities with Limited Onsite Healthcare Services section. \nHygiene \n• Continue to ensure that hand hygiene supplies are well-stocked in all areas of the facility. (See above.) \n•  Continue to emphasize practicing good hand hygiene and cough etiquette. (See above.) \nCleaning and Disinfecting Practices \n•  Continue adhering to recommended cleaning and disinfection procedures for the facility at large. (See \nabove.) \n•  Reference specific cleaning and disinfection procedures for areas where a COVID-19 case has spent \ntime (below). \nMedical Isolation of Confirmed or Suspected COVID-19 Cases \nNOTE: Some recommendations below apply primarily to facilities with onsite healthcare capacity. Facilities \nwithout onsite healthcare capacity, or without sufficient space to implement effective medical isolation, \nshould coordinate with local public health officials to ensure that COVID-19 cases will be appropriately \nisolated, evaluated, tested (if indicated), and given care. \n•  As soon as an individual develops symptoms of COVID-19, they should wear a face mask (if it does not \nrestrict breathing) and should be immediately placed under medical isolation in a separate \nenvironment from other individuals. \n•  Keep the individual's movement outside the medical isolation space to an absolute minimum. \no  Provide medical care to cases inside the medical isolation space. See Infection Control and Clinical Care \nsections for additional details. \nServe meals to cases inside the medical isolation space. \no \nExclude the individual from all group activities. \no \no  Assign the isolated individual a dedicated bathroom when possible. \n•  Ensure that the individual is wearing a face mask at all times when outside of the medical isolation \nspace, and whenever another individual enters. Provide clean masks as needed. Masks should be changed at \nleast daily, and when visibly soiled or wet. \n•  Facilities should make every possible effort to place suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases under \nmedical isolation individually. Each isolated individual should be assigned their own housing space and \nbathroom where possible. Cohorting should only be practiced if there are no other available options. \no  If cohorting is necessary: \ns  Only individuals who are laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases should be placed under \nmedical isolation as a cohort. Do not cohort confirmed cases with suspected cases or case \ncontacts. \n■  Unless no other options exist, do not house COVID-19 cases with individuals who have an undiagnosed \nrespiratory infection. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.htrn1  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 15 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-2   Filed 04/08/20   Page 24 of 61   Page ID\n #:5360\n■ Ensure that cohorted cases wear face masks at all times. \no  In order of preference, individuals under medical isolation should be housed: \n■  Separately, in single cells with solid walls (i.e., not bars) and solid doors that close fully \n■  Separately, in single cells with solid walls but without solid doors \n■ As a cohort, in a large, well-ventilated cell with solid walls and a solid door that closes fully. Employ social \ndistancing strategies related to housing in the Prevention section above. \n■ As a cohort, in a large, well-ventilated cell with solid walls but without a solid door. Employ social \ndistancing strategies related to housing in the Prevention section above. \n■ As a cohort, in single cells without solid walls or solid doors (i.e., cells enclosed entirely with bars), \npreferably with an empty cell between occupied cells. (Although individuals are in single cells in this \nscenario, the airflow between cells essentially makes it a cohort arrangement in the context of COVID-19.) \n■ As a cohort, in multi-person cells without solid walls or solid doors (i.e., cells enclosed entirely with bars), \npreferably with an empty cell between occupied cells. Employ social distancing strategies related to \nhousing in the Prevention section above. \n■ Safely transfer individual(s) to another facility with available medical isolation capacity in one of the above \narrangements \n(NOTE - Transfer should be avoided due to the potential to introduce infection to another facility; proceed \nonly if no other options are available.) \nIf the ideal choice does not exist in a facility, use the next best alternative. \n•  If the number of confirmed cases exceeds the number of individual medical isolation spaces available \nin the facility, be especially mindful of cases who are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. \nIdeally, they should not be cohorted with other infected individuals. If cohorting is unavoidable, make all possible \naccommodations to prevent transmission of other infectious diseases to the higher-risk individual. (For example, \nallocate more space for a higher-risk individual within a shared medical isolation space.) \no  persons at higher risk may include older adults and persons of any age with serious underlying medical \nconditions such as lung disease, heart disease, and diabetes. See CDC's website for a complete list, and check \nregularly for updates as more data become available to inform this issue. \no  Note that incarcerated/detained populations have higher prevalence of infectious and chronic diseases and are \nin poorer health than the general population, even at younger ages. \n•  Custody staff should be designated to monitor these individuals exclusively where possible. These staff \nshould wear recommended PPE as appropriate for their level of contact with the individual under medical isolation \n(see PPE section below) and should limit their own movement between different parts of the facility to the extent \npossible. \n•  Minimize transfer of COVID-19 cases between spaces within the healthcare unit. \n•  Provide individuals under medical isolation with tissues and, if permissible, a lined no-touch trash \nreceptacle. Instruct them to: \no  cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when they cough or sneeze \no  Dispose of used tissues immediately in the lined trash receptacle \no  Wash hands immediately with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, \nclean hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol (where security concerns \npermit). Ensure that hand washing supplies are continually restocked. \n•  Maintain medical isolation until all the following criteria have been met. Monitor the CDC website for \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 16 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-2   Filed 04/08/20   Page 25 of 61   Page ID\n #:5361\nupdates to these criteria. \no  For individuals who will be tested to determine if they are still contagious: \n■ The individual has been free from fever for at least 72 hours without the use of fever-reducing \nmedications AND \n■  The individual's other symptoms have improved (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) AND \n■  The individual has tested negative in at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected at least 24 \nhours apart \no  For individuals who will NOT be tested to determine if they are still contagious: \n■  The individual has been free from fever for at least 72 hours without the use of fever-reducing \nmedications AND \n■ The individual's other symptoms have improved (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) AND \n■ At least 7 days have passed since the first symptoms appeared \no  For individuals who had a confirmed positive COVID-19 test but never showed symptoms: \n■ At least 7 days have passed since the date of the individual's first positive COVID-19 test AND \n■ The individual has had no subsequent illness \n•  Restrict cases from leaving the facility while under medical isolation precautions, unless released from \ncustody or if a transfer is necessary for medical care, infection control, lack of medical isolation space, \nor extenuating security concerns. \no  If an incarcerated/detained individual who is a COVID-19 case is released from custody during their medical \nisolation period, contact public health to arrange for safe transport and continuation of necessary medical care \nand medical isolation as part of release planning. \nCleaning Spaces where COVID-19 Cases Spent Time \n•  Thoroughly clean and disinfect all areas where the confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case spent time. \nNote — these protocols apply to suspected cases as well as confirmed cases, to ensure adequate \ndisinfection in the event that the suspected case does, in fact, have COVID-19. Refer to the Definitions \nsection for the distinction between confirmed and suspected cases. \no  Close off areas used by the infected individual. If possible, open outside doors and windows to increase air \ncirculation in the area. Wait as long as practical, up to 24 hours under the poorest air exchange conditions \n(consult CDC Guidelines for Environmental Infection Control in Health-Care Facilities for wait time based on \ndifferent ventilation conditions), before beginning to clean and disinfect, to minimize potential for exposure to \nrespiratory droplets. \no  Clean and disinfect all areas (e.g., cells, bathrooms, and common areas) used by the infected individual, \nfocusing especially on frequently touched surfaces (see list above in Prevention section). \n•  Hard (non-porous) surface cleaning and disinfection \no  If surfaces are dirty, they should be cleaned using a detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection. \no  For disinfection, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants should be effective. Choose cleaning \nproducts based on security requirements within the facility. \n■  Consult a list of products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19 E  . Follow \nthe manufacturer's instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application \nmethod and contact time, etc.). \n■  Diluted household bleach solutions can be used if appropriate for the surface.

Prepare a bleach solution by mixing: \nn  5 tablespoons (1/3rd cup) bleach per gallon of water or \n•  4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water \n• Soft (porous) surface cleaning and disinfection \no  For soft (porous) surfaces such as carpeted floors and rugs, remove visible contamination if present and clean \nwith appropriate cleaners indicated for use on these surfaces. After cleaning: \n•  If the items can be laundered, launder items in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions using the \nwarmest appropriate water setting for the items and then dry items completely. \n•  Otherwise, use products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19 Ell  and are \nsuitable for porous surfaces. \n• Electronics cleaning and disinfection \no  For electronics such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, and remote controls, remove visible contamination if \npresent. \n•  Follow the manufacturer's instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products. \n•  Consider use of wipeable covers for electronics. \n•  If no manufacturer guidance is available, consider the use of alcohol-based wipes or spray containing at \nleast 70% alcohol to disinfect touch screens. Dry surfaces thoroughly to avoid pooling of liquids. \nAdditional information on cleaning and disinfection of communal facilities such can be found on CDC's website. \n•  Ensure that staff and incarcerated/detained persons performing cleaning wear recommended PPE. (See \nPPE section below.) \n•  Food service items. Cases under medical isolation should throw disposable food service items in the trash in their \nmedical isolation room. Non-disposable food service items should be handled with gloves and washed with hot \nwater or in a dishwasher. Individuals handling used food service items should clean their hands after removing \ngloves. \n•  Laundry from a COVID-19 cases can be washed with other individuals' laundry. \no  Individuals handling laundry from COVID-19 cases should wear disposable gloves, discard after each use, and \nclean their hands after. \no  Do not shake dirty laundry. This will minimize the possibility of dispersing virus through the air. \no  Launder items as appropriate in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. If possible, launder items \nusing the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely. \no  Clean and disinfect clothes hampers according to guidance above for surfaces. If permissible, consider using a \nbag liner that is either disposable or can be laundered. \n• Consult cleaning recommendations above to ensure that transport vehicles are thoroughly cleaned \nafter carrying a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case. \nQuarantining Close Contacts of COVID-19 Cases \nNOTE: Some recommendations below apply primarily to facilities with onsite healthcare capacity. Facilities \nwithout onsite healthcare capacity, or without sufficient space to implement effective quarantine, should \ncoordinate with local public health officials to ensure that close contacts of COVID-19 cases will be \neffectively quarantined and medically monitored. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 18 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-2   Filed 04/08/20   Page 27 of 61   Page ID\n #:5363\n• Incarcerated/detained persons who are close contacts of a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case \n(whether the case is another incarcerated/detained person, staff member, or visitor) should be placed \nunder quarantine for 14 days (see CDC guidelines). \no  If an individual is quarantined due to contact with a suspected case who is subsequently tested for COVID-19 \nand receives a negative result, the quarantined individual should be released from quarantine restrictions. \n• In the context of COVID-19, an individual (incarcerated/detained person or staff) is considered a close \ncontact if they: \no  Have been within approximately 6 feet of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time OR \no  Have had direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g., have been coughed on) \nClose contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a common space with a COVID-19 case.

Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of \nexposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-\n19 (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure risk, as does exposure to a severely ill patient). \n•  Keep a quarantined individual's movement outside the quarantine space to an absolute minimum. \no  Provide medical evaluation and care inside or near the quarantine space when possible. \no  Serve meals inside the quarantine space. \no  Exclude the quarantined individual from all group activities. \no  Assign the quarantined individual a dedicated bathroom when possible. \n•  Facilities should make every possible effort to quarantine close contacts of COVID-19 cases individually. \nCohorting multiple quarantined close contacts of a COVID-19 case could transmit COVID-19 from those who are \ninfected to those who are uninfected. Cohorting should only be practiced if there are no other available options. \no  If cohorting of close contacts under quarantine is absolutely necessary, symptoms of all individuals should be \nmonitored closely, and individuals with symptoms of COVID-19 should be placed under medical isolation \no  If an entire housing unit is under quarantine due to contact with a case from the same housing unit, the entire \nhousing unit may need to be treated as a cohort and quarantine in place. \no  some facilities may choose to quarantine all new intakes for 14 days before moving them to the facility's \ngeneral population as a general rule (not because they were exposed to a COVID-19 case). Under this scenario, \navoid mixing individuals quarantined due to exposure to a COVID-19 case with individuals undergoing routine \nintake quarantine. \no  If at all possible, do not add more individuals to an existing quarantine cohort after the 14-day quarantine clock \nhas started. \n•  If the number of quarantined individuals exceeds the number of individual quarantine spaces available \nin the facility, be especially mindful of those who are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. \nIdeally, they should not be cohorted with other quarantined individuals. If cohorting is unavoidable, make all \npossible accommodations to reduce exposure risk for the higher-risk individuals. (For example, intensify social \ndistancing strategies for higher-risk individuals.) \n•  In order of preference, multiple quarantined individuals should be housed: \no  Separately, in single cells with solid walls (i.e., not bars) and solid doors that close fully \no  Separately, in single cells with solid walls but without solid doors \no  As a cohort, in a large, well-ventilated cell with solid walls, a solid door that closes fully, and at least 6 feet of \npersonal space assigned to each individual in all directions \no  As a cohort, in a large, well-ventilated cell with solid walls and at least 6 feet of personal space assigned to each \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 19 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-2   Filed 04/08/20   Page 28 of 61   Page ID\n #:5364\nindividual in all directions, but without a solid door \no  As a cohort, in single cells without solid walls or solid doors (i.e., cells enclosed entirely with bars), preferably \nwith an empty cell between occupied cells creating at least 6 feet of space between individuals. (Although \nindividuals are in single cells in this scenario, the airflow between cells essentially makes it a cohort \narrangement in the context of COVID-19.) \no  As a cohort, in multi-person cells without solid walls or solid doors (i.e., cells enclosed entirely with bars), \npreferably with an empty cell between occupied cells. Employ social distancing strategies related to housing in \nthe Prevention section to maintain at least 6 feet of space between individuals housed in the same cell. \no  As a cohort, in individuals' regularly assigned housing unit but with no movement outside the unit (if an entire \nhousing unit has been exposed). Employ social distancing strategies related to housing in the Prevention \nsection above to maintain at least 6 feet of space between individuals. \no  Safely transfer to another facility with capacity to quarantine in one of the above arrangements \n(NOTE - Transfer should be avoided due to the potential to introduce infection to another facility; proceed only \nif no other options are available.) \n• Quarantined individuals should wear face masks if feasible based on local supply, as source control, \nunder the following circumstances (see PPE section and Table 1): \no  If cohorted, quarantined individuals should wear face masks at all times (to prevent transmission from infected \nto uninfected individuals). \no  If quarantined separately, individuals should wear face masks whenever a non-quarantined individual enters \nthe quarantine space. \no  All quarantined individuals should wear a face mask if they must leave the quarantine space for any reason. \no  Asymptomatic individuals under routine intake quarantine (with no known exposure to a COVID-19 case) do \nnot need to wear face masks. \n•  Staff who have close contact with quarantined individuals should wear recommended PPE if feasible \nbased on local supply, feasibility, and safety within the scope of their duties (see PPE section and Table 1). \no  Staff supervising asymptomatic incarcerated/detained persons under routine intake quarantine (with no known \nexposure to a COVID-19 case) do not need to wear PPE. \n•  Quarantined individuals should be monitored for COVID-19 symptoms twice per day, including \ntemperature checks. \no  If an individual develops symptoms, they should be moved to medical isolation immediately and further \nevaluated. (See Medical Isolation section above.) \no  See Screening section for a procedure to perform temperature checks safely on asymptomatic close contacts of \nCOVID-19 cases. \n•  If an individual who is part of a quarantined cohort becomes symptomatic: \no  If the individual is tested for COVID-19 and tests positive: the 14-day quarantine clock for the remainder \nof the cohort must be reset to 0. \no  If the individual is tested for COVID-19 and tests negative: the 14-day quarantine clock for this individual \nand the remainder of the cohort does not need to be reset. This individual can return from medical isolation to \nthe quarantined cohort for the remainder of the quarantine period. \no  If the individual is not tested for COVID-19: the 14-day quarantine clock for the remainder of the cohort \nmust be reset to 0. \n•  Restrict quarantined individuals from leaving the facility (including transfers to other facilities) during \nthe 14-day quarantine period, unless released from custody or a transfer is necessary for medical care, \ninfection control, lack of quarantine space, or extenuating security concerns. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 20 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-2   Filed 04/08/20   Page 29 of 61   Page ID\n #:5365\n•  Quarantined individuals can be released from quarantine restrictions if they have not developed \nsymptoms during the 14-day quarantine period. \n•  Meals should be provided to quarantined individuals in their quarantine spaces. Individuals under \nquarantine should throw disposable food service items in the trash. Non-disposable food service items should be \nhandled with gloves and washed with hot water or in a dishwasher. Individuals handling used food service items \nshould clean their hands after removing gloves. \n• Laundry from quarantined individuals can be washed with other individuals' laundry. \nO  Individuals handling laundry from quarantined persons should wear disposable gloves, discard after each use, \nand clean their hands after. \no  Do not shake dirty laundry. This will minimize the possibility of dispersing virus through the air. \no  Launder items as appropriate in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. If possible, launder items \nusing the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely. \nO  Clean and disinfect clothes hampers according to guidance above for surfaces. If permissible, consider using a \nbag liner that is either disposable or can be laundered. \nManagement of Incarcerated/Detained Persons with COVID-19 \nSymptoms \nNOTE: Some recommendations below apply primarily to facilities with onsite healthcare capacity. Facilities \nwithout onsite healthcare capacity or without sufficient space for medical isolation should coordinate with \nlocal public health officials to ensure that suspected COVID-19 cases will be effectively isolated, evaluated, \ntested (if indicated), and given care._ \n• If possible, designate a room near each housing unit for healthcare staff to evaluate individuals with \nCOVID-19 symptoms, rather than having them walk through the facility to be evaluated in the medical \nunit. \n• Incarcerated/detained individuals with COVID-19 symptoms should wear a face mask and should be \nplaced under medical isolation immediately. Discontinue the use of a face mask if it inhibits breathing. \nSee Medical Isolation section above. \n• Medical staff should evaluate symptomatic individuals to determine whether COVID-19 testing is \nindicated. Refer to CDC guidelines for information on evaluation and testing. See Infection Control and Clinical Care \nsections below as well. \n• If testing is indicated (or if medical staff need clarification on when testing is indicated), contact the \nstate, local, tribal, and/or territorial health department. Work with public health or private labs as \navailable to access testing supplies or services. \no  If the COVID-19 test is positive, continue medical isolation. (See Medical Isolation section above.) \no  If the COVID-19 test is negative, return the individual to their prior housing assignment unless they require \nfurther medical assessment or care. \nManagement Strategies for Incarcerated/Detained Persons without \nCOVID-19 Symptoms \n•  Provide clear information to incarcerated/detained persons about the presence of COVID-19 cases \nwithin the facility, and the need to increase social distancing and maintain hygiene precautions. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 21 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-2   Filed 04/08/20   Page 30 of 61   Page ID\n #:5366\no  Consider having healthcare staff perform regular rounds to answer questions about COVID-19. \no  Ensure that information is provided in a manner that can be understood by non-English speaking individuals \nand those with low literacy, and make necessary accommodations for those with cognitive or intellectual \ndisabilities and those who are deaf, blind, or low-vision. \n• Implement daily temperature checks in housing units where COVID-19 cases have been identified, \nespecially if there is concern that incarcerated/detained individuals are not notifying staff of \nsymptoms.See Screening section for a procedure to safely perform a temperature check. \n• Consider additional options to intensify social distancing within the facility. \nManagement Strategies for Staff \n• Provide clear information to staff about the presence of COVID-19 cases within the facility, and the \nneed to enforce social distancing and encourage hygiene precautions. \no  Consider having healthcare staff perform regular rounds to answer questions about COVID-19 from staff. \n• Staff identified as close contacts of a COVID-19 case should self-quarantine at home for 14 days and \nmay return to work if symptoms do not develop. \no  See above for definition of a close contact. \no  Refer to CDC guidelines for further recommendations regarding home quarantine for staff. \nInfection Control \nInfection control guidance below is applicable to all types of correctional facilities. Individual facilities \nshould assess their unique needs based on the types of exposure staff and incarcerated/detained persons \nmay have with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases. \n•  All individuals who have the potential for direct or indirect exposure to COVID-19 cases or infectious \nmaterials (including body substances; contaminated medical supplies, devices, and equipment; \ncontaminated environmental surfaces; or contaminated air) should follow infection control practices \noutlined in the CDC Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with \nSuspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings. Monitor these \nguidelines regularly for updates. \no  Implement the above guidance as fully as possible within the correctional/detention context. Some of the \nspecific language may not apply directly to healthcare settings within correctional facilities and detention \ncenters, or to facilities without onsite healthcare capacity, and may need to be adapted to reflect facility \noperations and custody needs. \no  Note that these recommendations apply to staff as well as to incarcerated/detained individuals who may come \nin contact with contaminated materials during the course of their work placement in the facility (e.g., cleaning). \n•  Staff should exercise caution when in contact with individuals showing symptoms of a respiratory \ninfection. Contact should be minimized to the extent possible until the infected individual is wearing a face mask. If \nCOVID-19 is suspected, staff should wear recommended PPE (see PPE section). \n•  Refer to PPE section to determine recommended PPE for individuals persons in contact with confirmed \nCOVID-19 cases, contacts, and potentially contaminated items. \nClinical Care of COVID-19 Cases \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-cietention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 22 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-2   Filed 04/08/20   Page 31 of 61   Page ID\n #:5367\n•  Facilities should ensure that incarcerated/detained individuals receive medical evaluation and \ntreatment at the first signs of COVID-19 symptoms. \no  If a facility is not able to provide such evaluation and treatment, a plan should be in place to safely transfer the \nindividual to another facility or local hospital. \no  The initial medical evaluation should determine whether a symptomatic individual is at higher risk for severe \nillness from COVID-19. Persons at higher risk may include older adults and persons of any age with serious \nunderlying medical conditions such as lung disease, heart disease, and diabetes. See CDC's website for a \ncomplete list, and check regularly for updates as more data become available to inform this issue. \n• Staff evaluating and providing care for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases should follow the CDC \nInterim Clinical Guidance for Management of Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) \nand monitor the guidance website regularly for updates to these recommendations. \n•  Healthcare staff should evaluate persons with respiratory symptoms or contact with a COVID-19 case in \na separate room, with the door closed if possible, while wearing recommended PPE and ensuring that \nthe suspected case is wearing a face mask. \no  If possible, designate a room near each housing unit to evaluate individuals with COVID-19 symptoms, rather \nthan having them walk through the facility to be evaluated in the medical unit. \nClinicians are strongly encouraged to test for other causes of respiratory illness (e.g., influenza). \nG \n•  The facility should have a plan in place to safely transfer persons with severe illness from COVID-19 to \na local hospital if they require care beyond what the facility is able to provide. \n•  When evaluating and treating persons with symptoms of COVID-19 who do not speak English, using a \nlanguage line or provide a trained interpreter when possible. \nRecommended PPE and PPE Training for Staff and \nIncarcerated/Detained Persons \n•  Ensure that all staff (healthcare and non-healthcare) and incarcerated/detained persons who will have \ncontact with infectious materials in their work placements have been trained to correctly don, doff, and \ndispose of PPE relevant to the level of contact they will have with confirmed and suspected COVID-19 \ncases. \nEnsure that staff and incarcerated/detained persons who require respiratory protection (e.g., N95s) for their \no \nwork responsibilities have been medically cleared, trained, and fit-tested in the context of an employer's \nrespiratory protection program. \nFor PPE training materials and posters, please visit the CDC website on Protecting Healthcare Personnel. \no \n•  Ensure that all staff are trained to perform hand hygiene after removing PPE. \n•  If administrators anticipate that incarcerated/detained persons will request unnecessary PPE, consider \nproviding training on the different types of PPE that are needed for differing degrees of contact with \nCOVID-19 cases and contacts, and the reasons for those differences (see Table 1). Monitor linked CDC \nguidelines in Table 1 for updates to recommended PPE. \n•  Keep recommended PPE near the spaces in the facility where it could be needed, to facilitate quick \naccess in an emergency. \n•  Recommended PPE for incarcerated/detained individuals and staff in a correctional facility will vary \nbased on the type of contact they have with COVID-19 cases and their contacts (see Table 1). Each type of \nrecommended PPE is defined below. As above, note that PPE shortages are anticipated in every category \nduring the COVID-19 response. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 23 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-2   Filed 04/08/20   Page 32 of 61   Page ID\n #:5368\no  N95 respirator \nSee below for guidance on when face masks are acceptable alternatives for N95s.

Below, verbal screening questions for COVID-19 symptoms and \ncontact with known cases, and a safe temperature check procedure are detailed. \n• Verbal screening for symptoms of COVID-19 and contact with COVID-19 cases should include the \nfollowing questions: \no  Today or in the past 24 hours, have you had any of the following symptoms? \n■  Fever, felt feverish, or had chills? \n■  Cough? \n■  Difficulty breathing? \no  In the past 14 days, have you had contact with a person known to be infected with the novel coronavirus \n(COVID-19)? \n• The following is a protocol to safely check an individual's temperature: \no  Perform hand hygiene \no  Put on a face mask, eye protection (goggles or disposable face shield that fully covers the front and sides of the \nface), gown/coveralls, and a single pair of disposable gloves \no  Check individual's temperature \no  If performing a temperature check on multiple individuals, ensure that a clean pair of gloves is \nused for each individual and that the thermometer has been thoroughly cleaned in between each \ncheck. If disposable or non-contact thermometers are used and the screener did not have physical contact \nwith an individual, gloves do not need to be changed before the next check. If non-contact thermometers are \nused, they should be cleaned routinely as recommended by CDC for infection control. \no  Remove and discard PPE \no  perform hand hygiene \nPage last reviewed: March 23, 2020 \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html  3/23/20, 12:05 PM \nPage 26 of 26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-2   Filed 04/08/20   Page 35 of 61   Page ID\n #:5371\nEXHIBIT B \nto Declaration of  \nDawn Ceja \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-2   Filed 04/08/20   Page 36 of 61   Page ID\nCoronavirus Information for \n #:5372\nStaff and Detainees \nInformacion sobre el \ncoronavirus Para el personal y \nlos detenidos \nifrA'AfratthlitElta* \ng6ng zuo ren yuan he bei jO liu zhe guan zhueng bing du xin xi \n1-11 0(id \na?iLiA111-11),\" \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 256-2   Filed 04/08/20   Page 37 of 61   Page ID\n #:5373\nhands \n+hal- look. \nclean can 8.1-i11 \nJ \nhave iclai \ngerms! \ne \nr. \nGet Soap \n1„.A,ro,\n14aNdS! \n@Scrub \n• \n0 \ninse \n0 Dry \nU.S, °apartment al \nWC_ 1-tcalTh And Human 5-aryl:as \nCon Li;  r L1,5f as e \nC., wry I and Peevpnlipn \ntlynseinncid ny C.411Ci.

Procedural Background\nOn December 19, 2017, Raul Novoa (“Novoa”) filed a putative class action complaint \nagainst Defendant The GEO Group, Inc. (“GEO”).  (Dkt. No. 1.)  Novoa filed a first amended \ncomplaint on July 6, 2018,  (Dkt. No. 47), and a second amended complaint on December 24, \n2018, which added Jaime Campos Fuentes (“Fuentes”) as a Plaintiff, (“SAC,” Dkt. No. 108).  \nOn August 16, 2019, Plaintiffs sought leave to file a third amended complaint.  (Dkt. Nos. 167, \n169.)  The Court granted leave, (Dkt. No. 183), and Plaintiffs filed the third amended complaint, \nwhich is operative, (“TAC,” Dkt. No. 184).  The TAC added Abdiaziz Karim (“Karim”) and \nPage 1 of 28  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 223   Filed 11/26/19   Page 2 of 28   Page ID #:4533\nRamon Mancia (“Mancia”) as Plaintiffs, amended the class definitions, and added two causes of \naction.  (see Dkt. No. 183 at 2.) \n \nThe TAC alleges seven causes of action arising from Plaintiffs’ detention at California’s \nAdelanto Detention Center (“Adelanto”): (1) violation of California’s Minimum Wage Law, Cal. \nLabor Code §§ 1194, 1197, 1197.1; (2) unjust enrichment; (3) violation of California’s Unfair \nCompetition Law, Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 17200, et seq.; (4) violation of California’s \nTrafficking Victims Protection Act (“CTVPA”), Cal. Civ. Code § 52.5; (5) forced labor under \nthe Federal Trafficking Victims Protection Act (“TVPA”), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1589(a), 1594(a); (6) \nforced and attempted forced labor under the TVPA; and (7) retaliation.1  The TAC defines three \nputative classes (four, including sub-classes), which are discussed in greater detail below.   \n \nPlaintiffs filed the Motion on September 27, 2019.  (Mot.)  In support of the Motion, they \nincluded the following declarations and related exhibits: the Declaration of Lydia Wright, \n(“Wright Declaration,” Dkt. No. 193 (attaching Exhibits 1 to 34)); the Declaration of Raul \nNovoa, (“Novoa Declaration,” Dkt.

No. 210 (attaching Exhibits 1 to 5)).  \nOn November 12, 2019, Defendant filed a notice of supplemental authority. (“Defendant’s \nNotice,” Dkt. No. 215 (attaching Ex. A).)   \n                                                 \n1 Plaintiffs do not define the proposed classes to cover the retaliation claim, and the \nparties generally ignore this claim in their briefing on the Motion.  The retaliation claim involves \nGEO’s counterclaim to the original complaint for unjust enrichment and declaratory relief.  (Dkt. \nNos. 45, 58.)  GEO filed an Answer to the TAC, which includes only a conditional counterclaim \nfor declaratory relief, on October 15, 2019.  (Dkt. No. 200).  Plaintiffs filed an answer to the \ncounterclaim on October 28, 2019.  (Dkt. No. 204.) \n2 GEO resubmitted Exhibit D with a notice of Errata.  (Dkt. Nos. 212, 212-1)  \nPage 2 of 28  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 223   Filed 11/26/19   Page 3 of 28   Page ID #:4534\n \nOn the same day as Plaintiffs’ Reply, Defendant filed a motion to exclude the declarations \nof non-Plaintiff declarants Aguilera and Marwaha.  (“MTE,” Dkt. No 211.)  Plaintiffs opposed \nthe Motion to Exclude, (“Opposition to MTE,” Dkt. No. 213), and attached the Declaration of \nLydia Wright in support of the Opposition to the Motion to Exclude, (“Wright Declaration III,” \nDkt. No. 213-1).  Defendant filed a response. (“MTE Response,” Dkt. No. 216.)  \n \nB.  Factual Background \n \nThis putative class action is brought by current and former immigration detainees against \nthe operator of an immigration detention facility located in the City of Adelanto, California \n(“Adelanto”).  Plaintiffs were held at Adelanto while their immigration cases were pending.  \nGEO is a business that operates more than a dozen immigration detention centers around the \ncountry.  Since May 2011, GEO has operated the Adelanto facility as a subcontractor for the City \nof Adelanto, which entered into an Intergovernmental Service Agreement (“IGSA”) with \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) to hold immigration detainees at the facility.  \n(Wright Decl. at Exs. 2, 3.)   \n \nUnder the IGSA, GEO is required to comply with ICE’s Performance Based National \nDetention Standards, (“PBNDS,” Wright Decl. at Ex. 14; Opp’n at 4), which set out “expected \noutcomes” and “minimum requirements” for the management of contract facilities like \nAdelanto.  These outcomes and requirements touch on nearly all aspects of operating an \nimmigration detention facility, including emergency planning, environmental health and safety, \nuse of force and, as relevant to this action, arrangements for detainee labor within the facility.  \n(Id. at Ex. 2, p. 8.)  GEO has either companywide or facility-specific policies that must meet or \nexceed the minimum standards in the PBNDS, and which apply across the company or facility.  \n(Id. at Ex. 4, pp. 28-29 (referencing both company-wide and facility-specific policies).)  Under \nthe IGSA and the PBNDS, GEO is required to provide immigrants with basic necessities such as \nfood, shelter, utilities, clothing, bedding, and health services.  The PBNDS also require \nrecreation, religious practice opportunities, and visitation, among other activities.  Under the \nPBNDS § 5.8, GEO must create a detainee “voluntary work program” that complies with the \nPBNDS requirements.  (Id. at Ex. 5, pp. 60, 62.) \n \n1.  PBNDS “Voluntary Work Program” Requirements \n \nThe expected outcomes and minimum requirements of the “Voluntary Work Program” \nare located in Section 5 of the PBNDS, which deals with multiple detainee activities, such as \nreligion and correspondence.  PBNDS § 5.8.  Under § 5.8, detainees “shall be provided the \nopportunity to participate in a voluntary work program.”  Id.  They “shall not be required to \nwork, except to do personal housekeeping.”  Id.  Required personal housekeeping is defined in § \n5.8: \n \n// \n// \nPage 3 of 28  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 223   Filed 11/26/19   Page 4 of 28   Page ID #:4535\nDetainees are required to maintain their immediate living areas in a neat and \norderly manner by:  \n1.  making their bunk beds daily; \n2.  stacking loose papers; \n3.  keeping the floor free of debris and dividers free of clutter; and \n4.  refraining from hanging/draping clothing, pictures, keepsakes, or other \nobjects from beds, overhead lighting fixtures or other furniture. \n \nId.  More labor-intensive tasks beyond such “required personal housekeeping” or outside \nthe “immediate living area” of each detainee must follow the PBNDS requirements for \nvoluntary work.  The PBNDS direct the facility administrator to develop written rules for \nselecting “work detail volunteers,” including a work program agreement.  Id.  The \nvolunteers must receive “at least” $1.00 per day.  Id.    \n \nPlaintiffs claim GEO takes advantage of the voluntary work program to benefit from free \nor nearly-free detainee labor, which is not truly voluntary and which GEO exploits on a daily \nbasis as a “round-the-clock cleaning, sanitation, and maintenance staff.”  (Mot. at 16.)  Plaintiffs \ndescribe four problematic policies or practices, under which they claim detainees are effectively \ncompelled to work beyond required housekeeping or compelled to “volunteer” for work details: \n(1) Work Program Policy; (2) Uncompensated Work Program Policy; (3) Housing Unit \nSanitation Policy, and (4) Deprivation Policy.  (Mot. at 5.)  GEO responds that Plaintiffs \nmischaracterize the nature of detainee labor at Adelanto.  The company states that it complies \nwith the PBNDS and that its work policies are approved by ICE.  (Opp’n at  8; Ragsdale Decl. at \n¶ 4.)   \n \n2.  Work Program Policy \n \nFirst, Plaintiffs state GEO operates a detainee Work Program Policy (“Work Program”), \n(Mot. at 6-9), at Adelanto, which is recorded in § 8.1.8 of GEO’s Adelanto Policy and Procedure \nManual.  (Adelanto Work Program, Wright Decl. at Ex. 15.)  GEO also issues an Adelanto \nSupplemental Detainee Handbook with more specific rules, regulations, policies, and procedures \nconcerning the Work Program.  (Adelanto Supp. Detainee Handbook, Wright Decl. Ex. 16.)  \nAvailable work assignments include food service, laundry, dorm cleaning, cores/hallway, \ncourt/visit, recreation, floor crew, barbershop, intake, medical detail, paint detail, and \nwarehouse.  (Work Detail Application, Wright Decl. at Ex. 17; Opp’n at 9 (citing Wright Decl. at \nEx. 2, p. 63 (“the detainee work plan must be voluntary, and may include work or program \nassignments for industrial, maintenance, custodial, service, or other jobs.”).)  \n \nGEO sets work schedules, assigns detainee workers to shifts and workdays of no more \nthan 8 hours, and provides needed equipment and instructions.  (Mot at 7-8.)  GEO maintains \nrecords of detainee work hours, and pays detainees by depositing money into their commissary \naccounts.  (Id. at 10; Wright Decl. at Ex. 22.)  At Adelanto, detainee workers earn $1.00 per day \nfor participating in the program.  (Mot. at 9.) \n \nPage 4 of 28  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 223   Filed 11/26/19   Page 5 of 28   Page ID #:4536\n3.  Uncompensated Work Program Policy \n \nSecond, Plaintiffs state that an unwritten Uncompensated Work Program Policy exists, \n(Mot. at 9-10), under which applicants for the Work Program must work for an arbitrary period \nof time for no compensation whatsoever, in the hopes that they will eventually be hired into the \nWork Program.  GEO failed to respond to a request for admission, and so admitted pursuant to \nFed. R. Civ. P. 36(a)(3) that it “permits detainees at the Adelanto Facility to work for no \ncompensation at all if all paid Work Program positions are filled.”  (Mot. at 9 (Wright Decl. at \nEx. 34, p. 7).)  The work detail application states there are only 40 paid positions available at a \ntime.  (Wright Decl. at Ex. 17.)  In its Answer to the TAC, GEO denies that an Uncompensated \nWork Program exists as such, but admits Work Program participants may “choose to perform \nself-care tasks” including meal preparation and basic housekeeping chores.  (Dkt. No. 200 ¶¶ 57-\n58.) \n \nIn addition to the GEO work detail application, Plaintiffs attach detainee declarations \nregarding such unpaid “volunteer” work.3  (Fuentes Decl. ¶ 9; Karim Decl. ¶¶ 7, 10;  Mancia \nDecl. at ¶ 8 (“I have never been compensated for my labor as a porter.  Instead GEO officials \noccasionally give me extra food or milk.”); Aguilera Decl. at ¶ 9 (“I worked as a porter from \napproximately January 2019 until June 2019. . . . During this period, the GEO employees \ndemanded that I worked for free.”).)  Plaintiffs also attach several emails from GEO employees \nshowing that detainees worked throughout the facility, (Wright Decl. at Ex. 6 (“We need all \nshifts to start putting detainees to work in the hallways, medical, intake, the ‘D-Spaces,’ and the \nhallways leading to the housing units, etc. . . . I don’t want excuses, just action.”), Ex. 8 (listing \nareas outside of detainee bunks “that can use improvement with attention and detainee labor” \nand noting “no detainee workers were present working (I know shifts are short staffed today)”), \nEx. 9 (stating ahead of inspection that facilities “need to be sparkling” and to “use as many \ndetainee crews as necessary”),  Exs. 10-11, 21 (noting the receipt of detainee complaints about \nnot being paid).).  Plaintiffs also demonstrate that unpaid workers were tracked in the same \nsystem used for paid workers.  (Wright Decl. at Ex. 22, p. 2 (tracking duty assignments for a \nsingle day far in excess of the 40 paid positions, and including handwritten notes such \n“volunteer” and “[redacted name] was a worker for seg; wants to know why she was not on \npayroll.  She works every day.”).)   \n \n4.  Housing Unit Sanitation Policies (“HUSPs”) \n \nPlaintiffs also describe a GEO company-wide practice of Housing Unit Sanitation Policies \n(“HUSPs”) that apply at GEO immigration detention centers nationwide.  (Mot. at 10 (citing \n                                                 \n3 Novoa’s Declaration does not state he worked without receiving $1.00 per day. The \nother named Plaintiffs do state they worked without pay at jobs clearly outside of the required \npersonal housekeeping tasks. \n \nPage 5 of 28  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 223   Filed 11/26/19   Page 6 of 28   Page ID #:4537\nPlaintiffs’ requests for admission as to each facility, which GEO failed to answer).)4  Plaintiffs \ncontend these HUSPs impermissibly expand the scope of “required personal housekeeping” \notherwise permissible under the PBNDS.   \n \nPlaintiffs emphasize facts tending to show that the scope of GEO’s HUSPs is far beyond \nthe four “required personal housekeeping” tasks in the PBNDS.  Whereas the PBNDS limit \nrequired tasks to a detainee’s “immediate living area” and define minimal practices of tidiness \nsuch as stacking papers, making the bed, and clearing clutter from the floor, the Adelanto policy \nmakes detainees responsible for the cleanliness of walls, floors, sinks, toilets, windows within the \n“cell, room, or living area.”  (Wright Decl. at Ex. 3.)  At 6 a.m. each Detainee is issued mops, \nbuckets, brooms, scrub brushes, cleaning rags, and chemicals, and officers supervise the \nmandatory cleaning.  (Id.)  Another section of the GEO policy expands the area of responsibility \nto “all commonly accessible areas of the unit” including “microwaves, tables, and chairs,” and \nnotes “each and every detainee must participate.”  (Id. at Ex. 24.)  A third plan provides that on \na weekly basis or as needed each unit as a whole is subject to a “total sanitation mission.”  (Id. at \nEx. 18.)   \n \nUnder GEO’s written policy, detainee compliance may be obtained by the imposition of \nsanctions, because refusal to clean one’s living area is classified in the Supplemental Detainee \nHandbook as a “High Moderate” offense.  (Id. at Ex. 16, p. 29.)  Punishments can vary from a \nwarning or reprimand to 72 hours in disciplinary restriction, the initiation of criminal \nproceedings, disciplinary transfer (which is “recommended”), monetary restitution (“if funds \nare available”), loss of privileges, change of housing, restriction of the detainee to the living unit, \nor other sanctions.  (Id.)  \n \nGEO does not dispute the existence of these policies, but argues they are within the scope \nof what the PBNDS allow, and also note Plaintiffs were never placed in “solitary confinement”5  \n                                                 \n4 GEO argues Plaintiffs attach no evidence that the HUSPs exist at other GEO facilities \nother than the Adelanto facility, but does not respond to Plaintiffs’ argument that GEO \neffectively admitted the HUSPs existence by failing to respond to Plaintiffs RFAs on this subject.  \n(Opp’n at 3 n.4 (arguing narrowly that GEO did not admit in its previous briefing the application \nof an Adelanto-specific “Housekeeping Plan” at other facilities, and failing to address the \nRFAs).)  GEO also does not adequately address Plaintiffs’ argument that, at minimum, the \nMenocal litigation shows the existence of a HUSP at the Aurora, Colorado facility.  Menocal v. \nGEO Grp., Inc., 320 F.R.D. 258 (D. Colo. 2017), aff’d, 882 F.3d 905 (10th Cir. 2018), cert. \ndenied, 139 S. Ct. 143 (2018). \n5 GEO also attaches excerpts from the deposition of Amber Martin to refute Plaintiffs’ \nclaims that detainees may be subjected to disciplinary segregation for failure to perform cleaning \ntasks.  (DeLaney Decl. at Ex. G.)  GEO does not define Martin’s role, but notes her deposition \nwas taken as part of the Menocal case.  (Opp’n at 7.)  Martin stated, “We’ve never given a \ndetainee solitary confinement for refusing to clean their areas.” (DeLaney Decl. at Ex. G, p. 134.)  \nIt does not seem the statement covers Adelanto, because the deposition was on the subject of the \n \nPage 6 of 28  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 223   Filed 11/26/19   Page 7 of 28   Page ID #:4538\nand did not personally suffer “abuse of legal process.”  (Opp’n at 3.)  GEO highlights portions of \nan ICE Detainee Handbook that uses more expansive language than the PBNDS, which instructs: \n“you must keep areas that you use clean, including your living area and any general use areas that \nyou use.”  (DeLaney Decl. at Ex. F, p. 12.)  The ICE Detainee Handbook also warns “you may \nbe disciplined” if you do not keep your areas clean.  (Id.)  GEO also notes that the PBNDS \ncontemplate discipline for a detainee’s “refusal to clean assigned living area,” and includes many \nof the same sanctions as GEO, including criminal proceedings, transfer, or segregation for 72 \nhours, and lesser punishments.  PBNDS § 3.1. \n \nAlthough Plaintiffs rely principally upon Adelanto-specific policies in their description of \nthe HUSP, they note GEO’s default admission that HUSPs exist at twelve other facilities.  (Id. at \nEx. 34).  They also cite Menocal v. GEO Grp., Inc., in which the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of Colorado certified a class challenging a similar HUSP at a GEO facility in Aurora \nColorado.  320 F.R.D. 258 (D. Col. 2017) (certifying a Work Program class and HUSP class on \nsimilar evidence); aff’d, 882 F.3d 905 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 139 S. Ct. 143 (2018). \n \n5.  Deprivation Policy \n \nPlaintiffs and GEO largely agree on the existence of the Work Program, and Defendant \ndoes not seriously dispute that detainees often work without pay under the Uncompensated \nWork Program as Plaintiffs describe it.  Rather, the parties’ factual disputes center on whether \nparticipants join or participate voluntarily, or are coerced to join by an alleged “Deprivation \nPolicy.”  (Mot. at 15.)  Under this policy, Plaintiffs claim6 GEO deprives Adelanto detainees of \n“basic living necessities, including sufficient food.” (Mot. at 15.) \n \nDefendant denies that detainees are deprived of necessities such as food, water, and \nhygiene products, and draws attention to apparent inconsistencies in Plaintiffs’ individual \naccounts of “deprivation.”  (Opp’n at 10 (noting some Plaintiffs had sources of outside funding, \nor received certain basic necessities, and pointing to disparities between detainee deposition \ntestimony and their declarations).)  To demonstrate the existence of such a policy, Plaintiffs cite \nnot only their individual experiences, (Mot. at 16 (citing detainee declarations)), but also OIG \nreports finding PBNDS violations at Adelanto.  (Id.; Wright Decl. at Exs. 28-30.)  Plaintiffs argue \nthe reports and their experience establish Adelanto detainees often lack sufficient food, clothing, \n                                                 \nAurora Colorado facility.  Similarly, a GEO official distinguished between solitary confinement \ncells and GEO’s “disciplinary rooms,” which he stated are double bunked.  (Opp’n at 7.)  Thus, \nGEO’s denial that it punishes detainees with solitary confinement does not rule out that it \npunishes detainees with disciplinary segregation or with the other sanctions outlined in its policy. \n6 Plaintiffs first introduce the phrase “Deprivation Policy” in the Motion, not the TAC.  \nHowever, the TAC alleges GEO maintains a “corporate policy and uniform practice of \nwithholding sufficient food, water, and hygiene products from the immigrants detained at \nAdelanto,” (TAC ¶ 43),  and asserts facts which, if true, would support the existence of such a \npolicy.  (TAC ¶¶ 6, 43 100-107, 122, 126-30, 150, 152, 167.) \nPage 7 of 28  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 223   Filed 11/26/19   Page 8 of 28   Page ID #:4539\nor personal hygiene items, and work without pay only to receive such necessities as gifts from \nofficers, or to increase their commissary balance and purchase those necessities.  (Mot. at 15.-16.)   \n \nPlaintiffs also attach evidence of the economic incentives for GEO to compel detainees to \nwork.  If detainees are not available to staff a job, GEO must pay its own staff to complete the \nwork, which may include overtime if the task cannot be completed within normal business hours.  \n(Mot. at 8, 17-18 (citing Janeka Deposition, Wright Decl. at Ex. 4, pp. 221-222) (explaining that \nICE pays GEO the same bed-day rate regardless of GEO’s actual operating costs).) According to \nthe Statement of Work attached to the IGSA, “[d]etainees shall not be used to perform the \nresponsibilities or duties of an employee of [GEO].”  (Wright Decl. at Ex. 2, pp. 63.)  Plaintiffs \nnote deposition testimony that, for the nearly 2,000-bed facility, GEO employs six non-detainee \njanitors, and previously employed only three.  (Opp’n at 13 (citing Wright Decl. at Ex. 4, pp. 52-\n53).)  The janitors clean ICE and GEO offices outside the secured perimeter of the facility, where \ndetainees are not allowed.  (Opp’n at 13.)7   \n \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \n \nA. Rule 23 \n \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 (“Rule 23”) governs the litigation of class actions.  A \nparty seeking class certification must establish the following prerequisites:  \n \n(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there \nare questions of law or fact common to the class; (3) the claims or defenses of the \nrepresentative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and (4) the \nrepresentative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.  \n \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  After satisfying the four prerequisites of numerosity, commonality, \ntypicality, and adequacy, a party must also demonstrate one of the following: (1) a risk that \nseparate actions would create incompatible standards of conduct for the defendant or prejudice \nindividual class members not parties to the action; (2) the defendant has treated the members of \nthe class as a class, making appropriate injunctive or declaratory relief with respect to the class as \na whole; or (3) common questions of law or fact predominate over questions affecting individual \n                                                 \n7 GEO counters that it does not determine its staffing needs by taking into account the \nnumber of detainee workers, (Opp’n at 14), but the deposition excerpts to which GEO cites do \nnot support the proposition.  The factual assertion is also contradicted by the PBNDS \nrequirement that any voluntary workers receive instruction and oversight from a work supervisor.  \nPBNDS § 5.8.  Finally, GEO argues that ICE reimburses it for the $1.00 per day detainee labor \nexpense.  This fact shows only that GEO does not ultimately pay at all for detainee work that \nmust otherwise be completed by GEO staff. \n \nPage 8 of 28  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 223   Filed 11/26/19   Page 9 of 28   Page ID #:4540\nmembers and that a class action is a superior method for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the \naction.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1)-(3).8 \n   \nA trial court has broad discretion regarding whether to grant a motion for class \ncertification.  See Bateman v. Am. Multi-Cinema, Inc., 623 F.3d 708, 712 (9th Cir. 2010).  \nHowever, “[a] party seeking class certification must affirmatively demonstrate compliance with \n[Rule 23]—that is, the party must be prepared to prove that there are in fact sufficiently \nnumerous parties, common questions of law or fact, etc.”  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 \nU.S. 338, 350 (2011).  A district court must conduct a “rigorous analysis” that frequently “will \nentail some overlap with the merits of the plaintiff’s underlying claim.”  Id. at 351.  “Courts \ntypically proceed claim-by-claim in determining whether the Rule 23 requirements have been \nmet, particularly as to the Rule 23(a)(2) and (b)(3) requirements of common questions and \npredominance.”  Allen v. Verizon California, Inc., 2010 WL 11583099, at *2 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 12, \n2010).  The Court sets out the legal standards for each of Plaintiffs’ claims in this section, \nbecause the commonality and predominance inquiries require an understanding of the claims. \n \nRule 23 further provides that “[w]hen appropriate, an action may be brought or \nmaintained as a class action with respect to particular issues,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4), or the \n“class may be divided into subclasses that are each treated as a class under this rule,” Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 23(c)(5).  “This means that each subclass must independently meet the requirements of \nRule 23 for the maintenance of a class action.”  Betts v. Reliable Collection Agency, Ltd., 659 \nF.2d 1000, 1005 (9th Cir. 1981). \n \nB.  California Employment Tests \n \nThe California Supreme Court articulated the general common law test for determining \nwhether an employment relationship exists for the purposes of California labor law in S. G. \nBorello & Sons, Inc. v. Dep’t of Indus. Relations, 48 Cal. 3d 341 (1989).  Under Borello, “[t]he \nprincipal test of an employment relationship is whether the person to whom service is rendered \nhas the right to control the manner and means of accomplishing the result desired[.]”  Id. at 350 \n(internal quotation marks omitted).  In applying the Borello test, courts also consider the \nfollowing secondary factors: \n \n(a) whether the one performing services is engaged in a distinct occupation or \nbusiness; (b) the kind of occupation, with reference to whether, in the locality, the \nwork is usually done under the direction of the principal or by a specialist without \nsupervision; (c) the skill required in the particular occupation; (d) whether the \n                                                 \n8 While some circuits have adopted an “ascertainability” prerequisite to certification, the \nNinth Circuit has not.  Briseno v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., 844 F.3d 1121, 1124 n.4 (9th Cir. 2017) \n(“ConAgra cites no other precedent to support the notion that our court has adopted an \n‘ascertainability’ requirement.  This is not surprising because we have not.  Instead, we have \naddressed the types of alleged definitional deficiencies other courts have referred to as \n‘ascertainability’ issues . . . through analysis of Rule 23’s enumerated requirements.”). \nPage 9 of 28  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 223   Filed 11/26/19   Page 10 of 28   Page ID\n #:4541\nprincipal or the worker supplies the instrumentalities, tools, and the place of work \nfor the person doing the work; (e) the length of time for which the services are to be \nperformed; (f) the method of payment, whether by the time or by the job; (g) \nwhether or not the work is a part of the regular business of the principal; and (h) \nwhether or not the parties believe they are creating the relationship of employer-\nemployee. \n \nId. at 351. \n \n  Claims governed by California’s Industrial Welfare Commission’s (IWC) definition of \nemployment, however, are subject to a broader standard, which “incorporates the common law \ndefinition as one alternative.”  Martinez v. Combs, 49 Cal. 4th 35, 64 (2010), as modified (June 9, \n2010).  In Martinez, the California Supreme Court held that the IWC’s definition of “to \nemploy” included three alternative definitions: “(a) to exercise control over the wages, hours or \nworking conditions, or (b) to suffer or permit to work, or (c) to engage, thereby creating a \ncommon law employment relationship.”  Id.  As to the first definition, the court noted that it \n“encompasses ‘any person . . . who directly or indirectly, or through an agent or any other \nperson, employs or exercises control over the wages, hours, or working conditions of any \nperson[.]’”  Id. at 71 (quoting Wage Order No. 14 (Cal. Code Regs., Tit. 8, § 11140, subd. 2(F)). \n \nWith regard to the “suffer or permit to work” prong, the court elaborated that “the basis \nof liability is the defendant’s knowledge of and failure to prevent the work from occurring.”  Id. \nat 70.  It concluded that the defendants had not “suffered or permitted plaintiffs to work because \nneither had the power to prevent plaintiffs from working.”  Id.  Specifically, it considered the \ndefendants’ lack of control over hiring and firing decisions, setting wages and hours, and \ndetermining when and where workers would report to work.  Id.  The court did not elaborate on \nthe third definition, as the plaintiffs advanced arguments under only the first two definitions.  See \nid. at 68.  The court declined to decide whether the Borello test had any relevance to wage claims.  \nId. at 73.   \n \nIn Dynamex Operations W. v. Superior Court, the California Supreme Court adopted a \ntest known as the “ABC test” for interpreting the “suffer or permit to work” prong of the \nIWC’s definition of employ.  4 Cal. 5th 903, 956–57 (2018), reh’g denied (June 20, 2018).  Under \nthat test, the hiring entity bears the burden of establishing that a worker is an independent \ncontractor rather than an employee.  Id. at 957.  In order to meet that burden, it must establish \neach of the test’s three factors:  \n(A) that the worker is free from the control and direction of the hiring entity in \nconnection with the performance of the work, both under the contract for the \nperformance of the work and in fact; and (B) that the worker performs work that is \noutside the usual course of the hiring entity’s business; and (C) that the worker is \ncustomarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business \nof the same nature as the work performed. \n \nPage 10 of 28  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 223   Filed 11/26/19   Page 11 of 28   Page ID\n #:4542\nId.  Thus, if the putative employer fails to establish any one of the three prongs with regard to a \nworker, the worker is properly classified as an employee for the purposes of IWC wage orders.  \n \nC. TVPA and CTVPA \n \nEnacted as part of the Trafficking and Victims Protection Act of 2000 (“TVPA”), 18 \nU.S.C. § 1589 proscribes a party from “knowingly provid[ing] or obtain[ing] the labor or services \nof a person” through force, physical restraint, serious harm, abuse of law or legal process, threats \nof any of those means, or any combination of those methods.  18 U.S.C. § 1589(a).  Also liable is a \nparty who “knowingly benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value, from participation in \na venture” involving forced labor.  18 U.S.C. § 1589(b).  Title 18 U.S.C. § 1595 provides the civil \nremedy to a victim of forced labor.  18 U.S.C. § 1595.  A ten-year statute of limitations applies to \nclaims under the TVPA.   Deutsch v. Turner Corp., 324 F.3d 692, 717 & n.18 (9th Cir. 2003), \ncert. denied, 540 U.S. 820 (2003). \n \nA victim of human trafficking may bring a civil action for damages or injunctive relief \nunder California Civil Code § 52.5 (“CTVPA”).  Cal. Civ. Code § 52.5(a).  California’s human \ntrafficking statute provides in pertinent part that “[a] person who deprives or violates the \npersonal liberty of another with the intent to obtain forced labor or services, is guilty of human \ntrafficking.”  Cal. Penal Code § 236.1.  The elements of the criminal offense are (1) the defendant \neither deprived another person of personal liberty or violated that other person’s personal liberty; \nand (2) when the defendant did so, he or she intended to obtain forced labor or services from that \nperson.  People v. Halim, 14 Cal. App. 5th 632, 643 (2017),  reh’g denied (Sept. 12, 2017), review \ndenied (Nov. 29, 2017), cert. denied sub nom. Halim v. California, 138 S. Ct. 1564 (2018).  \nForced labor services are defined as “labor or services that are performed or provided by a person \nand are obtained or maintained through force, fraud, duress, or coercion, or equivalent conduct \nthat would reasonably overbear the will of the person.”  Cal. Penal Code § 236.1(h)(5).   \n \nIII.   DISCUSSION \n \nA. Preliminary Matters: Motion to Exclude and Standing \n \n1.  Motion to Exclude \n \nGEO moves to exclude the declarations of non-plaintiff detainees Aguilera and Marwaha \non the grounds that it learned of their identity for the first time on September 27, 2019, when \nPlaintiffs filed their Motion, which included Aguilera and Marwaha’s declarations.  (MTE at 3.)  \nDefendant argues the non-disclosure of Aguilera and Marwaha until the filing of the Motion is a \nviolation of Rule 26’s requirement that initial disclosures be supplemented in a timely manner.  \n(Id. at 5 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e), and 37(c)(1)).) \n \nAccording to the MTE and MTE Opposition, the chronology is as follows.  Plaintiffs’ \nfirst initial disclosure was made on July 27, 2018.  On June 17, 2019, Plaintiffs made their first \nsupplemental disclosure.  The declarations in question were signed the next month, on July 26, \nPage 11 of 28  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 223   Filed 11/26/19   Page 12 of 28   Page ID\n #:4543\n2019.  About two months later, on September 27, 2019, Defendant learned about Aguilera and \nMarwaha’s declarations when Plaintiffs served the Motion and declarations supporting class \ncertification.  At that point, GEO had 30 days to oppose the Motion.  However,  GEO did not \nserve a deposition notice for Aguilera and Marwaha until October 7, 2019, ten days after Plaintiffs \nfiled the Motion.  The next day, Plaintiffs filed their third Rule 26 supplement, which listed \nMarwaha and Aguilera.  \n \nThe Court DENIES the MTE for five reasons.  As an initial matter, it is not clear to the \nCourt why GEO would not already be aware of the identity and contact information of every \ndetainee likely to possess knowledge of the Work Program, which is evidenced by GEO’s own \nrosters of detainee names and work details.  Second, the MTE is procedurally improper.  GEO \nshould have simply objected to the declarations in its Opposition, or filed the request to exclude \nas an ex parte application.  Instead it filed a motion which must be filed not later than 28 days \nbefore the date set for hearing.  L.R. 6-1.  GEO noticed the MTE hearing for December 2, 2019, \nwhile the hearing for the Motion was set for November 18, 2019.  Third, the MTE effectively \ndemands reconsideration of the Court’s prior decision denying GEO’s ex parte request for \nenlargement of time to respond to the Motion, in which GEO first raised the issue, four days \nbefore its Opposition was due.  (Dkt. Nos. 201, 208.)  Fourth, the record shows that GEO in fact \nhad sufficient time and notice to depose Aguilera.  GEO failed to do so because it attempted to \nnotice six depositions on a week’s notice, delayed filing proper deposition notices, and/or failed \nto depose Aguilera when given an opportunity to do so before its Opposition was due.  (Dkt. No. \n202-1 -Exs. C.)  Fifth, the Court notes that neither Marwaha nor Aguilera are named Plaintiffs.  \nNeither declaration is of such importance or centrality to class certification that it merits the \ntime-consuming back-and-forth between the parties on this issue. \n \n2.  Standing \n \nGEO’s Notice of Supplemental Authority attaches a recent order in Owino v. CoreCivic, \nInc., No. 17-cv-1112 (S.D. Cal. Nov. 7, 2019), in which Judge Sammartino sua sponte ordered the \nparties to submit additional briefing on standing, with class certification pending.  (Def.’s Notice \nat Ex. A.)  In that case, the plaintiffs seek declaratory relief against CoreCivic as to their claims \nunder the TVPA and CTVPA.  (Id.)  In the order, Judge Sammartino observes that neither of the \nnamed plaintiffs were detained at the time of the commencement of the action in May 2017. \n \nGEO does not explain how the order is relevant to this case.  Novoa commenced this \naction in December 2017.  (Dkt. No. 1).  He then filed the SAC, which added Fuentes as a \nPlaintiff and alleged Fuentes was detained at Adelanto at the time of the commencement of the \naction, from December 2016 through January 2018.  (SAC ¶ 16.)  The TAC adds Karim, who \nalleges he was detained from August 2017 until August 2019, (TAC ¶ 19), and Mancia, who \nalleges he is currently detained at Adelanto.  (Id. ¶ 20.).  Mancia has standing to bring declaratory \nand injunctive relief, as do Fuentes and Karim.  Either they were detained at the time of the filing \nof one of the complaints, or the amendments adding them as Plaintiffs relate back to the time of \nfiling of the original complaint under Rule 15.  Under Rule 15(c)(1)(B) an amendment relates back \nPage 12 of 28  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 223   Filed 11/26/19   Page 13 of 28   Page ID\n #:4544\nwhere it asserts “a claim or defense that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set \nout—or attempted to be set out—in the original pleading.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(B). \n \nB.  Proposed Classes \n \nThe Court turns now to the question of class certification.  Plaintiffs seek to certify four \nclasses, including subclasses. First, they seek to certify an “Adelanto Wage Class,” (Mot. at 18), \nfor the first three causes of action: (1) violation of California’s Minimum Wage Law, Cal. Labor \nCode §§ 1194, 1197, 1197.1; (2) unjust enrichment; and (3) violation of California’s Unfair \nCompetition Law, Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 17200, et seq.  They define the class as: \n \nAll civilly detained immigrants who (i) were detained at the Adelanto ICE \nProcessing Center any time between December 19, 2014 and the date of final \njudgment in this matter, and either (ii) participated in the Voluntary Work \nProgram at any point during their detention, or (iii) performed work for no \ncompensation in the Uncompensated Work Program pending their participation \nin the Voluntary Work Program, or (iv) performed work for no compensation \npursuant to the Adelanto Housing Unit Sanitation Policy. \n \n(Id. at 19.) \n \n  Second, Plaintiffs propose an “Adelanto Forced Labor Class” for the fourth through \nsixth causes of action: (4) forced labor under CTVPA, Cal. Civ. Code § 52.5; (5) forced labor \nunder the TVPA, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1589(a), 1594(a); and (6) forced and attempted forced labor under \nthe TVPA.  The class is defined as follows: \n \nAll civil immigration detainees who were detained at the Adelanto ICE Processing \nCenter any time between May 1, 2011 and the date of final judgment in this \nmatter. \n \n(Id.)  Plaintiffs urge that the Adelanto Forced Labor Class be divided into two subclasses: \n \n(1) The Work Program Subclass: All individuals who participated in the \nVoluntary Work Program at any point during their detention. \n(2) The Uncompensated Work Program Subclass: All individuals who \nparticipated in the Uncompensated Work Program at any point during their \ndetention. \n \n(Id.) \n \nFinally, Plaintiffs propose a “Nationwide HUSP Class,” for the fifth and sixth causes of \naction: (5) forced labor under the TVPA; and (6) forced and attempted forced labor under the \nTVPA.  The HUSP class is defined as: \n \nPage 13 of 28  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 223   Filed 11/26/19   Page 14 of 28   Page ID\n #:4545\nAll civilly detained immigrants who (i) were detained at any civil immigration \ndetention center owned or operated by GEO in the United States between \nDecember 19, 2007 and the date of final judgment in this matter, and (ii) were \nsubject to a GEO Housing Unit Sanitation Policy (HUSP) at any point during \ntheir detention. \n \n(Id.)  Plaintiffs propose to exclude four categories of detainee from the nationwide class: \n \n(1) individuals detained in GEO’s family residential detention facility in Karnes \nCity, Texas; (2) individuals detained in the Alexandria Staging Facility in \nAlexandria, Louisiana; (3) any individual detained in the custody of the U.S. \nMarshalls [sic] or any other law enforcement agency at a GEO facility where the \ncompany also detains civil immigration detainees pursuant to contracts with ICE; \nand (4) civilly detained immigrants held at the Aurora ICE Processing Center in \nAurora, Colorado at any time before October 22, 2014. \n \n(Id. at 19-20.)

Rule 23(a) Requirements \n \n1.  Numerosity \n \nRule 23(a)(1) requires the class to be so numerous that joinder of individual class \nmembers is impracticable.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1).  There is no particular number cut-off, as \nthe specific facts of each case may be examined.  Ballard v. Equifax Check Servs., Inc., 186 F.R.D. \n589, 594 (E.D. Cal. 1999).  Courts have not required evidence of exact class size or the identities \nof class members to satisfy the requirements of Rule 23(a)(1).  See Robidoux v. Celani, 987 F.2d \n931, 935 (2d Cir. 1993). \n \na.  Contentions of the Parties \n \nPlaintiffs  argue numerosity is satisfied with regard to the Adelanto Wage and Adelanto \nForced Labor classes because Adelanto houses up to 1,940 individuals each day, with a \n“guaranteed minimum” of 1,455 beds  (Mot. at 20.)  Likewise, the Adelanto “Facility \nAdministrator/Warden” estimated at his deposition that 200 to 300 detainees were eligible to \nreport for a Work Program shift in the kitchen alone.  (Id. (citing Wright Decl. at Ex. 4, pp. 190:5-\n191:6 (attaching the Deposition of James Janeka)).)  Furthermore, Plaintiffs argue, GEO sought \nreimbursement from ICE for more than 30 thousand Work Program Shifts from September 2014 \nto August 2015.  (Id. at 21 (citing Wright Decl. at Ex. 33).)  Plaintiffs argue this evidence is \nsufficient to establish numerosity for the Adelanto Wage and Adelanto Forced Labor Classes.  \nThe Nationwide HUSP Class is even more numerous, Plaintiffs contend, because GEO facilities \nhouse thousands of immigration detainees each day, and the same HUSP and discipline policy \napplies to each.  (Id.; see also Wright Decl. at Ex. 34.) \n \nDefendant argues that assertions of numerosity must be accompanied by evidence.  \n(Opp’n at 31 (citing Newberry v. Cty. of San Bernardino, 2015 WL 9701153, at *4 (C.D. Cal. July \n23, 2015), aff d, 750 F. App’x 534 (9th Cir. 2018)).  GEO claims that although Adelanto may have \na capacity for 1,950 detainees, the maximum capacity does not bear on the number of individuals \nwho likely participated in the Work Program, let alone those who were aggrieved by it.  (Id. at \n32.)  Similarly, with regard to the testimony of the Adelanto warden, GEO contends that the \nnumber of workers eligible for kitchen work on a given day does not prove the number of workers \nactually participating.  (Id.)  GEO then points to Plaintiffs’ depositions and argues that Plaintiffs \npersonally knew only 21 to 38 individuals who “may” be potential class members.  (Id. at 33.)  \nPlaintiffs have no way of knowing, Defendant argues, who “voluntarily chose” to work.  (Id.)  \nDetainees might choose to work “for personal reasons” or because they “wished to make new \nfriends.”  (Id. at 34.)  As to the nationwide HUSP, Defendant objects that the Motion is devoid \nof evidence that the HUSPs applied at other facilities. \n \nb.  Analysis \n \nAs to the numbers of detainees who experience GEO’s HUSPs, the capacity of GEO \nfacilities is surely relevant, as the HUSPs allegedly apply throughout Adelanto and other GEO \nPage 16 of 28  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 223   Filed 11/26/19   Page 17 of 28   Page ID\n #:4548\nfacilities.  Although Plaintiffs only include details of the HUSP at Adelanto, GEO does not \nrespond to Plaintiffs’ argument that it conceded that the HUSPs are a companywide policy by \nfailing to respond to RFAs on this subject.  (Wright Decl. at Ex. 34.)  \n \nPlaintiffs also satisfy the numerosity requirement as to the Work Program-related classes \nby attaching evidence that large numbers of detainees participated in the Work Program.  GEO \nhas no response to Plaintiffs’ evidence that GEO requested reimbursement for more than 30,000 \nwork program shifts over roughly a year.  GEO also concedes that Plaintiffs alone knew up to 38 \nindividuals who participated in the work program.   \n \nAs to the number of detainees likely impacted by the alleged Uncompensated Work \nProgram, the Court notes the following evidence.  Plaintiffs attached a GEO form for detainees to \napply for paid position in the Work Program.  (Wright Decl. Ex. 17, Dkt. No. 193-17).  The form \nstates that 40 paid positions exist in the “work member detail program.”  (Id.)  On the same \nform, detainees are asked if they were willing to work voluntarily, if paid positions were filled.  \n(Id.)  The balance of the evidence is clear that a large number of individuals, far more than 40, \nparticipated in the Work Program over the months and years.  In combination with Plaintiffs’ \ndeclarations regarding uncompensated work details, the Court finds many detainees performed \nuncompensated labor.  The numerosity requirement is therefore satisfied. \n \n2.  Typicality of claims \n \nThe Court next turns to the typicality element of Rule 23(a). “The purpose of the \ntypicality requirement is to assure that the interest of the named representative aligns with the \ninterests of the class.”  Wolin v. Jaguar Land Rover North Am., LLC, 617 F.3d 1168, 1175 (9th \nCir. 2010).  “The test of typicality ‘is whether other members have the same or similar injury, \nwhether the action is based on conduct which is not unique to the named plaintiffs, and whether \nother class members have been injured by the same course of conduct.’”  Ellis v. Costco \nWholesale Corp., 657 F.3d 970, 984 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Hanon v. Dataproducts Corp., 976 \nF.2d 497, 508 (9th Cir. 1992)).  Thus, typicality is generally satisfied if the plaintiff’s claims are \n“reasonably co-extensive with those of absent class members; they need not be substantially \nidentical.” Caput v. NTT Sec. US Inc., 2019 WL 3308771, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 19, 2019) \n(quoting Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp, 150 F.3d 1011, 1020 (9th Cir. 1998)).  Moreover, satisfying the \ntypicality prong requires, in the least, that “a class representative must be part of the class.” \nGeneral Telephone Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 156 (1982). \n \na.  Contentions of the Parties \n \nPlaintiffs contend that they satisfy the typicality requirement, because they all suffered \nthe same alleged injury: they are current or former immigration detainees held at Adelanto, \nwhich applied the “same uniform policies and practices” to them, resulting in the “same injuries \nas all absent class members.”  (Mot. at 26.)  Each Plaintiff, and absent class member, claims they \nreceived no wages or below minimum wages and suffered the same kind of financial injury, \nbecause GEO threatened, or made detainees believe, that they would suffer physical or legal \nPage 17 of 28  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 223   Filed 11/26/19   Page 18 of 28   Page ID\n #:4549\nconsequences if they did not work, under the Uncompensated Work Program, Work Program, \nand Deprivation Policy  (Id.)  With regard to the HUSPs, each Plaintiff shares the same theory, \nthat they completed cleaning assignments because they were threatened with or were made to \nbelieve they would otherwise suffer “serious harm or physical restraint.”  (Mot at 26-27 (citing \nMenocal, 882 F.3d at 917.)    \n \nGEO argues that Plaintiffs’ concerns are not the result of a common policy, and that they \nwill be preoccupied fending off attacks on their individual credibility.  (Opp’n at 27.)  GEO \ncontends Plaintiffs never encountered adverse legal consequences and cannot point to any \nserious harm they suffered.  (Id.)  The company states Plaintiffs’ own declarations and \ncommissary records show they were not deprived of necessities such as soap, water, or \ntoothpaste, and could purchase candy and snacks.  (Id.)  Nor were Plaintiffs subjected to a \ncommon policy, because they were supervised by different guards or were in different dorms, and \nengaged in different cleaning tasks.  (Id. at 28.)  GEO also argues Plaintiffs cannot represent a \nnationwide class, because they have no knowledge of other facilities.  (Id. at 29.)  GEO concludes \nby challenging typicality based on (1) the different limitations periods applicable to each Plaintiff, \nand (2) Karim’s location in Somalia, which they argue puts him out of reach of this Court and \nwill consume class resources.  (Id. at 30-31.) \n \nPlaintiffs reply that the their somewhat different experiences are no bar to typicality if \nthey were subjected to a common practice or policy.  (Reply at 17 (citing Brown v. Abercrombie \n& Fitch Co., 2015 WL 9690357, at *15 (C.D. Cal. July 16, 2015).)  Similarly, Plaintiffs, who were \ndetained at Adelanto, can represent a nationwide class of individuals subjected to an “enterprise-\nwide policy or practice” such as the HUSP.  (Id.)  As to the statute of limitations argument, \nPlaintiffs point again to the Menocal decision, which found typicality where the named class \nrepresentatives were not detained for the full period of operation covered in the class definition.  \n(Id. at 18.)  As to Defendant’s argument regarding Karim, Plaintiffs state simply that his current \nlocation and status as a deportee do not impact the typicality analysis, which turns on the \ntypicality of his claims as compared to the class he wishes to represent. \n \nb.  Analysis \n \nThe key inquiry for typicality in this case is whether each Plaintiff states he suffered an \ninjury arising from each of the programs described.  If a Plaintiff did not suffer injury arising from \na program, he is not a member of a proposed class based on the alleged illegality of that program, \nand cannot represent members of the proposed class. \n \nThe Court begins by analyzing typicality with regard to the Work Program-related classes.  \nNovoa states he worked as a janitor and as a barber in the Work Program, (Novoa Decl. ¶¶ 7, 8).  \nHe states he participated in order to buy certain necessities.  (Id. ¶ 15.)  Fuentes similarly joined \nthe Work Program as a janitor, cleaning windows, floors, showers, bathrooms, and communal \nareas, and as a laundryman.  (Fuentes Decl. ¶¶ 7, 8).  He participated in order to obtain daily \nnecessities.  (Id. ¶ 11.)  Karim, likewise, participated as a porter, and in the kitchen, for the \npurpose of buying necessities.  (Karim Decl. ¶¶ 6, 8, 17.)  Finally, Mancia currently works in the \nPage 18 of 28  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 223   Filed 11/26/19   Page 19 of 28   Page ID\n #:4550\nkitchen under the Work Program, with a dozen others.  (Mancia Decl. ¶ 7.)  He works to buy \nnecessities such as food and hygiene items. \n \nThe Court finds Plaintiffs’ experiences typical of the proposed Work Program class.   \nAlthough their situations were not identical, they all have the same theory of injury, which if \nproven, could establish their California wage law, unfair competition, and unjust enrichment \nclaims.  Each Plaintiff provides evidence that GEO prevented him from doing outside work, and \nprovided the equipment and training necessary to complete required tasks.  All Plaintiffs \nparticipated in the same facility-wide Work Program policy, and for similar reasons.  Although \ntheir individual perceptions of need and motivations for joining the Work Program undoubtedly \nvary, Plaintiffs allege a facility-wide custom of providing insufficient daily necessities.10  The \nCourt therefore finds the typicality requirement satisfied for each named Plaintiff. \n \nNext, the Court considers the Uncompensated Work Program-related classes.  Novoa \ndoes not state in his declaration that he participated in Work Program crews without being paid, \nand so his claim is not typical of the Uncompensated Work Program Subclass, and he might not \nbe a member.  However, the remaining Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the proposed classes.  \nFuentes states he joined in work shifts and was sometimes paid nothing at all or was only given \nextra portions of food.  (Fuentes Decl. ¶ 9.)  Karim states he was not paid at all for his work as a \nporter for the first three months on the job and he was required to work for free before being \n“hired” into the work program.  (Karim Decl. ¶ 7.)  GEO officials also required him to work \nwithout compensation for certain periods after he was hired as a porter and before receiving pay \nfor kitchen work.  (Id. ¶¶ 7, 9.)  Mancia, who is still detained, works without pay as a porter.  \n(Mancia Decl. ¶ 8.)  As a result, three of the four named Plaintiffs suffered injuries and bring \nclaims typical of the Uncompensated Work Program Subclass.  The conduct they complain of is \nnot unique to them and they show a strong likelihood that other detainees may have been harmed \nin the same way. \n \n                                                 \n10 GEO’s Opposition includes a chart listing inconsistencies between the above-cited \ndeclarations and deposition testimony by each Plaintiff.  (Opp’n at 22.)  The chart is \nunpersuasive, because the cited discrepancies are trivial and do not rebut the gravamen of each \nPlaintiffs’ claim.  Some of the inconsistencies may be explained by the passage of time or \nlanguage differences.  For instance, GEO remarks that Karim declared he was denied hygiene \nitems, then later stated he was not familiar with deodorant.  (Opp’n at 25.)  But the deposition \ntranscript shows Karim did not recognize the word.  (DeLaney Decl. at Ex. D, pp. 30-31, 84 (“I \ndidn’t know English very well.”).)  Likewise, the fact that a detainee is sometimes provided with \nfree shampoo, soap, or toothpaste does not establish that there were not times they were not.  (Id. \nat 32 (“sometimes when you need it at the right time . . . they don’t used to give it to us.”).)  \nSimilarly unpersuasive is GEO’s emphasis on Plaintiffs’ purchase of unhealthy snacks such as \nchips, cookies, or candy.  Plaintiffs point out the commissary “does not sell fresh fruit, \nvegetables, lean proteins, or complex carbohydrates.”  (Reply at 15 (citing Hillers Decl. at Ex. \nS).) \nPage 19 of 28  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 223   Filed 11/26/19   Page 20 of 28   Page ID\n #:4551\nAs to the HUSP-related classes, Plaintiffs state as follows.  Novoa understood from his \nreview of the detainee handbook, refusing orders to clean subjects detainees to disciplinary \naction, and was threatened with disciplinary action on several occasions.  (Novoa Decl. ¶ 12.)  He \nwas forced to transfer units after complaining, and thought officers retaliated against him by \n“tossing” his cell.  (Id.).  Fuentes also cleaned areas of Adelanto for no compensation, but under \nthreat of being restricted to his cell or having rights, such as attorney visits, suspended.  (Fuentes \nDecl. ¶ 14.)  Karim states he had to clean areas of Adelanto, apparently outside the work \nprogram, without pay, including visitation areas, the kitchen, and the yard.  (Karim Decl. ¶ 10, \n11.)  Karim was threatened with disciplinary action, and found the threats credible based on his \nreview of the detainee handbook.  (Id. ¶ 13.)  Mancia notes that GEO officials routinely “require \ndetainees to clean areas of [Adelanto] for no compensation.”  (Mancia Decl. ¶ 10.)  He \npersonally has been instructed to paint the dining hall, clean the medical unit, and clean the \nrecreation yard.  (Id.)  Both Mancia and Karim state they believed, based on the handbook, they \ncould be disciplined for failure to complete such cleaning orders.  Based on these declarations and \nthe Adelanto policies comprising the HUSP submitted by Plaintiffs, the Court finds Plaintiffs \nsuffered the same or similar injuries, and satisfy typicality as to members of a nationwide HUSP \nclass.  The Court is also persuaded the injuries Plaintiffs allege are “reasonably co-extensive” \nwith those of detainees at other GEO facilities, in light of (1) the Menocal decision certifying a \nsimilar HUSP class, 320 F.R.D. 258, and GEO’s failure to respond to Plaintiffs’ RFAs or to \notherwise show similarly expansive sanitation policies do not exist at its other facilities.  Hanlon, \n150 F.3d at 1020. \n \nThe Court disagrees with GEO that Karim’s status as a deportee in Somalia makes him \natypical and thus an inappropriate class representative.  The Court also disagrees with Plaintiffs \nthat his current location has no bearing on the typicality analysis.  Although the focus of typicality \nis the injury claimed, it also extends to the interests of class members.  That Karim is located \noutside of the United States positions him well to represent the interests of others similarly \nsituated.  Certainly, the claims of the named Plaintiffs, including Karim, and the claims of class \nmembers “are so interrelated that the interests of the class members will be fairly and adequately \nprotected in their absence.”  Dukes, 564 U.S. at 349 n.5.  The geographic dispersion of class \nmembers speaks to the impracticability of joinder and the judicial economy of class certification.   \n \nNor does a difference in the amount of damages or the type of relief sought destroy \ntypicality for any of the proposed classes.  “[T]he mere fact that there might be differences in \ndamage calculations is not sufficient to defeat class certification.”  In re Hyundai & Kia Fuel \nEcon. Litig., 926 F.3d 539, 560 (9th Cir. 2019) (quoting Pulaski & Middleman, LLC v. Google, \nInc., 802 F.3d 979, 987 (9th Cir. 2015)); Leyva v. Medline Indus. Inc., 716 F.3d 510, 513–514 (9th \nCir. 2013) (holding the need for individualized damages determinations alone will not defeat \ncertification, even under the more stringent predominance requirement).  The typicality \nrequirement can be met notwithstanding varying fact patterns supporting class member claims, \nand this extends to disparity in damages by the representative plaintiffs.  The benchmark is \nsimilarity of interest and of injury. \n \nPage 20 of 28  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 223   Filed 11/26/19   Page 21 of 28   Page ID\n #:4552\nThe relevant statutes of limitation also do not preclude a finding of typicality here.  \nAlthough some district courts have rejected certification where the representative’s claims are \nsubject to a statute of limitations defense, Vizzi v. Mitsubishi Motors N. Am., Inc., 2010 WL \n11515266, at *2 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 22, 2010) (collecting cases), that is not GEO’s contention here.  \n(Opp’n at 29.)  GEO does not show that for each claim there is not at least one named Plaintiff \nwhose claim is within the limitations period, and only argues that the named Plaintiffs were \ndetained at different times.  Unlike many cases where courts have found typicality lacking, this \naction does not involve a sole named plaintiff whose claims are obviously time barred and where \ndenial of class certification, and dismissal of the action, would be warranted.   \n \nGEO also protests the fact that the cut-off date for the Nationwide HUSP class extends to \nDecember 2007, long before May 2011, the date GEO started operating Adelanto.  (Opp’n 1 n.2.)  \nPlaintiffs presumably chose this cut-off date because of the TVPA’s ten-year limitations period, \ncalculating back from the date they commenced the action.  The Court agrees the date would be \nunreasonable as applied to Adelanto.  But the proposed HUSP class is nationwide in scope. GEO \nmay have operated other facilities and applied the HUSPs prior to May 2011.  Thus, the \nproposed cut-off date is appropriate, with a clarification that members must have been at a facility \nwhile GEO operated it. \n \n3.  Commonality \n \nCourts have construed Rule 23(a)(2)’s commonality requirement permissively.  See \nStaton v. Boeing Co., 327 F.3d 938, 953 (9th Cir. 2003).  All questions of fact and law need not be \ncommon to satisfy the rule.  The existence of shared legal issues with divergent factual predicates \nis sufficient, as is “a common core of salient facts coupled with disparate legal remedies [within \nthe class].”  Jimenez v. Allstate Ins. Co., 765 F.3d 1161, 1165 (9th Cir. 2014) (quoting Hanlon, 150 \nF.3d at 1019).  Nevertheless, “[c]ommonality requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that the class \nmembers ‘have suffered the same injury,’” which “does not mean merely that they have all \nsuffered a violation of the same provision of law.”  Dukes, 131 S. Ct. at 2551 (citation omitted).  \nThe “claims must depend upon a common contention” and that common contention “must be \nof such a nature that it is capable of classwide resolution—which means that determination of its \ntruth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one \nstroke.”  Id.  The common question or questions must also generate common answers that will \nbe “apt to drive the resolution of the litigation,” which turns on the nature of the underlying \nlegal claims in the case.  Jimenez, 765 F.3d at 1165 (quoting Abdullah v. U.S. Sec. Associates, \nInc., 731 F.3d 952, 962 (9th Cir. 2013)).  Thus, commonality requires an understanding of the \nnature of the underlying claims.  Id. (citing Parsons v. Ryan, 754 F.3d 657, 676 (9th Cir. 2014)).  \n \na. Contentions of the Parties \n \nPlaintiffs point to several common questions of law or fact.  First, with regard to the \nAWC, there is the question of whether GEO is an “employer” of detained worker “employees” \nunder California minimum wage law; whether GEO violated California minimum wage law; \nwhether GEO was unjustly enriched by paying less than it was required to; and whether federal \nPage 21 of 28  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 223   Filed 11/26/19   Page 22 of 28   Page ID\n #:4553\nlaw preempts California minimum wage claims.  (Mot. at 22.)  The factual questions presented \ninvolve, among other questions:  GEO’s degree of control over detainee labor and rate of pay; \ntraining and equipment provided; and any restrictions on outside employment.  The “truth or \nfalsity” of Plaintiffs’ claims of an employee relationship turn on this same factual predicate.  (Id. \n(citing Wal-Mart, 564 U.S at 350).)  Plaintiffs point to evidence that the same WP (and by \nextension the same UWP) applies for all the class members at Adelanto.  (Id. citing Wright Decl. \nat Ex. 15 (attaching WP policy).)  They contend the nature of the relationship is the same for all \nputative class members.  (Id.) \n \nWith regard to the HUSP class, Plaintiffs state they will each have to demonstrate \nwhether GEO obtained their labor by improper means, including threats of harm, to satisfy the \nTVPA standard.  (Mot. at 24.)  The “lynchpin” of the serious harm analysis under the TVPA is \nwhether serious harm was threatened and whether the employer intended the employee to \nbelieve harm would occur.  (Id. at 23 (citing U.S. v. Dann, 652 F.3d 1160, 1170 (9th Cir. 2011).)  \nPlaintiffs state that the legal question is common to all: a reasonable person analysis, such that \none could determine whether the Defendant’s scheme compelled Plaintiffs, who were in a like \nsituation as immigration detainees, to work.  (Id. (citing Tanedo v. East Baton Rouge Parish \nSchool Board, 2011 WL 7095434 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 12, 2011).)  Common factual questions may \ninclude whether and how GEO forces, coerces or compels detainees at GEO immigration \ndetention centers nationwide to work for no pay, by requiring them to perform work beyond the \nfour personal housekeeping tasks in the PBNDS.  (Id. at 24.)  Plaintiffs point to Menocal for the \nproposition that the HUSP at Aurora applies uniformly.  (Id. (citing 320 F.R.D. 258 at 264).)  \nPlaintiffs state the Adelanto Forced Labor Class’s legal and factual questions will be substantially \nsimilar to those presented by the Nationwide HUSP Class.  (Id. at 24-25)   \n \nGEO approaches the commonality (and predominance) inquiry by pointing to factual \nquestions that may produce answers individual to each Plaintiff: (1) whether Plaintiffs were \ndeprived of “necessities” requiring them to work for a dollar a day; (2) whether they risked \nserious harm if they did not work; and (3) whether uncompensated work is required or permitted \nby ICE.  (Opp’n at 19.)  On the first point, they argue that the extent to which a particular \ndetainee felt compelled to participate in the VWP is “highly individualized,” because each \nPlaintiff has a different understanding of what constitutes a necessity.  (Id. at 17.)  Second, GEO \ncontests as a factual matter that any detainee was deprived of meals, water or necessities, or \nplaced in solitary confinement for failing to work.  (Opp’n at 19.)   Any alleged threat of harm, \nDefendant contends, is specific to each Plaintiff.  Third, GEO disputes that the HUSPs violate \nthe PBNDS, because ICE reviewed and signed off on the policies.  (Id. at 20 (citing Ragsdale \nDecl. ¶¶ 6-7).)  Similarly, each facility has its own “local policies” which reflect the PBNDS \nstandards, (id. citing ECF 193-4 at 9), and Plaintiffs cite no evidence regarding how an HUSP is \napplied at any other facility, (id.).   \n \nb.  Analysis: Commonality and Predominance \n \nThe Court analyzes commonality under Rule 23(a) and predominance under Rule \n23(b)(3) together, because the latter is an extension of the former, and is more stringent.  \nPage 22 of 28  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 223   Filed 11/26/19   Page 23 of 28   Page ID\n #:4554\nComcast Corp. v. Behrend, 133 S. Ct. 1426, 1432 (2013) (“Rule 23(b)’s predominance criterion is \neven more demanding than Rule 23(a) . . . Rule 23(b) requires that courts take a close look at \nwhether common questions predominate over individual ones.”) (citations omitted).  “The \npredominance inquiry asks whether the common, aggregation-enabling, issues in the case are \nmore prevalent or important than the non-common, aggregation-defeating, individual issues.  \nWhen one or more of the central issues in the action are common to the class and can be said to \npredominate, the action may be considered proper under Rule 23(b)(3) even though other \nimportant matters will have to be tried separately, such as damages or some affirmative defenses \npeculiar to some individual class members.”  Tyson Foods, Inc. v. Bouaphakeo, 136 S. Ct. 1036, \n1045 (2016) (citations and internal quotations omitted.) \n \nFirst, the Court notes the commonality and predominance analysis as to the Menocal \nHUSP Class and TVPA claim was exhaustively covered by the Menocal court.  Menocal, 320 \nF.R.D. 258, 265 (D. Colo. 2017) (finding commonality and predominance satisfied with respect \nto detainees’ TVPA claim, arising out of the HUSP at GEO’s Aurora Colorado facility).  \nMenocal is instructive, because Plaintiffs also bring TVPA (and related CTVPA) claims on behalf \nof the Adelanto Forced Labor Class, which they seek to certify under both Rule 23(b)(2) and \n(b)(3).  Unlike the Menocal plaintiffs, Plaintiffs here seek certification of the Nationwide HUSP \nClass only under 23(b)(2).  The District Court in Menocal found that common issues \npredominated in plaintiffs’ TVPA claim, and the Court agrees with that analysis.11  Thus, \n                                                 \n11 As described in Part II.C. above, the elements of a CTVPA and TVPA claim overlap \nsignificantly.  One key similarity is the reasonable person analysis, which is susceptible to class-\nwide resolution.  The first CTVPA element is whether the defendant “either deprived another \nperson of personal liberty or violated that other person’s personal liberty.”  Halim, 14 Cal. App. \n5th at 643.  The Cal. Penal Code defines deprivation or violation of personal liberty of another as:  \nsubstantial and sustained restriction of another’s liberty accomplished through \nforce, fear, fraud, deceit, coercion, violence, duress, menace, or threat of unlawful \ninjury to the victim or to another person, under circumstances where the person \nreceiving or apprehending the threat reasonably believes that it is likely that the \nperson making the threat would carry it out.  \n \nCal. Penal Code § 236.1(h)(3) (emphasis added).  Several aspects of this definition are \nsubject to class-wide demonstration, including (1) generalized threats or duress in the \nterms of the alleged policies, and (2) the question of whether a reasonable detainee would \nbelieve the threats. The second element of a CTVPA offense focuses on the defendant’s \nintent to obtain forced labor or services.  Here, the analysis would turn on Defendant’s \nalleged overall scheme, and under Plaintiffs’ case theory, the common questions in this \nregard would be overpowering.   \n \nSeveral courts have also found the CTVPA and TVPA to overlap.  See Lesnik v. \nEisenmann SE, 374 F. Supp. 3d 923, 954 (N.D. Cal. 2019) (allowing the  CTVPA claim to \nsurvive to the same extent as the Trafficking Victim Protection Reauthorization Act \n \nPage 23 of 28  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 223   Filed 11/26/19   Page 24 of 28   Page ID\n #:4555\nPlaintiffs have shown commonality and, where needed, predominance, for their TVPA and \nCTVPA claims.  These claims are relevant to the Nationwide HUSP Class and Adelanto Forced \nLabor subclasses. \n \nMenocal also analyzed the plaintiffs’ unjust enrichment claim under Colorado law, and \nfound that the claim does not compel individualized inquiry.  320 F.R.D. at 268.  There is a split \nof authority in California regarding whether unjust enrichment is an independent cause of action, \nor merely another name for restitution.  See Kosta v. Del Monte Corp., 2013 WL 2147413, at *14 \nn.8 (N.D. Cal. May 15, 2013) (explaining split of authority).  The Court agrees with those cases \nholding that unjust enrichment is not an independent cause of action, and is only a claim for \nrestitution.  See Ang v. Bimbo Bakeries USA, Inc., 2013 WL 5407039, at *11 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 25, \n2013) (citing Hill v. Roll Internat. Corp., 195 Cal. App. 4th 1295, 1307 (2011) (“Unjust \nenrichment is not a cause of action, just a restitution claim.”)).  Thus, the Court focuses its \nanalysis on the commonality, and eventually the predominance, aspects of Plaintiffs’ remaining \ncauses of action on behalf of the Adelanto Wage Class. \n \nThe Court finds that the commonality and predominance requirements of Rule 23 are \nsatisfied as to the California wage law and unfair competition claims.  Each Plaintiff and proposed \nclass member would bring the same state law causes of action with the same elements, and the \nelements subject to common proof would predominate.   \n \nFirst, the Court examines the wage law claim.  Whether GEO may be deemed an \n“employer” under the alternative definitions in Martinez v. Combs, is a dominating question \nshared by Plaintiffs and the putative Adelanto Work Program class members.  Their claims of an \nemployment relationship hinge on the terms and features of GEO’s Work Program, \nUncompensated Work Program, and HUSP, which apply uniformly throughout Adelanto.  It is \nwell-established that “[P]redominance in employment cases is rarely defeated on the grounds of \ndifferences among employees so long as liability arises from a common practice or policy of an \nemployer.”  Senne v. Kansas City Royals Baseball Corp., 934 F.3d 918, 938 (9th Cir. 2019) \n(quoting 7 Newberg on Class Actions § 23:33 (5th ed. 2012)).  Blanket corporate policies “often \nbear heavily on questions of predominance and superiority.”  Id. (quoting In re Wells Fargo \nHome Mortg. Overtime Pay Litig., 571 F.3d 953, 958 (9th Cir. 2009)).  Here, Plaintiffs claim \nGEO exercised control over their hours or working conditions, and/or “suffer[ed] to permit \n                                                 \n(“TVPRA”) claim); Lesnik v. Eisenmann SE, 2018 WL 4700342, at *15 (N.D. Cal. Oct. \n1, 2018) (“[T]he California statutes at issue mirror the TVPRA.”).  The abbreviations \nTVPA and TVPRA are used interchangeably.  Since the passage of the TVPA in 2000,  \nPublic L. No. 106-386, 114 Stat 1464 (2000), several reauthorizations have been passed \namending the TVPA.  For example, the TVPRA of 2003 created a civil right of action for \na victim of criminal trafficking offenses, see Public L. No. 108-193, 117 Stat 2875 (2003), \nand the 2008 reauthorization extended the civil remedy provision to allow recovery \nagainst “whoever knowingly benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value . . . .”  \nPublic. L. No. 110-457 § 221, 122 Stat. 5044 (2008).  \nPage 24 of 28  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 223   Filed 11/26/19   Page 25 of 28   Page ID\n #:4556\n[them] to work” under the same uniform policies or company-wide practices.  Martinez, 49 Cal. \n4th at 64. \n \nSecond, common questions will predominate for Plaintiffs’ unfair competition claim, \nwhich is derivative of the underlying wage law violation.  California’s Unfair Competition Law is \na broad remedial statute that permits an individual to challenge wrongful business conduct “in \nwhatever context such activity might occur.”  Cel–Tech Commc’ns, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular \nTele. Co., 20 Cal. 4th 163 (1999).  A claim under California’s Unfair Competition Law requires a \nshowing of either an unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent business act or practice, or an unfair, \ndeceptive, untrue, or misleading advertising.  Lundy v. Selene Finance, LP, 2016 WL 1059423, at \n*17 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 17, 2016) (citing Steward v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am., 388 F. Supp. 2d 1138, \n1143 (E.D. Cal. 2005)).  Here, the Adelanto Wage Class’s claim of unfairness does not hinge on \nany individualized inquiry specific to Plaintiffs.  Rather they claim GEO fraudulently, unfairly, or \nunlawfully induced them to work under the same Adelanto and Nationwide policies.  GEO \ncannot explain why it would be fairer to induce a detainee to scrub a kitchen sink for free than to \nwax hallway floors, or less fraudulent to induce under threat of discipline a wealthy detainee to \nwork as compared to an indigent one.  Nor do Work Program participants agree to work as a \nresult of their arms-length negotiations with GEO that vary meaningfully from detainee to \ndetainee.  They fill out the same application and work under the same conditions.  Finally, \nPlaintiffs’ Unfair Competition claim involves the market incentives to marshal detainee labor for \ncompetitive advantage over rival detention companies that follow the strict letter of the PBNDS, \nor provide more favorable conditions than required by ICE.  As a result, the Court finds common \nissues as to the Unfair Competition Law claim, and also finds that those common issues \npredominate over any individual questions. \n \n4.  Adequacy \n \n Under Rule 23(a)(4), the named plaintiffs must be deemed capable of adequately \nrepresenting the interests of the entire class, including absent class members.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(a)(4) (requiring “representative parties [who] will fairly and adequately protect the interests \nof the class”).  The adequacy inquiry turns on: (1) whether the named plaintiff and class counsel \nhave any conflicts of interest with other class members, and (2) whether the representative \nplaintiff and class counsel can vigorously prosecute the action on behalf of the class.  See Ellis, \n657 F.3d at 985.  Furthermore, pursuant to Rule 23(g), before appointing class counsel, the Court \n“must consider” the following matters: \n \ni.  the work counsel has done in identifying or investigating potential claims \nin the action; \nii.  counsel’s experience in handling class actions, other complex litigation, \nand the types of claims asserted in the action; \niii.  counsel’s knowledge of the applicable law; and \niv.  the resources that counsel will commit to representing the class \n \nPage 25 of 28  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 223   Filed 11/26/19   Page 26 of 28   Page ID\n #:4557\nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1)(A).  The Court “may” also consider “any other matter pertinent to \ncounsel’s ability to fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(g)(1)(B). \n \na.  Contentions of the Parties \n \nPlaintiffs and their counsel state they can vigorously pursue the action on behalf of the \nclass, and that counsel has the requisite experience and resources to litigate this complex case.  \n(Mot. at 27.)  GEO counters that the class representatives are not honest or credible and may \nhave to devote their resources to defending character attacks.  (Opp’n at 21.)  They include in the \nbody of their briefing a chart “providing specific details of each Plaintiffs’ dishonest statements \nmade under oath.”  (Id. at 22-26.) \n \nb.  Analysis \n \nThe Court discerns no conflict of interest between Plaintiffs, class counsel, and putative \nclass members.  Similarly, each Plaintiff has declared he understands the responsibilities of being \na class representative and is prepared to cooperate with counsel, and to pursue the interests of all \nclass members.  (Novoa Decl. ¶ 19; Fuentes Decl. ¶ 17; Karim Decl. ¶ 20; Mancia Decl. ¶ 17.)  \nGEO challenges Plaintiffs’ adequacy as representatives only on grounds of credibility.  The Court \nhas already dismissed the challenge as unpersuasive.12   \n \nThe Court has reviewed the declarations of Plaintiffs’ counsel and attached credentials \nand finds they are qualified to vigorously pursue the case on behalf of the class, based on \nexperience handling other class actions.  (Charest Decl.; Wolfson Decl.; Free Decl.)  At least one \nattorney is licensed to practice law in California, and all counsel have significant federal court \nexperience.  Counsel state they have the resources and staff necessary, and are able to advance \nthe costs of litigation.  (Wolfson Decl. ¶ 5.)  Based on the extensive exhibits submitted in support \nof the Motion, the Court also concludes counsel has sufficiently investigated the claims.  In sum, \nPlaintiffs and their counsel have satisfied the adequacy requirements. \n \nD. Rule 23(b) Requirements \n \nRule 23(b) establishes three categories of class action, and each proposed class much fit \ninto one of the three categories authorized.  It is not unusual for a proposed class to be certified \nunder more than one category.  5 Moore’s Federal Practice - Civil § 23.40 (2019). \n \n1.  Rule 23(b)(2) \n \nPlaintiffs seek certification of three classes under Rule 23(b)(2): the Adelanto Forced \nLabor class (divided into a Work Program and Uncompensated Work Program class), and a \nNationwide HUSP Class.  GEO presents no argument specific to the requirements of Rule \n                                                 \n12 Supra note 10. \nPage 26 of 28  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 223   Filed 11/26/19   Page 27 of 28   Page ID\n #:4558\n23(b)(2), and focuses its Opposition on the prerequisites applicable to all class actions under Rule \n23(a).  \n \nIn the Ninth Circuit, “[i]t is sufficient to meet the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) [when] \nclass members complain of a pattern or practice that is generally applicable to the class as a \nwhole.”  Rodriguez v. Hayes, 591 F.3d 1105, 1125 (9th Cir. 2010) (internal citation and quotation \nmarks omitted) (finding certification under Rule 23(b)(2) proper where “proposed members of \nthe class each challenge Respondents’ practice of prolonged detention of detainees without \nproviding a bond hearing and seek as relief a bond hearing with the burden placed on the \ngovernment”).  \n \nThis case concerns various policies and practices applicable to each proposed class that, if \nunlawful, subject proposed members to coerced labor in violation of the TVPA and CTVPA.  \nThe classes also seek essentially the same injunctive relief enjoining GEO from continuing these \npolicies or practices.  (Mot. at 28.)  Rule 23(b)(2)’s requirements are therefore satisfied here.  \nHayes, 591 F.3d at 1125; Parsons v. Ryan, 754 F.3d 657, 689 (9th Cir. 2014) (Rule 23(b)(2) \nsatisfied where state department of corrections established policies and practices that placed \n“every inmate in [] custody in peril” and all class members sought essentially the same injunctive \nrelief).   \n \n2.  Rule 23(b)(3) \n \nPlaintiffs seek certification of three 23(b)(3) classes: the Adelanto Wage Class, and the \ntwo Adelanto Forced Labor Subclasses.  The Court has already addressed the predominance \naspect of claims relevant to these classes, in Part III.C.3 above.  The remaining analysis therefore \nfocuses on superiority, a pragmatic evaluation of the entire action.  After consideration of the \nguidelines in Rule 23(b)(3)(A)-(D) the Court finds that a class action is the superior method of \nadjudication of the claims.  \n \n  GEO argues that the vulnerable position of proposed class members, who may be located \nin different states or countries or may be undocumented, weighs against superiority.  (Opp’n at \n34-35.)  But the fact class members may otherwise be unable to bring their claims due to their \ntenuous situations only militates in favor of certification.  Gunnells v. Healthplan Servs., 348 F.3d \n417, 426 (4th Cir. 2003) (superiority was shown when, in absence of class certification, very few \nindividual claims would be brought, because adjudication through class action is superior to no \nadjudication at all); Menocal, 320 F.R.D. at 270 (“[M]any of the putative class members are \nimmigrant detainees who lack English proficiency.  They have limited financial resources and \nreside in countries around the world.  It is very likely that these claims would not be brought by \nindividual detainees, especially considering the case’s innovative nature.”).  GEO’s argument \nagainst superiority fails, because it does not point to any alternate means of resolution of \ndetainees’ claims.  Thus, the superiority analysis here is somewhat truncated by the lack of \nalternate means.  Fear of negative immigration consequences may also deter individual claims, a \nfact that also weighs in favor of certification.  Rodriguez v. Carlson, 166 F.R.D. 465, 479–480 \nPage 27 of 28  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 223   Filed 11/26/19   Page 28 of 28   Page ID\n #:4559\n(E.D. Wash. 1996) (class action was preferred where social factors otherwise deterred individual \nlitigation by migrant workers.) \n \nThe Court is aware of other lawsuits asserting the claims brought in this case, in \nparticular with regard to the proposed Nationwide HUSP Class.  However, Plaintiffs scope the \nNationwide HUSP Class to exclude the Aurora Colorado GEO facility, and thus avoid the \ncreation of a direct overlap with Menocal.  Although it is likely some individuals were detained \nboth at the Aurora Colorado facility and facilities covered by the Nationwide HUSP Class, the \nCourt does not detect any prejudice that would result to class members by certification of the \nnationwide class.  Nor does the Court find problematic any overlap between the classes proposed \nhere and the recently certified Nwauzor class action.  (Wright Decl. at Ex. 1 (attaching order \nfrom Nwauzor v. GEO Group, Inc., No. 17-5769 (W.D. Wash. Sept. 27, 2019)).)  The Nwauzor \nclass only includes detainees who participated in the Work Program at GEO’s Northwest \nDetention Center.  (Wright Decl. at Ex. 1.)  Conceivably some members of the Nationwide \nHUSP Class would also be members of the Nwauzor class, but they would be asserting claims \narising from different GEO policies.  The Court also notes that a member of Plaintiffs’ Counsel, \nR. Andrew Free, is class counsel in both the Nwauzor and the Menocal actions, and so conflict in \nstrategy to the detriment of class members is unlikely. \n \nIV.   CONCLUSION \n \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court (1) GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion for class \ncertification; (2) DENIES Defendant’s motion to exclude; and (3) VACATES the hearing set for \nDecember 2, 2019 on the motion to exclude.  A separate class certification order will be filed \nconcurrently herewith, defining the classes and appointing class counsel. \n \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n \nPage 28 of 28  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n ",

I am the Facility Administrator at the Pine Prairie ICE Processing Center \n9 \n(\"Pine Prairie Facility\"). I am over the age of eighteen (18), and I am competent to \n10 \ntestify in this matter. My statement is based upon my personal knowledge, and my \n11 \neducation, training, and experience. \nc2v.  'rt.?1 2 \n1.  The Pine Prairie Facility has implemented rigorous processes to avoid the \nexposure of the detainee population to COVID-19 and to ensure that procedures are put \n14 \nin place to avoid the spread of COVID-19 in the event that COVID-19 were to be \n15 \nintroduced to the Pine Prairie Facility. \nV4.-)16 \n2.  To date, there have been two incidents of COVID-19 at Pine Prairie. Both \nro2 \n17 \ng  incidents have been contained  consistent with the Center  for Disease Control  and \n18 \nPrevention's (\"CDC\")  recommendations. \n19 \n3.  The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the Pine Prairie Facility resulted \n20 \nfrom a recent transfer from Oakdale Federal Prison. The individual tested positive at \n21 \nthe time of his transfer from the Oakdale Federal Prison. The individual has been held \n22 \nin medical isolation, with constant medical care, since his arrival. He has not had any \n23 \ncontact with other detainees in the facility. When the individual arrived at Pine Prairie, \n24 \nhe was asymptomatic. On Friday, April  10, 2020, I received the results of a test \n25 \nadministered by our facility which came back negative. The individual was tested \n26 \nagain to confirm the negative result. On April 13, 2020, I received the results of a \n27 \n28  52702647;1 \n2    CASE No. 5:17-cv-02514-.10B-SHICx \nDECLARATION OF ERIC STAIGER IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANT THE GEO GROUP, INC.'S \nOPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 262-1   Filed 04/13/20   Page 4 of 63   Page ID\n #:5729\n1  second test for the individual, that test also came back negative. As of the date of this \n2  declaration, two tests have confirmed that the individual is negative for COVID-19. \n3  Because the detainee has tested negative two times, he will be transferred out of the \n4  Pine Prairie facility in the very near future. \n5  4.  The second confirmed case of COVID-19 was a detainee who arrived at \n6  the facility late last week. Upon arrival he was taken for a medical examination as part \n7  of his intake screening process. During his medical screening presented with symptoms \n8  and was immediately isolated. He was tested by the medical staff at the facility and on \n9  Friday night, his results came back positive for COVID-19. He remains in medical \n10  isolation  with  constant  care.  He  did  not  and  has  not  had  any  contact  with  any \n11  individual who was already detained within the facility. He did have contact with other \nFr-7012  individuals  who  travelled  with  him  to  the  facility  and  arrived  for  intake.  Every \nqa13  individual who travelled with detainee who presented symptoms at intake (and later \n8414  tested positive for COVID-19) has been housed in an isolated unit away from other \n: \n015 \ndetainees. None of those detainees have experienced symptoms of COVID-19. If they \nir;16  do, they will be medically isolated and tested. \n17  5.  Our  facility  is  in  possession  of  additional  tests  and  they  will  be \n18  administered consistent with the CDC guidelines and advice of medical professionals. \n19  6.  Attached as Exhibit A is a true and correct copy of the CDC Interim \n20  Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional \n21  and Detention  Facilities.  GEO utilized this guidance  to  educate  its personnel  and \n22  detainees  at  the Pine  Prairie  Facility  about  COVID-19.  GEO  further  utilized  this \n23  guidance  to  develop  its  policies  and  practices  for  addressing  COVID-19.  My \n24  declaration  below  provides  some  specifics  about  GEO's  implementation  of  the \n25  guidelines at Pine Prairie Facility. I have not attempted to describe in totality each and \n26  every action taken by the facilities and GEO staff to implement the guidelines or any \n27 \n28  52702647;1 \n3  CASE NO, 5:17-cv-02514-IGB-SHKx \nDECLARATION OF ERIC STAIGER IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANT THE GEO GROUP, INC.'S \nOPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 262-1   Filed 04/13/20   Page 5 of 63   Page ID\n #:5730\n1  other  precautions.  nor  could  I  do  so  within  the  limitations  of  a  publicly  filed \n2  declaration. However, I hope to convey to the Court that GEO is being proactive and is \n3  taking COVID-19 seriously to reduce the risk of infection. \n4  7.  The health, safety, and well-being of detainees at Pine Prairie Facility \n5  correlates with the health, safety, and well-being of GEO staff, GEO administration, \n6  and our families. Our interests are aligned with respect to mitigation strategies to slow \n7  the spread of the coronavirus and resulting infections of COVID-19. \n8  8.  GEO  has  held  multiple  town  hall  meetings  for  detainees,  since  the \n9  beginning of March about COVID-19. These meetings include medical professionals \n10  who answer detainees' questions about COVID-19 and keep detainees aware of the \n11  ongoing situation. \neV?,.' 12  9.  As with all others across the country, we are continuing to evolve our \n13  practices  as  we  learn  more  about  COVID-19.  We  continue  to  implement \nrp. 14  supplementary  safety  measures,  in  addition  to those  listed  below,  as  information \n0 115  becomes available. \n1$1,16  Social  Distancin4  and Access Limitations \n§I17  10.  The Pine Prairie Facility has implemented a number of limitations, in \n18  connection  with  ICE,  to  reduce  the  introduction  of  any  outside  sources  of \n19  contamination into the facility. \n20  11.  Limited Visitation:  ICE has temporarily stopped all in-person visitation \n21  for detainees and their family and friends with the exception of detainees' attorney \n22  visits.  Attorneys  who  wish  to  enter  the  building  must  wear  Personal  Protective \n23  Equipment  (\"PPE\")  including  an  N-95  or  surgical  masks,  goggles,  and  gloves. \n24  Otherwise, all visits are restricted to videoconferencing on tablets that are provided to \n25  detainees and telephone interviews with attorneys. \n26  12.  An\\ one Entering the Pine Prairie Facility : Any individual who enters the \n27 \n28  52702647;1 \n4  CASE No. 5:17-cv-02514-.10B-SHM\nDECLARATION OF ERIC STAIGER IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANT THE GEO GROUP, INC.'S \nOPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 262-1   Filed 04/13/20   Page 6 of 63   Page ID\n #:5731\nfacility  must  first  complete  a  screening  questionnaire  to  determine  whether  the \n2  individual has a likelihood of exposure to COVID-19. This includes all GEO staff; \n3  medical staff, ICE personnel, and other regular personnel within the building, as well \n4  as those who arrive for purposes of attending proceedings at the immigration court \n5  within  the  Pine Prairie Facility. Thereafter, GEO staff take the  temperature of all \n6  individuals seeking entry. Anyone who presents with a fever must return home until \n7  cleared by a medical professional. Staff are not permitted to work when they are sick \n8  and are advised to stay home if they develop symptoms of COVID-19 or come into \n9  contact with someone who has been exposed. All staff who are potentially exposed \n10  have been instructed to follow CDC guidelines for self isolation and medical care. \n11  13.  Contractors:  Non-emergency  contractors  are  not  presently  permitted \ng  (4\n12  within the Pine Prairie facility. \n14.  Incoming Detainees: The Pine Prairie Facility has also placed restrictions \n4a 13\n14  on any new detainees who arrive at the facility for detention. All detainees are screened \nVei 15  for COVID-19 exposure upon arrival at the facility, before entering the secure portion \nE-1  I2 of the facility. After a medical professional confirms that there are no clinical signs of \npc \n17  COVID-19,  and  that  their  travel  history  does  not  raise  significant  concerns  of \n18  exposure, each incoming detainee must undergo a minimum of a fourteen-day waiting \n19  period before being housed in the general population. This procedure allows GEO to \n20  address concerns that new individuals who are asymptomatic may be carrying COVID-\n21  19. During this period, new detainees are regularly checked by medical professionals \n22  for  symptoms.  If a  detainee  were to  present  concerns  of exposure  to  COVID-19 \n23  because of his or her symptoms, the detainee would be placed in a negative pressure \n24  medical  holding  cell,  or  alternatively, would  be  denied  access to  the  facility. All \n25  detainees who cannot verify their travel history, or who have been to areas considered \n26  \"hot spots,\" are placed immediately in medical isolation or denied access to the facility \n27 \n28  52702647;1 \n5    CASE No. 5:17-ov-025144GB-SHECx \nDECLARATION OF ERIC STAIGER IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANT THE GEO GROUP, INC.'S \nOPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 262-1   Filed 04/13/20   Page 7 of 63   Page ID\n #:5732\n1  if space is unavailable. All medically isolated individuals are checked daily by medical \n2  staff. This procedure has been effective, as GEO was able to isolate the asymptomatic \n3  individual  who was transferred  from Oakdale Federal  Prison from the rest of the \n4  population using these techniques. \n5  15.  Social Distancing within Living Units: GEO has opened additional living \n6  units to provide for additional space for each detainee in his or her living unit. As a \n7  result, the current population in each pod or dorm significantly less than total capacity \n8  of each unit. All meals served in the dining hall are served to 45 or fewer detainees at a \n9  time, when typical capacity is double that. Detainees are able to maintain a 6  foot \n10  distance between each other when getting their meal and eating their meal. \n11  16.  Social Distancing for Other Activities:  GEO has temporarily ended all \nNrr\n12  visits from volunteers to reduce the exposure to outside pathogens. Detainees may still \nRE:41' \n'13  use  the  law  library,  but  social  distancing  is  practiced  by  limiting  the  number  of \nHa\n14  individuals in the law library at any one time. Detainees may still engage in recreation \nff 115  but the number of individuals engaged at a time is limited to a number whereby six (6) \n1t0 3\n^16  feet of distance can be maintained between each detainee. Detainees no longer share \nE-` \n17  recreation time with other housing units and instead are limited to interactions with \n18  their own housing units. Further, staff has been instructed to clean and disinfect all \n19  equipment between each use. \n20  17.  Detainees Who Leave the Facilit  for Medical or Other Appointments: \n21  Detainees who must attend medical appointments or immigration-case related meetings \n22  off of the premises of the Pine Prairie facility are immediately placed in restrictive \n23  housing upon their return for a minimum of 14 days in an effort to reduce concerns the \n24  detainee could have been exposed to COVID-19 while in the community and prevent \n25  any unintended spread of the same. \n26  Enhanced Hv  Practices \nkl,iene \n27 \n28  52702647;1 \n6    CASE No. 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SliKx \nDECLARATION OF ERIC STAIGER IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANT THE GEO GROUP, INC.'S \nOPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 262-1   Filed 04/13/20   Page 8 of 63   Page ID\n #:5733\n1  18.  Supplies: I have assessed GEO' s stock of soap and cleaning supplies and \n2  all supplies are stocked and not at risk of depleting in the near future. Further, there are \n3  supplies to provide hand sanitizer in strategic areas throughout the facility. I have a \n4  plan in place to keep supply stocks replenished as needed. GEO uses EPA approved \n5  cleaning products that have been demonstrated to be effective against the coronavirus, \n6  more specifically HDQ cleaning product which appears on \"List N\" of the EPA's \n7  approved  list  of  cleaners.  That  list  can  be  accessed  here: \n8     s: //www.e pa  .g ov/pesticide-re aistrationilist-n-disinfectants-use-aviainst-sars-cov-2. \n9  The Pine Prairie Facility currently has an ample supply of this cleaning product, which \n10  is used to disinfect all hard surfaces. \n11  19.  Intensified  Cleaninit.  GEO  has  implemented  intensified  cleaning  of \n:40.12  surfaces and objects that are frequently touched, both inside and outside of the secured \nord--13  perimeter. GEO staff must sanitize all hard surfaces and high-touch areas multiple \n:114 \ntimes during each officer's shift, including tables, doorknobs, telephones. GEO uses \ne; \n'I 15  EPA-registered disinfectants that are represented to be effective against the virus that \n16  causes COVID - 19. GEO is not diluting disinfectants below effective levels. GEO has \n§9017  gloves for use with cleaning. Detainees are issued these gloves to clean. Detainees \n18  have not complained about the availability of cleaning supplies. Detainees have access \n19  to additional bottles of disinfectant in their housing units. \n20  20.  Reinforced Hygiene: GEO has reinforced healthy Hygiene practices and \n21  has made supplied available to encourage safe hygiene practices. GEO plays a video \n22  on a loop in all housing areas that demonstrates the proper handwashing technique. \n23  This video is also available on detainee tablets. GEO has also made the information \n24  attached as Exhibit   B available to all detainees. \n25  21.  Staff PPE Use: GEO staff have been issued surgical masks within the past \n26  week. Going forward each GEO staff member will receive three (3) masks a week with \n27 \n28  52702647;1 \n7    CASE No. 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHKx \nDECLARATION OF ERIC STAIGER IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANT TEE GEO GROUP, INC.'S \nOPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 262-1   Filed 04/13/20   Page 9 of 63   Page ID\n #:5734\n1  instructions for their use and disposal. \n2  22.  To my knowledge, ICE continues to release detainees who are identified \n3  as high risk as it relates to contraction of the COVID-19 virus. \n4  23.  All detainees are provided with soap and may replenish their soap anytime \n5  it runs out. There is no risk that detainees do not receive soap. \n6  I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States of America \n7  that the foregoing is true and correct and that I executed this Declaration on the 13th \n8  day of April, 2020, in Pine Prairie, Louisiana. \n9 \n10 \n) \n11  Eric Staiger, Declarant \ne•t \nRH. 12 \nr0:14 \nzu. \nEr:1315 \na16 \n0 °4 \ng9,:i \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  52702647;1 \n8    CASE No. 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHICx \nDECLARATION OF ERIC STAIGER IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANT THE GEO GROUP, INC.'S \nOPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER ",

This action arises from systematic and unlawful wage theft, unjust enrichment, and \n3  forced  labor  at  the  nation’s  deadliest  civil  immigration  detention  facility—California’s  Adelanto \n4  Detention Center (the “Adelanto Facility” or the “Facility”).  \n5  2.  The Adelanto Facility is a civil immigration detention facility owned and operated for \n6  profit by Defendant The GEO Group, Inc. (“GEO”). \n7  3.  GEO is a multibillion-dollar corporation that owns and operates detention facilities \n8  around the world. GEO has made tens of millions of dollars in profits from its contract to run the \n9  Adelanto Facility.  \n10  4.  Although it is contractually required to provide for all essential detention services at \n11  the Facility, GEO uses the nearly-free labor of detainees to perform these services in order to \n12  maximize profits. \n13  5.  GEO pays detainees just $1 per day to maintain and operate the Facility.      \n14  6.  This labor is not voluntary in any meaningful sense. GEO maintains a corporate \n15  policy and uniform practice at the Adelanto Facility of withholding necessary care from its detainees \n16  to ensure a ready supply of available labor needed to operate the Facility. As a result, detainees are \n17  forced to submit to GEO’s $1 per day scheme in order to buy the basic necessities – including food, \n18  water, and hygiene products – that GEO refuses to provide for them.   \n19  7.  GEO maintains a corporate policy and uniform practice at the Adelanto Facility of \n20  threatening detainees who refuse to work with disciplinary segregation or solitary confinement, \n21  reporting their actions to the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”), or \n22  referring them for criminal prosecution. These abusive practices and threats of abuse ensure that \n23  detainees will continue working for subminimum wages. \n24  8.  GEO significantly reduces its labor costs and expenses, and increases its already vast \n25  profits, by unlawfully forcing and coercing detainees to perform labor at subminimum wages.  These \n26  policies and practices violate California minimum wage law, the California Unfair Competition Law, \n27  and federal and state Trafficking Victims Protection Acts, which prohibit forced labor.  \n28 \n  2   \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514   Document 1   Filed 12/19/17   Page 3 of 18   Page ID #:3\n \n1  9.  Plaintiff Raul Novoa, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, brings \n2  this class action lawsuit to stop the economic exploitation of detainees at the Adelanto Facility, to \n3  recover unpaid wages, and to remedy the unjust enrichment resulting from GEO’s unlawful failure to \n4  pay its detainee workforce legal wages.           \n5  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n6  10.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 because this \n7  action arises under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1589 et seq. \n8  11.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the Class Action Fairness Act \n9  of 2005, 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d), because at least one class member is of diverse citizenship from one \n10  defendant; there are more than 100 class members; the aggregate amount in controversy exceeds \n11  $5,000,000; and minimal diversity exists. \n12  12.  Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) because the events or \n13  omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in this District. \n14  13.  This Court has personal jurisdiction over GEO because the corporation regularly \n15  conducts business in California, and has sufficient minimum contacts with California.    \n16  14.  Plaintiff  requests  that  this  Court  exercise  supplemental  jurisdiction  pursuant  to \n17  28 U.S.C. § 1367 over their state law claims arising under the California Minimum Wage Order, the \n18  California Unfair Competition Law, and California common law.  \n19  PARTIES \n20  15.  Plaintiff Raul Novoa is an adult resident of Los Angeles, California. He is a lawful \n21  permanent resident with longstanding family and community ties in the Los Angeles area.  From \n22  2012 through 2015, Mr. Novoa was detained at the Adelanto Facility.  During those three years, he \n23  was employed by GEO as a janitor and a barber. He was paid only $1 per day for his labor, regardless \n24  of how many hours he worked.   \n25  16.  Defendant GEO is a for-profit corporation providing correctional, detention, and \n26  community reentry services. GEO is a Florida corporation, with its principal office located at 624 \n27  NW 53rd Street, Suite 700, Boca Raton, Florida 33487.  \n28 \n  3   \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514   Document 1   Filed 12/19/17   Page 4 of 18   Page ID #:4\n \n1  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n2  A.  Immigration detention is civil—not criminal.  \n3  17.  Each  year,  hundreds  of  thousands  of  individuals  are  detained  in  geographically \n4  isolated  immigration  detention  facilities  while  awaiting  immigration  or  citizenship  status \n5  determinations.  These  detainees  include  U.S.  citizens,  lawful  permanent  residents  (green  card \n6  holders) with longstanding family and community ties, survivors of torture, asylum seekers, victims \n7  of human trafficking, children, and pregnant women.  \n8  18.  Some detainees, like Mr. Novoa, were brought to the United States as children. And \n9  thousands  ultimately  have  their  United  States  citizenship  or  legal  residency  affirmed  by  an \n10  immigration court or federal judge. \n11  19.  Immigration  violations  are  civil  violations,  and  immigration  detention  is  civil  in \n12  nature.1 Many detainees have no criminal history at all.   \n13  20.  Notwithstanding  immigration  detention’s  civil  nature  and  purpose,  detainees  are \n14  often subjected to prison-like conditions. According to Dora Schriro, former head of ICE’s Office of \n15  Detention Policy and Planning, most detainees are held – systematically and unnecessarily – under \n16  circumstances  inappropriate  for  immigration  detention’s  noncriminal  purposes.2    Detainees  are \n17  frequently subjected to punitive and long-term solitary confinement, inadequate medical care, sexual \n18  and physical assault, and other harsh conditions of confinement, all without a conviction. \n19  21.  Many detainees submit to deportation simply to obtain release from these intolerable \n20  conditions, even when they have valid claims to remain in the United States, including claims to \n21  asylum or other discretionary relief.      \n22  B.  The privatization of immigration detention and GEO’s economic windfall. \n23  22.  Immigration detention expanded roughly eightfold over the past two decades, from a \n24  capacity of 5,532 detention beds in 19943 to a current capacity of over 41,000.4  \n                                                 \n25 \n1 See Fong Yue Ting v. United States, 149 U.S. 698, 728–30 (1893) (observing that deportation proceedings have “all the \nelements of a civil case” and are “in no proper sense a trial or sentence for a crime or offense”). \n26 \n2 Dora Schriro, U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., Immigration Detention Overview and Recommendations 10, 15 (2009). \n3 Sharita Gruberg, How For-Profit Companies are Driving Immigration Detention Policies, Center for American \n27 \nProgress (Dec. 18, 2015), available at \nhttps://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/reports/2015/12/18/127769/how-for-profit-companies-are-\n28 \ndriving-immigration-detention-policies/  \n  4   \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514   Document 1   Filed 12/19/17   Page 5 of 18   Page ID #:5\n \n1  23.  During the same period, GEO and other private prison corporates have spent tens of \n2  millions of dollars on lobbying efforts.5   \n3  24.  As  immigration  detention  has  expanded,  private  prison  corporations,  particularly \n4  GEO, have gained an increasing share of the contracts for new detention beds.6  \n5  25.  Contracts with ICE accounted for 23.1% of GEO’s revenues in 2016, up from 17.7% \n6  in 2015.7 GEO officials expect these lucrative ICE contracts to account for a significant percentage \n7  of the corporation’s ongoing revenues.8  \n8  26.  GEO’s 2016 revenues were over $2 billion, and its stock is publicly traded on the \n9  New York Stock Exchange.   \n10  27.  GEO’s  economic  windfall,  and  the  profitability  of  its  immigration  detention \n11  enterprise, arises from its policy of systemically withholding necessary case from detainees to ensure a \n12  readily available, captive labor force that cleans, maintains, and operates its facilities for sub-minimal \n13  wages under threat of solitary confinement and abuse of legal process. Without this nearly free \n14  detainee labor, GEO’s windfall from immigrant detention would be substantially decreased. \n15  C.  GEO withholds necessary care from detainees at the Adelanto Facility.  \n16  28.  Since 2011, GEO has contracted with ICE to operate the Adelanto Facility, which is \n17  a 1,940-bed immigration detention facility in Adelanto, California. More than 73,000 detainees have \n18  passed through the Facility.   \n19  29.  The Adelanto Facility is notorious for its poor treatment of detainees. \n20  30.  For example, in November 2011, shortly after the Adelanto Facility opened, an ICE \n21  annual  review found  that the  facility’s  “medical  officials  were  not  conducting  detainee  health \n22 \n23 \n                                                                                                                                                            \n24  4 Jenny Jarvie, “This industry stands to benefit from Trump’s crackdown on the border,” Los Angeles Times (Feb. 14, \n2017) available at http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-immigrant-detention-20170214-story.html;  \n25  5 Michael Cohen, How for-proft prisons have become the biggest lobby no one is talking about, Washington Post (Apr. \n28, 2015), available at https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/04/28/how-for-profit-prisons-have-\nbecome-the-biggest-lobby-no-one-is-talking-about/?utm_term=.25de04ae71f9  \n26 \n6 Bethany Carson & Eleana Diaz, Payoff: How Congress Ensures Private Prison Profit with an Immigrant Detention \nQuota, Grassroots Leadership (Apr. 2015) at 4, Chart 1-AA, available at \n27 \nhttps://grassrootsleadership.org/sites/default/files/reports/quota_report_final_digital.pdf  \n7 The GEO Group, Inc., 2017 10-K form at 36, available at http://www.snl.com/Cache/c38242453.html.   \n28 \n8 Id. \n  5   \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514   Document 1   Filed 12/19/17   Page 6 of 18   Page ID #:6\n \n1  appraisals within 14 days of arrival, and registered nurses were performing health assessments” \n2  without proper training or certification.9 \n3  31.  Ten months later, ICE’s Office of Detention Oversight found that Adelanto Facility \n4  officials often delay responding to detainee requests for medical care and fail to promptly review \n5  medical records.10 That report also said that the death of a detainee in March 2012 resulted from \n6  “egregious errors” by medical staff and could have been prevented. \n7  32.  In 2014, the Office of Detention Oversight found the Adelanto Facility deficient in \n8  26 competency areas, including 16 related to the facility’s efforts to prevent and intervene in sexual \n9  abuse.11  \n10  33.  In 2015, more than two dozen members of Congress wrote a letter to the U.S. Justice \n11  Department and ICE officials expressing concerns about reports of medical neglect at the Facility.12 \n12  That same year, 26 detainees resorted to a two-week hunger strike to protest GEO’s failure to \n13  provide adequate care there.13    \n14  34.  The  Adelanto  Facility  was  called  “the deadliest  detention  center  of  2017”  by \n15  immigrant rights activists because more detainees died there than in any other detention center in the \n16  United States that year.14  \n17  35.  A peer-reviewed study released in 2017 found that detainees held six months or more \n18  in the Adelanto Facility experienced lower likelihoods of receiving any in-person visitation with their \n19  children as well as fewer total visits.15 \n20                                                   \n9 https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/odo-compliance-inspections/adelantoCorrectionalFac_Adelanto-CA-Sept_18-20-\n21 \n2012.pdf  \n10 Id.  \n22  11 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Office of Professional Responsibility, Office of Oversight Detention, \n“Compliance Inspection,” (July 2014), available at https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/odo-compliance-\n23  inspections/2014AdelantoJuly.pdf  \n12 Kate Linthicum, “Citing neglect, lawmakers urge halt to migrant detention center expansion,” Los Angeles Times (July \n24  14, 2015), available at  http://beta.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-adelanto-immigrant-detention-20150713-story.html  \n13 Kate Linthicum, “Immigrants end hunger strike at Adelanto detention facility,” Los Angeles Times (Nov. 16, 2015), \n25  available at http://beta.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-adelanto-hunger-strike-ends-20151116-story.html  \n14 Detention Watch Network, “Third Death in Immigration Detention Makes the Adelanto Detention Center the \nDeadliest Facility in 2017,” (June 2, 2017), available at \n26 \nhttps://www.detentionwatchnetwork.org/pressroom/releases/2017/third-death-immigration-detention-makes-adelanto-\ndetention-center-deadliest  \n27 \n15 Caitlin Patler and Nicolas Branic, “Patterns of Family Visitation During Immigration Detention,” RSF: The Russell \nSage Foundation Journal of the Social Sciences, vol. 3 no. 4 18-36 (July 2017) available at \n28 \nhttp://www.rsfjournal.org/doi/pdf/10.7758/RSF.2017.3.4.02  \n  6   \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514   Document 1   Filed 12/19/17   Page 7 of 18   Page ID #:7\n \n1  36.  Despite this track record, GEO maintains a corporate policy and uniform practice of \n2  withholding sufficient food, water, and hygiene products from the detainees at the Adelanto Facility. \n3  As  a  result,  detainees  are  forced  to  either  purchase  these  daily  necessities  from  the  Facility’s \n4  commissary, or go without.  \n5  37.  By maintaining these harsh conditions and purposely withholding basic necessities \n6  from detainees, GEO ensures an available labor pool of detainees will work for only $1 per day, thus \n7  allowing it to continue operating the Adelanto Facility at an enormous profit.  \n8  D.  GEO uses detainees to clean, maintain, and operate the Adelanto Facility. \n9  38.  Through its so-called Voluntary Work Program (the “Work Program”), GEO hires \n10  detainees to perform work that directly contributes to institutional operations, at a rate of $1 per \n11  day.16    \n12  39.  Despite its name, the Work Program is not “voluntary.” Instead, GEO maintains a \n13  corporate policy and uniform practice at the Adelanto Facility of withholding necessary care from its \n14  detainees. As a result, detainees are forced to submit to GEO’s $1 per day scheme in order to buy \n15  necessities – including food, water, and hygiene products – that GEO refuses to provide for them.   \n16  40.  Further, GEO maintains a corporate policy and uniform practice at the Facility of \n17  threatening to place those who refuse to work into solitary confinement. These conditions, policies, \n18  and practices ensure that detainees continue working for subminimum wages.       \n19  41.  In the Work Program, detainees are required to work according to an assigned work \n20  schedule and to participate in work-related training. At all times, GEO controls detainees’ wages, \n21  hours, and working conditions.   \n22  42.  GEO provides all necessary personal protection equipment and work uniforms. For \n23  example, kitchen workers are provided with and required to wear a white top/bottom uniform with a \n24  white apron, rubberized work boots, beard guards and hairnets, and freezer jackets and gloves as \n25  needed.  \n26 \n27 \n                                                 \n28 \n16 Id.  \n  7   \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514   Document 1   Filed 12/19/17   Page 8 of 18   Page ID #:8\n \n1  43.  GEO  records  the  hours  detainees  work  and  periodically  credits  wages  to  their \n2  accounts.         \n3  44.  The detainee workers are “employees,” and GEO is an “employer” under California’s \n4  minimum wage laws. \n5  45.  GEO informs all detainees entering the Adelanto Facility that the following work \n6  assignments may be available through the Work Program:  \n7  a.  Intake \n8  b.  Kitchen Worker \n9  c.  Recreation \n10  d.  Library \n11  e.  Barber \n12  f.  Laundry \n13  g.  Living area clean-up/janitorial \n14  h.  Evening workers (facility janitorial) \n15  i.  Maintenance \n16  46.  In the course of their labor and employment by GEO, detainees employed in the \n17  Work Program performed a wide range of work, including but not limited to: \n18  a.  Scrubbing bathrooms, showers, toilets, and windows; \n19  b.  Cleaning and maintaining GEO’s on-site medical facility;  \n20  c.  Cleaning patient rooms and medical staff offices; \n21  d.  Sweeping, mopping, stripping, and waxing floors throughout the facility; \n22  e.  Washing detainee laundry; \n23  f.  Preparing, cooking, and serving detainee meals; \n24  g.  Washing dishes; \n25  h.  Cleaning the kitchen and cafeteria before and after detainee meals; \n26  i.  Performing clerical work for GEO;  \n27  j.  Running and managing the law library; \n28  k.  Providing barber services to detainees; \n  8   \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514   Document 1   Filed 12/19/17   Page 9 of 18   Page ID #:9\n \n1  l.  Cleaning intake areas and solitary confinement units; and \n2  m. Cleaning and maintaining recreational areas. \n3  47.  The  Work  Program  allows  GEO  to  avoid  recruiting  from  the  traditional  labor \n4  market,  complying  with  the  terms  of  its  union  contracts,  and  paying  all  costs  associated  with \n5  potential, current, and former employment relationships, thereby reducing operational costs and \n6  increasing its own profits. \n7  48.  GEO does not pay and has not paid detainees the state minimum wage – currently, \n8  $10.50 per hour – for the hours they worked at the Adelanto Facility. \n9  49.  GEO’s contract with ICE requires GEO to comply with all federal, state, and local \n10  laws.  \n11  50.  No clause in GEO’s contract with ICE or any rule or standard incorporated by \n12  reference into the contract requires GEO to maximize its profits by paying detainees sub-minimum \n13  wages.  \n14  51.  GEO’s pay policies violate California’s minimum wage laws. \n15  E.  Plaintiff Novoa’s employment at the Adelanto Facility \n16  52.  Mr. Novoa is citizen of Mexico and a legal permanent resident of the United States. \n17  He has lived in Los Angeles since age four.   \n18  53.  Mr. Novoa is employed by a commercial construction company to complete roofing, \n19  tiling, drywalling, and framing projects. He currently earns $15.65 per hour.  \n20  54.  Mr. Novoa was detained at the Adelanto Facility from June 2012 through February \n21  2015. \n22  55.  Mr. Novoa has performed work for GEO at the Adelanto Facility and was not paid \n23  the state minimum wage for the work he has performed. \n24  56.  As a janitor, Mr. Novoa worked in a five-person crew to clean windows, floors, \n25  showers, bathrooms, and communal areas in the Facility. He worked four-hour shifts, up to seven \n26  days per week. He used cleaning supplies and equipment provided by GEO. \n27 \n28 \n  9   \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514   Document 1   Filed 12/19/17   Page 10 of 18   Page ID #:10\n \n1  57.  As a barber, Mr. Novoa provided haircutting services to other detainees. He worked \n2  up to 10 hours per day, seven days per week. He used barber supplies and equipment provided by \n3  GEO.  \n4  58.  In return for this labor, Mr. Novoa was paid $1 per day, regardless of the number of \n5  hours he worked. GEO credited these wages to Mr. Novoa’s commissary account.  \n6  59.  Mr. Novoa spent his wages on food, bottled water, and hygiene products from the \n7  Adelanto Facility commissary, among other necessities. \n8  60.  Officers  at  the  Adelanto  Facility  threatened  to  put  Mr.  Novoa  in  disciplinary \n9  segregation, i.e., solitary confinement, if Mr. Novoa stopped working or encouraged other detainees \n10  to stop working.   \n11  61.  If given a meaningful choice, Mr. Novoa would not have worked for $1 per day.  \n12  62.  GEO falsely led Mr. Novoa to believe the corporation could not pay him more than \n13  $1 per day, despite the fact that it does so as a matter of course at several of its other immigration \n14  detention facilities. \n15  63.  GEO retained the value of Mr. Novoa’s labor by realizing this value as corporate \n16  profits, rather than using it to provide for safer, more humane living conditions for detainees at the \n17  Adelanto Facility. \n18  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n19  64.  Plaintiff brings this lawsuit as a class action on behalf of himself, and all others \n20  similarly situated as members of the proposed classes, under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) \n21  and (b)(3). This action satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality, adequacy, predominance, and \n22  superiority requirements of those provisions.  \n23  A.  Class Definition \n24  65.  Plaintiff seeks to certify the following class: All civil immigration detainees who \n25  performed work for GEO at the Adelanto Detention Center in the Work Program since GEO \n26  assumed responsibility for the Facility in May 2011.  \n27 \n28 \n  10   \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514   Document 1   Filed 12/19/17   Page 11 of 18   Page ID #:11\n \n1  66.  Excluded  from  the  definition  are  the  defendants,  their  officers,  directors, \n2  management, employees, subsidiaries, and affiliates, and all federal governmental entities. Plaintiff \n3  reserves the right to revise the Class Definition based upon information learned through discovery. \n4  B.  Class Certification Requirements under Rule 23  \n5  67.  Numerosity:  Rule 23(a)(1). Each class is so numerous that joinder of all members \n6  is impracticable.  Plaintiff does not know the exact size of the class since that information is within \n7  the control of GEO. However, upon information and belief, Plaintiff alleges that the number of class \n8  members is numbered in the thousands. Membership in the class is readily ascertainable from GEO’s \n9  detention and employment records.   \n10  68.  Commonality  and  Predominance:    Rules  23(a)(2)  and  23(b)(3).  There  are \n11  numerous questions of law or fact common to the Class, and those issues predominate over any \n12  question affecting only individual class members. The common legal and factual issues include the \n13  following: \n14  a.  Whether Plaintiff and the Class Members were entitled to the protections of the \n15  California Minimum Wage Order;  \n16  b.  Whether Plaintiff and the Class Members performed compensable work;    \n17  c.  Whether Plaintiff and the Class Members were paid $1 per day for their labor; \n18  d.  Whether GEO engaged in conduct that violated California law – including the \n19  California Minimum Wage Order, the California Unfair Competition Law, and \n20  the California Trafficking Victims Protection Act; \n21  e.  Whether GEO engaged in conduct that violated the federal Trafficking Victims \n22  Protection Act; \n23  f.  Whether Plaintiff and the Class Members are entitled to equitable relief, including \n24  injunctive and declaratory relief; and  \n25  g.  Whether Plaintiff and the Class members are entitled to damages and other \n26  monetary relief and, if so, in what amount. \n27  69.  Typicality: Rule 23(a)(3).  The claims asserted by Plaintiff is typical of the claims of \n28  the Class, in that the representative plaintiff, like all Class Members, was paid subminimum wages \n  11   \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514   Document 1   Filed 12/19/17   Page 12 of 18   Page ID #:12\n \n1  while employed by GEO at the Adelanto Facility.  Each member of the proposed Class has been \n2  similarly injured financially by GEO’s misconduct. \n3  70.  Adequacy:  Rule 23(a)(4). Plaintiff will fairly and adequately protect the interests of \n4  the Class. Plaintiff has retained attorneys experienced in class and complex litigation, including wage \n5  and hour class action litigation. Plaintiff intends to vigorously prosecute this litigation. Neither \n6  Plaintiff nor his counsel have interests that conflict with the interests of the other class members.  \n7  71.  Superiority:  Rules 23(b)(3). Plaintiff and the Class Members have all suffered and \n8  will continue to suffer harm and damages as a result of GEO’s wrongful conduct. A class action is \n9  superior  to  other  available  methods  for  the  fair  and  efficient  adjudication  of  the  controversy. \n10  Treatment as a class action will permit a large number of similarly situated persons to adjudicate their \n11  common claims in a single forum simultaneously, efficiently, and without the duplication of effort \n12  and expense that numerous individual actions would engender. Class treatment will also permit the \n13  adjudication of claims by many members of the proposed class who could not individually afford to \n14  litigate a claim such as is asserted in this complaint. This class action likely presents no difficulties in \n15  management that would preclude maintenance as a class action.  \n16  CAUSES OF ACTION \n \n17  COUNT I \n  CALIFORNIA MINIMUM WAGE LAW \n18  Cal. Labor Code §§ 1194, 1197, 1197.1 \n19  72.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporate by reference herein all allegations above.  \n20  73.  The California Legislature set the following minimum wages for 2011-2017:17 \n21  January 1, 2017  $10.50 for employers with 26 employees or more \n22  January 1, 2014  $9.00 \n23  January 1, 2008  $8.00 \n24  74.  The minimum wage is an obligation of the employer and cannot be waived by any \n25  agreement.   \n26  75.  Detainees at the Adelanto Facility do not forfeit their rights to wage protections.  \n27 \n                                                 \n28 \n17 See http://www.dir.ca.gov/iwc/MinimumWageHistory.htm/; https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/faq_minimumwage.htm  \n  12   \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514   Document 1   Filed 12/19/17   Page 13 of 18   Page ID #:13\n \n1  76.  Employees protected by California’s minimum wage laws must be paid at least the set \n2  hourly minimum wage. \n3  77.  Detainees at the Adelanto Facility who participate in the Work Program qualify as \n4  employees of GEO under California law. \n5  78.  GEO qualifies as an employer under California law.    \n6  79.  Labor in the immigration detention context is not intended as a punitive measure.      \n7  80.  GEO does not compensate detainees the state minimum wage for the work they \n8  performed at the Adelanto Facility. Instead, GEO pays detainees $1 per day for work they perform at \n9  its facility.  \n81.  Plaintiffs seek to recover, on their own behalf and on behalf of all others similarly \n10 \nsituated, unpaid minimum wages and costs of this suit.   \n \n11 \nCOUNT II \n12  UNJUST ENRICHMENT \nCalifornia Common Law \n13   \n14  82.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference herein all allegations above. \n15  83.  GEO materially and significantly reduced its labor costs and expenses, and increased \n16  its profits, because Plaintiff and Class Members perform undercompensated labor. \n17  84.  Plaintiff  and  Class  Members  conferred  non-gratuitous  benefits  upon  GEO  by \n18  performing work for $1 per day, for which GEO would otherwise have had to pay at least the \n19  applicable minimum wage or more, thereby significantly and materially increasing GEO’s profits, \n20  unjustly enriching GEO at the expense of and detriment to Plaintiff and Class Members. \n21  85.  GEO’s  retention  of  any  benefit  collected  directly  and  indirectly  from  this \n22  uncompensated labor violated principles of justice, equity, and good conscience.  \n23  86.  As a direct and proximate result of GEO’s forced labor practices, Plaintiff and Class \n24  Members have suffered concrete harm and injury, including physical and emotional injury, monetary \n25  loss, and the unlawful violation of their rights.     \n26  87.  Plaintiff and Class Members are entitled to recover from GEO all amounts that GEO \n27  has wrongfully and improperly obtained, and GEO should be required to disgorge to Plaintiff and \n28 \n  13   \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514   Document 1   Filed 12/19/17   Page 14 of 18   Page ID #:14\n \n1  the Class Members the benefits it has unjustly obtained. Plaintiff and Class Members are also entitled \n2  to recover exemplary damages. C.R.S. § 13- 21-102. \n \n3  COUNT III \nCALIFORNIA UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW \n4  Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200, et seq. \n5  88.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference herein all allegations above. \n6  89.  California’s Unfair Competition Law (“UCL”) prohibits unfair competition, defined \n7  as “any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or \n8  misleading advertising and any act prohibited by [California’s False Advertising Law].”  Cal. Bus. & \n9  Prof. Code § 17200. \n10  90.  GEO willfully violated, and continues to violate, the “unlawful” prong of the UCL by \n11  violating California labor law. \n12  91.  The acts, omissions, and practices of GEO constitute unfair and unlawful business \n13  acts and practices under the UCL in that GEO’s conduct offends public policy against forced labor, \n14  and seeks to profit by violating Plaintiffs’ rights under state and federal law.  \n15  92.  As a direct and proximate result of GEO’s unlawful and unfair business practices, \n16  Plaintiff and the Class Members have suffered economic injury. \n \n17 \nCOUNT IV \nCALIFORNIA TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION ACT \n18 \nCal. Civ. Code § 52.5 \n19  93.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference herein all allegations above. \n20  94.  Pursuant to the California Trafficking Victims Protection Act, Cal. Civ. Code § 52.5, \n21  “a victim of human trafficking, as defined in Section 236.1 of the Penal Code, may bring a civil action \n22  for actual damages, compensatory damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief, any combination of \n23  those, or any other appropriate relief.”  \n24  95.  Human trafficking is defined as the deprivation or violation of the personal liberty of \n25  another “with the intent to obtain forced labor or services.” Cal. Penal Code § 236.1. \n26  96.  Forced  labor  or  services  is  defined  as  “labor  or  services  that  are  performed  or \n27  provided by a person and are obtained or maintained through force, fraud, duress, or coercion, or \n28 \n  14   \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514   Document 1   Filed 12/19/17   Page 15 of 18   Page ID #:15\n \n1  equivalent  conduct  that  would  reasonably  overbear  the  will  of  the  person.” Cal.  Penal  Code \n2  § 236.1(h)(5). \n3  97.  GEO materially and significantly reduced its labor costs and expenses, and increased \n4  its  profits,  by  unlawfully  forcing  and  coercing  Plaintiff  and  the  Class  Members  to  perform \n5  uncompensated labor. In order to drive profits, GEO acted with the intent to obtain forced labor or \n6  services from its detainees.  \n7  98.  As alleged herein, GEO did not and does not provide detainees at the Adelanto \n8  Facility with sufficient provisions and necessities for daily life. In order to purchase these necessary \n9  items, including bottled water and extra food, Plaintiff and the Class Members were forced or \n10  coerced to perform labor and services for GEO for $1 per day.  \n11  99.  Plaintiff and Class Members are entitled to recover from GEO all amounts that GEO \n12  has wrongfully and improperly obtained, and GEO should be required to disgorge to Plaintiff and \n13  the Class Members the benefits it has unjustly obtained. Plaintiff and Class Members are also entitled \n14  to recover exemplary damages. C.R.S. § 13- 21-102. \n \n15  COUNT V \n ATTEMPTED FORCED LABOR \n16 \n18 U.S.C. §§ 1589(a) & 1594(a) \n17 \n100.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference herein all allegations above. \n18 \n101.  Plaintiff and the Class Members are victims of attempted forced labor as defined by \n19 \n18 U.S.C. § 1589(a). \n20 \n102.  GEO attempts to violate 18 U.S.C. § 1589(a)(2) by knowingly maintaining a corporate \n21 \npolicy and uniform practice at the Adelanto Facility aimed at obtaining nearly free detainee labor and \n22 \nservices by:   \n23 \na.  Withholding  daily  necessities  from  Plaintiff  and  the  Class  Members,  thereby \n24 \nforcing  them  to  work  for  subminimum  wages  in  order  to  buy  those  daily \n25 \nnecessities for themselves and avoid serious harm, including, but not limited to, \n26 \nmalnutrition,  unsanitary  living  quarters,  extreme  isolation,  and  unhygienic \n27 \nconditions of confinement;  \n28 \n  15   \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514   Document 1   Filed 12/19/17   Page 16 of 18   Page ID #:16\n \n1  b.  Threatening Plaintiff and the Class Members with physical restraint, serious harm, \n2  and abuse of law or legal process if they refuse to provide their labor, organize a \n3  work stoppage, or participate in a work stoppage;  \n4  103.  GEO  further  violated  18  U.S.C.  §  1589  by  maintaining  a  corporate  policy  and \n5  uniform practice at the Adelanto Facility of threatening to put Plaintiff and the Class Members with \n6  serious harm, including solitary confinement, referral to an ICE officer, or criminal prosecution if \n7  they refused to work. \n8  104.  GEO attempted to perpetrate the offense of forced labor against Plaintiff and the \n9  Class Members.  \n10  105.  GEO knowingly benefitted financially from participation in a venture GEO knew or \n11  should have known engaged in unlawful coercion of labor in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1589. \n12  106.  Plaintiff  and  the  Class  Members  have  suffered  damages  in  an  amount  to  be \n13  determined at trial.  \n14  107.  Plaintiff and the Class Members are entitled to recover compensatory and punitive \n15  damages.  \n16  108.  Plaintiff and the Class Members are entitled to recover mandatory restitution in the \n17  full amount of their losses.  \n18  109.  Plaintiff and the Class Members are entitled to recover their reasonable attorney’s \n19  fees.  \n20  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n21  WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, individually and on behalf of the Class, requests that the Court:   \n22  a.  Certify this action as a class action, with a class as defined above;  \n23  b.  Find that Plaintiff is a proper representative of the Class, and appoint the undersigned as \n24  Class Counsel; \n25  c.  Order GEO to pay for notifying Class Members of the pendency of this suit;  \n26  d.  Order disgorgement of GEO’s unjustly-acquired revenue, profits, and other benefits \n27  resulting from its unlawful conduct; \n28 \n  16   \n \n \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514   Document 1   Filed 12/19/17   Page 17 of 18   Page ID #:17\n \n1  e.

Award injunctive relief as is necessary to protect the interests of Plaintiff and Class \n4  Members, including enjoining GEO from continuing to conduct business through the \n5  unlawful and unfair practices alleged herein; \n6  g.  Award Plaintiff and Class Members monetary damages for lost wages in an amount to be \n7  determined at trial;  \n8  h.

HUSP Class Members Face a Severe Risk of Contracting \n7 \nCOVID-19 as a Result of GEO’s HUSPs in Each Covered \n8  Facility. .......................................................................................................... 5 \n9  1.  GEO’s HUSP programs expose Class Members to \nthe COVID-19 virus on a daily basis. .......................................... 5 \n10 \n11  2.  Class Members are especially susceptible to \nimmediate and significant harm from contracting \n12 \nCOVID-19. ...................................................................................... 7 \n13 \n3.  GEO has failed to protect Class Members while \n14  requiring adherence to the HUSP Program. ............................ 11 \n15 \nIII.  ARGUMENT ...................................................................................................... 14 \n16 \nA.  The Court should grant injunctive relief to protect Class \n17  Members during the pendency of this action. ..................................... 15 \n18 \n1.  Movants are likely to succeed on the merits because \ncompelled participation in the HUSP program under \n19 \nthreat of serious illness or death, or violent reprisals \n20 \nfrom guards, violates the TVPA’s forced labor \nprohibition. .................................................................................... 15 \n21 \n22  2.  Class Members face immediate, irreparable harm \nbecause the HUSP program puts Class Members in a \n23 \nheightened risk of exposure to COVID-19, a serious, \n24  potentially life threatening incurable disease. ........................... 18 \n25  3.  The balance of the equities favors injunctive relief \nbecause life and health of Class Members outweighs \n26 \nGEO’s profits from slave labor. ................................................ 21 \ni  \nPLAINTIFFS’ EX PARTE MOTION FOR A   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \nTEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n \n   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 252-1   Filed 04/06/20   Page 3 of 32   Page ID\n #:5117\n4.

INTRODUCTION \n1 \n2 \nThis Court has certified a class under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) which includes any \n3 \nperson who is (a) civilly detained at any GEO immigration detention center in the United \n4 \nStates and (b) subject to a GEO Housing Unit Sanitation Policy (HUSP) at any point \n5 \nduring  their  detention  (collectively  the  “HUSP  Class,”  and  individually  “Class \n6  Members”).1 Dkt. 229 at 2.  \n7 \nAs those appointed to represent the HUSP Class with regard to how GEO “has \n8 \nacted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class,” Movants Raul \n9 \nNovoa, Jaime Campos Fuentes, Abdiaziz Karim, and Ramon Mancia request this Court \n10 \norder injunctive relief regarding Class Members’ exposure to Coronavirus Disease 2019 \n11 \n(“COVID-19”) requiring GEO to either (a) halt the use of Class Members in the \n12 \nprovision of work or services under the HUSP program or (b) protect those detainees \n13 \nwho provide HUSP services by (i) providing protective clothing and antiseptic supplies \n14 \nand (ii) conducting testing of all Class Members to detect COVID-19. Given the ongoing \n15 \nHUSP program, the prevalence of COVID-19 in GEO facilities, and the dire and \n16 \nimmediate threat of death or serious illness resulting from exposure to COVID-19, the \n17 \nClass Members need immediate help.  \n18 \nII.  FACTS SUPPORTING EMERGENCY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n19 \n20  COVID-19 has found its way into GEO detention facilities. The living conditions \n21  encourage the rapid transmission of the virus and exposure to COVID-19 throughout \n22  the GEO facilities. And yet, GEO’s HUSPs still force Class Members to clean the \n23   \n1 The HUSP Class excludes (1) individuals detained in GEO’s family residential detention facility in \n24 \nKarnes  City,  Texas;  (2)  individuals  detained  in  the  Alexandria  Staging  Facility  in  Alexandria, \nLouisiana;  (3)  any  individual  detained  in  the  custody  of  the  U.S.  Marshall  or  any  other  law \n25 \nenforcement agency at a GEO facility where the company also detains civil immigration detainees \npursuant to contracts with ICE; and (4) civilly detained immigrants detainees held at the Aurora ICE \n26 \nProcessing Center in Aurora, Colorado at any time before October 22, 2014.  \n1  \nPLAINTIFFS’ EX PARTE MOTION FOR A   5:17-cv-02514-JGB  \nTEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n \n   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 252-1   Filed 04/06/20   Page 8 of 32   Page ID\n #:5122\n1  epicenter of COVID-19’s spread at its facilities—the common spaces. GEO provides \n2  no protection to these workers, so they are unnecessarily exposed to COVID-19 because \n3  of GEO’s HUSP program. The circumstances call for immediate action to protect the \n4  Class Members where their ward, GEO, has completely failed.  \n5 \nA.  The Coronavirus Global Pandemic and the National Emergency  \n6 \nCOVID-19 is a disease caused by a coronavirus that has reached pandemic status. \n7 \nIt spreads easily from person to person.2 This Court has recognized the ease by which \n8 \nCOVID-19 is spread: \n9 \nAccording  to  the  United  States  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and \n10  Prevention, the coronavirus is spread mainly through person-to-person \ncontact. More specifically, the coronavirus is spread between people who \n11 \nare  in  close  contact—within  about  6  feet  with  one  another  through \n12  respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. \nThe droplets can land in the mouths or noses, or can be inhaled into the \n13 \nlungs, of people who are within about 6 feet of the infected person. \n14  Moreover, studies have established that the coronavirus can survive up to \nthree days on various surfaces.3 \n15 \n16  As  of  April  5,  2020,  304,826  people  in  the  United  States  have  confirmed \n17  diagnoses,  and  7,616  Americans  have  died  after  contracting  COVID-19.4  These \n18  numbers are expected to grow exponentially.

The HUSP Class face a severe risk of contracting COVID-19 as a result of \n1 \nGEO’s HUSPs in each covered facility.  \n2 \nThe  COVID-19  pandemic  has  also  cast  GEO’s  treatment  of  HUSP  Class \n3 \nmember in a new and dire light.  \n4 \n1.  GEO’s HUSP programs expose Class Members to the COVID-19 \n5 \nvirus on a daily basis.  \n6 \nThe HUSPs at each GEO facility require detained immigrants to perform a wide \n7 \nrange of services that needlessly expose them to the spread of COVID-19. For example, \n8 \nAdelanto’s HUSP requires that “each and every detainee must participate in the facility’s \n9 \nsanitation program,” which includes cleaning “all commonly accessible areas of the \n10 \nunit.”16 The housing unit officer develops a list of detainees each day to assign to housing \n11 \nunit sanitation, though “[d]uring a general cleanup all detainees must participate.”17 In \n12 \naddition, “[a]ll detainees must participate” in a mandatory, general cleanup of their \n13 \nhousing units every day.18 The policies apply to all detained immigrants at Adelanto.19 \n14 \nMoreover, GEO’s Housekeeping Plan provides that “[o]n a weekly basis or as needed, \n15 \nall Housing Units will be subject to a total sanitation mission to assure standards are met \n16 \nand maintained.”20 This “total sanitation mission” is carried out by detained immigrants \n17 \npursuant to the HUSP.21 GEO’s HUSP program exposes Class Members to un-sanitized \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n \n22 \n16 Dkt. 193 (Wright Decl.) at Ex. 24 (“Policy 10.3.5”) at 3, 4 (emphasis added). \n23  17 Id. \n24  18 Wright Decl.

Class Members are especially susceptible to immediate and \nsignificant harm from contracting COVID-19.  \n8 \n9  Class Members at GEO’s detention facilities are highly likely to contract COVID-\n10  19 and suffer severe health effects as a result of the HUSPs.  \n11  COVID-19 is a disease that spreads easily “[b]etween people who are in close \n12  contact with one another (within about 6 feet),” and does so “[t]hrough respiratory \n13  droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.”31 Not surprisingly, the \n14  CDC has concluded immigration detention centers—such as those in which GEO \n15  enforces the HUSP program—are particularly susceptible to the spread and contraction \n16  of COVID-19 because they are congregate environments, i.e., places where people live \n17 \n18 \n \n19  Albence, the Adelanto Facility is “representative of all our detention centers.

Indeed, \n6  similar COVID-19 spread has happened to the Class Members at GEO’s Pine Prairie \n7  ICE Processing Center in Pine Prairie, Louisiana.

Rather than simply live in close quarters \n3  (which presents a risk in and of itself), Class Members must clean these common \n4  areas day after day without protection from COVID-19 . By design, GEO requires \n5  Class Members to enter and clean common areas by coercion and, thereby, \n6  risks—nearly guarantees—exposure to COVID-19. As this Court recently noted, \n7  “[t]he Government, here, cannot say, with any degree of certainty, that no one—staff or \n8  detainee—at Adelanto has not been, or will not be, infected with the coronavirus.”49  \n9  3.  GEO has failed to protect Class Members while requiring \nadherence to the HUSP Program.  \n10 \n11  Class Members cannot rely on GEO to protect them from the risk of contracting \n12  COVID-19 through participation in the HUSP program because GEO regularly fails to \n13  provide detainees basic personal hygiene items—even in this time of unprecedented \n14  crisis. For instance, at the LaSalle Detention Facility, Class Member Griselda del Bosque \n15  reports that “[v]ery little has changed in the facility to address the virus.”50 And Ms. Del \n16  Bosque confirms that “[t]he prisoners are the ones who do the cleanings in the dorms” \n17  but that the conditions fall well short of CDC guidelines for COVID-19 because Class \n18  Members “clean what [they] can with what they [i.e., GEO] give us, [but] usually [they] \n19  just have to use soap and water” or “one towel . . . to clean everything.”51 Even after the \n20  advent of COVID-19, GEO has failed to provide sufficient cleaning materials: “We \n21  sometimes don’t have soap or toilet paper for days if it’s not replaced.

We don’t have any sinks \n5 \nto clean our bowls, so people clean their bowls in the bathrooms. I \n6  work cleaning the showers in my dorm for one dollar a day. I am \nnot given any masks.

For example, following an unannounced inspection at one of \n3  GEO’s detention facilities, OIG issued a report on September 27, 2018 identifying “a \n4  number of serious issues that violate ICE’s 2011 [PBNDS] and pose significant health \n5  and safety risks at the facility.”60 The report concluded that detainees do not have timely \n6  access to proper medical care.61 The OIG described wait times for “acute illnesses,” \n7  which  would  include  illnesses  like  COVID-19,  as  “excessively  long.”  Thus  it  is \n8  reasonable to expect COVID-19 will also readily spread in detention centers, especially \n9  when people cannot engage in proper hygiene and isolate themselves from infected \n10  residents or staff.62 \n11  III.  ARGUMENT \n12 \nMovants herein seek limited, temporary relief to protect the health and safety of \n13 \nthe Class Members. The relief they seek will also protect the health and safety of GEO \n14 \npersonnel and healthcare workers at GEO’s detention facilities as well and the healthcare \n15 \ninfrastructure and communities where these facilities are located. Specifically, Movants \n16 \nseek an order requiring GEO to either (a) halt the use of Class Members in the provision \n17 \nof work or services under the HUSP program; or (b) protect those detainees who \n18 \nprovide HUSP services by (i) providing protective clothing and antiseptic supplies and \n19 \n(ii) conducting testing of all Class Members to detect COVID-19.  \n20 \n21 \n22   \n60 Wright Decl.

The Court should grant injunctive relief to protect Class Members \n1 \nduring the pendency of this action.  \n2 \nThe purpose of a TRO is to preserve the status quo and prevent irreparable harm \n3 \nbefore a preliminary injunction hearing is held.63 On a motion for a temporary restraining \n4 \norder, the Movant “must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is \n5 \nlikely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of \n6 \nequities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.”64 A temporary \n7 \nrestraining order may issue where “serious questions going to the merits [are] raised and \n8 \nthe balance of hardships tips sharply in [plaintiff’s] favor.”65 To succeed under the \n9 \n“serious question” test, Movants must show that they are likely to suffer irreparable \n10 \ninjury and that an injunction is in the public’s interest.66  \n11 \n1.  Movants are likely to succeed on the merits because compelled \n12 \nparticipation in the HUSP program under threat of serious illness \n13  or death, or violent reprisals from guards, violates the TVPA’s \nforced labor prohibition. \n14 \n15 \nTo  establish  a  claim  of  forced  labor  under  the  federal  Trafficking  Victims \n16 \nProtection Act (TVPA), Movants must show that GEO “knowingly provide[d] or \n17 \nobtain[ed]” their labor “by means of any scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause the \n18 \nperson to believe that, if that person did not perform such labor or services, that person \n19 \nor another person would suffer serious harm or physical restraint.”67 Serious harm is \n20 \n \n21 \n63 Granny Goose Foods, 415 U.S. 423, 439 (1974); see also Reno Air Racing Ass’n v.

GEO forces the HUSP \n12  Class to perform uncompensated janitorial and maintenance work in common areas of \n13  its  detention  facilities.71  GEO  obtains  this  free  labor  by  threatening  HUSP  Class \n14 \n15 \n16   \n68 18 U.S.C. § 1589 (c) (emphasis added).

Again, nothing in the text of the statute excludes federal \n10  contractors providing immigration detention services from liability under \nthe TVPA, even when that liability might arise out of the operation of a \n11 \nfederally mandated work program. And nothing in the PBNDS permits \n12  CoreCivic, or other private contractors operating immigration detention \nfacilities,  to  force  detainees  to  perform  labor  (beyond  personal \n13 \nhousekeeping tasks), and certainly not through the illegal coercive means \n14  explicitly listed in the TVPA.73 \n15 \nThe “personal housekeeping tasks” referred to in Barrientos expressly exclude the \n16 \ntasks required under GEO’s HUSP program: the point of the HUSP-related claim is that \n17 \nGEO demands Class Members to work and perform janitorial services in common areas \n18 \nnot included within the “personal housekeeping tasks” condoned by ICE through \n19 \nSection 5.8.V.C of the PBNDS.

GEO thus violates the TVPA every day in \n2  each of the covered facilities as a fundamental business practice.74 \n3  Plaintiffs are likely to prevail on the merits of their claim that GEO violates the \n4  TVPA, so this factor weighs in favor of the Court granting a temporary restraining order.  \n5  2.  Class Members face immediate, irreparable harm because the \nHUSP program puts Class Members in a heightened risk of \n6 \nexposure to COVID-19, a serious, potentially life threatening \n7  incurable disease. \n8 \nTo show irreparable harm a plaintiff “demonstrate immediate threatened injury \n9 \nas a prerequisite to preliminary injunctive relief.”75 “Irreparable harm is the single most \n10 \nimportant prerequisite for the issuance of a preliminary injunction.”76 This case presents \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n \n15 \n74 And such threats, as documented in the above-cited declarations and evidence, also violate the \ndetainees’ constitutional rights given the threat to their health and safety.  \n16 \nWhen the Government detains a person for the violation of an immigration law, the \n17 \nperson is a civil detainee, even if he has a prior criminal conviction. . . . Moreover, \nunder the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause, a civil detainee cannot be subjected \n18 \nto conditions that amount to punishment. . . . Moreover, the Government may not \n19  ignore a condition of confinement that is sure or very likely to cause serious illness. A \ncivil detainee’s constitutional rights are violated if a condition of his confinement \n20  places him at substantial risk of suffering serious harm, such as the harm caused by a \npandemic. . . .

Simply put, Class \n5  Members risk illness and death from participation in the HUSP. The argument is \n6  as stark as that. By requiring Class Members to participate in the HUSPs at all, let alone \n7  without personal protective equipment, GEO exposes Class Members to potential \n8  death and serious illness on a daily basis. COVID-19 exists in GEO’s facilities.78 \n9  And cleaning those facilities, in particular the common areas where detainees gather and \n10  interact, without protective equipment nearly guarantees exposure to COVID-19.  \n11  The  CDC  has  advised  that,  when  disinfecting  common  areas,  cleaning  staff \n12  should “wear disposable gloves and gowns for all tasks in the cleaning process.”79 The \n13  CDC also recommends that cleaning staff wash their hands often using soap or, if soap \n14   \n77 See Harris v.

People live in close quarters and cannot achieve the “social distancing” \n5  needed to effectively prevent the spread of COVID-19. The inability to maintain the \n6  recommended distance of 6 feet from others, and the sharing and touching of objects \n7  used by others is particularly true with HUSP Class Members who GEO forces to clean \n8  common areas by threatening them with solitary confinement, a loss of privileges, and \n9  criminal prosecution if they do not fulfill their cleaning assignments. \n10  Given  the  combination  of  the  close  quarters  in  which  Class  Members  are \n11  confined, and their forced exposure to GEO’s employees and new detainees, conditions \n12  faced by Class Members pose a significant risk of imminent and irreparable harm absent \n13  the requested injunctive relief.85 \n14  3.  The balance of the equities favors injunctive relief because life and \nhealth of Class Members outweighs GEO’s profits from illegal, \n15 \nunpaid, forced labor. \n16 \nIn considering an order of injunctive relief, “[a] court must balance the competing \n17 \nclaims of injury and must consider the effect on each party of the granting or withholding \n18 \nof the requested relief.”86 The question is not even close. Class Members face the risk of \n19 \nserious illness or death from COVID-19. By contrast, GEO faces the risk of hiring and \n20 \nequipping cleaning staff instead of lining its pockets with profits won from slave labor. \n21 \n22 \n \n23 \n85 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 \n24  (COVID-19)  in  Correctional  and  Detention  Facilities  (updated  Mar.  23,  2020),  available  at \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-\n25  correctional-detention.html (last accessed Apr. 3, 2020). \n86 Arc of Cal. v.

When faced with a conflict between financial \n4  concerns and preventable human suffering, courts in this Circuit have had little difficulty \n5  concluding that “the balance of the hardships tips decidedly in plaintiffs’ favor.” 87 To \n6  ask the question answers it: GEO’s profits from slave labor cannot outweigh the health \n7  of Class Members.  \n8  4.  Injunctive relief is in the public interest because the requested \nrelief helps sever the chain of exposure to COVID-19. \n9 \n10  With respect to the final element, the requested injunction would serve the public \n11  interest because “[p]rotecting public health and safety is clearly in the public interest.”88 \n12  Movants seek injunctive relief to prevent the spread of a pandemic. While the HUSP \n13  Class Members seek the relief for their own protection, the relief they request will benefit \n14  everyone who lives or works in GEO’s facilities.

Picayune Rancheria of Chukchansi Indians of Cal., No. 1:14-CV-01593 (LJO-SAB), 2015 \n22  WL 9304835, at *8 (E.D. Cal. Dec. 22, 2015), aff’d sub nom. California v.

And this cycle will \n2  continue without Court intervention. Exempting the Class Members from the HUSP, \n3  or providing them with adequate protection, would eliminate that link and, in turn, slow \n4  the spread of COVID-19. This factor supports injunctive relief. \n5 \nB.  The Court should grant the relief without requiring a bond. \n6 \nWhile Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c) generally requires security be posted \n7 \nbefore a temporary restraining is entered, this Court has the discretion to decide whether, \n8 \nor in what amount, a bond is required.89 \n9 \nDistrict courts routinely exercise this discretion to require no security in cases \n10 \nbrought by indigent and/or incarcerated people. 90 So too here, Movants ask that this \n11 \nCourt exercise its discretion and grant the requested temporary restraining order without \n12 \nrequiring payment of security; or in the alternative, a minimal bond. \n13 \n14  IV.  CONCLUSION \n15 \nFor  the  foregoing  reasons,  Movants  request  this  Court  grant  a  temporary \n16 \nrestraining  order  in  the  form  submitted  and  set  this  matter  for  determination  of \n17 \nextending its ruling in the form of a preliminary injunction. \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n \n25  89 Jorgensen v.

Based on that review, the Court finds \n4  that immediate injunctive relief in the form of a temporary restraining order should be \n5  issued. In particular, the Court finds as follows: \n6  1.  COVID-19 is a disease that has reached pandemic status. It spreads easily \n7  from person to person. The Court adopts and incorporates its discussion of the threat \n8  posed by COVID-19 as set forth in Hernandez v. Wolf, No. 5:20-cv-00617-TJH (KS) \n9  (C.D. Cal. Apr. 1, 2020). Based on the facts in that record (of which the Court takes \n10  judicial notice) and the facts set forth in the record here by Plaintiffs’ the Court finds \n11  that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that Plaintiffs face \n12  imminent and irreparable harm from participating in the Housing Unit Sanitation Policy \n13  (“HUSP”) program without sufficient protective safeguards and equipment in light of \n14  the exceptional risks posed by COVID-19. \n15  2.  Plaintiffs are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of the issuance \n16  of a temporary restraining order. Plaintiffs are Class Members1 who provide janitorial \n17  and other work services at Defendant’s detention facilities. By participating in the \n18  HUSPs, Class Members risk illness and death since they perform those services without \n19  personal protective equipment or sufficient disinfectant and sanitary supplies. Being \n20 \n21 \n \n22  1 Class Members include any person who is (a) civilly detained at any GEO immigration detention \ncenter in the United States and (b) subject to a GEO Housing Unit Sanitation Policy (HUSP) at any \n23  point during their detention excluding (1) individuals detained in GEO’s family residential detention \nfacility in Karnes City, Texas; (2) individuals detained in the Alexandria Staging Facility in Alexandria, \n24 \nLouisiana;  (3)  any  individual  detained  in  the  custody  of  the  U.S.  Marshall  or  any  other  law \nenforcement agency at a GEO facility where the company also detains civil immigration detainees \n25 \npursuant to contracts with ICE; and (4) civilly detained immigrants detainees held at the Aurora ICE \n26  Processing Center in Aurora, Colorado at any time before October 22, 2014. Dkt. No. 229 at 2. \n1  \nPROPOSED] ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFFS’   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \nEX PARTE APPLICATION FOR TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER \n \n`   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 252-2   Filed 04/06/20   Page 3 of 4   Page ID\n #:5149\n1  required to clean those facilities, in particular the common areas where detainees gather \n2  and interact, nearly guarantees exposure to COVID-19. \n3  And the potential threat of contracting COVID-19 constitutes irreparable harm. \n4  Class Members include older adults and people with underlying medical conditions that \n5  increase their likelihood of severe illness or death if they contract COVID-19. Those \n6  patients  in  high-risk  categories  who  do  not  die  from  COVID-19  should  expect  a \n7  prolonged recovery, including the need for extensive rehabilitation. For these reasons, \n8  public  health  experts  have  concluded  that  people  with  these  characteristics  in \n9  institutional settings such as immigration detention centers are at grave risk of severe \n10  illness and death. \n11  The risk of irreparable harm likewise exists for those Class Members who do not \n12  possess underlying conditions which make them especially vulnerable to COVID-19. \n13  According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 creates \n14  serious illness in 16% of all cases, and 38% of those hospitalized for COVID-19 have \n15  been people between 20–54 years old. \n16  3.  The balance of equities also favors injunctive relief. Class Members face \n17  the risk of serious illness or death from COVID-19. By contrast, if GEO must find other \n18  workers, or provide additional supplies and PPE to the Class Members who participate \n19  in the HUSP, it will suffer only a monetary impact in terms of higher costs. A balancing \n20  of the health and welfare, including potential death, of Class Members against increased \n21  expenditures for GEO results in a finding that supports injunctive relief. \n22  4.  Finally, injunctive relief is in the public interest. Protecting public health \n23  and safety is clearly in the public interest. Movants seek injunctive relief to prevent the \n24  spread of a pandemic. The relief requested will benefit everyone who lives or works in \n25  GEO’s facilities. This factor supports injunctive relief. \n26 \n2  \nPROPOSED] ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFFS’   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \nEX PARTE APPLICATION FOR TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER \n \n`   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 252-2   Filed 04/06/20   Page 4 of 4   Page ID\n #:5150\n1  Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiff’s Motion for Temporary Restraining \n2  Order should be, and hereby is GRANTED. The Court hereby ORDERS THAT: \n3   \n4  ____  Defendant GEO shall immediately halt the use of any in the provision of \n5  work or services under the HUSP. \n6    or \n7   ____ Defendant GEO shall equip those Class Members who provide HUSP \n8  services with protective clothing and antiseptic supplies in accordance with \n9  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention,  Interim  Guidance  on \n10  Management  of  Coronavirus  Disease  2019  (COVID-19)  in  Correctional  and \n11  Detention Facilities, and conduct weekly testing of all Class Members who \n12  participate in the HUSP to detect and protect against the threat of death \n13  or serious illness from COCIV-19. \n14   \n15    The Court finds that this order should issue without the need for Plaintiffs to post \n16  any security or bond. The Court also finds issuance of this order on an ex parte basis is \n17  justified  based  on  the  representation  by  Plaintiffs  that  they  informed  counsel  for \n18  Defendants of the substance of their Application for a temporary restraining order \n19  requiring COVID-19 prevention measures for Cationwide HUSP class by email on \n20  March 18, 2020 and by phone on April 6, 2020 but counsel for defendants could not \n21  state whether they oppose the filing of the Application. \n22   \n23  Issued at ___ am/pm, this ___ day of April, 2020. \n24   \n25  UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n \n26 \n3  \nPROPOSED] ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFFS’   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \nEX PARTE APPLICATION FOR TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER \n \n`   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 252-3   Filed 04/06/20   Page 1 of 3   Page ID\n #:5151\n \n1 \n \n2   \n \n3 \n \n4   \n \n5 \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \n6  CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nEASTERN DIVISION \n7 \n \n8  RAUL NOVOA, JAIME CAMPOS   \nFUENTES, ABDIAZIZ KARIM, and  Civil Action No. 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-\n9 \nRAMON MANCIA individually and on  SHKx \n10  behalf of all others similarly situated,   \n                                Plaintiffs,  [PROPOSED] ORDER TO SHOW \n11    CAUSE \nv. \n12 \n \n13  THE GEO GROUP, INC., \n                                Defendant. \n14 \n \n15   \n \n16 \n \n \n17 \n \n18 \n \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n   \n[PROPOSED] ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE    5:17-cv-02514-JGB \n \n`   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 252-3   Filed 04/06/20   Page 2 of 3   Page ID\n #:5152\n1  Upon  review  of  Plaintiffs’  Motion  for  Temporary  Restraining  Order  and \n2  Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support Thereof, all supporting exhibits and \n3  declarations and any response filed by Defendants the Court HEREBY ORDERS: \n4  1.

My name is Griselda Del Bosque. I am 57 years old and a Mexican citizen.  I am \ncurrently detained at LaSalle ICE Processing Center in Jena, Louisiana.  \n \n2. I am an asthmatic. The inhaler I was given in this facility controls the asthma a little but \nnot all the way. I wake up every morning unable to breath, the vapor and humidity in the \nprison affect my lungs a lot and I’ve had a cough since I got here three months ago. \nWhen I walk, laugh, sit, I get asthma attacks.  \n \n3. I have many other health issues including glaucoma in my eyes; I was told a year ago that \nif I didn’t get treatment I could go blind. I can’t feel one of my arms, have disk issues in \nmy back and knee problems that make it hard to walk. I only get treatment for my asthma \nand Tylenol for the pain in my body. \n \n4. I’ve been able to see the doctor twice, the last time was on March 24th because I haven’t \n​\n​\nbeen feeling well. They told me my heart was racing and said maybe it was because of \nstress but didn’t give me any other information.  \n \n5. Very little has changed in the facility to address the virus. Some of the guards walk \naround with masks, not all, and I haven’t seen any of them wear gloves, not even the \nmedical staff. A guard told us that with or without the virus they will keep picking people \nup, having court, and deporting people. A nurse said to us she didn’t understand why they \nkept bringing people here, and that we’re all being put at risk by bringing new people all \nthe time. \n \n6. The only instruction we’ve received about the virus is to wash our hands and stay at a \ndistance, which made us mad because how can we do that with how close the beds \nare—less than a foot in between. We tried putting towels between the beds to make a \nbarrier but the guards forced us to take them down.  \n \n7. We still sometimes don’t have soap or toilet paper for several days if it’s not replaced. \nWe were told by a guard that the soap we are given in the bathrooms is for hands and \nbody only but that it’s not disinfecting.  \n \n8. I am confined to dorm Alpha D, with 80 other women. It is one big room where we all \nsleep, eat, and bathe, and we all share three bathrooms, six showers, and eight or nine \nphones. One month ago the water got turned off and we couldn’t clean anything for days. \nThe prisoners are the ones who do the cleanings in the dorms, there are some who are \npaid to do it $1 a day, but we also volunteer to help. We clean what we can with what \nthey give us, usually we just have to use soap and water. Yesterday they brought us this \nliquid to clean the tables. With one towel we’re supposed to clean everything, the phone, \nthe tables, the bathrooms.  \n\nCase 5:17-cCva-0s2e5 21:42-0J-GcvB--0S1H09K3     D Dooccuummeennt t2 25-38- 1   F  iFleilde d0 40/40/10/62/02 0   P  aPgaeg e2  3o fo 2f 3   Page ID\n #:5161\n \n9. There are some very sick women here. There was one who couldn’t breathe, another who \nhas cancer and was passing out because of the pain. Two women in another dorm were \nremoved and put into the solitary confinement cells because they had a cough and fever. I \ndon’t know what has happened to those two women. Six or seven new women arrived \nThursday night, and they’re being put in with everyone else.  \n \n10.If I was released I would stay with my daughter Cristal Del Bosque, at 507 Fairview \nRoad, Dallas, TX 75223. \n \n11. I have authorized my attorney to sign on my behalf, given the difficulty of arranging \nvisitation and travel in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic. If required to do so, I \nwill provide a signature when I am able to do so. \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing information is true and correct to the best of \nmy knowledge. \n_________________________________________________ Date: 03/27/2020 \nJeremy Jong signing on behalf of Griselda Del Bosque \n \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 253-2   Filed 04/06/20   Page 1 of 3   Page ID\n #:5162\n \n \n \n \nEXHIBIT B \n\nCase 5:17-Ccva-s0e2 521:240-J-cGvB-0-1S0H9K3      DDooccuummeenntt  225-139-2     F Filieledd 0 044/0/016/2/200     P Paaggee 1 2 o of f2 3   Page ID\n #:5163\nDeclaration of Sonia Lemus Tejada Dejaso \n \nI, Sonia Lemus Tejada Dejaso, declare as follows: \n \n1. My name is Sonia Lemus Tejada Dejaso. I am 53 years old and a Guatemalan citizen.  I \nam currently detained at LaSalle ICE Processing Center in Jena, Louisiana.  \n \n2. If I were released I would live with my son Miguel Angel Sanchez at 15812 Orange Dr., \nEdinburg, TX, 78541. \n \n3. I have a history of heart issues. In the decades I lived in Texas before my detention, I \noften had to go to the hospital for various heart problems. \n \n4. I currently suffer from hypertension and take medications daily in an attempt to control \nmy blood pressure.  \n \n5. Because of my heart and blood pressure issues, I have major problems sleeping. I \nregularly have pain in my head and my chest. When I go to the medical unit, they only \ngive me Tylenol for pain.  \n \n6. About four or five weeks ago, I was taken to the emergency room at Lasalle General \nHospital when I wasn’t able to breathe and started feeling numbness in parts of my body. \nThe doctors at the hospital never told me what was wrong with me. I still have residual \npain in the left side of my back since that day. \n \n7. At LaSalle, I am housed in Falcon-D dorm. The dorm has enough beds for 80 people and \nwe have been at capacity for a long time. People are transferred in and out all the time. In \nthe past two weeks, ICE has brought in about 15 new detainees to the dorm as other \npeople have left. \n \n8. We’ve been at capacity for a long time and still people are transferred in all the time. In \nthe past two weeks, ICE has brought in about 15 new detainees to the dorm as people \nhave left. \n \n9. Conditions in our dorm are unsanitary. We don’t have any sinks to clean our bowls, so \npeople clean their bowls in the bathrooms. I work cleaning the showers in my dorm for \none dollar a day. I am not given any masks. Sometimes I run out of cleaning supplies and \nhave to wash the floor of the showers with shampoo. The showers are only cleaned twice \na day. \n \n10.Three days ago, LaSalle staff came to talk to us about coronavirus. We had questions for \nthem, such as asking what they were doing to ensure that staff stayed away from us so \nthat they would not give us coronavirus. But staff were very dismissive of us and shushed \nour questions. \n \n\nCase 5:17-Ccva-s0e2 521:240-J-cGvB-0-1S0H9K3      DDooccuummeenntt  225-139-2     F Filieledd 0 044/0/016/2/200     P Paaggee 2 3 o of f2 3   Page ID\n #:5164\n11.After they left, the officials went to the next dorm over to do the same presentation. \nShortly afterwards, I was looking out the window of the dorm when I saw detained \npeople coming out of that dorm, Falcon-C, choking and gasping for air.  When people \nwere leaving the dorm choking, I saw one of the guards choking as well.  \n \n12.Then, gas from the other dorm started seeping into our dorm. Our eyes started burning. \nSome of us that were closer to the door also started choking and crying.  Our throats have \nbeen hurting. Some fell to the floor and vomited. I still have pain in my throat.There is no \nhumanity for us here.  \n \n13.I have authorized my attorney to sign on my behalf, given the difficulty of arranging \nvisitation and travel in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic.

My name is Mariel Villarreal. I am an immigration attorney at non-profit organization \n4 \nPangea Legal Services, located at 350 Sansome St. Suite 650, San Francisco, CA 94104. \n5 \nAll times in this declaration will be in Pacific Standard Time, unless specified otherwise, \n6 \nas that is the time zone in which I work. \n7 \n2.  Our office represents Jennifer Isabel Avalos Barrios (“Ms. Avalos Barrios”) in her \n8 \nimmigration proceedings. I am currently representing Ms. Avalos Barrios in her \n9 \nproceedings before the LaSalle Immigration Court. \n10 \n3.  Ms. Avalos Barrios is a 24-year-old Guatemalan national who has been detained by \n11 \nRespondents at the LaSalle Detention Facility since approximately December 11, 2019. \n12 \n4.  On March 25, 2020, I had a video teleconference (“VTC”) meeting scheduled with Ms. \n13 \nAvalos Barrios via Skype at 9:00am PST (11:00am CT). I did not receive a call at the \n14 \nscheduled time.  \n15 \n5.  At 9:32am, I emailed the facility’s visitation request email address as well as Ms. Susan \n16 \nMorris at Geo Group—with whom I have corresponded to set up VTC calls with Ms. \n17 \nAvalos Barrios in the past—stating that I had not been called for my meeting. \n18 \n6.  At 9:42am, I received a text message from Ms. Avalos Barrios’s sister, Nereyda Avalos \n19 \nBarrios, stating that her sister, Ms. Avalos Barrios, had called her extremely distraught \n20 \nsaying that officials in the detention center were letting out tear gas and that people were \n21 \nfainting. In a second text message, Ms. Avalos Barrios’s sister told me that Ms. Avalos \n22 \nBarrios said everyone was coughing and screaming. \n23 \n7.  At 10:05am, I called the Geo Group – Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) \n24 \nProcessing Center in Jena, Louisiana. I left a voicemail message to which I did not receive \n25 \na call back. \n26 \n8.  At 10:08am, I emailed Ms. Morris and the visitation request email address again, stating \n27  that I heard tear gas was used on individuals in the detention center and that I was \n28 \n  1 \n  \n\nCase 5:17-Ccva-s0e2 521:240-J-cGvB-0-1S0H9K3      DDooccuummeenntt  225-332-4     F Filieledd 0 044/0/016/2/200     P Paaggee 3 4 o of f4 5   Page ID\n \n #:5175\n \n \n \n1 \n \nconcerned for my client. I asked for more information. I did not receive a response to that \n    \n2 \nemail. \n3 \n9.  At 11:50am, I received a call from Ms. Avalos Barrios from the LaSalle Detention \n4 \nFacility. During our phone call, Ms. Avalos Barrios told me that she was not able to have \n5 \nthe VTC call with me that morning because she and the entire female population at \n6 \nLaSalle Detention Facility had been tear gassed. \n7 \n10. Ms. Avalos Barrios proceeded to tell me that the approximately 80 women detained at the \n8 \nLaSalle Detention Facility were receiving a presentation from officers about COIVD-19. \n9 \nMs. Avalos Barrios informed me that during the presentation, the women had questions \n10 \nabout the virus and were expressing fears about their safety in the detention center. Ms. \n11 \nAvalos Barrios stated that the women’s questions were going unanswered and their \n12 \nconcerns were being ignored by the officers.  \n13 \n11. Ms. Avalos Barrios then informed me that the officers grew impatient and angry with the \n14 \nwomen and released tear gas into the room where they were giving the presentation. The \n15 \nofficers promptly left the room and locked the doors. \n16 \n12. Ms. Avalos Barrios told me that her and the rest of the women were left locked inside the \n17 \nroom with tear gas for approximately one hour. She stated that the women were screaming \n18 \nto be let out of the room, but no one came to their aid.  \n19 \n13. Ms. Avalos Barrios stated that the women were coughing, crying, and that some fainted \n20 \nthroughout the approximately one hour that they were locked in the room with tear gas. \n21 \n14. Ms. Avalos Barrios said that after approximately one hour, officers came and unlocked the \n22 \ndoors, and they entered wearing full protective face gear to prevent effects of the tear gas. \n23 \n15. Ms. Avalos Barrios informed me that, as we were speaking, her eyes were red and burning \n24 \nand that her whole neck area and throat were in pain. \n25 \n16. In the middle of our conversation, the call was lost and I did not receive a call back from. \n26 \nMs. Avalos Barrios. I called the ICE Processing Center to attempt to be reconnected with \n27  Ms. Avalos Barrios, but I was informed that it was not possible at that time. \n28 \n  2 \n  \n\nCase 5:17-Ccva-s0e2 521:240-J-cGvB-0-1S0H9K3      DDooccuummeenntt  225-332-4     F Filieledd 0 044/0/016/2/200     P Paaggee 4 5 o of f4 5   Page ID\n \n #:5176\n \n \n \n1 \n \n \n    \n2  Dated:  April 1, 2020     Respectfully submitted, \n3 \nOakland, California        ____/s/Mariel Villarreal___  \n4 \n5 \nMariel Villarreal \n            Pangea Legal Services \n6 \n            Immigration Attorney \n7              Pangea Legal Services \n            350 Sansome St., Suite 650 \n8              San Francisco, CA 94104 \n \n9 \n \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n  3 \n  ",

GEO’s HUSP violated human trafficking laws before the COVID-19 \n7 \nepidemic, but GEO’s cost-cutting HUSP program now threatens Class Members’ lives.  \n8 \nGEO contests a great many aspects of Plaintiffs’ application. But it cannot \n9 \ncontest the central reality of this moment: a highly contagious, deadly, and incurable \n10 \nvirus that has ravaged the world and swept across America is now spreading at an \n11 \nexponential rate inside this country’s immigration detention centers:  \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \nSource: www.ice.gov/coronavirus (Confirmed Cases tab).  \n21 \nTime is of the essence. And the HUSP Class is running out of it. If Class \n22 \nMembers  are  to  be  spared  the  likelihood  of  infection  by  the  thousands  and \n23 \nhospitalization or death in the hundreds, the Court must act now. Assurances by GEO \n24 \nwardens and federal officials that they are “monitoring”—but not actually following—\n25 \nguidelines by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) fall flat when \n26 \n1  \nPLAINTIFFS’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF THEIR   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \nEX PARTE APPLICATION FOR A TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER \n \n   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 259   Filed 04/12/20   Page 8 of 28   Page ID #:5490\n1  measured against the results of these efforts and the impulse of GEO’s profit-driven \n2  motives.1  \n3  GEO’s HUSP program exceeds the company’s lawful authority from the federal \n4  government and forces Class Members to perform labor for GEO under threats for \n5  force, abuse of process, and other serious harms. While Class Members will prove the \n6  merits of their claim in trial, the parties’ present dispute centers on whether the risk of \n7  harm to Class Members in light of the COVID-19 epidemic is so immediate and so \n8  irreparable as to require emergency intervention by this Court.  \n9  On the record before the Court, GEO cannot meaningfully contest that its \n10  practice of forcing Class Members to clean and sanitize and disinfect common living \n11  areas puts Class Members at far greater risk of infection, disease, and death than if GEO \n12  staff performed the cleaning tasks. Similarly, and in the alternative, simply providing \n13  Class Members with sufficient personal protective equipment, cleaning supplies, and \n14  COVID-19 testing to ensure their safety would mitigate this immediate, present risk.  \n15  For GEO, risking Class Members’ lives is a business decision: protecting them \n16  costs money. Instead, GEO chooses to force Class Members to perform sanitation \n17  tasks without protection. The Court should stop GEO’s unprotected implementation \n18  of the HUSP program in order to protect Class Members from COVID-19 exposure. \n19  In the present circumstance, the law calls for relief for the Class Members.  \n20 \n21 \n \n22 \n1 Notably, on the day Plaintiffs filed the TRO application, GEO announced a nearly $60 million dividend to its \nshareholders:  \n23 \nWe are pleased to declare a quarterly cash dividend of $0.48 per share, or $1.92 \nper share annualized, which is indicative of our continued commitment to \n24 \nreturn value to our shareholders. \nGeorge C.

The  Merits:  Plaintiffs’  Nationwide  HUSP  allegations  pertain  to \nlabor beyond the scope of required personal housekeeping tasks \n5  enumerated in the PBNDS.  \n6  Plaintiffs allege—and GEO admits—that GEO maintains HUSPs at each of its \n7  facilities requiring Class Members to perform cleaning and sanitization work without \n8  remuneration outside their immediate living areas.2 Because Section 5.8.V.C of the \n9  federal Performance-Based National Detention Standards (“PBNDS”) provides only \n10  four enumerated tasks GEO can force detained immigrants to perform without pay \n11  under threat of sanctions, and GEO’s HUSPs go beyond those four tasks, Plaintiffs \n12  contend GEO is liable for violating the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (“TVPA”).  \n13  GEO muddies the waters by conflating its HUSP with the PBNDS. But the \n14  PBNDS does not give it a blank check to compel cleaning and sanitation of common \n15  areas. And GEO uses phrases like “cleaning up after themselves,” “housekeeping \n16  duties,” “keeping one’s area clean,” and “cleaning one’s living area”3 to describe to \n17  GEO’s HUSP program when that is not what this case is about. The TVPA claims of \n18  the Nationwide HUSP Class have always been about GEO’s HUSP program, and that \n19  remains true today.  \n20  B. The Harm: GEO forces Class Members to face increased risk of \nexposure  to  COVID-19  by  requiring  they  clean  common  areas \n21  without reliable access to soap, sanitizer, disinfectants, or PPE. \n22  GEO states that “Plaintiffs provide absolutely no evidence that detainees are at \n23  a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 by cleaning up after themselves in their general \n24 \n \n25 \n2 See Dkt. 223 at 3–7 (setting forth PBNDS § 5.8.V.C-permitted tasks and contrasting with the labor GEO \nrequires through its HUSP program. See also Dkt. 252 at 5–7 (discussing the HUSP program). \n26 \n3 See, e.g., Dkt. 255 at 8. \n3  \nPLAINTIFFS’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF THEIR   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \nEX PARTE APPLICATION FOR A TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER \n \n   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 259   Filed 04/12/20   Page 10 of 28   Page ID\n #:5492\n1  living areas.” The assertion defies both logic and the CDC’s recommendations.4 By \n2  definition, people are exposed to whatever they are cleaning. And GEO’s HUSP \n3  program compels this exposure because GEO refuses either to supply Class Members \n4  with proper PPE and cleaning chemicals or to pay its own employees to do the \n5  cleaning.5 This unprotected, preventable exposure of Class Members to COVID-19, \n6  along with the illness and death it will cause them, combine to present immediate, \n7  irreparable harm to Class Members because of GEO’s unlawful forced labor policy.  \n8  C. The Relief: Plaintiffs seek an order enjoining GEO’s HUSPs to \nensure that anyone who cleans their common living areas is safe.  \n9 \nGEO  describes  the  relief  requested  as  “the  elimination  of  housekeeping \n10 \nrequirements”  and,  later,  suggest  that  “Plaintiffs  proposed  relief  .  .  .  would  be \n11 \ninconsistent with the clear guidance from the CDC.”6 But Plaintiffs are not asking that \n12 \nGEO cease cleaning common areas; rather, Plaintiffs simply seek to have GEO stop \n13 \nforcing Class Members to perform these tasks in violation of the PBNDS and TVPA. \n14 \nAcknowledging that the nature of the global pandemic may present staffing challenges \n15 \nfor  GEO,7  Class  Members  alternatively  propose  an  order  requiring  GEO  to \n16 \nimmediately equip Class Members with PPE when performing the work, and supply \n17 \nsufficient  testing  to  avoid  community  spread  through  GEO’s  use  of  detained \n18 \nimmigrants to conduct the cleaning tasks GEO cannot perform using its own workers. \n19 \n20   \n4 So too does the assertion that “it is unclear how detainees are at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 by \n21  complying with a policy that serves to ensure that basic tenets of personal hygiene are followed.”  \n5 Second Declaration of Daniel Charest, Ex.

But GEO resists even this. And, to protect the Class Members, \n5  the Court should grant the injunctive relief Plaintiffs seek.  \n6    REBUTTAL EVIDENCE  \n7   What Doctors Say: All epidemiology supports injunctive relief. \n8  GEO  presents  the  Court  with  a  number  of  declarations  by  non-medical \n9  personnel attesting to the sufficiency of the company’s alleged efforts to prevent the \n10  spread of COVID-19 within its facilities. To rebut these declarations, Plaintiffs offer \n11  declarations from four leading medical experts who offer their opinions as to the efforts \n12  GEO and ICE describe.8  \n13  Doctor Adam Kimball Richards, a licensed California infectious disease clinician, \n14  who is himself treating COVID-19 patients in the Los Angeles area, offers his opinion \n15  regarding the grave risk of harm GEO’s HUSP program poses to Class Members at \n16  Adelanto. Based on his review of the Valdez and Janecka declarations, Dr. Richards \n17  concludes that GEO’s sub-par efforts to control COVID-19 in its facilities does not \n18  provide sufficient protection for the Class Members involved in the HUSP: \n19 \nBy failing to provide these basic needs and requiring Class Members to clean, \ndisinfect, and sanitize[ ] their common living areas without adequate supplies, \n20 \nGEO exposes them to a heightened risk of serious illness or death.9  \n21 \n22 \n23   \n8 Richards Decl. ¶¶ 8–14, 19–46 (analyzing the Valdez and Janecka Declarations);   Venters Decl. ¶¶ 1–5 \n24 \n(analyzing ICE declarations regarding the agency’s COVID-19 response); Ex.

In sum, the procedures Officer \n19 \nCeja lays out fall woefully short of a responsible, evidence-based public health \n20  approach to combatting the spread of this deadly pandemic.11 \n21 \nFinally, Dr. Marc Stern, who served for four years as a subject-matter expert on \n22 \nhealthcare in immigration detention for the Department of Homeland Security’s Office \n23 \nfor Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, has declared that the risk of spreading COVID-19 \n24 \n25   \n10 Venters Decl. ¶ 3.e (emphasis added).  \n26 \n11 Franco-Paredes Decl. ¶¶ 29–31. \n6  \nPLAINTIFFS’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF THEIR   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \nEX PARTE APPLICATION FOR A TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER \n \n   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 259   Filed 04/12/20   Page 13 of 28   Page ID\n #:5495\n1  is significantly increased once the virus is introduced because detention centers are \n2  congregate environments.12 He opines that GEO is “failing to implement COVID-19 \n3  infection control measures recommended by the CDC[ ]” at its Mesa Verde facility.13  \n4  Other key pieces of evidence deserve mention here:  \n5  •  “The process of wiping, scrubbing or otherwise removing virus particles from \npotentially contaminated surfaces increases aerosolization of viral particles \n6 \nand  increases  risk  of  infection.  Anyone  cleaning  these  areas  should  be \n7  provided with PPE.”14  \n8  •  CDC guidance explicitly states that the CDC Recommendations apply to \ndetainees as well as staff in detention facilities: \n9 \n“Note  that  these  recommendations  apply  to  staff  as  well  as  to \n10 \nincarcerated/detained  individuals  who  may  come  in  contact  with \ncontaminated materials during the course of their work placement in the \n11 \nfacility (e.g., cleaning).”15 \n12 \n•  “GEO’s decision to require detained immigrants to continue cleaning and \n13 \ndisinfecting common areas inside their dorms and pods at Adelanto without \nproviding them personal protective equipment, adequate sanitization and \n14 \ndisinfectant supplies, and adequate access to soap, hot water, and paper \n15 \ntowels places Class Members at Adelanto at an increased risk of contracting, \nbecoming ill, and potentially dying from COVID-19, as well as spreading the \n16 \nvirus if they are asymptomatic carriers.”16  \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23   \n12 Stern Decl. ¶ 7 (“Detention facilities are congregate environments, i.e. places where people live and sleep in \n24 \nclose proximity.”).    \n13 Stern Decl. ¶ 9. \n25 \n14 Richards Decl. ¶ 40 (emphasis added).  \n15 Richards Decl. ¶ 43 (emphasis added) (quoting CDC guidelines). \n26 \n16 Richards Decl. ¶ 45 (emphasis added).  \n7  \nPLAINTIFFS’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF THEIR   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \nEX PARTE APPLICATION FOR A TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER \n \n   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 259   Filed 04/12/20   Page 14 of 28   Page ID\n #:5496\n What the CDC Says: CDC COVID-19 guidelines for correctional \n1  and detention facilities require cleaning supplies and PPE.  \n2  In response to the COVID-19 epidemic, the CDC established guidelines for \n3  correctional and detention facilities and law enforcement agencies that have custodial \n4  authority for detained populations (i.e., U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement).17  \n5  To comply with CDC guidelines, GEO facilities must ensure sufficient stocks of \n6  cleaning supplies (including hand drying supplies and EPA-registered disinfectants that \n7  are effective against the virus that causes COVID-19) and PPE (including facemasks, \n8  N95 respirators, eye protection, disposable medical gloves, and disposable gowns/one-\n9  piece suits).18 Similarly, the CDC recommends that anyone who performs the cleaning \n10  of  these  spaces  wears  the  recommended  PPE  of  N95  respirators,  facemasks,  eye \n11  protection, gloves, and gowns/coveralls.19 Indeed, the CDC has specific PPE and hand \n12  hygiene guidelines for those who are responsible for the cleaning and disinfection of \n13  community facilities like a correctional or detention facility.20 Cleaning staff should wear \n14  disposable gloves and gowns for all tasks in the cleaning process, including while \n15  handling trash.21 The gloves and gowns worn should be compatible with the cleaning \n16  or disinfectant product that is being used and additional PPE might be required based \n17  on the cleaning or disinfectant product being used and whether there is a risk of splash.22  \n18 \n19   \n17 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-\n20 \n19)  in  Correctional  and  Detention  Facilities  (updated  Apr.  9,  2020),  available  at \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-\n21 \ndetention.html# (last accessed April 10, 2020).   \n18 Id.  \n22 \n19 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-\n19)  in  Correctional  and  Detention  Facilities  (updated  Apr.  9,  2020),  available  at \n23 \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-\ndetention.html#.  \n24 \n20 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Cleaning and Disinfection for Community Facilities (updated April 1, \n2020)  available  at  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/organizations/cleaning-\n25 \ndisinfection.html. \n21 Id.  \n26 \n22 Id.  \n8  \nPLAINTIFFS’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF THEIR   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \nEX PARTE APPLICATION FOR A TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER \n \n   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 259   Filed 04/12/20   Page 15 of 28   Page ID\n #:5497\n What  Class  Members  Say:  GEO’s  assurances  about  COVID-19 \n1  precautions do not comport with reality. \n2  In response to the factual representations by GEO’s facility administrators at \n3  Adelanto, Aurora, Tacoma, and LaSalle, Class Members and their advocates offer sworn \n4  testimony from Class Members,23 their lawyers,24 and their community advocates25 \n5  recounting  the  lived  experiences  of  people  locked  inside  GEO’s  facilities.

By contrast, this case concerns the \n13  certified Nationwide HUSP Class of thousands of detained immigrants who are forced \n14  to implement GEO’s “total sanitation mission” by cleaning “all commonly accessible \n15  areas of the unit” including “microwaves, tables, and chairs.”30  \n16  While GEO correctly lists the three requirements of standing, “injury-in-fact, \n17  causation, and redressability,”31 the question for this case is whether they are met based \n18  on the claims as plead and the record before this Court: a certified class that seeks \n19  injunctive relief to bar using Class Members to provide services under the HUSPs. \n20 \n21   \n27 Merton Decl. ¶¶ 5–10 (Adelanto, LaSalle, Northwest, Aurora, South Louisiana); Yoon Decl. ¶ 17 (Folkston); \n22 \nRussell Decl. ¶¶ 7–10 (South Texas).  \n28 Merton Decl. ¶¶ 5–9 (Adelanto, LaSalle, Northwest, Aurora, South Louisiana); Yoon Decl. ¶ 9 (Folkston); \n23 \nHuber Decl. ¶¶ 19–20, 22–23 (Jena, Pine Prairie, South Louisiana); A.A.L.

And Article III standing \n2  is present here for the HUSP Class to seek that relief. \n3  1.  Class Members face an injury that is “concrete and \nparticularized” and “actual or imminent.” \n4 \n“To satisfy the ‘injury in fact’ requirement, plaintiffs must allege an imminent \n5 \nthreat of concrete injury, and must distinguish themselves from the public at large by \n6 \ndemonstrating that the alleged injury ‘affect[s them] in a personal and individual way.’”35 \n7 \nActual injury need not be proven; a “concrete risk of harm . . . is sufficient for injury in \n8 \nfact.”36 That requirement is met because the injuries and rights abuse original outlined \n9 \nin the complaint remain. And, added to those, Class Members face an imminent threat \n10 \nof severe illness and death.  \n11 \n2.  The  threatened  injury  is  “fairly  traceable  to  the \n12  challenged action” of GEO. \n13  For Article III purposes, standing’s causation element “requires a showing that \n14  [the] injury is ‘fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant, and not the \n15  result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.’”37 The \n16  causation component is met here since Class Members are less likely to contract \n17  COVID-19 if they do not participate in the HUSP.  \n18  On this issue, GEO posits yet another a false framing of Plaintiffs’ claims. \n19  Plaintiffs do not contend that “ending general housekeeping policies would make it less \n20 \n \n21 \nfrom being forced to provide “janitorial, maintenance, or other work at a GEO civil immigration detention \nfacility above and beyond the four personal housekeeping tasks enumerated in the ICE PBNDS pursuant to \n22 \nGEO’s HUSP”). \n35 Harris v.

But GEO should employ properly \n7  screened and protected workers to do so. In light of GEO’s April 6 dividend of $.48 \n8  per share (which amounts to nearly $60 million), GEO has the resources to hire, equip, \n9  and pay workers who accept its risks, rather than Class Members, who do the work \n10  under force. GEO chooses not to pay for Class Members’ work. GEO chooses to put \n11  Class  Members  in  those  situations  without  PPE  and  training.41  Either  way,  the \n12  requested relief will reduce the spread of COVID-19 among Class Members. \n13  3.  The Court can redress Plaintiffs’ claims. \n14  To establish redressability, a plaintiff must show that it is “likely, as opposed to \n15  merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.”42 The \n16  burden  to  demonstrate  redressability  is  “relatively  modest.”43  A  party  “need  not \n17  demonstrate that there is a ‘guarantee’ that [her] injuries will be redressed by a favorable \n18 \n19 \n20 \n \n21 \n38 GEO Response, Dkt. 255 at 10. \n39 Id. \n22 \n40 See Dkt. 184 at 48–51.

GEO Response, Dkt. 255 at 8–9. But, as this Court is aware, the VWP Class \nis only for detainees at the Adelanto Facility, and each one of those detainees is a member of the HUSP Class, \n24 \nrendering GEO’s argument disingenuous at best. \n41 Indeed, a telling revelation would be whether GEO would (or even could) get “outside” workers to perform \n25 \nthe HUSP tasks without the PPE and supplies it has not provided to Class Members. \n42 Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561. \n26 \n43 Renee v.

Moreover, “[t]he scope of injunctive \n6  relief is dictated by the extent of the violation established.”46 Entry of the requested \n7  order will protect Class Members system wide, a result that “can prevent a ‘flood of \n8  duplicative litigation’ by allowing similarly situated non-party individuals to benefit from \n9  an injunction rather than filing separate actions for similar relief.”47 \n10  On the record before the Court, Plaintiffs meet and exceed the required showing \n11  for the relief requested.  \n12   Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief.  \n13 \ni.  Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits.  \n14 \nRather than address the TVPA claim that the Nationwide HUSP Class actually \n15 \nasserts, GEO’s opposition fabricates two of its own and knocks those down instead. \n16 \nThe Court should reject GEO’s straw-man arguments. \n17 \nFirst, GEO argues that a policy it does not implement complies with the TVPA. \n18 \nSpecifically,  it  argues  that  Barrientos  v.  CoreCivic,  Inc.  “explicitly  endorsed  the \n19 \nhousekeeping procedures at issue in this action.”48 GEO’s argument misstates the \n20 \n21   \n44 Id. \n22 \n45 Mayfield v.

As is clear from the \n25 \nmany declarations submitted in this and other actions in this District, litigation seeking to protect detainees from \nthe COVID-19 threat is pending in courts across the country. \n26 \n48 Dkt. 255 at 12. \n14   \nPLAINTIFFS’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF THEIR   5:17-cv-02514-JGB \nEX PARTE APPLICATION FOR A TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER \n \n   \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02514-JGB-SHK   Document 259   Filed 04/12/20   Page 21 of 28   Page ID\n #:5503\n1  record and minimizes its own HUSP. The court in Barrientos declined to “call into \n2  question longstanding requirements that detainees or inmates be required to perform \n3  basic  housekeeping  tasks.”49  But  basic  housekeeping  in  Barrientos  means  “certain \n4  ‘personal housekeeping’ tasks such as “making their bunk beds daily,’ ‘stacking loose \n5  papers,’ and ‘keeping the floor free of debris.’”50 The Barrientos court noted, however, \n6  that  “forc[ing]  detainees  to  perform  labor  (beyond  personal  housekeeping  tasks)” \n7  violates the TVPA.51  \n8  GEO’s HUSP requires detainees to do more than the personal housekeeping in \n9  Barrientos. GEO’s HUSP provides that “all Housing Units will be subject to a total \n10  sanitation mission to assure standards are met and maintained.”52 And this assignment \n11  is not voluntary. If the HUSP Class does not comply with the HUSP, GEO threatens \n12  them with punishment.53 Further, the Court has rejected the argument that these tasks \n13  cannot constitute a TVPA violation three times: twice when it denied GEO’s two \n14  motions to dismiss and, again, when it certified the Nationwide HUSP Class.54  \n15  Second, GEO asserts that a claim (which the Class does not assert) is unlikely to \n16  succeed. In this regard, GEO argues that Plaintiffs cannot show a likelihood of success \n17  on the merits because they have not shown that their exposure to COVID-19 violates \n18  the TVPA.55 This argument conflates the likelihood-of-success and irreparable-harm \n19  inquiries.

What \n7  has changed, however, is the urgency of the need for equitable relief. And while GEO’s \n8  violations of forced-labor law has always been illegal, it now threatens Class Members \n9  with serious illness and death.  \n10 \nii.  The Nationwide HUSP Class will suffer irreparable harm \nin the absence of an injunction. \n11 \n12  Each time GEO forces the Nationwide HUSP Class to clean common areas \n13  without proper personal protective equipment carries the potential that Class Members \n14  will contract COVID-19, fall gravely ill, and possibly die. GEO, nonetheless, asserts \n15  that  reducing  the  Class’s  exposure  to  high-touch  surfaces  or  providing  the  Class \n16  protective equipment while cleaning those surfaces “would not meaningfully reduce the \n17  spread of COVID-19” in its facilities.57 But exempting the Nationwide HUSP Class \n18  from the HUSP during the COVID-19 epidemic will completely eliminate the risk that \n19  GEO’s TVPA violations will expose Class Members to COVID-19. That GEO believes \n20  the virus will spread in its facilities even after this risk is eliminated only underscores \n21  the urgency of the Class’s motion. \n22  GEO argues that the movants are not in detention, so they “will not suffer any \n23  harm regardless of the outcome of this motion.”58 In doing so, GEO conflates a \n24   \n56 Michigan v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 667 F.3d 765, 787–88 (7th Cir. 2011); see also Trudeau v. Bockstein, No. \n25 \n05-CV-1019 GLS-RFT, 2008 WL 3413903, at *4 (N.D.N.Y.

As explained above, the HUSP Class has standing \n4  to bring this motion. And there is little doubt that the thousands of Class Members \n5  currently in detention will benefit by reducing contact with high-touch surfaces, having \n6  personal protective equipment, and being tested for COVID-19.  \n7  GEO also argues that the availability of habeas relief “negat[es] the need for \n8  injunctive relief.”59 This argument completely misses the point. GEO may well be right \n9  that the conditions of confinement in its facilities are so poor as to merit habeas relief \n10  against the federal government. But that does not change the analysis as to GEO. \n11  Regardless of whether the HUSP Class has causes of action against non-parties, GEO’s \n12  violation of the TVPA still subjects the HUSP Class to an injury that cannot be \n13  remedied at law—severe illness and death. Courts regularly and correctly find that these \n14  are irreparable harms that merit injunctive relief.60  \n15  Moreover, the only case GEO cites in support of this argument, Hernandez v. \n16  Wolf, disproves GEO’s position. In Hernandez, the plaintiff filed a petition for a writ of \n17  habeas corpus alleging that the conditions of his confinement in GEO’s detention \n18  facility  violated  his  constitutional  rights.61  The  plaintiff  then  filed  a  motion  for  a \n19  temporary restraining order demanding the immediate release from the facility.62 Were \n20  GEO correct that the ability of habeas relief precluded injunctive relief, the court would \n21 \n \n22 \n59 Dkt. 255 at 14. \n60 Harris v.

It did not. The court granted the plaintiff’s motion \n2  and released him from GEO’s custody without a final judgment on the merits of his \n3  habeas petition.63 \n4 \niii.  The balance of the equities and the public interest favor \na temporary restraining order. \n5 \n6  GEO does not even try to address whether balancing the equities favors a \n7  temporary restraining order. The result of that inquiry is clear: The Nationwide HUSP \n8  Class’s interest in reducing their exposure to a potentially deadly virus outweighs GEO’s \n9  economic interest in obtaining unpaid labor through violations of federal human-\n10  trafficking law.64 And GEO suffers no injury when it is forced to comply with the law \n11  or the PBNDS.65 To the contrary, GEO admits that its staff, administration, and \n12  families will benefit by reducing the HUSP Class’s exposure to COVID-19.66  \n13  Rather than tangle with this issue, GEO only addresses whether a temporary \n14  restraining order favors the public interest. Both parties agree that “the best methods \n15  for preventing spread of COVID-19 . . . include ‘routinely cleaning and disinfecting \n16  surfaces and objects that are frequently touched.’”67 Plaintiffs only ask that GEO’s staff \n17  do this work.

But does so without protection. And the \n2  public interests are served by cleanliness that does not infect Class Members.  \n3  GEO’s  argument  against  protecting  Class  Members  falsely assumes  that  its \n4  facilities will go uncleaned without the unpaid labor it has obtained by threats and uses \n5  of force. If GEO cannot perform the HUSP tasks with its own paid labor force, \n6  Plaintiffs’  motion  provides  another  option:  “protect  those  detainees  who  provide \n7  HUSP services by (i) providing protective clothing and antiseptic supplies and (ii) \n8  conducting testing of all Class Members to detect COVID-19.”69 To that, GEO has no \n9  answer on the merits.  \n10  As a last resort, GEO argues the temporary restraining order weighs against the \n11  public interest because all nationwide injunctions are against the public interest.70 The \n12  Ninth Circuit and its District Courts disagree. The only courts that have expressed \n13  reservations  about  a  court’s  ability  to  enter  a  nationwide  TRO  were  limited  to \n14  injunctions issued before class certification.71 There is no such concern in this case, as \n15  the Court has already certified a nationwide HUSP Class.72  \n16    CONCLUSION \n17 \nFor  the  foregoing  reasons,  Plaintiffs  request  this  Court  grant  a  temporary \n18 \nrestraining  order  in  the  form  submitted  and  set  this  matter  for  determination  of \n19 \nextending its ruling in the form of a preliminary injunction. \n20 \n21   \n69 Dkt. 252 at 2. \n22 \n70 Dkt. 255 at 19 (describing a district court’s ability to issue a nationwide injunction as “tenuous at best”). \n71 Los Angeles Haven Hospice, Inc. v.
