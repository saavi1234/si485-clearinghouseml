    "summary": "<p>On November 14, 2018, immigrants detained at the Cibola County Correctional Center filed this putative class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. (Although the facility in question is located in New Mexico, the operator was organized as a Maryland corporation.) They sued the operator of the facility, CoreCivic, under the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 201-219), the New Mexico Minimum Wage Act, and the common law doctrine of unjust enrichment. The suit alleged that CoreCivic was using immigrant detainees&rsquo; labor but paying them less than the federally mandated rate of $7.25 per hour (sometimes as little as $1 per day). Represented by private counsel, they sought to recover underpaid wages and attorneys&rsquo; fees and require CoreCivic to treat all current and future Cibola detainees as employees so that they would be entitled to minimum wage. The case was assigned to Judge Richard D. Bennett.</p>\r\n<p>CoreCivic filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim on January 11, 2019, arguing that the plaintiffs&rsquo; custodial detention prevented them from assuming an employee/employer relationship. As such, CoreCivic argued, the plaintiffs were not eligible for the minimum wage under the statutes, and the unjust enrichment claim should therefore fail as well.</p>\r\n<p>On February 26, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a motion to conditionally certify a class consisting of \"all civilly detained immigrants who performed work for CoreCivic at Cibola through its work program at any time during the period beginning November 14, 2016, and continuing to the date on which notice is issued.\" The plaintiffs argued that their detention and working conditions at Cibola are sufficient conditions to meet the &ldquo;similarly-situated&rdquo; threshold required to file a class action lawsuit.</p>\r\n<p>The district court dismissed the plaintiffs&rsquo; claims with prejudice on September 27, 2019. It held that the plaintiffs were not employees of CoreCivic and therefore not entitled to minimum wage. Because CoreCivic was not in violation of any statute, the unjust enrichment claim was also dismissed. 2019 WL 4735428. In light of this dismissal, the court did not reach the issue of class certification.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs appealed this decision to the Fourth Circuit in October 2019 (USCA No. 19-2207). Briefing was completed in January 2020. Oral argument was rescheduled a number of times due to counsel's unavailability; from the docket it appears the case was eventually decided without oral argument.</p>\r\n<p>The Fourth Circuit affirmed the district court's order on March 5, 2021. Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III wrote the opinion, which Judges Barbara Milano Keenan and Albert Diaz joined. The court of appeals agreed that the plaintiffs were not \"employees\" that qualified for FLSA protections because the detainer-detainee relationship is \"outside [the] paradigm\" of the employer-employee relationship that FLSA governs. This was so, the court found, regardless of the fact that the plaintiffs participated in a voluntary work program involving the transfer of money from detainer to detainee. The court noted that the other circuits who had considered this question &ndash;&ndash; 10 of them &ndash;&ndash; had all held that detainees are not FLSA employees. 990 F.3d 369. Subsequently, the Fourth Circuit denied rehearing <em>en banc&nbsp;</em>on April 2, 2021.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The case is now closed.&nbsp;</p>",

Plaintiffs seek \ncertification of the following collective: \nall civilly detained immigrants who performed work for CoreCivic at Cibola \nthrough its work program at any time during the period beginning November 14, \n2016, and continuing to the date on which notice is issued. \n \nNotwithstanding  the  pending  Motion  to  Dismiss  (ECF  No.  36),  Plaintiffs  seek  conditional \ncertification and notice at this time because the limitations period for the FLSA claims of putative \ncollective members runs until each person affected by the challenged practice has consented to \njoin the lawsuit.

(Compl. ¶¶ 1-3, ECF No. 1.)  They bring this purported class \naction against Defendant, CoreCivic Inc. (“CoreCivic”), who owns and operates the detention \nfacility where Plaintiffs were held pursuant to an Intergovernmental Service Agreement \nbetween ICE and Cibola County.  (Id. at ¶ 19.)  Defendant operates a work program at Cibola \nwhere detainees are permitted to voluntarily perform work duties in the facility.  (Id. at ¶ 26.)  \nPlaintiffs participated in this work program at Cibola.  (Id. ¶¶ 34-54.)  Plaintiffs filed a \ncomplaint in this Court based on federal question, diversity, and supplemental jurisdiction \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 13311, 13322, and 13673.  (Id. at ¶¶ 4-8.)  Plaintiffs allege they were \n                                              \n1   29 U.S.C. § 206 (Fair Labor Standards Act) is a Federal Statute.   \n2   Defendant is organized under Maryland Law, and at least one class member of the purported \nclass action is of diverse citizenship from Defendant.   \n3   This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over the New Mexico State law claims as they arise \nout of the same occurrence as the alleged Federal claim.   \n\nCase 1:18-cv-03521-RDB   Document 49   Filed 09/27/19   Page 2 of 6\nemployees of CoreCivic under the Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”) and New Mexico \nMinimum Wage Act (“NMMWA”) and were paid at a rate below that which is required by the \nFLSA and NMMWA and that the Defendant was unjustly enriched by these alleged violations.  \n(Id. at ¶¶ 89-110)  Defendant filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to \nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) arguing that Plaintiffs’ claims should be dismissed as the Plaintiffs \nwere not “employees” under the FLSA and NMMWA and, thus, not required to be paid \nminimum wage.  (Mot. Mem. 1, ECF No. 36-1.)   \nNow pending before this Court is Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 36) and \nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Conditional Certification and Issuance of Notice (ECF No. 43).  The \nparties’ submissions have been reviewed, and no hearing is necessary.  See Local Rule 105.6 \n(D. Md. 2018).  As discussed below, Plaintiffs cannot be considered “employees” of the \nDefendant during their detention.  Therefore, this Court shall GRANT Defendant’s dismissal \nmotion, and Plaintiffs’ motion for certification shall be DENIED AS MOOT.                 \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nUnder Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a complaint must contain \na “short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.” Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Rule 12(b)(6) authorizes the dismissal of a complaint if it fails to state a claim \nupon which relief can be granted. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  While a complaint need not include \n“detailed factual allegations,” it must set forth “enough factual matter (taken as true) to \nsuggest” a cognizable cause of action. Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555-56 (2007); \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). In reviewing a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a court “ ‘must \naccept as true all of the factual allegations contained in the complaint’ ” and must “ ‘draw all \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-03521-RDB   Document 49   Filed 09/27/19   Page 3 of 6\nreasonable inferences [from those facts] in favor of the plaintiff.’ ” E.I. du Pont de Nemours & \nCo. v. Kolon Indus., Inc., 637 F.3d 435, 440 (4th Cir. 2011) (citations omitted); Hall v. DirectTV, \nLLC, 846 F.3d 757, 765 (4th Cir. 2017). However, a court is not required to accept legal \nconclusions drawn from those facts. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. \nANALYSIS \nI.  Plaintiffs were not employees under the FLSA and NMMWA as they were \ndetainees being held in anticipation of civil immigration proceedings.  \nPlaintiffs contend that they were entitled to be paid a minimum wage by the Defendant \nfor work program they engaged in while being held as detainees at Cibola.  Plaintiffs allege \nthat they were employees, as defined by the FLSA and NMMWA, and that, as employees, \nDefendant was required to pay them the minimum wage as set by the federal government and \nthe State of New Mexico.  (Compl. at ¶¶ 34-54, ECF No. 1.)  Defendant argues that the \nPlaintiffs were not employees, as they were detainees being held in custody pending civil \nimmigration proceedings and the economic reality of the detention could not have given rise \nto an employment relationship as contemplated by the FLSA and NMMWA.  (Mot. Mem. 12, \nECF 36-1.) \n  Both the FLSA and NMMWA require employers to compensate employees for all \nhours worked at a rate that is not less than the minimum wage.  29 U.S.C. § 206(a)(1); NM ST \n§ 4-22.  The FLSA and NMMWA only apply to “employees.”  29 U.S.C. § 206(a)(1); NM ST \n§ 4-22.   The definition of employee in the FLSA and NMMWA are similar.  Garcia v. American \nFurniture Co., 689 P.2d 934, 937 (N.M. Ct. App. 1984) (noting that the definition of “employ” \nwas almost identical in the New Mexico statute as in the FLSA).  Courts generally look to the \n“economic reality” of an individual’s status in determining whether they are an “employee.”  \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-03521-RDB   Document 49   Filed 09/27/19   Page 4 of 6\nGoldberg v. Whitaker House Coop., Inc., 366 U.S. 28, 33 (1961).  The Fourth Circuit has held that \nprisoners are not “employees” under the FLSA.  Harker v. State Use Industries, 990 F.2d 131, \n133 (4th Cir. 1993).  The Fifth Circuit has held that civil immigration detainees, like prison \ninmates, are not “employees” as contemplated by the FLSA.  Alvarado Guevara v. I.N.S., 902 \nF. 2d 394, 396 (5th Cir. 1990).  \nIn this case, Plaintiffs cannot be considered “employees” as defined by the FLSA or \nNMMWA.  CoreCivic, under the Intergovernmental Service Agreement, was required to offer \na voluntary work program for ICE detainees at Cibola.  (Def. Mot. to Dismiss at 2 ECF No. \n36-1.)    Plaintiffs  were  incarcerated  detainees  in  this  facility  awaiting  civil  immigration \nproceedings and engaged in work offered by the Defendant on an entirely voluntary basis \nthrough this program.  (Compl. at ¶¶ 34-54 ECF No. 1.)  The economic reality of the Plaintiffs’ \nsituation is almost identical to a prison inmate and does not share commonality with that of a \ntraditional employer-employee relationship.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs were not “employees” of \nthe Defendant during their detention.                               \nII.  As Plaintiffs were not employees under the FLSA and NMMWA, their claims \nagainst CoreCivic pursuant to these laws (Counts I and II) must be dismissed.  \nIn order to bring a claim under the FLSA or NMMWA, Plaintiffs must show that they \nare employees of the Defendant.  29 U.S.C. § 206(a)(1); NM ST § 4-22.   In this case, Plaintiffs, \nas detainees, were not employees of CoreCivic and are not entitled to bring a claim against the \nDefendant under the FLSA or the NMMWA.  As a result, Plaintiffs’ claims under the FLSA \nand NMMWA shall be DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.       \nIII.  As  Defendant’s  actions  were  lawful,  Plaintiffs  claim  of  unjust  enrichment \n(Count III) must be dismissed.   \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-03521-RDB   Document 49   Filed 09/27/19   Page 5 of 6\nPlaintiffs also allege that Defendant’s use of their labor constitutes unjust enrichement \nin violation of New Mexico law.  (Compl. at ¶¶ 105-10 ECF No. 1.)  To prevail in an unjust \nenrichment claim “. . .one must show that: (1) another has been knowingly benefitted at one’s \nexpense (2) in a manner such that allowance of the other to retain the benefit would be unjust.”  \nOntiveros Insulation Co., Inc. v. Sanchez, 3 P.3d 695, 698 (N.M. Ct. App. 2000).  \nThe Plaintiffs’ claim of unjust enrichement against CoreCivic is entirely dependent on \nCoreCivic’s alleged violation of the FLSA and NMMWA.  (Compl. ECF No. 1 at 21-22.)  As \nDefendant’s actions in this case were not in violation of the FLSA or NMMWA since the \nPlaintiffs were not “employees”, Plaintiffs’ claim of unjust enrichment is not cognizable and \nshall be DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.        \nIV.  Plaintiffs’ Motion for Conditional Certification and Issuance of Notice must be \ndenied as moot.      \nAs the Plaintiffs have no cognizable claims, it is not necessary for this Court to analyze \nthe issue of conditional certification.  Accordingly, the Plaintiffs’ Motion for Conditional \nCertification and Issuance of Notice shall be DENIED AS MOOT.   \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, it is HEREBY ORDERED this 27th day of September 2019 that: \n1.  Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 36) is GRANTED;  \n2.  Plaintiffs Complaint (ECF No. 1) is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE; \n3.  Plaintiffs Motion for Conditional Certification and Issuance of Notice (ECF \nNo. 43) is DENIED AS MOOT; \n4.  The Clerk of Court shall transmit a copy of this Order to counsel of record; \n5.  The Clerk of Court shall CLOSE THIS CASE. \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-03521-RDB   Document 49   Filed 09/27/19   Page 6 of 6\n_______/s/_______________ \n              Richard D.

Plaintiffs  and  the  putative  class  members—all  former  or  current  civil  immigration \ndetainees in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”)—bring claims \nunder  the  Fair  Labor  Standards  Act  (“FLSA”)  and  the  New  Mexico  Minimum  Wage  Act \n(“NMMWA”).  They allege that they were underpaid for labor voluntarily performed while \ndetained in a New Mexico facility and awaiting removal proceedings.  Their claims, however, \nrely on the incorrect legal premise that they were “employees” of the detention facility’s private \noperator, CoreCivic.  As courts across the country have consistently concluded, they were not \nemployees because the economic reality of their custodial detention belies any indicia of a \ntraditional free-market-employment relationship.  Thus, as a matter of law, neither the FLSA nor \nthe NMMWA apply.  And because they were not entitled to federal or state statutory wages, their \nclaim for unjust enrichment fails as well.  The Court should dismiss all claims with prejudice. \n     \n\nCase 1:18-cv-03521-RDB   Document 36-1   Filed 01/11/19   Page 2 of 18\nI.  COMPLAINT ALLEGATIONS.1 \nPlaintiffs Desmond Ndambi, Mbah Emmanuel Abi, and Nkemtoh Moses are three former \nICE detainees who were detained at the Cibola County Correctional Center (“Cibola”) in Cibola \nCounty, New Mexico pending their removal proceedings.  (Doc. 1, ¶¶ 9–14 & 21.)  CoreCivic \nowns  and  operates  Cibola  pursuant  to  an  Intergovernmental  Service  Agreement  (“IGSA”) \nbetween ICE and Cibola County.  (Id., ¶¶ 15–17, 21, 23 & 24.)  Under that agreement, CoreCivic \nis required to maintain a voluntary work program for ICE detainees.  (Id., ¶ 26.) \nNdambi alleges that he was detained at Cibola from June 22, 2017, to October 1, 2017, \nand worked as a janitor and in the facility’s library.  (Id., ¶¶ 33-38.)  He alleges that he was paid \n$1 for each day that he worked.  (Id.)  Abi alleges that he was detained at Cibola from June 24, \n2017, to November 22, 2017, and worked as a janitor and in the facility’s kitchen.  (Id., ¶¶ 41-\n47.)  He alleges that he was paid $1 per day as a janitor and $15 per week as a kitchen worker.  \n(Id.)  Awombang alleges that he was detained at Cibola from June 20, 2017, to December 20, \n2017, and also worked as a janitor and kitchen worker for the same amounts.  (Id. ¶¶ 49-53.) \nIn Count I, Plaintiffs bring a claim under the FLSA and allege that they were entitled to \nthe federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour.  (Id., ¶¶ 89–96.)  They allege that CoreCivic was \nan  employer  under  29  U.S.C.  §  203(d),  and  that  they  were  employees  under  29  U.S.C.  \n§§ 203(e)(1) and (g).  (Id.)   In Count II, Plaintiffs bring a claim under the NMMWA and allege \nthat they were entitled to the state minimum wage of $7.50 per hour.  (Id., ¶¶ 99–104.)  They \nallege that CoreCivic was an employer under N.M. Stat. § 50-4-21.  (Id.)  Finally, in Count III, \n                                                 \n1 For purposes of this Motion, the Court must assume the allegations in the Complaint are \ntrue and construe them in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs.  See In re Human Genome Scis. \nInc. Sec. Litig., 933 F. Supp. 2d 751, 757 (D. Md. 2013). \n \n  - 2 -   \n\nCase 1:18-cv-03521-RDB   Document 36-1   Filed 01/11/19   Page 3 of 18\nPlaintiffs  bring  a  New  Mexico  unjust-enrichment  claim,  alleging  that  their  labor  relieved \nCoreCivic from having to employ others the minimum wages.  (Id., ¶¶ 46, 56, 57, 105–110.)  \nPlaintiffs seek to certify their FLSA claim as a collective action, pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 216(b), \nand their NMMWA and unjust enrichment claims as class actions, pursuant to Civil Rule 23, on \nbehalf of all civilly detained immigrants who performed work at Cibola in the two (or four) years \nprior to the complaint and prospectively.  (Id., ¶¶ 55-88.) \nII.  THE COMPLAINT FAILS TO STATE A VIABLE CLAIM. \n  Standard of Review. \nTo survive a motion to dismiss, a plaintiff must state a plausible claim.  Bell Atlantic \nCorp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  A complaint “requires more than labels and \nconclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.”  Id.  \nAlthough a court must accept as true all factual allegations, that principle “is inapplicable to legal \nconclusions.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  “Threadbare recitals of the elements \nof a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.”  Id.  Thus, the \nCourt cannot accept as true Plaintiffs’ allegations that they were “employees,” or that CoreCivic \nwas their “employer,” under the minimum wage laws.  Those are legal conclusions that this \nCourt must decide as a matter of law. \n  Plaintiffs’ FLSA Claim Should Be Dismissed.   \nCongress enacted the FLSA “to protect the standard of living and general well-being of \nthe American worker.”  Villarreal v. Woodham, 113 F.3d 202, 207 (11th Cir. 1997); see also  \n29 U.S.C.A. § 202(a).  The FLSA “mandates that employers pay a minimum wage to covered \nemployees . . . .”  Ross v. Wolf Fire Prot., Inc., 799 F. Supp. 2d 518, 523 (D. Md. 2011) (citing \n29 U.S.C. §§ 206(a)(1)) (emphasis added).  But not everyone who meets the technical definition \nof an employee is covered under the FLSA.  See Benshoff v. City of Virginia Beach, 180 F.3d \n  - 3 -   \n\nCase 1:18-cv-03521-RDB   Document 36-1   Filed 01/11/19   Page 4 of 18\n136, 140 (4th Cir. 1999) (holding that “the definitions of ‘employ’ and ‘employer’ were ‘not \nintended to stamp all persons as employees who, without any express or implied compensation \nagreement, might work for their own advantage on the premises of another,’ nor should they be \ninterpreted so as to ‘sweep under the Act each person who, without promise or expectation of \ncompensation, but solely for his personal purpose or pleasure, work[s] in activities carried on by \nother persons either for their pleasure or profit”) (alteration in original); see also Francis v. \nJohns, No. 5:11-CT-3005-FL, 2013 WL 1309285, at *7 (E.D. N.C. Mar. 28, 2013) (holding that \n“the FLSA’s minimum wage provisions apply only to workers who are ‘employees’ within the \nmeaning of the [FLSA]”).   \n In determining whether a claimant is a covered employee within the meaning of the \nFLSA, the Supreme Court has instructed courts to look at “the ‘economic reality’ rather than \n‘technical concepts.’”  Goldberg v. Whitaker House Co-op., Inc., 366 U.S. 28, 33 (1961).  That \ndetermination “does not depend on ‘isolated factors but rather upon the circumstances of the \nwhole activity.’”  Gionfriddo v. Jason Zink, LLC, 769 F. Supp. 2d 880, 890 (D. Md. 2011) \n(quoting Rutherford Food Corp. v. McComb, 331 U.S. 722, 730 (1947)).  “Courts generally look \nat the ‘economic reality’ of an individual’s status in the workplace before determining liability.”  \nId.  “Those seeking compensation under the [FLSA] bear the initial burden of proving that an \nemployer-employee relationship exists and that the activities in question constitute employment \nfor purposes of the [FLSA].”  Benshoff, 180 F.3d at 140. \nIn  a  custodial-detention  setting  such  as  this,  the  question  whether  an  employment \nrelationship exists turns on the economic reality of the relationship:  Can it plausibly be said that \nthe claimant is “‘employed’ in the relevant sense at all?”  Vanskike v. Peters, 974 F.2d 806, 809 \n(7th Cir. 1992).     \n  - 4 -   \n\nCase 1:18-cv-03521-RDB   Document 36-1   Filed 01/11/19   Page 5 of 18\nIn  the  prison  context,  federal  courts  have  uniformly  answered  that  question  in  the \nnegative, holding that the custodial nature of prisoner labor falls outside the type of employment \nrelationship that Congress intended the FLSA to protect.  See Loving v. Johnson, 455 F.3d 562, \n563 (5th Cir. 2006) (“We join these other circuits and hold that a prisoner doing work in or for \nthe prison is not an ‘employee’ under the FLSA and is thus not entitled to the federal minimum \nwage.”); Bennett v. Frank, 395 F.3d 409, 409 (7th Cir. 2005) (“The Fair Labor Standards Act is \nintended for the protection of employees, and  prisoners are not employees of their prison, \nwhether it is a public or a private one. So they are not protected by the Act.”); Tourscher v. \nMcCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 243 (3d Cir. 1999) (“Each circuit that has addressed the question has \nconcluded  that  prisoners  producing  goods  and  services  used  by  the  prison  should  not  be \nconsidered employees under the FLSA.”); Gambetta v. Prison Rehab. Indus.  & Diversified \nEnters., Inc., 112 F.3d 1119, 1124 (11th Cir. 1997) (“We are persuaded by the reasoning of our \nsister circuits, and we join them in the conclusion that inmates who work for state prison \nindustries are not covered by the FLSA.”); Danneskjold v. Hausrath, 82 F.3d 37, 43–44 (2d Cir. \n1996)  (holding:  “[N]o  Court  of  Appeals  has  ever  questioned  the  power  of  a  correctional \ninstitution to compel inmates to perform services for the institution without paying the minimum \nwages.  Prisoners may thus be ordered to cook, staff the library, perform janitorial services, work \nin the laundry, or carry our numerous other tasks that serve various institutional missions of the \nprison, such as recreation, care and maintenance of the facility, or rehabilitation. Such work \noccupies the prisoners’ time that might otherwise be filled by mischief; it trains prisoners in the \ndiscipline and skills of work; and it is a method of seeing that prisoners bear a cost of their \nincarceration.”; further holding “that prison labor that produces goods or services for institutional \nneeds of the prison, whether voluntary or involuntary, inside or outside the institution, or in \n  - 5 -   \n\nCase 1:18-cv-03521-RDB   Document 36-1   Filed 01/11/19   Page 6 of 18\nconnection with a private employer, is not an employment relationship within the meaning of the \nFLSA”); Abdullah v. Myers, 52 F.3d 324, *1 (6th Cir. 1995) (unpublished op.) (“Other circuits \nwhich have addressed this issue have concluded that prisoners are not employees entitled to the \nminimum  wage  because  the  prison  has  a  rehabilitative  rather  than  a  pecuniary  interest  in \nencouraging inmates to work, because the relationship is not an employment relationship but a \ncustodial one, and because the purposes of the Fair Labor Standards Act are not implicated in \nthis situation, as the prisoner does not require the minimum wage to maintain his standard of \nliving, which is provided by the state, and there is no unfair competition with employers outside \nthe prison.”); Franks v. Oklahoma State Indus., 7 F.3d 971, 973 (10th Cir. 1993) (“In our view, \nthe economic reality test was not intended to apply to work performed in the prison by a prison \ninmate.”); see also Henthorn v. Dep’t of Navy, 29 F.3d 682, 686 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (holding \nprisoner not employee of the prison); McMaster v. Minnesota, 30 F.3d 976, 980 (8th Cir. 1994) \n(same); Hale v. Arizona, 993 F.2d 1387, 1395 (9th Cir. 1993) (“[W]e are influenced by the fact \nthat no other circuit has construed the relationship between a prison and a prisoner with a hard-\ntime obligation who works on a program structured by the prison as an employment relationship \nwithin the FLSA.”). \nIn Harker v. State Use Industries, 990 F.2d 131, 136 (4th Cir. 1993), the Fourth Circuit \nagreed, noting that federal courts have uniformly held that the FLSA does not cover prisoner \nlabor “for any type of prison-operated industry or for the prison itself.”  It reasoned that the \ncustodial  relationship  differs  significantly  from  the  traditional-free  market  employment \nrelationship that Congress intended to protect: \n[Prisoners] certainly are not free to walk off the job site and look \nfor other work. When a shift ends, inmates do not leave DOC \nsupervision, but rather proceed to the next part of their regimented \nday.  [The  parties]  do  not  enjoy  the  employer-employee \n  - 6 -   \n\nCase 1:18-cv-03521-RDB   Document 36-1   Filed 01/11/19   Page 7 of 18\nrelationship  contemplated  in  the  [FLSA],  but  instead  have  a \ncustodial relationship to which the Act’s mandates do not apply. \nFurther, the FLSA does not cover these inmates because the statute \nitself  states  that  Congress  passed  minimum  wage  standards  in \norder  to  maintain  a  “standard  of  living  necessary  for  health, \nefficiency, and general well-being of workers.” 29 U.S.C. § 202(a). \nWhile incarcerated, inmates have no such needs because the DOC \nprovides them with the food, shelter, and clothing that employees \nwould have to purchase in a true employment situation. So long as \nthe DOC provides for these needs, Harker can have no credible \nclaim that inmates need a minimum wage to ensure their welfare \nand standard of living. \nId. at 133.  These reasons preclude prisoner-labor-based claims under the FLSA regardless of \nwhether  the  alleged  employer  was  a  private  or  government  entity,  or  whether  the  work \nassignment was voluntary or involuntary.  Id. at 133, 136; accord Danneskjold, 82 F.3d at 43 \n(holding that “the voluntary performance of labor that serves institutional needs of the prison is \nnot in economic reality an employment relationship. The prisoner is still a prisoner; the labor \ndoes not undermine FLSA wage structures; the opportunity is open only to prisoners; and the \nprison could order the labor if it chose. Indeed, to hold otherwise would lead to a perverse \nincentive on the part of prison officials to order the performance of labor instead of giving some \nchoice to inmates”). \nThe Fourth Circuit has thus categorically rejected FLSA claims based on all types of \nprisoner labor because applying a control-type test “in situations when an inmate works inside \nprison walls only encourages unnecessary litigation and invites confusion in an area of the law \nthat should be quite clear.”  Harker, 990 F.2d at 136.   It stated it “will not judicially impose a \nnew kind of employer-employee framework upon the DOC and its inmates under the guise of \ninterpreting the FLSA’s scope,” because, “[f]or more than fifty years, Congress has operated on \n  - 7 -   \n\nCase 1:18-cv-03521-RDB   Document 36-1   Filed 01/11/19   Page 8 of 18\nthe assumption that the FLSA does not apply to prisoner labor.  If the FLSA’s coverage is to \nextend within prison walls, Congress must say so, not the courts.” Id.2   \nCourts have since extended this rationale to reject FLSA claims brought by pretrial \ndetainees based on work-program labor, finding that the economic reality of pretrial detention \nwas not materially different than that of incarcerated prisoners.  See Villarreal, 113 F.3d at 206 \n(finding “inmate cases helpful because pretrial detainees are similar to convicted prisoners in that \nthey are incarcerated and are under the supervision and control of a governmental entity, and \nholding: “Clearly, pretrial detainees are in a custodial relationship like convicted prisoners. \nCorrectional facilities provide pretrial detainees with their everyday needs such as food, shelter, \nand clothing. Convicted prisoners are likewise provided these same basic needs. Additionally, \nlike convicted prisoners, pretrial detainees suffer from loss of freedom of choice and privacy due \nto the nature of their confinement. In light of these similarities, we deem persuasive the cases \naddressing the applicability of the FLSA to convicted inmates.”) (internal citation omitted).  \n                                                 \n2  The Fourth Circuit’s refusal to interpret the FLSA in a manner that would extend its \nprotections to cover custodial contexts because Congress never contemplated it when passing the \nAct is consistent with the Supreme Court’s refusal to literally read statutes out of context to \ncover conduct that Congress never intended the statutes to address.  See, e.g., Yates v. United \nStates, 135 S. Ct. 1074, 1081, 1087 (2015) (rejecting “an aggressive interpretation of ‘tangible \nobject’”  out  of  context  to  criminalize  a  defendant’s  destruction  of  fish,  finding  it  “highly \nimprobable that Congress would have buried a general spoliation statute covering objects of any \nand every kind in a provision targeting fraud in financial record-keeping”); see also, e.g., Bond v. \nUnited States, 572 U.S. 844, 857 (2014) (“Part of a fair reading of statutory text is recognizing \nthat  ‘Congress  legislates  against  the  backdrop’  of  certain  unexpressed  presumptions,”  and \nholding that it did not intend the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act to cover \nthe use of a toxic chemical by a jilted wife to assault her husband’s paramour).  Indeed, the \nSupreme Court’s holding that “the ‘economic reality’ rather than ‘technical concepts’ is to be the \ntest of employment,” Goldberg, 366 U.S. at 33, echoes this instruction by the Supreme Court that \ncontext matters in determining whether a particular employment relationship is covered under \nthe FLSA. \n  - 8 -   \n\nCase 1:18-cv-03521-RDB   Document 36-1   Filed 01/11/19   Page 9 of 18\nThis is because pretrial-detention labor, like prisoner labor, bears none of the indicia of \ntraditional free market employment, and imposing minimum wages in a custodial-detention \nsetting is inconsistent with the FLSA’s primary goal of protecting the standard of living and \nwell-being of workers: \nFocusing on the economic reality of the situation in its entirety, we \nconclude that [a pretrial detainee] is not an “employee” under the \nFLSA. The purpose of the FLSA is to protect the standard of living \nand  general  well-being  of  the  American  worker.  Because  the \ncorrectional  facility  meets  Villarreal’s  needs,  his  “standard  of \nliving” is protected. In sum, “the more indicia of traditional, free-\nmarket employment the relationship between the prisoner and his \nputative ‘employer’ bears, the more likely it is that the FLSA will \ngovern the employment relationship.” Villarreal’s situation does \nnot  bear  any  indicia  of  traditional  free-market  employment \ncontemplated  under  the  FLSA.  Accordingly,  we  hold  that \nVillarreal and other pretrial detainees in similar circumstances are \nnot  entitled  to  the  protection  of  the  FLSA  minimum  wage \nrequirement. \nVillareal, 113 F.3d at 207; accord Tourscher, 184 F.3d at 244 (“We agree with this rationale. \nTourscher’s employment bears no indicia of traditional free-market employment. Therefore, we \nhold that the minimum wage requirements of the FLSA do not apply to Tourscher or other \nsimilarly situated pretrial detainees.”). \nCourts have extended this logic even further and applied this version of the economic-\nreality test to reject minimum-wage claims brought by civil detainees under the FLSA, finding \nthat the distinction among prisoners, pretrial detainees, and civil detainees is immaterial.  See \nSmith v. Dart, 803 F.3d 304, 314 (7th Cir. 2015) (“We cannot see what difference it makes if the \nincarcerated  person  is  a  prisoner, civil detainee,  or  pretrial  detainee.  In  all  cases,  the \naforementioned principles apply equally.”).    \nFor instance, in Sanders v. Hayden, 544 F.3d 812, 814 (7th Cir. 2008), the court held that \nthe FLSA does not apply to labor provided by a civil detainee committed to a treatment facility, \n  - 9 -   \n\nCase 1:18-cv-03521-RDB   Document 36-1   Filed 01/11/19   Page 10 of 18\nfinding that they are not in the facility “for the purpose of enabling them to earn a living.”  The \nSeventh Circuit reasoned that Congress did not intend to impose a minimum wage in such \ncircumstances, even if the work was used to “offset some of the costs” of the detention: \nThe [facility] pays for their keep. If it puts them to work, it is to \noffset some of the cost of keeping them, or to keep them out of \nmischief, or to ease their transition to the world outside, or to equip \nthem with skills and habits that will make them less likely to return \nto crime outside. None of these goals is compatible with federal \nregulation of their wages and hours. \nId.  The First Circuit has held the same.  See Miller v. Dukakis, 961 F.2d 7, 9 (1st Cir. 1992) \n(holding the FLSA does not apply to a civil detainee committed as a sexually dangerous person). \nAnd so has the Fourth Circuit. \nIn Matherly v. Andrews, 859 F.3d 264, 278 (4th Cir. 2017), the Fourth Circuit rejected \nFLSA claims based on labor performed by civil detainees for the same reasons it categorically \nrejected FLSA claims based on prisoner labor in Harker:  “The Harker factors are applicable \nhere and compel the conclusion that [a civil detainee] doesn’t qualify as an ‘employee’ within \nthe meaning of the FLSA . . . .”  See also, e.g., Williams v. Coleman, No. 1:11-CV-01189-GBC \nPC, 2012 WL 6719483, at *3 (E.D. Cal. Dec. 26, 2012), aff’d, 536 F. App’x 694 (9th Cir. 2013) \n(“The law is clear that prisoners may be required to work and that any compensation for their \nlabor exists by grace of the state.  There is no authority to justify a digression from this well-\nestablished  law  when  the  case  involves  a  civil  detainee  rather  than  a  prisoner.”)  (internal \ncitations omitted); Shaw v. Briody, No. 2:02CV500FTM-33SPC, 2005 WL 2291711, at *3 (M.D. \nFla. Sept. 20, 2005) (finding “that FLSA is inapplicable to . . . civil detainees housed at the \nFCCC”). \nThe common thread that binds all these cases, which have unanimously rejected FLSA \nclaims based on labor performed in a prison or detention facility is the custodial nature of the \n  - 10 -   \n\nCase 1:18-cv-03521-RDB   Document 36-1   Filed 01/11/19   Page 11 of 18\nrelationship  between  the  prisoners/detainees  and  their  custodian.  That  custodial-detention \nrelationship does not bear any indicia of traditional free-market employment situations to which \nthe FLSA’s provisions apply.  Because the prisoner or detainee is removed from the national \neconomy,  because  the  work  performed  in  the  work  program  is  merely  incident  to  the \nincarceration  or  detention,  and  because  the  custodian  provides  for  their  welfare  and  basic \nstandard of living, there is no need for a minimum wage. \nCivil immigration  detainees  are  no  different.  On  remarkably  similar  facts,  the  Fifth \nCircuit has applied the same logic in the immigration-detention context.  In Alvarado Guevara v. \nI.N.S.,  902  F.2d  394,  395  (5th  Cir.  1990),  the  court  held  that  immigration  detainees  who \nperformed maintenance, cooking, laundry, and other services for $1 per day at their detention \ncenter were not covered employees under the FLSA.  Just like prisoners, pretrial detainees, and \nother  civil  detainees,  the  court  reasoned  that  immigration  detainees  were  “removed  from \nAmerican industry,” under the direct supervision and control of the detention facility, and “not \nwithin the group that Congress sought to protect in enacting the FLSA.”  Id. at 395–96. \nIn reaching this conclusion, the court further noted that Congress manifested its intent not \nto  provide  federal-minimum  wages  to  such  immigration  detainees  in  the  Immigration  and \nNaturalization Act, which authorizes “payment of allowances to aliens for work performed while \nheld in custody under the immigration laws,” id. at 396 (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1555(d), and Congress \nthen set that allowance at “a rate not in excess of $1 per day,” id. (citing Department of Justice \nAppropriation Act, Pub. L. No. 95-86, 91 Stat. 426 (1978)).  This rate was substantially less than \nthe federal minimum wage of $2.65 per hour in 1978, when the appropriations bill passed.  See \nhttps://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/chart.htm.  Having itself set an allowance for immigration-\ndetainee labor that was far below the federal minimum wage, Congress could not have intended \n  - 11 -   \n\nCase 1:18-cv-03521-RDB   Document 36-1   Filed 01/11/19   Page 12 of 18\nthe FLSA’s minimum-wage protections to cover labor performed at an immigration detention \ncenter under the work program it specifically funded. \nLikewise here, Plaintiffs’ participation in the voluntary work program at Cibola lacks any \nindicia of a free-market employment relationship.  Plaintiffs were not at Cibola to earn a living.  \nLike the immigration detainees in Alvarado, Plaintiffs were in ICE custody and detained at \nCibola  pending  their  removal  proceedings.    Plaintiffs  were  thus  completely  removed  from \nparticipating in the national economy.   \nMoreover, there was no need for Plaintiffs to earn a minimum wage at Cibola because \nCoreCivic provided their standard of living (food, shelter, healthcare, etc.).  See Sanders, 544 \nF.3d at 814.  Thus, Plaintiffs’ basic standard of living and welfare were protected regardless of \nwhether they worked.  To the extent that CoreCivic allegedly offset some of those costs through \nthe work program, that allegation does not warrant a radical departure from Harker, Matherly, \nand the plethora of other cases discussed above, which establish that the FLSA does not apply to \nsuch custodial relationships.  See Sanders, 544 F.3d at 814 (holding that Congress did not intend \nto impose a minimum wage on civil detention, even if the work was used to “offset some of the \ncosts” of the detention). \nSimply put, the economic reality of Plaintiffs’ immigration detention does not give rise to \nan employment relationship within the meaning of the FLSA.  Thus, they were not “covered \nemployees” within the meaning of the FLSA. \n  Plaintiffs’ NMMWA Claim Fails for the Same Reasons. \nThe statutory definitions of “employ,” “employer,” and “employee” under both the FLSA \nand the NMMWA (other than exceptions inapplicable here) are substantially the same.  Compare \nN.M. Stat. § 50-4-21(A), (B), and (C), with 29 U.S.C. § 203)(d), (e)(1), and (g); accord Garcia v. \nAm. Furniture Co., 689 P.2d 934, 938 (N.M. Ct. App. 1984).  Thus, courts interpreting whether \n  - 12 -   \n\nCase 1:18-cv-03521-RDB   Document 36-1   Filed 01/11/19   Page 13 of 18\nan employee is covered under the NMMWA look to federal decisions interpreting the FLSA’s \nanalogous provisions as persuasive authority.   Id.  “In determining whether a person is an \nemployee under the [NMMWA], ‘the ultimate issue is whether as a matter of “economic reality” \nthe particular worker is an employee.’” Garcia, 689 P.2d at 938 (quoting Weisel v. Singapore \nJoint Venture, Inc., 602 F.2d 1185, 1189 (5th Cir. 1979)).   \nFollowing  the  Fifth  Circuit’s  reasoning  in  Alvarado,  two  courts  have  held  that \nimmigration detainees are not covered employees under their respective state minimum-wage \nstatutes, finding that the legislative purpose of protecting the standard of living and welfare of \nworkers was not served because of the custodial setting.  See Menocal v. GEO Group., Inc., 113 \nF.  Supp.  3d  1125,  1129  (D.  Colo.  2015)  (dismissing  immigration  detainees’  claim  under \nanalogous Colorado minimum-wage statute because the facility provided for their standard of \nliving and well-being) (citing Alvarado, 902 F.2d at 396); see also Whyte v. Suffolk Cty. Sheriff’s \nDep’t, 91 Mass. App. Ct. 1124, *2 (2017) (unpublished op.), review denied, 94 N.E.3d 395 \n(Mass. 2017) (“We find no reason why Whyte’s status as a detainee should result in a different \noutcome from Federal cases. Federal cases have excluded prison labor performed within the \nprison,  because  the  primary  goals  of  the  FLSA—ensuring  a  basic  standard  of  living  and \npreventing wage structures from being undermined by unfair competition in the marketplace—\ndo not apply in that context. The rationale of the Federal cases is equally applicable to the \nMassachusetts wage laws at issue here.”). \nLikewise here, the NMMWA’s purpose is to protect the standard of living and general \nwelfare of New Mexico  workers.  See N.M.  Stat. § 50-4-19.  Plaintiffs were not covered \nemployees under the NMMWA because CoreCivic provided for Plaintiffs’ standard of living and \nwelfare.  Additionally, Plaintiffs were not detained at Cibola to earn a living.  They were \n  - 13 -   \n\nCase 1:18-cv-03521-RDB   Document 36-1   Filed 01/11/19   Page 14 of 18\nremoved from the national economy and held in custody pending the outcome of removal \nproceedings.   Plaintiffs’ state-minimum wage claim thus fails for the same reasons their federal \nclaim fails.  See, e.g., Padilla v. Am. Fed’n of State, Cty., and Mun. Emps., 11-1028 JCH/KBM, \n2013  WL  12085976,  at  *9  (D.  N.M.  March  28,  2013)  (finding  it  unnecessary  to  address \nNMMWA claim after finding that plaintiff was not a covered employee under the FLSA, noting \nthat “both parties agree that the same legal analysis applies in both case”), aff’d, 551 F. App’x \n941, 944 (10th Cir. 2014) (“We agree with the district court's analysis, and conclude, as a matter \nof law, that Padilla is not an employee for purposes of the FLSA or NMMWA.”). \n  Plaintiffs’ Unjust Enrichment Claim Should Be Dismissed. \nTo state a claim for unjust enrichment under New Mexico law, the allegations must \nestablish that (1) the defendant knowingly benefitted at the plaintiff’s expense (2) in a manner \nthat allowing the defendant to retain that benefit would be unjust.  Ontiveros Insulation Co. v. \nSanchez, 3 P.3d 695, 698–99 (N.M. App. 2000) (citing Restatement of the Law of Restitution  \n§§ 1, 40, 41 (1937)).  The mere fact that the defendant retained a benefit at the plaintiff’s \nexpense is thus insufficient—the retention of that benefit must also be unjust.  See Sunwest Bank \nof Albuquerque v. Colucci, 872 P.2d 346, 349, ¶ 12 (N.M. 1994) (citing Restatement (First) of \nRestitution § 19(c)) (“Even where a person has received a benefit from another, he is liable to \npay therefor only if the circumstances of its receipt or retention are such that, as between the two \npersons, it is unjust for him to retain it. The mere fact that a person benefits another is not of \nitself sufficient to require the other to make restitution therefor.”)).   \nHere, Plaintiffs claim that CoreCivic was unjustly enriched is based on the same incorrect \nlegal premise that it was unlawful to pay them less than the minimum wages under the FLSA and \nthe NMMWA.  Thus, this claim is merely derivative of the minimum-wage claims in Counts I \nand II, and fails because they fail.  See, e.g., Roscoe v. Fed. Home Loan Mortg. Ass’n, 201 F.3d \n  - 14 -   \n\nCase 1:18-cv-03521-RDB   Document 36-1   Filed 01/11/19   Page 15 of 18\n449, *7 (10th Cir. 1999) (unpublished op.) (“Roscoes’ unjust enrichment claim in many ways \nparallels their ‘unconscionability’ claim, and fails for the same reasons.”).   \nNevertheless, the unjust enrichment claim fails because there was no inequity between \nthe parties.  Any alleged benefit that CoreCivic received by paying Plaintiffs less than the \nminimum wage was more than offset by the fact that CoreCivic provided all of Plaintiffs’ basic \nliving expenses, including food, utilities, supplies, housing, and medical care at no cost to them.  \nSee, e.g., N.M. Stat. § 50-4-22 (B) (“An employer furnishing food, utilities, supplies, or housing \nto an employee who is engaged in agriculture may deduct the reasonable value of such furnished \nitems from any wages due to the employee.”).   \nMoreover, the unjust enrichment claim fails to the extent it is based on an implied-in-fact \nemployment contract.  In New Mexico, quasi-contract theories of restitution are not available for \nclaims “grounded in the parties’ contractual relationship.”  See Elliott Indus. Ltd. P’ship v. BP \nAm. Prod. Co., 407 F.3d 1091, 1117 (10th Cir. 2005) (The “hornbook rule [is] that quasi-\ncontractual remedies ... are not to be created when an enforceable express contract regulates the \nrelations of the parties with respect to the disputed issue.”).  In such circumstances, the parties \nare  to  “be  bound  by  the  terms  of  the  written  agreements  to  which  they  freely  commit \nthemselves.”  Id. at 1116 (quotation omitted).   \nThus, to the extent that Plaintiffs’ work-program assignments during their detention at \nCibola can give rise to an implied employment contract, their compensation is determined by \nthat agreement, and any equitable claim for more compensation is barred.  See, e.g., Hydro \nConduit Corp. v. Kemble, 793 P.2d 855, 861, ¶ 12 (N.M. 1990) (“From all of this we conclude \nthat, even though an action for unjust enrichment is not ‘based on contract’ in a strict theoretical \nsense, it is so closely related to an action which is so based that the immunity statute here, \n  - 15 -   \n\nCase 1:18-cv-03521-RDB   Document 36-1   Filed 01/11/19   Page 16 of 18\nSection 37–1–23, should be construed to extend immunity to an unjust enrichment claim as well \nas  to  a  claim  founded  on  a  true,  but  unwritten,  contract.”).    Nor  do Plaintiffs  allege  that \nCoreCivic’s payment of less than the federal or state minimum wages was the result of mistake \nor coercion.  Cf. Sunwest Bank of Albuquerque, 872 P.2d at 349 (“Where a plaintiff has paid \nmoney in the mistaken belief that an enforceable contract exists, the plaintiff is entitled to \nrecover the money paid, as restitution.”).  Thus, the value of any labor that CoreCivic allegedly \nretained  through  the  work  program,  above  the  compensation  Plaintiffs  already  received \n(including free living expenses), was an officious benefit to which Plaintiffs have no right to \nrestitution.  See Restatement (First) of Restitution § 112 (“[T]he principle that a person who \nofficiously confers a benefit upon another is not entitled to restitution therefor.”).  As a matter of \nlaw, there is no unjust enrichment. \nIII.

The district court dismissed the case on the \ngrounds that this circuit and others have declined to extend the FLSA to custodial settings.  \nFor the reasons that follow, we think that task is best left to Congress and thus affirm.  \nI.   \n  In  2017,  appellants  were  detained  for  several  months  at  the  Cibola  County \nCorrectional Center (Cibola) in Milan, New Mexico, which houses detainees “while their \nimmigration cases are processed . . . to ensure their presence during the administrative \nprocess and, if necessary, to ensure their availability for removal from the United States.”  \nJ.A. 10.  Cibola is operated pursuant to a series of agreements among Cibola County, New \nMexico, the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement \n(ICE), and appellee CoreCivic, Inc.  According to its 2016 Intergovernmental Service \nAgreement (IGSA) with ICE, Cibola County is authorized to “detain immigrants on behalf \nof ICE.”  J.A. 9.  Cibola County, in turn, entered into a service agreement with CoreCivic, \nauthorizing the for-profit private company “to serve as Cibola’s independent contractor for \nthe care and safety of civilly detained immigrants.”  Id.  \nUnder its service agreement with the county, CoreCivic is bound by the terms of the \nIGSA  between  Cibola  County  and  ICE.    This  includes  providing  detainees  with \n“safekeeping, housing, subsistence, medical and other services.”  J.A. 118.  The contract \nalso requires CoreCivic to operate Cibola in accordance with ICE’s Performance-Based \n3 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 19-2207      Doc: 45            Filed: 03/05/2021      Pg: 4 of 13\nNational Detention Standards (PBNDS).  These standards mandate that CoreCivic offer \nand  manage  a  Voluntary  Work  Program  (VWP)  for  detainees.    The  VWP  aims  to \n“reduce[]” the “negative impact of confinement . . . through decreased idleness, improved \nmorale and fewer disciplinary incidents,” while also providing detainees “opportunities to \nwork  and  earn  money  while  confined,  subject  to  the  number  of  work  opportunities \navailable and within the constraints of the safety, security and good order of the facility.”  \nJ.A. 155.  As its name suggests, the program is voluntary, although selection and continued \nparticipation depend on a detainee’s classification level, attitude, and behavior.  Work \nassignments include “preparing and serving meals, cleaning the facilities, performing other \njanitorial tasks, performing laundry services, and operating the library and the barber \nshop.”  J.A. 6.  CoreCivic sometimes hires community members of Cibola County to \nperform the same or similar work.  Detainees are not permitted to “work in excess of 8 \nhours daily, 40 hours weekly.”  J.A. 157.  \nAppellants participated in Cibola’s VWP by working as janitors and in the library \nand kitchen.  For this work, they were compensated between $1.00 a day and $15.00 a \nweek, which is markedly below the federally- and state-mandated minimum wages for \ncovered employees but satisfies the pay required by the VWP standards.  See J.A. 13–17.  \nAppellants further allege that because CoreCivic failed to provide them “with adequate \nfacilities and basic necessities,” they “used their wages to purchase items, such as phone \ncalls, food, and toiletries, that met their basic needs.”  J.A. 12.  In particular, a 2018 \ninspection by ICE’s Office of Detention Oversight found three deficiencies in regards to \nfood; these related to the temperature of food, a delivery cart that was left unsupervised, \n4 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 19-2207      Doc: 45            Filed: 03/05/2021      Pg: 5 of 13\nand the use of gloves and hair nets by food delivery workers.  J.A. 172–73.  The facility \ntook appropriate corrective actions before the inspection was completed.  \nAfter  their  release,  appellants  filed  this  suit  in  November  2018  on  behalf  of \nthemselves and others similarly situated, alleging that CoreCivic violated the Fair Labor \nStandards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. §§ 201, et seq., New Mexico Minimum Wage Act \n(NMMWA), N.M. Stat. Ann. §§ 50-4-19, et seq., and the common law doctrine of unjust \nenrichment by paying civilly detained immigrant workers less than federal and state-\nmandated minimum wages.  CoreCivic filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim \npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) in January 2019, which the district \ncourt granted in September 2019.   \nThe district court relied upon this court’s decision in Harker v. State Use Industries, \n990 F.2d 131, 133 (4th Cir. 1993), which held that a prison inmate was not covered by \nFLSA for his work in the prison’s graphic print shop because the custodial context differs \nsubstantially from the traditional free labor market.  J.A. 179.  It also found the Fifth \nCircuit’s decision in Alvarado Guevara v. I.N.S., 902 F.2d 394, 396 (5th Cir. 1990),  \npersuasive, which held the FLSA inapplicable to work performed by alien detainees \nbecause they were “removed from American industry” while detained.  Id.  The trial court \nthus concluded that appellants were not “employees” as contemplated by the FLSA or \nNMMWA and were therefore not entitled to federal or state-mandated minimum wages.  \nId.  “The economic reality of the Plaintiffs’ situation,” the court noted, “is almost identical \nto a prison inmate and does not share commonality with that of a traditional employer-\n5 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 19-2207      Doc: 45            Filed: 03/05/2021      Pg: 6 of 13\nemployee relationship.”  Id.  The court then dismissed appellants’ unjust enrichment claim \nas contingent on the success of their FLSA claim.  J.A. 179–80.  \nWe review a district court’s grant of a motion to dismiss de novo.  Harbourt v. PPE \nCasino Resorts Md., LLC, 820 F.3d 655, 658 (4th Cir. 2016). To survive a motion to \ndismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint must contain “sufficient factual matter, accepted \nas true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. \n662, 678 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted); Harbourt, 820 F.3d at 658.  \nII. \n  Appellants argue that they are owed wages under the minimum wage provisions of \nthe  FLSA  and  NMMWA  for  work  performed  while  they  were  detained  for  civil \nimmigration proceedings because they were “employees” under those acts.  But such a \nclaim is clearly foreclosed by this circuit’s precedent and the well-established principles \ngoverning the interpretation of the FLSA.1    \nA. \nThe FLSA requires an “employer” to pay an “employee” no less than the federal \nminimum wage.  29 U.S.C. § 206(a).  As has been noted, the Act’s “circular” definition of \n“employee”—“any  individual  employed  by an  employer,”  29  U.S.C.  §  203(e)(1)—is \nunhelpful.  Harker, 990 F.2d at 133; see also Henthorn v. Dep’t of Navy, 29 F.3d 682, 684 \n(D.C. Cir. 1994).  The Act further defines “employer” as “any person acting . . . in the \n \n1 The parties agree that the NMMWA should be interpreted in accordance with the \nFLSA and that the appellants’ unjust enrichment claim depends on the success of their \nFLSA claim.  Thus, our discussion is limited to interpreting the FLSA.  \n6 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 19-2207      Doc: 45            Filed: 03/05/2021      Pg: 7 of 13\ninterest of an employer in relation to an employee,” id. § 203(d), and “employ” as “to suffer \nor permit to work,” id. § 203(g).  It then exempts a host of positions, including “criminal \ninvestigator”  and  “casual”  babysitter,  from  the  Act’s  minimum  wage  and  hour \nrequirements.  Id. § 213(a).   \nAppellants  claim  that  because  civil  immigration  detainees  are  not  expressly \nexempted  from  the  FLSA’s  coverage,  they  must  be  subject  to  its  minimum  wage \nprovisions.  But this argument puts the cart before the horse.  An individual must first be \nan “employee” for purposes of the FLSA before his or her position may be exempted from \nthe Act’s provisions.  Harker, 990 F.2d at 133 (noting that this argument “presupposes that \ninmates in SUI-type programs should be considered employees for FLSA purposes in the \nfirst place”); Bennett v. Frank, 395 F.3d 409, 410 (7th Cir. 2005) (“The reason the FLSA \ncontains no express exception for prisoners is probably that the idea was too outlandish to \noccur to anyone when the legislation was under consideration by Congress.”).  Thus the \nsole question here is whether appellants are “employees.”  Finding the Act’s definitions \nonly so useful in advancing their analyses, courts have instead turned to the FLSA’s \nlegislative purpose for guidance.  See, e.g., Bennett, 395 F.3d at 409.  \nThe FLSA was enacted to protect workers who operate within “the traditional \nemployment paradigm.”  Harker, 990 F.2d at 133.  Persons in custodial detention—such \nas appellants—are not in an employer-employee relationship but in a detainer-detainee \nrelationship that falls outside that paradigm.  There are many crucial differences between \nthese two relationships.  In the latter relationship, individuals are under the control and \nsupervision of the detention facility, which is simply not comparable to the “free labor \n7 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 19-2207      Doc: 45            Filed: 03/05/2021      Pg: 8 of 13\nsituation of true employment.”  Id.  Those in custodial detention, unlike workers in a free \nlabor market, “certainly are not free to walk off the job site and look for other work.”  Id.; \nsee also id. (“When a shift ends, inmates do not leave DOC supervision, but rather proceed \nto the next part of their regimented day.”); Gilbreath v. Cutter Biological, Inc., 931 F.2d \n1320, 1325 (9th Cir. 1991).  Put simply, “there is too much control to classify the [detainer-\ndetainee] relationship as one of employment.”  Vanskike v. Peters, 974 F.2d 806, 810 (7th \nCir. 1992).  \nIt is for that reason that the mere voluntariness of participating in a work program \nor the transfer of money between a detainee and detainer does not manufacture a bargained-\nfor exchange of labor.  There is an “exchange” in the normal sense of the word when money \nmoves from CoreCivic’s pockets to those  of the detainees,  but  that exchange is  not \n“bargained-for.”  Those in custodial detention “do not deal at arms’ length.”  Harker, 990 \nF.2d at 133; see also Alvarado Guevara, 902 F.2d at 396.  While a detainee may choose \nwhether or not to participate in a voluntary work program, they have that opportunity \n“solely at the prerogative” of the custodian.  Harker, 990 F.2d at 133; see also Morgan v. \nMacDonald, 41 F.3d 1291, 1293 (9th Cir. 1994) (“[The inmate] was in no sense free to \nbargain with would-be employers for the sale of his labor; his work at the prison was merely \nan incident of his incarceration.”).  Such is the case here with the detainees’ participation \nin the VWP.  \nMoreover, unlike workers in a free labor market who use their wages to maintain \ntheir “standard of living” and “general well-being,” 29 U.S.C. § 202(a), detainees in a \ncustodial institution are entitled to the provision of food, shelter, medicine, and other \n8 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 19-2207      Doc: 45            Filed: 03/05/2021      Pg: 9 of 13\nnecessities.  See Harker, 990 F.2d at 133; Vanskike, 974 F.2d at 810–11; Miller v. Dukakis, \n961 F.2d 7, 9 (1st Cir. 1992).  Like the inmates in Harker, CoreCivic is both morally and \nlegally bound to meet detainees’ basic needs, further undermining appellants’ claim that \nthe FLSA is applicable.  In an effort to blunt this point, appellants contest the adequacy of \nthe food and other necessities that CoreCivic is contractually obligated to provide.  But any \npotential inadequacy of conditions is not appropriately remedied by applying the FLSA \nwholesale  to  detainees.   As  the  Seventh  Circuit  noted,  it  “is  the  jail's  constitutional \nobligation to provide [a detainee] with his basic needs, including adequate food and \ndrinkable water.  When the jail fails to do so, it is that failure that must be remedied (the \nConstitution demands it); it does not entitle him to receive minimum wage under the \nFLSA.”  Smith v. Dart, 803 F.3d 304, 314 (7th Cir. 2015).  Such a conclusion makes good \nsense.  Hinging the FLSA’s application on the adequacy of mandated conditions would \nlead to prolonged litigative uncertainty and leave everyone in limbo.   \nB. \n  Appellants attempt to characterize Harker as simply a case about criminal detention. \nBut our more recent decision in Matherly v. Andrews reaffirmed the principles of Harker \nand foreclosed this contention.  859 F.3d 264 (4th Cir. 2017).  In Matherly, this court \nrejected the civilly detained plaintiff’s request for the federal minimum wage.  The claim \nran “head first into our FLSA jurisprudence” because: (1) the purpose of the program was \nnot to turn a profit; (2) Matherly’s “employment relationship with the BOP [wasn’t] the \nproduct of a bargained-for exchange”; and (3) the prison provided detainees with food, \nshelter, and clothing, “satisfying the underlying purpose of the FLSA’s minimum wage \n9 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 19-2207      Doc: 45            Filed: 03/05/2021      Pg: 10 of 13\nprovision.”  Id. at 278 (citing Harker, 990 F.2d at 133).  Thus, the civil nature of appellants’ \ndetainment is not dispositive.    \nOur circuit is hardly alone in refusing to expand the Act to custodial detentions.  \nEach circuit to address the issue—whether the litigants sought FLSA application for \ninmates,  or  pretrial  detainees,  or  civil  detainees—has  concluded  that  the  FLSA’s \nprotections do not extend to the custodial context generally.  See, e.g., Loving v. Johnson, \n455 F.3d 562, 563 (5th Cir. 2006) (inmate labor); Bennett v. Frank, 395 F.3d 409, 409 (7th \nCir. 2005) (same); Gambetta v. Prison Rehab. Indus. & Diversified Enters., Inc., 112 F.3d \n1119, 1124 (11th Cir. 1997) (same); Danneskjold v. Hausrath, 82 F.3d 37, 43–44 (2d Cir. \n1996) (same); Abdullah v. Myers, 52 F.3d 324, at *1 (6th Cir. 1995) (same); McMaster v. \nMinnesota, 30 F.3d 976, 980 (8th Cir. 1994) (same); Henthorn v. Dep’t of Navy, 29 F.3d \n682, 686–87 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (same); Franks v. Okla. State Indus., 7 F.3d 971, 973 (10th \nCir. 1993) (same); Gilbreath v. Cutter Biological, Inc., 931 F.2d 1320, 1325 (9th Cir. 1991) \n(same); see also Smith v. Dart, 803 F.3d 304, 314 (7th Cir. 2015) (pre-trial detainee labor); \nTourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 243–44 (3d Cir. 1999) (same); Villarreal v. \nWoodham, 113 F.3d 202, 206–07 (11th Cir. 1997) (same); see also Sanders v. Hayden, 544 \nF.3d 812, 814 (7th Cir. 2008) (civil detainee labor); Miller v. Dukakis, 961 F.2d 7, 9 (1st \nCir. 1992) (same); Williams v. Coleman, 536 F. App’x 694 (9th Cir. 2013) (same). \n  Such a weight of authority is not easily dismissed.  Failing in their distinction \nbetween criminal and civil detainment, appellants highlight that they are being detained for \nimmigration  purposes,  noting  that  “[c]ivil  immigration  detention  is  not  punitive  or \ncorrective.”  J.A. 10.  But the fact that appellants are being held specifically for immigration \n10 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 19-2207      Doc: 45            Filed: 03/05/2021      Pg: 11 of 13\npurposes does not alter our analysis.  Neither Harker nor Matherly turned on the reason for \nthe  custodial  detention  but  rather  the  fact  of  it.    Appellants  are  detained  pending \nadministrative immigration proceedings and cannot leave the facility without authorization \nfrom ICE.  As explained above, the custodial detention context is inconsistent with the free \nlabor market envisioned by the FLSA, and the amassed authority of our sister circuits \ndemonstrates that logic applies to institutional confinements generally.  See, e.g., Miller, \n961 F.2d at 9 (civil detainee); Villarreal, 113 F.3d at 206 (pretrial detainee).    \nIndeed, to find that detention for immigration purposes could render a detainee an \n“employee” for purposes of the FLSA would create a split with the Fifth Circuit, which has \naddressed this issue head-on.  See Alvarado Guevara v. I.N.S., 902 F.2d 394 (5th Cir. 1990) \n(per curiam).  Considering the Act’s purpose, the Fifth Circuit found that “current and \nformer alien detainees of the INS whom Defendants employed in grounds maintenance, \ncooking, laundry and other services at the rate of one dollar ($1.00) per day” were not \n“employees” for purposes of the FLSA.  Id. at 395–96.  Thus, to hold with appellants would \nrequire us to not only contravene our own precedent but would also create a conflict in a \ncontext where uniformity is favored.   \nAppellants argue finally that the FLSA’s aim of combatting unfair competition in \nthe marketplace is implicated because the detention facility happens to be operated by a \nfor-profit, private entity.  See 29 U.S.C. § 202(a).  But whatever merit this observation \npossesses as a matter of policy cannot dictate its adoption as a proposition of law.  Other \ncircuits have held that the nonemployee-status of detainees is not altered by the private, \nfor-profit nature of the detention facility.  See, e.g., Bennett, 395 F.3d at 409 (“The Fair \n11 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 19-2207      Doc: 45            Filed: 03/05/2021      Pg: 12 of 13\nLabor Standards Act is intended for the protection of employees, and prisoners are not \nemployees of their prison, whether it is a public or a private one.”).  While detentions may \nwell have an incidental monetary aspect, their aims are not primarily economic ones.  “The \npurpose of [appellants’] detention is to ensure their presence during the administrative \nprocess and, if necessary, to ensure their availability for removal from the United States.”  \nJ.A. 10 (Appellants’ Class Action Complaint).  The fact that CoreCivic would have to hire \nnondetainees for such work without detainees’ participation does not eliminate the non-\npecuniary goals of the VWP.  As with the work programs in Harker and Matherly, the \nVWP’s aim of reducing the “negative impact of confinement . . . through decreased \nidleness, improved morale and fewer disciplinary incidents” remains intact.  J.A. 155 \n(Voluntary Work Program pamphlet); see also Abdullah, 52 F.3d at *1 (“The fact that the \nprison in which Abdullah is incarcerated is managed by a private contractor does not render \nthe interest served by providing work for the inmates into a pecuniary rather than a \nrehabilitative one.  Under either scenario [whether the institution is public or private], \nservices not performed by prisoners would have to be obtained at a greater expense.”).  \nOur point is emphatically not one of advocacy for any method of detention or \ncustody.  It is simply not within this court’s authority to amend statutes from the bench.  \nThe FLSA was a congressional creation, and its expansion is a matter for Congress as well.  \nWhat appellants propose is a fundamental alteration of what it means to be an “employee.”  \nAppellants are not employees in the free labor market contemplation of the Act, and we \nare powerless to make them so.  If Congress wishes to apply the FLSA to custodial \ndetentions, it is certainly free to do so.  But the corollary is that courts are not.   \n12 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 19-2207      Doc: 45            Filed: 03/05/2021      Pg: 13 of 13\nIII. \nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment.  \nAFFIRMED \n \n \n \n \n13 \n ",

Plaintiffs Desmond Ndambi, Mbah Emmanuel Abi, and Nkemtoh Moses \nA wombang (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, \nby and through their undersigned attorneys, bring this action against Defendant CoreCivic, Inc. \n(\"Defendant\" or \"CoreCivic\") for failing to pay immigrants confined in civil detention at the \nCibola County Correctional Center (\"Cibola\") their legally mandated wages as required by the \nFair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\") and the New Mexico Minimum Wage Act (''NMMW A\"). \n\nCase 1:18-cv-03521-RDB   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 2 of 26\nPlaintiffs also bring this action, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, against \nCoreCivic for unjust enrichment under New Mexico common law because it failed to pay \nPlaintiffs a fair and adequate wage, yet it received the value of their labor and retained the \ndifference between the inadequate pay and the prevailing wage in Cibola County. \n2.  CoreCivic is among the oldest and largest for-profit corrections corporations in \nthe United States.  In 2017, CoreCivic reported $1.84 billion in revenue, with 48% from \ncontracts with federal government agencies.  CoreCivic owns and operates Cibola, a prison \ncomplex that has faced several recent scandals for mistreatment and inadequate care of prisoners \nand civilly detained immigrants.  CoreCivic profits from its operation ofCibola by relying \nheavily on a captive workforce of civilly detained immigrants, including Plaintiffs, to perform \nlabor necessary to keep Cibola operational and provide the services it is obligated to provide \nunder the terms of its contract with Cibola County, New Mexico.  The work includes tasks such \nas preparing and serving meals, cleaning the facilities, performing other janitorial tasks, \nperforming laundry services, and operating the library and the barber shop.  CoreCivic \nsometimes hires non-detainees who live in the surrounding community to perform the same \nwork.  If Plaintiffs did not perform this work, CoreCivic would have to hire more people from \nthe surrounding community to keep Cibola operational and pay those additional workers the \nlegally mandated wages, which would be substantially higher than the wages actually paid to \nPlaintiffs. \n3.  Despite the importance and necessity of Plaintiffs' work to CoreCivic's business, \nCoreCivic has always paid them less than the legally required wage for their work, and \nsometimes as little as one dollar per day.  CoreCivic has contracted with Cibola County to \noperate a detention facility that holds civilly detained immigrants and to pay workers the \n2 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-03521-RDB   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 3 of 26\nprevailing wage in the community to operate the facility.  By suffering or permitting Plaintiffs to \nperform work at its facility and for its benefit while paying Plaintiffs well below the minimum \nwage and the prevailing wage in Cibola County, CoreCivic violates its service contract with the \nCounty and suppresses wages in the local labor market.  CoreCivic's labor practices at Cibola \nrender the company liable under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the New Mexico Minimum Wage \nAct, and the common law doctrine of unjust enrichment. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n4.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331  because \nthis action arises under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 29 U.S.C. § 20 I, el seq. \n5.  Independently, the Court has original jurisdiction pursuant to the Class Action \nFairness Act of2005 (\"CAF A\"), 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d), because at least one class member is of \ndiverse citizenship from Defendant CoreCivic, there are more than I 00 class members, and the \naggregate amount in controversy exceeds $5,000,000. \n6.  Additionally, the Court has supplemental jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1367 over Plaintiffs' pendent state law claims under the New Mexico Minimum Wage Act and \nunjust enrichment under New Mexico common law. \n7.  This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendant pursuant to Md. Code Ann. \n§ 6-102 because Defendant is organized under the laws of Maryland. \n8.  Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391 (b)(2) and Md. Code \nAnn. § 6-102 because Defendant is organized under the laws of Maryland and therefore resides \nin this District. \n3 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-03521-RDB   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 4 of 26\nPARTIES \nPlaintiffs \n9.  Plaintiff Desmond Ndambi is an adult resident ofNew Carrollton, Maryland.  Mr. \nNdambi has tiled a consent to join this action. See Exh. I. \nI 0.  Mr. Ndambi was an employee of CoreCivic, as that term is defined by the FLSA, \n29 U.S.C. § 203(e)(l) and (g), and the NMMWA, NM Stat. Ann. § 50-4-21. Mr. Ndambi \nworked for CoreCivic while detained at Cibola from approximately June to October 2017. \nII.  PlaintiffMbah Emmanuel Abi is an adult resident of Brunswick, Ohio.  Mr. Abi \nhas filed a consent to join this action.  See Exh. 2. \n12.  Mr. Abi was an employee ofCoreCivic, as that term is defined by the FLSA, 29 \nU.S.C. § 203(e)( I) and (g), and the NMMWA, NM Stat. Ann. § 50-4-21. Mr. Abi worked for \nCoreCivic while detained at Cibola from approximately June to November 2017. \n13.  PlaintiffNkemtoh Moses Awombang is an adult resident of Cleveland, Ohio.  Mr. \nAwombang has tiled a consent to join this action.  See Exh. 3. \n14.  Mr. Awombang was an employee ofCoreCivic, as that term is defined by the \nFLSA, 29 U.S.C. § 203(e)( I) and (g), and the NMMWA, NM Stat. Ann. § 50-4-21.  Mr. \nAwombang worked for CoreCivic while detained at Cibola from approximately June to \nDecember 20 17. \nDefendant \n15.  Defendant CoreCivic, Inc., (\"CoreCivic\" or \"Defendant\") formerly Corrections \nCorporation of America, 1 is a real estate investment trust.  CoreCivic is organized under the laws \n1 In late 2016, the company announced it was changing its name to CoreCivic from Corrections Corporation of \nAmerica.  It did not otherwise change its legal identity. As a result, this complaint uses the names CoreCivic and \nCorrections Corporation of America interchangeably. \n4 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-03521-RDB   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 5 of 26\nof Maryland with its principal place of business at I 0 Burton Hills Boulevard, Nashville, \nTennessee 37215.  CoreCivic has a registered agent, The Corporation Trust, Inc., located at 2405 \nYork Road, Suite 20 I Lutherville Timonium, Maryland 21093. \n16.  At all relevant times, CoreCivic owned and operated the Cibola County \nCorrectional Center (\"Cibola\") located at 2000 Cibola Loop, Milan, NM 87021, pursuant to the \npurported authority of a private service contract with Cibola County, New Mexico. \n17.  At all relevant times, Cibola County, New Mexico maintained an \nIntergovernmental Service Agreement (\"IGSA\") with U.S. Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement (\"ICE\") to detain immigrants on behalf ofiCE. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS RELATED TO ALL CLAIMS \n18.  CoreCivic is the second-largest private prison and detention corporation in the \nUnited States, with a market capitalization of nearly $3 billion.  lt recently estimated that it owns \n58% of all prison beds and manages 41% of all private prison beds in the United States. \nCoreCivic's contracts with ICE to civilly detain immigrants with pending removal proceedings \ncurrently account for at least 30% of its annual revenues. \n19.  CoreCivic owns and operates Cibola, which is a civil immigration detention \ncenter and prison complex.  In 2016, Cibola County entered into an !GSA with ICE to maintain \ncustody of civilly detained immigrants.  Cibola County, in tum, entered into a service contract \nwith CoreCivic in which CoreCivic agreed to serve as Cibola's independent contractor for the \ncare and safety of civilly detained immigrants and to operalc Cibola in compliance with the \nterms of the !GSA between ICE and Cibola County. \n20.  As an independent contractor and service provider to Cibola County, CoreCivic \ndrafted and supplied Cibola's staffing plan in response to a Performance Work Statement issued \n5 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-03521-RDB   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 6 of 26\nby TCE.  CoreCivic determined the number, tasks, and pay rate of detained immigrants who \nwould perform work. \n21.  Civilly detained immigrants are individuals held in civil detention while their \nimmigration cases are processed.  Such individuals are \"administrative detainees,\" as they have \nnot been charged with any criminal violation.  The purpose of their detention is to ensure their \npresence during the administrative process and, if necessary, to ensure their availability for \nremoval from the United States.  While some civilly detained immigrants are removed from the \nUnited States after their detention, many such individuals are released from detention with \npermission to reside and work in the United States legally.  Civil immigration detention is not \npunitive or corrective, it does not reflect a determination that detained immigrants have violated \nany laws of the United States, and it does not determine the outcome of their immigration cases. \nBy law, civil detainees are the sole owners of the labor they provide. \n22.  Plaintiffs and those similarly situated are civilly detained immigrants previously \nor currently detained at Cibola. \n23.  Under the IGSA, Cibola County agreed to provide or procure services necessary \nto civilly detain immigrants.  The ISGA incorporates into its terms the Service Contract Act, 41 \nU.S.C. § 351 et seq., thereby requiring, inter alia, that any employees providing services under \nthe contract must be paid the prevailing wages and benefits in the locality where they are \nproviding such services.  The TGSA requires Cibola County to provide or procure all services at \nCibola in compliance with \"all applicable federal, state, and local laws and standards.\"  If a \nconflict exists between any of these laws, regulations, or standards, the TGSA provides that \"the \nmost stringent standard shall apply.\" \n6 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-03521-RDB   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 7 of 26\n24.  CoreCivic contracted with Cibola County to provide services necessary to civilly \ndetain immigrants in compliance with the terms of the IGSA, and to hire and pay workers the \nprevailing wage in the community and in compliance with the state and federal minimum wage \nrequirements.  In contrast to its contract, CoreCivic has failed to provide the civilly detained \nimmigrants with basic necessities. CoreCivic does not have the discretion to employ civilly \ndetained immigrants to perform services necessary to operate Cibola and to pay them an amount \nless than the legally required wage for their work, which is sometimes as little as one dollar per \nday. \n25.  Cibola has the capacity to hold up to I, 116 civilly detained immigrants per day. \nThe number of such immigrants in custody at Cibola at any given time from January 2017 to the \npresent exceeded I 00 persons and, at times, has exceeded 800 persons. \n26.  CoreCivic operates and maintains a work program at Cibola, pursuant to which it \nhas suffered or permitted Plaintiffs and those similarly situated to perform work that benefits \nCoreCivic.  Such work provides services necessary to keep Cibola operational, including \npreparing and serving meals, cleaning the facilities and performing other janitorial tasks, \nperforming laundry services, and operating the library and the barber shop. These services \nbenefit CoreCivic because they are integral to Cibola's operation and the company's profitable \nperformance of its service contract with Cibola County.  They are, therefore, essential to \nCoreCivic's fulfilment of its obligations under its contract with Cibola County. \n27.  Plaintiffs and those similarly situated were CoreCivic employees under the FLSA \nand the NMMW A.  CoreCivic supplied daily supervision over civilly detained immigrants who \nparticipated in the work program, including, but not limited to, creating and continuously \n7 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-03521-RDB   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 8 of 26\nrevising a facility staffing plan that accounts for the positions, hours, and pay of all detained \nimmigrants who participate. \n28.  CoreCivic paid the Plaintiffs and those similarly situated at a rate of pay that was \nless than the legally required wage and sometimes as little as one dollar per day.  On some \noccasions, Plaintiffs and those similarly situated were not paid at all for their work.  In all cases, \nPlaintiffs and those similarly situated were paid Jess than the minimum wage required by the \nFLSA and NMMW A and less than the prevailing wage for Cibola County. \n29.  In violation of the provisions of the !GSA, CoreCivic has failed to follow federal \nand state laws when compensating civilly detained immigrants for work they perform. \n30.  CoreCivic has failed to provide Plaintiffs and those similarly situated with \nadequate facilities and basic necessities, despite its use of their labor to maintain and operate \nCibola. For example, CoreCivic often served insufficient amounts of food, at unsafe \ntemperatures, and/or without hygienic food-handling safeguards. CoreCivic also failed to \nprovide adequate access to telephones and legal materials. \n31.  Plaintiffs and those similarly situated used their wages to purchase items, such as \nphone calls, food, and toiletries, that met their basic needs.  CoreCivic deducted the expense of \nsuch items from the accounts ofPlaintiffs and those similarly situated. \n32.  CoreCivic failed to operate Cibola in compliance with the relevant contractual \nrequirements.  For instance, a January 2018 inspection by ICE's Office of Detention Oversight \nfound the facility to be deficient in no fewer than 31 contractually imposed standards. \n8 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-03521-RDB   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 9 of 26\nPlaintiffDesmond Ndambi \n33.  Mr. Ndambi was detained at Cibola from approximately June 22, 2017, to \napproximately October I, 2017.  He remained in civil immigration detention at Cibola while his \nimmigration case was processed. \n34.  Shortly after arriving at Cibola, Mr. Ndambi began working as a janitor at the \nfacility.  He worked in this capacity for approximately one to three hours per day, seven days per \nweek.  CoreCivic knew that Mr. Ndambi was performing this work and permitted him to do so. \nGuards, who were CoreCivic employees, supervised his work, and CoreCivic provided the \ncleaning supplies and tools necessary for Mr. Ndambi to perform the work.  CoreCivic benefitted \nfrom Mr. Ndambi's cleaning work because it was necessary to maintain the facility at a profit. \nCoreCivic paid Mr. Ndambi only one dollar per day for his cleaning work. \n35.  Around late July 2017, Mr. Ndambi was selected to work in Cibola's library. \n36.  For the last approximately two months of his detention, Mr. Ndambi worked in \nthe library approximately eight hours per day, five days per week.  CoreCivic controlled Mr. \nNdambi's work hours through its staffing plan. \n37.  CoreCivic knew of Mr. Ndambi's library work and permitted it.  A CoreCivic \nemployee told him when to work and escorted him to and from his shift at the library.  Another \nemployee who lived in the community and was not confined in Cibola supervised Mr. Ndambi's \nwork, assigned him tasks, and worked alongside him.  Guards, who were CoreCivic employees, \nalso supervised Mr. Ndambi's work.  CoreCivic provided the library facility and tools necessary \nfor Mr. Ndambi to perform the work. \n38.  CoreCivic usually paid Mr. Ndambi one dollar per day for his work in the library, \nwithout regard to the number of hours worked. Thus, for the approximately 40 hours per week \n9 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-03521-RDB   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 10 of 26\nhe worked in the library, CoreCivic paid Mr. Ndambi $0.125 per hour.  On several occasions, \nhowever, CoreCivic failed to pay him at all for his work. \n39.  Mr. Ndambi'sjanitorial and library work benefitted CoreCivic by allowing it to \nconform to its service contract at the Cibola facility.  Because it employed Mr. Ndambi, \nCoreCivic did not need to employ someone else (who would have been paid at rates compliant \nwith the FLSA, the NMMWA, and the Service Contract Act) to perform the tasks that Mr. \nNdambi performed. \n40.  Mr. Ndambi used his wages to purchase basic necessities while in detention. \nCoreCivic deducted the cost of such necessities from Mr. Ndambi's account.  When he was \nreleased, CoreCivic paid Mr. Ndambi the funds remaining in his account. \nPlaintiff Mbah Emmanuel Abi \n41.  Mr. Abi was detained at Cibola beginning approximately June 24, 2017, to \napproximately November 22, 2017.  He remained in civil immigration detention at Cibola while \nhis immigration case was processed. \n42.  Mr. Abi began working as a janitor at Cibola beginning in July 2017.  He \nperformed tasks such as cleaning the floors and toilets at the facility.  Mr. Abi worked in the \nposition approximately two hours per day, seven days per week. CoreCivic knew of Mr. Abi's \nwork as a janitor and permitted it.  He filled out a time sheet provided by CoreCivic that \nindicated how many hours he worked.  Guards, who were CoreCivic employees, supervised his \nwork, and CoreCivic provided the cleaning supplies and tools necessary for Mr. Abi to perform \nhis work.  Mr. Abi performed work that benefitted CoreCivic because it was necessary to \nmaintain the facility at a profit.  CoreCivic paid Mr. Abi one dollar per day for his janitorial \nwork. \n10 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-03521-RDB   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 11 of 26\n43.  In August 2017, Mr. Abi filled out an application to begin working in the kitchen \nat Cibola.  CoreCivic hired him and, through its staffing plan, assigned him to work at least six \nhours per day, at least five days per week.  Mr. Abi signed a time sheet indicating how many \nhours he worked. \n44.  Mr. Abi prepared and served meals to civilly detained immigrants like himself \nand CoreCivic employees. \n45.  CoreCivic knew of Mr. Abi's work in the kitchen and permitted it.  Guards, who \nwere CoreCivic employees, supervised Mr. Abi's work.  Further, CoreCivic provided the tools \nand facilities necessary for Mr. Abi to perform his work. \n46.  Mr. Abi's work benefitted CoreCivic because it was necessary to keep the facility \noperational and profitable, as CoreCivic did not employ or subcontract enough people who were \nnot detained to run the kitchen without them.  Because it employed Mr. Abi, CoreCivic did not \nneed to employ someone else (who would have been paid at rates compliant with the FLSA, the \nNMMW A, and the Service Contract Act) to perform the tasks that Mr. Abi performed. \n47.  CoreCivic paid Mr. Abi $15 per week for worldng in the ldtchen, without regard \nto the number of hours worked.  Because he worked at least six hours per day, at least five days \nper week, CoreCivic paid Mr. Abi $0.50 or less per hour. \n48.  Mr. Abi used his wages to purchase basic necessities while in detention. \nCoreCivic deducted the cost of such necessities from Mr. Abi's account.  When he was released, \nCoreCivic paid Mr. Abi funds remaining in his account. \nII \n\nCase 1:18-cv-03521-RDB   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 12 of 26\nPlaintiffNkemtoh Moses Awombang \n49.  Mr. Awombang was detained at Cibola beginning approximately June 20, 2017, \nuntil approximately December 20, 2017.  He remained in civil immigration detention at Cibola \nwhile his immigration case was processed. \n50.  Shortly after arriving at Cibola, Mr. Awombang began working as a janitor at the \nfacility.  ln this position, Mr. Awombang worked approximately seven days per week, several \nhours per day.  CoreCivic knew that Mr. Awombang was performing this work and permitted \nhim to do so.  Guards, who were CoreCivic employees, supervised his work, and CoreCivic \nprovided the cleaning supplies and tools necessary to perform the work.  CoreCivic benefitted \nfrom Mr. Awombang's cleaning work because it was necessary to maintain the facility at a \nprofit.  CoreCivic paid Mr. Awombang only one dollar per day for his cleaning work. \n51.  After approximately two months, Mr. Awombang began working in the kitchen, \nwhere he worked approximately five and a half to six hours per day, five days per week. \nCoreCivic controlled Mr. Awombang's work hours through its staffing plan.  Mr. Awombang \nworked alongside people who were not detained.  He worked in this position for approximately \nfour months. \n52.  CoreCivic knew that Mr. Awombang worked in the kitchen and permitted him to \ndo so.  Guards, who were CoreCivic employees, supervised Mr. Awombang's work.  Further, \nCoreCivic provided the facilities and tools necessary for Mr. Awombang to perform his work. \nCoreCivic benefitted from Mr. Awombang's kitchen work because it was necessary to keep the \nfacility operational at a profit, as CoreCivic did not employ or subcontract enough people who \nwere not detained to run the kitchen without them. Because it employed Mr. Awombang, \nCoreCivic did not need to employ someone else (who would have been paid at rates compliant \n12 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-03521-RDB   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 13 of 26\nwith the FLSA, the NMMWA, and the Service Contract Act) to perform the tasks that Mr. \nA wombang performed. \n53.  CoreCivic paid Mr. Awombang $15 per week without regard to the number of \nhours he worked. \n54.  Mr. Awombang used his wages to purchase basic necessities while in detention. \nCoreCivic deducted the cost of such necessities from Mr. Awombang's account.  When he was \nreleased, CoreCivic paid Mr. Awombang funds remaining in his account. \nFLSA COLLECTIVE ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n55.  CoreCivic failed to pay the Plaintiffs and all others similarly situated the \nminimum wages required by the FLSA, 29 U.S.C. §§ 20 I, et seq. \n56.  CoreCivic failed to pay the Plaintiffs and all others similarly situated for all hours \nworked and failed to pay an effective hourly rate at or above the federal minimum wage rate of \n$7.25 per hour through its practices of paying a flat rate that was less than the legally required \nwage for their work, and sometimes as little as one dollar per day. \n57.  This action can, and should, be maintained as a collective action pursuant to 29 \nU.S.C. § 216(b) for all claims to unpaid or underpaid wages and liquidated damages that can be \nredressed under the FLSA. \n58.  Plaintiffs seek certification of these claims as a collective action on behalf of all \ncivilly detained immigrants who performed work for CoreCivic at Cibola through its work \nprogram at any time during the period beginning two years prior to the date on which this action \nis filed and continuing to the date on which notice is issued of the opportunity to join this action. \n59.  Plaintiffs reserve the right to revise the definition of the class based upon \ninformation learned after the filing of this action. \n13 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-03521-RDB   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 14 of 26\n60.  Upon information and belief, there are hundreds of similarly situated current and \nformer civilly detained immigrants at Cibola who have been subjected to the same unlawful \nconduct that the Plaintiffs challenge herein. \n61.  Members of the proposed collective action are similarly situated. CoreCivic \ncivilly detained such members in the same facility, Cibola.  CoreCivic permitted such members \nto work, and such members did work, for the benefit ofCoreCivic but were compensated at rates \nbelow the FLSA-mandated minimum wage. \n62.  Members of the proposed collective action have been subjected to the same or \nsubstantially the same pay policies and practices. \n63.  Members of the proposed collective action have been subjected to the same or \nsubstantially the same policy or practice that required or permitted them to perform work for \nCoreCivic's benefit, but compensated them at rates below the FLSA-mandated minimum wage. \n64.  The identities of the members of the proposed collective action are known to \nCoreCivic and can be located through CoreCivic's records. \n65.  Members ofthe proposed collective action would benefit from the issuance of \nCourt-supervised Notice and the opportunity to join this lawsuit. \n66.  A collective action will provide the most efficient mechanism for adjudicating the \nclaims ofPlaintiffs and members ofthe proposed collective action. \n67.  Therefore, Plaintiffs request that they be permitted to serve as representatives of \nthose who consent to participate in this action and that the action be granted collective action \nstatus pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 216(b). \n14 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-03521-RDB   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 15 of 26\nRULE 23 NEW MEXICO MINIMUM WAGE ACT CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n68.  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, Plaintiffs bring class-action \nclaims for unpaid or underpaid wages under the NMMWA, NM Stat. Ann. §§ 50-4-21, et seq. \n69.  Plaintiffs bring these class-action claims on behalf of themselves and all other \ncivilly detained immigrants who performed work for CoreCivic at Cibola in its work program at \nany time from two years prior to the filing of this action through the date on which notice is \nissued affording the right to opt out of any class certified pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3) (\"New \nMexico Minimum Wage Act Class\"). \n70.  Plaintiffs reserve the right to revise the definition of the class based upon \ninformation learned after the filing of this action. \n71.  Plaintiffs bring these claims on behalf of themselves and members of the New \nMexico Minimum Wage Act Class under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a), (b)(2) for their \nrequests for declaratory and injunctive relief only, and (b )(3) for their requests for damages.  The \nproposed New Mexico Minimum Wage Act Class satisfies the numerosity, commonality, \ntypicality, adequacy, predominance, and superiority requirements ofthose rules. \n72.  Numerosity: The proposed class is so numerous that the joinder of all such \npersons is impracticable, and the disposition oftheir claims as a class will benefit the parties and \nthe Court. The exact number of class members is unknown to Plaintiffs at this time, because it is \nwithin CoreCivic's control.  However, upon information and belief, the class comprises hundreds \nof members.  Membership in the class is ascertainable from CoreCivic's detention and \nemployment records. \n73.  Commonality: Plaintiffs and all members of the New Mexico Minimum Wage \nAct Class have been compensated using the unlawful practices alleged herein and, therefore, one \n15 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-03521-RDB   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 16 of 26\nor more questions of law or fact are common to the New Mexico Minimum Wage Act Class. \nThese common questions include, but are not limited to, the following: \na.  Whether CoreCivic is an employer of Plaintiffs and members of the New Mexico \nMinimum Wage Act Class within the meaning ofthe NMMWA; \nb.  Whether Plaintiffs and members of the New Mexico Minimum Wage Acl Class \nare employees within the meaning ofthe NMMWA; \nc.  Whether CoreCivic engaged, suffered, or permitted Plaintiffs and members of the \nNew Mexico Minimum Wage Act Class to work on its behalf; \nd.  Whether the minimum wage in the NMMWA applies to Plaintiffs and members \nof the New Mexico Minimum Wage Act Class; \ne.  Whether CoreCivic failed or refused to pay Plaintiffs and members of the New \nMexico Minimum Wage Act Class the minimum wage required by the NMMW A; \n74.  Typicality: Plaintiffs and members of the New Mexico Minimum Wage Act \nClass were subjected to the same unlawful policies, practices, and procedures and sustained \nsimilar losses, injuries, and damages. All class members were subjected to the same \ncompensation practices by CoreCivic, as alleged herein, that required or permitted them to \nperform work for CoreCivic's benefit, but compensated them at rates below the NMMWA \nmandated minimum wage.  Plaintiffs' claims are therefore typical of the claims that could be \nbrought by any member of the New Mexico Minimum Wage Act Class, and the relief sought is \ntypical of the relief that could be sought by each member of the New Mexico Minimum Wage \nAct Class in separate actions. \n75.  Adequacy of Representation: Plaintiffs are able to fairly and adequately protect \nthe interests of all members of the Class, as they are challenging the same practices as the class \n16 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-03521-RDB   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 17 of 26\nas a whole, and there are no known conflicts of interest between Plaintiffs and the members of \nthe New Mexico Minimum Wage Act Class.  Plaintiffs have retained counsel who have \nextensive experience with the prosecution of wage-and-hour claims and complex class-action \nlitigation. \n76.  Predominance and Superiority: The common questions identified above \npredominate over any individual issues.  A class action is superior to other available means for \nthe fair and efficient adjudication of this controversy. \n77.  Pursuit of this action as a class would provide the most efficient mechanism for \nadjudicating the claims ofPlaintiffs and the members of the New Mexico Minimum Wage Act \nClass. \nRULE 23 NEW MEXICO UNJUST ENRICHMENT CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n78.  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, Plaintiffs bring class-action \nclaims for unjust enrichment under New Mexico common law. \n79.  Plaintiffs bring these class-action claims on behalf of themselves and all other \ncivilly detained immigrants who performed work for CoreCivic at Cibola in its work program \nfour years prior to the filing of this action through the date on which notice is issued affording \nthe right to opt out of any class certified pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3) (\"Unjust Enrichment Class\"). \n80.  Plaintiffs performed all work during the class period in the absence of an \nenforceable employment contract with CoreCivic. \n81.  Plaintiffs reserve the right to revise the definition of the classes based upon \ninformation learned after the filing of this action. \n82.  Plaintiffs bring these claims on behalf of themselves and members of the Unjust \nEnrichment Class under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a), (b)(2) for their requests for \n17 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-03521-RDB   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 18 of 26\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief only, and (b )(3) for their requests for damages.  The proposed \nUnjust Enrichment Class satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality, adequacy, \npredominance, and superiority requirements ofthose rules. \n83.  Numerosity: The proposed class is so numerous that the joinder of all such \npersons is impracticable, and the disposition of their claims as a class will benefit the parties and \nthe Court.  The exact number of class members is unknown to Plaintiffs at this time, because it is \nwithin CoreCivic's control.  However, upon information and belief, the class comprises hundreds \nof members.  Membership in the class is ascertainable from CoreCivic's detention and \nemployment records. \n84.  Commonality: Plaintiffs and all members of the Unjust Enrichment Class have \nbeen compensated using the unlawful practices alleged herein and, therefore, one or more \nquestions of law or fact are common to the Unjust Enrichment Class.  These common questions \ninclude, but are not limited to, the following: \na.  Whether CoreCivic knowingly benefitted from the labor of Plaintiffs and \nmembers of the Unjust Enrichment Class; \nb.  Whether CoreCivic failed to pay fair and adequate compensation to Plaintiffs and \nmembers of the Unjust Enrichment Class; \nc.  Whether it would be unjust for CoreCivic to retain the benefit from any failure to \npay fair and adequate compensation to Plaintiffs and members of the Unjust \nEnrichment Class; \n85.  Typicality: Plaintiffs and members of the Unjust Enrichment Class were \nsubjected to the same unlawful policies, practices, and procedures and sustained similar losses, \ninjuries, and damages. All class members were subjected to the same compensation practices by \n18 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-03521-RDB   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 19 of 26\nCoreCivic, as alleged herein, that required or permitted them to perform work for CoreCivic's \nbenefit, but denied them fair and adequate compensation, including FLSA-mandated and \nNMMWA-mandated minimum wages and the prevailing wage in Cibola's locality.  Plaintiffs' \nclaims are therefore typical of the claims that could be brought by any member of the Unjust \nEnrichment Class, and the relief sought is typical of the relief that could be sought by each \nmember of the Unjust Enrichment Class in separate actions. \n86.  Adequacy of Representation: Plaintiffs are able to fairly and adequately protect \nthe interests of all members of the Unjust Enrichment Class, as they are challenging the same \npractices as the class as a whole, and there are no known conflicts of interest between Plaintiffs \nand the members ofthe Unjust Enrichment Class.  Plaintiffs have retained counsel who have \nextensive experience with the prosecution of wage-and-hour claims and complex class-action \nlitigation. \n87.  Predominance and Superiority: The common questions identified above \npredominate over any individual issues.  A class action is superior to other available means for \nthe fair and efficient adjudication of this controversy. \n88.  Pursuit of this action as a class would provide the most efficient mechanism for \nadjudicating the claims of Plaintiffs and the members of the Unjust Enrichment Class. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nCOUNT I \nFAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT OF 1938 \n29 U.S.C. §§ 201, et seq. \n89.
