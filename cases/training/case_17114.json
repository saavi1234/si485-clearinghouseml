    "summary": "<p>In 2016, the FBI sought and obtained a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant against Trump 2016 campaign foreign policy advisor Carter Page. The warrant applications against Page alleged that he had contact with Russian officials to collect compromising information on Trump's 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton.</p>\r\n<p>After substantial litigation, these classified FISA warrants and related documents were disclosed. This Clearinghouse entry includes those underlying applications and renewals. There are 4, each with a different Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) docket number:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>16-1182: the initial order, October 2016</li>\r\n<li>17-52: the first renewal, January 2017</li>\r\n<li>17-375: the second renewal, April 2017</li>\r\n<li>17-679: the third renewal, June 2017</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>This entry will also discuss efforts by the FISC to protect the classified information contained in the warrants. These filings appear on docket 16-1182.</p>\r\n<p>For more information on the litigation in the FISC and U.S. District Courts to release these documents, see <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16844\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this link</a>. For more information on reform of the overall FISA warrant process inspired by the Carter Page case, see <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17413\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this link</a>.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>FISA requires the government to obtain a warrant from the FISC before it may conduct any domestic electronic surveillance to acquire foreign intelligence information. The warrant applications are made ex parte and must include a sworn statement by a federal officer of the facts and circumstances relied upon to justify the government's belief that the target of surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power. Once a FISC judge receives a warrant application, the judge can order approval of the surveillance only if the judge finds that there is probable cause to believe that the target of the electronic surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power. Because the orders only authorize surveillance up to 90 days, the government must file an application for an extension that meets the same requirements as the initial warrant application and obtain a renewal order from the FISC for continued surveillance. For the Civil Rights Litigation Clearinghouse collection of FISA matters, see our <a href=\"../../../../search/case/?special_collection=5659&amp;ordering=-summary_approved_date\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">special collection</a>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>I. The Contents of the Warrants</strong></p>\r\n<p>On July 21, 2018, in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, the Department of Justice (DOJ) released the FISA warrant applications related to the surveillance of Trump campaign advisor Carter Page. <em>The New York Times</em>, which filed the FOIA request, released the documents in an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/21/us/politics/carter-page-fisa.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">article published on the same day</a>; the FISC did not release the warrants.</p>\r\n<p>Although the documents are heavily redacted, they revealed that in October 2016, the FBI submitted an application to the FISC to wiretap Page because the FBI believed that Page had been the \"subject of targeted recruitment by the Russian government . . . [redacted] undermine and influence the outcome of the 2016 U.S. Presidential election in violation of U.S. criminal law.\" The FBI believed that Page had \"established relationships with Russian government officials, including Russian intelligence officers\" and that \"the Russian government's efforts are being coordinated with Page and perhaps other individuals associated with\" then-presidential candidate Trump.</p>\r\n<p>According to the FBI, Page had traveled to Russia in July 2016 to deliver a commencement address at a school. During that trip, Page also met with at least two Russian officials. The FBI asserted that one of its confidential informants, who had a history of reliability, reported that Page \"had a secret meeting with Igor Sechin,\" who is \"a close associate to Russian President Putin.\" The FBI's confidential informant also relayed that Page had secretly met with Igor Divyekin, a Russian official who is believed by U.S. officials to have responsibility for intelligence collected by Russian agencies about the U.S. election, and that \"their agenda for the meeting included Divyekin raising a dossier or 'kompromat' that the Kremlin possessed on\" Hillary Clinton and the \"possibility of it being released\" to presidential candidate Trump.</p>\r\n<p>Sometime in October 2016, FISC judge Rosemary M. Collyer found that on \"the basis of the facts submitted in the verified application, there is probable cause to believe\" that Page \"is an agent of Russia.\" This is the initial warrant, docketed as 16-1182. She authorized the warrant, which was to expire sometime in January 2017.</p>\r\n<p>In January 2017, the FBI renewed its warrant application, which FISC judge Michael Mosman granted later that month under docket 17-52. The renewal was set to expire sometime in April 2017.</p>\r\n<p>In April 2017, the FBI submitted a second renewal application, which FISC judge Anne C. Conway granted later that month under docket 17-375. This second renewal was set to expire sometime in June 2017.</p>\r\n<p>In June 2017, the FBI submitted a third renewal application, which FISC judge Raymond J. Dearie granted later that month under docket 17-679. This third renewal expired sometime in September 2017.</p>\r\n<p>The non-redacted portions of the original warrant application and the three renewal applications were largely identical. Due to the redacted nature of the applications, it is unclear whether the FBI provided the FISC courts with additional intelligence, gained from its original wiretap, in support of its renewals.</p>\r\n<p><strong>II. Protecting the Information in the Warrants</strong></p>\r\n<p>On December 9, 2019, the FBI Office of the Inspector General (OIG) published the &ldquo;Crossfire Hurricane&rdquo; Report, named after the FBI&rsquo;s codename for its investigation into Page. The report found that there had been \"material misstatements and omissions\" in the FISA warrant applications that led to the four orders listed above. For more information on the Crossfire Hurricane report, see <a href=\"../../../../detail.php?id=17413\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">In re Accuracy Concerns Regarding FBI Matters Submitted to the FISC</a>.</p>\r\n<p>In response to the Crossfire Hurricane report, Judge James E. Boasberg issued an order on docket 16-1182 requesting government comment on the four Carter Page surveillance warrants on January 7, 2020. Judge Boasberg's order directed the government to produce a disclosure detailing the steps it had already taken to protect the information in the four warrants and future steps to protect the information by January 28, 2020. On January 23, 2020, the Government requested additional time to respond to FISC's order. Judge Boasberg approved the request, and the new deadline became February 5, 2020.</p>\r\n<p>The disclosure was not publicly released to the docket. Subsequent filings reveal that the government provided two supplemental responses to the January 7 order on February 28 and April 17, though neither were publicly released.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Boasberg released an opinion and order on June 25, 2020 responding to the Government filings and discussing future situations where disclosure might be necessary. Judge Boasberg noted that FISA sections 1807 and 1827 forbid the government from releasing illegally obtained information, like the information in the Page FISA warrants, but highlighted an exception from a 2010 FISC opinion for \"actions that are <u>necessary</u> to mitigate or prevent the very harms at which [that section] is addressed\" (emphasis in original), as long as minimization procedures are followed. He discussed how these tensions play out in five situations where disclosure may be necessary:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Third-Party FOIA Cases: the government noted that two nonprofits were seeking minimized information from the Page FISA warrants in FOIA suits before the District Court for the District of Columbia. To prevent an effective freeze on FOIA litigation on this subject, Judge Boasberg permitted disclosure on these dockets \"insofar as necessary for the good-faith conduct\" of FOIA litigation, even if it does not directly remedy the injustice of wrongly collected information.</li>\r\n<li>Page's Civil Litigation: by the time this opinion was released, Page already filed a FOIA complaint seeking information on the warrants against him (<a href=\"../../../../detail.php?id=17962\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Page v. U.S. Department of Justice</a>), and was threatening to file a damages complaint (he eventually did&mdash;see <a href=\"../../../../detail.php?id=17963\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Page v. Comey</a> in this Clearinghouse). Judge Boasberg applied the same logic to the previous FOIA case to this one, adding that this case may also be authorized under the theory that it directly remedies injuries against the target of the unauthorized surveillance, but left it to the District Courts to officially decide the issue. He added that the civil nature of Page's complaint was not a barrier to relief, either.</li>\r\n<li>Review of FBI Personnel Conduct: Judge Boasberg allowed the FBI to use the Page FISA warrant materials to conduct personnel reviews of the people that completed them because these were narrow enough parameters to allow release. He was hesitant to allow broader use of the warrants outside of remedying conduct of specific individuals, though.</li>\r\n<li>DOJ Inspector General Oversight: the DOJ Inspector General was using parts of the Page warrants to oversee implementation of FISA warrant request reform. Judge Boasberg noted that most of this oversight was systemic and not related to specific information in the Page warrants, and he forbade disclosure in these settings. However, he allowed disclosure only for FBI agents investigating misconduct by personnel working on the warrants, similar to the situation in the previous bullet.</li>\r\n<li>Criminal Investigation and Prosecution: U.S. Attorneys in Connecticut were \"review[ing...] intelligence activities relating to campaigns in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election,\" and sought access to the warrants. Judge Boasberg noted that, while the Page warrants could be useful for specific claims, he would not let the U.S. Attorneys have access to the files on the broad grounds they had described. Subsequent files noted that the government filed another responsive report on October 21, 2020, though it was not publicized.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>On November 23, 2020, Judge Boasberg issued an order permitting disclosure of the warrants to attorneys in the U.S. Attorney's office in the Eastern District of Missouri and the District of the District of Columbia. He expressed confidence in both offices' abilities to protect confidential information in the warrants after hearing their responses to questioning in a November 6 hearing. These disclosures likely were linked to an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/new-justice-dept-disclosures-cast-fresh-doubt-on-trump-russia-investigation/2020/09/25/f08ccfb0-ff61-11ea-9ceb-061d646d9c67_story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">investigation</a> these offices were conducting into the Page warrants specifically.</p>\r\n<p>On June 7, 2023, the government filed a motion to permit the disclosure of classified information about the FISA applications targeting Page that had been included as an appendix to Special Counsel John H. Duram&rsquo;s report about the 2016 Presidential Campaigns. The information would be shared with select members of Congress and staff who have oversight over FISA. On June 8, 2023, the FISC granted the motion and allowed the government to give access to the information in the classified appendix to members and staff of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, and the House Judiciary Committee, and other specific members. On June 29, 2023, the government informed the court that it was now allowing members of Congress and staff to view the documents in a secure facility.</p>\r\n<p>As of November 17, 2023, the case is ongoing.&nbsp;</p>",

PAGE,  DocketNos: 16-1182, 17-52, 17-375, \n17-679 \nA US.PERSON \nOPINION AND ORDER REGARDING USE \nAND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION \nOn four occasions in 2016 and 2017, upon application by the government in the above \ncaptioned dockets, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court approved electronic surveillance \n. and physical search targeting Carter W. Page pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct, codified as amended at 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801-1885c.  The government has acknowledged that \nat least some of its collection under color of those FISC orders was unlawful.  It nevertheless \nnow contends that it must temporarily retain, and potentially use and disclose, the information \ncollected, largely in the context of ongoing or anticipated litigation.  The Court hereby sets \nparameters for such use or disclosure. \nI.  Background \nPrior orders of this Court have discussed material errors and omissions in the applications \nin the above-captioned dockets, which errors pertained to whether there was probable cause to \nbelieve that Page was an agent of a foreign power.  See Corrected Op. and Order, Misc. No. 19-\n02 (FISA Ct. Mar. 5, 2020); Order, Misc. No. 19-02 (FISA Ct. Dec. 17, 2019).  Those errors and \nomissions were largely uncovered by the Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of \nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN/FISA \nAuthorized for Public Release on: September 11, 2020  Page 1 of 21  FISC Opinion, Jun. 25, 2020\n\nFISA Titles I and III FISC Opinion Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN/FISA \nJustice.  See OIG, DOJ, Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI's \nCrossfire HmTicane Investigation (Dec. 2019 (revised)) (\"OIG Report\"). \nOn December 9, 2019, the government advised the Court of its assessment that, for the \napplications in Docket Numbers 17-375 and 17-679, \"if not earlier, there was insufficient \npredication to establish probable cause to believe that Page was acting as an agent of a foreign \npower.\"  Additional Rule I 3(a) Letter Regarding Applications Submitted to the Ct. Targeting \nCarter W. Page in Docket Nos. 2016-1182, 2017-0052, 2017-0375, and 2017-0679, at 19 (Dec. \n9, 2019).  The government further reported that the FBI would \"sequester all collection the FBI \nacquired pursuant to the Court's authorizations in the above-listed four docket numbers ... \npending further review\" of the OIG Report and \"the outcome ofrelated investigations and any \nlitigation.\"  Id. at 19-20 ( emphasis added).  Information acquired under color of the above \ncaptioned dockets, in both minimized and un-minimized (i.e., raw) form, will be referred to as \n\"Page FISA information.\" \nOn January 7, 2020, the Court ordered the government to explain how it is restricting \naccess to the Page FISA information and why its retention and any contemplated use or \ndisclosure are necessary and lawful.  See Order Regarding Handling and Disposition of \nInformation at 2, Nos. 16-1182, 17-52, 17-375, 17-679 (FISA Ct. Jan. 7, 2020), declassified \nversion available at https://fisc.uscourts.gov/public-filings/order-regarding-handling-and \ndisposition-information.  The government responded on February 5, February 28, and April 17, \n2020.  See Resp. to the Ct. 's Order Dated Jan. 7, 2020, Nos. I 6-1182, 17-52, 17-375, 17-679 \n(Feb. 5, 2020); Supplemental Resp. to the Ct. 's Order Dated Jan. 7, 2020, Nos. 16-1182, 17-52, \n17-375, 17-679 (Feb. 28, 2020); Second Supplemental Resp. to the Ct.'s Order Dated Jan. 7, \n2020, Nos. 16-1182, 17-52, 17-375, 17-679 (Apr. 17, 2020). \nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN/FISA \n2 \nAuthorized for Public Release on: September 11, 2020  Page 2 of 21  FISC Opinion, Jun. 25, 2020\n\nFISA Titles I and III FISC Opinion Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN/FISA \nII.  Analysis \nAfter examining the relevant provisions of FISA, the Court will evaluate the grounds put \nforward by the government for retaining, using, and disclosing Page FISA infonnation. \nA.  The Relevant Statutory Provisions \nFISA restricts the use and disclosure of infonnation acquired by unauthorized electronic \nsurveillance or physical search that was conducted under color of a FISA authorization.  See 50 \nU.S.C. §§ 1809(a)(2), 1827(a)(2).  It also has minimization requirements, which regulate the \nretention and dissemination of PISA-acquired information generally. \nI.  Sections I 809(a)(2) and l 827(a)(2) \nIt is a criminal offense to \"intentionally ... (I) engage[ ] in electronic surveillance under \ncolor of law except as authorized by\" identified statutory provisions, or \"(2) disclose( ] or use[ ) \ninformation obtained under color of law by electronic surveillance, knowing or having reason to \nknow that the information was obtained through electronic surveillance not authorized\" by FISA \nor another \"express statutory authorization.\"  § 1809(a).  It is similarly an offense to intentionally \nconduct a physical search under color of law within the United States to obtain foreign \nintelligence information, \"except as authorized by statute,\" or intentionally disclose or use \ninformation obtained by such a search, \"knowing or having reason to know that the infonnation \nwas obtained through physical search not authorized by statute, for the purpose of obtaining \nintelligence infonnation.\"  § 1827(a). \nThe government acknowledges that there were material omissions, and the Court has \nfound violations of the government's duty of candor, in all four applications.  See Resp. to the \nCt. 's Corrected Op. and Order Dated Mar. 5, 2020, and Update to the Gov't's Jan. 10, 2020, \nResp. at 20-21, Misc. No. 19-02 (Apr. 3, 2020); Order at 2-3 & nn.7-8, Misc. No. 19-02 (FISA \nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN/FISA \n3 \nAuthorized for Public Release on: September 11, 2020  Page 3 of 21  FISC Opinion, Jun. 25, 2020\n\nFISA Titles I and III FISC Opinion Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN/FISA \nCt. Dec. 17, 2019).  As noted above, the government admits that at least the third and fourth \nPage applications lacked adequate factual support.  See Dec. 9, 2019, Letter at 2, 19.  It further \nadmits that \"the restrictions on use or disclosure in Sections 1809 and 1827 apply at least\" to \ninformation acquired under color of the third and fourth dockets, without addressing whether \nthey apply to information acquired under color of the first two dockets.  See Feb. 5, 2020, Resp. \nat 28.  In fact, in response to the Conrt's directive to explain why retaining the Page FISA \ninformation \"in the manner intended by the government, and any contemplated use or disclosure \nofit,\" comport with§§ 1809(a)(2) and 1827(a)(2), Jan. 7, 2020, Order at 2, the government \ndeclined to argue, even alternatively, that those provisions do not apply ( or apply differently) to \ninformation obtained under the first two dockets.  See Feb. 5, 2020, Resp. at 28-29.  Under the \ncircumstances, the Court will assume that§§ l 809(a)(2) and l 827(a)(2) apply to information \nacquired under color of the first and second dockets just as, per the government's admission, \nthey apply to information acquired under color of the third and fourth. \nProceeding from that premise, the plain meaning of those statutory provisions prohibits \nintentional use or disclosure of the Page FISA information by anyone who knows or has reason \nto know it was acquired by unauthorized electronic surveillance or physical search.  The FISC \nhas, however, recognized an exception to the unqualified language of§ I 809(a)(2) for \"actions \nthat are necessary to mitigate or prevent the very ha1ms at which [that section] is addressed.\" \nSee Op. and Order Regarding Fruits of Unauthorized Elec. Surveillance, Nos. 06-1482, et al., at \n8 (FISA Ct. Dec. 10, 2010) (\"December 10, 20 I 0, Opinion and Order\") ( emphasis in original). \n(That prior case did not involve physical search and therefore did not implicate § 1827(a)(2).) \nSpecifically, some uses or disclosures may be \"necessary to avoid similar instances of over \ncollection ... or to remedy a prior over-collection.\"  Id. at 7.  The Court recognized that \nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN/FISA \n4 \nAuthorized for Public Release on: September 11, 2020  Page 4 of 21  FISC Opinion, Jun. 25, 2020\n\nFISA Titles I and III FISC Opinion Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN/FISA \nexception because, \"in limited circumstances, prohibiting use or disclosure of the results of \nunauthorized electronic surveillance would be so absurd or glaringly unjust ... as to [ call into] \nquestion whether Congress actually intended what the plain language of Section l 809(a)(2) so \nclearly imports.\"  Op. and Order Requiring Destruction ofinformation Obtained by \nUnauthorized Elec. Surveillance at 5, Nos. 06-1482, et al. (FISA Ct. May 13, 2011) (quoting \nUnited States v. Rodgers, 466 U.S. 475,484 (1984)) (\"May 13, 2011, Opinion\"). \n2.  Minimization Provisions \nThe government must also handle information obtained by FISA electronic surveillance \nand physical search in accordance with FISC-approved minimization procedures.  For electronic \nsurveillance, there must be \"specific procedures ... that are reasonably designed in light of the \npurpose and technique of the particular surveillance, to minimize the acquisition and retention, \nand prohibit the dissemination\" of private information about unconsenting U.S. persons \n\"consistent with the need of the United States to obtain, produce, and disseminate foreign \nintelligence information.\"  50 U.S.C. § 1801(h)(l).  Notwithstanding that requirement, the \nprocedures should \"allow for the retention and dissemination of information that is evidence of a \ncrime which has been, is being, or is about to be committed and that is to be retained or \ndisseminated for law enforcement purposes.\"  § 1801(h)(3).  Substantively identical \nminimization requirements apply to FISA physical searches.  See 50 U.S.C. § 1821(4)(A), (C). \nIn order to approve an electronic surveillance or physical search, the Court must find that the \nprocedures satisfy these requirements and direct that they be followed.  See 50 U.S.C. \n§§ 1805(a)(3), (c)(2)(A); 1824(a)(3), (c)(2)(A). \nIn this case, the applicable minimization procedures have a \"litigation-hold\" provision \nunder which the FBI \"may temporarily retain,\" subject to restricted-access requirements, \nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN/FISA \n5 \nAuthorized for Public Release on: September 11, 2020  Page 5 of 21  FISC Opinion, Jun. 25, 2020\n\nFISA Titles I and III FISC Opinion Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN/FISA \n\"specific FISA-acquired information that would otherwise have to be destroyed pursuant to these \nminimization procedures,\n.\"  Standard Minimization \nProcedures for FBI Blee. Surveillance and Physical Search Conducted Under the FISA § III.l.4 \nat 41 (May 17, 2016) (\"FBI SMPs\") (e mphasis added).  But that provision does not apply to the \nPage FISA information because that information does not otherwise have to destroyed pursuant \nto the FBI SMPs.  The FBI SMPs, in other words, do not contain a provision requiring the FBI to \ndestroy the results of unauthorized surveillance or search.  A separate provision, moreover, \nconfirms that Section III.I.4 does not authorize retention of the Page FISA information: \"Nothing \nin these Procedures permits the retention of information obtained through unauthorized \nelectronic surveillance or physical search.\"  FBI SMPs §III.Fat 31 n.10 (emphasis added). \nB.  The Government's Grounds for Retaining, and Potentially Using and Disclosing, \nthe Page FISA Information \nHaving now set the statutory backdrop, the Court may examine the government's discrete \npositions here.  The government contemplates retention, use, and disclosure of some or all of the \nPage FISA information in several contexts, specifically:  (I) ongoing litigation with third-party \nplaintiffs pursuant to the Freedom of Infornmtion Act, see Apr. 17, 2020, Resp. at 9-1 O; Feb. 28, \n2020, Resp. at 10-11; Feb. 5, 2020 Resp. at 27; (2) ongoing and anticipated civil litigation with \nPage, see Apr. 17, 2020, Resp. at 7-8; Feb. 28, 2020, Resp. at 8-9; Feb. 5, 2020, Resp. at 26-27; \n(3) FBI review of the conduct of its personnel in the Page investigation, see Apr. 17, 2020, Resp. \nat 7; (4) DOJ OIG's monitoring of the implementation of the recommendations in the OIG \nReport and auditing of the FBI's compliance with its accuracy procedures (also called \"Woods\" \nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN/FISA \n6 \nAuthorized for Public Release on: September 11, 2020  Page 6 of 21  FISC Opinion, Jun. 25, 2020\n\nFISA Titles I and III FISC Opinion Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN/FISA \nprocedures), see Feb. 5, 2020, Resp. at 20; and (5) review of,\nthe conduct of government personnel in the Page investigation and the broader \n\"Crossfire Hurricane\" investigation of Russian interference in the 20 I 6 Presidential election. \nSee id. at 25-26. \nBefore drilling down on these specific contexts, some general observations may prove \nhelpful.  To begin, retention must be distinguished from use and disclosure.  Regarding \nretention, the government asserts that \"all of the information from the above four dockets needs \nto be preserved\" in order for it \"to comply with ... discovery obligations that may arise in the \ncurrent civil litigation, as well as any discovery obligations that may arise in the future vis-'a-vis \nother possible litigation.\"  Feb. 5, 2020, Resp. at 36; Feb. 28, 2020, Resp. at 11.  Much, if not all, \nof such infonnation is indeed subject to pending FOIA litigation brought by Page.  See infra p. \n12.  Importantly, neither FISA nor the applicable minimization procedures explicitly require the \ngovernment to destroy the Page FISA information.  See supra pp. 3, 6.  It is true that, even absent \nsuch a requirement, the FISC has nonetheless ordered destruction of information obtained \nthrough unauthorized physical search when there was no reason to anticipate circumstances in \nwhich use or disclosure would be permitted.  See Order Requiring Destruction oflnformation \nObtained By Unauthorized Physical Searches at 3-4, Nos. 18-45, 19-403 (FISA Ct. Oct. 21, \n2019).  Those circumstances are distinguishable because, as discussed below, some permissible \nforms of use and disclosure of Page FISA information are reasonably anticipated here. \nMoving beyond retention, not all of the government's arguments regarding use and \ndisclosure are persuasive.  First, it contends that \"strict access controls [w  ill] ensure\" that the \nPage FISA information \"may not be used for analysis or further investigation.\"  Feb. 5, 2020, \nResp. at 36; Feb. 28, 2020, Resp. at 11; Apr. 17, 2020, Resp. at 10.  But a FISC judge previously \nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN/FISA \n7 \nAuthorized for Public Release on: September 11, 2020  Page 7 of 21  FISC Opinion, Jun. 25, 2020\n\nFISA Titles I and III FISC Opinion Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN/FISA \nrejected the interpretation that§ l 809(a)(2) only prohibits use or disclosure for investigative or \nanalytical purposes.  See Dec. 10, 2010, Op. and Order at 6-7.  And notwithstanding its \ndisavowal of analytical or investigative use, the government contemplates use and disclosure of \nthe Page FISA information not only in civil litigation, but also in the course of performance and \ndisciplinary reviews of the conduct of FBI personnel, as well as potential criminal prosecutions. \nThe government also argues that \"Congress did not intend FISA or ... [FISA] \nminimization procedures ... to abrogate the rights afforded to defendants in criminal \nproceedings\" and submits without explanation \"that the same reasoning would apply in civil \nproceedings.\"  Feb. 5, 2020, Resp. at 34-35.  The only authority cited for the initial premise is a \ndiscussion in legislative history of provisions that, as modified, were enacted and codified at 50 \nU.S.C. § 1806:  \"(N]othing in these subsections (of what became§ 1806] abrogates the rights \nafforded a criminal defendant under Brady v. Maryland, and the Jencks Act.\"  H.R. Rep. No. 95-\n1283, pt. I, at 89 (1978) (emphasis added, footnotes omitted); see also S. Rep. No. 95-604, pt. I, \nat 55-56 (1978)) (same).  By its terms, that statement says nothing about the intended effect of \n§§ 1809(a)(2) and 1827(a)(2).  (The Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3500, requires production ofa \nprosecution witness's prior statements.  Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (I 963), requires \nproduction of material evidence favorable to a criminal defendant upon request.) \nSection 1806 establishes procedures, moreover, for a court to determine the legality of an \nelectronic surveillance before information thereby obtained is used against an aggrieved person \nin a legal proceeding.  In contrast, §§ 1809(a)(2) and I 827(a)(2) specifically address the \ncircumstances of this case, where we already know that information was obtained through \nunlawful surveillance and search, but the government contemplates using and disclosing it \nanyway. \nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN/FISA \n8 \nAuthorized for Public Release on: September 11, 2020  Page 8 of 21  FISC Opinion, Jun. 25, 2020\n\nFISA Titles I and III FISC Opinion Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN/FISA \nMore fundamentally, any tension between the prohibitions of§§ 1809(a)(2) and \n1827(a)(2) and the rights of a potential criminal defendant can be eliminated by the \ngovernment's forgoing the prosecution in which use or disclosure of the results of unauthorized \nsurveillance or search would be necessary.  Potentially letting the guilty escape prosecution is a \nheavy burden for the government, and the public, to bear.  But \"Congress may have thought it \nless important that some offenders should go unwhipped of justice than that officers should \nresort to methods deemed inconsistent with ethical standards and destructive of personal liberty.\" \nNardone v. United States, 302 U.S. 379, 383 (1937) (holding that statutory prohibition on \nintercepting a communication and divulging or publishing its contents barred federal agents from \ntestifying at a criminal trial about what they overheard on a wiretap).  Congress may also have \nsought to avoid the further intrusion into the privacy of persons subjected to unlawful \nsurveillance that would result from prosecutorial use of surveillance information.  The \nunqualified language of§§ 1809(a)(2) and 1827(a)(2) evidences that Congress intended for the \ngovernment to be deprived of such prosecutorial uses, at least in some cases. \nBecause the government's broad-brush arguments on use and disclosure are \nunpersuasive, the Court will separately examine each context in which the government \ncontemplates use or disclosure of the Page FISA information. \n1.  Third-Party FOIA Litigation \nThe government has identified two third-party FOIA cases that implicate records that \ncontain some of the Page FISA information in apparently minimized form: \n(1)  Judicial Watch, Inc. v.  DOJ, No.  18-1854 (D.D.C.), in which \"plaintiffs \nseek,  inter  alia,  all  records  from  [the  Office  of the  Deputy  Attorney \nGeneral  (ODAG)]  relating  to  Fusion  OPS,  Nellie  Ohr  and/or  British \nnational  Christopher  Steele.\"  Feb.  28,  2020,  Resp.  at  10.  ODAG \npossessed \"copies of the Page FISA applications and related memos that \nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN/FISA \n9 \nAuthorized for Public Release on: September 11, 2020  Page 9 of 21  FISC Opinion, Jun. 25, 2020\n\nFISA Titles I and III FISC Opinion Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN/FISA \ncontain PISA-acquired information,\" as well as notes and classified emails \n\"that may be responsive to this Judicial Watch FOIA request\" and might \ncontain PISA-acquired information.  Id. at 10-11. \n(2)  James Madison Project v. DOJ, No. 17-597 (D.D.C), in which the plaintiff \nchallenges  some of the redactions  in  publicly available versions  of the \nPage FISA applications and orders.  See Feb. 5, 2020, Resp. at 27. \nPage is not a party to either case.  The government has also mentioned, without identifying, \nongoing FOIA litigation regarding records of the former Special Counsel's Office (SCO), which \napparently also involves a record containing Page FISA information in minimized form.  See id. \natS-10. \nLitigation with third-party FOIA requesters does not fit into the previously recognized \nexception to §§ l 809(a)(2) and 1827(a)(2) for preventing or remedying unauthorized electronic \nsurveillance or physical search.  It is clear, however, that FOIA applies to records that an agency \nhas created or obtained and that are within its control when a FOIA request is made, see Grand \nCent. P'ship, Inc. v. Cuomo, 166 F.3d 473,479 (2d Cir. 1999), and that a requester may seek \ndistrict court review of whether records have been improperly withheld.  See 5 U.S.C. \n§ 552(a)(4)(B).  FOIA does not require disclosure of\"matters that are ... specifically exempted \nfrom disclosure by statute\" if the statute \"requires that the matters be withheld from the public in \nsuch a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue ... or refers to particular types of matters to \nbe withheld.\"  5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(3)(A). \nStatutes \"enacted after the date of enactment of the Open FOIA Act of 2009\" must also \n\"specifically cite[]\"§ 552(b)(3) to provide a basis for invoking this exemption from disclosure. \nSee§ 552(b)(3)(B).  But that citation requirement does not apply to§§ l 809(a)(2) and \n1827(a)(2).  The Open FOIA Act was enacted on October 28, 2009.  See Dep't of Homeland \nSecurity Appropriations Act, 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-83, § 564, 123 Stat. 2142, 2184 (2009). \nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN/FISA \n10 \nAuthorized for Public Release on: September 11, 2020  Page 10 of 21  FISC Opinion, Jun. 25, 2020\n\nFISA Titles I and III FISC Opinion Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN/FISA \nSection 1809(a)(2) was originally enacted in 1978, see FISA, Pub. L. No,. 95-511, § I 09(a)(2), \n92 Stat. 1783, 1796 (I 978), and since October 28, 2009, has only been amended to correct \npunctuation.  See Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-259, § \n801 (3), 124 Stat. 2654, 2746 (2010).  Section 1827(a)(2) was enacted in 1994 and has not been \namended.  See Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995, Pub. L. No. 103-359, § \n807(a)(3), 108 Stat. 3423, 3452 (1994). \nBecause FOIA exempts such infom1ation from disclosure, it does not necessarily conflict \nwith§§ 1809(a)(2) and 1827(a)(2) regarding whether the Page FISA information should be \ndisclosed to the third-party plaintiffs.  (Other FOIA exemptions may also apply.  See,~, \n§ 552(b)(6) (protecting against unwarranted invasion of personal privacy)).  But, as a practical \nmatter, that FOJA litigation could not proceed if§§ 1809(a)(2) and 1827(a)(2) were further \nunderstood, for example, to bar FBI and other DOJ personnel working on that litigation from \nusing or disclosing such information among themselves, insofar as it appears in documents \nresponsive to the pertinent FOIA requests. \nWhen different statutes apply to the same circumstances, a court \"is not at liberty to pick \nand choose among congressional enactments and must instead strive to give effect to both.\" \nEpic Sys. Corp. v. Lewis, 138 S. Ct. 1612, 1624 (2018) (quoting Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. \n535, 551 (1974)).  Accordingly, the Court construes the applicable statutes to permit use or \ndisclosure of Page FISA information insofar as necessary for the good-faith conduct of the \nabove-described third-party FOIA litigation.  The Court anticipates that any Page FISA \ninformation subject to use or disclosure in the context of such litigation, including within FBI \nand DOJ, will be limited to what is contained in the records responsive to the third-party FOIA \nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN/FISA \n11 \nAuthorized for Public Release on: September 11, 2020  Page 11 of 21  FISC Opinion, Jun. 25, 2020\n\nFISA Titles I and III FISC Opinion Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nrequests.  The Court also expects that the government will take into account the strictures of§§ \n1809(a)(2) and 1827(a)(2) in assessing what should be disclosed to the plaintiffs. \n2.  Page's Civil Litigation \nThe government advises that, on October 12, 2019, Page himself filed a complaint \nagainst DOJ alleging FOIA and Privacy Act violations, including that he was improperly denied \naccess to his own records.  See Feb. 5, 2020, Resp. at 26 (citing Page v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, \nNo. 19-3149 (D.D.C.)).  The Complaint alleges that on May 21, 2017, Page \"submitted requests \nto the DOJ, FBI and NSA under the Privacy and Freedom oflnfonnation Acts for copies of all \ninfonnation ... about himself' and requests that the district court order disclosure to Page of \n\"the previously requested records in their entireties,\" apparently in order to identify and \n\"expunge all records or information maintained by the DOJ that [are] inaccurate and/or \nderogatory\" to him.  See Complaint at 7, 9.  The government further reports that Page's attorneys \nhave advised DOJ of more claims that he may bring against the government, \"including \nviolations of the Patriot Act, FISA, the Privacy Act, and the Federal Tort Claims Act.\"  See Apr. \n17, 2020, Resp. at 8; Feb. 28, 2020, Resp. at 9. \nThe analysis set out above for the third-party FOIA litigation points to the same \nconclusion for Page v. U.S. Dep't of Justice:  it is permissible for the government to use or \ndisclose the Page FISA information insofar as necessary to its good-faith conduct of that \nlitigation.  The litigation with Page nonetheless presents circumstances notably different from \nthe third-party FOJA litigation.  First, the litigation with Page involves much more Page FISA \ninformation, including much if not all of the raw results of electronic surveillance and physical \nsearch targeting him.  Second, there may be reasonable arguments that§§ ! 809(a)(2) and \n1827(a)(2) should not be interpreted to prohibit disclosure of information in response to a \nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN/FISA \n12 \nAuthorized for Public Release on: September 11, 2020  Page 12 of 21  FISC Opinion, Jun. 25, 2020\n\nFISA Titles I and III FISC Opinion Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN/FISA \nrequest from the target of the unauthorized surveillance or search by which the information was \nobtained.  That issue should be resolved, if necessary, in the district court litigation. \nFinally, although the Comi cannot know the exact nature of claims that Page has not yet \nbrought, it is foreseeable that they may seek redress for alleged injury from the unauthorized \nsurveillance and search.  The FISC has previously found that \"Congress may be presumed not to \nhave prohibited actions that are necessary to mitigate or prevent the very banns at which Section \nI 809(a)(2) is addressed,\" see Dec. 10, 2010, Op. at 8 (emphasis in original, internal quotation \nmarks omitted), in order to avoid a result \"so absurd or glaringly unjust\" that it calls into \nquestion \"whether Congress actually intended what the plain language\" of§ I 809(a)(2) \nseemingly requires.  See May 13, 2011, Op. at 5 (quoting Rodgers, 466 U.S. at 484).  It would be \nsimilarly anomalous to interpret§§ I 809(a)(2) and I 827(a)(2) as impeding a target of unlawful \nsurveillance or search from pursuing civil remedies - ~, by preventing discovery of \nsurveillance information necessary to prove the existence or scope of the surveillance.  FISA \nitself, moreover, affords a cause of action to an aggrieved person who has \"been subjected to an \n[u nauthorized] electronic surveillance or about whom information obtained by electronic \nsurveillance of such person[s] has been disclosed or used in violation of'§ 1809.  See 50 U.S.C. \n§ 1810.  (A comparable civil-liability provision regarding unauthorized physical searches \nappears at § 1828.)  Interpreting FISA 's criminal prohibitions to hinder pursuit of its \ncomplementary civil remedies would violate the principle that\"[ s ]tatutes should be interpreted \nas a symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme.\" Mellouli v. Lynch, 575 U.S. 798, 135 S. Ct. \n1980, 1989 (2015) (quoting FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Com .. 529 U.S. 120, 133 \n(2000)).  The Court consequently concludes that§§ I 809(a)(2) and I 827(a)(2) do not prohibit \nuse or disclosure insofar as necessary for the good-faith conduct of litigation of any future claims \nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN/FISA \n13 \nAuthorized for Public Release on: September 11, 2020  Page 13 of 21  FISC Opinion, Jun. 25, 2020\n\nFISA Titles I and III FISC Opinion Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN/FISA \nbrought by Page seeking redress for unlawful surveillance and search or disclosure of the results \nof such surveillance and search. \n3.  Review of FBI Personnel's Conduct \nThe FBI's Inspection Division (INSD) has access to the Page investigative file in a \nstorage system called Sentinel.  See Apr. 17, 2020, Resp. at 17.  The government submits that \nINSD \"needs access to the case file as part of its review of the conduct of personnel involved in \nthe Page investigation.\"  Id.  That file contains, in minimized form, some information acquired \nnnder color of the above-captioned dockets.  INSD personnel have been instructed not to further \nuse or disclose snch information \"without discussing the matter with FBI's [Office of General \nCounsel (OGC)], whose personnel will notify NSD.\"  Id.  Previously, INSD received hard copies \nof the Page FISA renewal applications and associated Woods files, which also contain \nminimized FISA information.  See Feb. 5, 2020, Resp. at 7-8; Feb. 28, 2020, Resp. at 7 n.8.  It \nalso possesses in electronic form \"minimized, and potentially unminimized, information \nobtained pursuant to the authorities granted in the above dockets,\" which the government has not \nfurther described.  See Feb. 5, 2020, Resp. at 7. \nThe Court understands INSD's review to include a performance assessment of FBI \npersonnel's conduct of the Page investigation, as well as potentially an assessment of whether \ndisciplinary actions are appropriate for particular personnel.  See Corrected Op. and Order at 14-\n15, Misc. No. 19-02 (FISA Ct. Mar. 5, 2020).  The disciplinary assessment may also involve the \nFBI's Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR).  Id.  In the abstract, identifying deficient \nperformance and holding personnel accountable for misconduct in the FISA process plausibly \nfall within the previously recognized exception to §§ l 809(a)(2) and l 827(a)(2) for use and \ndisclosure to prevent unauthorized surveillance or search.  But the Court has emphasized that the \nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN/FISA \n14 \nAuthorized for Public Release on: September 11, 2020  Page 14 of 21  FISC Opinion, Jun. 25, 2020\n\nFISA Titles I and III FISC Opinion Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN/FISA \nexception applies only when nse or disclosure of specific information is necessary for such a \npurpose.  See May 13,2011, Op. at 4-7.  The FISC in that case sought to delineate the exception \nnarrowly because it is \"for Congress to resolve the pros and cons of whether a statute should \nsweep broadly or narrowly.\"  Id. at 5 (quoting Rodgers, 466 U.S. at 484).  The court was also \nmindful that it \"should not attempt to restrict the unqualified language of a [c riminal] statute to \nthe particular evil that Congress was trying to remedy-even assuming that it is possible to \nidentify that evil from something other than the text of the statute itself.\"  Id. (quoting Brogan v. \nUnited States, 522 U.S. 398, 403 (I 998)).  hi that case, the National Security Agency sought to \nuse the results of a particular unauthorized surveillance for auditing or \"other aspects of an \nenterprise-wide compliance program.\"  Id. at 7.  The FISC held that the exception did not apply \nbecause \"the specific over-collected information at issue no longer ha[d] any distinctive utility \nfor NSA's compliance efforts.\"  Id. (emphasis added).  Accordingly, it was \"neither absurd, nor \nglaringly unjust, nor obviously at variance with the policy of FISA as whole\" to hold the \ngovernment to the plain meaning of§ 1809(a)(2).  Id. \nApplying those standards to this case, the Court is satisfied that effective performance or \ndisciplinary reviews of the relevant FBI personnel require access to records such as the Page \ncase file and applications, including the relatively limited and presumably minimized FISA \ninformation therein.  The same cannot be said of access to the entire body of Page FISA \ninformation retained in raw form, much of which presumably was not found to be relevant to the \ninvestigation.  It is possible, however, that such reviews may legitimately require use or \ndisclosure of specific raw information - ~, if the contents of raw information accessed by a \nparticular employee at a certain time are important to evaluating the employee's conduct.  The \nCourt therefore concludes that use or disclosure of raw information in the context of such \nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN/FISA \n15 \nAuthorized for Public Release on: September 11, 2020  Page 15 of 21  FISC Opinion, Jun. 25, 2020\n\nFISA Titles I and III FISC Opinion Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nreviews is permissible only when a particular need has been demonstrated to use or disclose \nspecific infotmation. \n4.  Ongoing DOJ OIG Oversight \nDOJ OIG is in possession of materials that contain \"a limited amount\" of Page FISA \ninformation: \"I) each of the three renewal applications,\" including drafts; \"2) the accuracy sub \nfile, or Woods File, for each renewal application; and 3) e-mail communications of FBI \npersonnel who were assigned to the Crossfire Hurricane investigation and (DOJ National \nSecurity Division (NSD)] personnel who were involved with the Page applications.\"  Feb. 5, \n2020, Resp. at 18.  OIG also received copies of documents from such NSD personnel and of \nemails and documents from others within NSD who received information about the Page \ninvestigation; \"[i]t is possible that some of these documents and emails ... may have included \nminimized summaries\" of some of the Page FISA information.  Id. at 15-16. \nOIG finalized its report and concluded its investigation of the FBI's handling of the Page \nFISA applications on December 8, 2019.  See Dec. 9, 2019, Letter at 20.  Nonetheless, OIG is \nmonitoring implementation of the recommendations in its report and responding to questions \nfrom members of Congress (which the government represents will not involve disclosure of any \nPage FISA information).  See Feb. 5, 2020, Resp. at 20.  OIG is also engaged in \"an audit of the \nFBI's compliance with its Woods Procedures in FISA applications relating to U.S. persons.\"  Id. \nMost of the OIG's recommendations are systemic.  See OIG Report at 414-17.  The only \none for which the Page PISA information could be relevant is Recommendation 9:  that the \"FBI \nshould review the perfo1mance of all employees who had responsibility for the preparation, \nWoods review, or approval of the FISA applications (for Page], as well as the managers, \nsupervisors, and senior officials in the chain of command of the Carter Page investigation.\"  Id. \nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN/FISA \n16 \nAuthorized for Public Release on: September 11, 2020  Page 16 of 21  FISC Opinion, Jun. 25, 2020\n\nFISA Titles I and III FISC Opinion Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nat 417.  Some use or disclosure of Page PISA information may be permissible during such a \nreview, see supra pp. 14-16, and the same reasoning extends to OIG's monitoring of its related \nrecommendation.  It is difficult to see how information about Page's private communications \nand activities could be relevant to assessing implementation of the other recommendations.  And \nit is a stretch to think that information from unauthorized search and surveillance of one target \nwill bear on evaluating the FBI's compliance with accuracy procedures in working on \napplications for unrelated targets.  As a result, the Court finds that further use or disclosure of \nPage PISA information by OIG is permissible only insofar as necessary to its assessment of the \nimplementation of Recommendation 9. \n5.  Ongoing Criminal Investigations and Potential Prosecutions \nAt the direction of the Attorney General, John H. Durham, the United States Attorney for \nthe District of Connecticut, is leading \"a review of intelligence activities relating to campaigns in \nthe 2016 U.S. Presidential election and certain related matters.\"  Feb. 5, 2020, Resp. at 24-25 \n(internal quotation marks omitted).  That review \"includes an investigation of the actions of \ngovernment officials related to Carter Page generally and the decision to seek and continue \nmonitoring him pursuant to PISA specifically.\"  Id. at 25.  It also encompasses a criminal \ninvestigation based on OIG's referral of actions taken by an FBI attorney in connection with the \nlast Page application.  The attorney altered the contents of a communication from another agency \nabout Page's prior reporting relationship with the agency before forwarding it to the FBI agent \nwho swore to the facts in the application.  Id. at 25; OIG Report at 254-56. \nDurham's team has received copies of the emails produced to OIG (see supra p. 16) and \npossesses \"copies ofFBI's Woods files for the Page PISA applications and other FBI documents \nthat likely contain PISA-acquired information,\" as well as \"handwritten notes and other \nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN/FISA \n17 \nAuthorized for Public Release on: September 11, 2020  Page 17 of 21  FISC Opinion, Jun. 25, 2020\n\nFISA Titles I and III FISC Opinion Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN/FISA \ndocuments from FBI and SCO personnel\" that may do so.  See Feb. 5, 2020, Resp. at 21. \nDurham's team does \"not have access to unminimized PISA-acquired information from the \nabove dockets in FBI systems\"; however, members of the team \"who are FBI personnel have \naccess to the records related to [the Page] case in FBI's Sentinel system.\"  Id.  (Sentinel includes \nthe Page investigative files, which contain some Page FISA information in minimized form.  See \nsupra p. 14.)  FBI team members also have access to copies of certain electronic communications \nof FBI personnel, which they can share with other team members.  See Feb. 5, 2020, Resp. at 21-\n22.  Those communications could include some Page FISA information.  Id. \nBeyond what has already been received, \"U.S. Attorney Durham has requested that \ninformation relevant to specific criminal referral [regarding the \nFBI attorney] ... be preserved during the pendency \"  Id. at 26.  In the \ngovernment's view, \"FISA information acquired ... [by] targeting Page ... [and] retained in any \nform\" is relevant Id. \nIt also posits that \"[i]t is possible that\" Page FISA information \"may be \nrelevant to any ongoing investigation or resolution\" of the criminal referral because it \"may (I) \nconstitute or relate to evidence of improper and/or criminal conduct committed by the FBI \nattorney and/or (ii) constitute Jencks Act material, Brady \nmaterial, or otherwise discoverable material relevant to a subject's defense, for example, on the \nissue of materiality.\"  Id. at 25-26 (footnotes omitted, emphasis added).  The government thus \nanticipates that such information may be used affirmatively to prove its case or be subject to \nobligations of disclosure to the defense. \nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN/FISA \n18 \nAuthorized for Public Release on: September 11, 2020  Page 18 of 21  FISC Opinion, Jun. 25, 2020\n\nFISA Titles I and III FISC Opinion Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN/FISA \nIn addition to prohibiting use or disclosure of the results of unauthorized electronic \nsurveillance and physical search, § § 1809 and 1827 make it a criminal offense under certain \ncircumstances to intentionally engage in unauthorized electronic surveillance or physical search. \nSee supra p. 3.  Sections 1809 and 1827 would be self-defeating if they were interpreted to \nprohibit use or disclosure of such information, even when necessary to investigate and prosecute \nthe very crimes they define.  Beyond that, investigating and prosecuting other offenses that arise \nfrom misconduct by government personnel in the FISA process should deter future unauthorized \nsurveillance and search, which may permit related uses or disclosures if needed for the \npreviously recognized exception to the prohibition.  See supra pp. 4-5, 14-15. \nThe government has not shown, however, that all of the Page FISA information is \nnecessary to investigate or prosecute such violations.  Certain materials, such as the Page \ninvestigative file, appear relevant to evaluating the conduct of FBI personnel during that \ninvestigation, but, taken as a whole, the larger body ofun-minimized search and surveillance \nresults does not.  See supra p. 15.  For purposes of the Durham team's work, one would also \nreasonably expect that relevant FISA information would be found in minimized form in the Page \ninvestigative file in Sentinel or in communications among FBI and NSD personnel responsible \nfor that investigation, but the need for general access to the entire mass of Page FISA \ninfonnation retained in raw form on FBI storage systems has not been demonstrated.  The Court, \nconsequently, finds that use or disclosure of raw Page FISA information for the purpose of \ninvestigating or prosecuting potential crimes relating to the conduct of the Page or Crossfire \nHurricane investigations is permissible only insofar as a particular need has been demonstrated \nto use or disclose specific information. \nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN/FISA \n19 \nAuthorized for Public Release on: September 11, 2020  Page 19 of 21  FISC Opinion, Jun. 25, 2020\n\nFISA Titles I and III FISC Opinion Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN/FISA \nIll.  Conclusion \nNeither the government nor the Court is free to depart from the plain meaning of \n§§ l 809(a)(2) and l 827(a)(2) simply to facilitate actions thought to be reasonable, or even \nlaudable.  With regard to reviewing the conduct of government personnel and prosecuting any \ncriminal violations by them, the Court is permitting use or disclosure of information obtained \nfrom electronic surveillance or physical search of Page only where it has been or can be \ndemonstrated to be necessary to remedy or deter the types of harm at which§§ 1809 and 1827 \nare addressed. \nFor the reasons stated above, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED as follows: \n(I) With regard to the third-party FOIA litigation, see supra pp. 9-10, and the pending \nlitigation with Page, see supra p. 12, the government may use or disclose Page FISA information \ninsofar as necessary for the good-faith conduct of that litigation; \n(2) With regard to any future claims brought by Page seeking redress for unlawful \nelectronic surveillance or physical search or for disclosure of the results of such surveillance or \nsearch, the government may use or disclose Page FISA information insofar as necessary to the \ngood-faith conduct of the litigation of such claims; \n(3) Further use or disclosure of Page FISA information is permitted insofar as necessary \nto effective performance or disciplinary reviews of government personnel, provided that any \nsuch use or disclosure of raw information is permitted only insofar as a particular need to use or \ndisclose the specific information at issue has been demonstrated.  This paragraph applies, but is \nnot limited to, use by, and disclosure by or to, the FBI's INSD or OPR; \n(4) Further use or disclosure of Page FISA information by DOJ OIG is permitted only \ninsofar as necessary to assess the implementation of Recommendation 9 of the OIG Report; \nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN/FISA \n20 \nAuthorized for Public Release on: September 11, 2020  Page 20 of 21  FISC Opinion, Jun. 25, 2020\n\nFISA Titles I and III FISC Opinion Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\n \n(5) Further use or disclosure of Page FISA information is permitted only insofar as \nnecessary to investigate or prosecute potential crimes relating to the conduct of the Page or \nCrossfire Hurricane investigations, provided that any such use or disclosure of raw information \nis permitted only insofar as a particular need to use or disclose the specific information at issue \nhas been demonstrated.  This paragraph applies, but is not limited to, use by, and disclosure by \nor to, personnel engaged in the review being lead by United States Attorney Durham.  See supra \np.17;and \n(6) By January 29, 2021, and at intervals of no more than six months thereafter, the \ngovernment shall submit under oath a written report on the retention, and any use or disclosure, \nof Page FISA information. \nENTERED this ~day of June, 2020. \nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN/FISA \n21 \nAuthorized for Public Release on: September 11, 2020  Page 21 of 21  FISC Opinion, Jun. 25, 2020",

PAGE,  Docket Nos: 16-1182, 17-52, 17-375, \n17-679 \nA U.S. PERSON \nORDER REGARDING FURTHER DISCLOSURES OF INFORMATION \nThe government has reported disclosures of information acquired by electronic \nsurveillance and physical search conducted under the above-captioned dockets (\"Page FTSA \ninformation\") to the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Missouri (USAO-\nMOE) and the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia (USAO-DC). See \nThird Supplemental Resp. to the Ct.'s Order Dated Jan. 7, 2020, Nos. 16-1182, 17-52, 17-375, \n17-679, at 4-12 (Oct. 21, 2020). It has also described actual and anticipated disclosure of such \ninformation to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. See id. at 18-19. \nThe Court conducted a hearing regarding the disclosures to the USAO-MOE and USAO-\nDC on November 6, 2020.  On November 13, 2020, the government reported to the Court the \nsteps it is taking to ensure that the USAO-MOE and USAO-DC either destroy materials in their \npossession that contain Page FISA information or return them to the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation. See Letter, Nos. 16-1182, 17-52, 17-375, 17-679, at 1-3 (Nov. 13, 2020).  Should \nthe USAO-MOE or USAO-DC seek renewed access to such materials thereafter, it will seek \nCourt approval before obtaining them from the FBI.  See id. at 4. \n\nThe Court finds those measures, and the government's timetable for implementing them, \nto be reasonable.  It also finds disclosure of Page FISA information to the Senate Committee on \nthe Judiciary, under the circumstances described by the government, to be consistent with the \nparameters for disclosure previously established by the Court.  See Op. and Order Regarding Use \nand Disclosure of Information, Nos. 16-1182, 17-52, 17-375, 17-679, at 20-21 (FISA Ct. June \n25, 2020). \nAccordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED as follows: \n(1) The government shall take the steps described in the November 13, 2020, Letter to \ndispossess the USAO-MOE and USAO-DC of Page FJSA information; \n(2) By December 21, 2020, the government shall report to the Court in writing regarding \nthe completion of those steps; and \n(3) The USAO-MOE and USAO-DC shall not access materials returned to the FBI, as \ndescribed in the  ovember 13, 2020, Letter, without the prior approval of the Court. \nENTERED this J:f..tday of November, 2020. \n-2-",

The  Election \nSecurity  Joint  Statement  stated  that,  based  on  the  scope  and  sensitivity  of these \nefforts,  only  Russia’s  senior-most  officials  could  have  authorized  these activities. \nMore  recently,  on  December  29,  2016,  the  White  House  issued  a  statement  that  the \nU.S.  President had  ordered  a  number  of  actions  in  response  to  the  Russian \nGovernment's  aggressive  harassment  of U.S.  officials  and  cyber  operations  aimed  at \nthe  U.S.  election.

Although  the  Report  is  unclassified,  a  classified \nappendix  to  the  Report  includes  information  collected  pursuant  to  the  Page  FISAs  in  three \nparagraphs.

(U)  BACKGROUND \n(U)  On  December  9,  2019,  the  DOJ  Office  of the  Inspector  General  (OIG)  released  a \nreport  titled,  Review  of Four  FISA  Applications  and  Other  Aspects  of the  FBI's  Crossfire \nHurricane  Investigation  (the  OIG  Report),  which  detailed  material  omissions  and  misstatements \nwith  respect  to  the  Page  FISAs.'  As  set  forth  therein,  DOJ  assessed  that  at  least  as  of the  time  of \nthe  third  and  fourth  applications  targeting  Page  in  docket  numbers  17-375  and  17-679,  if not \nearlier,  there  was  insufficient  predication  to  establish  probable  cause  to  believe  that  Page  was \nacting  as  an  agent  of a  foreign  power.  On  January  7,  2020,  the  Court  ordered  the  Government  to \nprovide  information  regarding  the  handling  and  disposition of  information  acquired  pursuant  to \nthe  Page  FISAs,  and  an  explanation  as  to  why  the  retention  of such  information,  and  any \ncontemplated  use  or disclosure  of it,  comports  with  Sections  1801(h)(1),  1809(a)(2),  1821(4)(A), \n'(U)  See  also  letters  submitted  by  the Government  pursuant  to  Rule  13(a)  of the Court’s  Rules of \nProcedure  dated  July  12,  2018,  October 25,  2019,  November 27,  2019  and  December  9,  2019. \n2 \nEDACTED / CLEARED  FOR PUBLIC RELEASE\nREDACTED  / CLEARED  FOR PUBLIC  RELEASE \nand  1827(a)(2)  of FISA.2  The  Government  filed an  initial  Response  on  February  5,  2020 \n(February  5  Response),  and  three  Supplemental  Responses  on  February  28  (February  28 \nResponse),  April  17,  2020  (April  17  Response),  and  October  21,  2020  (October  21  Response). \n(U)  On  June  25,  2020,  the  Court  issued  an  Opinion  and  Order  Regarding the  Use  and \nDisclosure of Information  obtained  or derived  om  the  Page  FISAs,  which  found  that  the \ncriminal  provisions  in  Sections  1809(a)(2)  and  1827(a)(2)  applied  to  the use  or  disclosure  of \ninformation  acquired  from  the  above  dockets.2  Beginning  with  a previously  recognized \nexception  to  Sections  1809(a)(2)  and  1827(a)(2)  for  actions  necessary  to  mitigate  or  prevent  the \nvery  harms  those  sections  are  designed  to  address,  the  Court  set  parameters  for  the  use  or \ndisclosure  of Page  FISA  information  in  five  limited  circumstances  described  by  the  Government \nand  analyzed  by  the  Court.’  Of particular  relevance  here,  the  fifth  circumstance  authorized  the \n2  (U)  It  is  a  criminal  offense  to  “intentionally”  engage  in “electronic  surveillance  under color  of law \nexcept as  authorized  by”  statute,  or disclose “information  obtained  under color of law by electronic \nsurveillance,  knowing  or having reason  to know that the  information  was  obtained through  electronic \nsurveillance”  that  had  not  been  properly  authorized.  §  1809(a).  It  is  similarly  an  offense  to  intentionally \nconduct  a  physical  search  under color of law  within the  United  States to  obtain  foreign  intelligence \ninformation “except as  authorized  by  statute,” or to  intentionally  disclose  or use  information  obtained  by \nsuch  a  search  “knowing  or having reason  to  know that the  information was  obtained through  physical \nsearch  not authorized  by  statute  [...].”  §  1827(a). \n3(U)  The  Office of the  Director of National  Intelligence,  in  consultation  with  DOJ  and  the  FBI, \npublically  released  a  declassified  and  redacted  version  of the Court’s  Opinion  on  September  |  1,  2020. \nThe  publically  released  Opinion  can  be  found  at \nhttps://www. intelligence. gov/assets/documents/702%20Documents/declassified/June_2020_F ISC_Opinio \nn.pdf \n4(U)  More specifically,  following  its  analysis of applicable  FBI  minimization  procedures  as  required  by \nFISA  (Sections  1801(h)(1)  and  1821(a)(2)),  as  well  as  Sections  1809(a)(2)  and  1827(a)(2)  and  certain \nlimited  exceptions  to  those  criminal  provisions  of the Act,  the  Court  set parameters  for the  use  or \ndisclosure  of Page  FISA  information  in the  following  five  circumstances:  (1)  certain  identified  ongoing \nthird-party  litigation  pursuant  to  the  Freedom of Information  Act  (FOIA);  (2)  ongoing  and \nanticipated  FOIA  and  civil  litigation  with  Page;  (3)  FBI  review of the  conduct  of its  personnel \ninvolved  in  the  Page  investigation;  (4)  DOJ  OIG  monitoring of the  implementation  of one of  the \n3 \nREDACTED  /  CLEARED  FOR  PUBLIC  RELEASE\nREDACTED  / CLEARED  FOR PUBLIC RELEASE \nuse  or  disclosure  of Page  FISA  information  “as  necessary  to  investigate  or  prosecute  potential \ncrimes  relating  to  the  conduct  of the  Page  or  Crossfire  Hurricane  investigations,”  and  noted  that \nthis  paragraph  applied  to,  but  was  not  limited  to,  “the  review  being  lead  by  United  States \nAttorney  Durham.”  /d.  at  21.  The  Court  also  required  that  the  Government  file  a  written  report \non  the  retention,  use,  or  disclosure  of Page  FISA  information  every  six  months  (the  Semi-Annual \nReports).  Id. \n(U)  In  the  January  27,  2023  Semi-Annual  Report,  the  Government  advised  that  Special \nCounsel  Durham  was  concluding  his  investigation  and  would  likely  be  sharing  Page  FISA \ninformation  with  Government  agencies  for  the  purposes  of vetting  a  draft  memorandum,  but  that \nthe  Government  would  inform  the  Court  if the  final  memorandum  included  Page  FISA \ninformation  before  it  was  made  public.  Special  Counsel  Durham  has  produced  an  unclassified \nreport  and  a classified  appendix  to  the  report,  and  limited  Page  FISA  information  is  included  in \nthe  classified  appendix.  In  particular,  limited  Page  FISA  information  is  described  in  sections  of \nthe  classified  appendix  addressing  how  the  FBI  assessed,  explained,  or  excluded  potentially \nrelevant  information  from  the  Page  FISA  applications.  The  unclassified  report  and  classified \nappendix  have  been  provided  by  Special  Counsel  Durham  to  the  Attorney  General  and  Office  of \nthe  Deputy  Attorney  General.  The  unclassified  report  was  publicly  released  on  May  15,  2023. \n(eae  ee  On  page  25  of the  Classified  Appendix,  one  paragraph  refers  toa \ncommunication  involving  Page  made  in  2016.  That  communication  was  publicly  discussed  in \npart during  Page’s  testimony  before  the  United  States  House  Permanent  Select  Committee  on \nrecommendations  (Recommendation  9)  stemming  from  the  OIG  Report;  and  (5)  the  investigation \nand  prosecution  of Government  personnel  relating  to  the  Crossfire  Hurricane  investigations.  Jd.  at \n20-21. \n4 \nREDACTED / CLEARED FOR PUBLIC  RELEASE\nREDACTED  / CLEARED  FOR PUBLIC  RELEASE \nIntelligence  (HPSCI)  on November 2017,  and  is  quoted  in  the  publicly  available  United  States \nSenate  Select  Committee  on  Intelligence’s  (SSCI)  Report  on  Russian Active  Measures \nCampaigns  and Interference  in  the  2016  U.S.  Election,  vol.  5,  at  549  (SSCl  Report).  The \nClassified  Appendix  refers  to  FBI  assessments  discussed  in  the  first  Page  renewal  application \nbased  on  this  communication  and  also  discusses  information  the  communication did  not  contain. \nThe  other  paragraphs  that  refer  to  Page  FISA  information  are  on  pages  28-29  of the  Classified \niI.  (U)  PROPOSED  PARAMETERS  FOR  USE  OR  DISCLOSURE  OF  THE \nLIMITED  PAGE  FISA  INFORMATION  IN  THE  CLASSIFIED  APPENDIX \n(U)  While  the  Report  has  been  publicly  released,  the  unredacted  version  of the  classified \nappendix  will  only  be  disclosed  within  the  executive  branch  to  the  Office  of the  Attorney \nGeneral  (OAG)  and  the  Office  of the  Deputy  Attorney  General  (ODAG),  which  have supervisory \nauthority  over  the  investigation  led  by  Special  Counsel  Durham;  the  Office  of the  Director  and \nDeputy  Director  of the  FBI,  who  have  a  need  to  understand  the  decisions  made  by  Special \nCounsel  Durham  in  his  report,  and  the  implications  to  the  FBI  of those  decisions,  including  if \nthey  are  relevant as  part  of any  potential  disciplinary  review;  and  senior  officials  in  the \nDepartment’s  Office  of the  Inspector  General  (OIG),  who  have  oversight  responsibilities  for  the \nDepartment,  including  the  authority  to  initiate  criminal  investigations  based  on allegations  of \nwrongdoing.° \n(U)  Additionally,  the  Government  proposes  keeping  copies  of the  unredacted  classified \nappendix  stored  in  a  U.S.  Government  Sensitive  Compartmented  Information  Facility  (SCIF)  so \n5  (U)  In  addition,  limited  personnel  within  DOJ’s National  Security  Division  (NSD)  were  provided  a \nfinal  draft  copy of the classified  appendix  in  order to  prepare  this  motion. \n5 \nREDACTED  /  CLEARED  FOR  PUBLIC  RELEASE\nREDACTED  / CLEARED  FOR PUBLIC  RELEASE \nthat  the  Page  FISA  information  can  be  shared  with  select  members  of Congress  with  oversight \nresponsibility  for  FISA.  In  particular,  the  Government  recommends  that  members  and  limited \nstaff of HPSCI,  SSCI,  the  United  States  Senate  Committee  on  the  Judiciary  (SJC),  the  House \nJudiciary  Committee,  and  the  Gang  of Eight®  be  given  restricted  access  to  the  unredacted \nClassified  Appendix.  To  ensure  that  the  document  is  not  further  used  or  disclosed  while  retained \nin  the  U.S.  Government  SCIE,  it  will  be  kept  secure  with  access  only  to  those  individuals  needed \nto  facilitate  the  review  described  above.  Additionally,  the  above  individuals  will  be  able  to  view, \nbut  not  remove,  copy,  or duplicate  the  document. \nII.  (U)  THE  PROPOSED  LIMITED  USE  AND  DISCLOSURE  OF  PAGE  FISA \nMATERIAL  IS  CONSISTENT  WITH  SECTIONS  1801(h)(1),  1809(a)(2), \n1821(4)(A),  AND  1827(a)(2)  OF  FISA \n(U)  In  its  June  25,  2020  Order,  the  Court  considered  the  permissibility  of the \nGovernment’s  ongoing  retention,  use  and  disclosure  of the  Page  FISA  information  in  the  five \nlimited  circumstances  described  above.  Regarding  retention,  the  Court  noted  that  neither \nSections  1802(h)(1)  and  1821(4)(A),  nor  the  FBI’s  underlying  minimization  procedures, \nexplicitly  required  destruction.  Nonetheless,  the  Court  noted  that  it  has  previously  ordered  the \ndestruction  of information  obtained  through  unauthorized  electronic  surveillance and/or  physical \nsearch  absent  some  permissible  form  of use  or disclosure.  June  25,  2020  Order  at  7.  The  Court \nultimately  concluded  that  ‘some  permissible  forms  of use  and  disclosure  of Page  FISA \ninformation”  were  reasonably  anticipated  and,  accordingly,  did  not  order  the  destruction  of the \n6  (U)  Pursuant  to  50  U.S.C.  §  3093(c)(2),  under “extraordinary  circumstances” the  President  is  entitled  to \nlimit  access  to  certain  intelligence  information  to  eight  members  of Congress:  the  leaders  of each of the \ntwo  parties  from  both  the House  of Representatives  and  the  Senate  as  well  as  the  chair  and  ranking \nminority  members  of HPSCI  and  SSCI. \n6 \nREDACTED / CLEARED  FOR PUBLIC  RELEASE\nREDACTED  /  CLEARED  FOR  PUBLI \nPage  FISA  information.  /d.  The  Government  submits  that the  limited  sharing  described  supra \nalso  constitutes  permissible  forms  of use  and  disclosure  of Page  FISA  information. \n(U)  First,  the  disclosure  of the  unredacted  classified  appendix  to  OAG,  ODAG,  the \nOffice  of the  Director  and  Deputy  Director  of the  FBI,  and  OIG  logically  falls  within  the  fifth \ncategory  set  forth  in  the  June  25,  2020  Order.  There,  the  Court  set parameters  for  the  use  or \ndisclosure  of Page  FISA  information  “as  necessary  to  investigate  or  prosecute  potential  crimes \nrelating  to  the  conduct of the  Page  or  Crossfire  Hurricane  investigations...”  Id.  at  21.  The  Court \nnoted  that,  “[tJhis  paragraph  applies,  but  is  not  limited  to,  use  by,  and  disclosure  by  or to, \npersonnel  engaged  in  the  review  being  lead  [sic]  by  United  States  Attomey  Durham.”  Jd.  An \nend  of investigation  report  is  an  integral  part  of an  investigation,  as  it  explains  the  investigative \nfindings  and  prosecutorial  decisions  of the  investigative  team.  Special  Counsel  Durham  has \nadvised  that  the  Page  FISA  information  included  in  the  classified  appendix  is  necessary  to \nunderstand  his  findings  and  decisions.  Because  OAG  and  ODAG  have  supervisory  authority \nover  the  investigation,  the  FBI  Office  of the  Director  and  Deputy  Director  need  to  understand  the \nimplications  of Special  Counsel  Durham’s  decisions,  including  if relevant  to potential \ndisciplinary  reviews,  and  the  OIG  has  oversight  authority  over  the  Department,’  disclosure  of \n7(U)  The  Government assesses  that the  disclosure  of the  limited  Page FISA  information  in the  Classified \nAppendix to the  OIG  is  consistent  with  both  categories 4  and  5  of the Court’s June  25,  2020  Order.  June \n25,  2020  Order at  20-21.  For  example,  category  $  applies to disclosures  necessary to  investigate  or \nprosecute  potential  crimes relating to  the conduct of the  Page  or Crossfire  Hurricane  investigations.  Jd.  at \n21.  Some  of the  sub-parts of recommendations  from  the  O1G’s  investigation  and  report  remain  open.  In \naddition,  category  4  of the June  25,  2020  Order permits  use  or disclosure  as  necessary  to  assess  the \nimplementation  of Recommendation  9  of the  OIG  report.  /d.at  20.  Recommendation  9  stated  that the \n\"FBI  should  review the  performance of all  employees  who  had  responsibility  for the  preparation,  Woods \nreview,  or approval  of the  FISA  applications  [for  Page],  as  well  as  the  managers,  supervisors,  and  senior \nofficials  in  the  chain  of command of the  Carter  Page  investigation.”  Jd.  The  limited  Page  FISA \ninformation  described  in  sections  of the  Classified  Appendix  appears  to have  been  included  for the \n7 \nREDACTED  /  CLEARED  FOR  PUBLIC  RELEASE\n  \nPage  FISA  information  to  certain  individuals  in  these  components  comports  with  the  parameters \nset  forth  in  the  June  25,  2020  Order. \n(U)  Second,  although  not  expressly  authorized by  the  June  25,  2020  Order,  the \nGovernment  believes  that  sharing  the  unredacted  classified  appendix  with  the  members  of \nCongress  who  have  oversight  responsibility  for  FISA,  the  FBI,  and  the  Department  of Justice \n(DOJ)  is  consistent  with  the  FISA  statute.  The  Government  recognizes  that  it  is  “not  free  to \ndepart  from  the  plain  meaning  of  §§  1809(a)(2)  and  1827(a)(2)  simply  to  facilitate  actions  thought \nto  be  reasonable,  or  even  laudable”  and  that  the  Court  has  limited  use  or  disclosure  of Page  FISA \ninformation “only  where  it  has  been  or  can  be  demonstrated  to  be  necessary  to  remedy  or  deter \nthe  types  of harm  at  which  §§  1809  and  1827  are  addressed.”  Jd.  at  20.  However,  the \nGovernment  has  previously  notified  the  Court  of the  disclosure  of Page  FISA  material  to \nCongress  under  the  exception  articulated  in  the  June  25,  2020  Order.  As  reported  in  the  October \n21  Response,  the  Government  explained  that  the  FBI  was  sharing  Page  FISA  information  with \nSJC,  which  was  investigating  the  conduct  of Government  personnel  involved  in  the  Crossfire \nHurricane  investigation.  In  particular,  the  Government  noted  that  SJC’s  Chief Investigative \nCounsel  had  been  provided  a  document  that  contained  Page  FISA  information,  and  that  the  FBI \nanticipated  that  witnesses  called  before  SJC  would  be  required  to  orally  disclose  Page  FISA \ninformation  in  response  to  questions  posed  by  the  committee.  As  explained  in  the  October  21 \npurpose  of addressing how  the  FBI  assessed,  explained,  or excluded  potentially  relevant  information  from \nthe  Page  FISA  applications.  To  the  extent  this  represents  new  information  to  the OIG  regarding how the \nFBI  personnel  assessed,  explained,  or  excluded  potentially  relevant information  from the  Page  FISA \napplications,  it  touches  on  the  performance  of FBI  personne!  who  prepared  the  applications,  which would \nbe  relevant to  recommendation  9  of the  OJG  report. \n8 \nREDACTED /  CLEARED  FOR PUBLIC  RELEASE\n  \n  2   PUDLIC  RELEASE \nResponse,  such  disclosures  to  SJC  were  consistent  with  the  parameters  for  the  use  or disclosure \nof Page  FISA  information  set  forth  in  the  June  25,  2020  Order. \n(U)  While  there  are  not any  active  investigations  by  Congress  into  Crossfire Hurricane, \nCongress  performs  ongoing  oversight  of the  FBI,  DOJ,  and  the  Government’s  use  of its  FISA \nauthority.  See  50  U.S.C.  §  1871.  To  the  extent  that  the  classified  appendix  provides additional \ndetails  about  how  the  Government  has  exercised  its  authority under the  FISA  statute,  that \ninformation  is  clearly  vital  to  the  Congressional  oversight  function.  Indeed,  the  understanding  of \nprecisely  what  went  wrong  during  Crossfire  Hurricane  will  inform  how  Congress  proceeds  in \nattempting to  prevent  future unauthorized  collections  and  violations  of §§  1809  and  1827.8 \nMoreover,  even  if the  oversight  committees  do  not  reopen  their  prior  investigations  into \nCrossfire  Hurricane  based  on  information  contained  in  the  classified  appendix,  future  hearings \nrelated  to  FISA  may  involve  discussion  of the  Crossfire  Hurricane  investigation  and  the  issues \nwith  the  Page  FISA  applications.?  Accordingly,  it  is  incumbent  upon  the  Government  to  provide \n8  (U)  If the Government does  not proactively  provide  access to  the classified  appendix  to  facilitate  this \noversight  responsibility,  it  is  likely  that  Congress  will  attempt to  compel  production  of the classified \nappendix through  other  means.  On  May  16, 2023,  the Attomey General  received a letter  from  HPSC] \nrequesting  the  transmittal  of the  classified  appendix,  noting that  pursuant  to  “House  Rule  X, the \nCommittee  has jurisdiction  over all  intelligence  and  intelligence-related  activities  of the  departments  and \nagencies of the  U.S.  government”  and  advising  that  if the classified  appendix  is  not  produced  in  an \n“expeditious  and  satisfactory  manner,  you  should  expect the  Committee  to use  its  additional tools and \nauthorities to  satisfy  our  legislative  and  oversight  requirements.”  See  Letter to  the Attorney General from \nHPSCI Chairman  Michael R.  Turner  and Ranking  Member James A.  Himes. \n°(U)  For  example,  in  the April  27,  2023  Hearing,  “Fixing  FISA:  How  a  law  designed  to  Protect \nAmericans  Has  Been  Weaponized  Against Them” held  by  the  United  States  House J udiciary \nSubcommittee on  Crime  and  Federal  Government  Surveillance,  the  opening  statement  by  Chairman  Andy \nBiggs  categorized  Crossfire  Hurricane  as a  “pretext  to  illegally  spy  on Trump campaign  associates” \nduring the  2016  campaign,  as  recorded  in  a  video  available  at  https://judiciary.house.gov/committee- \nactivity/hearings/fixing-fisa-how-law-designed-protect-americans-has-been-weaponized. \n9 \nRPEENDAA CTED / CALL EAREEADR EN FOEO D  PIRI LIItC  PEI REELEAASE \na  fulsome and  accurate  record  of its  investigations  into  the  conduct  of Government personnel. \nCongressional  committees  with  direct  FISA  oversight  authority  need  access  to  the  Government’s \ninvestigations  of Crossfire  Hurricane  so  they  can  make  informed  decisions  on  whether  additional \nreforms  or  remedial  measures are  needed.  The  Government  believes  that  the  limited'°  sharing  of \nthe  Page  FISA  information  in  the  classified  appendix,  some  of which  was  already  referred  to  in \nthe  public  version  of the  SSCI  Report,  to  select  members  of Congress  and  their  staff will \nultimately  help  prevent  the  types  of harms  at  which  Sections  1809  and  1827  are  addressed,  and \ntherefore  meets  the  implicit  exception  to  those  statutes  recognized  by  this  Court. \n10  (U)  As  described supra, the  parameters  for disclosure of  the  Page  FISA  information  recommended  by \nthe  Government  were  designed  to  prevent any  further disclosure  of the material.  The classified  appendix \nwould  be  retained  in  restricted  access  in  a  U.S.  Government  SCIF,  and  members  of Congress and  their \nstaff granted access  would  not  be permitted  to  remove, copy,  or  duplicate the  document.  Access  to  the \nPage  FISA  information  would  be  provided  only  to facilitate  Congress’  lawful  oversight of the \nGovernment’s  use of its  FISA  authority,  and  no  further  use  or disclosure  of the  Page  FISA  information  is \nrequested  or contemplated. \nCARED  FOR  DURIIC  RELEASE \n \nIV.  (U)  CONCLUSION \n(U)  Accordingly,  for the  reasons  more  particularly  described  above,  the  Government \nrequests  that  this  Court  issue  an  Order  setting additional  parameters  for the  use or  disclosure  of \nthe  limited  Page  FISA  information contained  in the  classified  appendix  to  the  Report  on  Matters \nRelated to  Intelligence Activities  and Investigations Arising out  of the  2016 Presidential \nCampaigns  to  select  members  of Congress.  A  proposed  Order  is  attached. \npated  @  Lh]23  Respectfully  submitted, \nMelissa  MacTough \nDeputy  Assistant  Attorney  General \nNational  Security Division \nU.S.  Department  of Justice \n \n\n############# Old Text on 20240903 ###############\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

In  the  Motion,  the  Government \nrequested  permission  to  share  with  certain  members  of Congress  the  Foreign  Intelligence \nSurveillance  Act  (FISA)  information  obtained  from  the  above-captioned  dockets  (“Page  FISA”) \ncontained  in the  Classified  Appendix  issued  by  Special  Counsel  John  H.  Durham.  On  June  9, \n2023,  this  Court  granted  the  Motion  and  permitted  specified  members  of Congress  and  staff to \n“access”  the  Page  FISA  information  in  the  Classified  Appendix  (“June  9,  2023  Order”).  The \nCourt  also  ordered  the  Government  to  provide  a  copy  of the  Motion  suitable  for public  release \nand  explain  why  any  redactions  are  necessary  by  June  30,  2023.  The  Government  submits  this \nletter to  provide  the  Court with  its  rationale  for the  limited  redactions  contained  in the  attached \nredacted  Motion  and  also  to  provide  an  update  regarding  the  process  the  Government  has \nimplemented  to  provide  Congress  with  access  to  the  Page  FISA  information. \nA.  (U)  REDACTIONS  MADE  TO  THE  MOTION \n(U)  The  Government  has  proposed  redacting part  of a  single  sentence  on  page  5  of the \nMotion.  Specifically,  the  Government  redacted  the  type  of collection  and  the  identification  of \nthe  communicants.  This  information has  not  been  declassified  and,  as  information  obtained \ndirectly  from  one  of the  Page  FISAs,  is  precluded  from  further  use  or  disclosure  by the  Court’s \nJune  25,  2020  Opinion  and  Order Regarding  Use  and  Disclosure  of Information  obtained  from \nthe  Page  FISAs  (“June  25,  2020  Order”).  In  the  June  25,  2020  Order,  the  Court  found  that  the \ncriminal  provisions  in  Sections  1809(a)(2)  and  1827(a)(2)  of FISA  applied  to  the  use  or \ndisclosure  of information  acquired  from  the  Page  FISA  dockets,  but  recognized  an  exception to \nthe  statute  for  actions  necessary to  mitigate  or  prevent the  very  harms  those  sections  are  designed \nto  address.  The  Court  then  authorized  the  use  or  disclosure  of Page  FISA  information  in  five \n   UNCLASSIFIED\nUNCLASSIFIED \nlimited  circumstances  described  by  the  Court.!  The  Government  does  not  believe  that  the  public \ndisclosure  of the  Page  FISA  information  removed  from  the  Motion  would  fall  within  any  of \nthose  five  circumstances. \nB.  (U)  ACCESS  PROVIDED  TO  CONGRESS \n(U)  In  the  Motion,  the  Government  requested  that  the  “Court  issue  an  Order  setting \nadditional  parameters  for  the  use  or  disclosure  of the  limited  Page  FISA  information  contained  in \nthe  classified  appendix”  and  proposed  an  order  for the  Court’s  consideration.  Motion  at  11.  The \nGovernment proposed  the  following  parameters:  (i)  the  unredacted  Classified  Appendix  would \nbe  kept  in  a U.S.  Government  Sensitive  Compartmented  Information  Facility  (SCIF),  (ii)  access \nto  the  document  would  be  given  within  that  SCIF,  and  (iii)  individuals  granted  access  would  be \nspecifically  precluded  from  removing,  copying  or  duplicating  the  Page  FISA  information.  The \nCourt’s  June  9,  2023  Order  did  not  impose  those  restrictions,  and  instead  permitted the \nGovernment to  “give  access  to  the  Page  FISA  information  in  the  Classified  Appendix”  to  the \nspecified  members  of Congress  and  staff.  June  9,  2023  Order  at  5  (permitting  sharing  with \nmembers  and  limited  staff on  the  United  States  House  Permanent  Select  Committee  on \nIntelligence  (HPSCI),  the  Senate  Select  Committee  on  Intelligence  (SSC),  the  United  States \nSenate  Committee  on  the  Judiciary  (SJC),  the  House  Judiciary  Committee  (HJC),  and  the \nmembers  identified  in  50  U.S.C.  §  3093(c)(2)  (the  Gang  of Eight)). \n(U)  The  Department  of Justice’s  Office  of Legislative  Affairs  (OLA),  which  has \nreviewed  and  confirmed  the  below  for  accuracy,  has  advised that  it  is  providing  access  to  the \nunredacted  Classified  Appendix  to  congressional  members  and  staff through  in  camera  review  of \nthe  document  in  a  House  or  Senate  SCIF.  OLA  further  advises  that they  have  reminded  those \nreviewing  the  unredacted  Classified  Appendix  of the  Court’s  Order in  this  matter.”  OLA  has \nalso  imposed the  following  terms  for  the  access  and  use  of the  unredacted  Classified  Appendix: \n1.

Page  (Page)  in  docket  numbers  2016-1182,  2017-0052,  2017-0375,  and \n2017-0679  (the  Page  FISAs)  as  comporting  with  Sections  1801(h)(1),  1809(a)(2),  1821(4)(A), \nand  1827(a)(2)  of FISA. \n(U)  Special  Counsel  John  H.  Durham  has  closed  his  investigation  into  potential  crimes \nrelating  to  intelligence  activities  and  investigations  arising  out  of the  2016 presidential \ncampaigns,  including  the  FBI’s  Crossfire  Hurricane  investigation,  and  has  prepared a  final  report \ntitled,  Report  on  Matters  Related to  Intelligence  Activities  and Investigations  Arising  out  of the \n2016  Presidential  Campaigns  (the  Report).  Although  the  Report  is  unclassified,  a  classified \nappendix  to  the  Report  includes  information  collected  pursuant  to  the  Page  FISAs  in  three \nparagraphs.  In  this  motion,  the  Government  proposes  parameters  for  the  use  and  disclosure  of \nClassified  by:  Assistant  Attorney  General  for National  Security \nDerived  From:  DOJ/NSI  SCG-1,  1.6;  FBI  NSICG  INV \nDeclassify  on:  20480607 \nREDACTED / CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE\nREDACTED  /  CLEARED  FOR  PUBLIC  RELEASE \nthe  classified  appendix  and  explains  why  such  limited  use  and  disclosure  of Page  FISA \ninformation  is  consistent  with  the  relevant  statutory  provisions.  See  50  U.S.C.  §§  1801(h)(1), \n1809(a)(2),  1821(4)(A),  and  1827(a)(2).  This  Court  previously  authorized  the  use  and  disclosure \nof Page  FISA  information  where  “necessary  to  remedy  or  deter  the  types  of harm  at  which  §§ \n1809  and  1827  are  addressed,”  Jn  Re  Carter  W.  Page,  docket  nos.  16-1182,  17-52,  17-375,  17- \n679,  dated  June  25,  2020  (J.  Boasberg)  (June  25,  2020  Order),  and  the  Government  requests  an \nOrder  authorizing  the  use  and  disclosure  of the  Page  FISA  information  in  the  classified  appendix \non  those  same  grounds. \n1.  (U)  BACKGROUND \n(U)  On  December  9,  2019,  the  DOJ  Office  of the  Inspector  General  (OIG)  released  a \nreport  titled,  Review  of Four  FISA  Applications  and  Other  Aspects  of the  FBI's  Crossfire \nHurricane  Investigation  (the  OIG  Report),  which  detailed  material  omissions  and  misstatements \nwith  respect  to  the  Page  FISAs.'  As  set  forth  therein,  DOJ  assessed  that  at  least  as  of the  time  of \nthe  third  and  fourth  applications  targeting  Page  in  docket  numbers  17-375  and  17-679,  if not \nearlier,  there  was  insufficient  predication  to  establish  probable  cause  to  believe  that  Page  was \nacting  as  an  agent  of a  foreign  power.  On  January  7,  2020,  the  Court  ordered  the  Government  to \nprovide  information  regarding  the  handling  and  disposition of  information  acquired  pursuant  to \nthe  Page  FISAs,  and  an  explanation  as  to  why  the  retention  of such  information,  and  any \ncontemplated  use  or disclosure  of it,  comports  with  Sections  1801(h)(1),  1809(a)(2),  1821(4)(A), \n'(U)  See  also  letters  submitted  by  the Government  pursuant  to  Rule  13(a)  of the Court’s  Rules of \nProcedure  dated  July  12,  2018,  October 25,  2019,  November 27,  2019  and  December  9,  2019. \n2 \nEDACTED / CLEARED  FOR PUBLIC RELEASE\nREDACTED  / CLEARED  FOR PUBLIC  RELEASE \nand  1827(a)(2)  of FISA.2  The  Government  filed an  initial  Response  on  February  5,  2020 \n(February  5  Response),  and  three  Supplemental  Responses  on  February  28  (February  28 \nResponse),  April  17,  2020  (April  17  Response),  and  October  21,  2020  (October  21  Response). \n(U)  On  June  25,  2020,  the  Court  issued  an  Opinion  and  Order  Regarding the  Use  and \nDisclosure of Information  obtained  or derived  om  the  Page  FISAs,  which  found  that  the \ncriminal  provisions  in  Sections  1809(a)(2)  and  1827(a)(2)  applied  to  the use  or  disclosure  of \ninformation  acquired  from  the  above  dockets.2  Beginning  with  a previously  recognized \nexception  to  Sections  1809(a)(2)  and  1827(a)(2)  for  actions  necessary  to  mitigate  or  prevent  the \nvery  harms  those  sections  are  designed  to  address,  the  Court  set  parameters  for  the  use  or \ndisclosure  of Page  FISA  information  in  five  limited  circumstances  described  by  the  Government \nand  analyzed  by  the  Court.’  Of particular  relevance  here,  the  fifth  circumstance  authorized  the \n2  (U)  It  is  a  criminal  offense  to  “intentionally”  engage  in “electronic  surveillance  under color  of law \nexcept as  authorized  by”  statute,  or disclose “information  obtained  under color of law by electronic \nsurveillance,  knowing  or having reason  to know that the  information  was  obtained through  electronic \nsurveillance”  that  had  not  been  properly  authorized.  §  1809(a).  It  is  similarly  an  offense  to  intentionally \nconduct  a  physical  search  under color of law  within the  United  States to  obtain  foreign  intelligence \ninformation “except as  authorized  by  statute,” or to  intentionally  disclose  or use  information  obtained  by \nsuch  a  search  “knowing  or having reason  to  know that the  information was  obtained through  physical \nsearch  not authorized  by  statute  [...].”  §  1827(a). \n3(U)  The  Office of the  Director of National  Intelligence,  in  consultation  with  DOJ  and  the  FBI, \npublically  released  a  declassified  and  redacted  version  of the Court’s  Opinion  on  September  |  1,  2020. \nThe  publically  released  Opinion  can  be  found  at \nhttps://www. intelligence. gov/assets/documents/702%20Documents/declassified/June_2020_F ISC_Opinio \nn.pdf \n4(U)  More specifically,  following  its  analysis of applicable  FBI  minimization  procedures  as  required  by \nFISA  (Sections  1801(h)(1)  and  1821(a)(2)),  as  well  as  Sections  1809(a)(2)  and  1827(a)(2)  and  certain \nlimited  exceptions  to  those  criminal  provisions  of the Act,  the  Court  set parameters  for the  use  or \ndisclosure  of Page  FISA  information  in the  following  five  circumstances:  (1)  certain  identified  ongoing \nthird-party  litigation  pursuant  to  the  Freedom of Information  Act  (FOIA);  (2)  ongoing  and \nanticipated  FOIA  and  civil  litigation  with  Page;  (3)  FBI  review of the  conduct  of its  personnel \ninvolved  in  the  Page  investigation;  (4)  DOJ  OIG  monitoring of the  implementation  of one of  the \n3 \nREDACTED  /  CLEARED  FOR  PUBLIC  RELEASE\nREDACTED  / CLEARED  FOR PUBLIC RELEASE \nuse  or  disclosure  of Page  FISA  information  “as  necessary  to  investigate  or  prosecute  potential \ncrimes  relating  to  the  conduct  of the  Page  or  Crossfire  Hurricane  investigations,”  and  noted  that \nthis  paragraph  applied  to,  but  was  not  limited  to,  “the  review  being  lead  by  United  States \nAttorney  Durham.”  /d.  at  21.  The  Court  also  required  that  the  Government  file  a  written  report \non  the  retention,  use,  or  disclosure  of Page  FISA  information  every  six  months  (the  Semi-Annual \nReports).  Id. \n(U)  In  the  January  27,  2023  Semi-Annual  Report,  the  Government  advised  that  Special \nCounsel  Durham  was  concluding  his  investigation  and  would  likely  be  sharing  Page  FISA \ninformation  with  Government  agencies  for  the  purposes  of vetting  a  draft  memorandum,  but  that \nthe  Government  would  inform  the  Court  if the  final  memorandum  included  Page  FISA \ninformation  before  it  was  made  public.  Special  Counsel  Durham  has  produced  an  unclassified \nreport  and  a classified  appendix  to  the  report,  and  limited  Page  FISA  information  is  included  in \nthe  classified  appendix.  In  particular,  limited  Page  FISA  information  is  described  in  sections  of \nthe  classified  appendix  addressing  how  the  FBI  assessed,  explained,  or  excluded  potentially \nrelevant  information  from  the  Page  FISA  applications.  The  unclassified  report  and  classified \nappendix  have  been  provided  by  Special  Counsel  Durham  to  the  Attorney  General  and  Office  of \nthe  Deputy  Attorney  General.  The  unclassified  report  was  publicly  released  on  May  15,  2023. \n(eae  ee  On  page  25  of the  Classified  Appendix,  one  paragraph  refers  toa \ncommunication  involving  Page  made  in  2016.  That  communication  was  publicly  discussed  in \npart during  Page’s  testimony  before  the  United  States  House  Permanent  Select  Committee  on \nrecommendations  (Recommendation  9)  stemming  from  the  OIG  Report;  and  (5)  the  investigation \nand  prosecution  of Government  personnel  relating  to  the  Crossfire  Hurricane  investigations.  Jd.  at \n20-21. \n4 \nREDACTED / CLEARED FOR PUBLIC  RELEASE\nREDACTED  / CLEARED  FOR PUBLIC  RELEASE \nIntelligence  (HPSCI)  on November 2017,  and  is  quoted  in  the  publicly  available  United  States \nSenate  Select  Committee  on  Intelligence’s  (SSCI)  Report  on  Russian Active  Measures \nCampaigns  and Interference  in  the  2016  U.S.  Election,  vol.  5,  at  549  (SSCl  Report).  The \nClassified  Appendix  refers  to  FBI  assessments  discussed  in  the  first  Page  renewal  application \nbased  on  this  communication  and  also  discusses  information  the  communication did  not  contain. \nThe  other  paragraphs  that  refer  to  Page  FISA  information  are  on  pages  28-29  of the  Classified \niI.  (U)  PROPOSED  PARAMETERS  FOR  USE  OR  DISCLOSURE  OF  THE \nLIMITED  PAGE  FISA  INFORMATION  IN  THE  CLASSIFIED  APPENDIX \n(U)  While  the  Report  has  been  publicly  released,  the  unredacted  version  of the  classified \nappendix  will  only  be  disclosed  within  the  executive  branch  to  the  Office  of the  Attorney \nGeneral  (OAG)  and  the  Office  of the  Deputy  Attorney  General  (ODAG),  which  have supervisory \nauthority  over  the  investigation  led  by  Special  Counsel  Durham;  the  Office  of the  Director  and \nDeputy  Director  of the  FBI,  who  have  a  need  to  understand  the  decisions  made  by  Special \nCounsel  Durham  in  his  report,  and  the  implications  to  the  FBI  of those  decisions,  including  if \nthey  are  relevant as  part  of any  potential  disciplinary  review;  and  senior  officials  in  the \nDepartment’s  Office  of the  Inspector  General  (OIG),  who  have  oversight  responsibilities  for  the \nDepartment,  including  the  authority  to  initiate  criminal  investigations  based  on allegations  of \nwrongdoing.° \n(U)  Additionally,  the  Government  proposes  keeping  copies  of the  unredacted  classified \nappendix  stored  in  a  U.S.  Government  Sensitive  Compartmented  Information  Facility  (SCIF)  so \n5  (U)  In  addition,  limited  personnel  within  DOJ’s National  Security  Division  (NSD)  were  provided  a \nfinal  draft  copy of the classified  appendix  in  order to  prepare  this  motion. \n5 \nREDACTED  /  CLEARED  FOR  PUBLIC  RELEASE\nREDACTED  / CLEARED  FOR PUBLIC  RELEASE \nthat  the  Page  FISA  information  can  be  shared  with  select  members  of Congress  with  oversight \nresponsibility  for  FISA.  In  particular,  the  Government  recommends  that  members  and  limited \nstaff of HPSCI,  SSCI,  the  United  States  Senate  Committee  on  the  Judiciary  (SJC),  the  House \nJudiciary  Committee,  and  the  Gang  of Eight®  be  given  restricted  access  to  the  unredacted \nClassified  Appendix.  To  ensure  that  the  document  is  not  further  used  or  disclosed  while  retained \nin  the  U.S.  Government  SCIE,  it  will  be  kept  secure  with  access  only  to  those  individuals  needed \nto  facilitate  the  review  described  above.  Additionally,  the  above  individuals  will  be  able  to  view, \nbut  not  remove,  copy,  or duplicate  the  document. \nII.  (U)  THE  PROPOSED  LIMITED  USE  AND  DISCLOSURE  OF  PAGE  FISA \nMATERIAL  IS  CONSISTENT  WITH  SECTIONS  1801(h)(1),  1809(a)(2), \n1821(4)(A),  AND  1827(a)(2)  OF  FISA \n(U)  In  its  June  25,  2020  Order,  the  Court  considered  the  permissibility  of the \nGovernment’s  ongoing  retention,  use  and  disclosure  of the  Page  FISA  information  in  the  five \nlimited  circumstances  described  above.  Regarding  retention,  the  Court  noted  that  neither \nSections  1802(h)(1)  and  1821(4)(A),  nor  the  FBI’s  underlying  minimization  procedures, \nexplicitly  required  destruction.  Nonetheless,  the  Court  noted  that  it  has  previously  ordered  the \ndestruction  of information  obtained  through  unauthorized  electronic  surveillance and/or  physical \nsearch  absent  some  permissible  form  of use  or disclosure.  June  25,  2020  Order  at  7.  The  Court \nultimately  concluded  that  ‘some  permissible  forms  of use  and  disclosure  of Page  FISA \ninformation”  were  reasonably  anticipated  and,  accordingly,  did  not  order  the  destruction  of the \n6  (U)  Pursuant  to  50  U.S.C.  §  3093(c)(2),  under “extraordinary  circumstances” the  President  is  entitled  to \nlimit  access  to  certain  intelligence  information  to  eight  members  of Congress:  the  leaders  of each of the \ntwo  parties  from  both  the House  of Representatives  and  the  Senate  as  well  as  the  chair  and  ranking \nminority  members  of HPSCI  and  SSCI. \n6 \nREDACTED / CLEARED  FOR PUBLIC  RELEASE\nREDACTED  /  CLEARED  FOR  PUBLI \nPage  FISA  information.  /d.  The  Government  submits  that the  limited  sharing  described  supra \nalso  constitutes  permissible  forms  of use  and  disclosure  of Page  FISA  information. \n(U)  First,  the  disclosure  of the  unredacted  classified  appendix  to  OAG,  ODAG,  the \nOffice  of the  Director  and  Deputy  Director  of the  FBI,  and  OIG  logically  falls  within  the  fifth \ncategory  set  forth  in  the  June  25,  2020  Order.  There,  the  Court  set parameters  for  the  use  or \ndisclosure  of Page  FISA  information  “as  necessary  to  investigate  or  prosecute  potential  crimes \nrelating  to  the  conduct of the  Page  or  Crossfire  Hurricane  investigations...”  Id.  at  21.  The  Court \nnoted  that,  “[tJhis  paragraph  applies,  but  is  not  limited  to,  use  by,  and  disclosure  by  or to, \npersonnel  engaged  in  the  review  being  lead  [sic]  by  United  States  Attomey  Durham.”  Jd.  An \nend  of investigation  report  is  an  integral  part  of an  investigation,  as  it  explains  the  investigative \nfindings  and  prosecutorial  decisions  of the  investigative  team.  Special  Counsel  Durham  has \nadvised  that  the  Page  FISA  information  included  in  the  classified  appendix  is  necessary  to \nunderstand  his  findings  and  decisions.  Because  OAG  and  ODAG  have  supervisory  authority \nover  the  investigation,  the  FBI  Office  of the  Director  and  Deputy  Director  need  to  understand  the \nimplications  of Special  Counsel  Durham’s  decisions,  including  if relevant  to potential \ndisciplinary  reviews,  and  the  OIG  has  oversight  authority  over  the  Department,’  disclosure  of \n7(U)  The  Government assesses  that the  disclosure  of the  limited  Page FISA  information  in the  Classified \nAppendix to the  OIG  is  consistent  with  both  categories 4  and  5  of the Court’s June  25,  2020  Order.  June \n25,  2020  Order at  20-21.  For  example,  category  $  applies to disclosures  necessary to  investigate  or \nprosecute  potential  crimes relating to  the conduct of the  Page  or Crossfire  Hurricane  investigations.  Jd.  at \n21.  Some  of the  sub-parts of recommendations  from  the  O1G’s  investigation  and  report  remain  open.  In \naddition,  category  4  of the June  25,  2020  Order permits  use  or disclosure  as  necessary  to  assess  the \nimplementation  of Recommendation  9  of the  OIG  report.  /d.at  20.  Recommendation  9  stated  that the \n\"FBI  should  review the  performance of all  employees  who  had  responsibility  for the  preparation,  Woods \nreview,  or approval  of the  FISA  applications  [for  Page],  as  well  as  the  managers,  supervisors,  and  senior \nofficials  in  the  chain  of command of the  Carter  Page  investigation.”  Jd.  The  limited  Page  FISA \ninformation  described  in  sections  of the  Classified  Appendix  appears  to have  been  included  for the \n7 \nREDACTED  /  CLEARED  FOR  PUBLIC  RELEASE\n  \nPage  FISA  information  to  certain  individuals  in  these  components  comports  with  the  parameters \nset  forth  in  the  June  25,  2020  Order. \n(U)  Second,  although  not  expressly  authorized by  the  June  25,  2020  Order,  the \nGovernment  believes  that  sharing  the  unredacted  classified  appendix  with  the  members  of \nCongress  who  have  oversight  responsibility  for  FISA,  the  FBI,  and  the  Department  of Justice \n(DOJ)  is  consistent  with  the  FISA  statute.  The  Government  recognizes  that  it  is  “not  free  to \ndepart  from  the  plain  meaning  of  §§  1809(a)(2)  and  1827(a)(2)  simply  to  facilitate  actions  thought \nto  be  reasonable,  or  even  laudable”  and  that  the  Court  has  limited  use  or  disclosure  of Page  FISA \ninformation “only  where  it  has  been  or  can  be  demonstrated  to  be  necessary  to  remedy  or  deter \nthe  types  of harm  at  which  §§  1809  and  1827  are  addressed.”  Jd.  at  20.  However,  the \nGovernment  has  previously  notified  the  Court  of the  disclosure  of Page  FISA  material  to \nCongress  under  the  exception  articulated  in  the  June  25,  2020  Order.  As  reported  in  the  October \n21  Response,  the  Government  explained  that  the  FBI  was  sharing  Page  FISA  information  with \nSJC,  which  was  investigating  the  conduct  of Government  personnel  involved  in  the  Crossfire \nHurricane  investigation.  In  particular,  the  Government  noted  that  SJC’s  Chief Investigative \nCounsel  had  been  provided  a  document  that  contained  Page  FISA  information,  and  that  the  FBI \nanticipated  that  witnesses  called  before  SJC  would  be  required  to  orally  disclose  Page  FISA \ninformation  in  response  to  questions  posed  by  the  committee.  As  explained  in  the  October  21 \npurpose  of addressing how  the  FBI  assessed,  explained,  or excluded  potentially  relevant  information  from \nthe  Page  FISA  applications.  To  the  extent  this  represents  new  information  to  the OIG  regarding how the \nFBI  personnel  assessed,  explained,  or  excluded  potentially  relevant information  from the  Page  FISA \napplications,  it  touches  on  the  performance  of FBI  personne!  who  prepared  the  applications,  which would \nbe  relevant to  recommendation  9  of the  OJG  report. \n8 \nREDACTED /  CLEARED  FOR PUBLIC  RELEASE\n  \n  2   PUDLIC  RELEASE \nResponse,  such  disclosures  to  SJC  were  consistent  with  the  parameters  for  the  use  or disclosure \nof Page  FISA  information  set  forth  in  the  June  25,  2020  Order. \n(U)  While  there  are  not any  active  investigations  by  Congress  into  Crossfire Hurricane, \nCongress  performs  ongoing  oversight  of the  FBI,  DOJ,  and  the  Government’s  use  of its  FISA \nauthority.  See  50  U.S.C.  §  1871.  To  the  extent  that  the  classified  appendix  provides additional \ndetails  about  how  the  Government  has  exercised  its  authority under the  FISA  statute,  that \ninformation  is  clearly  vital  to  the  Congressional  oversight  function.  Indeed,  the  understanding  of \nprecisely  what  went  wrong  during  Crossfire  Hurricane  will  inform  how  Congress  proceeds  in \nattempting to  prevent  future unauthorized  collections  and  violations  of §§  1809  and  1827.8 \nMoreover,  even  if the  oversight  committees  do  not  reopen  their  prior  investigations  into \nCrossfire  Hurricane  based  on  information  contained  in  the  classified  appendix,  future  hearings \nrelated  to  FISA  may  involve  discussion  of the  Crossfire  Hurricane  investigation  and  the  issues \nwith  the  Page  FISA  applications.?  Accordingly,  it  is  incumbent  upon  the  Government  to  provide \n8  (U)  If the Government does  not proactively  provide  access to  the classified  appendix  to  facilitate  this \noversight  responsibility,  it  is  likely  that  Congress  will  attempt to  compel  production  of the classified \nappendix through  other  means.  On  May  16, 2023,  the Attomey General  received a letter  from  HPSC] \nrequesting  the  transmittal  of the  classified  appendix,  noting that  pursuant  to  “House  Rule  X, the \nCommittee  has jurisdiction  over all  intelligence  and  intelligence-related  activities  of the  departments  and \nagencies of the  U.S.  government”  and  advising  that  if the classified  appendix  is  not  produced  in  an \n“expeditious  and  satisfactory  manner,  you  should  expect the  Committee  to use  its  additional tools and \nauthorities to  satisfy  our  legislative  and  oversight  requirements.”  See  Letter to  the Attorney General from \nHPSCI Chairman  Michael R.  Turner  and Ranking  Member James A.  Himes. \n°(U)  For  example,  in  the April  27,  2023  Hearing,  “Fixing  FISA:  How  a  law  designed  to  Protect \nAmericans  Has  Been  Weaponized  Against Them” held  by  the  United  States  House J udiciary \nSubcommittee on  Crime  and  Federal  Government  Surveillance,  the  opening  statement  by  Chairman  Andy \nBiggs  categorized  Crossfire  Hurricane  as a  “pretext  to  illegally  spy  on Trump campaign  associates” \nduring the  2016  campaign,  as  recorded  in  a  video  available  at  https://judiciary.house.gov/committee- \nactivity/hearings/fixing-fisa-how-law-designed-protect-americans-has-been-weaponized. \n9 \nRPEENDAA CTED / CALL EAREEADR EN FOEO D  PIRI LIItC  PEI REELEAASE \na  fulsome and  accurate  record  of its  investigations  into  the  conduct  of Government personnel. \nCongressional  committees  with  direct  FISA  oversight  authority  need  access  to  the  Government’s \ninvestigations  of Crossfire  Hurricane  so  they  can  make  informed  decisions  on  whether  additional \nreforms  or  remedial  measures are  needed.  The  Government  believes  that  the  limited'°  sharing  of \nthe  Page  FISA  information  in  the  classified  appendix,  some  of which  was  already  referred  to  in \nthe  public  version  of the  SSCI  Report,  to  select  members  of Congress  and  their  staff will \nultimately  help  prevent  the  types  of harms  at  which  Sections  1809  and  1827  are  addressed,  and \ntherefore  meets  the  implicit  exception  to  those  statutes  recognized  by  this  Court. \n10  (U)  As  described supra, the  parameters  for disclosure of  the  Page  FISA  information  recommended  by \nthe  Government  were  designed  to  prevent any  further disclosure  of the material.  The classified  appendix \nwould  be  retained  in  restricted  access  in  a  U.S.  Government  SCIF,  and  members  of Congress and  their \nstaff granted access  would  not  be permitted  to  remove, copy,  or  duplicate the  document.  Access  to  the \nPage  FISA  information  would  be  provided  only  to facilitate  Congress’  lawful  oversight of the \nGovernment’s  use of its  FISA  authority,  and  no  further  use  or disclosure  of the  Page  FISA  information  is \nrequested  or contemplated. \nCARED  FOR  DURIIC  RELEASE \n \nIV.  (U)  CONCLUSION \n(U)  Accordingly,  for the  reasons  more  particularly  described  above,  the  Government \nrequests  that  this  Court  issue  an  Order  setting additional  parameters  for the  use or  disclosure  of \nthe  limited  Page  FISA  information contained  in the  classified  appendix  to  the  Report  on  Matters \nRelated to  Intelligence Activities  and Investigations Arising out  of the  2016 Presidential \nCampaigns  to  select  members  of Congress.  A  proposed  Order  is  attached. \npated  @  Lh]23  Respectfully  submitted, \nMelissa  MacTough \nDeputy  Assistant  Attorney  General \nNational  Security Division \nU.S.  Department  of Justice \n \n\n############# Old Text on 20240903 ###############\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

PAGE,  Docket Numbers: \nAU.S. PERSON  16-1182,  17-52,  17-375,  17-679 \n  \n  \nORDER RESPECTING  THE LIMITED DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION \nIN THE  CLASSIFIED APPENDIX TO THE REPORT ON MATTERS \nRELATED TO  INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES AND INVESTIGATIONS \nARISING OUT OF THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS \nThis matter is before the Court on the Government’s Motion to Permit the Disclosure of \nInformation Contained in the Classified Appendix to the Report on Matters Related to \nIntelligence Activities and Investigations Arising out of the 2016  Presidential  Campaigns,  filed \nin the above-captioned dockets on June 7, 2023  (“Motion”).  The Court is granting the Motion as \nstated herein. \nOn June 25, 2020,  the Court  issued an Opinion and Order Regarding Use and Disclosure \nof Information entered in the above-captioned four dockets (“June 25, 2020 Order”), which \nexplained why the results of electronic surveillance and physical search conducted under color of \norders issued in those dockets’  were subject to the prohibitions against use  or disclosure of the \nresults of unauthorized surveillance and search set forth in 50  U.S.C.  §§  1809(a)(2) and \n1827(a)(2).  It is a criminal  offense to “intentionally .  .  .  (1) engage[ }  in electronic surveillance \n * Information acqui red under color of the above-captioned dockets, in both minimized and un-minimized (ie, raw) \nform, is referred to as “Page FISA information.” \n1 \nUNCLASSIFIED\nUNCLASSIFIED \nunder color of law except as authorized by”  identified statutory provisions, or “(2) disclose[ ]  or \nuse[ ]  information obtained under color of law by electronic  surveillance, knowing or having \nreason to know that the information was obtained through  electronic surveillance not authorized” \nby FISA or another “express statutory  authorization.”  50 U.S.C.  §  1809(a).  It is similarly an \noffense to  intentionally conduct a physical search under color of law within the United  States to \nobtain foreign intelligence  information,  “except as  authorized by statute,” or intentionally \ndisclose or use  information obtained by such a search, “knowing or having reason to know that \nthe information was obtained through physical search not authorized by statute,  for the purpose \nof obtaining intelligence information.”  50 U.S.C.  §  1827(a).  The applications  in the above- \ncaptioned dockets  involved “material errors and omissions” pertinent “to whether there was \nprobable cause to believe that Page was an agent of a foreign power.”  June 25,  2020  Order at  1. \nAs a  result of those deficiencies,  the government admitted that “at least the third and fourth Page \nFISA applications  lacked  adequate factual  support” and that “the restrictions on use or disclosure \nin Sections  1809 and  1827 apply at least to  information acquired under color of the third and \nfourth dockets,  ...”  Jd.  at 4 (internal quotation marks  omitted).  Because “the government \ndeclined  to argue .  .  .  that those provisions do not apply (or apply differently) to  information \nobtained under the  first two  dockets,” the Court proceeded from the premise that Sections \n1809(a)(2) and  1827(a)(2)  apply to  information acquired under color of all  four dockets.  Jd. \nThe June 25, 2020 Order also recognized an exception to those prohibitions where use or \ndisclosure of particular information “has been or can be demonstrated to be necessary to remedy \nor deter the types of harm at which §§  1809 and  1827 are addressed,” such as when use or \ndisclosure is “necessary to avoid similar instances of over-collection  .  .  .  or to remedy a prior \nUNCLASSIFIED\nUNCLASSIFIED \nover-collection.”  Jd.  at 4, 20 (internal quotation marks omitted and alteration in original). \nFurthermore,  “Sections  1809 and  1827 would be self-defeating if they were interpreted to \nprohibit use or disclosure of [information from unauthorized electronic surveillance or physical \nsearch],  even when necessary to  investigate and prosecute the very  crimes they define.”  Jd.  at \n19,  Pursuant to that exception, the Court permitted use or disclosure of Page FISA information \nin certain specified contexts,  including “insofar as necessary to effective performance or \ndisciplinary reviews of government personnel” and “insofar as necessary to  investigate or \nprosecute potential  crimes relating to the conduct of the Page or Crossfire Hurricane \ninvestigations.”  Jd,  at 20-21.  The  latter context, the Court explained,  was  applicable (but not \nlimited to) “use by,  and disclosure by or to, personnel  engaged in the review” of such \ninvestigations then being  led by John H.  Durham.  /d.  at  17, 21. \nThe completion of Mr.  Durham’s work as  Special Counsel  has given rise to the \ngovernment’s current request to disclose a limited amount of Page FISA information under \ncircumstances not  contemplated  by the June 25, 2020  Order.  Special  Counsel Durham has \nprepared a  final report titled Report on Matters Related to Intelligence Activities and \nInvestigations Arising out of the 2016 Presidential Campaigns (“Report”).  Motion at  1.  The \nReport is unclassified and has been released to the public; however, there  is  a Classified \nAppendix to the Report, which contains  a limited amount of Page FISA information.  Jd.  at  1, 4. \nThat information “is described  in sections of the classified appendix addressing how the FBI \nassessed, explained,  or excluded potentially relevant information from the Page  FISA \napplications.”  Id. at 4. \nUNCLASSIFIED\nUNCLASSIFIED \nThrough the underlying Motion,  the Government seeks to  share the Classified Appendix \nwith select Members of Congress and limited staff “who have oversight responsibility for FISA, \nthe FBI, and the Department of Justice.”  Jd.  at 8.  Towards that end, the  Government proposes to \ndistribute the Classified Appendix,  including its Page FISA  information, to Members and  limited \nstaff of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the U.S.  Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence, the House Judiciary Committee, the U.S.  Senate  Committee on the \nJudiciary, and to the Members of Congress  identified in  50 U.S.C.  §  3093(c)(2).  Jd.  at 6.  In the \nGovernment’s view,  disclosure of the Page  FISA information contained in the Classified \nAppendix may provide details about how the Government has exercised FISA authorities, and as \na result, may “inform how Congress proceeds in attempting to prevent future unauthorized \ncollections and violations of §§  1809 and  1827.”  Jd. at 9.  “Accordingly, it is incumbent upon \nthe Government to provide a fulsome and accurate record of its investigations into the conduct of \nGovernment personnel  [involved  in the Page or Crossfire Hurricane investigation].”  Jd.  at 9-10. \nThe Court’s previously recognized exception to the prohibitions found in 50 U.S.C.  §§ \n1809(a)(2) and  1827(a)(2), when necessary to remedy or deter the types of harm at which those \nsections are addressed, is very limited.  “Neither the government nor the Court is free to depart \nfrom the plain meaning of §§  1809(a)(2)  and  1827(a)(2)  simply to  facilitate actions thought to be \nreasonable, or even  laudable.”  June 25, 2020 Order at 20.  Here, the disclosure of the Report’s \nClassified Appendix,  including its  Page FISA information, to  certain Congressional personnel \nengaged  in ongoing oversight of the Government’s exercise of FISA authorities will provide the \ncomplete published results of Special Counsel Durham’s investigation,  including with respect to \nthe FBI’s FISA activities regarding Page.  As such, the Court views disclosure in this narrow \n4 \nUNCLASSIFIED\nUNCLASSIFIED \ncontext as aligning with the purposes for use or disclosure of Page FISA information set out in \nthe June 25, 2020 Order.  See Order Regarding Further Disclosures of Information, Nos.  16- \n1182,  17-52,  17-375,  17-679,  at 2  (ISA Ct. Nov.  23, 2020) (citing the June 25, 2020  Order and \nfinding “disclosure of Page FISA information to the  Senate Committee on the Judiciary,  under \nthe circumstances described by the government, to be consistent with the parameters for \ndisclosure previously established  by the Court”). \nThe government has marked one paragraph of the Motion as classified at the Secret level. \nThe rest of the Motion is marked as Unclassified.  This Order is marked in the same manner \nbecause  it contains  information only from the Unclassified paragraphs of the Motion. \nAccordingly,  IT IS  HEREBY ORDERED THAT the Motion  is GRANTED as  follows: \nNotwithstanding the June 25, 2020 Order, the government may give access to the Page  FISA \ninformation in the Classified Appendix to members and  limited staff of the House Permanent \nSelect Committee on Intelligence, the U.S.  Senate  Select Committee on Intelligence,  the U.S. \nSenate Committee on the Judiciary,  and the House Judiciary Committee, and to the members of \nCongress identified in 50 U.S.C.  §  3093(c)(2), and \nIT IS  FURTHER ORDERED THAT,  in all other respects,  the June 25, 2020  Order \nremains in effect, including (i) the six-month reporting requirement on the retention, use, or \ndisclosure of any Page FISA information and (ii) the prohibition on further use or disclosure of \nsuch information (except as permitted by this Order or the June 25,  2020 Order),  and \nIT IS  FURTHER ORDERED THAT, by June 30,  2023,  the government shall submit to \nthe Court a copy of the  Motion that is suitable for public release,  including any  redactions the \n3 \nUNCLASSIFIED\nUNCLASSIFIED \ngovernment believes are necessary.

      "text": "U.S. Department of Justice \nNational Security Division \nWashington, D.C.  20530 \nAugust 28, 2020 \nThe Honorable James E. Boasberg \nUnited States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \n333 Constitution Avenue, N.W. \nWashington, D.C.  20001 \nRe:  In Re Accuracy Concerns Regarding FBI Matters Submitted to the FISC, \nDocket No. Misc. 19-02 \nDear Judge Boasberg: \nThe Government respectfully submits this update as required by the Corrected Opinion \nand Order of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (the Court) entered on March 5, 2020 \n(March 5, 2020 Order), as modified by the Court's Order of June 23, 2020, which granted the \nGovernment's motion to modify the reporting period.  Specifically, the Government herein \nprovides the Court with updates regarding technological improvements the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation (FBI) is undertaking to aid in consistency and accountability within the FISA \napplication process. \nBy way of background, the March 5, 2020 Order directed the Government to provide by \nMarch 27, 2020, \"a description of any planned or implemented technological improvements to \nthe process of preparing FISA applications or verifying the information contained in FISA \napplications and updates every thirty days thereafter until they have been fully implemented.\" \nMarch 5, 2020 Order at 17.  Following the Court's grant of a one-week extension, the \nGovernment filed a response to the March 5, 2020 Order on April 3, 2020.1  The Government \nsubsequently provided the Court with updates regarding technological improvements to the \nprocess of preparing, or verifying the information contained in, FISA applications on April 30, \n2020,2 and again on May 29, 2020.3  On June 4, 2020, the Government submitted a Motion to \nModify Reporting Period requesting that subsequent updates be provided to the Court every \nninety days rather than every thirty days.  On June 23, 2020, the Court issued an Order granting \nthe requested modification. \nThe Government hereby provides the third update regarding these technological \nimprovements.  As explained previously, the FBI currently manages its FISA-related workflow \n1 Response to the Court's Corrected Opinion and Order Dated March 5, 2020 and Update to the Government's \nJanuary l 0, 2020 Response, at 19-20. \n2 Supplemental Response to the Court's Order Dated December 17, 2019; the Court's Scheduling Order Dated \nJanuary 17, 2020; and the Court's Corrected Opinion and Order Dated March 5, 2020, Attachment A at I 0-12. \n3 Letter from Kevin O'Connor, Chief, Oversight Section to the Honorable James E. Boasberg (May 29, 2020). \n\nprocesses in a platform called the FISA Management System (FISAMS), but is transitioning to a \nsystem colloquially known as \"the Bridge.\"  The Bridge is designed to increase collaboration \nwithin FBI, as well as between FBI and OI, though it is not expected to replace FISAMS until at \nleast the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. \nSeveral design features of the Bridge also are expected to enhance accuracy in the FISA \nprocess.  As discussed in the April 30 Response, this includes, for example, creating a technical \ninterface between the Bridge and the FBI's case management system, known as Sentinel.  As set \nforth in the May 29 Letter, this interface will afford Bridge users the ability to ensure a high level \nof data integrity, by automatically cross-referencing data input in the Bridge with existing case \ndata in Sentinel.  The interface between the Bridge and Sentinel also will provide users the \nability to serialize to Sentinel documents created in, or required for, the Bridge, including \ndocuments necessary for the creation of an accuracy sub-file. \nThe FBI's efforts to develop and implement the Bridge are continuous and ongoing.  In \nthe last update, provided in the May 29 Letter, the FBI reported that the Bridge team had \nreceived authorization from the Sentinel team to build and integrate technical interfaces with \nSentinel, so as to allow for the exchange and validation of data between the two systems. \nHaving secured that authorization, during this reporting period the Bridge team completed \nintegration of a case validation feature, which will facilitate automated validation of the accuracy \nof certain information input into the Bridge, by comparing it against information contained in a \nrelated Sentinel case file.  The Bridge team also completed digitization of the FBI's electronic \nsurveillance and physical search FISA Request Form and developed within the Bridge the user \ninterface for the digitized version of the form.  As a result of the team's development work, the \nBridge also now includes a feature that will permit automated serialization of an approved FISA \nRequest Form into the appropriate Sentinel case file.  In addition, the Bridge team completed \ndevelopment of a feature that will allow users to upload into the Bridge documents related to the \nFBI's Confidential Human Source Checklist, as well as to associate those documents with a \nspecified FISA Request Form.  The FBI believes that automating these processes and ensuring \nthat relevant documents are routinely serialized and/or easily uploaded into FBI systems will \nimprove the FISA process by reducing inadvertent errors; providing ready access to documents \nfor review and analysis; and promoting collaboration between all parties involved in the FISA \nprocess. \nThe FBI also is working on technological improvements related to its accuracy \nprocedures, also known as the Woods Procedures, which will ultimately be integrated into the \nBridge.  These efforts are designed to use Sentinel to automate certain processes FBI personnel \nuse to create accuracy sub-files and ensure the contents thereof are available in a manner that is \nconsistent with the FBI's standard minimization procedures.  In essence, the project will enable \nan employee to package and export serialized documents comprising an accuracy sub-file to \nother FBI personnel involved in a FISA application.  The FBI believes this will enhance the \naccuracy and completeness of FISA applications by, for example, making documents readily \navailable to those FBI personnel working on applications and/or attesting to their accuracy. \nUntil this capability is integrated into the Bridge, the FBI is working to integrate this feature into \nSentinel, by adapting a pre-existing tool designed to export documents for discovery purposes. \n2 \n\nThis letter constitutes the Government's third update in the above-captioned docket \nregarding planned or implemented technological improvements.  The FBI has reviewed this \nresponse and confirmed its accuracy. \nRespectfully submitted, \nm O'Connor \nhief, Oversight Section \nOffice of Intelligence, \nNational Security Division \nU.S. Department of Justice \n3 ",

      "text": "UNITED STATES \nWASHINGTON, D.C. \nDocket Numbers:  16-1182, 17-\nIN RE CARTER W. PAGE, A U.S. PERSON \n0052, 17-0375, &  17-0679 \nNOTICE OF POTENTIAL USE OR DISCLOSURE OF FISA INFORMATION \nSUBJECT TO THE COURT'S ORDER DATED JUNE 25,2020 \nThe United States of America, by and through the undersigned Department of Justice \nAttorney, hereby submits this notice of potential future use or disclosure of information acquired \nor derived from four Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) applications targeting Carter \nW. Page (Page) in docket numbers 2016-1182, 2017-0052, 2017-0375, and 2017-0679 (the Page \nFlSAs).  Consistent with the parameters set by the Court for the use or disclosure of Page FISA \ninformation with respect to future litigation brought by Page, see In Re Carter W. Page, docket \nnos. 16-1182, 17-52, 17-375, 17-679, dated June 25, 2020 (J. Boasberg) (June 25, 2020 Order), \nany such future use or disclosure will only be made insofar as necessary to the good-faith \nconduct of the litigation of claims by Page under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) and the \nPatriot Act. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nOn January 7, 2020, the Court ordered the Government to provide information regarding \nthe handling and disposition of information acquired pursuant to the Page FISAs.  In Re Carter \nW. Page, docket nos. 16-1182, 17-52, 17-375, 17-679, dated January 7, 2020 (J. Boasberg) \n(January 7, 2020 Order).  The January 7, 2020 Order was issued following the December 9, 2019 \nrelease of a Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of the Inspector General (OTG) report titled, \n\nReview of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects oft he FBI's Crossfire Hurricane \nInvestigation (the OIG Report), and four letters submitted by the Government pursuant to Rule \nIJ(a) of the Court's Rules of Procedure dated July 12, 2018, October 25, 2019, November 27, \n2019 and December 9, 2019, which detailed material omissions and misstatements with respect \nto the Page FISAs.  On February 5, 2020, the Government filed an initial Response to the Court's \nJanuary 7, 2020 Order (February 5 Response), and filed Supplemental Responses on February \n28, April l7, and October 21, 2020. \nIn the June 25, 2020 Order, the Court analyzed whether the Government's retention, use \nand disclosure of Page FISA information as set forth in its responses comported with certain \nprocedures and criminal provisions ofFISA.  See 50 U.S.C. §§ 180l(h)(l), 1809(a)(2), \n1821(4)(A), and 1827(a)(2).  Based on an exception to Sections 1809(a)(2) and 1827(a)(2) for \nactions necessary to mitigate or prevent the very harms those sections are designed to address, \nthe Court set forth the parameters for the use or disclosure of Page FISA information in five \nlimited circumstances described by the Government and analyzed by the Court.'  Of particular \nrelevance here, the Court held that \"[w]ith regard to any future claims brought by Page seeking \nredress for unlawful electronic surveillance or physical search or for disclosure of the results of \nsuch surveillance or search, the government may use or disclose Page FISA information insofar \nas necessary to the good-faith conduct of the litigation of such claims.\"  !d. at 20.  The \n1  More specifically, following its analysis of applicable FBI minimization procedures as required by \nFISA (§§ 180 I (h)( I) and 1821 (a)(2)), as well as Sections 1809(a)(2) and 1827(a)(2) and certain limited \nexceptions to those criminal provisions of the Act, the Court set parameters for the use or disclosure of \nPage FISA information in the following five circumstances: ( l) certain identified ongoing third-party \nlitigation pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOlA); (2) ongoing and anticipated FOIA and \ncivil litigation with Page; (3) FBI review of the conduct of its personnel involved in the Page \ninvestigation; (4) DOJ OIG monitoring ofthe implementation of one of the recommendations \n(Recommendation 9) stemming from the OIG Report; and (5) the review of the conduct of \nGovernment personnel in the Page and broader Crossfire Hurricane investigations.  ld. at 20-21. \n2 \n\nGovernment advises the Court that Page has now filed administrative claims under the FTCA \nand Patriot Act based on electronic surveillance and physical search authorized by the Page \nFISAs. \nII.  POTENTIAL USE OR DISCLOSURE OF PAGE FISA INFORMATION \nAs noted by the Court, at the time of the June 25, 2020 Order, Page had already filed a \ncomplaint against DOJ alleging \"FOIA and Privacy Act violations, including that he was \nimproperly denied access to his own records.\"  !d. at 12 (citing Feb. 5 Response at 26). \nAdditionally, Page's attorneys had advised DOJ that Page would likely bring more clajms against \nthe government, \"including violations of the Patriot Act, FISA, the Privacy Act, and the Federal \nTort Claims Act.\"  /d.  In anticipation of such future litigation, and consistent with the exception \nto Sections 1809(a)(2) and 1827(a)(2) for actions necessary to prevent the very harms those \nsections are designed to address, the Court found that those sections did not prohibit the use or \ndisclosure of Page FISA information if necessary for the good-faith conduct of\"any future \nclaims brought by Page seeking redress for unlawful electronic surveillance or physical search or \nfor disclosure of the results of such surveillance or search.\" !d. at 20. \nIn October 2020, the National Security Division (NSD) was advised by the Torts Branch \nof the Civil Division of DOJ that Page had filed administrative claims seeking damages under \nboth the FTCA and the Patriot Act based on injuries allegedly caused by unlawful electronic \nsurveillance and physical search.  The Torts Branch further advised that it reasonably expected \nlitigation would arise from these claims and, accordingly, will request the preservation of \nmaterials relevant to the litigation, including Page FISA information.  Of note, these materials \nare likely already being preserved in response to Page's FOIA and Privacy Act claims discussed \nabove; however, the Torts Branch has not finalized its preservation request, and the breadth of \n3 \n\nthe request is not known.  Accordingly, the Government hereby notifies the Court that some \nPage FlSA information will also be retained in response to Page's FTCA and Patriot Act claims, \nand that the Government will only use or disclose Page FISA information insofar as necessary \nfor the good-faith conduct of those claims.  Should the Government ultimately determine that the \ndisclosure of Page FISA information to Page or any third party is necessary for the good-faith \nconduct of Page's FTCA or Patriot Act claims, the Govenunent will notify the Court before \nmaking any such disclosure. \n/1 /J/ } 0.) 0 \nDated:  Respectfully submitted, \n4 ",
