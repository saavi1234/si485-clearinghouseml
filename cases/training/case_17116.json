    "summary": "<p>On February 12, 2019, seven immigrants, Brooklyn Defender Services, and Legal Aid filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging they had a constitutional and statutory right to attend immigration court and removal proceedings in person, instead of by video teleconference hearings (VTC). The plaintiffs sued U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), and associated officials. The plaintiffs sought a declaration that their protections guaranteed by the First Amendment, Fifth Amendment, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and the Rehabilitation Act had been violated. The plaintiffs claimed that they were denied the right to have an in person hearing in front of Immigration Court. According to the complaint, VTC-only hearing have had disastrous effects on detailed immigrants, the ability of their attorneys to effectively represent them, and the efficiency of the immigration court.</p>\r\n<p>The named plaintiffs in this case are seven immigrants who were detained in jails outside of New York City and required to appear for removal proceedings through VTC. Prior to June 2018, detained immigrants had their removal proceedings in person. On June 27, 2018, ICE's New York Field Office announced that the majority of future proceedings would be conducted through VTC. Issues such as the plaintiffs feeling discouraged to testify about sensitive personal information vital to their case via VTC while in the presence of ICE agents and delays due to foreign language interpretation services or accommodations added to the difficulty of testifying. In addition, the plaintiffs alleged that the VTC policy had experienced numerous technological and scheduling challenges, including poor connections, technological failures, over-scheduling, and a limited number VTC lines, resulting in adjourned and delayed hearings and correspondingly increasing immigrants' time in detention.</p>\r\n<p>Prior to this lawsuit, the New York Immigrant Family Unity Program (\"NYIFUP\"), New York City's first-in-the-nation appointed counsel program for detained immigrants who cannot afford an attorney, was able to screen and identify clients in on-site intake interviews at the Varick Street Immigration Court on the day of clients' initial appearances. NYIFUP has increased the rate of successful outcomes by 1,100 percent since 2013. This service reduced unnecessary detention and illegal deportation, representing approximately 35 percent of immigrants in proceedings before the Varick Street Immigration Court. Without the in-person hearings, NYIFUP is unable to identify potential clients.</p>\r\n<p>On February 15, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a motion to certify their class, and on February 26, 2019, they filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to produce detainees to their removal proceedings in person. On April 15, 2019, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss.</p>\r\n<p>On June 21, 2019, Judge Andrew L. Carter filed an opinion and order denying the plaintiff&rsquo;s motions for class certification and for preliminary injunction and approving the defendant&rsquo;s motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. 2019 WL 2568648. Though Judge Carter, a former federal public defender, noted he was \"sympathetic to the plaintiffs' claims,\" he dismissed the case because under &sect; 1252(b)(9) of the INA he was jurisdictionally barred from hearing the action. Under &sect; 1252(b)(9) of the INA, judicial review, including interpretation and application of constitutional and statutory provisions, arising from actions to remove a noncitizen was only available in judicial review of a <em>final</em> order of removal. In this case, because the plaintiffs were challenging part of the process by which removability will be determined, the court did not have jurisdiction.</p>\r\n<p>The next day, on July 22, 2019, the plaintiffs submitted a motion to alter the judgment. In it, they argued that because bond hearings were separate from removal proceedings, the court did have jurisdiction. Judge Carter denied in part and stayed in part that motion in a March 13, 2020, order. 2020 WL 1233761. He rejected the plaintiffs' claim that bond hearings were not part of the removal process, and thus subject to the court's jurisdiction, finding they did not bring this claim in their original complaint. However, he stayed the plaintiffs' claim that the defendants' actions violated the APA in light of <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16132\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Regents of the University of California v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security</a>, which was then pending before the Supreme Court. That case concerned the legality under the APA of the Trump Administration's recision of the DACA program.</p>\r\n<p>The Supreme Court decided <em>Regents of the University of California</em> on June 18, 2020. 140 S. Ct. 1891. Judge Carter asked the parties to submit letters discussing that case's effect on the remaining APA claim on November 9. 2020.</p>\r\n<p>However, after the additional briefing, Judge Carter denied the plaintiffs' remaining claims. 2021 WL 275690. He found that <em>Regents of the University of California</em> did not provide any new support for their claims or allow them to circumvent the jurisdictional issues raised in his June 2019 opinion.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in March of 2021. However, on July 12, 2021, they stipulated to the dismissal of the appeal. The case is now presumably closed.</p>",

This is an action to restore the constitutional and statutory rights of hundreds of \ndetained immigrants by ending Defendants’ exclusive use of video teleconference hearings \n(“VTC”) at Varick Street Immigration Court in New York City.1  \n2.  On June 27, 2018, ICE’s New York Field Office (“ICE NY Field Office” or “NY \nField Office”) announced without warning that it would no longer produce detained immigrants \nto immigration court to attend their removal proceedings in person (“Refusal to Produce Policy” \nor “Policy”).  Instead, removal proceedings for detained immigrants would be conducted \nexclusively over VTC, whereby detained immigrants would appear by video feed from the \ncounty jails at which they are detained.   \n3.  Defendants’ Policy upended the NY Field Office’s long-standing practice of \ntransporting detained immigrants to the Varick Street Immigration Court to appear for their \nhearings in person.  In-person hearings had long helped ensure detained immigrants an \nopportunity to fully access the courts and participate in their removal proceedings.  The ICE NY \nField Office had never previously engaged in a broad refusal to produce individuals for in-person \nhearings.    \n4.  In-person hearings also allowed the New York Immigrant Family Unity Program \n(“NYIFUP”)—New York City’s first-in-the-nation appointed counsel program for detained \nimmigrants who cannot afford an attorney—to flourish.  Until the events giving rise to this \nlawsuit, NYIFUP attorneys were able to screen and identify clients in on-site intake interviews at \nVarick Street Immigration Court on the day of clients’ initial appearances.  Under this system, \nNYIFUP was an immense success.  Since 2013, NYIFUP has increased the rate of successful \n                                                 \n1 Plaintiffs allege on personal knowledge as to matters relating to Plaintiffs, and on information and belief as to all \nother matters. \n1 \n \n\noutcomes for detained immigrants by 1,100 percent, confirming that the services provided by \nNYIFUP attorneys reduce unnecessary detention and illegal deportations.  NYIFUP attorneys \nnow represent approximately 35 percent of immigrants in proceedings before the Varick Street \nImmigration Court. \n5.  Defendants rely on a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act that gives \nimmigration judges discretion to conduct proceedings through VTC.  See 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1229a(b)(2)(A)(iii).  But all VTC proceedings must nonetheless “accord with the constitutional \nrequirements for due process.”  Aslam v. Mukasey, 537 F.3d 110, 114 (2d Cir. 2008).  The ICE \nNY Field Office’s implementation of a VTC-only system has failed to comply with \nconstitutional requirements.   \n6.  Defendants’ VTC-only hearings have had disastrous effects on detained \nimmigrants, the ability of their attorneys to effectively represent them, and the efficiency of the \nimmigration court.  None of the county jails used by the ICE NY Field Office have sufficient \nVTC connections to meet the increasing demand of the Varick Street Immigration Court docket.  \nThis means that detained immigrants with scheduled hearings often do not have access to an \navailable VTC line, and when a line is available, technical failures have been rampant, \npreventing detained immigrants from seeing, hearing, or understanding what is happening in the \ncourtroom.  These problems result in frequent delays and are compounded when detained \nimmigrants require foreign language interpretation services or accommodations due to \ndisabilities.  In addition, the frequent presence of ICE officers in the VTC room from which \ndetained immigrants testify often discourages the immigrants from testifying about sensitive \npersonal information that may be vital to their case.   \n2 \n\n7.  Indeed, at a recent hearing over VTC for Representative Plaintiff J.C.—a detained \nimmigrant with a disability—the immigration judge remarked on the record that he believed \nthere would be a violation of “due process and fundamental fairness” if the ICE NY Field Office \nforced J.C. to appear for his merits hearing by VTC.  The judge elaborated:  “If he appears via \nvideo, I see a problem with that.  I have to protect his constitutional rights and I have an expert \nwho told me that this guy shut down when he interviewed him because of certain technical type \nissues.”  Yet under Defendants’ Policy, J.C. and all other immigrants detained by the ICE New \nYork Field Office are required to appear by VTC.  Defendants’ Policy thus severely hampers \ndetained immigrants’ ability to participate in their hearings and effectively present their case, and \nprevents immigration judges from making adequate credibility determinations in accordance \nwith constitutional and statutory due process protections.   \n8.  Defendants’ Policy also prevents detained immigrants from fully engaging with \ntheir attorneys.  The three NYIFUP organizations—Brooklyn Defender Services, The Bronx \nDefenders, and The Legal Aid Society (collectively “NYIFUP Providers” or “Organizational \nPlaintiffs”)— face unnecessary and growing costs, as their attorneys must now routinely visit the \njails outside of the city for all client matters.  NYIFUP attorneys can no longer conduct intake \ninterviews efficiently or confer with their clients immediately before or after hearings.  Instead, \nattorneys are forced to discuss strategy over the VTC lines, often in the presence of jail officers \nand/or court personnel.  Even more troubling, Defendants’ Policy prevents these lawyers from \nbeing able to confer confidentially with their clients during hearings to provide legal advice, \ndiscuss strategy, or review evidence. \n9.  Defendants implemented the Policy despite knowing that the system-wide use of \nVTC could violate the due process rights of detained immigrants.  For example, a 2017 report \n3 \n\ncommissioned by Defendant EOIR concluded that court proceedings by VTC should be limited \nto “procedural matters” because appearances by VTC may lead to “due process issues.”2  \nDefendants’ Policy thus contradicts the recommendations from their own commissioned study \nregarding the use of VTC.   \n10.  Defendants implemented the Policy without considering its effect on detained \nimmigrants’ constitutional and statutory rights.  Defendants conducted no evaluation of their \ntechnological capacity to implement a VTC-only system or the obstacles such a system would \npose to detained immigrants’ ability to access the courts and their attorneys.  Defendants \nprovided no warning to the NYIFUP providers or to the private bar regarding the policy, nor any \naccommodation to allow NYIFUP attorneys to conduct intake and speak confidentially with their \nclients.   \n11.  Significantly, Defendants have failed to provide an accurate reason for the Policy.  \nThe initial justification for the Refusal to Produce Policy was a purported security threat caused \nby a small group of peaceful and lawful protesters.  But that protest ended the same day that \nDefendants’ announced their new Policy, and it has not returned.  Yet the Policy remains.  To \nexplain this, Defendants have offered evolving rationales.  First it was public safety; then it was \ncost effectiveness; then it was part of a nationwide plan to streamline immigration proceedings; \nthen it was public safety again.  Defendants’ shifting justifications are pretext for their real, \nillegitimate motivation: the government’s nationwide effort to expedite deportations at the \nexpense of due process.   \n12.  The Plaintiffs in this case, P.L., A.Q., K.T., R.F.J., A.R.B., B.M.B., and J.C. \n(collectively “Representative Plaintiffs”), on behalf of the putative class members (“Putative \n                                                 \n2 Booz Allen Hamilton, Department of Justice, Executive Office for Immigration Review Legal Case Study \nSummary Report (“EOIR Report”), April 6, 2017 at 23.  \n4 \n\nClass” or “detained immigrants”3), and the three NYIFUP Providers—bring this challenge to \nenforce the government’s obligations to provide detained immigrants with constitutional and \nstatutory fair-hearing protections, to ensure full and meaningful access to the courts, and to \npreserve the right of clients to associate with their attorneys.   \n13.  Plaintiffs seek a declaration that the Policy as implemented violates protections \nguaranteed by the First Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, the Immigration and Nationality Act \n(“INA”), the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), and the Rehabilitation Act.  Plaintiffs \nfurther seek to enjoin the Policy and enjoin Defendants from relying exclusively on VTC \ntechnology to conduct proceedings before the Varick Street Immigration Court.   \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n14.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331.  The United \nStates has waived sovereign immunity for purposes of this case.  See Polanco v. U.S. Drug \nEnforcement Admin., 158 F.3d 647, 652 (2d Cir. 1998) (noting that “sovereign immunity is \nwaived by the Administrative Procedure Act” when “the complaint seeks only equitable relief”); \nsee also 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 706 (Administrative Procedure Act) (providing the right to judicial \nreview and defining the scope of review).   \n                                                 \n3 Although the term “immigrant” is used for convenience, Plaintiffs note that the proposed class likely includes U.S. \ncitizens wrongfully deemed to be noncitizens by ICE.  See, e.g., Jaen v. Sessions, 899 F.3d 182, 184 (2018) \n(concluding that a Brooklyn Defender Services client detained at the direction of the ICE NY Field Office was, in \nfact, a U.S. citizen); id. at 190–91 and n.2 (Pooler, J., concurring) (expressing concern that immigration officials had \ndetained Mr. Jaen for two years, and noting that his case “does not seem to be entirely aberrational”); Watson v. \nUnited States, 865 F.3d 123 (2d Cir. 2017) (discussing case of New York resident and U.S. citizen Davino Watson, \nwho was held in immigration detention for over three years).  Between 2012 and mid-2018, ICE released over 1,480 \nindividuals from immigration detention after investigating their citizenship claims.  Paige St. John & Joel Rubin, \nICE held an American man in custody for 1,273 days. He’s not the only one who had to prove his citizenship, L.A. \nTimes (Sept. 17, 2018), https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-citizens-ice-20180427-htmlstory.html. \n5 \n\n15.  Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) and (e) because one or more \ndefendants’ place of business is in this District and a substantial part of the events or omissions \ngiving rise to the claim occurred and continue to occur in this District. \n16.  Personal jurisdiction is proper because one or more defendants’ place of business \nis in this District, and the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred and continue to \noccur in this District.   \nPARTIES \n17.

U.S. Const. amend. I. \n42.  The Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. (“INA”), governs \nremoval proceedings.  Proceedings conducted pursuant to the INA must comport with the \nconstitutional requirements for due process, which include procedures that ensure that \nimmigrants receive a full and fair hearing on their claims.  Aslam, 537 F.3d at 114. \n43.  The INA also guarantees immigrants access to counsel during their removal \nproceedings.  Specifically, the INA provides each noncitizen with “the privilege of being \nrepresented, at no expense to the government, by counsel of the alien’s choosing,” the \nopportunity to examine evidence presented against him or her, and the ability to present evidence \non his or her own behalf and cross-examine Government witnesses.  8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(4).   \n44.  The INA contemplates that immigrants may be detained or at liberty during their \nimmigration proceedings.  8 U.S.C. § 1226(a)(1), (2).  Immigrants who are detained pending \ntheir removal proceedings are detained for civil, not criminal proceedings.  See Zadvydas v.  \nDavis, 533 U.S. 678, 690 (2001).  Pursuant to contracts between the county jails and ICE, \nimmigrants detained by the NY Field Office are held in civil immigration detention in county \n12 \n\njails in New Jersey and New York in conditions akin to criminal incarceration.6  As a result, \ndetained immigrants’ access to the outside world, including access to their attorneys, is limited, \nmonitored, and sometimes recorded.   \n45.  While the INA contemplates some removal proceedings potentially being \nconducted through VTC, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(2)(A)(iii), the use of VTC must always “accord \nwith the constitutional requirements for due process.”  Aslam, 537 F.3d at 114.   \n46.  The INA vests immigration judges, employees of EOIR, with the authority to \ncompel in-person production of immigrants from the jails where they are confined to the \ncourthouse for their immigration proceedings.  8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.35(b)(1), 1240.1(c).   \n47.  The Rehabilitation Act requires the government to make reasonable \naccommodations for individuals with disabilities to ensure they can access government benefits \nand opportunities.  29 U.S.C. §§ 701, 794(a). \n48.  As Plaintiffs allege herein, the Defendants’ Policy of exclusively using VTC does \nnot comport with detained immigrants’ and the Organizational Plaintiffs’ constitutional and \nstatutory rights.  \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nRemoval Proceedings in New York City \n49.  Each year, the federal government arrests, detains, and ultimately seeks to remove \nover a hundred thousand immigrants from the United States.7 \n                                                 \n6 Individuals detained by the NY Field Office are typically held at the Hudson County Jail in Kearny, New Jersey, \nthe Bergen County Jail in Hackensack, New Jersey, or the Orange County Jail in Goshen, New York. \n \n7 See, e.g., ICE Impact in FY 2017, https://www.ice.gov/topics/fy2017 (last visited Feb. 10, 2019) (noting that in \n2017, ICE arrested more than 143,000 immigrants and removed more than 81,000 people from the United States). \n \n13 \n\n50.  Defendant ICE is responsible for arresting, processing, and detaining immigrants \nthat Defendant DHS seeks to remove from the United States.  Defendant ICE’s New York Field \nOffice is responsible for processing all arrests and removal cases in the New York City area.8  \nThose immigrants detained by the NY Field Office are held in civil immigration detention in \ncounty jails in New Jersey and New York pursuant to those county jails’ contracts with ICE.   \n51.  For administrative purposes, the immigration courts in New York distinguish \nbetween immigrants who are: a) detained during the pendency of their proceedings and b) those \nwho are released on bond or recognizance, or never detained during proceedings.   \n52.  Proceedings for immigrants detained by ICE—the “detained docket”—generally \ntake place at 201 Varick Street, New York, New York (“Varick Street Immigration \nCourt”).  During fiscal year 2018, the Varick Street Immigration Court processed 1,777 new \ncases of immigrants who were detained following an arrest by ICE.9 \n53.  During fiscal year 2018, the ICE NY Field Office and EOIR jointly processed and \nadjudicated the removal cases of 27,037 immigrants in the New York City area.10    \n                                                 \n8 Defendant ICE maintains two field offices in New York State—the ICE NY Field Office in New York City and the \nBuffalo Field Office. The ICE NY Field Office exercises jurisdiction over proceedings in New York City as well as \nDutchess, Nassau, Putnam, Suffolk, Sullivan, Orange, Rockland, Ulster, and Westchester counties.  Policies and \nprocedures of the Buffalo Field Office are not at issue in this case. \n \n9 See New Deportation Proceedings Filed in Immigration Court, TRACImmigration, \nhttps://trac.syr.edu/phptools/immigration/charges/deport_filing_charge.php.  If a noncitizen is initially detained but \nsubsequently posts bond following a hearing, his or her case generally will be transferred to the non-detained docket \nat 26 Federal Plaza, New York, New York.  However, EOIR has recently begun conducting some proceedings for \nthe detained docket via videoconference at 26 Federal Plaza.  In addition, EOIR has informed the NYIFUP \nProviders that starting in March 2019, it will conduct some proceedings for the non-detained docket in new \ncourtrooms at the Varick Street Immigration Court.  Individuals with removal proceedings pending on the non-\ndetained docket are not members of the putative class.    \n \n10 See id. \n14 \n\nThe Immigrant Representation Crisis and History of NYIFUP \n54.  Immigrants facing deportation are frequently unrepresented.  Removal \nproceedings are the only legal proceedings in the United States where people are detained by the \nfederal government and required to litigate for their liberty against trained government attorneys \nwithout any guaranteed assistance of counsel.  Yet the consequence of these proceedings— \npermanent exile from the United States and separation from family, friends, and loved ones—can \nbe just as severe as, or even more harsh than, criminal imprisonment.   \n55.  The individuals facing deportation are nearly universally vulnerable: they often \nare unfamiliar with the legal system, lack financial resources, face language barriers, and are \nsusceptible to coercion by incompetent or unscrupulous “advocates.” \n56.  In 2010, recognizing the magnitude of problems associated with the low rates of \nlegal representation in immigration proceedings, Chief Judge Robert A. Katzmann of the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Second Circuit11 convened the Study Group on Immigrant \nRepresentation (the “Study Group”).  The Study Group began the New York Immigrant \nRepresentation Study, a two-year study of the immigrant representation crisis in New York. \n57.  In December 2011, the Study Group issued a report titled Accessing Justice:  The \nAvailability and Adequacy of Counsel in Immigration Proceedings.12  The report quantified the \nscale and nature of the barriers to representation faced by noncitizens in removal proceedings.  It \nfound that 60 percent of New York’s detained immigrants did not have legal representation, and \nonly three percent of New York’s detained, unrepresented immigrants achieved successful \n                                                 \n11 Judge Katzmann was appointed to the Second Circuit in 1999 and became the chief judge on September 1, 2013. \n \n12 New York Immigrant Representation Study, Accessing Justice: The Availability and Adequacy of Counsel in \nImmigration Proceedings (Dec. 2011) at 3, https://www.ils.ny.gov/files/Accessing%20Justice.pdf. \n \n15 \n\noutcomes in court.13  The study concluded that many deported immigrants had credible and \nlegitimate bases to lawfully remain in the United States but, without representation, were facing \nunjust removal. \n58.  In 2013, a coalition of equal justice and immigrant rights organizations won the \nsupport of the New York City Council for the creation of the NYIFUP program.  Initially a pilot \nthat in 2014 became fully funded, NYIFUP is the first program in the nation providing publicly-\nfunded counsel to detained immigrants who cannot afford an attorney and are facing deportation \nand separation from their families and communities.   \n59.  Since 2014, New York City has administered the NYIFUP program by \ncontracting with BDS, BxD, and LAS to provide deportation defense for detained immigrants at \nthe Varick Street Immigration Court.  NYIFUP attorneys represent clients in immigration court \nand on appeal and provide ancillary services as needed.   \nNYIFUP Proves an Immense Success \n60.  Since the establishment of NYIFUP in 2014, the NYIFUP Providers have \ndefended thousands of detained immigrants in removal proceedings, won release from ICE \ncustody for over 900 clients, and won cases for over 500 clients.  In 2018, over 700 detained \nimmigrants received representation through the program.  NYIFUP attorneys now represent \napproximately 35 percent of detained immigrants in proceedings before the Varick Street \nImmigration Court. \n61.  The outcomes for detained immigrants have improved dramatically since \nNYIFUP was implemented.  A 2017 evaluation report estimated that 48 percent of NYIFUP \n                                                 \n13 Id. \n16 \n\nclients achieve successful outcomes in their cases.14  Before NYIFUP, the success rate for \nunrepresented detained individuals was just 4 percent.15  This represents a 1,100 percent increase \nin successful outcomes for detained noncitizens at the Varick Street Immigration Court.  These \nresults confirm that the legal representation provided by NYIFUP allows detained immigrants to \nfully and fairly present their case. \nVarick Street Court Proceedings Before June 2018 \n62.  Until the events giving rise to this lawsuit, the ICE NY Field Office had \nmaintained the regular practice of transporting detained immigrants to Varick Street Immigration \nCourt for their immigration hearings. \n63.  Prior to implementation of the Policy, NYIFUP attorneys conducted on-site \neligibility interviews and prepared income assessments in person in a private meeting space at \nthe Varick Street Immigration Court on the day of an individual’s initial appearance.  The vast \nmajority of detained immigrants who appeared at intake qualified for a NYIFUP attorney and \nwere otherwise unrepresented. \n64.  If the NYIFUP attorneys determined that a detained immigrant was eligible for \nNYIFUP services, an attorney was assigned the case and proceeded to conduct a comprehensive \nclient interview and provide initial legal advice.  During the intake process, NYIFUP staff also \nconducted conflicts checks and other administrative steps necessary to their representation.   \n65.  All of these meetings between attorney and client took place in person, one-on-\none, immediately prior to the detained immigrant’s initial immigration court appearance.  During \n                                                 \n14 Jennifer Stave et al., Evaluation of the New York Immigrant Family Unity Project:  Assessing the Impact of Legal \nRepresentation on Family and Community Unity at 6, (Nov. 2017), https://storage.googleapis.com/vera-web-\nassets/downloads/Publications/new-york-immigrant-family-unity-project-evaluation/legacy_downloads/new-york-\nimmigrant-family-unity-project-evaluation.pdf. \n \n15 Id. \n17 \n\nsuch initial meetings, the attorney would discuss the upcoming court proceeding and explore \nhow the client wanted to approach the case.  Later that same day, the attorney would enter an \nappearance on the detained immigrant’s behalf. \n66.  This confidential intake process—which depended on the in-person production of \ndetained immigrants—was critical to the NYIFUP program’s mission of providing universal \nrepresentation for detained immigrants.  Moreover, it provides a reasonable and effective way for \nthe detained immigrant to access and retain counsel.  \n67.  Following the initial appearance, ICE continued to produce detained immigrants \nin person for all remaining hearings in their removal proceedings.  NYIFUP attorneys were able \nto meet with their clients in person at the Varick Street Immigration Court to provide updates on \ntheir case and discuss legal strategy.   \n68.  Because they appeared in person, detained immigrants had the opportunity to \nconsult with counsel before, during, and after hearings in order to confirm strategy, clarify facts, \nreview evidence, or otherwise discuss the day’s proceedings.  Where detained immigrants \nrequired more than a brief consultation with their counsel in the midst of proceedings, attorneys \nwere able to consult in meeting rooms adjacent to the immigration court or to briefly adjourn the \ncase and recall it later that same day, after privately convening with their client.   \n69.  During the proceedings, interpreters were available for detained immigrants who \ncommunicated best in a language other than English.  The majority of these interpreters appeared \nin person and were able to communicate with detained immigrants from a distance of a few feet \nor less.   \n70.  The close physical proximity typically allowed for efficient simultaneous \ninterpretation.  Counsel could monitor the effectiveness and accuracy of the translation.  The \n18 \n\nphysical proximity also provided detained immigrants with a ready opportunity to indicate if \nthey were unable to follow any aspect of the proceeding. \n71.  Where an interpreter was not available in person, one was provided \ntelephonically.  In those instances, the telephonic interpretation was broadcast throughout the \ncourt via a speaker system and the detained immigrant, the judge, the lawyers, and any witnesses \ncould be heard.  And even though the interpreter was interpreting remotely, detained immigrants \ncould at least identify who was speaking throughout the proceedings.  \nICE Implements its Policy of Refusing to Produce Immigrants to Court \n72.  On Monday, June 25, 2018, Defendants suddenly halted in-person production of \ndetained immigrants for proceedings at the Varick Street Immigration Court.  Attorneys from \nNYIFUP and the private bar reported to the Varick Street Immigration Court for the day’s \nproceedings, only to discover that the NY Field Office had refused to produce any of the \nindividuals on the docket.  As a result, all hearings at the Varick Street Immigration Court were \ncanceled, delaying for months that day’s scheduled immigration proceedings.    \n73.  On Wednesday, June 27, 2018, the NY Field Office announced that it would no \nlonger produce detained immigrants for their immigration hearings in person.  Under the Policy, \nimmigrants remain detained at local county jails during the pendency of their removal \nproceedings.  The only opportunity for them to participate in their own proceedings is by VTC \nfrom the county jail where they are detained.   \n74.  The purported justification Defendants provided for the Policy was an unspecified \nsecurity threat to ICE employees, immigration court personnel, and detained immigrants caused \n19 \n\nby a small group of peaceful demonstrators at Varick Street Immigration Court protesting the \nfederal government’s policy of separating children and parent migrants at the southern border.16   \n75.  Protest organizers ceased the protest by midday on June 27.  Yet ICE did not \nrevert to in-person production of detained immigrants and has refused to do so.17 \n76.  Defendants implemented the Refusal to Produce Policy without warning and \nwithout ensuring that the Policy was implemented in a manner that would comply with detained \nimmigrants’ constitutional and statutory rights.  They implemented the Policy with no testing \nperiod to evaluate and address potential technological issues or the obstacles to detained \nimmigrants’ ability to access the courts and their attorneys.  They provided no warning to the \nNYIFUP providers or the private bar regarding the Policy, nor any accommodation to allow \nNYIFUP attorneys to conduct intake and speak confidentially with their clients.  And Defendants \nperformed no evaluation to assess and address the array of interpretation, delay, and other \nproblems caused by the Policy.  Indeed, for the reasons alleged herein, it is unlikely that any \nacross-the-board nonproduction policy could ever meet constitutional and statutory requirements.  \n                                                 \n16 Deepti Hajela, ICE Suspends In-person Hearings at NYC Immigration Court (June 27, 2018), \nhttps://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/new-york/articles/2018-06-27/ice-suspends-in-person-hearings-at-nyc-\nimmigration-court. \n \n17 On December 7, 2018, Defendants advised the Organizational Plaintiffs that ICE would “temporarily resume” in-\nperson production of immigrants housed at Bergen County Jail—one of the three facilities where immigrants are \ntypically detained pending their proceedings at Varick Street Immigration Court—while ICE “continue[s] [its] \nefforts to augment the VTC capacity at that facility.”  And as recently as February 2019, the NY Field Office has \noccasionally produced some immigrants detained at Hudson County Jail for in-person hearings at 26 Federal Plaza, \nin order to avoid problems caused by VTC.  However, the ICE NY Field Office has made clear that it seeks full \nimplementation of VTC-only hearings for all detained immigrants within its custody.  Defendants’ temporary and \npiecemeal production of certain detained immigrants due to the problems caused by VTC is an implicit concession \nthat Defendants’ implementation of VTC has been inadequate and jeopardizes the constitutional and statutory rights \nof detained immigrants.  The piecemeal approach also leads to chaos and unpredictability that further interferes with \nthe rights of detained immigrants and the Organizational Plaintiffs. \n20 \n\nDefendants’ Shifting Policy Justifications \n77.  Defendants’ justifications for the Refusal to Produce Policy have been \ninconsistent and have shifted repeatedly over time.  These purported justifications are merely \npretext for the true reasoning behind the Policy—limiting due process, access to the courts, and \ncounsel for immigrants in an effort to rush deportations and deport more people. \n78.  On June 24, 2018, President Trump responded to the national uproar over his \nadministration’s family-separation policy by tweeting that immigrants who enter the United \nStates without authorization should be deported without due process.18  \n \n79.  ICE implemented its Refusal to Produce Policy just three days later.  ICE \nsuggested that the Varick Street protest posed safety threats to ICE employees, court personnel, \ndetained immigrants, and the general public, and that the Refusal to Produce Policy aimed to \nprotect all involved.  However, ICE did not identify any specific threats, all reports indicated that \nthe protest was peaceful, and the limited protest ended the same day ICE offered this \njustification. \n80.  On July 5, 2018, President Trump’s again tweeted that unauthorized immigrants \nshould be removed from the country without access to courts.19 \n                                                 \n18 Donald Trump (@realDonaldTrump), Twitter (June 24, 2018, 11:02 AM), \nhttps://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1010900865602019329. \n21 \n\n \n \n81.  On July 24, 2018, long after the Varick Street protest ended, ICE re-characterized \nthe purpose and effect of the Policy, explaining that although “[t]he protests may have cleared, [] \nthe misinformation and threats against ICE employees have continued.”20  ICE did not—and to \nthis day has not—identified either any threats against ICE employees or any alleged \nmisinformation. \n                                                                                                                                                             \n19 Donald Trump (@realDonaldTrump), Twitter (July 5, 2018, 7:08 AM), \nhttps://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1014873774003556354; Donald Trump (@realDonaldTrump), Twitter \n(July 5, 2018, 7:16 AM), https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1014875575557804034. \n \n20 Steven Trader, Immigrants’ In-Person Hearings Halted in NYC, Dems Ask Why (July 24, 2018), \nhttps://www.law360.com/articles/1066269/immigrants-in-person-hearings-halted-in-nyc-dems-ask-why. \n22 \n\n82.  On July 31, 2018, ICE changed its story yet again.  ICE stated for the first time \nthat the Policy was “not specific to protesters at the Varick Street location,” contradicting its \nearlier statements, and that the Policy was “not a punishment or retaliation in any way.”21 \nNonetheless, ICE returned to its original explanation, arguing that the Policy was implemented \nnot only to protect ICE employees, but to ensure the safety of the court, the public, and the \ndetainees. \n83.  In late September 2018, the ICE NY Field Office admitted that the Policy was \noriginally implemented “in response to protests, threats, and the possibility of court \ncancellations,” but provided, for the first time, a post hoc rationale: ICE’s refusal to produce \ndetained immigrants was continuing because it was “far more cost effective.”  Defendants \nprovided no cost studies or other data to support this newly-offered justification.  Nor have \nDefendants released information about the costs incurred because of the Policy, such as expenses \nrelated to adopting and maintaining the technology or the financial costs of detaining individuals \nwhose proceedings are prolonged due to VTC-related delay. \n84.  In late October 2018, the ICE NY Field Office offered another new explanation—\nthat the policy shift is part of a larger nationwide plan to stop producing detained immigrants in \ncourt—and claimed that the June 2018 protests expedited the implementation.  The ICE NY \nField Office further represented that a continuing threat to safety stemming from the protests is \nnot the reason for maintaining the Policy.  Instead, Defendants provided the vague justification \nthat the Policy is warranted by cost-effectiveness, efficiency, public or officer safety, and \nmitigation of risk. \n                                                 \n21 Emma Whitford, More Than a Month After Anti-ICE Protests, Detained NYC Immigrants Still Denied In-Person \nHearings (July 31, 2018), https://theappeal.org/more-than-a-month-after-anti-ice-protests-detained-nyc-immigrants-\nstill-denied-in-person-hearings/. \n23 \n\n85.  In early November 2018, the ICE NY Field Office reverted to its original \nrationale, implying that security and safety concerns were the chief motivation behind the policy \nchange, pointing to the June 2018 protests, a 2015 breach of security unrelated to transporting \nimmigrants to the Court, and three court cancellations due to inclement weather in 2017 and \n2018.   \n86.  No protests have been reported at the Varick Street Immigration Court since the \npeaceful and lawful demonstrations in June 2018, and ICE has not identified any ongoing safety \nthreat.  Meanwhile, proceedings in the immigration courts have been thoroughly disrupted by the \nuse of VTC, creating a far less efficient system that has resulted in repeated delays and \nadjournments in removal proceedings for detained immigrants in Defendants’ custody. \nGovernment Study Concludes VTC Causes “Due Process Issues” \n87.  In April 2017, Defendant EOIR commissioned a study of the United States’ \nimmigration system and the growing number of pending cases in the immigration courts.  The \nstudy specifically examined the use of VTC as a means for conducting immigration hearings.   \n88.  The EOIR Report also recognized that “[i]t is difficult for judges to analyze eye \ncontact, nonverbal forms of communication, and body language over VTC.”22   \n89.  The EOIR Report went so far as to state that “[f]aulty VTC equipment, especially \nissues associated with poor video and sound quality, can disrupt cases to the point that due \nprocess issues may arise.”  It found that 29 percent of staff reported that VTC caused “a \nmeaningful delay in their ability to proceed with their daily responsibilities.”23 \n                                                 \n22 EOIR Report at 23. \n \n23 Id.  \n24 \n\n90.  Because of the due process issues caused by VTC, the EOIR Report advised \nagainst the blanket use of VTC, recommending instead that use of VTC should be limited to \n“procedural matters.”24 \n91.  The EOIR Report is not alone in concluding that the blanket use of VTC—the \nvery system Defendants seek to use for all detained immigrants in the custody of the ICE NY \nField Office—creates due process problems.  A June 2017 Government Accountability Office \nstudy of immigration court backlogs and operational challenges (“GAO Study”) expressed \nconcern that the use of VTC in lieu of in-person hearings “could have an effect on the outcomes \nof those immigration hearings.”25   \n92.  The GAO Study reported that “immigration court officials, experts, and \nstakeholders . . . expressed concern that the use of VTC technology poses challenges for holding \nimmigration hearings” and noted that court officials conducting hearings via VTC regularly \nencountered “difficulties maintaining connectivity, hearing respondents, exchanging paper \ndocuments, conducting accurate foreign language interpretation, and assessing the demeanor and \ncredibility of respondents and witnesses.”26   \n93.  Immigration court officials interviewed for the GAO Study conceded that “they \nhad changed their assessment of a respondent’s credibility that was initially made during a VTC \nhearing after holding a subsequent in-person hearing.”27   \n                                                 \n24 Id. \n \n25 Immigration Court: Actions Needed to Reduce Backlogs and Address Long-Standing Management and \nOperational Challenges, GAO 17-438 at 157 (“GAO Study”), https://www.gao.gov/assets/690/685468.pdf. \n \n26 Id. at 55. \n   \n27 Id. \n25 \n\n94.  The report noted that one immigration judge “does not like to hold VTC hearings \nbecause it is sometimes hard to hear and fully comprehend what is being said over VTC, which, \naccording to this judge, can make it difficult to assess the respondent’s demeanor and \ncredibility.”28   \n95.  In addition to these studies, line attorneys for Defendant DHS have recently made \nthe same argument.  In opposing motions for telephonic testimony by a third-party expert \nwitness, they have asserted that “[t]he optimal way of conducting a trial is for the witness to \nappear in person in court to face both parties and to be subject to cross-examination in their \npresence.”  This is all the more true when it comes to the testimony of individuals subject to the \nremoval proceedings, for whom the credibility determination is paramount.     \n96.  Indeed, the numerous problems with VTC identified by the EOIR Report, GAO \nStudy, and Defendant DHS are the exact problems suffered by Plaintiffs and the Putative Class.  \nAssistant Chief Immigration Judge (“ACIJ”) Daniel Daugherty has even submitted a declaration \nin a separate case in this District, Vazquez Perez v. Decker, Case No. 1:18-cv-10683, in which he \nattests to this very fact.  He states that Defendants’ Policy “has created challenges in getting \nenough access to [VTC] lines” for “a majority of individuals scheduled for initial hearings at \nVarick Street.”  Declaration of the Honorable Daniel J. Daugherty at 9, Vazquez Perez v. Decker, \n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 28, 2019), Case No. 1:18-cv-10683 (Doc. 67).  The declaration explains that \nwhen Defendants implemented their policy, “only one of three VTC lines in Bergen County Jail \nwas operable, and had to be shared with state county courts, which limited the number of \nhearings that Varick Street could hold.”  Id.   \n                                                 \n28 Id. at 58. \n26 \n\n97.  A memorandum of law filed in that case by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern \nDistrict of New York further concedes that ICE’s refusal to produce detained immigrants “to the \nVarick Street Immigration Court for proceedings” has “created challenges for the timely \nscheduling of hearings.”  Memorandum of Law in Opposition re: Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction at 21, Vazquez Perez v. Decker, Case No. 1:18-cv-10683 (Doc. 71). \nDefendants’ Policy Harms the Representative Plaintiffs and Putative Class \n98.  Defendants’ Policy impedes detained immigrants’ rights to due process, access to \ncourts and counsel, and associated statutory rights.  Under the Policy, Representative Plaintiffs \nand the Putative Class are neither provided the opportunity to fully participate in their \nproceedings nor have they had adequate access to confidential communications with counsel.  \nThe rampant technical failures of Defendants’ VTC-only hearings violate Representative \nPlaintiffs’ due process rights afforded by the Constitution and the INA.   \nDefendants’ Policy Causes Repeated Adjournments \n99.  The Refusal to Produce Policy causes repeated adjournments that substantially \ndelay the resolution of immigration cases due to limited VTC lines and technological failures, \nneedlessly prolonging detention.   \n100.  Hudson County Jail has only three VTC lines while the other two facilities, \nBergen and Orange, have only one line each.  These lines can each only be used for a single \nVTC call at a time.29 \n                                                 \n29 Defendants have repeatedly recognized the need for additional VTC lines.  In late October 2018, the ICE NY \nField Office stated that it would be increasing to four VTC lines at Hudson within in a matter of days and an \nincrease to three lines at Bergen was not far behind.  The ICE NY Field Office reiterated this promise about \nadditional VTC lines at Hudson and Bergen in early November.  To date, ICE has not activated the promised \nadditional lines at any of the facilities where immigrants are confined.  Although additional VTC lines would allow \nfor more efficient hearings, they would not resolve most of the problems described herein, including the disruption \nof attorney-client communications, credibility assessments, and the ability of detained immigrants (especially those \nwith disabilities) to review evidence, present their testimony, and fully participate in their proceedings. \n27 \n\n101.  The result of the shortage of VTC lines and, perhaps more importantly, the result \nof the regular failure of the technology, is severe: immigration judges routinely delay scheduled \nproceedings for hours or adjourn them altogether because no line is available, while the detained \nimmigrants sit in county jails, disconnected from the courtroom where they were scheduled to \nappear.   \n102.  Relatedly, technical failures with the jail VTC lines regularly require immigration \njudges to adjourn hearings that otherwise might have been completed in a single appearance.   \n103.  Detained immigrants often have to wait to learn about the status of their case until \na NYIFUP attorney can come to the jail to meet with them, which often cannot happen until days \nafter a scheduled hearing.  This in turn impedes the client and attorney’s ability to prepare their \ncase. \n104.  ICE’s refusal to produce detained immigrants frequently causes adjournments in \nhearings that prolong detention by months.  For example, Representative Plaintiff R.F.J.’s \nindividual hearing was initially scheduled for August 15, 2018, some eight months after they \nwere first detained.  Because R.F.J’s testimony about their experiences in their country of origin \nwas central to their asylum application, R.F.J. filed a motion for them to be produced in person \nto the Varick Street Immigration Court.  R.F.J. was not produced and was not able to testify at all \nbecause another judge was using the only VTC line to Bergen that day.  As a result, R.F.J.’s \nindividual hearing was rescheduled to November 23, 2018, meaning that R.F.J. would be \ndetained for an additional three months before their case could be heard.   \n105.  On November 23, 2018, the court was able to connect with R.F.J. over VTC, but \nR.F.J. was unable to present all of their evidence in the time allotted.  Due to the backlog on the \n28 \n\nVarick docket caused by the limited number of VTC lines, R.F.J’s case was continued an \nadditional four months to March 22, 2019, while R.F.J. remains in detention.  \n106.  Representative Plaintiff J.C. is cognitively impaired.  J.C.’s individual hearing \nwas originally scheduled for November 2018, but the immigration judge was unable to connect \nto the Hudson County Jail, so the hearing was rescheduled to January 9, 2019.  Because the \nimmigration judge had scheduled more hearings on January 9 than could be accommodated by \nthe limited number of VTC lines, J.C.’s proceedings were postponed yet again.  J.C. had a \ncompetency hearing on January 18, 2019, at which point his individual hearing was scheduled \nfor the next available date, on March 12, 2019.  \n107.  Representative Plaintiff K.T. was scheduled to appear before the immigration \njudge on November 20, 2018.  ICE refused to produce K.T. to the Varick Street Immigration \nCourt from the Orange County Jail.  K.T. arrived at the VTC office in the jail for his appearance \naround 8:30 a.m., at which point an officer at the jail told K.T. to wait.   \n108.  That morning, K.T.’s immigration judge had previously connected to the sole \nVTC line at the Bergen County Jail.  The judge explained to K.T.’s attorney that he did not want \nto disconnect from the Bergen line in order to connect to the Orange line for fear that another \njudge would begin using the only Bergen line.  About three and a half hours after K.T. arrived at \nthe VTC office, the officer at the Orange County Jail called Varick to ask when K.T.’s case \nwould be heard.  K.T. learned that his attorney had appeared and that his case was adjourned, in \npart because K.T. was not present.  K.T.’s individual hearing is now scheduled to take place in \nApril 2019. \nDefendants’ Policy Prevents Detained Immigrants from Participating in their Proceedings \n109.  None of the county jails where the Putative Class members are detained have \nsufficient VTC capability to meet the demands of the New York Field Office’s detained docket.  \n29 \n\nTechnological failures have been rampant since the implementation of the Policy, frequently \ncreating sound and sight barriers between the courtroom and the detained immigrants.  Even if \nDefendants were to provide additional VTC-connected rooms at detention facilities, the \nwidespread and systemic shortcomings of the VTC system would not be remedied.   \n110.  For example, detained immigrants are often only able to see a narrow slice of the \ncourtroom and the camera often does not track if a different person—including their attorney or \nthe government’s attorney—begins to speak.   \n111.  Similarly, when a speaker moves even inches away from a microphone, it \nbecomes difficult for detained immigrants to hear over VTC and sound often cuts out entirely, \ncausing the detained immigrants to miss critical testimony or instructions from the judge.   \n112.  Often, the detained immigrants cannot object because they do not realize they are \nmissing some aspect of the proceeding since they cannot see or hear the person who is speaking. \nTherefore, they cannot know whether the person said something that they missed.   \n113.  Unreliable technology also causes breaks in the video or audio feed.  These \nlimitations are significantly compounded when the individual requires foreign language \ninterpretation.  Immigration judges are therefore required to determine the fate of immigrants \nwho they often cannot see or hear and whose credibility they cannot reliably assess.   \n114.  Due to the failure of the VTC technology, attorneys are frequently forced to \nchoose either to waive their client’s right to appear, or to request an adjournment that subjects \ntheir client to additional and potentially unnecessary detention.  Immigration judges often \nencourage attorneys to waive their clients’ right to appear to avoid a continuance of several \nmonths, thereby undermining the detained immigrants’ right to fully and meaningfully \nparticipate in the proceedings. \n30 \n\n115.  For example, Representative Plaintiff A.R.B., who is detained at Bergen jail, was \nscheduled for a master calendar hearing on November 29, 2018.  ICE refused to produce A.R.B. \nin person that day, and because of a VTC malfunction, A.R.B. was unable to participate in the \nhearing in any capacity.  Rather than explain to A.R.B. that his hearing had been delayed because \nof problems with the VTC connection, an ICE officer at the jail falsely told him it was because \nhis attorney was not in court. \n116.  A.R.B.’s case was then adjourned to the next day.  The following day, the court \ntried for three hours and again failed to connect with A.R.B. over VTC because another judge \nwas using the one VTC line to Bergen all day.  To avoid continued delays to schedule a master \ncalendar hearing, A.R.B.’s appearance was waived so that the court could schedule an individual \nhearing date.  A.R.B.’s individual hearing is now scheduled for March 20, 2019.   \nDefendants’ Policy Prevents Detained Immigrants from Retaining Counsel, Reviewing \nEvidence, and Assisting in their Cases \n117.  Because of the Policy, Representative Plaintiffs and the Putative Class members \ncannot effectively assist in their own defense in these proceedings.   \n118.  In the first instance, attorney intake of potential clients has become severely \ndisrupted.  Before the Refusal to Produce Policy, NYIFUP attorneys could meet with potential \nclients at the Varick Street Immigration Court before their initial appearances.  \n119.  Under the Policy, the shortage of VTC lines routinely interferes with the ability of \nNYIFUP providers to intake detained immigrants prior to their initial hearings.  Attorneys cannot \ngenerally screen prospective clients ahead of their first court appearances, except in very limited \ncircumstances.  The only way detained immigrants can retain an attorney before their initial \nappearance is if attorneys are able to travel to the jails or if immigration judges allow attorneys to \nuse limited VTC lines in their courtrooms when they are not in use for court proceedings.   \n31 \n\n120.  Because neither scenario is effective in practice, detained immigrants must often \nappear pro se for their initial appearances.  Indeed, on several occasions in December 2018, VTC \nline shortages resulted in detained immigrants being forced to appear pro se at their initial \nhearings because NYIFUP providers were not able to screen these potential clients prior to the \nstart of the hearings.   \n121.  And although attorneys are usually unable to conduct intake screening interviews \nover the VTC system, on the occasions that they are provided that opportunity, the presence of \nother people in both the courtroom and the detention centers significantly compromises \nconfidentiality. \n122.  Importantly, NYIFUP attorneys are often unable to access their prospective \nclients’ files and the government’s evidence against them prior to their first court date since they \ncan no longer obtain the necessary signed waivers during intake before the detained immigrants’ \ninitial appearances.  Therefore, attorneys have no way to assess potential clients’ cases or advise \nthem prior to their first appearance.  This impedes the ability of detained immigrants to make \ninformed decisions at their initial appearance.  It is also inefficient and ineffective for both \nclients who will continue to oppose their removal and for those who may choose to accept an \norder of deportation.  The latter group cannot be made aware of that option or express their \nwillingness to do so to counsel.  As a result, those detained immigrants are subject to \nunnecessary prolonged detention. \n123.  For example, detained immigrant N.A.R.’s attorney was not able to obtain \nevidence related to his case from the government until several weeks after he first appeared.  \nUpon review of the evidence, N.A.R.’s attorney determined that his case would result in \nmandatory detention and he would be ineligible for bond.  If N.A.R.’s attorney had been able to \n32 \n\nreview his case and advise him of this important fact at intake, N.A.R. may have taken an order \nof removal on his first appearance.  Instead, N.A.R. waited an additional month in detention only \nto take removal at his second scheduled hearing. \n124.  In addition, people detained by ICE are sometimes unaware that they are actually \nU.S. citizens, non-deportable lawful permanent residents, or even eligible for immigration relief.  \nBefore the Policy, NYIFUP attorneys could advise these people of their grounds to remain in the \ncountry before their initial appearance.  Under the Policy, there is no opportunity for NYIFUP \nattorneys to timely advise such individual of their options, and some may accept orders of \ndeportation at their initial appearance. \nDefendants’ Policy Prevents Confidential Communications with Counsel  \n125.  The Policy restricts the Representative Plaintiffs and Putative Class members’ \nability to communicate confidentially with counsel.   \n126.  As described above, Defendants’ Policy severely impedes detained immigrants’ \nability to obtain and consult with counsel before their first-scheduled court appearance.  Now, \nattorney-client communications generally take place only when attorneys are able to access and \nspeak with potential clients in county jails or over limited VTC lines. \n127.  The Policy also severely limits the ability of NYIFUP attorneys to engage in \nconfidential meetings with their clients throughout the representation.  Because ICE refuses to \nproduce detained immigrants to Varick Street Immigration Court for their proceedings, attorneys \ncan no longer consult with their clients in person at the court.   \n128.  Under the Policy, confidential meeting space at the county jails is even more \nlimited than it was before.  Yet even when confidential meeting space is available, NYIFUP \nattorneys must compete for that space with criminal defense attorneys or other immigration \n33 \n\nattorneys meeting with their clients in the same facility, causing delays and long wait times and \nleading to hurried, limited meetings between counsel and client. \n129.  Because ICE has not provided adequate confidential meeting space for detained \nimmigrants to meet with their attorneys, NYIFUP attorneys must frequently resort to using VTC \nlines to relay important information to their client.  Those discussions, when not disrupted by \ntechnical failures, are not reliably confidential and are often interrupted by other people entering \nthe courtroom.  \n130.  Opportunities for confidential communications during immigration court \nproceedings are even further compromised.  There is no way for detained immigrants to speak \nconfidentially with their lawyers in the courtroom without suspending the entire proceeding and \nthe court’s docket.  Because lawyers and their clients can no longer conduct brief confidential \ndiscussions or review documents privately in person, everyone—the judge, court staff, \ngovernment attorneys, witnesses—must clear the courtroom so that the attorney and client can \nspeak over the courtroom’s VTC line.  However, judges are often reluctant to clear the \ncourtroom for such communications, and typically adjourn the case for weeks or months to avoid \ndelaying all other proceedings scheduled for the day.   \n131.  In contrast, when clients who were produced in person needed to speak with their \nattorneys during the proceeding, the attorney could ask for the case to be suspended until second \ncall later in the day.  At that point, the attorney could meet with the client in the private attorney-\nclient meeting space outside the courtroom.  Meanwhile, the immigration judge could continue \nworking through their docket. \n132.  On occasions when a judge does clear the courtroom to provide for an attorney-\nclient discussion, the discussion is limited in time and is rarely confidential as attorneys, \n34 \n\ncourtroom clerks, and judges often pass through the courtroom or can hear the discussion on the \nother side of closed doors.  At times, government attorneys have refused to leave the room to \nallow for confidential communications with the client.  Moreover, officers from the county jails \nand ICE frequently enter the rooms where the detained immigrants are located during such VTC \ncalls.  \n133.  For example, Representative Plaintiff P.L. has been forced to appear by VTC for \nfour immigration hearings.  On two occasions, P.L. was asked questions by the immigration \njudge that he did not fully understand.  P.L. wanted to confer with his attorney to make sure he \nunderstood the questions.  But because P.L. was appearing over VTC, he could not speak with \nhis attorney confidentially before answering the immigration judge.   \n134.  Likewise, during a master calendar hearing on September 14, 2018, the attorney \nrepresenting detained immigrant J.S.V. asked to speak with her client confidentially to decide \nwhether to ask for an adjournment to seek relief or accept an order of deportation that day.  \nBecause ICE refused to produce J.S.V. in person, the immigration judge agreed to clear the \ncourtroom and allow J.S.V. to speak with his attorney confidentially via VTC.  Nonetheless, the \njudge and the government attorney entered the room several times during the short conversation, \ncompromising the confidential nature of the communications.  J.S.V. accepted the order of \ndeportation that day and was subsequently deported. \n135.  During his hearings over VTC, Representative Plaintiff K.T. appeared from a \nVTC room in the Orange County Jail that ICE officers also use as an office.  The screen for the \nVTC connection was on one side of a table and the ICE officers’ computer screen was on the \nother side of the same table.  ICE officers remained in the room during K.T.’s hearings.  Further, \na chair was stationed directly outside the office door for the next detained immigrant waiting for \n35 \n\ntheir VTC hearing.  The door has remained open during K.T.’s hearings and it was possible for \nthe person waiting outside to overhear the court proceedings being broadcast via VTC. \n136.  Instead of clearing a courtroom, many immigration judges simply adjourn cases—\nsometimes for months—to facilitate the need for a client to confer confidentially with their \nattorney and allow the court to move on to the next case on the docket.  This often occurs \nregardless of the length of time needed by the attorney and client to confer, and uniformly results \nin additional time in the county jail. \n137.  Detained immigrants and their attorneys are thus frequently faced with an \nimpossible choice between engaging in confidential, necessary communications that will delay \ntheir case and result in prolonged detention versus proceeding without those conversations, \nthereby missing information that could be critical to preserving their rights.   \n138.  Before the Policy, these types of confidential communications—intake interviews \nand eligibility determinations, signing retainer agreements, and attorney-client consultations \nduring hearings—were routinely completed without adjournments. \nDefendants’ Policy Prevents Effective Foreign Language Interpretation Services \n139.  The issues surrounding VTC are compounded in proceedings that require the use \nof foreign language interpreters.  Because of their absence from the courtroom and ICE’s failure \nto provide an adequate system of interpretation, the Putative Class members are unable to \neffectively communicate with interpreters in the courtroom.   \n140.  Under the Policy, interpretation over VTC is delayed and difficult, if not \nimpossible, to understand, and immigration judges often urge attorneys forego simultaneous \ninterpretation.  Interpreters often resort to consecutive interpretation, which refers to \ninterpretation provided after a delay, with attorneys, judges, and other witnesses pausing after a \n36 \n\nsentence or two of speaking in order for the interpreter to interpret.  Consecutive interpretation is \nless effective, less accurate, and results in unnecessarily long proceedings that can often \nnecessitate adjournments.   \n141.  The impact is even more severe for detained immigrants who require telephonic \ninterpretation because an in-person interpreter who speaks the relevant language is not available.  \nIn those cases, an interpreter in a remote location interprets the court proceedings over a phone \nline piped into the courtroom.   \n142.  Thus, detained immigrants participating in the hearings lack a direct line to \ninterpreters—the connection travels over the interpreter’s phone line, through the courtroom \nspeakers, is picked up by microphones in the courtroom, and then through the VTC line.  The \nissue similarly impacts interpreters’ ability to hear the detained immigrants, as the connection \nmust first travel over VTC and then through the phone line.  Hearing telephonic interpretation \nclearly through both a VTC line and a telephone line is nearly impossible for detained \nimmigrants and for the interpreters.   \n143.  During a July 31, 2018 hearing, one immigration judge had to adjourn \nproceedings because the interpreter—conducting interpretation by speakerphone into the \ncourtroom—heard feedback and could not follow what was happening in the courtroom.  \nMeanwhile, the respondent in the case strained to hear the interpretation through the VTC \nconnection.  After the detained immigrant’s attorney noted multiple interpretation errors on the \nrecord, the immigration judge adjourned the proceeding.   \nDefendants’ Policy Impedes Credibility Assessments by Immigration Judges  \n144.  The Refusal to Produce Policy creates additional, often insurmountable, hurdles to \nassessing credibility, a critical component of many immigration proceedings.  Outcomes in \n37 \n\nimmigration cases frequently depend on the immigration judge’s ability to evaluate whether the \ndetained immigrants testified credibly and persuasively.   \n145.  An immigrant facing removal always has “the burden of establishing that he or \nshe is eligible for any requested benefit or privilege and that it should be granted in the exercise \nof discretion.”  8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d).  The immigrant’s credibility is critical to meeting that \nburden. \n146.  In the case of asylum and other claims for discretionary relief, an immigration \njudge’s credibility determination decides an immigrant’s fate; that credibility determination can \ndictate whether the individual will be able to stay in the United States exiled to a place where \nthey fear persecution.  Indeed, an immigration judge may grant an application for asylum based \non credible testimony alone.  See Matter of Dass, 20 I. & N. Dec. 120, 124 (BIA 1989); see also \n8 C.F.R. § 208.13(a).   \n147.  Because ICE refuses to produce detained immigrants in person, immigration \njudges must make critical determinations based on blurry images or unclear voices that are \nfrequently interrupted by technical failures and logistical difficulties. \n148.  Immigrants also often face impediments to providing complete testimony during \nhearings held over VTC that impact a judge’s ability to assess their credibility.  Detained \nimmigrants testifying from jail are forced to testify in rooms that are not private, either due to the \npresence of ICE officers or other inmates, or allegedly private booths that are not soundproof and \nwhere they can be overheard by facility staff or other detained individuals.   \n149.  The presence of those officers and other detained people—whom the immigration \njudge cannot see, since they are typically outside the video frame—can serve as a deterrent to a \n38 \n\ndetained immigrant who seeks to testify about the conduct of government officials or about \nsensitive aspects of his identity or past that he does not wish others in the jail to learn. \n150.  For example, Representative Plaintiff A.Q. was scheduled to appear on August 1, \n2018 for an individual hearing where the immigration judge would consider his application for \nrelief under the Convention Against Torture.  ICE refused to produce A.Q. in person, leaving the \nonly option to appear by VTC.   \n151.  During the hearing, A.Q. asked the officers stationed outside the room where he \nwas testifying to close the door.  When they ignored his request, A.Q. told the judge that the door \nwas open and he was uncomfortable because of the sensitive nature of his testimony.   \n152.  The judge told A.Q. to ask the officers to close the door, but again he was \nignored.  After repeated requests, the judge summoned the officers into the room where A.Q. \nwas testifying and instructed them to close the door.   \n153.  At that point, the officer removed the doorstop but left the door ajar.  A.Q. \nrepeated the judge’s instruction to the officer, who responded that the officer needed to be able to \nhear the proceeding.   \n154.  A.Q. was forced to choose between reiterating the judge’s instruction to the \nofficer (and possible retaliation from the officer) and proceeding with sensitive testimony in \nfront of the officers.  A.Q. decided to continue his testimony.  When the DHS lawyer asked \nabout his sexual orientation, A.Q. wanted to clarify his answer and provide additional context but \nwas afraid to do so because of the presence of the officers.   \n155.  Because ICE refused to produce A.Q. in person for the hearing, and because a jail \nofficer remained within earshot, he felt uncomfortable providing relevant information to his \napplication for relief via VTC.  The judge was therefore not able to properly evaluate A.Q.’s fear \n39 \n\nof returning to his country of origin or the weight of evidence that he presented.  The court \nultimately denied A.Q.’s petition under the Convention Against Torture on grounds that his \nclaims were speculative. \n156.  Similarly, Representative Plaintiff R.F.J.’s proceedings involve testimony \nregarding deeply personal matters relating to their sexual orientation and gender identity.  Under \nthe Policy, R.F.J. will likely have to present that testimony while accompanied by ICE officers in \nthe VTC room at Bergen.  R.F.J. believes that the officers may share R.F.J’s story with other \nofficers or inmates and subject R.F.J. to worsened harassment within the jail.  R.F.J. fears that \nthe presence of officers will affect their ability to provide their full testimony. \nDefendants’ Policy is Particularly Harmful to Detained Immigrants with Disabilities  \n157.  The impact of these negative effects is multiplied for individuals with disabilities.  \nDefendants’ Policy increases the risk that individuals with disabilities will not be identified or \nwill not be able to adequately access the court or their attorneys.   \n158.  Poor video and audio quality on VTC lines often causes severe cognitive and \nintellectual disabilities to go unnoticed.  For those immigrants who are unrepresented or \ninteracting with their attorneys for the first time over a VTC line, signs of cognitive \nimpairment—often marked by poor motor skills—are difficult to observe and thus can be \noverlooked by attorneys and judges with only a narrow view of the person’s head.   \n159.  The GAO Study reported that one immigration judge conceded he was unable to \nidentify a respondent’s cognitive disability when conducting the proceeding via VTC, but that \nthe impairment was “clearly evident” in person.30  Defendants’ Policy renders such in-person \nobservations impossible to the significant detriment of Putative Class members. \n                                                 \n30 GAO Study at 55. \n40 \n\n160.  Even when a detained immigrant’s disability is identified, Defendants’ Policy \nprevents them from receiving necessary accommodations that would allow them to adequately \nparticipate in their removal proceedings.  \n161.  Representative Plaintiff P.L. has been diagnosed with unspecified schizophrenia \nspectrum and other psychotic disorder.  He has indications of significant cognitive defects, \nespecially concerning attention, memory, and visual and spatial abilities.  However, his disability \nis not immediately evident to people interacting with him. \n162.  After his arrest by ICE, P.L. appeared in person at the Varick Street Immigration \nCourt on June 7, 2018, prior to the adoption of the Policy.  During that hearing, he was able to \nsee and hear the judge clearly, communicate with the court via Spanish-language interpretation, \nand ask questions about issues he did not understand. \n163.  Since the implementation of the Policy, ICE has refused to produce P.L. in person \nfor four hearings in his immigration case.  Instead, P.L. participated in the hearings over VTC. \n164.  During each hearing, P.L. relied on a Spanish-language interpreter to understand \nwhat was happening in the immigration court.  Because of poor sound quality over the VTC line, \nP.L. has had difficulty hearing the interpretation.  That difficulty is further complicated because \nthe interpreter is not visible on the VTC screen.  When the interpreter tries to provide \nsimultaneous, as opposed to consecutive, interpretation, the problem is even more severe. \n165.  When P.L. watches a hearing by VTC, he can only see the judge, not the \ninterpreter or either of the attorneys.  Because of his mental illness and cognitive difficulties, \nP.L. has difficulty focusing.  Appearing by VTC exacerbates these challenges. \n166.  Representative Plaintiff A.Q. has been diagnosed with PTSD and has borderline \nintellectual functioning.  He has a low IQ but high adaptive functioning, i.e., he can generally \n41 \n\ntake care of himself, and his disabilities are not immediately apparent to those who interact with \nhim.   \n167.  A.Q. was scheduled to appear on August 1, 2018 for an individual hearing where \nthe immigration judge would consider his application for relief under the Convention Against \nTorture.  The judge would not have been readily able to ascertain that A.Q. had cognitive issues \nfrom the VTC feed.  His attorney argued that he should be produced in person.  The request was \ndenied, and A.Q. appeared via VTC.  His application for relief was ultimately denied, and he is \nnow appealing the decision.   \n168.  Representative Plaintiff B.M.B. has been diagnosed with PTSD, major depressive \ndisorder, and a major neurocognitive disorder due to a traumatic brain injury.  These disorders \nmean that B.M.B. has difficulty remembering and understanding events he must testify about as \npart of his application for relief.  As a result of his mental health status, B.M.B. also has an \nerratic speech pattern, which has made working with interpreters difficult.   \n169.  B.M.B.’s individual hearing was originally scheduled for September 11, 2018, but \nit was delayed to October 2018 due to scheduling difficulties.  During the October hearing, \nB.M.B. testified by VTC about traumatic events he experienced as a child as well as his fear of \nreturning to his country of origin.  At multiple points during his testimony, he sobbed \nuncontrollably for several minutes each time.   \n170.  Although the immigration judge took short breaks in response, no one was with \nB.M.B. to console him.  B.M.B.’s direct testimony continued for about two hours, lengthened in \npart because the interpreter had difficulties following B.M.B.’s speech pattern.  This meant that \n42 \n\nthere was not sufficient time to complete his case, and B.M.B.’s hearing was continued to \nJanuary 15, 2019, approximately four months later.31   \n171.  Ultimately, the immigration judge found B.M.B.’s testimony about his fear of \nreturning to his country of origin not credible and denied him relief.  B.M.B. is appealing the \ndecision and seeks a remand for new proceedings before the immigration judge.   \n172.  Representative Plaintiff J.C. has a cognitive impairment and has difficulty \nfocusing during proceedings.  After evaluating J.C., his psychologist concluded that J.C. does not \n“perform well with any situations that are unfamiliar to him” and therefore that “the use of any \nelectronic or virtual communication will have serious repercussions on his performance.”   \n173.  During J.C.’s competency hearing on January 18, 2019, the immigration judge \nexpressed concern that there would be a violation of “due process and fundamental fairness” if \nJ.C. appeared for his merits hearing over VTC, given his mental limitations.  The immigration \njudge stated that, given the psychologist’s testimony, “[i]f he appears via video, I see a problem \nwith that.  I have to protect his constitutional rights and I have an expert who told me that this \nguy shut down when he interviewed him because of certain technical type issues.”  As the \nimmigration judge noted, “clearly the VTC format would add to that stress for anybody, \nparticularly somebody with first grade level cognitive abilities.” \n174.  Recognizing that the use of VTC may violate J.C.’s constitutional rights, the \nimmigration judge urged ICE to transfer J.C. to the Bergen County Jail before his merits hearing \nso that he could be produced in person (pursuant to Defendants’ temporary practice of producing \nimmigrants detained at Bergen).  The immigration judge stated: “His ability to see what’s going \n                                                 \n31 B.M.B. presented his direct testimony by VTC in October 2018.  But because of Defendants’ temporary \nresumption of in-person production at Bergen, B.M.B. was cross-examined in person at Varick Street Immigration \nCourt on January 15, 2019. \n43 \n\non here is quite limited, which because of his limited cognitive functioning in my opinion will \nclearly add stress.  I’m getting all this just from him being there on the screen today, so it stands \nto reason that if we do a video hearing and [he] starts getting asked cross examination questions, \nhis anxiety is going to ramp up.  I think clearly the government should transfer him to Bergen, so \nthat way he’s physically produced for the hearing.” \n175.  Despite the immigration judge’s significant and express concerns about the use of \nVTC in J.C.’s case, the judge did not exercise his authority to order in-person production for \nJ.C.’s merits hearing.  J.C. has not been transferred by ICE.  His individual hearing is scheduled \nfor March 12, 2019 \nDefendants’ Policy Harms the Organizational Plaintiffs \n176.  Defendants’ Policy has also had a severe negative effect on the NYIFUP program.   \n177.  Specifically, the Policy directly increases the time and cost that the Organizational \nPlaintiffs expend to provide effective legal services to detained immigrants.  As a direct result of \nthe Policy, the Organizational Plaintiffs can no longer screen them for eligibility, conduct initial \ninterviews, or obtain the necessary documents at the time of their initial appearance in \nimmigration court.   \n178.  Instead, NYIFUP attorneys must drive to county jails outside New York City for \nthe sole purpose of conducting eligibility interviews. \n179.  Nor can NYIFUP attorneys engage in confidential communications with their \nclients at the courthouse after their case has commenced.  They must instead travel to the jails \nwhere their clients are held.   \n180.  NYIFUP attorneys typically rent cars to visit their clients, costing the \nOrganizational Plaintiffs thousands of dollars each month. \n44 \n\n181.  Because of travel time and the shortage of confidential meeting space in the jails, \neven a 15-minute conversation with a client regularly takes NYIFUP attorneys away from the \noffice for four or five hours.   \n182.  BDS, BxD, and LAS have each represented and will each represent hundreds of \ndetained immigrants who are adversely affected by the Policy.   \n183.  Defendants’ Policy also interferes with the Organizational Plaintiffs’ ability to \nrepresent their clients during hearings.  Because NYIFUP attorneys often represent clients from \nseveral different jails during the same day, they must be physically present in court while their \nclients appear over VTC.  As a result, NYIFUP attorneys cannot confer with their clients during \nthe proceedings or show them the evidence that is being presented.   \n184.  If a NYIFUP attorney wishes to have a confidential discussion with a client, the \nproceedings must be paused and the entire courtroom must be cleared, a practice that does not \nensure confidentiality and which judges are disinclined to allow given their overcrowded \ndockets.  Often, judges will adjourn the entire proceeding and schedule it for weeks or months \nlater.   \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n185.  Representative Plaintiffs P.L., A.Q., K.T., R.F.J., A.R.B., B.M.B., and J.C. seek to \nbring this action on their own behalf and on behalf of a class of those similarly situated pursuant \nto Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and related to Counts 1-6 \n(“Class Claims”). \n186.  The proposed Plaintiff Class is defined as: “All individuals who are now, or will \nin the future be, detained by the ICE NY Field Office for removal proceedings and who ICE \n45 \n\nand/or EOIR has not produced or will not produce in person for those proceedings pursuant to \nDefendants’ Refusal to Produce Policy.” (“Plaintiff Class”). \n187.  A subclass of persons with disabilities bringing claims under the Rehabilitation \nAct of 1973 is defined as “All individuals who are now or will in the future be detained by the \nICE NY Field Office for removal proceedings who have a disability, as defined by the \nRehabilitation Act, and who ICE has not produced or will not produce in person for those \nproceedings because of Defendants’ Refusal to Produce Policy” (“Rehabilitation Act Subclass” \nor “Subclass”).   \n188.  The Plaintiff Class and Rehabilitation Act Subclass meet all of the requirements \nof Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a).   \n189.  The Plaintiff Class meets the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n23(a)(1) because it is so numerous that joinder would be impracticable.  Although the precise \nsize of the Plaintiff Class is unknown, it is comprised of at least thousands of immigrants who \nare now or will be detained by the ICE NY Field Office in connection with their removal \nproceedings and who are not being or will not be produced in person for those proceedings \npursuant to the Policy.  Just in fiscal year 2018, the ICE NY Field Office filed 1,777 new \ndeportation proceedings at Varick Street Immigration Court, and more members are entering the \nPutative Class every day.32 \n190.  The Rehabilitation Act Subclass meets the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23(a)(1) because it is so numerous that joinder would be impracticable.  Although the \nprecise size of the Rehabilitation Act Subclass is unknown, it is comprised of at least dozens of \n                                                 \n32 See New Deportation Proceedings Filed in Immigration Court, TRACImmigration, \nhttps://trac.syr.edu/phptools/immigration/charges/deport_filing_charge.php. \n \n46 \n\nimmigrants with disabilities who are now or will be detained by the ICE NY Field Office in \nconnection with their removal proceedings and who are not being or will not be produced in \nperson for those proceedings pursuant to the Policy.  The government has previously \nacknowledged that 2 to 5% of all detained immigrants suffer from serious mental illness.33  Other \nsources suggest that the true number is much higher.34  Even adopting the conservative estimate, \nbased on the current and growing number of cases at Varick Street Immigration Court, the \nRehabilitation Act Subclass is sufficiently numerous. \n191.  The Plaintiff Class meets the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n23(a)(2) because class members share common issues of law and fact including, but not limited \nto whether Defendants’ Policy violates the statutory and constitutional rights of the Class and \nSubclass members.   \n192.  The Rehabilitation Act Subclass meets the requirement of Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23(a)(2) because class members share common questions of law and fact including \nwhether members of the class were entitled to accommodations under the Rehabilitation Act and \nwere denied such safeguards by Defendants through implementation of the Refusal to Produce \nPolicy. \n193.  The Plaintiff Class and Subclass meet the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23(a)(3) because the Representative Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of those of the \n                                                 \n33 See Franco-Gonzalez v. Napolitano, No. CV 10-02211, 2011 WL 11705815, at *7 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 21, 2011) \n(“Plaintiffs also point to aggregate government data, reported by ICE in a May 2008 Washington Post article, in \nwhich the government estimated that  2–5% of immigrants in ICE custody suffer from serious mental illness.”) \n(citing Selected responses from ICE to questions posed by The Washington Post regarding the provision of mental \nhealth care to immigration detainees, May 2008, http://media.washingtonpost.com/wp-\nsrv/nation/specials/immigration/documents/day3_ice_mentalhealth.gif (last visited Feb. 7, 2019)). \n \n34 See ACLU, Deportation by Default: Mental Disability, Unfair Hearings, and Indefinite Detention in the US \nImmigration System (July 2010) at 3, https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/usdeportation0710_0.pdf (estimating that “at \nleast 15 percent” of the total immigrant population in detention has a mental disability). \n47 \n\nPlaintiff Class and of the Rehabilitation Act Subclass respectively.  The injuries suffered by the \nRepresentative Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class and the Subclass arise out of the same policy of \nthe Defendants, specifically the Refusal to Produce Policy.  The Representative Plaintiffs’ claims \nare based on the same theories of law as the claims of the Plaintiff Class and Subclass. \n194.  The Plaintiff Class and Subclass meet the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23(a)(4).  The Representative Plaintiffs will adequately represent the Plaintiff Class \nand Subclass because they have a strong personal interest in the outcome of this action, have no \nconflicts of interest with members of the Plaintiff Class or Subclass, and will fairly and \neffectively protect the interests of the Plaintiff Class and Subclass.   \n195.  The Plaintiff Class and Subclass are represented by Brooklyn Defender Services, \nThe Bronx Defenders, The Legal Aid Society, Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, and \nDebevoise & Plimpton LLP.  Counsel for the Plaintiff Class and Subclass have the resources, \nexpertise, and experience to prosecute this action, including expertise and experience litigating \nimmigration law, civil rights, and class actions.  Counsel for the Plaintiff Class and Subclass \nknow of no conflicts among members of the Plaintiff Class and Subclass or between the \nattorneys and members of the Plaintiff Class and Subclass.   \n196.  This action is maintainable as a class action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23(b)(1) because the number of current class members is at least in the hundreds and \nthe prosecution of separate actions by individuals would create a risk of inconsistent and varying \nadjudications, which in turn would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the \nDefendants.  Additionally, the prosecution of separate actions by individual members could \nresult in adjudications with respect to individual members that, as a practical matter, would \nsubstantially impair the ability of other members to protect their interests. \n48 \n\n197.  This action is also maintainable as a class action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23(b)(2) because the Defendants’ policies, practices, actions, and failures that form \nthe basis of this complaint are generally applicable to all members of the Plaintiff Class and the \nRehabilitation Act Subclass, and the injunctive and declaratory relief sought is appropriate and \nwill apply to all members of the Plaintiff Class and Subclass.   \nCOUNT ONE \nDenial of the Right to Procedural Due Process in Violation of the Due Process Clause of the \nFifth Amendment  \n(Representative Plaintiffs, Plaintiff Class, and Rehabilitation Act Subclass) \n198.  The allegations in paragraphs 1 – 197 are realleged and incorporated by reference. \n199.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment forbids the government from \ndepriving an individual of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.   \n200.  The Representative Plaintiffs, Plaintiff Class, and Rehabilitation Act Subclass \nhave a significant liberty interest in being freed from immigration detention and ensuring that \ntheir immigration proceedings comport with due process.   \n201.  Defendants’ Refusal to Produce Policy increases the risk that the Representative \nPlaintiffs, Plaintiff Class, and Rehabilitation Act Subclass will be detained for extended periods \nof time, unable to access available immigration relief, or improperly removed. \n202.  The costs and administrative burden of providing additional, and necessary, \nprocess to the Representative Plaintiffs, Plaintiff Class, and Rehabilitation Act Subclass is \nminimal and would avoid the risks created by the Defendants’ Policy. \n203.  The Representative Plaintiffs, Plaintiff Class, and Rehabilitation Act Subclass \nhave suffered and will imminently suffer irreparable injury as a result of Defendants’ Refusal to \nProduce Policy, and they are entitled to injunctive relief to avoid further injury. \n49 \n\nCOUNT TWO \nDenial of Right to Counsel of Choice in Violation of the INA and APA \n(Representative Plaintiffs, Plaintiff Class, and Rehabilitation Act Subclass) \n204.  The allegations in paragraphs 1 – 203 are realleged and incorporated by reference. \n205.  The Immigration and Nationality Act guarantees the Representative Plaintiffs, \nPlaintiff Class, and Rehabilitation Act Subclass “the privilege of being represented . . . by \ncounsel of [their] choosing” in their removal proceedings.  8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(4)(A). \n206.  Under the Administrative Procedure Act, courts must “hold unlawful and set \naside” agency action that is “not in accordance with law,” “contrary to constitutional right,” in \nexcess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right,” or that is \n“without observance of procedure required by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(D). \n207.  The Representative Plaintiffs, Plaintiff Class, and Rehabilitation Act Subclass are \nrepresented by counsel, primarily attorneys provided through NYIFUP, in their removal \nproceedings. \n208.  Defendants’ Refusal to Produce Policy restricts the ability of the Representative \nPlaintiffs, Plaintiff Class, and Rehabilitation Act Subclass to associate with, seek counsel of, and \ncommunicate confidentially with their attorneys. \n209.  Defendants implemented the Policy in violation of the INA’s right to \nrepresentation by counsel of choice without reasoned explanation and in contradiction of the \nevidence. \n210.  The Representative Plaintiffs, Plaintiff Class, and Rehabilitation Act Subclass \nhave suffered and will imminently suffer irreparable injury as a result of Defendants’ Refusal to \nProduce Policy, and they are entitled to injunctive relief to avoid further injury. \n50 \n\nCOUNT THREE \nDenial of Right to a Full and Fair Hearing in Violation of the INA and APA \n(Representative Plaintiffs, Plaintiff Class, and Rehabilitation Act Subclass) \n211.  The allegations in paragraphs 1 – 210 are realleged and incorporated by reference. \n212.  The Immigration and Nationality Act guarantees the Representative Plaintiffs, \nPlaintiff Class, and Rehabilitation Act Subclass “a reasonable opportunity to examine the \nevidence against [them], to present evidence on [their] own behalf, and to cross-examine \nwitnesses presented by the Government.”  8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(4)(B). \n213.  Under the Administrative Procedure Act, courts must “hold unlawful and set \naside” agency action that is “not in accordance with law,” “contrary to constitutional right,” in \nexcess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right,” or that is \n“without observance of procedure required by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(D). \n214.  Defendants’ Refusal to Produce Policy creates a substantial likelihood that the \nrights of the Representative Plaintiffs, Plaintiff Class, and Rehabilitation Act Subclass to a full \nand fair hearing under the Immigration and Nationality Act will be violated. \n215.  Defendants’ Policy creates a substantial risk that the errors will occur in the \nremoval proceedings of the Representative Plaintiffs, Plaintiff Class, and Rehabilitation Act \nSubclass, and interfere with their rights to examine the evidence against them, to present their \nown evidence, and to cross-examine the Government’s witnesses. \n216.  Despite such harms, Defendants implemented the Refusal to Produce policy \nwithout reasoned explanation and in contradiction of the evidence.  \n217.  The Representative Plaintiffs, Plaintiff Class, and Rehabilitation Act Subclass \nhave suffered and will imminently suffer irreparable injury as a result of Defendants’ Refusal to \nProduce Policy, and they are entitled to injunctive relief to avoid further injury. \n51 \n\nCOUNT FOUR \nDenial of Right to Access Courts in Violation of the First and Fifth Amendments \n(Representative Plaintiffs, Plaintiff Class, and Rehabilitation Act Subclass) \n218.  The allegations in paragraphs 1 – 217 are realleged and incorporated by reference. \n219.  The Petition Clause of the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the \nFifth Amendment guarantee the Representative Plaintiffs, Plaintiff Class, and Rehabilitation Act \nSubclass the right of access to courts and prohibits the government and its agents from \nunjustifiably obstructing that access.   \n220.  This guarantee includes the right of the Representative Plaintiffs, Plaintiff Class, \nand Rehabilitation Act Subclass to communicate with their attorneys.  The Representative \nPlaintiffs, Plaintiff Class, and Rehabilitation Act Subclass therefore have a right to meaningful \naccess to their attorneys in order to defend themselves in their removal proceedings.   \n221.  The Representative Plaintiffs and members of the Plaintiff Class and \nRehabilitation Act Subclass are represented by counsel through the NYIFUP program in their \nremoval proceedings. \n222.  The Refusal to Produce Policy unjustifiably obstructs the ability of the \nRepresentative Plaintiffs, Plaintiff Class, and Rehabilitation Act Subclass to access legal \nrepresentation and interferes with other aspects of their right of access to the courts.   \n223.  The Representative Plaintiffs, Plaintiff Class, and Rehabilitation Act Subclass \nhave suffered and will imminently suffer irreparable injury as a result of Defendants’ Refusal to \nProduce Policy, and they are entitled to injunctive relief to avoid further injury. \nCOUNT FIVE \nViolation of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C.  § 701  \n(Representative Plaintiffs and Rehabilitation Act Subclass) \n224.  The allegations in paragraphs 1 – 223 are realleged and incorporated by reference. \n52 \n\n225.  The Rehabilitation Act requires Defendants DHS and ICE to make reasonable \naccommodations for detained immigrants with disabilities to ensure they can access government \nbenefits and opportunities.  See Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 301 (1985) (“[A]n otherwise \nqualified handicapped individual must be provided with meaningful access to the benefit that the \ngrantee offers.”).   \n226.  The INA and the Board of Immigration Appeals both contemplate numerous \nsafeguards to ensure that a noncitizen is able to fully participate in immigration proceedings.  \nSee, e.g., 8 C.F.R. § 1240.4 (providing that an “attorney, legal representative, legal guardian, \nnear relative, or friend . . . shall be permitted to appear on behalf of” an incompetent noncitizen); \nMatter of M-A-M-, 25 I. & N. Dec. 474, 483 (B.I.A. 2011) (noting that examples of “appropriate \nsafeguards include, but are not limited to, .  .  .  identification and appearance of a family \nmember or close friend who can assist the [noncitizen] and provide the court with information; \ndocketing or managing the case to facilitate the respondent’s ability to obtain legal representation \nand/or medical treatment in an effort to restore competency; [and] participation of a guardian in \nthe proceedings”).   \n227.  Representative Plaintiffs and members of the Plaintiff Class with cognitive and \npsychological disabilities (the Rehabilitation Act Subclass) qualify as persons with a disability \nfor purposes of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  See 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (stipulating that \n“no otherwise qualified individual with a disability .  .  .  , shall, solely by reason of her or his \ndisability” be “denied the benefits of .  .  .  any program .  .  .  conducted by any Executive \nagency”); see also 29 U.S.C. § 705(20)(A) (defining “individual with a disability” to include a \nperson who has a “mental impairment which .  .  .  constitutes or results in a substantial \nimpediment”).   \n53 \n\n228.  Defendants DHS, ICE, and EOIR are Executive agencies within the meaning of \nthe Rehabilitation Act. \n229.  The Rehabilitation Act requires Defendants DHS, ICE, and EOIR to make \nreasonable accommodations for those class members with disabilities to ensure that they are able \nto access the same protections and benefits as other Plaintiff Class members, regardless of their \ndisability.  See 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (requiring heads of Executive agencies to “promulgate such \nregulations as may be necessary” to prevent “individual[s] with disabilities” from “be[ing] \ndenied the benefits of” federal programs “solely by reason of” their disabilities).   \n230.  Despite the need to screen Plaintiff Class members for disabilities, the Refusal to \nProduce Policy prevents government officials, court staff, judges, and even attorneys from \nidentifying those individuals who require a reasonable accommodation.   \n231.  Even where Plaintiff Class members identify themselves, or their attorneys \nidentify them, as individuals with disabilities in need of a reasonable accommodation in the form \nof in-person production, the blanket Refusal to Produce Policy disallows in-person hearings for \nthese class members and prevents them from fully participating in their hearings. \n232.  By enforcing its Refusal to Produce Policy without identifying and providing \nreasonable accommodation for those Plaintiff Class members with disabilities, Defendants DHS \nand ICE discriminate against class members with disabilities in violation of Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act.   \nCOUNT SIX \nArbitrary and Capricious Action in Violation of the APA \n(Organizational Plaintiffs, Representative Plaintiffs, Plaintiff Class, and Rehabilitation Act \nSubclass) \n233.  The allegations in paragraphs 1 – 232 are realleged and incorporated by reference. \n234.  Under the Administrative Procedure Act, courts must “hold unlawful and set aside \n54 \n\nagency action, findings, and conclusions” that are “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, \nor otherwise not in accordance with the law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).   \n235.  Agency action must be overturned “when the agency has relied on factors which \nCongress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the \nproblem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the \nagency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of \nagency expertise.”  Karpova v. Snow, 497 F.3d 262, 268 (2d Cir. 2007) (quoting Motor Vehicle \nMfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)). \n236.  Defendants’ Refusal to Produce Policy reverses years of settled and well-\nconsidered practice without reasoned explanation and in contradiction to the evidence.  The \nPolicy is not necessary to protect ICE officers, court personnel, detained immigrants, or the \npublic from a continuing security threat. \n237.  Defendants entirely failed to consider important aspects of the problem, including \nthe Policy’s interference with due process, detained immigrants’ ability to retain counsel, \nattorney-client communications, and the ability of attorneys to represent their clients.   \n238.  Defendants’ unfounded and inconsistent statements indicate that the stated reason \nfor the Refusal to Produce Policy is pretextual. \n239.  The Organizational Plaintiffs, Representative Plaintiffs, Plaintiff Class, and \nRehabilitation Act Subclass have suffered and will imminently suffer irreparable injury as a \nresult of Defendants’ Refusal to Produce Policy, and they are entitled to injunctive relief to avoid \nfurther injury. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for the following relief: \n55 \n\n1.  Declare that Defendants’ Refusal to Produce Policy violates the First and Fifth \nAmendments of the U.S. Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Administrative \nProcedure Act, and the Rehabilitation Act. \n2.  Permanently enjoin Defendants from relying exclusively on VTC technology to \nconduct removal proceedings for individuals detained by the ICE NY Field Office; \n3.  Permanently enjoin Defendants from requiring members of the Rehabilitation Act \nSubclass to appear for their hearings exclusively via VTC; \n4.  All other injunctive relief necessary to ensure that any use of VTC comports with \nthe constitutional and statutory rights of the Plaintiffs; \n5.  Award Plaintiffs their reasonable fees, costs, and expenses pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  \n§ 2412; and \n6.  Award such additional relief as the interests of justice may require. \nDEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL \nPlaintiffs hereby demand trial by jury on all issues so triable raised by the Class Action \nComplaint.\n56 \n\n________________, 2019  Respectfully submitted,  \n   \n   \n   \nJennifer Williams  Brooke Menschel \nJulie Dona  Jessica Nitsche \nTHE LEGAL AID SOCIETY  Sonia Marquez \n199 Water Street, 3rd Floor  BROOKLYN DEFENDER SERVICES \nNew York, NY  10038   177 Livingston Street, 7th Floor \nTel: (212) 577-3300  Brooklyn, NY 11201 \nClass Counsel   Tel: (718) 254-0700 \n  Class Counsel \nSusan Reagan Gittes    \nPooja A.

Plaintiffs have filed motions for class certification and for a preliminary injunction to \nenjoin Defendants from refusing to produce detained immigrants in person for removal \nproceedings. ECF Nos. 17 & 36. For the reasons set forth below, Plaintiffs' motions are \nDENIED and Defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is \nGRANTED. \nBACKGROUND \nRepresentative Plaintiffs are seven immigrants that were, and in some cases still are, \ndetained in jails outside of New York City and were required to appear for removal proceedings \nthrough video teleconferencing (\"VTC\"). The Organizational Plaintiffs have represented or \ncurrently represent the Representative Plaintiffs and other detained immigrants in removal \n1 The Complaint also names the following government officials in their official capacity as defendants: Deputy \nDirector and Acting Director ofiCE Ronald Vitiello, Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, Acting \nUnited States Attorney General Matthew G. Whitaker, Executive Associate Director ofiCE Enforcement Removal \nOperations  Matthew T. Albene, Director ofNew York Field Office ofiCE Thomas R. Decker, Deputy Director of \nNew York Field Office ofiCE William P. Joyce, Director of Executive Office for Immigration Review, James \nMcHenry, and Assistant Chieflmmigration Judge Daniel J. Daugherty. \n2 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01336-ALC   Document 102   Filed 06/21/19   Page 3 of 8\nproceedings. The Defendant ICE's New York Field Office contracts with jails in the surrounding \narea to house detained immigrants pending their removal proceedings. \nPrior to June 2018, detained immigrants who had removal proceedings at the Varick \nStreet Immigration Court typically appeared for hearings in person. However, on June 27, 2018, \nthe ICE NY Field Office announced it would stop producing detained immigrants in person and \ninstead, detained immigrants would primarily appear for immigration proceedings through VTC \n(\"VTC policy\"). Initially, the ICE NY Field Office stated this policy change was in response to \nsafety concerns resulting from a multi-day protest from June 21, 2018 to June 25, 2018 outside \nthe Varick Street Immigration Court. However, the ICE NY Field Office later stated it \nimplemented the policy change due to increases in the number of immigration proceedings \noccurring at the Varick Street Immigration Court, cost and logistical challenges. \nThe implementation of the VTC policy has been plagued by numerous technological and \nscheduling challenges including but not limited to: poor connections, technological failures, \nover-scheduling, and a limited number VTC lines. Due to these issues, removal proceedings have \nhad to be adjourned or delayed, often prolonging immigrants' time in detention. Although \nDefendants have acknowledged that there have been technological and scheduling difficulties \nassociated with the adoption of the VTC policy, they maintain that they have taken steps to \naddress these issues. These challenges, however, seem to persist as demonstrated by the fact that \nthe Hudson County Correctional Facility experienced technological failures with its VTC on the \nday of Oral Argument on the motions before this Court. \nIn addition to the technological and scheduling difficulties, Representative Plaintiffs and \nOrganizational Plaintiffs allege the VTC policy has affected Representative Plaintiffs', and \nothers' similarly situated, ability to meaningfully participate in their removal proceedings. In \n3 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01336-ALC   Document 102   Filed 06/21/19   Page 4 of 8\nparticular, they claim the VTC policy prevents detained immigrants from adequately examining \nevidence against them, retaining counsel, communicating confidentially with counsel, and \neffectively utilizing foreign language interpretation services. The Organizational Plaintiffs \nadditionally allege the VTC policy increases the time and cost associated with providing legal \nservices to detained immigrants and their ability to effectively represent their clients. \nLEGAL STANDARD \nI.  Subject Matter Jurisdiction \nThe Court must examine whether it has subject matter jurisdiction as a threshold inquiry \nsince the existence of subject matter jurisdiction invokes the Court's constitutional or statutory \nauthority to adjudicate the claims before it. Sinochem Int'l Co. Ltd. v. Malaysia Int'l Shipping \nCorp., 549 U.S. 422, 431 (2007); Makarova v.  United States, 201 F.3d 110, 113 (2d Cir. 2000). \nChallenges to subject matter jurisdiction may be raised by the parties or by the Court sua \nsponte. Promise! v. First Am. Artificial Flowers, Inc., 943 F.2d 251,254 (2d Cir. 1991). \n\"[I]t is the burden of the party who seeks the exercise of jurisdiction in his favor, clearly \nto allege facts demonstrating that he is a proper party to invoke judicial resolution of the \ndispute.\" Bd. ofE  duc. ofM  t. Sinai Union Free Sch. Dist. v. N. Y State Teachers Ret. Sys., 60 \nF.3d 106, 109 (2d Cir. 1995) (quoting FWIPBS, Inc. v. City ofD  allas, 493 U.S. 215, 231 \n(1990)). \"[W]e must accept as true all material factual allegations in the complaint, but we are \nnot to draw inferences from the complaint favorable to plaintiffs.\" JS. v. Attica Cent. Sch., 386 \nF.3d 107, 110 (2d Cir. 2004). Rather, Plaintiffs must prove subject matter jurisdiction exists by a \npreponderance of the evidence. Makarova, 201 F.3d at 113. \nDISCUSSION \nThe Real ID Act of 2005 provides: \n4 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01336-ALC   Document 102   Filed 06/21/19   Page 5 of 8\n[j]udicial review of all questions of law and fact, including interpretation and application \nof constitutional and statutory provisions, arising from any action taken or proceeding \nbrought to remove an alien from the United States under this subchapter shall be \navailable only in judicial review of a final order under this section \n8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9). The Second Circuit has established a \"substance of the relief' test for \ndetermining whether district courts have jurisdiction over cases involving removal proceedings. \nDelgado v.  Quarantillo, 643 F.3d 52, 55 (2d Cir. 2011). Where immigrants in removal \nproceedings seek to directly or indirectly challenge removal orders or proceedings, the Second \nCircuit and district courts within the circuit have held district courts do not have jurisdiction. I d. \nSee e.g.,  Qiao v. Lynch, 672 F. App'x 134, 135 (2d Cir. 2017) (holding the \"IJ's challenged order \nreopening removal proceedings against Qiao is inextricably linked to the removal proceedings\"); \nSelvaraja v.  US. Dept. ofH  omeland Sec., No. 10 civ. 4580,2010 WL 4861347, *4 (S.D.N.Y. \nNov. 30, 201 0) (holding the district court lacked jurisdiction over Plaintiffs challenges to the \nNotice to Appear because it is \"the necessary first step for initiating the removal process\" and \ntherefore arises from removal proceedings); Vasquez v.  United States, No. 15 CV. 3946, 2015 \nWL 4619805, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 3, 2015) (holding the district court lackedjurisdiction over a \nmotion seeking to stay removal); cf Calderon v. Session, 330 F.Supp.3d 944, 955 (S.D.N.Y. \n20 18) (holding the district court had jurisdiction over the Petitioner's \"right to seek access to a \nlawful regulatory process\"); Michalski v. Decker, 279 F. Supp. 3d 487,494 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) \n(holding the Petitioner's \"challenge to the constitutionality of his arrest and detention is not \nbarred by§ 1252(b)(9)\"); Ruiz v. Mukasey, 552 F.3d 269, 274 (2d Cir. 2009)(holding § \n1252(b )(9) did \"not preclude a district court from exercising jurisdiction over an action seeking \nreview of the denial of an I-13 0 petition because such a denial is unrelated to any removal action \nor proceeding.\"). \n5 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01336-ALC   Document 102   Filed 06/21/19   Page 6 of 8\nHowever, as the Supreme Court's plurality opinion in Jennings v. Rodriguez explained,§ \n1252(b)(9) should not be construed broadly. 138 S. Ct. 830, 840 (2018). Jennings involved a \nhabeas petition challenging the government's prolonged detention of an immigrant in removal \nproceeding without a bond hearing. A plurality of 3 justices concluded that § 1252(b )(9) did not \npresent a jurisdictional bar. In reaching this determination, Justice Ali to explained that \"the \napplicability of§ 1252(b)(9) turns on whether the legal questions ... 'aris[e] from' the actions \ntaken to remove aliens.\" !d. Although \"arising from\" could be construed very broadly, such that \nit encompasses actions that \"would never have occurred if [the immigrant] had not been placed \nin detention,\" this \"expansive interpretation ... would lead to staggering results.\" !d. For \nexample, courts would be stripped of judicial review over claims involving inhumane conditions \nof confinement or state-law assault claims against guards or other detainees, effectively making \nany claims of prolonged detention unreviewable. !d. \nAlthough, in concluding that the Court had jurisdiction, the plurality opinion declined to \ndefine the scope of§ 1252(b)(9), the fact that it contrasted Petitioner's claim with challenges to \n\"review of an order of removal\", \"a decision to detain ... or to seek removal\" or \"any part of the \nprocess by which ... removability will be determined,\" is instructive. !d. at 841. The contrast \nsuggests that federal courts do not have jurisdiction over a claim challenging part of the process \nof removal proceedings. Here, Plaintiffs challenge Defendants' VTC policy. How immigrants \nappear for removal proceedings constitutes part of the process of these proceedings. Therefore, \nthe jurisdictional discussion in Jennings contrasting habeas petitions with process challenges is \nrelevant. \nThe Representative and Organizational Plaintiffs allege that because of Defendants' \nrefusal to produce detained immigrants in person, these immigrants' rights to due process, to \n6 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01336-ALC   Document 102   Filed 06/21/19   Page 7 of 8\naccess the courts, to counsel, and to evidentiary and cross-examination privileges are being \nviolated. Furthermore, Plaintiffs allege the Defendants' refusal to produce detained immigrants \nin the proposed subclass of detained immigrants with disabilities, as defined by the \nRehabilitation Act, is discriminatory. Although this Court is very sympathetic to Plaintiffs' \nclaims, it unfortunately lacks jurisdiction over the present case. Plaintiffs' challenge to \nDefendants' VTC policy arises from \"proceeding[s] brought to remove [undocumented \nimmigrants] from the United States.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9).  In other words, because Plaintiffs \nare challenging, by seeking to enjoin, a \"part of the process by which ... removability will be \ndetermined,\" this court does not have jurisdiction. \nIn addition, it is worth noting that Ragbir v. Homan is not applicable. 923 F.3d 53 (2d \nCir. 20 19). In Ragbir, the Second Circuit addressed whether federal courts have jurisdiction over \na claim where the Appellant sought to enjoin the execution of a valid final order of removal on \nFirst Amendment grounds.Jd. at 57. The Appellant was an outspoken immigration activist, who \nhad publicly criticized ICE.Jd. at 59. He alleged that in enforcing the removal order against him, \nthe Government retaliated against his protected speech and engaged in viewpoint discrimination. \nld at 61. The Second Circuit concluded that 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) stripped federal courts of \njurisdiction over the Appellant's claim. ld. at 63-66. However, because the Appellant did not \nhave \"access to an 'adequate substitute' to the writ (such as a petition for review), or the writ \nitself' the Suspension Clause entitled the Appellant to \"the constitutionally mandated minimum \nscope of the privilege of habeas corpus.\" ld. at 73 (citation omitted). In this case, Plaintiffs \nchallenge Defendants' VTC policy, not their detention. However, even if Plaintiffs had \nchallenged their detention, Ragbir would be inapposite. Unlike the Appellant in Ragbir, \n7 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01336-ALC   Document 102   Filed 06/21/19   Page 8 of 8\nPlaintiffs still have the ability to bring their claims in a BIA proceeding or to file a petition for \nreview. \nCONCLUSION \nFor all of the above-stated reasons, Plaintiffs' motions for a preliminary injunction and \nclass certification are DENIED and Defendants' motion to dismiss is GRANTED. \nSO ORDERED. \n~ 7~a---. \nDated: June 21, 2019 \nNew York, New York  ANDREW L.
