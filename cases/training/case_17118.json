    "summary": "<p>On February 14, 2019, a group of asylum seekers from Central America and several legal organizations filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs sued the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU, the Southern Poverty Law Center, and the Center for Gender &amp; Refugee Studies, sought declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming violations of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs challenged the Trump Administration&rsquo;s new policy of forcing asylum seekers to return to Mexico while they await their removal proceedings: the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP). The plaintiff individual asylum seekers are currently residing in Mexico after having entered the U.S. to request asylum, and then been returned to Mexico under the MPP. The plaintiffs alleged that these asylum seekers are living in fear in Mexico, and that the plaintiff legal organizations are being thwarted from providing representation to such asylum seekers by the physical removal of them from the U.S.</p>\r\n<p>The case was initially assigned to Magistrate Judge Joseph C. Spero, and then reassigned to Judge Richard Seeborg on Feb. 19.</p>\r\n<p>On Feb. 20, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order, seeking to enjoin the MPP until a preliminary injunction could be obtained. The plaintiffs alleged that the MPP violate the section of the INA that purportedly authorizes them, violated the U.S.&rsquo;s duty of non-return, constituted arbitrary and capricious decision making under the APA, and violated the APA&rsquo;s notice and comment requirements. The defendants filed their response on March 1. The judge held a hearing on the motion on March 22. On March 28, 2019, the judge issued an order requesting expedited further briefing on the issue of whether jurisdiction of this case lies exclusively in the District of Columbia.</p>\r\n<p>On April 8, 2019, Judge Seeborg issued an order granting the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. 366 F. Supp. 3d 1110. The judge found that the INA section vesting DHS with the authority in some circumstances to return certain aliens to a contiguous territory (8 USC &sect; 1225(b)(2)(C)) could not be read to apply to the plaintiff asylum seekers or others similarly situated. Additionally, he found that even if that statute could be applied to the plaintiffs, the MPP still need to be enjoined because they fail to sufficiently protect immigrants from being returned to places where their lives or freedom are at risk (in violation of the U.S.'s non-refoulement obligations). Judge Seeborg therefore enjoined the defendants from implementing the MPP nationwide and ordered that the named individual plaintiffs be permitted to enter the U.S.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants appealed the order to the Ninth Circuit and requested a stay of the preliminary injunction pending the appeal. On May 7, 2019, the Ninth Circuit granted a stay of the injunction. 924 F.3d 503. The panel found that the defendants were likely to prevail on the merits of the plaintiffs' INA and APA claims. It stated that the plaintiff asylum seekers were properly subjected to the contiguous-territory provision of the INA, and that the MPP were exempt from the notice-and-comment requirement because they are general statements of policy.</p>\r\n<p>On July 15, 2019, the district court agreed to stay proceedings in the case until the Ninth Circuit appeal was resolved.</p>\r\n<p>On February 28, 2020, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's nationwide injunction of the Migrant Protection Protocols. 951 F.3d 1073. The Court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their INA claims because the INA's contiguous territory return provision does not apply to bona fide asylum seekers, and that the MPP do not comply with the U.S.'s treaty-based non-return obligations codified in the INA. The Court also found that the nationwide scope of the preliminary injunction, which in practical effect would operate in only the four states along the southern border where the MPP are enforced, was warranted.</p>\r\n<p>However, that same day, the government filed an emergency motion requesting either a stay pending disposition of a petition for certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court, or an immediate administrative stay. The Ninth Circuit granted an administrative stay that evening and requested expedited briefing by the parties addressing the government's request for a longer stay.</p>\r\n<p>On March 4, 2020, the Ninth Circuit granted in part and denied in part the requested stay. 951 F.3d 1073. The Ninth Circuit denied the stay with respect to the merits of its February 28 holding that the MPP violate federal law. However, it issued a stay of the injunction insofar as it operates outside the boundaries of the Ninth Circuit; this stay was set to begin on March 12.</p>\r\n<p>On March 11, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an order halting the Ninth Circuit's injunction of the MPP. 140 S.Ct. 1564. Consequently, the MPP remains in effect nationwide.</p>\r\n<p>On April 10, 2020, the government filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court. On October 19, 2020, the Supreme Court granted cert. 140 S.Ct. 1564. However, DHS announced on January 20, 2021, that it would stop enrolling people into MPP, and on June 1, 2021, that it would terminate the program. As such, the asylum procedure became moot and the Ninth Circuit's judgment was vacated on June 21, 2021.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>However, the District Court for the Northern District of Texas issued a nationwide injunction in <a href=\"../../../../case/18186/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Texas et al. v. Biden</a>&nbsp;on August 13, 2021, requiring the Biden administration to restart the MPP program. The Supreme Court declined to stay the injunction, and DHS indicated its intent to appeal a denial to stay the injunction while agreeing to comply with the order in good faith.</p>\r\n<p>On January 14, 2022, the court granted a request to hold the Order to Show Cause, originally issued on August 6, 2021, in abeyance. This hold was renewed on May 16, 2022, allowing the parties more time to continue to confer regarding outstanding issues presented by the case, including whether settlement is possible and how this case should proceed. This Court has not yet addressed the June 30, 2022 Supreme Court decision in <em>Biden v. Texas</em> that held that the government&rsquo;s rescission of MPP did not violate Section 1225 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the then-Secretary of Homeland Security&rsquo;s Oct. 29 memoranda constituted valid final agency action.&nbsp;</p>",

On January 14, 2022, the Court granted a request to hold the Order to Show Cause, originally issued on August 6, 2021, in abeyance. This hold was renewed on May 16, 2022.",

FLETCHER, and PAEZ, Circuit Judges.\nThis court issued its opinion in Innovation Law Lab v. Wolf, No. 19-15716,\non Friday, February 28, 2020, affirming the district court’s injunction against\nimplementation and expansion of the Migrant Protection Protocols (“MPP”).  That\nsame day, the Government filed an emergency motion requesting either a stay\npending disposition of a petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court or an\nimmediate administrative stay.  That evening, we granted an administrative stay,\nalong with an accelerated schedule for briefs addressing the request for a longer-\nlasting stay.  We received a brief from Plaintiffs-Appellants on Monday, March 2;\nwe received a reply brief from the Government on Tuesday, March 3.  For the\nreasons that follow, we grant in part and deny in part the requested stay.  \nWith respect to the merits of our holding that the MPP violates federal law,\nwe deny the requested stay.  With respect to the scope of injunctive relief, we grant\nin part and deny in part the requested stay.\n2\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 109   Filed 03/04/20   Page 3 of 13\nI.  Merits\nThe MPP requires that all asylum seekers arriving at our southern border\nwait in Mexico while their asylum applications are adjudicated.  The MPP clearly\nviolates 8 U.S.C. §§ 1225(b) and 1231(b).\nA.  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)  \nSection 1225(b) divides aliens applying for asylum into two categories: \n“[A]pplicants for admission fall into one of two categories, those covered by §\n1225(b)(1) and those covered by § 1225(b)(2).”  Jennings v. Rodriguez, 138 S. Ct.\n830, 837 (2018). \nSection (b)(1) applicants are those who have no documents or fraudulent\ndocuments.  In fleeing persecution in their home countries, typical bona fide\nasylum seekers have either fraudulent documents or no documents at all.  \nSection (b)(2) applicants are “all other” applicants.  Section (b)(2) applicants\ninclude spies, terrorists, alien smugglers, and drug traffickers.  \nSection 1225 specifies different procedures for the two categories of\napplicants.  Section (b)(1) applicants who have expressed a “credible fear” of\npersecution have a right to remain in the United States while their applications are\nadjudicated.  Section (b)(2) applicants do not have that right.  Subsection (b)(2)(C)\nspecifically authorizes the Attorney General to require § (b)(2) applicants to wait in\n3\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 109   Filed 03/04/20   Page 4 of 13\nMexico while their asylum applications are adjudicated.  There is no subsection in\n§ (b)(1) comparable to subsection (b)(2)(C).  \nIt is easy to understand why § (b)(1) and § (b)(2) applicants are treated\ndifferently.  Section (b)(1) applicants pose little threat to the security of the United\nStates.  By contrast, § (b)(2) applicants potentially pose a severe threat. \nThe MPP applies subsection (b)(2)(C) to § (b)(1) applicants.  There is no\nlegal basis for doing so.  \nB.  8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)\nSection 1231(b), previously codified as § 1253(h), was enacted in 1980 to\nimplement our treaty-based obligation to avoid “refoulement” of refugees. \nRefoulement is the act of sending refugees back to the dangerous countries from\nwhich they have come.  Section 1231(b) provides, “[T]he Attorney General may\nnot remove an alien to a country if the Attorney General decides that the alien’s\nlife or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien’s race,\nreligion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.”\nUnder the MPP, an asylum officer screening asylum seekers is not allowed\nto ask whether they fear that their “life or freedom would be threatened” upon\nbeing returned to Mexico.  The MPP requires asylum seekers—untutored in\nasylum law—to volunteer that they fear being returned to Mexico, even though\n4\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 109   Filed 03/04/20   Page 5 of 13\nthey are not told that the existence of such fear could protect them from being\nreturned.\nUncontradicted evidence in the record shows not only that asylum officers\nimplementing the MPP do not ask whether asylum seekers fear returning to\nMexico.  It also shows that officers actively prevent or discourage applicants from\nexpressing such a fear, and that they ignore applicants who succeed in doing so. \nFor example, Alex Doe, a plaintiff in this case, wrote in a sworn declaration,\n“When I tried to respond and explain [why I had left Honduras] the officer told me\nsomething like, ‘you are only going to respond to the questions I ask you, nothing\nmore.’”  Frank Doe, another plaintiff, wrote in a sworn declaration, “He never\nasked me if I was afraid of returning to Mexico.  At one point, I had to interrupt\nhim to explain that I didn’t feel safe in Mexico.  He told me that it was too bad.  He\nsaid that Honduras wasn’t safe, Mexico wasn’t safe, and the U.S. isn’t safe either.” \nUncontradicted evidence also shows that there is extreme danger to asylum\nseekers who are returned to Mexico.  For example, Howard Doe, a plaintiff, wrote\nin a sworn declaration:  “While I was in Tijuana, two young Honduran men were\nabducted, tortured and killed.  . . .  On Wednesday, January 30, 2019, I was\nattacked and robbed by two young Mexican men.  . . .  They . . . told me that they\nknew I was Honduran and that if they saw me again, they would kill me.”  Ian Doe,\n5\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 109   Filed 03/04/20   Page 6 of 13\nanother plaintiff, wrote in a sworn declaration, “I am not safe in Mexico.  I am\nafraid that the people who want to harm me in Honduras will find me here.” \nDennis Doe, another plaintiff, had fled the gang “MS-13” in Honduras.  He wrote\nin a sworn declaration, “In Tijuana, I have seen people who I believe are MS-13\ngang members on the street and on the beach.  . . .   I know that MS-13 were\nsearching for people who tried to escape them . . . .  This makes me afraid that the\npeople who were trying to kill me in Honduras will find me here.”  Kevin Doe,\nanother plaintiff, had fled MS-13 in Honduras because of his work as an\nEvangelical Christian minister.  He wrote in a sworn declaration, “[When I was\nreturned to Mexico from the United States], I was met by a large group of reporters\nwith cameras.  . . .  I was afraid that the MS-13 might see my face in the news.  . . . \nThey are a powerful, ruthless gang and have members in Tijuana too.”\nIt is clear from the text of the MPP, as well as from extensive and\nuncontradicted evidence in the record, that the MPP violates the anti-refoulement\nobligation embodied in § 1231(b).  \nC.  Stay with Respect to the Merits\nTwo of the three judges on our panel, Judges W. Fletcher and Paez, held that\nthe MPP clearly violates both §§ 1225(b) and 1231(b).  The third judge, Judge\nFernandez, did not independently reach the question whether the MPP violates\n6\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 109   Filed 03/04/20   Page 7 of 13\nthose sections.  Judge Fernandez dissented from the panel’s decision based on a\npoint of appellate procedure.\nBecause the MPP so clearly violates §§ 1225(b) and 1231(b), and because\nthe harm the MPP causes to plaintiffs is so severe, we decline to stay our opinion\npending certiorari proceedings in the Supreme Court, except as noted below with\nrespect to the scope of the injunction.  \nII.  Scope of the Injunction\nThe district court enjoined the Government from continuing to implement or\nexpand the MPP, and required the Government to allow the named individual\nplaintiffs to enter the United States to pursue their applications for asylum.  The\ninjunction provides as follows:\nDefendants are hereby enjoined and restrained from continuing to\nimplement or expand the “Migrant Protection Protocols” as announced\nin the January 25, 2018 DHS policy memorandum and as explicated in\nfurther agency memoranda.  Within 2 days of the effective date of this\norder, defendants shall permit the named individual plaintiffs to enter the\nUnited States.  At defendants’ option, any named plaintiff appearing at\nthe border for admission pursuant to this order may be detained or\nparoled, pending adjudication of his or her admission application.\nInnovation Law Lab v. Nielsen, 366 F. Supp. 3d 1110, 1130–31 (N.D. Cal. 2019). \nWhen suit was filed in the district court, the MPP had been applied only at the\ndesignated port of entry at San Ysidro, California.  There are eleven named\nindividual plaintiffs.  \n7\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 109   Filed 03/04/20   Page 8 of 13\nBecause the district court’s order was stayed pending appeal, the\nGovernment expanded the scope of the MPP.  The MPP is now in effect in the four\nstates along our southern border with Mexico.  Two of those states, California and\nArizona, are in the Ninth Circuit.  New Mexico is in the Tenth Circuit.  Texas is in\nthe Fifth Circuit.  \nFor the reasons explained in our opinion, Ninth Circuit case law requires that\nwe affirm the scope of the district court’s injunction.  Plaintiffs challenge the MPP\nas inconsistent with § 706(2) of the Administrative Procedure Act, which directs a\nreviewing court that has found an agency action “unlawful” to “set aside” that\naction.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  Section 706(2) does not tell a reviewing circuit court to\n“set aside” the unlawful agency action only within the geographic boundaries of\nthat circuit.  Further, there is a special need for uniformity in immigration cases, as\nrecognized both by our court and by the Fifth Circuit.  See Regents of the Univ. of\nCal. v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 908 F. 3d 476, 511 (9th Cir. 2018); Texas v.\nUnited States, 809 F.3d 134, 187–88 (5th Cir. 2015), aff’d by an equally divided\nCourt, 136 S. Ct. 2271 (2016) \nHowever, we recognize that the proper scope of injunctions against agency\naction is a matter of intense and active controversy.  Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v.\nNew York, 140 S. Ct. 599, 600–01 (2020) (Gorsuch, J., concurring); Trump v.\n8\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 109   Filed 03/04/20   Page 9 of 13\nHawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392, 2424–29 (2018) (Thomas, J., concurring); see also Wolf\nv. Cook Cty., Ill., 140 S. Ct. 681, 681–82 (2020) (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). \nWhile we regard the merits of our decision under §§ 1225(b) and 1231(b) as\nclearly correct, we do not have the same level of confidence with respect to the\nscope of the injunction entered by the district court.  We therefore stay the\ninjunction insofar as it operates outside the geographical boundaries of the Ninth\nCircuit.\nIII.  Declarations Filed in Connection with the Government’s\nMotion to Stay Pending Disposition of a Petition for Certiorari\nThe Government’s motion for stay and reply brief include several sworn\ndeclarations.   The United States Ambassador to Mexico writes, “The panel’s\ndecision, unless stayed, will have an immediate and severely prejudicial impact on\nthe bilateral relationship between the United States and Mexico.”  The Assistant\nSecretary for International Affairs for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\nwrites, “MPP was a carefully negotiated solution with the Government of Mexico.” \nShe writes further, “The suspension of MPP undermines almost two years’ worth\nof diplomatic engagement with the Government of Mexico through which a\ncoordinated and cohesive immigration control program has been developed.”   The\nDeputy Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection writes that\nenforcement of the district court’s injunction will cause substantial disruption at\n9\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 109   Filed 03/04/20   Page 10 of 13\nour ports of entry and will cost substantial amounts of money.  He writes further\nthat on Friday, the day our decision was announced, large groups of aliens sought\nadmission to the United States at various points along the border.  The Executive\nAssociate Director of Enforcement and Removal Operations for U.S. Immigration\nand Customs Enforcement writes, “[I]f MPP is discontinued, approximately 25,000\nindividuals enrolled in MPP who remain in Mexico may soon arrive in the United\nStates seeking admission.  . . .  [I]f [Customs and Border Protection] is required to\nprocess approximately 25,000 inadmissible aliens in an extremely short timeframe\nand then transfer those aliens to [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] custody,\nit would overload [Enforcement and Removal Operations’] already burdened\nresources and create significant adverse implications for public safety and the\nintegrity of the United States immigration system.” \nThe Plaintiffs-Appellants’ brief responding to the Government’s motion\nincludes two sworn declarations.  Mexico’s Ambassador to the United States from\n2007 to 2013 writes, “The government of Mexico has consistently stated that MPP\nis a policy unilaterally imposed by the U.S. government.  To the extent Mexico\nagreed to the policy, it was upon threat of heavy and unprecedented tariffs.”  He\nwrites, further, “I reject the notion that this Court’s determination that MPP is\nlikely unlawful will harm our two nations’ relationship.  Rather, it is MPP\n10\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 109   Filed 03/04/20   Page 11 of 13\nitself—and the way the current administration is conducting policy towards\nMexico—that is particularly detrimental to the bilateral relationship between the\nUnited States and Mexico.”  An expert on border and immigration issues writes\nthat it is the MPP that has created chaos at our southern border, and that the MPP\nhas not had a significant effect in reducing the flow of immigrants into the United\nStates.  \nWe are not in a position to assess the accuracy of these statements.  \nConclusion\nIf the law were less clear—that is, if there were any serious possibility that\nthe MPP is consistent with §§ 1225(b) and 1231(b)—we would stay the district\ncourt’s injunction in its entirety pending disposition of the Government’s petition\nfor certiorari.  However, it is very clear that the MPP violates §§ 1225(b) and\n1231(b), and it is equally clear that the MPP is causing extreme and irreversible\nharm to plaintiffs.\nWe stay, pending disposition of the Government’s petition for certiorari, the\ndistrict court’s injunction insofar as it operates outside the Ninth Circuit.  We\ndecline to stay, pending disposition of the Government’s petition for certiorari, the\ndistrict court’s injunction against the MPP insofar as it operates within the Ninth\nCircuit.\n11\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 109   Filed 03/04/20   Page 12 of 13\nThe Government has requested in its March 3 reply brief, in the event we\ndeny any part of their request for a stay, that we “extend the [administrative] stay\nby at least seven days, to March 10, to afford the Supreme Court an orderly\nopportunity for review.”  We grant the Government’s request and extend our\nadministrative stay entered on Friday, February 28, until Wednesday, March 11.  If\nthe Supreme Court has not in the meantime acted to reverse or otherwise modify\nour decision, our partial grant and partial denial of the Government’s request for a\nstay of the district court’s injunction, as described above, will take effect on\nThursday, March 12.\nSo ordered on March 4, 2020.  \n12\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 109   Filed 03/04/20   Page 13 of 13\nFILED\nInnovation Law Lab v.

INTRODUCTION  \nSd rn \nee 17    In January of this year, the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) began \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  implementing a new policy regarding non-Mexican asylum seekers arriving in the United States \n19  from Mexico.1 Denominated the “Migrant Protection Protocols” (“MPP”), the policy calls for such \n20  persons, with certain exceptions, to be “returned to Mexico for the duration of their immigration \n21  proceedings,” rather than either being detained for expedited or regular removal proceedings, or \n22  issued notices to appear for regular removal proceedings. This case presents two basic questions: \n23  (1) does the Immigration and Nationalization Act authorize DHS to carry out the return policy of \n24 \n                                                 \n25  1 The policy is administered by DHS sub-agencies Citizenship and Immigration Services (“CIS”), \nCustoms and Border Protection (“CBP”), and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”)).  \n26 \nThe defendants named in this action are those agencies, and certain of their officials (collectively \n“DHS” or “the Government”). \n27 \n \n28 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 73   Filed 04/08/19   Page 2 of 27\n \n1  the MPP, and; (2) even assuming Congress has authorized such returns in general, does the MPP \n2  include sufficient safeguards to comply with DHS’s admitted legal obligation not to return any \n3  alien to a territory where his or her “life or freedom would be threatened”? In support of their \n4  motion for a preliminary injunction, the plaintiffs have sufficiently shown the answer to both \n5  questions is “no.”   \n6    First, the statute that vests DHS with authority in some circumstances to return certain \n7  aliens to a “contiguous territory” cannot be read to apply to the individual plaintiffs or others \n8  similarly situated. Second, even assuming the statute could or should be applied to the individual \n9  plaintiffs, they have met their burden to enjoin the MPP on grounds that it lacks sufficient \n10  protections against aliens being returned to places where they face undue risk to their lives or \n11  freedom. Accordingly, plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction will be granted.2 \n12    To be clear, the issue in this case is not whether it would be permissible for Congress to \n a\n rtni\nouor 13  authorize DHS to return aliens to Mexico pending final determinations as to their admissibility.  \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  Nor does anything in this decision imply that DHS would be unable to exercise any such authority \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  in a legal manner should it provide adequate safeguards. Likewise, the legal question is not \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  whether the MPP is a wise, intelligent, or humane policy, or whether it is the best approach for \nd Srn \nee 17  addressing the circumstances the executive branch contends constitute a crisis. Policy decisions \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  remain for the political branches of government to make, implement, and enforce.  \n19    Rather, this injunction turns on the narrow issue of whether the MPP complies with the \n20  Administrative Procedures Act (“APA”). The conclusion of this order is only that plaintiffs are \n21  likely to show it does not, because the statute DHS contends the MPP is designed to enforce does \n22  not apply to these circumstances, and even if it did, further procedural protections would be \n23  required to conform to the government’s acknowledged obligation to ensure aliens are not \n24  returned to unduly dangerous circumstances. \n25                                                   \n2 Plaintiffs’ motion was filed as an application for a temporary restraining order. In response to a \n26 \ncourt scheduling order, the parties stipulated to deem plaintiffs’ motion as one for a preliminary \ninjunction, which now has been fully briefed and heard.  \n27 \n28   \nCASE NO.  19-cv-00807-RS \n2 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 73   Filed 04/08/19   Page 3 of 27\n \n1    Furthermore, nothing in this order obligates the government to release into the United \n2  States any alien who has not been legally admitted, pursuant to a fully-adjudicated asylum \n3  application or on some other basis. DHS retains full statutory authority to detain all aliens pending \n4  completion of either expedited or regular removal proceedings. See Jennings v. Rodriguez, 138 S. \n5  Ct. 830 (2018).   \n6   \n7  II.  BACKGROUND   \n8    In December of 2018, the Secretary of the DHS, Kirstjen Nielsen, announced adoption of \n9  the MPP, which she described as a “historic action to confront illegal immigration.” See December \n10  20, 2018 press release, “Secretary Kirstjen M. Nielsen Announces Historic Action to Confront \n11  Illegal Immigration,” Administrative Record (“AR”) 16-18. DHS explained that pursuant to the \n12  MPP, “the United States will begin the process of invoking Section 235(b)(2)(C) of the \n a\n rtni\nouor 13  Immigration and Nationality Act.” Id.  DHS asserted that under the claimed statutory authority, \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  “individuals arriving in or entering the United States from Mexico—illegally or without proper \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  documentation—may be returned to Mexico for the duration of their immigration proceedings.”  \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  Id. \nd Srn \nee 17    In January of 2019, DHS issued a further press release regarding the implementation of the \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  MPP. See “Migrant Protection Protocols,” AR 11-15. In a paragraph entitled “What Gives DHS \n19  the Authority to Implement MPP?” the press release asserts: \n \n20 \nSection 235 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) addresses \nthe inspection of aliens seeking to be admitted into the U.S. and \n21 \nprovides specific procedures regarding the treatment of those not \nclearly entitled to admission, including those who apply for asylum.  \n22 \nSection 235(b)(2)(C) provides that “in the case of an alien  . . . who \n23  is arriving on land (whether or not at a designated port of arrival) \nfrom a foreign territory contiguous to the U.S.,” the Secretary of \n24 \nHomeland Security “may return the alien to that territory pending a \n[removal] proceeding under § 240” of the INA. \n25 \n26 \n  The positions taken in press releases reflect contemporaneous policy memoranda. On \n27 \nJanuary 25, 2018, Secretary Nielsen issued a memorandum stating: \n28   \nCASE NO.  19-cv-00807-RS \n3 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 73   Filed 04/08/19   Page 4 of 27\n \n \n1 \n[T]he United States will begin the process of implementing Section \n235(b)(2)(C) . . . with respect to non-Mexican nationals who may be \n2 \narriving on land (whether or not at a designated port of entry) \nseeking to enter the United States from Mexico illegally or without \n3 \nproper documentation.  \n4 \nDHS Memorandum, AR 7-10; see also CIS Policy Memorandum, January 28, 2019, “Guidance \n5 \nfor Implementing Section 235(b)(2)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Migrant \n6 \nProtection Protocols. AR 2271-2275. \n7 \n  Thus, it is undisputed that the MPP represents a legal exercise of defendants’ authority \n8 \nregarding treatment of alien applicants for admission if and only if section 235(b)(2)(C) of the \n9 \nImmigration and Nationality Act applies to the individual plaintiffs and those similarly situated. \n10 \nSection 235(b)(2)(C) is codified at 8 U.S.C. §1225(b)(2)(C) and will hereafter be referred to as the \n11 \n“contiguous territory return provision.” \n12 \n a\n rtni\nouor 13    It is similarly undisputed that prior to adoption of the MPP, aliens applying for asylum at a \nCif\nct Cal 14  port of entry on the U.S.-Mexico border were either placed in expedited removal proceedings \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  pursuant subparagraph (1) of 8 U.S.C. §1225(b), or in defendants’ discretion were placed in \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  regular removal proceedings described in 8 U.S.C. §1229a. There also is no apparent dispute that \nd Srn  aliens placed directly into regular removal proceedings frequently were permitted to remain in the \nee 17 \nth\nnirt\nUo United States during the pendency of those proceedings, and were not detained in custody.  In \nN 18 \nannouncing the MPP, Secretary Nielsen asserted the new policy is intended to address a purported \n19 \nproblem of aliens “trying to game the system” by making groundless asylum claims and then \n20 \n“disappear[ing] into the United States, where many skip their court dates.” See December 20, 2018 \n21 \npress release, AR 16. \n22 \n  Although the contiguous territory return provision has existed in the statute for many \n23 \nyears, the extent to which it has previously been utilized is unclear in the present record. While the \n24 \nprovision theoretically could be applied with respect to aliens arriving from either Mexico or \n25 \nCanada, the focus of the MPP is aliens transiting through Mexico, who originated from other \n26 \ncountries. When this suit was filed, the MPP had been implemented only at the San Ysidro port of \n27 \n28   \nCASE NO.  19-cv-00807-RS \n4 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 73   Filed 04/08/19   Page 5 of 27\n \n1  entry on the California-Mexico border. Defendants have since advised that it has now been \n2  extended to the Calexico port of entry, also on the California-Mexico border, and to El Paso, \n3  Texas. Indications are that it will be further extended unless enjoined. \n4    The CIS Policy Memorandum providing guidance for implementing the MPP specifically \n5  addresses the issue of aliens who might face persecution if returned to Mexico. Under that \n6  guidance, aliens who, unprompted, express a fear of return to Mexico during processing will be \n7  referred to an asylum officer for interview. CIS Policy Memorandum, AR 2273. The asylum \n8  officer’s determination, however, is not reviewable by an immigration judge. Id at 2274. Although \n9  DHS insists this policy satisfies all obligations the United States has under domestic and \n10  international law to avoid “refoulement”— the forcible return of prospective asylum seekers to \n11  places where they may be persecuted—there is no dispute that the procedural protections are less \n12  robust than those available in expedited removal proceedings, or those that apply when a decision \n a\n rtni\nouor 13  is made that an alien is subject to removal at the conclusion of regular removal proceedings.  \nCif\nt al\ncC 14    Plaintiffs in this action are eleven individuals who were “returned” to Mexico under the \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  MPP, and six non-profit organizations that provide legal services and advocacy related to \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  immigration issues.3 Plaintiffs’ claims in this action are brought under the Administrative \nd Srn \nee 17  Procedures Act and international law, although the preliminary injunction is sought only under the \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  former. \n19   \n20  III. LEGAL STANDARD \n21  A. Injunctions \n22  An application for preliminary injunctive relief requires the plaintiff to “establish that he is \n23  likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \n24  preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the \n25 \n                                                 \n26 \n3  The unopposed motion of the individual plaintiffs to proceed in this litigation under pseudonyms \n(Dkt.

N.R.D.C., Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 21-22 (2008).  The Ninth Circuit has \n2  clarified, however, that courts in this Circuit should still evaluate the likelihood of success on a \n3  “sliding scale.”  Alliance for Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1134 (9th Cir. 2011) (“[T]he \n4  ‘serious questions’ version of the sliding scale test for preliminary injunctions remains viable after \n5  the Supreme Court’s decision in Winter.”).  As quoted in Cottrell, that test provides that, “[a] \n6  preliminary injunction is appropriate when a plaintiff demonstrates . . . that serious questions \n7  going to the merits were raised and the balance of hardships tips sharply in the plaintiff’s favor,” \n8  provided, of course, that “plaintiffs must also satisfy the other [Winter] factors” including the \n9  likelihood of irreparable harm.  Id. at 1135. \n10   \n11  B. The APA \n12  Under section 706 of the APA, a reviewing court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency \n a\n rtni\nouor 13  action, findings, and conclusions found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  otherwise not in accordance with law; contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  immunity; in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right; \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  [or] without observance of procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(D). Accordingly, \nd Srn \nee 17  the decision-making process that ultimately leads to the agency action must be “logical and \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  rational.” Allentown Mack Sales & Serv., Inc. v. NLRB, 522 U.S. 359, 374 (1998). Courts should \n19  be careful, however, not to substitute their own judgment for that of the agency. Suffolk Cty. v. \n20  Sec’y of Interior, 562 F.2d 1368, 1383 (2d Cir. 1977). Ultimately, a reviewing court may uphold \n21  agency action “only on the grounds that the agency invoked when it took the action.” Michigan v. \n22  EPA, 135 S. Ct. 2699, 2710 (2015). Post hoc rationalizations may not be considered. American \n23  Textile Mfrs. Inst., Inc. v. Donovan, 452 U.S. 490, 539 (1981). In evaluating APA claims, courts \n24  typically limit their review to the Administrative Record existing at the time of the decision. Sw. \n25  Ctr. for Biological Diversity v.

DISCUSSION \n4    A.  Justiciability \n5    At the threshold, defendants oppose plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary relief by arguing \n6  their claims simply are not justiciable. Defendants advance several interrelated points. First, \n7  defendants contend the central issue is fundamentally one of prosecutorial discretion, and \n8  therefore immune from judicial review. Were plaintiffs in fact challenging a policy decision to \n9  place them in regular removal proceedings as opposed to expedited removal proceedings, that \n10  argument might be viable.   \n11    As discussed below, however, plaintiffs concede DHS has such discretion, and none of \n12  their claims in this action rest on a contrary position. Rather, the complaint here alleges the statute \n a\n rtni\nouor 13  on which defendants rely simply does not confer on DHS the powers it claims to be exercising \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  under the MPP. While defendants are free to argue they have discretion under the statute to adopt \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  and enforce the MPP, whether or not they actually do is a justiciable question. \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16    Next, defendants contend several different sections of the INA preclude judicial review. \nd Srn \nee 17  Defendants first cite 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g), which provides that “[e]xcept as provided in this section . \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  . . no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien arising \n19  from the decision or action by the [Secretary] to commence proceedings.” Defendants argue that \n20  provision is “designed to give some measure of protection to . . . discretionary determinations” \n21                                                   \n4 Here, plaintiffs submit substantial evidence outside the administrative record, which \n22 \ndefendants move to strike and which plaintiffs move separately to deem admitted. The parties \n23  agree extra-record evidence is admissible for limited purposes, including to support standing or a \nshowing of irreparable harm.  Plaintiffs stipulate to having the present motion adjudicated based \n24  on the administrative record presented by defendants, without waiving their right to challenge the \ncompleteness of that record at a later junction. This order relies only on matters in the \n25 \nadministrative record or which the parties otherwise agree may be considered. Further rulings on \nspecific aspects of the motions to strike and to admit accordingly need not be addressed at this \n26 \njuncture. \n27   \n28   \nCASE NO.  19-cv-00807-RS \n7 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 73   Filed 04/08/19   Page 8 of 27\n \n1  like “the initiation or prosecution of various stages in the deportation process,” and so bars claims \n2  “attempt[ing] to impose judicial constraints upon prosecutorial discretion.” Reno v. Am.-Arab \n3  Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 485 n.9 (1999). This argument, however, turns on the \n4  conclusion that if DHS has discretion to apply the contiguous return provision to persons in the \n5  circumstances of the individual plaintiffs, its decisions to return or not return any particular alien \n6  under any such authority, might not be subject to review. \n7    Defendants next invoke 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a), which provides, in part, “[n]otwithstanding \n8  any other provision of law,” “no court shall have jurisdiction to review . . . any other decision or \n9  action of the . . . Secretary of Homeland Security the authority for which is specified under this \n10  subchapter to be in the discretion of the . . . Secretary.” As defendants admit, however, this \n11  provision applies when the relevant decision is “specified by statute to be in the discretion of the” \n12  the Secretary. Kucana v. Holder, 558 U.S. 233, 248 (2010). The very point of dispute in this \n a\n rtni\nouor 13  action is whether section 1225(b)(2)(C) applies such that DHS has such discretion, or not. That \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  threshold question is justiciable.   \ni\nstrof \nDict  15    Defendants further argue 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a) and (e) jointly preclude review. As noted, \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  §1252(a) does not foreclose examination of whether application of the contiguous territory return \nd Srn \nee 17  provision to the named plaintiffs is legally correct. Defendants also assert section 1252(a)(2)(A) \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  provides that no court shall have jurisdiction, except as permitted in section 1252(e), to review \n19  “procedures and policies adopted by the [Secretary] to implement the provisions of section \n20  1225(b)(1).” To the extent that is a new argument, it fails because plaintiffs in this action are not \n21  challenging the discretionary decision to refrain from placing them in expedited removal under \n22  1225(b)(1), and are instead litigating what the consequences of placing them in section 1229a \n23  proceedings should or should not be. \n24    The final issue is the potential applicability of section 1252(e)(3). That subparagraph \n25  provides no court, other than the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, has \n26  jurisdiction to review “determinations under section 1225(b) of this title and its implementation,” \n27  including “whether such a . . . written policy directive, written policy guideline, or written \n28   \nCASE NO.  19-cv-00807-RS \n8 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 73   Filed 04/08/19   Page 9 of 27\n \n1  procedure issued by or under the authority of the [Secretary] to implement such section, is not \n2  consistent with applicable provisions of this subchapter or is otherwise in violation of law.” 8 \n3  U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(A). On its face, this provision arguably requires plaintiffs’ claims to proceed \n4  exclusively in the District of Columbia. In light of that concern, the parties were invited to provide \n5  further briefing after the hearing on the motion for preliminary relief. See Dkt. No. 68. \n6    Plaintiffs argue section 1252(e)(3) is intended only to invest jurisdiction in the district \n7  court of the District of Columbia to hear systemic challenges specifically addressing the expedited \n8  removal scheme. Thus, plaintiffs argue, the provision’s reference to “determinations under section \n9  1225(b) of this title and its implementation,” rather than “determinations under section \n10  1225(b)(1)” should be seen as nothing more than a “scrivener’s error.” \n11    The question is close, because section 1252(e)(3) otherwise would appear to describe the \n12  issues presented in this case quite well. As noted, it expressly refers to review of issues such as, \n a\n rtni\nouor 13  “whether such a regulation, or a written policy directive, written policy guideline, or written \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  procedure issued by or under the authority of the Attorney General to implement such section, is \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  not consistent with applicable provisions of this subchapter or is otherwise in violation of law.” \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  That lines up neatly with the main thrust of plaintiffs’ argument here—that contrary to defendants’ \nd Srn \nee 17  claim the MPP merely addresses when discretion should be exercised to apply the contiguous \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  territory return provision, by definition the provision in fact does not apply to plaintiffs.   \n19    Nevertheless, plaintiffs have the better argument that section 1252(e)(3) should not be read \n20  to require them to bring these claims in the District of Columbia. Although statutory titles and \n21  headings are not dispositive, they are instructive. See Fla. Dep’t of Revenue v. Piccadilly \n22  Cafeterias, Inc., 554 U.S. 33, 47, 128 S. Ct. 2326 (2008) (“To be sure, a subchapter heading \n23  cannot substitute for the operative text of the statute . . . [T]he title of a statute  . . . cannot limit the \n24  plain meaning of the text. Nonetheless, statutory titles and section headings are tools available for \n25  the resolution of a doubt about the meaning of a statute.”)(internal quotations and citations \n26  omitted).  \n27    Here, section 1252 as a whole is entitled, “Judicial review of orders of removal,” and most \n28   \nCASE NO.  19-cv-00807-RS \n9 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 73   Filed 04/08/19   Page 10 of 27\n \n1  of its provisions are focused on issues relating to review of individual decisions to remove an \n2  alien. More to the point in question here, subparagraph (e) is entitled “Judicial review of orders \n3  under section 1225(b)(1)” (emphasis added). Other sub-subparagraphs of (e) explicitly indicate \n4  that they are applicable to challenges to determinations made under 1225(b)(1). See \n5  §1252(e)(1)(A) (“ . . . in accordance with section 1225(b)(1) . . .); §1252(e)(2) (“any determination \n6  made under section 1225(b)(1) . . . .”); §1252(e)(4)(A) (“. . . an alien who was not ordered \n7  removed under section 1225(b)(1) of this title”); §1252(e)(5) (“. . . an alien has been ordered \n8  removed under section 1225(b)(1) of this title”). \n9    Given that sub-subparagraphs (1), (2), (4), and (5) of 8 U.S.C §1252(e) all expressly \n10  invoke section 1225(b)(1), the mere fact that §1252(e)(3) fails to state “1225(b)(1)” instead of \n11  only “1225(b)” is too thin a reed on which to conclude that jurisdiction of this action lies \n12  exclusively in the federal court of the District of Columbia. The omission of “(1)” may or may not \n a\n rtni\nouor 13  constitute a “scrivener’s error,” in the traditional sense of that phrase, but it is not a basis to \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  disregard the clear import of the structure of section 1252 and subparagraph (e).  \ni\nstrof \nDict  15    Challenges to “validity of the system” undeniably are subject to section 1252(e)(3), and \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  therefore arguably subject to exclusive jurisdiction in the District of Columbia.5 In context, \nd Srn \nee 17  however, “the system” should be understood as a reference to the expedited removal procedure \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  authorized under section 1225(b)(1). There can be no dispute that this action is not a challenge to \n19  that “system.” Rather, plaintiffs acknowledge both that they are subject to expedited removal and \n20  that DHS has discretion to place them instead into regular removal proceedings under 8 U.S.C. \n21  §1229a. Indeed, in essence, plaintiffs are arguing that because they are subject to expedited \n22  removal, they should at a minimum have the protections they would enjoy under that regime, \n23  either by being exempt from contiguous territorial return, and/or by having additional procedural \n24  and substantive protections against being sent to places in which they would not be safe from \n25                                                   \n5 Plaintiffs contend that even where section 1252(e)(3) applies and permits jurisdiction in the \n26 \nDistrict of Columbia, it does not preclude jurisdiction elsewhere. While that proposition appears \ndubious at best, the question need not be decided here. \n27 \n28   \nCASE NO.  19-cv-00807-RS \n10 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 73   Filed 04/08/19   Page 11 of 27\n \n1  persecution.   \n2    Accordingly, this action is not a challenge to the “system” of expedited removal. Given the \n3  overall structure of section 1252(e), the most reasonable construction of subparagraph (3) is that it \n4  applies only to such challenges. See Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 528, 122 S.Ct. 983 (2002). \n5  (“The placement of §1146(a) within a subchapter expressly limited to postconfirmation matters \n6  undermines Piccadilly’s view that §1146(a) covers preconfirmation transfers.”). As a result, \n7  whether presented as a jurisdictional issue or one of venue, 8 U.S.C. §1252(e)(3) is not a bar to the \n8  particular claims plaintiffs present in this forum.6 \n9   \n10    B.  Standing \n11     In a footnote, defendants assert “[t]he organizational Plaintiffs lack standing because they \n12  lack a ‘judicially cognizable interest in the prosecution or nonprosecution of another.’” Opposition \n a\n rtni\nouor 13  at 10, n. 5. (quoting Linda R.S. v. Richard D., 410 U.S. 614, 619 (1973)). Defendants concede, \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  however, that their standing arguments are foreclosed by the holding in East Bay Sanctuary \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  Covenant v. Trump, 909 F.3d 1219, 1240 (9th Cir. 2018), where the Ninth Circuit held that \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  similarly situated organizational plaintiffs have organizational standing premised on a diversion of \nd Srn \nee 17  resources caused by the challenged government actions. See id. at 1242.  \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18    Defendants state they “respectfully disagree with that ruling” and question standing only to \n19  preserve their rights on appeal. Nevertheless, to the extent defendants argue East Bay Sanctuary is \n20  factually distinguishable, their position is not persuasive. It is true, as defendants point out, that \n21  East Bay involved a different statutory provision, and that standing may turn on whether a plaintiff \n22 \n                                                 \n23 \n6  Defendants also seek a discretionary transfer under 28 U.S.C. §1404 to the Southern District of \n24  California. Although the MPP was first implemented at a border crossing point in that district, \ndefendants have not shown that the balance of factors applicable under §1404 warrant a transfer.  \n25 \nPlaintiffs’ choice of forum is supported by the institutional plaintiffs’ presence in this district and \nis therefore entitled to deference. The issues in the litigation largely involve legal questions not \n26 \ntied to any district and/or federal policy decisions not made in or limited to the Southern District \nof California. The motion to transfer is therefore denied. \n27 \n28   \nCASE NO.  19-cv-00807-RS \n11 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 73   Filed 04/08/19   Page 12 of 27\n \n1  is “arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute . . . in \n2  question.” Clarke v. Sec. Indus. Ass’n., 479 U.S. 388, 396 (1987).  Nevertheless, the \n3  organizational plaintiffs have made a showing that is stronger, if anything, than that in East Bay \n4  Sanctuary. Plaintiffs’ organizational standing in that case was premised on various broad \n5  “diversion of resources” arguments and the potential loss of funding. See, e.g., 909 F.3d at 1242 \n6  (“The Organizations have also offered uncontradicted evidence that enforcement of the Rule has \n7  required, and will continue to require, a diversion of resources, independent of expenses for this \n8  litigation, from their other initiatives.”)  Here, the organizational plaintiffs have made a showing \n9  that the challenged policy directly impedes their mission, in that it is manifestly more difficult to \n10  represent clients who are returned to Mexico, as opposed to being held or released into the United \n11  States. Additionally, there is no suggestion by defendants that the individual plaintiffs lack \n12  standing.  Accordingly, to whatever extent defendants may have challenged standing, there is no \n a\n rtni\nouor 13  basis to preclude preliminary relief on such grounds.7 \nCif\nt al\ncC 14   \ni\nstrof \nDict  15    C.  Showing on the merits \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16    1.  Structure of 8 U.S.C. §1225 \nd Srn \nee 17    The statute at the center of this action is 8 U.S.C. §1225, which is entitled, “Inspection by \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  immigration officers; expedited removal of inadmissible arriving aliens; referral for hearing.”  \n19  Paragraph (a) of the statute provides generally that aliens who are arriving in the United States, or \n20  who have not already been admitted, are deemed to be applicants for admission and that they \n21  “shall be inspected by immigration officers.”8 Paragraph (b) then divides such applicants for \n22  admission into two categories. \n23    Subparagraph (b)(1) is entitled, “[i]nspection of aliens arriving in the United States and \n24 \n                                                 \n25  7  Furthermore, defendants have not challenged the standing of the individual plaintiffs to bring \nthese claims or to seek preliminary relief. \n26 \n8 For clarity, all statutory exceptions that are not applicable to plaintiffs and that are not relevant to \n27  the statutory construction analysis will be omitted from quotations and the discussion in this order. \n28   \nCASE NO.  19-cv-00807-RS \n12 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 73   Filed 04/08/19   Page 13 of 27\n \n1  certain other aliens who have not been admitted or paroled.” It provides, in short, that aliens who \n2  arrive in the United States without specified identity and travel documents, or who have \n3  committed fraud in connection with admission, are to be “removed from the United States without \n4  further hearing or review” unless they apply for asylum or assert a fear of persecution. 8 U.S.C. \n5  §1225(b)(1)(A)(i). This procedure is known as “expedited removal.”9   \n6    Subparagraph (b)(1) provides that aliens who indicate either an intention to apply for \n7  asylum or a fear of persecution are to be referred to an asylum officer for an interview. \n8  §1225(b)(1)(A)(ii). The officer is to make a written record of any determination that the alien has \n9  not shown a credible fear. §1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(II). The record is to include a summary of the \n10  material facts presented by the alien, any additional facts relied upon by the officer, and the \n11  officer’s analysis of why, in the light of such facts, the alien has not established a credible fear of \n12  persecution. Id. \n a\n rtni\nouor 13    The alien in that scenario is entitled to review by an immigration judge of any adverse \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  decision, including an opportunity for the alien to be heard and questioned by the immigration \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  judge, either in person or by telephonic or video connection. §1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(II). Additionally, \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  aliens are expressly entitled to receive information concerning the asylum interview and to consult \nd Srn \nee 17  with a person or persons of the alien’s choosing prior to the interview and any review by an \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  immigration judge. §1225(b)(1)(B)(iv). Thus, an alien processed for “expedited” removal under \n19  subparagraph (b)(1) still has substantial procedural safeguards against being removed to a place \n20  where he or she may face persecution. \n21    Subparagraph (b)(2) is entitled, “[i]nspection of other aliens” (emphasis added). It provides \n22  that aliens seeking admission are “to be detained for a proceeding under section 1229a of [Title \n23  8]” unless they are “clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted.” §1225(b)(2)(A). Section \n24 \n                                                 \n25  9 Subparagraph (b)(1) also expressly gives defendants discretion to apply expedited removal to \naliens already present in the United States who have not been legally admitted or paroled, if they \n26 \nare unable to prove continuous presence in the country for more than two years. \n§1225(b)(1)(A)(iii).   \n27 \n28   \nCASE NO.  19-cv-00807-RS \n13 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 73   Filed 04/08/19   Page 14 of 27\n \n1  1229a, in turn, is entitled “Removal proceedings” and sets out the procedures under which \n2  immigration judges generally “conduct proceedings for deciding the inadmissibility or \n3  deportability of an alien.” 8 U.S.C. § 1229a (a)(1).   \n4    Section 1225 subparagraph (b)(2)(B) expressly provides that (b)(2)(A) “shall not apply to \n5  an alien . . . to whom paragraph (1) applies.” Thus, on its face, section 1225 divides applicants for \n6  admission into two mutually exclusive categories. Subparagraph (b)(1) addresses aliens who are \n7  subject to expedited removal. Subparagraph (b)(2) addresses those who are either clearly and \n8  beyond a doubt entitled to admission, or whose application for admission will be evaluated by an \n9  administrative law judge in section 1229a proceedings if they are not. \n10    Although not expressly addressing mutual exclusivity of the two categories, the Supreme \n11  Court has described the operation of section 1225 similarly: \n \n12 \n a [A]pplicants for admission fall into one of two categories, those \n rtni covered by § 1225(b)(1) and those covered by § 1225(b)(2). Section \nouor 13 \nCif 1225(b)(1) applies to aliens initially determined to be inadmissible \nct Cal 14  due to fraud, misrepresentation, or lack of valid documentation. See \ni\nstrof  § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i) (citing §§ 1182(a)(6)(C), (a)(7)) . . . . Section \nDict  15  1225(b)(2) is broader. It serves as a catchall provision that applies to \ns ri\net all applicants for admission not covered by § 1225(b)(1). \ntatDis 16 \nd Srn \nee 17 \nth\nnirt Jennings v. Rodriguez, 138 S. Ct. 830, 837 (2018). \nUo\nN 18 \n  As set out above, there is no dispute that the MPP purports to be an implementation of the \n19 \ncontiguous territory return provision, which appears in the statute as a sub-subparagraph under \n20 \nsubparagraph (b)(2). The provision states, in full: \n21   \nIn the case of an alien described in subparagraph (A) who is arriving \n22 \non land (whether or not at a designated port of arrival) from a \nforeign territory contiguous to the United States, the Attorney \n23 \nGeneral may return the alien to that territory pending a proceeding \n24  under section 1229a of this title. \n25 \n8 U.S.C. §1225(b)(2)(C).10   \n26 \n                                                 \n27 \n10 Plaintiffs’ complaint includes an assertion that the contiguous territory return provision may \n28   \nCASE NO.  19-cv-00807-RS \n14 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 73   Filed 04/08/19   Page 15 of 27\n \n1    On its face, therefore, the contiguous territory return provision may be applied to aliens \n2  described in subparagraph (b)(2)(A). Pursuant to subparagraph (b)(2)(B), however, that expressly \n3  excludes any alien “to whom paragraph (1) applies.” \n4     \n5    2.  Application of the contiguous territory return provision to the individual plaintiffs \n6    At least for purposes of this motion, there is no dispute that the individual plaintiffs are \n7  asylum seekers who lack valid admission documents, and who therefore ordinarily would be \n8  subject to expedited removal proceedings under subparagraph (1) of section 1225. Applying the \n9  plain language of the statute, they simply are not subject to the contiguous territory return \n10  provision. \n11    Defendants advance three basic arguments to contend the plain language should not apply \n12  and that therefore the MPP represents a legal exercise of DHS’s authority under the contiguous \n a\n rtni\nouor 13  return provision. First, defendants rely on well-established law, conceded by plaintiffs, that DHS \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  has prosecutorial discretion to place aliens in regular removal proceedings under section 1229a \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  notwithstanding the fact that they would qualify for expedited removal under subparagraph (b)(1).  \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  Indeed, defendants are correct that the apparently mandatory language of subparagraph (b)(1)—\nd Srn \nee 17  “the officer shall order the alien removed from the United States without further hearing or review \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  . . . .”—does not constrain DHS’s discretion. \n19    In Matter of E-R-M- & L-R-M, 25 I. & N. Dec. 520 (BIA 2011) the Board of Immigration \n20  Appeals rejected a contention that aliens subject to expedited removal could not be placed directly \n21  into 1229a proceedings instead. \n \n22 \n23 \n                                                 \n24  lawfully be applied only to aliens who are “from” the contiguous territory. Complaint, para. 149.  \nIt may be the individual plaintiffs contend they are not subject to the provision because they are \n25 \n“from” countries other than Mexico. Plaintiffs did not advance this point in briefing, and it is not \ncompelling. The statute refers to aliens “arriving on land . . . from a foreign territory contiguous to \n26 \nthe United States.” This language plainly describes the alien’s entry point, not his or her country \nof origin. \n27 \n28   \nCASE NO.  19-cv-00807-RS \n15 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 73   Filed 04/08/19   Page 16 of 27\n \n[W]e observe that the issue arises in the context of a purported \n1 \nrestraint on the DHS’s exercise of its prosecutorial discretion. In that \ncontext, we find that Congress’ use of the term “shall” in section \n2 \n235(b) (1) (A) (i) of the Act does not carry its ordinary meaning, \n3  namely, that an act is mandatory. It is common for the term “shall” \nto mean “may” when it relates to decisions made by the Executive \n4  Branch of the Government on whether to charge an individual and \non what charge or charges to bring.  \n5 \n6 \n25 I. & N. Dec. at 522; see also, Matter of J-A-B, 27 I. & N. Dec. 168 (BIA 2017) (“The DHS’s \n7 \ndecision to commence removal proceedings involves the exercise of prosecutorial discretion, and \n8 \nneither the Immigration Judges nor the Board may review a decision by the DHS to forgo \n9 \nexpedited removal proceedings or initiate removal proceedings in a particular case.”). Plaintiffs do \n10 \nnot dispute that DHS holds such discretion and even expressly acknowledge it in the complaint.  \n11 \nSee Complaint, para. 73 (“Although most asylum seekers at the southern border lack valid entry \n12 \n a\n rtni documents and are therefore eligible to be placed in expedited removal, it is well established that \nouor 13 \nCif\nt al the government has discretion to decline to initiate removal proceedings against any individual; to \ncC 14 \ni\nstrof  determine which charges to bring in removal proceedings; and to place individuals amenable to \nDict  15 \ns ri\net expedited removal in full removal proceedings instead.”) \ntatDis 16 \nd Srn    Thus, defendants are correct that DHS undoubtedly has discretion to institute regular \nee 17 \nth\nnirt removal proceedings even where subparagraph (b)(1) suggests it “shall order the alien removed.”  \nUo\nN 18 \nThe flaw in defendants’ argument, however, is that DHS cannot, merely by placing an individual \n19 \notherwise subject to expedited removal into section 1229a regular removal proceedings instead, \n20 \nsomehow write out of existence the provision in subparagraph (b)(2) of section 1225 that the \n21 \ncontiguous territory return provision does not apply to persons to whom subparagraph (b)(1) does \n22 \napply. Exercising discretion to process an alien under section 1229a instead of expedited removal \n23 \nunder section 1225(b)(1) does not mean the alien is somehow also being processed under section \n24 \n1225(b)(2).  \n25 \n  DHS may choose which enforcement route it wishes to take—1125(b)(1) expedited \n26 \nremoval, or 1229a regular removal—but it is not thereby making a choice as to whether \n27 \n28   \nCASE NO.  19-cv-00807-RS \n16 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 73   Filed 04/08/19   Page 17 of 27\n \n1  1125(b)(1) or 1125(b)(2) applies. The language of those provisions, not DHS, determines into \n2  which of the two categories an alien falls. \n3    The E-R-M- & L-R-M decision further illustrates this distinction. There, as discussed \n4  above, the Board of Immigration Appeals held DHS has discretion to place aliens subject to \n5  expedited removal under subparagraph (b)(1) into regular removal proceedings. Observing that \n6  other aliens are entitled to regular removal under (b)(2), the Board found the express exclusion \n7  from (b)(2) of aliens to whom (b)(1) applies means only that they are not entitled to regular \n8  removal, not that the DHS lacks discretion to place them in it. 25 I. & N. Dec. at 523. Thus, the \n9  decision recognizes that such persons remain among those to whom (b)(1) applies and who are \n10  thereby excluded from treatment under (b)(2). \n11    Defendants’ second argument overlaps with their first. In light of the discretion DHS has to \n12  place aliens eligible for expedited removal into section 1229a proceedings, defendants contend \n a\n rtni\nouor 13  subparagraph (b)(1) only “applies”—thereby triggering the exclusion from subparagraph (b)(2)—\nCif\nt al\ncC 14  when DHS elects actually to apply it to a particular alien.  This argument is not supportable under \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  the statutory language. Subparagraph (b)(2) provides that it “shall not apply to an alien . . . to \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  whom paragraph (1) applies.” The relevant inquiry therefore is whether the language of \nd Srn \nee 17  subparagraph (b)(1) encompasses the alien, not whether DHS has decided to apply the provisions \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  of the subparagraph to him or her. Because there is no dispute the language of subparagraph (b)(1) \n19  describes persons in the position of the individual plaintiffs, the exclusion from subparagraph \n20  (b)(2) reaches them. \n21    Finally, defendants make a statutory intent argument based on the circumstances under \n22  which the contiguous return provision was originally enacted. Defendants assert the provision was \n23  adopted by Congress as a direct response to the Board of Immigration Appeals decision in Matter \n24  of Sanchez-Avila, 21 I. & N. Dec. 444 (BIA 1996). In Sanchez-Avila, the government argued it \n25  had a long-standing and legal practice of, in some instances, “[r]equiring aliens to remain in \n26  Mexico or Canada pending their exclusion proceedings.” Id. at 450. The government noted that it \n27  has “plenary power . . . . to preserve its dominion” and a “legal right to preserve the integrity of its \n28   \nCASE NO.  19-cv-00807-RS \n17 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 73   Filed 04/08/19   Page 18 of 27\n \n1  borders and ultimately its sovereignty.” Id. Accordingly, the government argued, “its exclusion \n2  policy of requiring certain aliens to await their exclusion hearings in either Mexico or Canada” \n3  was “a practical exercise of plenary power.”  Id. \n4     The Sanchez-Avila decision concluded that whatever “plenary power” the government \n5  might otherwise have, it had not shown the alleged practice of returning aliens to Mexico (or \n6  Canada) pending removal proceedings was “longstanding” with an “unchallenged history.”  Id. at \n7  465. Nor could the plaintiffs show there was “explicit statutory or regulatory authority for a \n8  practice of returning applicants for admission at land border ports to Mexico or Canada \n9  to await their hearings.”  Id. As a result, the Board declined to treat the practice as valid. Id. \n10     Defendants contend that because the contiguous territory return provision purportedly was \n11  a direct Congressional response to Sanchez-Avila, it should be seen as authorizing the return of \n12  aliens such as the named plaintiffs. The first and most fundamental problem with defendants’ \n a\n rtni\nouor 13  argument, however, is that the plaintiff alien “returned” to Mexico in Sanchez-Avila was a resident \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  alien commuter whose application for entry was not granted given apparent grounds to exclude \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  him for “involvement with controlled substances.” Id. at 445. Thus, there is no indication he was \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  an undocumented applicant for admission subject to expedited removal under subparagraph (b)(1). \nd Srn \nee 17  To the extent Congressional intent to supersede the result of Sanchez-Avila can be inferred, doing \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  so would not show Congress intended the contiguous territory return provision to apply to aliens \n19  subject to subparagraph (b)(1). \n20     Plaintiffs insist that, to the contrary, it is reasonable to assume Congress affirmatively \n21  wished to exclude aliens subject to expedited removal from the contiguous territory return \n22  provision. Plaintiffs suggest because refugees and asylum seekers are among those most likely to \n23  lack proper admission documents and therefore be subject to expedited removal, it is perfectly \n24  sensible that Congress would expressly exclude them from the contiguous territory return \n25  provision. \n26    The record supports no clear conclusion of any Congressional intent beyond that \n27  implemented in the plain language of the statute. It is certainly possible that if squarely presented \n28   \nCASE NO.  19-cv-00807-RS \n18 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 73   Filed 04/08/19   Page 19 of 27\n \n1  with the question, Congress could and would choose to authorize DHS to impose contiguous \n2  territory return on aliens subject to expedited removal, and that the appearance of the provision in \n3  subparagraph (b)(2) was essentially a matter of poor drafting. It is also possible, however, that \n4  Congress authorized contiguous return only for aliens not subject to expedited removal because \n5  that was the particular issue presented by Sanchez-Avila and/or because there was no indication of \n6  any pressing need to “return” persons during the presumably faster process of expedited \n7  removal.11  Given the unambiguous language and structure of the statute, speculation about \n8  unexpressed Congressional intent does not advance the analysis.  \n9    Finally, the conclusion that plaintiffs and others similarly situated are not subject to the \n10  contiguous territory return provision is neither irrational nor unfair. While at first blush it might \n11  appear they thereby are in a better position than those who are not encompassed by section \n12  1225(b)(1), any such perceived “advantage” flows only from the exercise of DHS’s prosecutorial \n a\n rtni\nouor 13  discretion. If persons in plaintiffs’ position should not be admitted to this country, DHS retains full \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  statutory authority to process them for expedited removal, and to detain them pending such \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  proceedings. Accordingly, plaintiffs have made a strong showing that they are likely to succeed on \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  the merits with respect to their claim that the MPP lacks a legal basis for applying the contiguous \nd Srn \nee 17  territory return provision in this context. \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18   \n19    3.  Refoulement safeguards \n20    Even if, contrary to the preceding discussion, the contiguous territory return provision \n21 \n                                                 \n22 \n11  Even assuming plaintiffs are correct that persons subject to expedited removal are more likely \nto be asylum seekers with credible fear of persecution if not admitted, that alone would not be a \n23 \nbasis to exclude them from contiguous territory return. If the statute were amended, or if the \n24  statutory construction of this order were rejected on appeal, that concern would more appropriately \nbe addressed by adopting appropriate statutory and/or regulatory safeguards against \n25 \n“refoulement,” rather than simply concluding contiguous territory return should never be applied \nto such persons. It is also worth noting that an asylum seeker from some country other than \n26 \nMexico will not automatically be at undue risk of persecution in Mexico, even if he or she can \npresent an extremely compelling case of persecution in his or her country of origin.  \n27 \n28   \nCASE NO.  19-cv-00807-RS \n19 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 73   Filed 04/08/19   Page 20 of 27\n \n1  could be lawfully applied to the individual plaintiffs and others like them, that does not  \n2  end the inquiry. Defendants openly acknowledge they must comply with the government’s legal \n3  obligations to avoid refoulement when removing aliens to a contiguous or any other territory \n4  pending conclusion of section 1229a proceedings. The United States is bound by the United \n5  Nations 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.12 Article 33 of the Convention \n6  provides: \n7 \nNo Contracting State shall expel or return (“refouler”) a refugee in \n8  any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life \nor freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, \n9  nationality, membership of a particular social group or political \nopinion. \n10 \n11    The United States has codified at least some of its obligations under the Convention at 8 \n a 12  U.S.C. §1231(b)(3). That section is entitled “Restriction on removal to a country where alien’s life \n rtni\nouor 13  or freedom would be threatened,” and its provisions and the regulations thereunder provide for \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  hearings and reviews far beyond what is required by the MPP and implementing guidance. DHS \nstrof \nDict  15  insists section 1231(b)(3) and its regulations do not apply here because it refers only to \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  circumstances where an alien is removed, as opposed to “returned.”  \nd Srn \ntehe 17    Defendants’ argument ignores that the section is admittedly intended to implement the \nnirt\nUo\nN 18  United States’ obligations under the Convention, which expressly refer to “expel or return.” \n19  Additionally, while the record is not completely clear, there is a suggestion the prior statutory \n20  language of “deport or return” was amended to substitute the term “remove” only as a result of the \n21  consolidation of deportation and exclusion proceedings into unitary “removal” proceedings in \n22  1996. If so, there would be no reason to infer the change was intended to make a substantive \n23  alteration to the government’s obligations to avoid refoulement.   \n24    That said, it is not clear that defendants would be obligated to provide the full panoply of \n25 \n                                                 \n26 \n12 The United States is not a direct party to the Convention, but is a party to the 1967 Protocol \n27  Relating to the Status of Refugees, which incorporates Articles 2-34 of the Convention. \n28   \nCASE NO.  19-cv-00807-RS \n20 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 73   Filed 04/08/19   Page 21 of 27\n \n1  procedural and substantive protections prescribed under §1231(b)(3) and its implementing \n2  regulations, even assuming the individual plaintiffs are subject to “return” under the contiguous \n3  territory return provision. First, as noted above and as reflected generally in subdivision (b) of \n4  §1231, the potential issues relating to sending an alien to a contiguous territory as opposed to his \n5  or her “home” country may not be identical. Moreover, in this action plaintiffs are not contending \n6  the protections against refoulement provided under subparagraph (b)(1) of section 1225 for those \n7  placed in expedited return are insufficient. Those restrictions are quite clearly less restrictive than \n8  are required under §1231(b)(3). \n9    Second, even though plaintiffs are not contending that DHS must place them in expedited \n10  removal, all their arguments depend on the fact that the expedited removal statute applies to them, \n11  absent prosecutorial discretion. Thus, it would be anomalous to conclude that they necessarily are \n12  entitled to greater procedural and substantive protections against refoulement—i.e., those \n a\n rtni\nouor 13  prescribed by §1231(b)(3)—upon temporary “return” to Mexico than they would receive if the \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  government instead elected simply to remove them permanently on an expedited basis. \ni\nstrof \nDict  15    Accordingly, to the extent plaintiffs contend section §1231(b)(3) applies to persons being \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  “returned” under the contiguous territory return provision, they have not shown they are more \nd Srn \nee 17  likely than not to succeed on the merits of such an argument. That, however, does not answer the \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  question of whether the MPP includes sufficient safeguards against refoulement.  \n19    At the preliminary injunction stage, it is neither possible nor necessary to determine what \n20  the minimal anti-refoulement procedures might be. Plaintiffs have established that persons placed \n21  in expedited removal proceedings, and persons who ultimately are found removable under section \n22  1229a, all benefit from protections not extended to the individual plaintiffs here. The issue in this \n23  case is only whether the MPP’s protections for persons like the individual plaintiffs comply with \n24  the law. Even assuming neither §1231(b)(3) nor the more limited procedures under expedited \n25  removal apply, plaintiffs have shown they are more likely than not to prevail on the merits of their \n26  contention that defendants adopted the MPP without sufficient regard to refoulement issues. \n27  Notably, the CIS Policy Memorandum, AR 2273 n.5, expressly acknowledges the government’s \n28   \nCASE NO.  19-cv-00807-RS \n21 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 73   Filed 04/08/19   Page 22 of 27\n \n1  obligations “vis-à-vis the 1951 Convention and 1967 Protocol are reflected in Section \n2  241(b)(3)(B).” The subsequent conclusion of that memo that “the reference to Section \n3  241(b)(3)(B) should not be construed to suggest that Section 241(b)(3)(B) applies to MPP,” may \n4  ultimately be supportable. It leaves open, however, the question of what the government’s \n5  obligations are.  \n6    As noted above, the MPP provides only for review of potential refoulement concerns when \n7  an alien “affirmatively” raises the point. Access to counsel is “currently” not available. AR 2273.  \n8  While an CIS officer’s determination is subject to review by a supervisory asylum officer, no \n9  administrative review proceedings are available. AR 2274. These procedures undeniably provide \n10  less protection than prior legislative and administrative rulemaking procedures have concluded is \n11  appropriate upon removal, either expedited or regular.  While it might be rational to treat “return” \n12  differently, the rules must be adopted in conformance with administrative law and with \n a\n rtni\nouor 13  governments anti-refoulement obligations. Without opining as to what minimal process might be \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  required, plaintiffs’ showing on this point suffices. \ni\nstrof \nDict  15   \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16    4.  Plaintiffs’ specific claims for relief \nd Srn \nee 17    The first claim for relief set out in the complaint asserts the MPP is “contrary to law” \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  because the contiguous return provision does not apply to persons in the position of the individual \n19  plaintiffs. As set out above, plaintiffs have the better argument on this point. \n20    Plaintiffs’ second claim for relief asserts that under 5 U.S.C. § 553(b) and (c), defendants \n21  may not adopt a “rule” without providing notice and an opportunity for comment. If it were the \n22  case that the MPP represents a lawful exercise of DHS’s discretion to implement the contiguous \n23  territory return provision, plaintiffs would have no tenable “notice and comment” claim regarding \n24  that exercise of prosecutorial discretion. \n25    Additionally, even given the conclusion above that the contiguous return provision does \n26  not provide a legal basis for the MPP, the issue does not rise to a violation of the notice and \n27  comment provisions under the APA. Rather, plaintiffs’ claim for relief with respect to notice and \n28   \nCASE NO.  19-cv-00807-RS \n22 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 73   Filed 04/08/19   Page 23 of 27\n \n1  comment is implicated if, and only if, they are subject to the contiguous territory return provision, \n2  notwithstanding the discussion above. In that instance, the question would be whether the \n3  defendants were obligated to comply with APA notice and comment rules with respect to adopting  \n4  procedures to address refoulement concerns. Plaintiffs’ complaint appears to recognize this point, \n5  and focuses on the allegation that the MPP procedures for addressing an alien’s risk of persecution \n6  upon return to Mexico were not adopted after notice and comment. \n7    If defendants simply were to proceed by applying the existing procedures and regulations \n8  of §1231(b)(3) to temporary “returns” under the contiguous territory return provision, they might \n9  have a good argument that no “notice and comment” procedure would be required. If, however, \n10  defendants take the position—which may be completely reasonable—that a different set of \n11  procedures should apply to contiguous territory “returns,” compliance with APA notice and \n12  comment procedures more likely than not would be required. Accordingly, plaintiffs have shown \n a\n rtni\nouor 13  they have a likelihood of success on the merits of their notice and comment claim. \nCif\nt al\ncC 14    The third claim for relief set out in the complaint alleges, in essence, that the adoption of \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  the MPP was arbitrary and capricious as a whole, and that it effectively “deprives asylum seekers \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  of a meaningful right to apply for asylum.” The sixth claim for relief, which may be duplicative, \nd Srn \nee 17  also asserts impairment of the right to seek asylum. At this juncture, it is not necessary to \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  determine whether plaintiffs might be able to prove such broader and/or “catch-all” claims.  \n19    Finally, the fourth claim for relief13 avers the MPP is contrary to law because it has \n20  inadequate provisions to protect against refoulement. The claim invokes the UN Convention, the \n21  Protocols, section 1231(b)(3), and its implementing regulations. As discussed above, plaintiffs \n22  have not shown they are likely to prove section 1231(b)(3) applies directly. Their claims about \n23  refoulement nevertheless likely merge with their “notice and comment” and/or catch-all claims \n24  under the second and third claims for relief.  Thus, in the event DHS has statutory authority to \n25 \n                                                 \n26 \n13 As noted above, the present motion does not address the fifth claim for relief, which is not \n27  grounded in the APA. \n28   \nCASE NO.  19-cv-00807-RS \n23 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 73   Filed 04/08/19   Page 24 of 27\n \n1  apply the contiguous return provision to plaintiffs and others in their position, plaintiffs have \n2  shown a likelihood of success on the refoulement issue, whether that is best characterized as a \n3  claim under their second, third, or fourth claims for relief, or some combination thereof.    \n4   \n5    C.  Other injunction factors \n6    Under the familiar standards, plaintiffs who demonstrate a likelihood of success on the \n7  merits, as plaintiffs have done here, must also show they are “likely to suffer irreparable harm in \n8  the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in [their] favor, and that an \n9  injunction is in the public interest.”  Winter, 555 U.S. at 21-22. While the precise degree of risk \n10  and specific harms that plaintiffs might suffer in this case may be debatable, there is no real \n11  question that it includes the possibility of irreparable injury, sufficient to support interim relief in \n12  light of the showing on the merits. \n a\n rtni\nouor 13    The individual plaintiffs present uncontested evidence that they fled their homes in El \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to escape extreme violence, including rape and death threats. \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  One plaintiff alleges she was forced to flee Honduras after her life was threatened for being a \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  lesbian. Another contends he suffered beatings and death threats by a “death squad” in Guatemala \nd Srn \nee 17  that targeted him for his indigenous identity. Plaintiffs contend they have continued to experience \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  physical and verbal assaults, and live in fear of future violence, in Mexico. \n19    Defendants attempt to rebut the plaintiffs’ showing of harm by arguing the merits—\n20  contending the individual plaintiffs were all “processed consistent[ly] with applicable law” and \n21  had sufficient opportunity to assert any legitimate fears of return to Mexico. As reflected in the \n22  discussion above, however, plaintiffs have made a strong showing that defendants’ view of the \n23  law on those points is not correct. The organizational plaintiffs have also shown a likelihood of \n24  harm in terms of impairment of their ability to carry out their core mission of providing \n25  representation to aliens seeking admission, including asylum seekers. Cf. East Bay Sanctuary, 909 \n26  F.3d at 1242 (describing cognizable harms to organizational plaintiffs for standing purposes.) \n27    Finally, the balance of equities and the public interest support issuance of preliminary \n28   \nCASE NO.  19-cv-00807-RS \n24 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 73   Filed 04/08/19   Page 25 of 27\n \n1  relief. As observed in East Bay Sanctuary: \n \n2 \nthe public has a “weighty” interest “in efficient administration of the \nimmigration laws at the border.” Landon v. Plasencia, 459 U.S. 21, \n3 \n34, 103 S.Ct. 321, 74 L.Ed.2d 21 (1982). But the public also has an \ninterest in ensuring that “statutes enacted by [their] representatives” \n4 \nare not imperiled by executive fiat. Maryland v. King, 567 U.S. \n5  1301, 1301, 133 S.Ct. 1, 183 L.Ed.2d 667 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., in \nchambers). \n6 \n909 F.3d at 1255. Additionally, similar to the situation in East Bay Sanctuary, while this \n7 \ninjunction will bring a halt to a current and expanding policy, and in that sense technically does \n8 \nnot preserve the “status quo,” it will only “temporarily restore[] the law to what it had been for \n9 \nmany years prior.” Id.  \n10 \n \n11 \n  D.  Scope of injunction \n12 \n a\n ourtorni 13    Defendants urge that any injunction be limited in geographical scope. As the East Bay \nCif\nt al Sanctuary court recently observed, there is “a growing uncertainty about the propriety of universal \ncC 14 \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  injunctions.” 909 F.3d at 1255.   \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16    Nevertheless, as East Bay Sanctuary also noted: \ned Sern  17   In immigration matters, we have consistently recognized the \nth\nnirt authority of district courts to enjoin unlawful policies on a universal \nUo\nN 18  basis. Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v.

Although issues sometimes arise when a ruling in a single judicial district is applied \n2  nationwide, defendants have not shown the injunction in this case can be limited geographically. \n3  This is not a case implicating local concerns or values. There is no apparent reason that any of the \n4  places to which the MPP might ultimately be extended have interests that materially differ from \n5  those presented in San Ysidro. Accordingly, the injunction will not be geographically limited.14 \n6     \n7    E.  Bond and stay issues \n8    No party has suggested that it would be appropriate to condition issuance of a preliminary \n9  injunction upon the posting of a bond under the circumstances of this case. No bond will be \n10  required.15 At argument, defendants moved orally for a stay pending appeal of any injunctive relief \n11  that might issue. Defendants contend the MPP was adopted to address certain aspects of a crisis. \n12  Even fully crediting defendants’ characterization of the circumstances, they have not shown that a \n a\n rtni\nouor 13  stay of this injunction is warranted. See East Bay Sanctuary, 909 F.3d at 1255. Accordingly, the \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  request for a stay during the pendency of appeal will be denied. To permit defendants to exercise \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  their right to seek a stay from the Court of Appeal, however, this order will not take effect until \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  5:00 p.m., PST, April 12, 2019. \nd Srn     \nee 17 \nth\nUniort                                                  \nN 18 \n14  While the injunction precludes the “return” under the MPP of any additional aliens who would \n19  otherwise be subject to expedited removal, nothing in the order determines if any individuals, \nother than those appearing as plaintiffs in this action, should be offered the opportunity to re-enter \n20  the United States pending conclusion of their section1229a proceedings. Nor does anything in the \ninjunctive relief require that any person be paroled into the country during such proceedings. DHS \n21 \nwill have discretion to detain the individual plaintiffs and others when they are allowed back \nacross the border. \n22 \n15 On its face, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c) permits a court to grant preliminary \n23 \ninjunctive relief “only if the movant gives security in an amount that the court considers proper to \n24  pay the costs and damages sustained by any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined or \nrestrained.” The Ninth Circuit has made clear, however, that “[d]espite the seemingly mandatory \n25 \nlanguage, Rule 65(c) invests the district court with discretion as to the amount of security required, \nif any.” Johnson v. Couturier, 572 F.3d 1067, 1086 (9th Cir. 2009)(citations and quotations \n26 \nomitted, emphasis in original). This is not a case where a bond would serve to protect against \nquantifiable harm in any event.  \n27 \n28   \nCASE NO.  19-cv-00807-RS \n26 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 73   Filed 04/08/19   Page 27 of 27\n \n1  V.

This case challenges the federal government’s new policy of forcing asylum seekers to \n3 \nreturn to danger in Mexico while they await their removal proceedings, in violation of the \n4 \nhumanitarian protections to which they are entitled under United States and international law.    \n5 \n2.  Plaintiffs are individual asylum seekers from Central America who are now living in fear in \n6 \nMexico because they were returned there under the new policy, as well as legal organizations \n7 \n8  whose missions to provide representation to such asylum seekers are being thwarted by the physical \n9  removal of those asylum seekers from the United States.  \n10 \n3.  Since the enactment of the 1980 Refugee Act nearly forty years ago, U.S. law has prohibited \n11 \nthe return of individuals to countries where they are likely to face persecution, while providing an \n12 \nasylum procedure by which individuals fleeing persecution can seek and obtain permanent safety. \n13 \nBut at the end of January, the government began to implement a new policy that eviscerates both of \n14 \nthese fundamental protections. \n15 \n16  4.   Under the new policy, immigration authorities are forcing asylum seekers at the southern \n17  border of the United States to return to Mexico—to regions experiencing record levels of \n18 \nviolence—where they must remain for the duration of their asylum proceedings. By placing them in \n19 \nsuch danger, and under conditions that make if difficult if not impossible for them to prepare their \n20 \ncases, Defendants are depriving them of a meaningful opportunity to seek asylum.   \n21 \n5.  Moreover, the procedure Defendants have implemented for determining who can be \n22 \nreturned under the policy is wholly inadequate for ensuring that those who face persecution, torture, \n23 \n24  or death in Mexico will not be erroneously returned. Indeed, the procedure is unlike any that \n25 \nDefendants have previously used to adjudicate such claims for protection. Yet Defendants’ policy \n26 \nmemoranda contain no explanation for such a departure.  \n27 \n28 \n     \n2 \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807   Document 1   Filed 02/14/19   Page 4 of 41\n1  6.  Defendants call their new forced return policy the “Migrant Protection Protocols” (“MPP”). \n2 \nIt was first announced by Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen M. Nielsen on December 20, \n3 \n2018, and implemented at the San Ysidro Port of Entry in California on January 28, 2019. \n4 \nDefendants recently announced imminent expansion of the policy to the Eagle Pass Port of Entry, \n5 \nwith other Texas locations soon to follow.       \n6 \n7.  The new policy violates the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”) and the \n7 \n8  Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”). It violates the INA because the authority Defendants cite \n9  for the policy, INA § 235(b)(2)(C), 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(2)(C)—a provision that allows the return \n10 \npending removal proceedings of certain noncitizens who arrive by land from a contiguous foreign \n11 \nterritory—cannot be used against the asylum seekers to whom Defendants are applying it. It also \n12 \nviolates INA § 208, 8 U.S.C. §1158 (establishing a right to apply for asylum), and INA § 241(b)(3), \n13 \n8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3) (prohibiting removal to a country where one would face persecution). The \n14 \npolicy violates the APA, because Defendants failed to comply with the APA’s notice and comment \n15 \n16  requirements and because the policy is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. \n17  8.    Plaintiffs seek a declaration that the policy is illegal and an injunction enjoining its \n18 \noperation. \n19 \nJURISDICTION & VENUE \n20 \n9.

Asylum Seekers at the U.S.-Mexico Border, Including the Named Plaintiffs, Are \n15 \n16  Fleeing Horrendous Violence  \n17  39.  Asylum seekers who arrive at the southern border seeking protection in the United States \n18 \nare fleeing some of the most dangerous countries in the world.   \n19 \n40.  Although these asylum seekers come from all over the world, most come from El Salvador, \n20 \nGuatemala, and Honduras. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \n21 \n(“UNHCR”), these countries are experiencing epidemic levels of violence. Human rights groups \n22 \nhave compared the levels of violence in this region to those typically seen in war zones. \n23 \n24  41.  Those who flee are often escaping life-threatening situations. In particular, violence by \n25 \ncriminal armed groups has escalated dramatically in Central America, and those governments have \n26 \nbeen unable or unwilling to provide effective protection.  \n27 \n28 \n     \n8 \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807   Document 1   Filed 02/14/19   Page 10 of 41\n1  42.  The vast majority of the migrants coming to the southern border have legitimate claims to \n2 \nasylum.    \n3 \n43.  Between fiscal years 2014 and 2016, 12,350 people from El Salvador, Guatemala, and \n4 \nHonduras were granted asylum. Between fiscal years 2010 and 2016, the percentage of asylum \n5 \nseekers from these countries granted protection increased by 96 percent. \n6 \n44.  The Individual Plaintiffs sought asylum in the United States because they have experienced \n7 \n8  persecution—including brutal beatings, death threats, and rape—in their countries of origin.   \n9  45.  For example, Plaintiff Bianca Doe, a lesbian woman from Honduras, fears returning to her \n10 \nhome country where LGBTQ individuals like her face discrimination, violence, and death, and \n11 \nreceive no protection from the authorities. In Honduras, Bianca became pregnant by a man who \n12 \nraped her because of her sexual orientation, and who was then granted custody of their son by  a \n13 \nHonduran judge who cited the fact Bianca was a lesbian as evidence of her unfitness as a parent. \n14 \nBianca was forced to flee Honduras after her partner’s abusive father discovered their relationship, \n15 \n16  and threatened to kill them both if Bianca did not leave the country immediately.     \n17  46.  Plaintiff John Doe is an indigenous man from Guatemala who suffered brutal beatings and \n18 \ndeath threats at the hands of a “death squad” that controls his town. The death squad targeted him \n19 \nfor his indigenous identity, frequently taunting him with indigenous slurs when they attacked him. \n20 \nSome of the attacks left him bloodied and unconscious. John reported the first beating to the police, \n21 \nbut they did nothing to protect him.   \n22 \n47.  Plaintiff Ian Doe is a former police officer from Honduras who worked undercover to \n23 \n24  interdict drug trafficking activity. He fled the country to seek asylum in the U.S. after his identity \n25 \nwas revealed to the drug traffickers and they came after him. Ian narrowly escaped with his life. \n26 \nAfter he left the country, the drug traffickers killed his brother, believing that he was Ian.   \n27 \n28 \n     \n9 \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807   Document 1   Filed 02/14/19   Page 11 of 41\n1  48.  Plaintiff Alex Doe is a youth pastor and organizer from Honduras who works with young \n2 \npeople who are former or current gang members, or at risk of being forcibly recruited by gangs, \n3 \nAfter he helped organize a strike to protest the killing of a young member of his church by a \n4 \npowerful gang, he was featured on the national news denouncing the gang and demanding the \n5 \nHonduran government provide more security. He was forced to flee after the gang threatened his \n6 \nlife. \n7 \n8  B.  Asylum Seekers, Including the Named Plaintiffs, Face Extreme Danger in Mexico \n9  49.  Like the Individual Plaintiffs, many asylum seekers from Central American have no choice \n10 \nbut to travel by land to the United States due to documentation requirements that would be \n11 \nnecessary to board a plane, as well as financial constraints. Although this means they must cross \n12 \nthrough Mexico before reaching the United States, for most, remaining in Mexico is not an option. \n13 \n50.  According to the U.S. Department of State, “violence against migrants by government \n14 \nofficers and organized criminal groups” is one of “[t]he most significant human rights issues” in \n15 \n16  the Mexico. The State Department also reports that the dangers that forced many Central American \n17  migrants to flee their homes are likewise present in Mexico, as the presence of Central American \n18 \ngangs has “spread farther into the country and threatened migrants who had fled the same gangs in \n19 \ntheir home countries.” \n20 \n51.  Asylum seekers in Mexico face a heightened risk of kidnapping, disappearance, trafficking, \n21 \nsexual assault, and murder, among other harms. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender persons, \n22 \nas well as people of indigenous heritage, are particularly at risk.  \n23 \n24  52.  Even before they were subjected to Defendants new forced return policy, many of the \n25 \nIndividual Plaintiffs had already been the victims of discrimination, robbery, extortion, kidnapping, \n26 \nand assault in Mexico.  \n27 \n28 \n     \n10 \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807   Document 1   Filed 02/14/19   Page 12 of 41\n1  53.  For example, Mexican police detained Plaintiff Ian Doe several times and demanded his \n2 \nimmigration documents. About a month ago, officers required him to pay a bribe of 1,500 pesos to \n3 \navoid being arrested and taken to jail.  \n4 \n54.  Similarly, Plaintiff Christopher Doe was stopped by the Mexican police who threatened that \n5 \nthey would take him to jail if they saw him on the street again. \n6 \n55.  Plaintiff Howard Doe was robbed at gunpoint by two Mexican men in Tijuana just days \n7 \n8  before he presented himself at the port of entry. The robbers said they knew that he was Honduran, \n9  and that if they saw him again, they would kill him.   \n10 \n56.  Plaintiff Gregory Doe was staying at a shelter in Tijuana when a mob of young men \n11 \nwielding sticks surrounded the shelter and threatened the residents.   \n12 \n57.  Plaintiff Alex Doe was staying in the Playas neighborhood of Tijuana when he and other \n13 \nasylum seekers were forced to flee in the middle of the night after a group of Mexicans threw stones \n14 \nat them and additional attackers began to gather with sticks and other weapons.   \n15 \n16  58.  While traveling through Mexico on his way to the U.S.-Mexico border, Plaintiff Howard \n17  Doe was kidnapped and held for more than two weeks by members of a Mexican drug cartel until \n18 \nhe and several others were able to escape. He fears that the well-connected cartel will find him in \n19 \nthe border region and torture and murder him for escaping.   \n20 \n59.  President Trump has himself acknowledged that Mexico is not a safe place for migrants, \n21 \ntweeting on January 31, 2019: “Very sadly, Murder cases in Mexico in 2018 rose 33% from 2017, \n22 \nto 33,341.” He further stated that the situation in Mexico is “[w]orse even than Afghanistan.” \n23 \n24  60.  Moreover, the border regions where asylum seekers subjected to Defendants’ new policy \n25 \nwill be returned are especially dangerous. Tijuana, the city where Individual Plaintiffs and other \n26 \nmigrants returned from the San Ysidro port of entry are being dumped, is one of the deadliest cities \n27 \nin  the  world. Tijuana  had  its  highest  number  of  reported  murders  ever  last  year,  and  Baja \n28 \n     \n11 \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807   Document 1   Filed 02/14/19   Page 13 of 41\n1  California, the state in which Tijuana is located, was the state in Mexico with the highest number \n2 \nof reported murders last year. Asylum seekers in Tijuana have been the direct targets of violence. \n3 \nAmong the incidents of violence documented by human rights groups in recent months, two \n4 \nteenagers from Honduras were kidnapped and murdered in Tijuana last December. \n5 \n61.  Similar dangers face asylum seekers who will soon be forced to return from the Eagle Pass \n6 \nPort of Entry and will be dumped in Coahuila state. The U.S. Department of State advises that \n7 \n8  Americans reconsider travel to Coahuila because violent crime and gang activity are common, and \n9  U.S. employees traveling in Piedras Negras, the town across from Eagle Pass, must observe a \n10 \nnighttime curfew. \n11 \n62.  In addition to fearing discrimination and violence in Mexico, several of the Individual \n12 \nPlaintiffs fear that Mexico will unlawfully deport them to their home countries where they face \n13 \npersecution.  \n14 \n63.  There is no functioning asylum system in Mexico, and Central American asylum seekers \n15 \n16  face  a  substantial  risk  of  being  involuntarily  repatriated  to  the  countries  they  have  fled. \n17  Intergovernmental  and  human  rights  organizations  have  documented  widespread  instances  of \n18 \nMexican officials returning Central American migrants to their home countries despite their fears \n19 \nof persecution or torture, without any meaningful process. \n20 \n64.  The U.S. Department of State’s 2017 Human Rights Report on Mexico notes “incidents in \n21 \nwhich immigration agents had been known to threaten and abuse migrants to force them to accept \n22 \nvoluntary deportation and discourage them from seeking asylum.” \n23 \n24  65.  For example, when Plaintiff Dennis Doe first entered Mexico en route to the United States, \n25 \nhe was apprehended by Mexican officials who deported him without asking him if he wished to \n26 \napply for asylum or if he feared returning to his home country.  \n27 \n28 \n     \n12 \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807   Document 1   Filed 02/14/19   Page 14 of 41\n1  66.  Similarly, Plaintiff Alex Doe witnessed Mexican authorities deport several immigrants \n2 \nsimply for being in an area where someone had started a fight.  \n3 \n67.  Plaintiff Kevin Doe and his wife were arrested by Mexican immigration authorities after \n4 \nthey entered the country. The authorities separated Kevin from wife and deported her to Honduras, \n5 \neven though she told them that she was pregnant and scared to return to Honduras \n6 \n68.  President Trump recently advocated for Mexico to deport individuals who arrived on \n7 \n8  “caravans,” regardless of their claims for asylum and other protection: “Mexico should move the \n9  flag waving Migrants, many of whom are stone cold criminals, back to their countries. Do it by \n10 \nplane, do it by bus, do it anyway (sic) you want, but they are NOT coming into the U.S.A. We will \n11 \nclose the Border permanently if need be.”  \n12 \n69.  The conditions in Mexico will make it difficult if not impossible for asylum seekers to \n13 \nmeaningfully  exercise  their  right  to  apply  for  asylum. Asylum  seekers  who  are  attacked, \n14 \nkidnapped, or killed in Mexico will be wholly unable to pursue their asylum applications.  \n15 \n16  70.  For those who escape violence but nonetheless live in fear of harm, the psychological \n17  strains of navigating danger, necessary limitations on their movement to avoid violence, lack of a \n18 \nsecure place to live, and other challenges will prevent them from being able to devote the time \n19 \nneeded  to  meaningfully  prepare  for  their  asylum  proceedings—a  process  that,  under  normal \n20 \nconditions, can require hundreds of hours.  \n21 \n71.  Instead of being able to focus on preparing their cases, asylum seekers forced to return to \n22 \nMexico will have to focus on trying to survive. These pressures may deter even those with the \n23 \n24  strongest asylum claims to give up, rather than endure the wait under such conditions. \n25 \nC.  Asylum Procedures at the U.S.-Mexico Border \n26 \n72.  Until recently, individuals applying for asylum at the southern border were either placed in \n27 \nexpedited removal proceedings under INA § 235(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1) or placed in full \n28 \n     \n13 \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807   Document 1   Filed 02/14/19   Page 15 of 41\n1  removal proceedings under INA § 240, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a. Expedited removal allows for the \n2 \nimmediate removal of noncitizens who lack valid entry documents or attempt to enter the U.S. \n3 \nthrough fraud—unless they express a fear removal. See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i).  \n4 \n73.  Although most asylum seekers at the southern border lack valid entry documents and are \n5 \ntherefore eligible to be placed in expedited removal, it is well established that the government has \n6 \ndiscretion to decline to initiate removal proceedings against any individual; to determine which \n7 \n8  charges to bring in removal proceedings; and to place individuals amenable to expedited removal \n9  in full removal proceedings instead.   \n10 \n74.  Regardless  of  whether  they  were  placed  in  expedited  removal  or  regular  removal \n11 \nproceedings,  prior  to  Defendants’  new  policy  asylum  seekers  went  through  these  removal \n12 \nproceedings inside the United States. Those who were placed in expedited removal needed to pass \n13 \na credible fear interview with an asylum officer first. But once they passed this interview—by \n14 \nshowing a “significant possibility” that they could establish eligibility for asylum, 8 U.S.C. § \n15 \n16  1225(b)(1)(B)(v), a low threshold—they were placed in regular removal proceedings.   \n17  75.  Those who were not placed in expedited removal were simply placed in regular removal \n18 \nproceedings without going through the credible fear process. \n19 \n76.  Both categories of asylum seekers—those who were placed in regular removal proceedings \n20 \nafter first passing a credible fear interview, and those who were placed in removal proceedings \n21 \nwithout such an interview—could either be held in detention or released pursuant to parole or bond \n22 \npending completion of their asylum proceedings.   \n23 \n24  77.  Whether detained or released, however, no asylum seeker could be physically removed \n25 \nfrom the United States without an order of removal duly issued by either an immigration judge in \n26 \nfull removal proceedings or, for those asylum seekers who failed to pass a credible fear screening, \n27 \nby an immigration adjudicator in expedited removal proceedings. \n28 \n     \n14 \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807   Document 1   Filed 02/14/19   Page 16 of 41\n1   \n2 \nD.  Defendants’ New Forced Return Policy  \n3 \n78.  On December 20, 2018, DHS Secretary Nielsen announced an “unprecedented” change to \n4 \nthe existing policy. In what DHS described as an “historic action to confront illegal immigration,” \n5 \nDefendant Nielsen announced a new policy, dubbed the “Migrant Protection Protocols” (“MPP”), \n6 \nunder which DHS would begin requiring noncitizens who seek admission from Mexico “illegally \n7 \n8  or without proper documentation” to be “returned to Mexico for the duration of their immigration \n9  proceedings.” \n10 \n79.  According to DHS, the new policy would address the problem of noncitizens who allegedly \n11 \n“game the system” and “disappear into the United States,” and deter migrants from making “false” \n12 \nasylum claims at the border, “while ensuring that vulnerable populations receive the protections \n13 \nthey need.”  \n14 \n80.  Subsequently, in a press release justifying the new policy, DHS cited “[m]isguided court \n15 \n16  decisions and outdated laws [that] have made it easier for illegal aliens to enter and remain in the \n17  U.S.,” especially “adults who arrive with children, unaccompanied alien children, or individuals \n18 \nwho fraudulently claim asylum.” DHS stated that the new policy “will discourage individuals from \n19 \nattempting illegal entry and making false claims to stay in the U.S. and allow more resources to be \n20 \ndedicated to individuals who legitimately qualify for asylum.”  \n21 \n81.  More than a month later, in late January 2019, DHS issued a handful of memoranda and \n22 \nguidance documents implementing its new forced return policy.  \n23 \n24  82.  On January 25, 2019, a memo issued by Defendant Nielsen stated that implementation of \n25 \nthe forced return policy would be “on a large scale basis.”   \n26 \n27 \n28 \n     \n15 \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807   Document 1   Filed 02/14/19   Page 17 of 41\n1  83.  A few days later, a memorandum issued by CBP Commissioner McAleenan announced \n2 \nthat Defendants would begin implementing the new policy at the San Ysidro Port of Entry on \n3 \nJanuary 28, 2019, and that expansion was anticipated “in the near future.”  \n4 \n84.  During the first two weeks the policy was in place at San Ysidro, the asylum seekers forced \n5 \nto return to Mexico were all single adults. On February 13, 2019, several asylum-seeking families \n6 \nwere returned to Mexico, one of which included a one-year old child.   \n7 \n8  85.   On February 11, 2019, a DHS official informed the media that the forced return policy \n9  would imminently be expanded to the Eagle Pass Port of Entry in Texas, and thereafter throughout \n10 \nTexas. \n11 \n E.  Purported Legal Authority for Defendants’ Forced Return Policy  \n12 \n86.  Defendants claim that authority for their new forced return policy comes from INA § \n13 \n235(b)(2)(C), 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(2)(C).    \n14 \n87.  Section 1225(b)(2)(C) authorizes DHS to “return” certain individuals who are “arriving on \n15 \n16  land (whether or not at a designated port of arrival) from a foreign territory contiguous to the \n17  United States” to that contiguous territory during the pendency of their removal proceedings.  \n18 \n88.  The provision was enacted in 1996 at the same time Congress enacted expedited removal. \n19 \nIt specifically exempts from its coverage those individuals to whom the expedited removal statute \n20 \n“applies.” 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(2)(B)(ii).  \n21 \n89.  Defendants  state  that  their  forced  return  policy  does  not  apply  to  anyone  who  was \n22 \n“processed for expedited removal.” CBP, MPP Guiding Principles, at *1 (dated Jan. 28, 2019). \n23 \n24  However, the population that is expressly targeted by the policy—asylum seekers who cross the \n25 \nborder  illegally  or  who  present  themselves  for  admission  at  a  port  of  entry  without  proper \n26 \ndocuments—is precisely the population to whom the expedited removal statute applies.   \n27 \n28 \n     \n16 \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807   Document 1   Filed 02/14/19   Page 18 of 41\n1  90.  Defendants’ broad application of Section 1225(b)(2)(C) to this population constitutes a \n2 \nmajor departure from the agency’s prior practice.   \n3 \n91.  Between 1997 and 2005, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”), the precursor \n4 \nagency  to  DHS,  issued  a  number  of  memoranda  purporting  to  authorize  the  use  of  Section \n5 \n1225(b)(2)(C) in expedited removal proceedings. However, this authority appears never to have \n6 \nbeen exercised, at least not on the “large scale” that is currently anticipated for the forced return \n7 \n8  policy.  \n9  92.  The INS memoranda specify the limited circumstances in which Section 1225(b)(2)(C) was \n10 \nto be used: only in the event of “insufficient detention space” and “as a last resort,” 2001.03, INS \n11 \nInsp. Field Manual 17.15, and only for individuals who did not “express[]a fear of persecution \n12 \nrelated to Canada or Mexico.” Memorandum for Regional Directors from Michael A. Pearson, INS \n13 \nExecutive  Associate  Commissioner  of  Field  Operations  on  Detention  Guidelines  (“Pearson \n14 \nMemo”) at *3 (Oct. 7, 1998) (“If an alien expresses a fear of persecution related to Canada or \n15 \n16  Mexico, the alien  . . . may not be required to wait in that country for a determination of the \n17  claim.”). \n18 \n93.  Other guidance issued in 2005 to authorize use of the return authority against certain \n19 \nCubans specifies that it was limited to 1) individuals who had permission to legally reside in the \n20 \ncontiguous territory to which they were being returned, and 2) who were ineligible for release from \n21 \ndetention  on  discretionary  parole.  2006.03.27,  ICE  Detention  &  Deportation  Officers’  Field \n22 \nManual, Appx. 16-6.  \n23 \n24  94.   The “MPP Guiding Principles” for Defendants’ forced return policy do not include such \n25 \nconstraints. CBP officers have discretion whether to subject migrants to forced return under the \n26 \npolicy,  or  instead  to  process  them  under  regular  removal  proceedings  or  expedited  removal \n27 \nproceedings. In making this decision, however, officers are not required to consider the availability \n28 \n     \n17 \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807   Document 1   Filed 02/14/19   Page 19 of 41\n1  of detention space or whether the individual could be released on parole in lieu of being returned to \n2 \nMexico.  \n3 \n95.  Nor are officers required to consider whether the individual has a legal status in Mexico for \n4 \nthe duration of removal proceedings or has a place to reside, nor whether the individual could be \n5 \ngravely harmed in ways that may not amount to persecution or torture.   \n6 \n \n7 \n8  F.  Plaintiffs Have Been Harmed by Defendants’ Inadequate Procedures for Determining \n9  Whether They Will Face Persecution or Torture in Mexico. \n10 \n96.  The Guiding Principles do require that Defendants consider whether an individual is “more \n11 \nlikely than not” to face persecution or torture if returned to Mexico—the standard required to \n12 \nobtain “withholding of removal” and one of the few exceptions to the forced return policy. \n13 \n97.  On January 28, 2019, USCIS issued guidance setting forth the procedure for making this \n14 \ndetermination. See USCIS Policy Guidance, PM-602-0169, Guidance for Implementing Section \n15 \n16  235(b)(2)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Migrant Protection Protocols, dated \n17  Jan. 28, 2019 (“USCIS Guidance”). The procedure established for making this determination is \n18 \nextremely truncated and lacking in basic safeguards.   \n19 \n98.  First, to receive a determination under the procedure, an asylum seeker must, without notice, \n20 \naffirmatively state a fear of persecution. Then the individual must establish before an asylum officer \n21 \nthat they are entitled to withholding or CAT protection on the merits—i.e., that it is more likely \n22 \nthan not they will be persecuted or tortured.  \n23 \n24  99.  The asylum seeker is not permitted to consult with counsel either before or after the \n25 \ninterview. In addition, there is no guarantee of an interpreter to assist at the interview. \n26 \n100.  The asylum officer’s determination is reviewed by a supervisory asylum officer. No other \n27 \nappeal or review is available. Moreover, if while in Mexico the individual suffers actual persecution \n28 \n     \n18 \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807   Document 1   Filed 02/14/19   Page 20 of 41\n1  or torture, or other changed circumstances arise that might affect the determination, there is no \n2 \nopportunity to revisit a negative determination, until the individual returns to the port of entry for \n3 \ntheir scheduled removal hearing \n4 \n101.  These procedures are a stark departure from procedures the Executive Branch has adopted to \n5 \nimplement its duty of nonrefoulement. In regular removal proceedings, for example, the decision \n6 \nwhether an individual faces persecution or torture is made in a hearing before an immigration judge, \n7 \n8  with a right to counsel, present evidence, and cross-examine witnesses, and then with a right to seek \n9  administrative and judicial review. \n10 \n102.  Although this new procedure effects a sea change in the treatment of asylum seekers, \n11 \nDefendants adopted it without undertaking notice-and-comment rulemaking. A proposed \n12 \nregulation, “Return to Territory,” appeared on a list of anticipated rulemaking in the fall of 2017, \n13 \nspring of 2017, and fall of 2018, but was withdrawn on December 21, 2018. \n14 \n103.  Moreover, the Individual Plaintiffs’ experiences demonstrate that asylum seekers are not \n15 \n16  even being referred to asylum officers despite their real fears of return to Mexico. Instead, \n17  Defendants are simply processesing asylum seekers for forced return.  \n18 \n104.  Prior to their interviews, the Individual Plaintiffs were kept overnight in a “hielera” or “ice \n19 \nbox,” a small locked holding cell packed with dozens of other migrants. The Individual Plaintiffs \n20 \nand other migrants were given only a thin mat to sleep on and an aluminum emergency blanket. But \n21 \nthey got little to no rest before their interviews. The overly crowded cells were freezing, the bright \n22 \nlights were never turned out, and there was constant activity. Many of the Plaintiffs were not given \n23 \n24  sufficient food.  \n25 \n105.  In contrast to other screenings conducted by Defendants, Individual Plaintiffs received no \n26 \n“rest period” to ensure they were prepared to testify to their fear of persecution. Indeed, several of \n27 \nthe Individual Plaintiffs were even called out and interviewed in the middle of the night.     \n28 \n     \n19 \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807   Document 1   Filed 02/14/19   Page 21 of 41\n1  106.  Moreover, the Individual Plaintiffs’ interviews were cursory. For example, Kevin Doe’s \n2 \ninterview with CBP lasted all of five minutes, and he was never asked about his fear of being \n3 \nreturned to Mexico. \n4 \n107.  Christopher Doe—who has a first-grade education and childhood head injury that impairs \n5 \nhis learning and memory—tried to explain that he had been attacked while in Mexico at his \n6 \ninterview, but was abruptly cut off by the CBP officer and never referred to an asylum officer. \n7 \n8  Christopher’s interview lasted all of 10 to 15 minutes. The officer was impatient and angry, and \n9  frequently interrupted him, repeatedly saying “No!” in response to his answers. At the conclusion of \n10 \nthe interview, the officer instructed Christopher to sign forms he did not understand, including \n11 \nforms that were only provided to him in English. \n12 \n108.  Similarly, Ian Doe was never asked about fear of return to Mexico, and the CBP officer \n13 \nfrequently cut him off and did not allow him to fully answer his questions. When Ian explained he \n14 \ndid not feel safe in Mexico, the officer replied “that it was too bad. He said that [] Honduras wasn’t \n15 \n16  safe, Mexico wasn’t safe, and the U.S. isn’t safe either . . . He told me I’d have to figure out how to \n17  survive in Tijuana.” Ian was also directed to sign documents that were written in English, and he \n18 \nwas not offered any interpretation before signing. He later found out the officer had written that Ian \n19 \nhad stated that “Mexico” had offered him asylum, even though he never said that. Despite \n20 \nexpressing a fear of return, Ian was never referred to an asylum officer. \n21 \n109.  Indeed, almost none of the Individual Plaintiffs were asked by CBP about their fears of \n22 \nbeing returned to Mexico.  \n23 \n24  110.  Although two Plaintiffs, Howard Doe and Frank Doe, were referred to an asylum officer \n25 \nafter expressing their fear of return, they were summarily returned to Mexico with no explanation. \n26 \n27 \n28 \n     \n20 \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807   Document 1   Filed 02/14/19   Page 22 of 41\n1  111.  The CBP officers did not explain the purpose of the interview to the Individual Plaintiffs. \n2 \nSeveral Plaintiffs only realized they were being returned to Mexico at the conclusion of their \n3 \ninterviews. \n4 \n112.  In several cases, as with Christopher Doe and Ian Doe, CBP officers frequently interrupted \n5 \nPlaintiffs and did not permit them to fully answer questions or provide additional information. \n6 \n113.  Several CBP officers spoke only limited Spanish and could not communicate effectively \n7 \n8  with Plaintiffs during their interviews. Nor did those officers provide Plaintiffs with an interpreter. \n9  For example, Bianca Doe was interviewed by an agent who struggled to speak Spanish. \n10 \n114.  In several cases, as with Christopher Doe and Ian Doe, Plaintiffs were directed to sign forms \n11 \nin English that they did not understand and that were not explained to them. \n12 \nG.   Plaintiffs Are Unable to Meaningfully Access the Asylum Process From Mexico    \n13 \n115.  Many of the Individual Plaintiffs fear they will be unable to properly prepare their cases \n14 \nfrom Mexico, access or meaningfully communicate with attorneys, and access expert or other \n15 \n16  professional services necessary to make out their asylum claims. The grave danger and insecurity \n17  the Individual Plaintiffs face in Mexico will further undermine their ability to prepare for their cases \n18 \nand meaningfully access the asylum system. \n19 \n116.  The Individual Plaintiffs were not provided enough information about how to attend their \n20 \nimmigration court hearings in the United States when they were forced to return to Mexico.   \n21 \n117.  Several Individual Plaintiffs have friends or family members in the United States who had \n22 \noffered to help support them and find them an attorney. In Mexico, however, the Individual \n23 \n24  Plaintiffs do not have any family to help them through the legal process and they lack the financial \n25 \nresources to support themselves in Mexico for months or years.   \n26 \n118.  For example, Plaintiff Gregory Doe has a sister in the United States who had offered to help \n27 \nsupport him and obtain the resources he would need to apply for asylum. Gregory worries that, \n28 \n     \n21 \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807   Document 1   Filed 02/14/19   Page 23 of 41\n1  without assistance, he will not be able to gather the evidence necessary to prove his case, such as \n2 \nstatements from those who witnessed his persecution. Plaintiff Evan Doe similarly lacks support in \n3 \nMexico to help him prepare his case.  \n4 \n119.  Plaintiff Frank Doe does not know where he will stay while he prepares his asylum claim. \n5 \nAfter being forced to return to Mexico, he attempted to return to the shelter where he resided \n6 \npreviously, but officials turned him away because it was full. He was able to find a different shelter \n7 \n8  to stay for a couple of nights, but he does not have a more permanent residence. Plaintiff Ian Doe \n9  was also unable to return to the shelter where he stayed previously.  \n10 \nH.  The Organizational Plaintiffs Are Injured by Defendants’ Forced Return Policy \n11 \n120.  The Organizational Plaintiffs are nonprofit organizations that provide legal assistance to \n12 \nasylum seekers from Central America and other parts of the world, the majority of whom arrive \n13 \nthrough the southern border. Defendants’ policy of returning asylum seekers to Mexico frustrates \n14 \neach Organizational Plaintiff’s goals and requires them to expend resources they otherwise would \n15 \n16  spend in other ways. \n17  121.  Plaintiff Innovation Law Lab is a nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing the legal \n18 \nrights  of  immigrants  and  refugees  in  the  United  States,  with  a  focus  on  providing  legal \n19 \nrepresentation to asylum seekers. Among other programs and services, the Law Lab has established \n20 \nvarious “Centers of Excellence” around the country, which provide support to asylum seekers and \n21 \ntheir  pro  bono  attorneys,  including  legal,  technical,  and  strategic  assistance  in  preparing  and \n22 \npresenting  asylum  claims  in  removal  proceedings.  These  projects  are  established  in  Georgia, \n23 \n24  Kansas, Missouri, North Carolina, and Oregon, and the Law Lab is in the process of expanding to \n25 \nsites in Texas, New Mexico, and California. An important component of the Law Lab’s mission is \n26 \nthe  investment  in  technology  resources  to  support  its  work.  The  Law  Lab  employs  software \n27 \n28 \n     \n22 \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807   Document 1   Filed 02/14/19   Page 24 of 41\n1  engineers to maintain its technology and create software deployments that support its representation \n2 \nmodels across the United States. \n3 \n122.  Defendants’ new forced return policy frustrates Law Lab’s efforts to obtain asylum and \n4 \nother relief for asylum seekers, and has required and will continue to require the Law Lab to divert \n5 \nsignificantly its limited resources to counteract this frustration. For example, because the policy \n6 \nmakes it more difficult for asylum seekers to obtain legal representation and to successfully pursue \n7 \n8  their claims, it threatens to hinder Law Lab’s ability to provide its core services. The attorneys and \n9  staff who manage those projects, have had to shift their organizational focus, time, resources to \n10 \nMexico and away, from critical, ongoing matters and clients served by their existing projects. This \n11 \nsignificant  diversion  of  the  Law  Lab’s  resources,  which  has  been  necessary  to  counter  the \n12 \nfrustration of their mission and meet the needs of individuals returned to Mexico, vastly diminishes \n13 \nthe  organization’s  operational  capacity.  Moreover,  the  process  of  deploying  the  Law  Lab’s \n14 \nimmigration case technology in a new, remote location has been particularly complicated and will \n15 \n16  require additional investment of resources. \n17  123.    The  new  policy  has  also  required  Law  Lab  to  rework  the  orientation,  training,  and \n18 \nresources that it provides to asylum-seeking clients to address the needs of individuals returned to \n19 \nMexico.  Overhauling  these  materials  is  especially  challenging  in  light  of  the  unprecedented \n20 \ncircumstances surrounding the new policy. For example, it is unclear how individuals who have \n21 \nbeen returned to Mexico will present their cases and at what time; how they will attend their court \n22 \nhearings; or how, if they are able to obtain counsel, they will exchange documents or information \n23 \n24  with  their  attorneys  in  the  United  States.  This  uncertainty  also  significantly  undermines  the \n25 \neffectiveness of the Law Lab’s goal to provide effective representation and help asylum seekers \n26 \nsuccessfully pursue relief. \n27 \n28 \n     \n23 \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807   Document 1   Filed 02/14/19   Page 25 of 41\n1  124.  The new policy also frustrates the Law Lab’s mission and organizational model because, by \n2 \nreturning  asylum-seekers  to  Mexico,  fewer  pro  bono  attorneys  will  be  able  to  provide \n3 \nrepresentation. Most of the pro bono attorneys within the Law Lab’s existing network do not have \n4 \nthe  time,  skill,  or  capacity  to  engage  in  representation  for  individuals  stranded  in  Mexico, \n5 \nparticularly because the organization’s model requires that attorneys provide a substantial portion of \n6 \nrepresentation through in-person, face-to-face interactions. In this way, the policy undermines the \n7 \n8  Law Lab’s ability to provide a core service: engaging and supporting pro bono attorneys to provide \n9  direct representation to asylum seekers. \n10 \n125.   Plaintiff CARECEN of Northern California provides immigration legal and social services \n11 \nto clients throughout the San Francisco Bay Area and elsewhere in California. A central part of the \n12 \norganization’s mission is to provide high-quality legal counseling, representation, and wrap-around \n13 \nsocial services, such as case management, mental health therapy, and peer education, to asylum \n14 \nseekers.    \n15 \n16  126.  CARECEN appears on the list of legal services providers that the federal government has \n17  distributed to migrants returned to Mexico. The organization has been retained to represent an \n18 \nasylum seeker returned to Mexico under the policy. Because CARECEN provides a consultation to \n19 \nevery person who seeks its assistance, it anticipates serving additional returned individuals in the \n20 \nfuture. \n21 \n127.  Due  to  the  numerous  significant  obstacles  to  providing  high-quality  legal  and  social \n22 \nservices to asylum seekers returned to Mexico, the new policy frustrates CARECEN’s mission of \n23 \n24  providing  such  services  and  accordingly  requires  the  organization  to  divert  significant \n25 \norganizational resources in response, as CARECEN’s legal program is neither structured nor \n26 \nenvisioned to represent asylum clients residing in Mexico. The policy also makes it more difficult \n27 \nfor CARECEN’s potential clients, who will be stuck in Mexico pursuant to the policy, to gain \n28 \n     \n24 \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807   Document 1   Filed 02/14/19   Page 26 of 41\n1  access to and participate in the organization’s core services, thereby impairing CARECEN’s ability \n2 \nto function. \n3 \n128.  For example, CARECEN will not be able to effectively present the claims for protection of \n4 \nreturned asylum seekers because the organization will be unable to provide to clients in Mexico the \n5 \nsame critical legal and social service support needed to assist survivors of trauma that it provides \n6 \nto clients in the United States. Because serving individuals in Mexico will be much more resource \n7 \n8  intensive, CARECEN will be forced to divert significant resources away from its core services for \n9  asylum seekers in the United States to attempt to serve clients while they are in Mexico, or \n10 \nsubstantially cut or curtail its current asylum practice, which undermines its organizational goals.   \n11 \n129.    CARECEN  also  will  be  forced  to  expend  significant  resources  to  change  its  intake, \n12 \nconsultation, and representation model, all of which are currently predicated on in-person services, \n13 \nand bear the significant costs of frequent travel to Mexico and San Diego. Representing asylum \n14 \nseekers  returned  to  Mexico  will  require  CARECEN  to  restructure  attorney  caseloads  and \n15 \n16  responsibilities, and divert staff time and other resources from other cases. If the policy remains in \n17  effect, CARECEN will be able to handle far fewer cases every year, and its ability to provide \n18 \nmental  health  and  other  supportive  services  will  be  severely  compromised.  In  addition, \n19 \nCARECEN’s asylum representation program is funded by grants from the State of California and \n20 \nvarious local governments that require the clients served to live or have previously resided in the \n21 \njurisdiction. Accordingly, taking on asylum cases under the policy will require the organization to \n22 \ndivert funding from its general operating budget and so will undermine its ability to maintain its \n23 \n24  various legal and social service programs. Also, because of the policy, the number of potential \n25 \nclients who can satisfy the residency requirements of CARECEN’s funders will decline, thus \n26 \njeopardizing CARECEN’s ability to secure these grants moving forward. \n27 \n28 \n     \n25 \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807   Document 1   Filed 02/14/19   Page 27 of 41\n1  130.  Plaintiff Centro Legal de la Raza (“Centro Legal”) is a comprehensive immigration legal \n2 \nservices agency that provides legal consultations, limited-scope services, full representation, and \n3 \nlegal referrals to over 10,000 clients annually. As part of its services, Centro Legal provides direct \n4 \nlegal  representation  to  asylum  seekers  throughout  California,  including  those  in  removal \n5 \nproceedings. \n6 \n131.  Centro Legal is included on the list of free legal services providers provided by the U.S. \n7 \n8  government to asylum seekers who are returned to Mexico. It is in the process of being retained by \n9  three individuals who were forced to return to Mexico. \n10 \n132.  Defendants’ policy will frustrate Centro Legal’s core mission of providing comprehensive \n11 \nand effective legal representation to asylum seekers. For example, the resource-intensive nature of \n12 \nassisting  asylum  seekers  located  in  Mexico  will  cause  Centro  Legal  to  have  fewer  resources \n13 \navailable to continue its existing program and case work. The new policy will also frustrate Centro \n14 \nLegal’s mission of providing a high volume of comprehensive removal defense services to asylum \n15 \n16  seekers because it will be nearly impossible for the organization to provide comprehensive services \n17  to individuals in Mexico. Centro Legal’s ability to provide effective representation to asylum \n18 \nseekers subjected to the forced return policy will also be hampered due to the numerous obstacles to \n19 \ncounsel access and case preparation in Mexico. The effective and ethical representation of clients in \n20 \nMexico will require Centro Legal to either hire substantial additional staff or significantly lower the \n21 \nnumber of cases of asylum seekers in the United States that it accepts. Moreover, Centro Legal will \n22 \nhave to use significant resources to research or hire counsel to advise on the requirements under \n23 \n24  both U.S. and Mexican law for its attorneys to practice in Mexico.   \n25 \n133.  Further, the policy makes it more difficult for Centro Legal’s potential clients, who will be \n26 \nstuck in Mexico pursuant to the policy, to gain access to and participate in the organization’s core \n27 \nservices, thereby impairing Centro Legal’s ability to function. \n28 \n     \n26 \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807   Document 1   Filed 02/14/19   Page 28 of 41\n1  134.  Plaintiff the Immigration and Deportation Defense Clinic of the University of San Francisco \n2 \nSchool of Law (“USF Clinic”) provides removal defense and engages in advocacy on behalf of \n3 \nasylum seekers in California. The USF Clinic was established in 2015 in direct response to the \n4 \nincrease in individuals fleeing violence in Central America and Mexico and seeking asylum and \n5 \nother relief in the United States. Since that time, 87% of the USF Clinic’s clients have come from \n6 \nthe Northern Triangle countries and entered the United States through the southern border. A \n7 \n8  central aim of the USF Clinic is to train USF law students to be effective and ethical immigration \n9  practitioners in the area of asylum law, and specifically in removal defense. \n10 \n135.    Defendants’ policy of returning certain asylum seekers to Mexico threatens and frustrates \n11 \nthe USF Clinic’s mission and will require it to divert resources away from its core services. For \n12 \nexample, as greater numbers of asylum seekers are forced to return to Mexico, the policy will make \n13 \nit more difficult for the USF Clinic to connect with potential clients, who are typically referred to \n14 \nthe clinic through other legal service organizations in Northern California. Indeed, in response to \n15 \n16  the new policy, the USF Clinic has already had to make arrangements to send a team of eleven \n17  students and supervisors to the southern border to assist individuals subject to Defendants’ policy. \n18 \nAs the forced return policy is expanded, in order to serve sufficient clients to train its students, the \n19 \nUSF Clinic will have to shift its model to focus on representing asylum seekers who are stranded in \n20 \nMexico, forcing it to seek out new sources of funding, rearrange the way that it provides legal \n21 \nservices, and divert significant funds to travel and communications costs.   \n22 \n136.  The USF Clinic’s asylum representation work is currently entirely funded by grants from \n23 \n24  the State of California and local governments that require the clients to be physically present in \n25 \nCalifornia. As Defendants’ policy expands, the Clinic thus risks losing its existing funding, which \n26 \ncould lead to a reduction or termination of their program. Representing asylum seekers in Mexico \n27 \n28 \n     \n27 \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807   Document 1   Filed 02/14/19   Page 29 of 41\n1  would also pose significant obstacles and be more resource intensive, requiring extensive travel and \n2 \nother changes to current practice to provide adequate representation. \n3 \n137.    Defendants’ policy will also significantly harm the USF Clinic’s core mission of training \n4 \nlaw students to be effective advocates. The USF Clinic requires in-person access to its clients in \n5 \norder to effectively train law students consistent with its mission. However, law students lack the \n6 \nnecessary flexibility in their schedules to travel repeatedly to San Diego for court hearings and \n7 \n8  Mexico  for  the  multiple,  lengthy  client  meetings  typically  required  to  prepare  for  an  asylum \n9  hearing. Shifting the organization’s representation model to provide services to clients at a distance \n10 \nwould be extremely difficult and compromise the Clinic’s ability to effectively represent clients and \n11 \ntrain law students. \n12 \n138.  Plaintiff Al Otro Lado is a nonprofit organization based in Los Angeles that provides legal \n13 \nrepresentation or other assistance to individuals in asylum and other immigration proceedings in \n14 \nSouthern California. The organization also provides know-your-rights workshops and other services \n15 \n16  to asylum seekers in Tijuana, Mexico. \n17  139.  With its policy of returning asylum seekers, Defendants have frustrated Al Otro Lado’s \n18 \nmission  and  have  forced  the  organization  to  divert  significant  resources  away  from  its  other \n19 \nprograms. For example, the organization’s small staff has had to pull its attention from integral \n20 \nprojects to identify and respond to the urgent needs of asylum seekers stranded in Mexico. Since \n21 \nDefendants’ implementation of the new policy, Al Otro Lado has experienced a significant increase \n22 \nin requests for assistance from individuals who have been returned to Mexico, many of whom do \n23 \n24  not understand what has happened to them or why they have been returned. Staff or volunteers must \n25 \ntake time away from other critical tasks to review individuals’ documents, answer questions, and \n26 \nattempt to place them with pro bono attorneys. The new policy has also required Al Otro Lado to \n27 \n28 \n     \n28 \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807   Document 1   Filed 02/14/19   Page 30 of 41\n1  re-work  its  volunteer  training  and  know-your-rights  presentations  and  overhaul  its  training \n2 \nmaterials to incorporate new and critical information. \n3 \n140.    Al Otro Lado has also been forced to divert significant staff resources to help returned \n4 \nmigrants find safe housing in Mexico and provide emotional support. Because many returned \n5 \nasylum seekers will be unable to retain legal counsel from Mexico, Al Otro Lado has had to begin \n6 \ndeveloping workshops to provide pro se support to those who need assistance completing the \n7 \n8  English-only asylum application form, which will require significant staff efforts. Providing pro se \n9  trainings will also pull volunteer resources away from outreach efforts and general know-your-\n10 \nrights workshops. \n11 \n141.  Plaintiff the Tahirih Justice Center (“Tahirih”) is a nonprofit and non-partisan organization \n12 \nproviding free legal immigration services to survivors of gender-based violence such as domestic \n13 \nabuse, sexual violence, and human trafficking. Tahirih’s mission is to provide free holistic services \n14 \nto immigrant women and girls fleeing violence such as rape, domestic violence, female genital \n15 \n16  mutilation/cutting, forced marriage, and human trafficking, and who seek legal immigration status \n17  under U.S. law. Tahirih offers legal representation and social services for individuals who seek \n18 \nprotection, including asylum, in their immigration proceedings. An average of 78% of Tahirih \n19 \nclients in the past few years were Latin American survivors of violence, virtually all of whom \n20 \nwould have crossed at Tijuana or other ports of entry along the southern border.  \n21 \n142.  Defendants’  policy  will  frustrate  Tahirih’s  mission  and  require  it  to  divert  significant \n22 \norganizational resources to address the consequences of the policy. Tahirih will not be able to \n23 \n24  effectively provide holistic legal services to the asylum seekers fleeing gender-based violence who \n25 \nare returned to Mexico and will be forced to divert significant resources from its existing services to \n26 \nattempt to serve those clients. Asylum seekers returned to Mexico will have little to no practical \n27 \nway to learn that Tahirih exists or that it offers holistic assistance. Tahirih will have to send staff to \n28 \n     \n29 \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807   Document 1   Filed 02/14/19   Page 31 of 41\n1  Mexico  to  conduct  intakes  and  to  effectively  represent  to  these  asylum  seekers.  This  will \n2 \nsignificantly increate the time and cost Tahirih spends to develop cases, as working with survivors \n3 \nof gender-based violence, who are typically traumatized, requires repeated face-to-face meetings \n4 \nand consultations. Furthermore, Tahirih will be required to spend additional time and money to \n5 \nrepresent  individuals  returned  to  Mexico  whose  cases  have  been  assigned  to  the  San  Diego \n6 \nImmigration Court. \n7 \n8  143.  Tahirih will have to divert substantial resources to researching and understanding Mexican \n9  law regarding the practice of law by foreign lawyers, including complicated questions of licensing, \n10 \nreciprocity, the effect of NAFTA, any criminal penalties and visa requirements, and how all of \n11 \nthose issues interact with lawyers’ professional obligations in each state in which a Tahirih attorney \n12 \nor one of its hundreds of pro bono attorneys is barred. The risk of potential legal sanctions may \n13 \ndeter attorneys from taking on asylum seekers returned to Mexico, thereby frustrating Tahirih’s \n14 \nmission. \n15 \n16  144.  Tahirih  will  also  be  unable  to  obtain  the  expert  services,  including  psychological \n17  evaluations,  that  are  necessary  to  represent  many  survivors  of  gender-based  violence.  Tahirih \n18 \nanticipates needing to transport experts to Mexico for psychological evaluations, again requiring a \n19 \nsubstantial diversion of time and funds for that travel. In addition, Tahirih will be required to divert \n20 \nresources to understanding Mexican laws relating to licensing and the practice of psychology by a \n21 \nforeigner in Mexico.  \n22 \n145.  Finally, Defendants’ new policy will jeopardize Tahirih’s funding streams. Tahirih’s San \n23 \n24  Francisco  office  receives  grant  funding  from  Santa  Clara  County,  California  to  provide \n25 \nimmigration-related legal services to vulnerable individuals who reside in or are employed in Santa \n26 \nClara County. Under Defendants’ policy, fewer individuals will be permitted to enter the United \n27 \n28 \n     \n30 \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807   Document 1   Filed 02/14/19   Page 32 of 41\n1  States pending their removal proceedings, meaning there will be fewer potential clients for Tahirih \n2 \nto serve in Santa Clara County.     \n3 \n146.  The  Organizational  Plaintiffs  have  also  been  harmed  because  they  were  denied  the \n4 \nopportunity  to  comment  on  Defendants’  policy  through  a  notice-and-comment  rulemaking.  If \n5 \nDefendants  had  provided  an  opportunity  for  notice  and  comment  before  Defendant  began \n6 \nimplementing the policy, Plaintiffs could have informed Defendants of their serious objections to \n7 \n8  the policy, and they may have convinced Defendants to adopt a different approach. \n9   \n10 \nCAUSES OF ACTION \n \n11 \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n12   \n(VIOLATION OF INA § 235(b)(2)(C), 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(2)(C),  \n13  TREATMENT OF ALIENS ARRIVING FROM FOREIGN CONTIGUOUS TERRITORY, \nAND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)) \n14 \n \n147.  The foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n15 \n16  148.  INA § 235(b)(2)(C), 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(2)(C) permits the return to a contiguous territory \n17  only of an “alien described in subparagraph (A) who is arriving on land (whether or not at a \n18 \ndesignated port of arrival) from a foreign territory contiguous to the United States.” Id. Section \n19 \n1225(b)(2)(B) further provides that the return authorized in Section 1225(b)(2)(C) shall not be \n20 \napplied to any noncitizen “to whom paragraph (1) [Section 1225(b)(1) expedited removal] applies.” \n21 \n8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(2)(B)(ii). \n22 \n149.  In addition, Section 1225(b)(2)(C) authorizes return only of those individuals who are \n23 \n24  “from” the foreign contiguous territory, and only where return would not violate the United \n25 \nStates’ protection obligations under domestic and international law, including the prohibition on \n26 \nreturning individuals to face persecution, torture, or cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment; \n27 \n28 \n     \n31 \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807   Document 1   Filed 02/14/19   Page 33 of 41\n1  the right to a meaningful opportunity to apply for asylum; and other restrictions on countries to \n2 \nwhich a noncitizen may be removed or returned. \n3 \n150.  Defendants are applying their policy of returning asylum seekers to Mexico (the “forced \n4 \nreturn policy”) to individuals, including the individual Plaintiffs, who cannot lawfully be \n5 \nreturned under Section 1225(b)(2)(C). \n6 \n151.  As a result, the forced return policy is contrary to law. See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n7 \n8    SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \n9  (VIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT,  \n5 U.S.C. § 553(b), (c), (d)) \n10 \n \n152.  The Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) requires notice and opportunity for comment \n11 \n12  prior to the promulgation of a rule. 5 U.S.C. § 553(b), (c).  \n13  153.  Defendants’ nondiscretionary procedure for determining whether an individual who is more \n14 \nlikely than not to face persecution or torture in Mexico, and thus precluded from being returned \n15 \nto Mexico during the pendency of removal proceedings, constitutes a legislative rule that \n16 \nrequires notice-and-comment rulemaking. \n17 \n154.  Defendants did not promulgate a rule or engage in notice-and-comment rulemaking before \n18 \nimplementing their procedure for making fear determinations as part of the forced return policy. \n19 \n20  155.  The APA requires that a substantive rule be published “no less than 30 days before its \n21  effective date.” 5 U.S.C. § 553(d).   \n22 \n156.  Defendants failed to appropriately publish the forced return policy, its screening procedures, \n23 \nand related guidance 30 days before its effective date.   \n24 \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n25 \n \n(VIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT,  \n26 \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)) \n \n27 \n157.  The foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully set forth herein. \n28 \n     \n32 \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807   Document 1   Filed 02/14/19   Page 34 of 41\n1  158.  The APA provides that courts “shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is \n2 \n“arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 \n3 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n4 \n159.   Defendants’ forced return policy is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. Defendants \n5 \nhave not articulated a reasoned explanation for their decision to adopt this policy; failed to \n6 \nconsider relevant factors; relied on factors Congress did not intend to be considered; and offered \n7 \n8  explanations for their decision that are counter to the evidence before the agency. \n9  160.  The policy deprives asylum seekers of a meaningful right to apply for asylum. \n10 \n161.  The policy also permits an individual’s forced return to Mexico unless the individual \n11 \naffirmatively states a fear of return and establishes before an asylum officer that it is more likely \n12 \nthan not that he or she will face persecution or torture there, without providing basic procedural \n13 \nprotections, including: any notice that he or she must affirmatively express such a fear; any \n14 \nopportunity to consult with counsel either prior to or during the fear interview; the guarantee of \n15 \n16  an interpreter; a written summary of the interview and written explanation of the determination; \n17  or immigration judge review.  \n18 \n162.  The policy is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law because it departs from the agency’s \n19 \nexisting policies for determining whether individuals face a likelihood of persecution or torture, \n20 \nas well as prior policies prohibiting the return of individuals to contiguous territories pending \n21 \ntheir removal proceedings based on a fear of persecution or torture, without providing a \n22 \nreasoned explanation for departing from these policies. \n23 \n24  FOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \n25 \n(VIOLATION OF INA § 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3) \nWITHHOLDING OF REMOVAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT,  \n26 \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)) \n \n27 \n163.  The foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully set forth herein. \n28 \n     \n33 \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807   Document 1   Filed 02/14/19   Page 35 of 41\n1  164.  The 1951 Refugee Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees, to \n2 \nwhich the United States is party, requires that the United States not “expel or return (‘refouler’) a \n3 \nrefugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be \n4 \nthreatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or \n5 \npolitical opinion.” United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, art. 33, July 28, \n6 \n1951, 189 U.N.T.S. 150; see also Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, Jan. 31, 1967, 19 \n7 \n8  U.S.T. 6223, 606 U.N.T.S. 267. \n9  165.  The Refugee Convention prohibits the return of individuals to countries where they would \n10 \ndirectly face persecution on a protected ground as well as to countries that would deport them to \n11 \nconditions of persecution.  \n12 \n166.  Congress has codified these prohibitions in the “withholding of removal” provision at INA § \n13 \n241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), which bars the removal of an individual to a country where it is \n14 \nmore likely than not that he or she would face persecution.  \n15 \n16  167.  Pursuant to regulation, only an immigration judge can determine whether an individual \n17  faces such a risk of persecution and is entitled to withholding of removal after full removal \n18 \nproceedings in immigration court. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(a). \n19 \n168.  The forced return policy provides none of these safeguards to ensure the critical protection \n20 \nagainst nonrefoulement and therefore violates Section 1231(b)(3). It permits an asylum officer to \n21 \ndetermine whether it is more likely than not that an individual faces persecution in Mexico through \n22 \na truncated procedure, without any right to review or a hearing before an immigration judge. \n23 \n24  Moreover, the procedure does not assess whether an individual is at risk of refoulement to his or her \n25 \ncountry of origin by Mexico, and does not account for whether an individual will be able to exercise \n26 \nhis or her right to apply for asylum from Mexico. \n27 \n169.  This procedure violates Section 1231(b)(3) and its implementing regulations. \n28 \n     \n34 \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807   Document 1   Filed 02/14/19   Page 36 of 41\n1  170.  As a result, the forced return policy is contrary to law. See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n2   FIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \n3  (VIOLATION OF CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL LAW:  \nPROHIBITION ON REFOULEMENT) \n4   \n171.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth herein.  \n5 \n172.  The prohibition on refoulement is a specific, universal, and obligatory norm of customary \n6 \n7  international law. That norm prohibits returning an individual to a country where there exists a \n8  threat of subsequent forcible return to a country where the individual would be subject to torture or \n9 \nwhere the individual’s life or freedom would be threatened on account of their race, religion, \n10 \nnationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion.   \n11 \n173.  Defendants have not undertaken a proper evaluation of the risk of refoulement by Mexico. \n12 \nThe procedures for carrying out the forced return policy are inadequate to guard against such \n13 \nindirect refoulement in violation of the law of nations.  \n14 \n15  174.  Defendants were aware or reasonably should have known that indirect refoulement by \n16 \nMexico was a foreseeable consequence of its forced return policy. \n17 \n175.  Defendants knowingly and purposefully designed and, directly or through their agents, \n18 \napplied their forced return policy to the individual Plaintiffs.  \n19 \n176.  Defendants’ actions have placed the individual Plaintiffs at risk of return to their countries \n20 \nof origin, where their lives or freedom would be threatened on account of their race, religion, \n21 \n22  nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, or where they face a \n23  substantial risk of torture or other cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment. \n24 \n177.  Defendants’ actions have caused and will continue to cause a grave and foreseeable injury to \n25 \nPlaintiffs, including a continued risk of refoulement in violation of the protections afforded to them \n26 \nunder international law. \n27 \n28 \n     \n35 \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807   Document 1   Filed 02/14/19   Page 37 of 41\n1  178.  Plaintiffs do not have an adequate damages remedy at law to address the violations alleged \n2 \nherein.   \n3 \nSIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \n4 \n(VIOLATION OF INA § 208(a), 8 U.S.C. § 1108(a), ASYLUM, AND ADMINISTRATIVE \n5  PROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)) \n \n6 \n179.  The foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully set forth herein. \n7 \n180.  The INA provides, with certain exceptions, that “[a]ny alien who is physically present in the \n8 \nUnited States or who arrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated port of arrival and \n9 \nincluding an alien who is brought to the United States after having been interdicted in international \n10 \nor United States waters), irrespective of such alien’s status, may apply for asylum in accordance \n11 \n12  with this section or, where applicable, section 1225(b) of this title.” 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1).  \n13  181.  The forced return policy is contrary to law, see 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), under 8 U.S.C. \n14 \n§ 1158(a)(1), because individuals are returned to conditions that meaningfully deprive them of their \n15 \nright to apply for asylum.  \n16 \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n17 \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray this Court to: \n18 \na.  Declare unlawful the new forced return policy (or “Migrant Protection Protocols”), \n19 \n20  including the Secretary’s January 25, 2019 Memorandum, the USCIS Policy Guidance, and the \n21  CBP MPP Guiding Principles, Commissioner’s Memorandum Implementing the MPP, and Field \n22 \nOperations Memorandum Implementing the MPP; \n23 \nb.  Enter an order vacating the forced return policy; \n24 \nc.  Enter an order enjoining Defendants from continuing to apply the forced return policy to \n25 \nthird-party nationals seeking humanitarian protection at a port of entry or between ports of entry; \n26 \n27 \n28 \n     \n36 \n  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807   Document 1   Filed 02/14/19   Page 38 of 41\n1  d.  Enter an order providing relief for the Individual Plaintiffs by ordering that Defendants \n2 \nreturn them to the San Ysidro Port of Entry for reprocessing of their applications for admission \n3 \nwithout subjecting them to the unlawful forced return policy; \n4 \ne.  Award Plaintiffs’ counsel reasonable attorneys’ fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act, \n5 \nand any other applicable statute or regulation; and, \n6 \nf.

FLETCHER, and WATFORD, Circuit Judges. \n \nPER CURIAM: \nIn January 2019, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued the \nMigrant Protection Protocols (MPP), which initiated a new inspection policy along \nthe southern border.  Before the MPP, immigration officers would typically \nprocess asylum applicants who lack valid entry documentation for expedited \nremoval.  If the applicant passed a credible fear screening, DHS would either \ndetain or parole the individual until her asylum claim could be heard before an \nimmigration judge.  The MPP now directs the “return” of asylum applicants who \narrive from Mexico as a substitute to the traditional options of detention and \nparole.  Under the MPP, these applicants are processed for standard removal \nproceedings, instead of expedited removal.  They are then made to wait in Mexico \nuntil an immigration judge resolves their asylum claims.  Immigration officers \nexercise discretion in returning the applicants they inspect, but the MPP is \ncategorically inapplicable to unaccompanied minors, Mexican nationals, applicants \n\n  CCaassee:  139:1-195-c7v1-60,0 0850/70-7R/S20  1 D9o, cIDu:m 1e1n2t8 8939  8 F7,il eDdk t0E5n/1tr6y:/ 1292 -  1P, aPgaeg 3e  o3f  o1f1 11\nPage 3 of 11 \nwho are processed for expedited removal, and any applicant “who is more likely \nthan not to face persecution or torture in Mexico.” \nEleven Central American asylum applicants who were returned to Tijuana, \nMexico, and six organizations that provide asylum-related legal services \nchallenged the MPP on several grounds in the district court.  After concluding that \nthe MPP lacks a statutory basis and violates the Administrative Procedure Act \n(APA), the district court enjoined DHS on a nationwide basis “from continuing to \nimplement or expand the [MPP].” \nDHS has moved for a stay of the preliminary injunction pending its appeal to \nthis court.  Our equitable discretion in ruling on a stay motion is guided by four \nfactors: “(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely \nto succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured \nabsent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other \nparties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.”  Nken v. \nHolder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).  We begin \nwith a discussion of the first factor, which turns largely on the plaintiffs’ likelihood \nof success on their claim that the MPP lacks statutory authorization. \nI \nSome background is in order before addressing the merits of the plaintiffs’ \nstatutory claim.  Congress has established an exhaustive inspection regime for all \n\n  CCaassee:  139:1-195-c7v1-60,0 0850/70-7R/S20  1 D9o, cIDu:m 1e1n2t8 8939  8 F7,il eDdk t0E5n/1tr6y:/ 1292 -  1P, aPgaeg 4e  o4f  o1f1 11\nPage 4 of 11 \nnon-citizens who seek admission into the United States.  See 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1225(a)(3).  Applicants for admission are processed either through expedited \nremoval proceedings or through regular removal proceedings.  Section 1225(b)(1) \noutlines the procedures for expedited removal and specifies the class of non-\ncitizens who are eligible for expedited removal: \nIf an immigration officer determines that an alien (other \nthan an alien described in subparagraph (F)) who is \narriving in the United States or is described in clause (iii) \nis inadmissible under section 1182(a)(6)(C) or 1182(a)(7) \nof this title, the officer shall order the alien removed from \nthe United States without further hearing or review \nunless the alien indicates either an intention to apply for \nasylum under section 1158 of this title or a fear of \npersecution. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(A)(i).  Simply put, an applicant is eligible for expedited removal only \nif the immigration officer determines that the individual is inadmissible on one of \ntwo grounds: fraud or misrepresentation (§ 1182(a)(6)(C)) or lack of \ndocumentation (§ 1182(a)(7)). \nAll applicants for admission who are not processed for expedited removal \nare placed in regular removal proceedings under § 1225(b)(2)(A).  That process \ngenerally entails a hearing before an immigration judge pursuant to § 1229a.  \nSection 1225(b)(2)(B) provides exceptions to § 1225(b)(2)(A), while \n§ 1225(b)(2)(C) permits applicants processed under § 1225(b)(2)(A) to be returned \n\n  CCaassee:  139:1-195-c7v1-60,0 0850/70-7R/S20  1 D9o, cIDu:m 1e1n2t8 8939  8 F7,il eDdk t0E5n/1tr6y:/ 1292 -  1P, aPgaeg 5e  o5f  o1f1 11\nPage 5 of 11 \nto the contiguous territory from which they arrived for the duration of their \nremoval proceedings.  Section 1225(b)(2) provides in full: \n(A) In general \n     Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), in the case of \nan alien who is an applicant for admission, if the \nexamining immigration officer determines that an alien \nseeking admission is not clearly and beyond a doubt \nentitled to be admitted, the alien shall be detained for a \nproceeding under section 1229a of this title. \n(B) Exception \n     Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to an alien— \n(i) who is a crewman, \n(ii) to whom paragraph (1) applies, or \n(iii) who is a stowaway. \n(C) Treatment of aliens arriving from contiguous \nterritory \n     In the case of an alien described in subparagraph (A) \nwho is arriving on land (whether or not at a designated \nport of arrival) from a foreign territory contiguous to the \nUnited States, the Attorney General may return the alien \nto that territory pending a proceeding under section 1229a \nof this title. \nDHS relies on the contiguous-territory provision in subsection (b)(2)(C) as \nthe statutory basis for the MPP.  That provision authorizes DHS to return “alien[s] \ndescribed in subparagraph (A)” to Mexico or Canada.  § 1225(b)(2)(C).  The \nphrase “described in” refers to the “salient identifying features” of the individuals \nsubject to this provision.  Nielsen v. Preap, 139 S. Ct. 954, 965 (2019) (emphasis \nand internal quotation marks omitted).  Because the plaintiffs in this case are not \n\n  CCaassee:  139:1-195-c7v1-60,0 0850/70-7R/S20  1 D9o, cIDu:m 1e1n2t8 8939  8 F7,il eDdk t0E5n/1tr6y:/ 1292 -  1P, aPgaeg 6e  o6f  o1f1 11\nPage 6 of 11 \n“clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted,” they fit the description in \n§ 1225(b)(2)(A) and thus seem to fall within the sweep of § 1225(b)(2)(C). \nAs the district court interpreted the statute, however, the contiguous-territory \nprovision may not be applied to applicants for admission who could have been \nplaced in expedited removal under § 1225(b)(1), even if they were placed in \nregular removal proceedings.  The crux of this argument is § 1225(b)(2)(B)(ii), \nwhich provides that “[s]ubparagraph (A) shall not apply to an alien . . . to whom \nparagraph (1) applies.”  So long as the applicant is eligible for expedited removal, \nthe district court reasoned, § 1225(b)(1) “applies” to that individual.  On this \naccount, it is immaterial that the plaintiffs were not in fact processed for expedited \nremoval during their inspection at the border. \nThe primary interpretive question presented by this stay motion is \nstraightforward:  Does § 1225(b)(1) “apply” to everyone who is eligible for \nexpedited removal, or only to those actually processed for expedited removal?  \nThe interpretive difficulty arises mainly because the inadmissibility grounds \ncontained in subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2) overlap.  A subset of applicants for \nadmission—those inadmissible due to fraud or misrepresentation, § 1182(a)(6)(C), \nand those who do not possess a valid entry document, § 1182(a)(7)—may be \nplaced in expedited removal.  § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i).  But as we read the statute, \nanyone who is “not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted” can be \n\n  CCaassee:  139:1-195-c7v1-60,0 0850/70-7R/S20  1 D9o, cIDu:m 1e1n2t8 8939  8 F7,il eDdk t0E5n/1tr6y:/ 1292 -  1P, aPgaeg 7e  o7f  o1f1 11\nPage 7 of 11 \nprocessed under § 1225(b)(2)(A).  Section 1225(b)(2)(A) is thus a “catchall” \nprovision in the literal sense, and Congress’ creation of expedited removal did not \nimpliedly preclude the use of § 1229a removal proceedings for those who could \notherwise have been placed in the more streamlined expedited removal process.  \nSee Matter of E-R-M- & L-R-M-, 25 I. & N. Dec. 520, 522–24 (BIA 2011). \nBecause the eligibility criteria for subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2) overlap, we \ncan tell which subsection “applies” to an applicant only by virtue of the processing \ndecision made during the inspection process.  Take first the procedures for \ndesignating an applicant for expedited removal.  When the immigration officer \n“determines” that the applicant “is inadmissible” under § 1182(a)(6)(C) or (a)(7), \nhe “shall order the alien removed from the United States without further hearing” \nunless the applicant requests asylum or expresses a fear of persecution, in which \ncase the officer “shall refer the alien for an interview by an asylum officer under \nsubparagraph (B).”  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i)–(ii).  In other words, the officer \ndecides inadmissibility on the spot without sending the matter to an immigration \njudge.  DHS’s regulations further explain that a § 1225(b)(1) determination entails \neither the issuance of a Notice and Order of Expedited Removal or the referral of \nthe applicant for a credible fear screening.  8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(2)(i), (4); see also \nid. § 208.30.  And to “remove any doubt” on the issue, § 1225(b)(2)(B) clarifies \n\n  CCaassee:  139:1-195-c7v1-60,0 0850/70-7R/S20  1 D9o, cIDu:m 1e1n2t8 8939  8 F7,il eDdk t0E5n/1tr6y:/ 1292 -  1P, aPgaeg 8e  o8f  o1f1 11\nPage 8 of 11 \nthat applicants processed in this manner are not entitled to a proceeding under \n§ 1229a.  Ali v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 552 U.S. 214, 226 (2008). \nIn contrast, § 1225(b)(2) is triggered “if the examining immigration officer \ndetermines that an alien seeking admission is not clearly and beyond a doubt \nentitled to be admitted.”  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(2)(A).  Following this determination, \nthe officer will issue a Notice to Appear, which is the first step in a § 1229a \nproceeding.  8 C.F.R. § 235.6(a)(1)(i); see also id. § 208.2(b).  A Notice to Appear \ncan charge inadmissibility on any ground, including the two that render an \nindividual eligible for expedited removal.  8 U.S.C. § 1229a(a)(2).  The officer \nthen sets a date for a hearing on the issue before an immigration judge.  See \nPereira v. Sessions, 138 S. Ct. 2105, 2111 (2018). \nThe plaintiffs were not processed under § 1225(b)(1).  We are doubtful that \nsubsection (b)(1) “applies” to them merely because subsection (b)(1) could have \nbeen applied.  And we think that Congress’ purpose was to make return to a \ncontiguous territory available during the pendency of § 1229a removal \nproceedings, as opposed to being contingent on any particular inadmissibility \nground.  Indeed, Congress likely believed that the contiguous-territory provision \nwould be altogether unnecessary if an applicant had already been processed for \nexpedited removal.  The plaintiffs are properly subject to the contiguous-territory \nprovision because they were processed in accordance with § 1225(b)(2)(A). \n\n  CCaassee:  139:1-195-c7v1-60,0 0850/70-7R/S20  1 D9o, cIDu:m 1e1n2t8 8939  8 F7,il eDdk t0E5n/1tr6y:/ 1292 -  1P, aPgaeg 9e  o9f  o1f1 11\nPage 9 of 11 \nThough the plaintiffs contend otherwise, our approach is consistent with the \nsubsections’ headings.  Section 1225(b)(1) is titled “Inspection of aliens arriving in \nthe United States and certain other aliens who have not been admitted or paroled,” \nand § 1225(b)(2) is labeled “Inspection of other aliens.”  The plaintiffs interpret \n§ 1225(b) to create two mutually exclusive pre-inspection categories of applicants \nfor admission; as explained above, we read the statute to create two mutually \nexclusive post-inspection categories.  In our view, those who are not processed for \nexpedited removal under § 1225(b)(1) are the “other aliens” subject to the general \nrule of § 1225(b)(2). \nOur interpretation is also consistent with Jennings v. Rodriguez, 138 S. Ct. \n830 (2018), the principal authority on which the plaintiffs rely.  There, the \nSupreme Court explained that “applicants for admission fall into one of two \ncategories, those covered by § 1225(b)(1) and those covered by § 1225(b)(2).”  Id. \nat 837.  As the Court noted, “Section 1225(b)(1) applies to aliens initially \ndetermined to be inadmissible due to fraud, misrepresentation, or lack of valid \ndocumentation.”  Id. (emphasis added).  “Section 1225(b)(2) is broader,” since it \n“serves as a catchall provision that applies to all applicants for admission not \ncovered by § 1225(b)(1).”  Id.  We think our interpretation more closely matches \nthe Court’s understanding of the mechanics of § 1225(b), as it is attentive to the \n\n  CCaassee:  139:1-195-c7v1-060, 0850/70-7R/S20  1 D9o, cIDu:m 1e1n2t8 8939  8 F7,il eDdk t0E5n/1tr6y/:1 292  - 1P, aPgaeg 1e0 1 o0f  o1f1 11\nPage 10 of 11 \nrole of the immigration officer’s initial determination under § 1225(b)(1) and to \n§ 1225(b)(2)’s function as a catchall. \nFor the foregoing reasons, we conclude that DHS is likely to prevail on its \ncontention that § 1225(b)(1) “applies” only to applicants for admission who are \nprocessed under its provisions.  Under that reading of the statute, § 1225(b)(1) does \nnot apply to an applicant who is processed under § 1225(b)(2)(A), even if that \nindividual is rendered inadmissible by § 1182(a)(6)(C) or (a)(7).  As a result, \napplicants for admission who are placed in regular removal proceedings under \n§ 1225(b)(2)(A) may be returned to the contiguous territory from which they \narrived under § 1225(b)(2)(C). \nThe plaintiffs have advanced only one other claim that could justify a \nnationwide injunction halting the implementation of the MPP on a wholesale basis: \nthat the MPP should have gone through the APA’s notice-and-comment process.  \nDHS is likely to prevail on this claim as well, since “general statements of policy” \nare exempted from the notice-and-comment requirement.  5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(A).  \nThe MPP qualifies as a general statement of policy because immigration officers \ndesignate applicants for return on a discretionary case-by-case basis.  See Regents \nof the Univ. of Cal. v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 908 F.3d 476, 507 (9th Cir. \n2018); Mada-Luna v. Fitzpatrick, 813 F.2d 1006, 1013 (9th Cir. 1987). \n\n  CCaassee:  139:1-195-c7v1-060, 0850/70-7R/S20  1 D9o, cIDu:m 1e1n2t8 8939  8 F7,il eDdk t0E5n/1tr6y/:1 292  - 1P, aPgaeg 1e1 1 o1f  o1f1 11\nPage 11 of 11 \nII \nThe remaining factors governing issuance of a stay pending appeal weigh in \nthe government’s favor.  As to the second factor, DHS is likely to suffer \nirreparable harm absent a stay because the preliminary injunction takes off the \ntable one of the few congressionally authorized measures available to process the \napproximately 2,000 migrants who are currently arriving at the Nation’s southern \nborder on a daily basis.  See East Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, 909 F.3d \n1219, 1250–51 (9th Cir. 2018).  DHS has therefore made a strong showing on both \nthe first and second factors, which are the “most critical.”  Nken, 556 U.S. at 434. \nThe other two factors support the issuance of a stay as well.  The plaintiffs \nfear substantial injury upon return to Mexico, but the likelihood of harm is reduced \nsomewhat by the Mexican government’s commitment to honor its international-\nlaw obligations and to grant humanitarian status and work permits to individuals \nreturned under the MPP.  We are hesitant to disturb this compromise amid ongoing \ndiplomatic negotiations between the United States and Mexico because, as we have \nexplained, the preliminary injunction (at least in its present form) is unlikely to be \nsustained on appeal.  Finally, the public interest favors the “efficient administration \nof the immigration laws at the border.”  East Bay Sanctuary Covenant, 909 F.3d at \n1255 (quoting Landon v. Plasencia, 459 U.S. 21, 34 (1982)). \nThe motion for a stay pending appeal is GRANTED. ",

WOLF 3\nSUMMARY*\nImmigration /Preliminary Injunctions\nThe  panel  affirmed  the  district  court’s  grant  of  a\npreliminary injunction setting aside the Migrant Protection\nProtocols  (“MPP”),  under  which  non-Mexican  asylum\nseekers who present themselves at the southern border of the\nUnited States are required to wait in Mexico while their\nasylum applications are adjudicated.\nAfter  the  MPP  went  into  effect  in  January  2019,\nindividual and organizational plaintiffs sought an injunction,\narguing, inter alia, that the MPP is inconsistent with the\nImmigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), and that they have\na right to a remedy under the Administrative Procedure Act\n(“APA”).  The district court issued a preliminary injunction\nsetting aside the MPP.\nThe Government appealed and requested an emergency\nstay in this court pending appeal.  In three written opinions,\na motions panel unanimously granted the emergency stay.  In\na per curiam opinion, the motions panel disagreed, by a vote\nof two to one, with the district court’s holding that plaintiffs\nwere likely to succeed in their statutory argument that the\nMPP is inconsistent with 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b).  Judge Watford\nconcurred in that opinion, but wrote separately to express\nconcern that the MPP is arbitrary and capricious because it\nlacks sufficient non-refoulement protections.  Judge Fletcher\n* This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court.  It has\nbeen prepared by court staff for the convenience of the reader.\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 4 of 57\n4 INNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF\nconcurred only in the result, arguing that the MPP was\ninconsistent with 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b).\nThe current panel first noted that the individual plaintiffs,\nall of whom have been returned to Mexico under the MPP,\nobviously have standing.  The panel also concluded that the\norganizational plaintiffs have standing, noting their decreased\nability to carry out their core missions as well as diversion of\ntheir resources.\nAddressing the question of whether a merits panel is\nbound by the analysis of a motions panel on a question of\nlaw, the panel followed East Bay Sanctuary Covenant v.\nTrump, Nos. 18-17274 and 18-17436 (9th Cir. Feb. 28, 2020),\nargued on the same day as this case, in which the court held\nthat a motions panel’s legal analysis, performed during the\ncourse of deciding an emergency motion for a stay, is not\nbinding on later merits panels.  The panel also concluded that,\neven if a merits panel may be bound in some circumstances\nby a motions panel, this panel would not be bound: two of the\nthree judges on the motions panel disagreed in part with the\nGovernment’s legal arguments in support of the MPP, and the\npanel’s  per  curiam  opinion  did  not  purport  to  decide\ndefinitively the legal questions presented.  In this respect, the\npanel noted that Judge Fletcher specifically addressed the\neffect of the legal analysis of the motions panel and expressed\nthe hope that the merits panel, with the benefit of full briefing\nand argument, would decide the legal questions differently.\nOn the merits, the panel concluded that plaintiffs had\nshown a likelihood of success on their claim that the return-\nto-Mexico  requirement  of  the  MPP  is  inconsistent  with\n§  1225(b).    The  Government  argued  that  the  MPP  is\nauthorized by § 1225(b)(2), which provides that, for certain\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 5 of 57\nINNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF 5\naliens arriving on land from a foreign territory contiguous to\nthe United States, the Attorney General may return the aliens\nto that territory pending removal proceedings.  Plaintiffs\nargued,  however,  that  they  were  arriving  aliens  under\n§ 1225(b)(1), rather than under § 1225(b)(2), and pointed out\nthat there is a contiguous territory return provision in § (b)(2),\nbut no such provision in § (b)(1).\nThe panel agreed, explaining that there are two distinct\ncategories of “applicants for admission” under § 1225.  First,\nthere are applicants described under § 1225(b)(1), who are\ninadmissible based on either of two grounds, both of which\nrelate to their documents or lack thereof.  Such applicants\nmay be placed in either expedited removal proceedings or\nregular removal proceedings under § 1229a.  Second, there\nare applicants described under § 1225(b)(2), who are, in the\nwords of the statute, “other aliens,” “to whom paragraph\n[(b)](1)” does not apply; that is, § (b)(2) applicants are those\nwho are inadmissible on grounds other than the two specified\nin § (b)(1).  Such applicants are placed in regular removal\nproceedings.  The panel noted that both § (b)(1) and § (b)(2)\napplicants can be placed in regular removal proceedings\nunder § 1229a, though by different routes, but concluded that\na § (b)(1) applicant does not become a § (b)(2) applicant, or\nvice versa, by virtue of being placed in a removal proceeding\nunder § 1229a.\nAddressing the precise statutory question posed by the\nMPP,  the  panel  held  that  a  plain-meaning  reading  of\n§ 1225(b)—as well as the Government’s longstanding and\nconsistent practice—made clear that a § (b)(1) applicant may\nnot  be  “returned”  to  a  contiguous  territory  under\n§ 1225(b)(2)(C), which is a procedure specific to a § (b)(2)\napplicant.\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 6 of 57\n6 INNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF\nThe panel next concluded that plaintiffs had shown a\nlikelihood of success on their claim that the MPP does not\ncomply with the United States’ treaty-based non-refoulement\nobligations  codified  at  8  U.S.C.  §  1231(b).    The  panel\nexplained that refoulement occurs when a government returns\naliens  to  a  country  where  their  lives  or  liberty  will  be\nthreatened  on  account  of  race,  religion,  nationality,\nmembership of a particular social group, or political opinion. \nFurther, the United States is obliged by treaty—namely, the\n1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of\nRefugees and the 1967 United Nations Protocol Relating to\nthe Status of Refugees—and implementing statute—namely,\n§ 1231(b)—to protect against refoulement of aliens arriving\nat the country’s borders.\nPlaintiffs  argued  that  the  MPP  provides  insufficient\nprotection against refoulement.  First, under the MPP, to stay\nin the United States during proceedings, an asylum seeker\nmust show that it is “more likely than not” that he or she will\nbe persecuted in Mexico, but that standard is higher than the\nordinary standing in screening interviews, in which aliens\nneed only establish a “credible fear,” which requires only a\n“significant possibility” of persecution.  Second, an asylum\nseeker under the MPP is not entitled to advance notice of, and\ntime to prepare for, the hearing with the asylum officer; to\nadvance notice of the criteria the asylum officer will use; to\nthe assistance of a lawyer during the hearing; or to any review\nof the asylum officer’s determination.  Third, an asylum\nofficer acting under the MPP does not ask an asylum seeker\nwhether he or she fears returning to Mexico; instead, asylum\nseekers must volunteer, without any prompting, that they fear\nreturning.  The Government disagreed with plaintiffs on the\ngrounds that: 1) § 1231(b) does not encompass a general non-\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 7 of 57\nINNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF 7\nrefoulement  obligation;  and  2)  the  MPP  satisfies  non-\nrefoulement obligations by providing sufficient procedures.\nThe panel rejected both arguments.  With respect to the\nsecond  argument,  the  panel  noted  that  the  Government\npointed to no evidence supporting its speculations either that\naliens will volunteer that they fear returning to Mexico, or\nthat there is little danger to non-Mexican aliens in Mexico. \nThe  panel  also  noted  that  the  Government  provided  no\nevidence to support its claim that any violence that returned\naliens face in Mexico is unlikely to be violence on account of\na protected ground.  Further, the panel quoted numerous\nsworn  declarations  to  the  district  court  that  directly\ncontradicted the unsupported speculations of the Government.\nAddressing the other preliminary injunction factors, the\npanel concluded that there is a significant likelihood that the\nindividual plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the MPP\nis not enjoined; uncontested evidence in the record establishes\nthat non-Mexicans returned to Mexico under the MPP risk\nsubstantial harm, even death, while they await adjudication of\ntheir applications for asylum.  Further, the panel concluded\nthat the balance of factors favored plaintiffs.  While the\nGovernment  has  an  interest  in  continuing  to  follow  the\ndirectives  of  the  MPP,  the  strength  of  that  interest  is\ndiminished by the likelihood that the MPP is inconsistent\nwith  §§  1225(b)  and  1231(b).    On  the  other  side,  the\nindividual  plaintiffs  risk  substantial  harm,  and  the\norganizational plaintiffs are hindered in their ability to carry\nout their missions.  The panel concluded that public interest\nsimilarly favored plaintiffs: while the public has a weighty\ninterest in efficient administration of the immigration laws,\nthe public also has an interest in ensuring that statutes enacted\nby their representatives are not imperiled by executive fiat.\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 8 of 57\n8 INNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF\nFinally,  considering  the  scope  of  the  district  court’s\ninjunction, the panel concluded that the district court did not\nabuse its discretion in setting aside the MPP.  The panel\nrecognized  that  nationwide  injunctions  have  become\nincreasingly controversial, but noted that it was a misnomer\nto call this order “nationwide,” as it operates only at the\nsouthern border and directs the action of officials only in four\nstates.  The panel explained that the district court did not\nabuse its discretion for two mutually reinforcing reasons. \nFirst, the APA provides that a reviewing court shall “set\naside” action that is not in accordance with the law and that\nthere is a presumption that an offending agency action should\nbe  set  aside  in  its  entirety.    Second,  cases  implicating\nimmigration  policy  have  a  particularly  strong  claim  for\nuniform relief, and this court has consistently recognized the\nauthority of district courts to enjoin unlawful policies on a\nuniversal basis.  The panel also observed that the Fifth\nCircuit, one of only two other federal circuits with states\nalong  the  southern  border,  has  held  that  nationwide\ninjunctions are appropriate in immigration cases.\nDissenting, Judge Fernandez wrote that he believes that\nthis panel is bound by the motions panel’s published decision\nin this case.  Judge Fernandez wrote that the panel is bound\nby the law of the circuit, which binds all courts within a\nparticular circuit, including the court of appeals itself, and\nremains binding unless overruled by the court sitting en banc,\nor by the Supreme Court.  Further, Judge Fernandez wrote\nthat, insofar as factual differences might allow precedent to\nbe  distinguished  on a  principled  basis,  in this  case, the\nsituation before this panel is in every material way the same\nas that before the motions panel.  Judge Fernandez also stated\nthat, in Lair v. Bullock, 798 F.3d 736 (9th Cir. 2015), this\ncourt held that a motions panel’s published opinion binds\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 9 of 57\nINNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF 9\nfuture panels the same as does a merits panel’s published\nopinion.  Judge Fernandez also concluded that the law of the\ncase doctrine binds this panel, noting that he did not perceive\nany of the exceptions to the doctrine to be involved here.\nApplying those doctrines, Judge Fernandez concluded\nthat: 1) plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on their claim that\nthe MPP was not authorized by § 1225(b)(2)(C); 2) plaintiffs\nare not likely to succeed on their claim that the MPP’s\nadoption violated the notice and comment provisions of the\nAPA; and 3) the preliminary injunction should be vacated. \nJudge Fernandez stated that he expressed no opinion on\nwhether the district court could issue a narrower injunction.\nCOUNSEL\nScott  G.

FLETCHER, Circuit Judge:\nPlaintiffs  brought  suit  in  district  court  seeking  an\ninjunction against the Government’s recently promulgated\nMigrant Protection Protocols (“MPP”), under which non-\nMexican  asylum seekers  who  present  themselves  at  our\nsouthern border are required to wait in Mexico while their\nasylum  applications  are  adjudicated.    The  district  court\nentered a preliminary injunction setting aside the MPP, and\nthe Government appealed.  We affirm.\nI.  Background\nIn January 2019, the Department of Homeland Security\n(“DHS”) promulgated the MPP without going through notice-\nand-comment rulemaking.  The MPP provides that non-\nMexican asylum seekers arriving at our southern border be\n“returned to Mexico for the duration of their immigration\nproceedings, rather than either being detained for expedited\nor regular removal proceedings or issued notices to appear for\nregular  removal  proceedings.”    Innovation  Law  Lab  v.\nNielsen,  366  F.  Supp.  3d  1110,  1114  (N.D.  Cal.  2019)\n(quotation marks omitted).  The MPP does not apply to\ncertain groups, including “unaccompanied alien children,”\n“aliens processed for expedited removal,” “aliens with known\nphysical  [or]  mental  health  issues,”  “returning  [Legal\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 12 of 57\n12 INNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF\nPermanent Residents] seeking admission,” and “aliens with\nan advance parole document or in parole status.”\nDHS issued guidance documents to implement the MPP. \nUnder this guidance, asylum seekers who cross the border\nand are subject to the MPP are given a Notice to Appear in\nimmigration court and returned to Mexico to await their court\ndate.  Asylum seekers may re-enter the United States to\nappear for their court dates.  The guidance instructs officials\nnot to return any alien who will more likely than not suffer\npersecution if returned to Mexico.  However, this instruction\napplies only to an alien “who affirmatively states that he or\nshe has a fear of persecution or torture in Mexico, or a fear of\nreturn to Mexico.”  Officers are not instructed to ask aliens\nwhether they fear returning to Mexico.  If an asylum officer\ndetermines, based on an alien’s volunteered statement, that he\nor she will more likely than not suffer persecution in Mexico,\nthe alien is not subject to return to Mexico under the MPP.\nThe MPP went into effect on January 28, 2019.  It was\nfirst implemented at the San Ysidro, California, port of entry\nand was later expanded across the entire southern border.\nThe MPP has had serious adverse consequences for the\nindividual  plaintiffs. Plaintiffs presented  evidence in the\ndistrict court that they, as well as others returned to Mexico\nunder  the  MPP,  face  targeted  discrimination,  physical\nviolence,  sexual  assault,  overwhelmed  and  corrupt  law\nenforcement, lack of food and shelter, and practical obstacles\nto participation in court proceedings in the United States. \nThe hardship and danger to individuals returned to Mexico\nunder the MPP have been repeatedly confirmed by reliable\nnews  reports.

The MPP has substantially hindered\nthe organizations’ “ability to carry out their core mission of\nproviding  representation  to  aliens  seeking  admission,\nincluding asylum seekers,” Innovation Law Lab, 366 F. Supp.\n3d at 1129, and has forced them to divert resources because\nof increased costs imposed by the MPP.\nThe Government has not argued in this court that either\nthe individual or organizational plaintiffs lack standing under\nArticle  III,  but  we  have  an  independent  obligation  to\ndetermine our jurisdiction under Article III.  The individual\nplaintiffs, all of whom have been returned to Mexico under\nthe  MPP,  obviously  have  Article  III  standing.    The\norganizational plaintiffs also have Article III standing.  The\nGovernment  conceded  in  the  district  court  that  the\norganizational plaintiffs have Article III standing based on\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 14 of 57\n14 INNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF\nEast  Bay  Sanctuary  Covenant  v.  Trump,  932  F.3d  742,\n765–67 (9th Cir. 2018), given their decreased ability to carry\nout their core missions as well as the diversion of their\nresources, both caused by the MPP.  See Innovation Law Lab,\n366 F. Supp. at 1120–22.  Because East Bay Sanctuary\nCovenant was a decision by a motions panel on an emergency\nstay motion, we are not obligated to follow it as binding\nprecedent.  See discussion, infra, Part III.  However, we are\npersuaded by its reasoning and hold that the organizational\nplaintiffs have Article III standing.\nII.  Proceedings in the District Court\nPlaintiffs filed suit in district court seeking an injunction,\nalleging, inter alia, that the MPP is inconsistent with the\nImmigration  and  Nationality  Act  (“INA”),  specifically\n8 U.S.C. §§ 1225(b) and 1231(b), and that they have a right\nto a remedy under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  Section 706(2)(A)\nprovides, “The reviewing court shall . . . hold unlawful and\nset aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be\n. . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise\nnot in accordance with law.”  (Internal numbering omitted.)\nThe  district  court  held  that  plaintiffs  had  shown  a\nlikelihood of success on the merits of their claim that the\nMPP  is  inconsistent  with  §  1225(b).    Id.  at  1123.  The\nGovernment  contended  that  the  MPP  is  authorized  by\n§  1225(b)(2).    Plaintiffs  argued,  however,  that  they  are\narriving  aliens  under  §  1225(b)(1)  rather  than  under\n§ 1225(b)(2).  They pointed out that there is a contiguous\nterritory return provision in § (b)(2) but no such provision in\n§ (b)(1).  The district court agreed with plaintiffs:\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 15 of 57\nINNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF 15\nOn its face, . . . the contiguous territory return\nprovision may be applied to aliens described\nin  subparagraph  (b)(2)(A).    Pursuant  to\nsubparagraph  (b)(2)(B),  however,  that\nexpressly  excludes  any  alien  “to  whom\nparagraph [(b)](1) applies.”\nId. (emphasis in original).  The court concluded, “Applying\nthe plain language of the statute, [the individual plaintiffs]\nsimply are not subject to the contiguous territory return\nprovision.” Id.\nThe district court also held that plaintiffs had shown a\nlikelihood of success on the merits of their claim that the\nMPP violates § 1231(b)(3), the statutory implementation of\nthe United States’ treaty-based non-refoulement obligations. \nThe district court held that “plaintiffs have shown they are\nmore  likely  than  not  to  prevail  on  the  merits  of  their\ncontention  that  defendants  adopted  the  MPP  without\nsufficient regard to refoulement issues.”  Id. at 1127.  In so\nholding,  the  district  court  noted  that  the  MPP  does  not\ninstruct asylum officers to ask asylum seekers whether they\nfear returning to Mexico.  Rather, “the MPP provides only for\nreview of potential  refoulement concerns  when an alien\n‘affirmatively’ raises the point.”  Id.  The court further held\nthat it was more likely than not that the MPP should have\nbeen adopted through notice-and-comment rulemaking with\nrespect to the non-refoulement aspects of the MPP.  Id.\nat 1128.\nWith respect to the individual plaintiffs, the district court\nfound that “[w]hile the precise degree of risk and specific\nharms  that  plaintiffs  might  suffer  in  this  case  may  be\ndebatable,  there  is  no  real  question  that  it  includes  the\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 16 of 57\n16 INNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF\npossibility of irreparable injury, sufficient to support interim\nrelief in light of the showing on the merits.”  Id. at 1129. \nWith respect to the organizational plaintiffs, the court found\nthat  they  had  “shown  a  likelihood  of  harm  in  terms  of\nimpairment of their ability to carry out their core mission of\nproviding  representation  to  aliens  seeking  admission,\nincluding asylum seekers.”  Id.  Finally, the court held that\nthe balance of equities and the public interest support the\nissuance of a preliminary injunction.  Id.\nRelying on a decision of our court, the district court\nissued a preliminary injunction setting aside the MPP.  The\ncourt noted:\n[D]efendants have not shown the injunction in\nthis case can be limited geographically.  This\nis not a case implicating local concerns or\nvalues.  There is no apparent reason that any\nof  the  places  to  which  the  MPP  might\nultimately  be  extended  have  interests  that\nmaterially differ from those presented in San\nYsidro.\nId. at 1130.\nIII.  Proceedings Before the Motions Panel\nThe district court issued its preliminary injunction on\nApril 8, 2019.  The Government filed an appeal on April 10\nand  the  next  day  requested  an  emergency  stay  pending\nappeal.  In accordance with our regular procedures, our April\nmotions  panel  heard  the  Government’s  request  for  an\nemergency stay.  The motions panel held oral argument on\nthe stay on April 24.  In three written opinions, the panel\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 17 of 57\nINNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF 17\nunanimously  granted  the  emergency  stay  on  May  7. \nInnovation Law Lab v. McAleenan, 924 F.3d 503 (9th Cir.\n2019).\nIn a per curiam opinion, the motions panel disagreed, by\na vote of two to one, with the district court’s holding that\nplaintiffs were likely to succeed in their statutory argument\nthat the MPP is inconsistent with 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b).  Id.\nat 508–09.  The panel majority stated its legal conclusion in\ntentative terms, writing that it was “doubtful that subsection\n(b)(1)  [of  §  1225]  ‘applies’  to  [plaintiffs.]”    Id.  at  509\n(emphasis added).\nJudge Watford concurred in the per curiam opinion but\nwrote separately to express concern that the MPP is arbitrary\nand capricious because it lacks sufficient non-refoulement\nprotections.  Id. at 511 (Watford, J., concurring).  Judge\nWatford expressed concern that asylum officers do not ask\nasylum applicants whether they have a fear of returning to\nMexico:  “One suspects the agency is not asking an important\nquestion  during  the  interview  process  simply  because it\nwould prefer not to hear the answer.”  Id.  Judge Watford\nconcluded, “DHS’s policy is virtually guaranteed to result in\nsome number of applicants being returned to Mexico in\nviolation of the United States’ non-refoulement obligations.” \nId.\nJudge Fletcher concurred only in the result.  He wrote\nseparately,  arguing  that  the  MPP  was  inconsistent  with\n8 U.S.C. § 1225(b).  Id. at 512 (W. Fletcher, J., concurring in\nthe result).  In his view, asylum seekers subject to the MPP\nare properly characterized as applicants under § 1225(b)(1)\nrather than § 1225(b)(2), and are thus protected against being\nreturned to Mexico pending adjudication of their applications. \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 18 of 57\n18 INNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF\nJudge Fletcher emphasized the preliminary nature of the\nemergency  stay  proceedings  before  the  motions  panel,\nwriting, “I am hopeful that the regular argument panel that\nwill  ultimately  hear  the  appeal,  with  the  benefit  of  full\nbriefing and regularly scheduled argument, will be able to see\nthe Government’s arguments for what they are—baseless\narguments in support of an illegal policy[.]”  Id. at 518.\nIV.  Standard of Review\nWhen deciding whether to issue a preliminary injunction,\na district court considers whether the requesting party has\nshown “that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is\nlikely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary\nrelief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an\ninjunction is in the public interest.”  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def.\nCouncil, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  Likelihood of success\non the merits is a threshold inquiry and the most important\nfactor.  See, e.g., Edge v. City of Everett, 929 F.3d 657, 663\n(9th Cir. 2019).\nWe review a grant of a preliminary injunction for abuse\nof discretion.  See, e.g., United States v. California, 921 F.3d\n865, 877 (9th Cir. 2019).  “The district court’s interpretation\nof the underlying legal principles, however, is subject to de\nnovo review and a district court abuses its discretion when it\nmakes an error of law.”  Sw. Voter Registration Educ. Project\nv. Shelley, 344 F.3d 914, 918 (9th Cir. 2003) (en banc).\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 19 of 57\nINNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF 19\nV.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits\nA.  Effect of the Motions Panel’s Decision\nA preliminary question is whether a merits panel is bound\nby the analysis of a motions panel on a question of law,\nperformed in the course of deciding an emergency request for\na stay pending appeal.  On that question, we follow East Bay\nSanctuary Covenant v. Trump, Nos. 18-17274 and 18-17436\n(9th Cir. 2020), argued on the same day as this case, in which\nwe held that a motions panel’s legal analysis, performed\nduring the course of deciding an emergency motion for a stay,\nis not binding on later merits panels.  Such a decision by a\nmotions panel is “a probabilistic endeavor,” “doctrinally\ndistinct” from the question considered by the later merits\npanel,  and  “issued  without  oral  argument,  on  limited\ntimelines, and in reliance on limited briefing.”  Id. at 21–22,\n20.  “Such a predictive analysis should not, and does not,\nforever bind the merits of the parties’ claims.”  Id. at 22.  At\noral argument in this case, the Government acknowledged \n“that law of the circuit treatment does not apply to [the\nmotion’s panel’s decision].”  The Government later reiterated\nthat it was “not advocating for law of the circuit treatment.” \nThe Government “agree[d] that that is inappropriate in the\ncontext of a motions panel decision.”\nEven if, acting as a merits panel, we may be bound in\nsome circumstances by a decision by a motions panel on a\nlegal question, we would in any event not be bound in the\ncase now before us.  Two of the three judges on the motions\npanel  disagreed  in  part  with  the  Government’s  legal\narguments in support of the MPP.  Further, the motions\npanel’s  per  curiam  opinion  did  not  purport  to  decide\ndefinitively  the  legal  questions  presented  to  it  in  the\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 20 of 57\n20 INNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF\nemergency stay motion.  The per curiam spoke in terms of\ndoubt  and  likelihood,  rather  than  in  terms  of  definitive\nholdings.  Innovation Law Lab, 924 F.3d at 509; see also\nsupra  I.C.2.    Indeed,  Judge  Fletcher,  who  concurred  in\ngranting the emergency stay, specifically addressed the effect\nof the legal analysis of the motions panel and expressed the\nhope that the merits panel, with the benefit of full briefing\nand argument, would decide the legal questions differently.\nB.  Questions on the Merits\nPlaintiffs challenge two aspects of the MPP.  First, they\nchallenge  the  requirement  that  asylum  seekers  return  to\nMexico and wait there while their applications for asylum are\nadjudicated.    They  contend  that  this  requirement  is\ninconsistent with the INA, as amended in 1996 by the Illegal\nImmigration  Reform  and  Immigrant  Responsbility  Act\n(“IIRIRA”).  Second, in the alternative, they challenge the\nfailure of asylum officers to ask asylum seekers whether they\nfear being returned to Mexico.  They contend that this failure\nis  inconsistent  with  our  treaty-based  non-refoulement\nobligations.  They contend, further, that with respect to non-\nrefoulement, the MPP should have been adopted only after\nnotice-and-comment rulemaking.\nWe address these challenges in turn.  We conclude that\nplaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on their claim\nthat  the  return-to-Mexico  requirement  of  the  MPP  is\ninconsistent with 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b).  We further conclude\nthat plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on their\nclaim that the MPP does not comply with our treaty-based\nnon-refoulement obligations codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b). \nWe do not reach the question whether they have shown a\nlikelihood of success on their claim that the anti-refoulement\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 21 of 57\nINNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF 21\naspect of the MPP should have been adopted through notice-\nand-comment rulemaking.\n1.  Return to Mexico\nThe essential feature of the MPP is that non-Mexican\nasylum seekers who arrive at a port of entry along the United\nStates’ southern border must be returned to Mexico to wait\nwhile their asylum applications are adjudicated.  Plaintiffs\ncontend that the requirement that they wait in Mexico is\ninconsistent  with 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b).  The government\ncontends, to the contrary, that the MPP is consistent with\n§ 1225(b).\nThe relevant text of § 1225 is as follows:\n(a) Inspection\n(1) Aliens  treated  as  applicants  for\nadmission\nAn alien present in the United States\nwho has not been admitted . . . shall be\ndeemed for purposes of this chapter an\napplicant for admission.\n. . .\n(b) Inspection of applicants for admission\n(1) Inspection of aliens arriving in the\nUnited  States  and  certain  other\naliens who have not been admitted\nor paroled\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 22 of 57\n22 INNOVATION LAW LAB V.

WOLF\n(ii) to  whom  paragraph  (1)\napplies, or\n(iii) who is a stowaway.\n(C) Treatment of aliens arriving\nfrom contiguous territory\nIn the case of an alien described in\nsubparagraph (A) who is arriving on\nland (whether or not at a designated\nport of arrival) from a foreign territory\ncontiguous to the United States, the\nAttorney General may return the alien\nto that territory pending a proceeding\nunder section 1229a of this title.\nThere are two categories of “applicants for admission”\nunder § 1225.  § 1225(a).  First, there are applicants described\nin § 1225(b)(1).  Second, there are applicants described in\n§ 1225(b)(2).\nApplicants described in § 1225(b)(1) are inadmissible\nbased on either of two grounds, both of which relate to their\ndocuments  or  lack  thereof.    Applicants  described  in\n§ 1225(b)(2) are in an entirely separate category.  In the\nwords of the statute, they are “other aliens.”  § 1225(b)(2)\n(heading).  Put differently, again in the words of the statute,\n§  (b)(2)  applicants  are  applicants  “to  whom  paragraph\n[(b)](1)”  does  not  apply.    §  1225(b)(2)(B)(ii).    That  is,\n§ (b)(1) applicants are those who are inadmissible on either\nof the two grounds specified in that subsection.  Section\n(b)(2) applicants are all other inadmissible applicants.\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 25 of 57\nINNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF 25\nSection (b)(1) applicants are more numerous than § (b)(2)\napplicants, but § (b)(2) is a broader category in the sense that\n§ (b)(2) applicants are inadmissible on more grounds than\n§ (b)(1) applicants.  Inadmissable applicants under § (b)(1)\nare  aliens  traveling  with  fraudulent  documents\n(§  1182(a)(6)(C))  or  no  documents  (§  1182(a)(7)).    By\ncontrast, inadmissable applicants under § (b)(2) include, inter\nalia, aliens with “a communicable disease of public health\nsignificance”  or  who  are  “drug  abuser[s]  or  addict[s]”\n(§ 1182(a)(1)(A)(i), (iv)); aliens who have “committed . . . a\ncrime involving moral turpitude” or who have “violat[ed] . . .\nany law or regulation . . . relating to a controlled substance”\n(§ 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)); aliens who “seek to enter the United\nStates . . . to violate any law of the United States relating to\nespionage or sabotage,” or who have “engaged in a terrorist\nactivity” (§ 1182(a)(3)(A), (B)); aliens who are “likely . . . to\nbecome a public charge” (§ 1182(a)(4)(A)); and aliens who\nare alien “smugglers” (§ 1182(a)(6)(E)).\nThe Supreme Court recently distinguished § (b)(1) and\n§ (b)(2) applicants, stating unambiguously that they fall into\ntwo separate categories:\n[A]pplicants for admission fall into one of two\ncategories, those covered by § 1225(b)(1) and\nthose  covered  by  §  1225(b)(2).  Section\n1225(b)(1)  applies  to  aliens  initially\ndetermined to be inadmissible due to fraud,\nmisrepresentation,  or  lack  of  valid\ndocumentation.  .  .  .  Section  1225(b)(2)  is\nbroader. It serves as a catchall provision that\napplies to all applicants for admission not\ncovered by § 1225(b)(1).\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 26 of 57\n26 INNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF\nJennings v. Rodriguez, 138 S. Ct. 830, 837 (2018) (emphasis\nadded) (citations omitted).\nEven more recently, the Attorney General of the United\nStates, through the Board of Immigration Appeals, drew the\nsame  distinction  and  briefly  described  the  procedures\napplicable to the two categories:\nUnder  section  235  of  the  Act  [8  U.S.C.\n§ 1225], all aliens “arriv[ing] in the United\nStates”  or  “present  in  the  United  States\n[without  having]  been  admitted”  are\nconsidered “applicants for admission,” who\n“shall be inspected by immigration officers.”\nINA § 235(a)(1), (3). [8 U.S.C. § 1225(a)(1),\n(3).] In most cases, those inspections yield\none of three outcomes. First, if an alien is\n“clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be\nadmitted,” he will be permitted to enter, or\nremain  in,  the  country  without  further\nproceedings.  Id. § 235(b)(2)(A).  [8 U.S.C.\n§ 1225(b)(2)(A).]  Second, if the alien is not\nclearly admissible, then, generally, he will be\nplaced in “proceeding[s] under section 240\n[8 U.S.C. § 1229a]” of the Act—that is, full\nremoval proceedings.  Id.  Third, if the alien is\ninadmissible on one of two specified grounds\nand meets certain additional criteria, DHS\nmay place him in either expedited or full\nproceedings. Id. § 235(b)(1)(A)(i) [8 U.S.C.\n§ 1225(b)(1)(A)(i)]; see Matter of E-R-M- &\nL-R-M-, 25 I&N Dec. 520, 524 (BIA 2011).\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 27 of 57\nINNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF 27\nMatter of M-S-, 27 I. & N. Dec. 509, 510 (BIA April 16,\n2019).\nThe  procedures  specific  to  the  two  categories  of\napplicants are outlined in their respective subsections.  To\nsome extent, the statutorily prescribed procedures are the\nsame for both categories.  If a § (b)(1) applicant passes his or\nher credible fear interview, he or she will be placed in regular\nremoval proceedings under 8 U.S.C. § 1229a.  See 8 C.F.R.\n§ 208.30(f).  A § (b)(1) applicant may also be placed directly\ninto  regular  removal  proceedings  under  §  1229a  at  the\ndiscretion of the Government.  See Matter of E-R-M- & L-R-\nM-, 25 I. & N. Dec. 520, 522 (BIA 2011).  A § (b)(2)\napplicant who is “not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to\nbe admitted”  is automatically  placed in regular removal\nproceedings under § 1229a.  See § 1225(b)(2)(A).\nBoth § (b)(1) and § (b)(2) applicants can thus be placed\nin regular removal proceedings under § 1229a, though by\ndifferent routes.  But the fact that an applicant is in removal\nproceedings  under  §  1229a  does  not  change  his  or  her\nunderlying category.  A § (b)(1) applicant does not become\na § (b)(2) applicant, or vice versa, by virtue of being placed\nin a removal proceeding under § 1229a.\nHowever, the statutory procedures for the two categories\nare not identical.  Some of the procedures are exclusive to one\ncategory or the other.  For example, if a § (b)(1) applicant\nfails to pass his or her credible fear interview, he or she may\nbe removed in an expedited proceeding without a regular\nremoval proceeding under § 1229a.  See § 1225(b)(1)(A), (B). \nThere is no comparable procedure specified in § (b)(2) for\nexpedited removal of a § (b)(2) applicant.  Further, in some\ncircumstances a § (b)(2) applicant may be “returned” to a\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 28 of 57\n28 INNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF\n“territory contiguous to the United States” pending his or her\nregular  removal  proceeding  under  §  1229a.    See\n§ 1225(b)(2)(C).  There is no comparable “return” procedure\nspecified in §1225(b)(1) for a § (b)(1) applicant.\nThe statutory question posed by the MPP is whether a\n§ (b)(1) applicant may be “returned” to a contiguous territory\nunder § 1225(b)(2)(C).  That is, may a § (b)(1) applicant be\nsubjected to a procedure specified for a § (b)(2) applicant?  A\nplain-meaning  reading  of  §  1225(b)—as  well  as  the\nGovernment’s longstanding and consistent practice up until\nnow—tell us that the answer is “no.”\nThere is nothing in § 1225(b)(1) to indicate that a § (b)(1)\napplicant may be “returned” under § 1225(b)(2)(C).  Section\n(b)(1)(A)(i) tells us with respect to § (b)(1) applicants that an\n“officer shall order the alien removed . . . without further\nhearing or review unless the alien indicates either an intention\nto apply for asylum . . . or a fear of persecution.”  Section\n(b)(1)(A)(ii) tells us that § (b)(1) applicants who indicate an\nintention to apply for asylum or a fear of persecution “shall”\nbe referred by the immigration officer to an “asylum officer”\nfor an interview.  The remainder of § 1225(b)(1) specifies\nwhat  happens  to  a  §  (b)(1)  applicant  depending  on  the\ndetermination  of  the  asylum  officer—either  expedited\nremoval  or  detention  pending  further  consideration. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii)–(iii).  There is nothing in § 1225(b)(1)\nstating, or even suggesting, that a § (b)(1) applicant is subject\nto the “return” procedure of § 1225(b)(2)(C).\nNor is there anything in § 1225(b)(2) to indicate that a\n§ (b)(1) applicant may be “returned” under § 1225(b)(2)(C). \nTaking  §  1225(b)(2)  subparagraph  by  subparagraph,  it\nprovides as follows.  Subparagraph (A) tells us that unless a\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 29 of 57\nINNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF 29\n§ (b)(2) applicant is “clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to\nbe admitted,” she or he “shall be detained” for a removal\nproceeding under § 1229a.  § 1225(b)(2)(A).  Subparagraph\n(A)  is  “[s]ubject  to  subparagraphs  (B)  and  (C).”    Id. \nSubparagraph (B) tells us that subparagraph (A) does not\napply to three categories of aliens—“crewm[e]n,” § (b)(1)\napplicants, and “stowaway[s].”  § 1225(b)(2)(B).  Finally,\nsubparagraph (C) tells us that a § (b)(2) applicant who arrives\n“on land . . . from a foreign territory contiguous to the United\nStates,” instead of being “detained” under subparagraph (A)\npending his or her removal proceeding under § 1229a, may be\n“returned”  to  that  contiguous  territory  pending  that\nproceeding.  § 1225(b)(2)(C).  Section (b)(1) applicants are\nmentioned only once in § 1225(b)(2), in subparagraph (B)(ii). \nThat subparagraph specifies that subparagraph (A)—which\nautomatically entitles § (b)(2) applicants to regular removal\nproceedings  under § 1229a—does not apply to § (b)(1)\napplicants.\nThe  “return-to-a-contiguous-territory”  provision  of\n§ 1225(b)(2)(C) is thus available only for § (b)(2) applicants. \nThere is no plausible way to read the statute otherwise. \nUnder a plain-meaning reading of the text, as well as the\nGovernment’s  longstanding  and  consistent  practice,  the\nstatutory authority upon which the Government now relies\nsimply does not exist.\nThe Government nonetheless contends that § (b)(2)(C)\nauthorizes  the  return  to  Mexico  not  only  of  §  (b)(2)\napplicants, but also of § (b)(1) applicants.  The Government\nmakes  essentially  three  arguments  in  support  of  this\ncontention.  None is persuasive.\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 30 of 57\n30 INNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF\nFirst, the Government argues that § (b)(1) applicants are\na subset of § (b)(2) applicants.  Blue Brief at 35.  Under the\nGovernment’s argument, there are § (b)(1) applicants, defined\nin § (b)(1), and there are § (b)(2) applicants, defined as all\napplicants, including § (b)(2) and § (b)(1) applicants.  The\nGovernment argues that DHS, in its discretion, can therefore\napply the procedures specified in § (b)(2) to a § (b)(1)\napplicant.  That is, as stated in its brief, the Government has\n“discretion to make the initial ‘determin[ation]’ whether to\napply section 1225(b)(1) or section 1225(b)(2) to a given\nalien.”  Blue Brief at 30.\nThe Government’s argument ignores the statutory text,\nthe Supreme Court’s opinion in Jennings, and the opinion of\nits own Attorney General in Matter of M-S-.  The text of\n§ 1225(b) tells us that § (b)(1) and § (b)(2) are separate and\nnon-overlapping categories.  In Jennings, the Supreme Court\ntold us explicitly that § (b)(1) and § (b)(2) applicants fall into\nseparate and non-overlapping categories.  In Matter of M-S-,\nthe Attorney General wrote that applicants are subject to\ndifferent procedures depending on whether they are § (b)(1)\nor § (b)(2) applicants.\nSecond, the Government argues that § (b)(2)(B)(ii) allows\nDHS, in its discretion, to “apply” to a § (b)(1) applicant either\nprocedures  described  in  §  (b)(1)  or  those  described  in\n§ (b)(2).  The Government’s second argument is necessitated\nby  its  first.    To  understand  the  Government’s  second\nargument,  one  must  keep  in  mind  that  §  (b)(2)(A)\nautomatically entitles a § (b)(2) applicant to a regular removal\nhearing under § 1229a.  But we know from § (b)(1) that not\nall § (b)(1) applicants are entitled to a removal hearing under\n§ 1229a.  Having argued that § (b)(2) applicants include not\nonly § (b)(2) but also § (b)(1) applicants, the Government\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 31 of 57\nINNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF 31\nneeds some way to avoid giving regular removal proceedings\nto all § (b)(1) applicants.  The best the Government can do is\nto rely on § (b)(2)(B)(ii), which provides:  “Subparagraph (A)\nshall not apply to an alien . . . to whom paragraph [(b)](1)\napplies.”    §  1225(b)(2)(B)(ii)  (emphasis  added).    The\nGovernment thus argues that § (b)(2)(B)(ii) allows DHS, in\nits discretion, to “apply,” or not apply, § (b)(2)(A) to a\n§ (b)(1) applicant.\nThe Government misreads § (b)(2)(B)(ii).  Subparagraph\n(B) tells us, “Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to an alien —\n(i) who is a crewman, (ii) to whom paragraph [(b)](1) applies,\nor (iii) who is a stowaway.”  The function of § (b)(2)(B)(ii)\nis  to  make  sure  that  we  understand  that  the  automatic\nentitlement to a regular removal hearing under § 1229a,\nspecified in § (b)(2)(A) for a § (b)(2) applicant, does not\napply to a § (b)(1) applicant.  However, the Government\nargues that § (b)(2)(B)(ii) authorizes the Government to\nperform an act.  That act is to “apply” the expedited removal\nprocedures of § (b)(1) to some of the aliens under § (b)(2), as\nthe Government defines § (b)(2) applicants.\nThere  is  a  fatal  syntactical  problem  with  the\nGovernment’s argument.  “Apply” is used twice in the same\nsentence in § (b)(2)(B)(ii).  The first time the word is used, in\nthe lead-in to the section, it refers to the application of a\nstatutory section (“Subparagraph (A) shall not apply”).  The\nsecond time the word is used, it is used in the same manner,\nagain referring to the application of a statutory section (“to\nwhom paragraph [(b)](1) applies”).  When the word is used\nthe first time, it tells us that subparagraph (A) shall not apply. \nWhen the word is used the second time, it tells us to whom\nsubparagraph (A) shall not apply:  it does not apply to\napplicants to whom § (b)(1) applies.  The word is used in the\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 32 of 57\n32 INNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF\nsame  manner  both  times  to  refer  to  the  application  of\nsubparagraph (A).  The word is not used the first time to refer\nto the application of a subparagraph (A), and the second time\nto an action by DHS.\nThe  Government’s  third  argument  is  based  on  the\nsupposed culpability of § (b)(1) applicants.  We know from\n§ (b)(2)(A) that § (b)(2) applicants are automatically entitled\nto  full  removal  proceedings  under  §  1229a.    However,\n§  (b)(2)  applicants  may  be  returned  to  Mexico  under\n§ (b)(2)(C) to await the outcome of their removal hearing\nunder § 1229a.  It makes sense for the Government, in its\ndiscretion, to require some § (b)(2) applicants to remain in\nMexico while their asylum applications are adjudicated, for\nsome  §  (b)(2)  applicants  are  extremely  undesirable\napplicants.  As discussed above, § (b)(2) applicants include\nspies, terrorists, alien smugglers, and drug traffickers.\nWhen the Government was before the motions panel in\nthis case, it argued that § (b)(1) applicants are more culpable\nthan § (b)(2) applicants and therefore deserve to be forced to\nwait in Mexico while their asylum applications are being\nadjudicated.    In  its  argument  to  the  motions  panel,  the\nGovernment  compared  §  (b)(1)  and  §  (b)(2)  applicants,\ncharacterizing § (b)(2) applicants as “less-culpable arriving\naliens.”  The Government argued that returning § (b)(2), but\nnot § (b)(1), applicants to a contiguous territory would have\n“the perverse effect of privileging aliens who attempt to\nobtain entry to the United States by fraud . . . over aliens who\nfollow our laws.”\nThe Government had it exactly backwards.  Section (b)(1)\napplicants are those who are “inadmissible under section\n1182(a)(6)(C) or 1182(a)(7)” of Title 8.  These two sections\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 33 of 57\nINNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF 33\ndescribe applicants who are inadmissible because they lack\nrequired documents rather than because they have a criminal\nhistory or otherwise pose a danger to the United States. \nSection 1182(a)(6)(C), entitled “Misrepresentation,” covers,\ninter alia, aliens using fraudulent documents.  That is, it\ncovers aliens who travel under false documents and who,\nonce they arrive at the border or enter the country, apply for\nasylum.    Section  1182(a)(7),  entitled  “Documentation\nrequirements,” covers aliens traveling without documents.  In\nshort, § (b)(1) applies to bona fide asylum applicants, who\ncommonly have fraudulent documents or no documents at all. \nIndeed, for many such applicants, fraudulent documents are\ntheir only means of fleeing persecution, even death, in their\nown countries.  The structure of § (b)(1), which contains\ndetailed  provisions  for  processing  asylum  seekers,\ndemonstrates  that  Congress  recognized  that  §  (b)(1)\napplicants may have valid asylum claims and should therefore\nreceive the procedures specified in § (b)(1).\nIn its argument to our merits panel, the Government made\na version of the same argument it had made earlier to the\nmotions panel.  After referring to (but not describing) § (b)(2)\napplicants, the Government now argues in its opening brief:\nSection  1225(b)(1),  meanwhile,  reaches,\namong  other  classes  of  aliens,  those  who\nengage in fraud or willful misrepresentations\nin an attempt to deceive the United States into\ngranting an immigration benefit.  See 8 U.S.C.\n§ 1182(a)(6)(C).  Plaintiffs have not explained\nwhy Congress would have wanted that class\nof aliens to be exempt from temporary return\nto  Mexico  while  their  full  removal\nproceedings are ongoing.\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 34 of 57\n34 INNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF\nBlue Brief at 37–38 (emphasis in original).\nWe need not look far to discern Congress’s motivation in\nauthorizing return of § (b)(2) applicants but not § (b)(1)\napplicants.  Section (b)(2)(C) was added to IIRIRA late in the\ndrafting process, in the wake of Matter of Sanchez-Avila,\n21 I. & N. Dec. 444 (BIA 1996).  Sanchez-Avila was a\nMexican national who applied for entry as a “resident alien\ncommuter” but who was charged with being inadmissible due\nto his “involvement with controlled substances.”  Id. at 445. \nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i) (§ (b)(2) applicants include\naliens who have “violat[ed] . . . any law or regulation . . .\nrelating to a controlled substance”).  In order to prevent aliens\nlike Sanchez-Avila from staying in the United States during\nthe pendency of their guaranteed regular removal proceeding\nunder § 1229a, as they would otherwise have a right to do\nunder  §  (b)(2)(A),  Congress  added  §  1225(b)(2)(C). \nCongress  had  specifically  in  mind  undesirable  §  (b)(2)\napplicants like Sanchez-Avila.  It did not have in mind bona\nfide asylum seekers under § (b)(1).\nWe  therefore  conclude  that  plaintiffs  have  shown  a\nlikelihood of success on the merits of their claim that the\nMPP is inconsistent with 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b).\n2.  Refoulement\n Plaintiffs claim that the MPP is invalid in part, either\nbecause  it  violates  the  United  States’  treaty-based  anti-\nrefoulement  obligations,  codified  at  8  U.S.C.\n§ 1231(b)(3)(A), or because, with respect to refoulement, the\nMPP was improperly adopted without notice-and-comment\nrulemaking.  Our holding that plaintiffs are likely to succeed\non their claim that the MPP is invalid in its entirety because\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 35 of 57\nINNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF 35\nit is inconsistent with § 1225(b) makes it unnecessary to\ndecide plaintiffs’ second claim. We nonetheless address it as\nan alternative ground, under which we hold the MPP invalid\nin part.\nRefoulement occurs when a government returns aliens to\na country where their lives or liberty will be threatened on\naccount  of  race,  religion,  nationality,  membership  of  a\nparticular social group, or political opinion.  The United\nStates is obliged by treaty and implementing statute, as\ndescribed below, to protect against refoulement of aliens\narriving at our borders.\nParagraph one of Article 33 of the 1951 United Nations\nConvention Relating to the Status of Refugees, entitled,\n“Prohibition  of  expulsion  or  return  (‘refoulement’),”\nprovides:\nNo Contracting State shall expel or return\n(“refouler”)  a  refugee  in  any  manner\nwhatsoever to the frontiers of territories where\nhis life or freedom would be threatened on\naccount  of  his  race,  religion,  nationality,\nmembership of a particular social group or\npolitical opinion.\nThe United States is not a party to the 1951 Convention, but\nin 1968 we acceded to the United Nations Protocol Relating\nto the Status of Refugees, Jan. 31, 1967.  INS v. Stevic,\n467 U.S. 407, 416 (1984).  “The Protocol bound parties to\ncomply with the substantive provisions of Articles 2 through\n34 of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of\nRefugees.”  Id.  Twelve years later, Congress passed the\nRefugee Act of 1980, implementing our obligations under the\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 36 of 57\n36 INNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF\n1967 Protocol.  “If one thing is clear from the legislative\nhistory of the . . . entire 1980 Act, it is that one of Congress’\nprimary purposes was to bring United States refugee law into\nconformance with the 1967 United Nations Protocol Relating\nto  the  Status  of  Refugees.”    INS  v.  Cardoza-Fonseca,\n480 U.S. 421, 436 (1987).  The 1980 Act included, among\nother things, a provision designed to implement Article 33 of\nthe 1951 Convention.  After recounting the history behind\n8 U.S.C. § 1253(h)(1), part of the 1980 Act, the Supreme\nCourt characterized that section as “parallel[ing] Article 33,”\nthe anti-refoulement provision of the 1951 Convention.  INS\nv. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. 415, 427 (1999).\nSection  1253(h)(1)  provided,  in  relevant  part,  “The\nAttorney General shall not deport or return any alien . . . to\na country if the Attorney General determines that such alien’s\nlife or freedom would be threatened in such country on\naccount  of  race,  religion,  nationality,  membership  of  a\nparticular social group, or political opinion.”  Id. at 419\n(emphasis added).  The current version is § 1231(b)(3)(A): \n“[T]he  Attorney  General  may  not  remove  an  alien  to  a\ncountry if the Attorney General decides that the alien’s life or\nfreedom would be threatened in that country because of the\nalien’s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular\nsocial group, or political opinion.”  (Emphasis added.)  The\nwords “deport or return” in the 1980 version of the section\nwere replaced in 1996 by “remove” as part of a general\nstatutory  revision  under  IIRIRA.    Throughout  IIRIRA,\n“removal” became the new all-purpose word, encompassing\n“deportation,” “exclusion,” and “return” in the earlier statute. \nSee, e.g., Salgado-Diaz v. Gonzales, 395 F.3d 1158, 1162 (9th\nCir.  2005)  (“IIRIRA  eliminated  the  distinction  between\ndeportation and exclusion proceedings, replacing them with\na new, consolidated category—‘removal.’”).\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 37 of 57\nINNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF 37\nPlaintiffs point out several features of the MPP that, in\ntheir  view,  provide  insufficient  protection  against\nrefoulement.\nFirst, under the MPP, to stay in the United States during\nthe pendency of removal proceedings under § 1229a, the\nasylum seeker must show that it is “more likely than not” that\nhe or she will be persecuted in Mexico.  More-likely-than-not\nis a high standard, ordinarily applied only after an alien has\nhad a regular removal hearing under § 1229a.  By contrast,\nthe standard ordinarily applied in screening interviews with\nasylum officers at the border is much lower.  Aliens subject\nto expedited removal need only establish a “credible fear” in\norder to remain in the United States pending a hearing under\n§ 1229a.  §§ 1225(b)(1)(A)(ii), 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii).  Credible\nfear  requires  only  that  the  alien  show  a  “significant\npossibility” of persecution.  § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v).\nSecond, under the MPP, an asylum seeker is not entitled\nto advance notice of, and time to prepare for, the hearing with\nthe asylum officer; to advance notice of the criteria the\nasylum officer will use; to the assistance of a lawyer during\nthe  hearing;  or  to  any  review  of  the  asylum  officer’s\ndetermination.  By contrast, an asylum seeker in a removal\nproceeding under § 1229a is entitled to advance notice of the\nhearing with sufficient time to prepare; to advance notice of\nthe precise charge or charges on which removal is sought; to\nthe assistance of a lawyer; to an appeal to the Board of\nImmigration Appeals; and to a subsequent petition for review\nto the court of appeals.\nThird, an asylum officer acting under the MPP does not\nask an asylum seeker whether he or she fears returning to\nMexico.  Instead, asylum seekers must volunteer, without any\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 38 of 57\n38 INNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF\nprompting,  that they  fear returning.   By contrast,  under\nexisting regulations, an asylum officer conducting a credible\nfear interview is directed “to elicit all relevant and useful\ninformation bearing on whether the applicant has a credible\nfear of persecution or torture.”  8 C.F.R. § 208.30(d).  The\nasylum officer is specifically directed to “determine that the\nalien has an understanding of the credible fear determination\nprocess.”  § 208.30(d)(2).\nThe Government disagrees with plaintiffs based on two\narguments.    The  Government  first  argues  briefly  that\n§  1231(b)(3)(A)  does  not  encompass  a  general  anti-\nrefoulement obligation.  It argues that the protection provided\nby § 1231(b)(3)(A) applies to aliens only after they have been\nordered removed to their home country at the conclusion of\na regular removal proceeding under § 1229a.  It writes:\nSection  1231(b)(3)  codifies  a  form  of\nprotection from removal that is available only\nafter an alien is adjudged removable.  See\n8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3); 8 C.F.R.  1208.16(a). \nAliens subject to MPP do not receive a final\norder of removal to their home country when\nthey are returned (temporarily) to Mexico, and\nso there is no reason why the same procedures\nwould apply . . . .\nBlue Brief at 41 (emphasis in original).\nThe Government reads § 1231(b)(3)(A) too narrowly. \nSection 1231(b)(3)(A) does indeed apply to regular removal\nproceedings under § 1229a, as evidenced, for example, by\n8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(a) (discussing, inter alia, the role of the\nImmigration Judge).  But its application is not limited to such\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 39 of 57\nINNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF 39\nproceedings.  As described above, and as recognized by the\nSupreme  Court,  Congress  intended  §  1253(h)(1),  and\n§ 1231(b)(3)(A) as its recodified successor, to “parallel”\nArticle  33  of  the  1951  Convention.    Aguirre-Aguirre,\n526 U.S. at 427.  Article 33 is a general anti-refoulement\nprovision, applicable whenever an alien might be returned to\na  country  where  his  or  her  life  or  freedom  might  be\nthreatened on account of a protected ground.  It is not limited\nto instances in which an alien has had a full removal hearing\nwith significant procedural protections, as would be the case\nunder § 1229a.\nThe Government’s second argument is that the MPP\nsatisfies  our anti-refoulement obligations  by providing  a\nsufficiently effective method of determining whether aliens\nfear, or have reason to fear, returning to Mexico.  In its brief,\nthe Government contends that asylum seekers who genuinely\nfear returning to Mexico have “every incentive” affirmatively\nto raise that fear during their interviews with asylum officers,\nand that Mexico is not a dangerous place for non-Mexican\nasylum seekers.  The Government writes:\n[N]one  of  the  aliens  subject  to  MPP  are\nMexican nationals fleeing Mexico, and all of\nthem voluntarily chose to enter and spend\ntime in Mexico en route to the United States. \nMexico, moreover, has committed to adhering\nto its domestic and international obligations\nregarding  refugees.    Those  considerations\ntogether  strongly  suggest  that  the  great\nmajority of aliens subject to MPP are not\nmore likely than not to face persecution on a\nprotected ground or torture, in Mexico.  In the\nrare case where an MPP-eligible alien does\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 40 of 57\n40 INNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF\nhave a substantial and well-grounded basis for\nclaiming that he is likely to be persecuted in\nMexico, that alien will have every incentive to\nraise that fear at the moment he is told that he\nwill be returned.\nBlue Brief at 45.  However, the Government points to no\nevidence  supporting  its  speculations  either  that  aliens,\nunprompted and untutored in the law of refoulement, will\nvolunteer that they fear returning to Mexico, or that there is\nlittle danger to non-Mexican aliens in Mexico.\nThe Government further asserts, again without supporting\nevidence,  that  any  violence  that  returned  aliens  face  in\nMexico is unlikely to be violence on account of a protected\nground—that is, violence that constitutes persecution.  The\nGovernment writes:\n[T]he basic logic of the contiguous-territory-\nreturn statute is that aliens generally do not\nface persecution on account of a protected\nstatus, or torture, in the country from which\nthey happen to arrive by land, as opposed to\nthe home country from which they may have\nfled.  (International law guards against torture\nand persecution on account of a protected\nground,  not  random  acts  of  crime  or\ngeneralized violence.)\nBlue Brief at 40–41 (emphasis in original).\nPlaintiffs, who are aliens returned to Mexico under the\nMPP,  presented  sworn  declarations  to  the  district  court\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 41 of 57\nINNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF 41\ndirectly contradicting the unsupported speculations of the\nGovernment.\nSeveral  declarants  described  violence  and  threats  of\nviolence in Mexico.  Much of the violence was directed at the\ndeclarants because they were non-Mexican—that is, because\nof their nationality, a protected ground under asylum law. \nGregory Doe wrote in his declaration:\nI did not feel safe at Benito Juarez [a\nmigrant shelter] because the neighbors kept\ntrying to attack the migrant community.  The\npeople who lived near the shelter tried to hurt\nus  because  they  did  not  want  us  in  their\ncountry. . . .\nAt El Barretal [another migrant shelter], I\nfelt a little more secure because we had a high\nwall  surrounding  us.

Frank\nDoe wrote:\nHe never asked me if I was afraid of returning\nto Mexico.  At one point, I had to interrupt\nhim  to  explain  that  I  didn’t  feel  safe  in\nMexico.

Migrants in\nTijuana  are  always  in  danger,  and  I  am\nespecially afraid because the Zetas torture\npeople who escape them.\nDespite having told their asylum officers that they feared\nreturning, Frank Doe and Howard Doe were returned to\nMexico.\nThis evidence in the record is enough—indeed, far more\nthan enough—to establish that the Government’s speculations\nhave no factual basis.  Amici in this case have filed briefs\nbolstering this already more-than-sufficient evidence.  For\nexample, Amnesty International USA, the Washington Office\non Latin America, the Latin America Working Group, and the\nInstitute for Women in Migration submitted an amicus brief\nreferencing many reliable news reports corroborating the\nstories told by the declarants.  We referenced several of those\nreports earlier in our opinion.\nLocal 1924 of the American Federation of Government\nEmployees,  a  labor  organization  representing  “men  and\nwomen  who  operate  USCIS  Asylum  Pre-Screening\nOperation, which has been responsible for a large part of\nUSCIS’s ‘credible fear’ and ‘reasonable fear’ screenings, and\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 48 of 57\n48 INNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF\nfor implementing [the MPP],” also submitted an amicus brief. \nLocal 1924 Amicus Brief at 1.  Local 1924 writes in its brief:\nAsylum officers are duty bound to protect\nvulnerable asylum seekers from persecution. \nHowever, under the MPP, they face a conflict\nbetween the directives of their departmental\nleaders to follow the MPP and adherence to\nour  Nation’s  legal  commitment  to  not\nreturning the persecuted to a territory where\nthey will face persecution.  They should not\nbe forced to honor departmental directives\nthat are fundamentally contrary to the moral\nfabric of our Nation and our international and\ndomestic legal obligations.\nId. at 24.\nBased on the Supreme Court’s conclusion that Congress\nintended in § 1253(h)(1) (the predecessor to § 1231(b)(3)(B))\nto “parallel” the anti-refoulement provision of Article 33 of\nthe 1951 Convention, and based on the record in the district\ncourt, we conclude that plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits of their claim that the MPP does not\ncomply with the United States’ anti-refoulement obligations\nunder § 1231(b).  We need not, and do not, reach the question\nwhether the part of the MPP challenged as inconsistent with\nour anti-refoulement obligations should have been adopted\nthrough notice-and-comment rulemaking.\nVI.  Other Preliminary Injunction Factors\nIn addition to likelihood of success on the merits, a court\nmust consider the likelihood that the requesting party will\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 49 of 57\nINNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF 49\nsuffer irreparable harm, the balance of the equities, and the\npublic  interest  in  determining  whether  a  preliminary\ninjunction is justified.  Winter, 555 U.S. at 20.  “When the\ngovernment is a party, these last two factors merge.”  Drakes\nBay Oyster Co. v. Jewell, 747 F.3d 1073, 1092 (9th Cir. 2014)\n(citing Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009)).\nThere  is  a  significant  likelihood  that  the  individual\nplaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the MPP is not\nenjoined.  Uncontested evidence in the record establishes that\nnon-Mexicans  returned  to  Mexico  under  the  MPP  risk\nsubstantial harm, even death, while they await adjudication of\ntheir applications for asylum.\nThe balance of equities favors plaintiffs.  On one side is\nthe interest of the Government in continuing to follow the\ndirectives of the MPP.  However, the strength of that interest\nis diminished by the likelihood, established above, that the\nMPP is inconsistent with 8 U.S.C. §§ 1225(b) and 1231(b). \nOn  the  other  side  is  the  interest  of  the  plaintiffs.    The\nindividual plaintiffs risk substantial harm, even death, so long\nas  the  directives  of  the  MPP  are  followed,  and  the\norganizational plaintiffs are hindered in their ability to carry\nout their missions.\nThe public interest similarly favors the plaintiffs.  We\nagree with East Bay Sanctuary Covenant:\nOn the one hand, the public has a “weighty”\ninterest  “in  efficient  administration  of  the\nimmigration laws at the border.”  Landon v.\nPlasencia, 459 U.S. 21, 34 (1982).  But the\npublic also has an interest in ensuring that\n“statutes enacted by [their] representatives”\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 50 of 57\n50 INNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF\nare not imperiled by executive fiat.  Maryland\nv. King, 567 U.S. 1301, 1301 (2012) (Roberts,\nC.J., in chambers).\n932 F.3d at 779 (alteration in original).\nVII.  Scope of the Injunction\nThe district court issued a preliminary injunction setting\naside the MPP—that is, enjoining the Government “from\ncontinuing to implement or expand the ‘Migrant Protection\nProtocols’ as announced in the January 25, 2018 DHS policy\nmemorandum  and  as  explicated  in  further  agency\nmemoranda.”  Innovation Law Lab, 366 F. Supp. 3d at 1130. \nAccepting for purposes of argument that some injunction\nshould issue, the Government objects to its scope.\nWe recognize that nationwide injunctions have become\nincreasingly controversial, but we begin by noting that it is\nsomething of a misnomer to call the district court’s order in\nthis case a “nationwide injunction.”  The MPP operates only\nat our southern border and directs the actions of government\nofficials only in the four States along that border.  Two of\nthose states (California and Arizona) are in the Ninth Circuit. \nOne of those states (New Mexico) is in the Tenth Circuit. \nOne of those states (Texas) is in the Fifth Circuit.  In practical\neffect, the district court’s injunction, while setting aside the\nMPP in its entirety, does not operate nationwide.\nFor two mutually reinforcing reasons, we conclude that\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion in setting aside\nthe MPP.\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 51 of 57\nINNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF 51\nFirst,  plaintiffs  have  challenged  the  MPP  under  the\nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”).  Section 706(2)(A)\nof the APA provides that a “reviewing court shall . . . hold\nunlawful and set aside agency action . . . not in accordance\nwith  law.”    We  held,  above,  that  the  MPP  is  “not  in\naccordance with” 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b).  Section 706(2)(A)\ndirects that in a case where, as here, a reviewing court has\nfound the agency action “unlawful,” the court “shall . . . set\naside  [the]  agency  action.”    That  is,  in  a  case  where\n§ 706(2)(A) applies, there is a statutory directive—above and\nbeyond the underlying statutory obligation asserted in the\nlitigation—telling a reviewing court that its obligation is to\n“set aside” any unlawful agency action.\nThere is a presumption (often unstated) in APA cases that\nthe offending agency action should be set aside in its entirety\nrather than only in limited geographical areas.  “[W]hen a\nreviewing  court  determines  that  agency  regulations  are\nunlawful, the ordinary result is that rules are vacated—not\nthat  their  application  to  the  individual  petitioners  is\nproscribed.”  Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. U.S. Dep’t of\nHomeland Sec., 908 F3d 476, 511 (9th Cir. 2018) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).  “When a court determines that an\nagency’s action failed to follow Congress’s clear mandate the\nappropriate remedy is to vacate that action.”  Cal. Wilderness\nCoalition v. U.S. Dep’t of Energy, 631 F.3d 1072, 1095 (9th\nCir. 2011); see also United Steel v. Mine Safety & Health\nAdmin., 925 F.3d 1279, 1287 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (“The ordinary\npractice is to vacate unlawful agency action.”); Gen. Chem.\nCorp. v. United States, 817 F.2d 844, 848 (D.C. Cir. 1987)\n(“The APA requires us to vacate the agency’s decision if it is\n‘arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not\nin accordance with law . . . .”).\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 52 of 57\n52 INNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF\nSecond, cases implicating immigration policy have a\nparticularly strong claim for uniform relief.  Federal law\ncontemplates a “comprehensive and unified” immigration\npolicy.  Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 401 (2012). \n“In immigration matters, we have consistently recognized the\nauthority of district courts to enjoin unlawful policies on a\nuniversal basis.”  E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant, 932 F.3d\nat 779.  We wrote in Regents of the University of California,\n908 F.3d at 511,  “A final principle is also relevant:  the need\nfor uniformity in immigration policy. . . .  Allowing uneven\napplication of nationwide immigration policy flies in the face\nof these requirements.”  We wrote to the same effect in\nHawaii v. Trump, 878 F.3d 662, 701 (9th Cir. 2017), rev’d on\nother grounds, 138 S. Ct. 2392 (2018):  “Because this case\nimplicates immigration policy, a nationwide injunction was\nnecessary to give Plaintiffs a full expression of their rights.” \nThe Fifth Circuit, one of only two other federal circuits with\nstates along our southern border, has held that nationwide\ninjunctions  are  appropriate  in  immigration  cases.    In\nsustaining a nationwide injunction in an immigration case, the\nFifth Circuit wrote, “[T]he Constitution requires ‘an uniform\nRule of Naturalization’; Congress has instructed that ‘the\nimmigration laws of the United States should be enforced\nvigorously  and  uniformly’;  and  the  Supreme  Court  has\ndescribed  immigration  policy  as  ‘a  comprehensive  and\nunified system.’” Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134,\n187–88  (5th  Cir.  2015)  (emphasis  in  original;  citations\nomitted).  In Washington v. Trump, 847 F.3d 1151 (9th Cir.\n2017), we relied on the Fifth Circuit’s decision in Texas to\nsustain the nationwide scope of a temporary restraining order\nin an immigration case.  We wrote, “[W]e decline to limit the\ngeographic scope of the TRO.  The Fifth Circuit has held that\nsuch a fragmented immigration policy would run afoul of the\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 53 of 57\nINNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF 53\nconstitutional  and  statutory  requirement  for  uniform\nimmigration law and policy.”  Id. at 1166–67.\nConclusion\nWe conclude that the MPP is inconsistent with 8 U.S.C.\n§ 1225(b), and that it is inconsistent in part with 8 U.S.C.\n§ 1231(b).  Because the MPP is invalid in its entirety due to\nits inconsistency with § 1225(b), it should be enjoined in its\nentirety.  Because plaintiffs have successfully challenged the\nMPP under § 706(2)(A) of the APA, and because the MPP\ndirectly  affects  immigration  into  this  country  along  our\nsouthern  border,  the  issuance  of  a  temporary  injunction\nsetting aside the MPP was not an abuse of discretion.\nWe lift the emergency stay imposed by the motions panel,\nand we affirm the decision of the district court.\nAFFIRMED.\nFERNANDEZ, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion because\nI believe that we are bound by the published decision in\nInnovation Law Lab v. McAleenan (Innovation I), 924 F.3d\n503 (9th Cir. 2019) (per curiam).\nMore specifically, we are bound by both the law of the\ncircuit and the law of the case.  Of course, the rules that\nanimate the former doctrine are not the same as those that\nanimate the latter.  See Gonzalez v. Arizona, 677 F.3d 383,\n389 n.4 (9th Cir. 2012) (en banc).\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 54 of 57\n54 INNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF\nAs we have said: “Circuit law . . . binds all courts within\na particular circuit, including the court of appeals itself. \nThus, the first panel to consider an issue sets the law not only\nfor all the inferior courts in the circuit, but also future panels\nof the court of appeals.”  Hart v. Massanari, 266 F.3d 1155,\n1171 (9th Cir. 2001).  Moreover: “Once a panel resolves an\nissue in a precedential opinion, the matter is deemed resolved,\nunless overruled by the court itself sitting en banc, or by the\nSupreme Court.”  Id. (footnote omitted).  Published opinions\nare precedential.  See id. at 1177; see also Gonzalez, 667 F.3d\nat 389 n.4.  That remains true, even if some later panel is\nsatisfied that “arguments have been characterized differently\nor more persuasively by a new litigant,”1 or even if a later\npanel is convinced that the earlier decision was “incorrectly\ndecided” and “needs reexamination.”2  And those rules are\nnot mere formalities to be nodded to and avoided.  Rather,\n“[i]nsofar as there may be factual differences between the\ncurrent case and the earlier one, the court must determine\nwhether those differences are material to the application of\nthe rule or allow the precedent to be distinguished on a\nprincipled basis.”  Hart, 266 F.3d at 1172.  In this case, there\nare no material differences — in fact, the situation before this\npanel is in every material way the same as that before the\nmotions panel.  Furthermore, there is no doubt that motions\npanels can publish their opinions,3 even though they do not\ngenerally do so.4  Once published, there is no difference\n1 United States v. Ramos-Medina, 706 F.3d 932, 939 (9th Cir. 2013).\n2 Naruto v. Slater, 888 F.3d 418, 425 n.7 (9th Cir. 2018).\n3 See 9th Cir. Gen. Order 6.3(g)(3)(ii); see also id. at 6.4(b).\n4 See Haggard v. Curry, 631 F.3d 931, 933 n.1 (9th Cir. 2010) (per\ncuriam).\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 55 of 57\nINNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF 55\nbetween motions panel opinions and other opinions; all are\nentitled  to  be  considered  with  the  same  principles  of\ndeference by ensuing panels.  Thus, any hesitation about\nwhether they should be precedential must necessarily come\nbefore the panel decides to publish, not after.  As we held in\nLair v. Bullock, 798 F.3d 736 (9th Cir. 2015):\nLair  contended  at  oral  argument  that  a\nmotions panel’s decision cannot bind a merits\npanel, and as a result we are not bound by the\nmotions panel’s analysis in this case.  Not so. \nWe have held that motions panels can issue\npublished decisions.  . . . [W]e are bound by a\nprior three-judge panel’s published opinions,\nand a motions panel’s published opinion binds\nfuture  panels  the  same  as  does  a  merits\npanel’s published opinion.\nId.  at  747  (citations  omitted).    Therefore,  the  legal\ndeterminations in Innovation I are the law of the circuit.\nWe have explained the law of the case doctrine as “a\njurisprudential doctrine under which an appellate court does\nnot reconsider matters resolved on a prior appeal.”  Jeffries v.\nWood, 114 F.3d 1484, 1488–89 (9th Cir. 1997) (en banc),\noverruled on other grounds by Gonzalez, 677 F.3d at 389 n.4. \nWhile we do have discretion to decline application of the\ndoctrine, “[t]he prior decision should be followed unless:\n(1) the decision is clearly erroneous and its enforcement\nwould work a manifest injustice, (2) intervening controlling\nauthority  makes  reconsideration  appropriate,  or\n(3)  substantially  different  evidence  was  adduced  at  a\nsubsequent trial.”  Id. at 1489 (internal quotation marks and\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00807-RS   Document 107   Filed 02/28/20   Page 56 of 57\n56 INNOVATION LAW LAB V. WOLF\nfootnote omitted).5  We have also indicated that, in general,\n“our decisions at the preliminary injunction phase do not\nconstitute the law of the case,”6 but that is principally because\nthe matter is at the preliminary injunction stage and a further\ndevelopment of the factual record as the case progresses to its\nconclusion may well require a change in the result.7  Even so,\ndecisions “on pure issues of law . . .  are binding.”  Ranchers\nCattlemen, 499 F.3d at 1114.  Of course, the case at hand has\nnot progressed beyond the preliminary injunction stage.  It is\nstill at that stage, and the factual record has not significantly\nchanged between the record at the time of the decision\nregarding the stay motion and the current record.  Therefore,\nas I see it, absent one of the listed exceptions, which I do not\nperceive to be involved here, the law of the case doctrine\nwould also direct that we are bound by much of the motions\npanel’s decision in Innovation I.\nApplying those doctrines:\n(1) The individuals and the organizational plaintiffs are\nnot  likely  to  succeed  on  the  substantive  claim  that  the\nMigrant Protection Protocols directive (the MPP) was not\n5 The majority seems to add a fourth exception, that is, motions panel\ndecisions never constitute the law of the case.
