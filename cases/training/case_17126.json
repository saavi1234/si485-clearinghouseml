    "summary": "<p>The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) requires the government to obtain a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) before it may conduct any domestic electronic surveillance to acquire foreign intelligence information. The warrant applications are made ex parte and must include a sworn statement by a federal officer of the facts and circumstances relied upon to justify the government's belief that the target of surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power. Once a FISC judge receives a warrant application, the judge can order approval of the surveillance only if the judge finds that there is probable cause to believe that the target of the electronic surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power. Because the orders only authorize surveillance up to 90 days, the government must file an application for an extension that meets the same requirements as the initial warrant application and obtain a renewal order from the FISC for continued surveillance. For the Civil Rights Litigation Clearinghouse collection of FISA matters, see our <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/results.php?searchSpecialCollection=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">special collection</a>.</p>\r\n<p>On January 29, 2018, during the Trump administration, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) voted to disclose a memorandum (the Nunes Memo) revealing existence of a FISA warrant for the electronic surveillance of Carter Page, who served as a onetime foreign policy advisor to the Trump Campaign until September 2016. The Nunes Memo was declassified by President Donald Trump on February 2, 2018. The Nunes Memo revealed that on October 21, 2016, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) sought and received a probable cause order from the FISC authorizing electronic surveillance on Carter Page. The Nunes Memo further disclosed that in addition to the initial warrant application, the government had received three renewal orders from the FISC. The initial warrant application and the three renewal orders were eventually disclosed by the Department of Justice on July 21, 2018. See <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17114\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">In re Carter W. Page, a U.S. Person.</a></p>\r\n<p>On May 3, 2018, Judicial Watch filed a FOIA complaint against the Department of Justice (DOJ) seeking transcripts of any hearings related to Carter Page. The complaint alleged that Judicial Watch had submitted a FOIA request to the DOJ on February 16, 2018, but that as of May 3, 2018, the DOJ had failed to either produce the requested records or respond to them. On June 18, 2018, Judicial Watch received a letter from the DOJ stating that the DOJ did not have \"any records responsive\" to Judicial Watch's request. On August 30, 2018, the DOJ filed a motion for summary judgment, stating that the National Security Division (NSD), which maintains operational files regarding the FISC, \"searched the locations likely to contain responsive records and reasonably determined that there are no responsive records.\" Furthermore, the DOJ maintained that its FOIA staff had consulted with subject matter experts in the Office of Intelligence who confirmed that, \"as is typical in proceedings before the FISC, no hearings were held with respect to the acknowledged Carter Page FISA applications, and thus no responsive transcripts exist.\"</p>\r\n<p>On September 24, 2018, in light of the fact that the DOJ did not have any responsive transcripts, the parties stipulated to the dismissal of this action with prejudice. The case is now closed. However, on July 25, 2018, after receiving the DOJ's letter, Judicial Watch filed a motion with the FISC for publication of all transcripts related to Carter Page. As of February 2019, there has been no other activity in this matter that has been publicly disclosed. See <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17122\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Misc. 18-03.</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

See 5 U.S.C. § 552(c) (2006 & \nSupp. IV (2010).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of \nthe FOIA.  This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be \ntaken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \nThe National Security Division (NSD) maintains operational files which document \nrequests to and approvals from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of authority for the \nU.S. Intelligence Community to conduct certain foreign intelligence activities. \nWe do not search these records in response to requests regarding the use or non-use of \nsuch techniques in cases where the confirmation or denial of the existence of responsive records \nwould, in and of itself, reveal information properly classified under Executive Order 13526.  To \nconfirm or deny the existence of such materials in each case would tend to reveal properly \nclassified information regarding whether particular surveillance techniques have or have not \nbeen used by the U.S. Intelligence Community.  Accordingly, with respect to your request \nrelating to Michael Flynn, ·we can neither confirm nor deny the existence of records in these files \nresponsive to your request pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(l). \nBased on declassification decisions by the President and the Intelligence Community, \nhowever, we are able to respond to your request relating to Carter Page.  A search ofNSD's \nrecords did not identify any records responsive to your request. \n\nAs this request is in litigation, we are omitting our standard administrative appeal \nparagraph. \nSincerely, \nr::::~~~ \nRecords and FOIA Unit \n2 ",

This matter arises from a FOIA request submitted to the Department of Justice for \n“transcripts of hearings before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court regarding applications \nfor or renewals of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (“FISA”) warrants relating to Carter \nPage and/or Michael Flynn.”  See Declaration of Patrick Findlay, ¶ 4 & Ex. A.  The request is \ndated February 16, 2018, and was received by DOJ on February 26, 2018.  Id.  It was later \nreferred to the National Security Division.  Id. ¶ 5. \n2.  By letter dated June 18, 2018, NSD made a final determination.  The letter \ndescribed NSD’s operational files and responded that “with respect to your request relating to \nMichael Flynn, we can neither confirm nor deny the existence of records in these files responsive \nto your request.”  Findlay Decl. ¶ 6 & Ex. B.  NSD further determined that “based on \ndeclassification decisions . . . we are able to respond to your request relating to Carter Page,” and \nconfirmed that NSD found no records responsive to the request.  Id. \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01050-ABJ   Document 8   Filed 08/30/18   Page 3 of 27\n3.  On February 2, 2018, Congress released a memorandum, hereinafter referred to as \nthe “Nunes Memorandum.”  The President declassified the Congressional memorandum, which \nincluded references to the existence of FISA material related to Carter Page.  A letter from White \nHouse counsel clarified that it was declassified “in light of the significant public interest” in the \nmatter and noted that the memorandum “reflects the judgments of its congressional authors.”  On \nFebruary 24, 2018, HPSCI’s Democratic Members released a redacted memorandum authored \nby Adam Schiff, ranking member of HPSCI, to “correct the record” following release of the \nNunes Memorandum (hereafter “the Schiff Memorandum”).  In light of the declassification of \nthe Nunes Memorandum and subsequent publication of the Schiff Memorandum, the Department \nofficially acknowledged the existence of FISA applications related to Carter Page after his \nseparation from the Trump campaign.   Findlay Decl. ¶¶ 7-8. \n4.  Other than the declassification of portions of these Carter Page materials, \nDepartment has not official confirmed or denied the existence of any other FISA material related \nto the Trump campaign or the investigation of Russian election interference.  Findlay Decl. ¶¶ 9, \n19. \n5.  With respect to the portion of the request related to Carter Page, NSD searched \nthe locations likely to contain responsive records and reasonably determined that there are no \nresponsive records.  Findlay Decl. ¶¶ 13-15. \n6.  Specifically, FOIA staff consulted with knowledgeable subject matter experts in \nthe Office of Intelligence.  Those experts confirmed that, as is typical in proceedings before the \nFISC, no hearings were held with respect to the acknowledged Carter Page FISA applications, \nand thus no responsive transcripts exist.   Id.  ¶ 14.   \n7.  Patrick Findlay is an original classification authority.  Id.  ¶ 2.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01050-ABJ   Document 8   Filed 08/30/18   Page 4 of 27\n8.  With respect to the portion of the request related to Michael Flynn, Mr. Findlay \ndetermined that the existence or nonexistence of responsive records is a currently and properly \nclassified fact and therefore properly withheld under Exemption One.  Findlay Decl. ¶¶ 16-33. \n9.  Mr. Findlay determined that the information withheld pursuant to Exemption 1 is \nunder control of the United States Government, and contains information pertaining to \nintelligence activities, sources or methods.  See Executive Order 13526 §§ 1.4(c); Findlay Decl. \n¶¶ 26-28. \n10.  Mr. Findlay determined that disclosure of the existence or non-existence of \nresponsive records with respect to this portion of the request would cause harm to national \nsecurity, and has articulated the harm that could be expected to occur.  Findlay Decl. ¶¶ 28-32. \n11.  No authorized Executive Branch official has disclosed the information withheld in \nthis matter.

More specifically, they seek \ntranscripts of hearings before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (“FISC”) related to \nalleged surveillance of two specific individuals:  Carter Page or Michael Flynn.  The Department \nof Justice (“DOJ”) National Security Division (“NSD”) confirmed that there are no records \nrelated to Carter Page subject to the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”).  Otherwise, NSD \nproperly refused to confirm or deny the existence of responsive records, and no authorized \nExecutive Branch official has disclosed the specific information at issue – namely, the existence \nor non-existence of FISC transcripts (or applications) related to Michael Flynn.   \nThe partial “no records” response is proper.  The Government’s supporting declarations \nestablish that the FISC typically considers FISA warrant applications based on written \nsubmissions and may decide matters without holding a hearing.  In light of recent public \ndisclosures about Carter Page, NSD confirms that it has conducted a reasonable search and that \nno such hearings were held with respect to the acknowledged FISA applications.  Accordingly, \nno responsive hearing transcripts exist, and the partial “no records” response was proper.   \nWith respect to Michael Flynn, the Glomar response, in which DOJ does not confirm or \ndeny the existence of responsive transcripts, is proper.  Providing a substantive response as to \nwhether or not responsive hearing transcripts exist would reveal classified information protected \nby FOIA Exemption 1, including whether or not the Government sought a FISA warrant for \nMichael Flynn.  NSD’s declaration establishes that this information is currently and properly \nclassified, and its disclosure would cause harm to national security.  The Court should defer to \nDefendant’s determination in this regard and grant the Government summary judgment. \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01050-ABJ   Document 8   Filed 08/30/18   Page 12 of 27\nBACKGROUND \n \n  Administrative Background. \nThis matter arises from a FOIA request submitted to the Department of Justice for \n“transcripts of hearings before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court regarding applications \nfor or renewals of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (“FISA”) warrants relating to Carter \nPage and/or Michael Flynn.”  See Declaration of Patrick Findlay, attached hereto, ¶ 4 & Ex. A.  \nThe request is dated February 16, 2018, and was received by DOJ on February 26, 2018.  Id.  \nThe Mail Referral Unit referred it to NSD.1  Findlay Decl. ¶ 5. \nBy letter dated June 18, 2018, NSD described its operational files and responded that \n“with respect to your request relating to Michael Flynn, we can neither confirm nor deny the \nexistence of records in these files responsive to your request.”  Findlay Decl. ¶ 6 & Ex. B.  NSD \nfurther determined that “based on declassification decisions . . . we are able to respond to your \nrequest relating to Carter Page,” and confirmed that NSD found no records responsive to the \nrequest.  Id. \nOn May 3, 2018, before NSD had made a final determination on the FOIA request, \nPlaintiff filed a Complaint, seeking production of documents, fees and costs.  Compl., Dkt. No. \n1. \n  \n                                                           \n1 Rather than being directed to any particular component, the request was sent to the Department \nMail Referral Unit.  See Findlay Decl. ¶ 4; see generally 28 C.F.R. §16.3(a)(1), (2); DOJ FOIA \nReference Guide, Pt. III: Where to Make a FOIA Request (Jan. 30, 2017), available at \nhttps://www.justice.gov/oip/department-justice-freedom-information-act-reference-guide#where \n(permitting submission of requests to the Mail Referral Unit “[i]f you believe that DOJ maintains \nthe records you are seeking, but you are uncertain about which component has the records”).  \nThe regulations advise that “[a] request will receive the quickest possible response if it is \naddressed to the FOIA office of the component that maintains the records sought.”  28 C.F.R. \n§16.3(a)(1). \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01050-ABJ   Document 8   Filed 08/30/18   Page 13 of 27\n  Russia Investigation and FISA Applications Related to Carter Page \nPlaintiff’s FOIA request arises in a factual context in which there is an ongoing, \nacknowledged official investigation related to the Trump campaign.  Specifically, the FBI has \nacknowledged a counterintelligence investigation of “the Russian government’s efforts to \ninterfere in the 2016 presidential election[, including] the nature of any links between individuals \nassociated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any \ncoordination between the campaign and Russia’s efforts [and] an assessment of whether any \ncrimes were committed.”  See Transcript of the House Permanent Select Committee on \nIntelligence Hearing on Russian Interference in the 2016 U.S. Election, March 20, 2017, \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/03/20/full-transcript-fbi-director-\njames-comey-testifies-on-russian-interference-in-2016-election/?utm_term=.b9f19a0cf9cf (last \naccessed 8/27/2018).  That investigation is now under the direction of Special Counsel Robert \nMueller.  See Office of the Dep. Att’y General, Order No. 3915-2017, Appointment of Special \nCounsel to Investigate Russian Interference with the 2016 Presidential Election and Related \nMatters (May 17, 2017), https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/967231/download.  \nMultiple guilty pleas have resulted from that investigation, including that of Michael Flynn.  See \ngenerally U.S. v. Flynn, Case No. 1:17-cr-00232-RC (D.D.C.). \nOn February 2, 2018, Congress released a memorandum, hereinafter referred to as the \n“Nunes Memorandum.”  The President declassified the Congressional memorandum, which \nincluded references to the existence of FISA applications and orders related to Carter Page.  \nFindlay Decl. ¶ 7.  A letter from White House counsel clarified that it was declassified “in light \nof the significant public interest” in the matter and noted that the memorandum “reflects the \njudgments of its congressional authors.”  On February 24, 2018, HPSCI’s Democratic Members \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01050-ABJ   Document 8   Filed 08/30/18   Page 14 of 27\nreleased a redacted memorandum authored by Adam Schiff, ranking member of HPSCI, to \n“correct the record” following release of the Nunes Memorandum (hereafter “the Schiff \nMemorandum”).  Id.  In light of the declassification of the Nunes Memorandum and subsequent \npublication of the Schiff Memorandum, the Department officially acknowledged the existence of \nFISA applications and orders related to Carter Page after his separation from the Trump \ncampaign.2  Id. ¶¶ 8-9.  Other than the declassification of portions of these Carter Page materials, \nDOJ has not official confirmed or denied the existence of any other FISA applications and orders \nrelated to other individuals in connection with the investigation of Russian election interference. \nARGUMENT \n \nI.  Statutory Standards.  \n \nA.  The Freedom of Information Act  \n \nThe “basic purpose” of FOIA reflects a “general philosophy of full agency disclosure \nunless information is exempted under clearly delineated statutory language.” John Doe Agency v. \nJohn Doe Corp., 493 U.S. 146, 152 (1989) (citation omitted).  “Congress recognized, however, \nthat public disclosure is not always in the public interest . . . .”  CIA v. Sims, 471 U.S. 159, 166–\n67 (1985).  Accordingly, in passing FOIA, “Congress sought ‘to reach a workable balance \nbetween the right of the public to know and the need of the Government to keep information in \nconfidence to the extent necessary without permitting indiscriminate secrecy.’”  John Doe \nAgency, 493 U.S. at 152 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 89-1497, at 6 (1966), reprinted in 1966 \nU.S.C.C.A.N. 2418, 2423).  As the D.C. Circuit has recognized, “FOIA represents a balance \nstruck by Congress between the public’s right to know and the [G]overnment’s legitimate \n                                                           \n2 Those applications and orders have since been processed and released by the Department in \nresponse to several pending FOIA requests. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01050-ABJ   Document 8   Filed 08/30/18   Page 15 of 27\ninterest in keeping certain information confidential.”  Ctr. for Nat’l Sec. Studies v. Dep’t of \nJustice, 331 F.3d 918, 925 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (citing John Doe Agency, 493 U.S. at 152).  \nFOIA mandates disclosure of government records unless the requested information falls \nwithin one of nine enumerated exemptions.  See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b).  “A district court only has \njurisdiction to compel an agency to disclose improperly withheld agency records,” i.e. records \nthat do “not fall within an exemption.”  Minier v. CIA, 88 F.3d 796, 803 (9th Cir. 1996); see also \n5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B) (providing the district court with jurisdiction only “to enjoin the agency \nfrom withholding agency records and to order the production of any agency records improperly \nwithheld from the complainant”); Kissinger v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press, 445 \nU.S. 136, 150 (1980) (“Under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B)[,] federal jurisdiction is dependent upon a \nshowing that an agency has (1) ‘improperly’; (2) ‘withheld’; (3) ‘agency records.’”).  While \nnarrowly construed, FOIA’s statutory exemptions “are intended to have meaningful reach and \napplication.” John Doe Agency, 493 U.S. at 152; accord DiBacco v.U.S. Army, 795 F.3d 178, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  \nThe courts resolve most FOIA actions on summary judgment.  See Judicial Watch, Inc. v. \nDep't of the Navy, 25 F. Supp. 3d 131, 136 (D.D.C. 2014).  The Government bears the burden of \nproving that the withheld information falls within the exemptions it invokes.  See 5 U.S.C. § \n552(a)(4)(B); King v. Dep’t of Justice, 830 F.2d 210, 217 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  A court may grant \nsummary judgment to the Government based entirely on an agency’s declarations, provided they \narticulate “the justifications for nondisclosure with reasonably specific detail, demonstrate that \nthe information withheld logically falls within the claimed exemption, and are not controverted \nby either contrary evidence in the record nor by evidence of agency bad faith.” Military Audit \nProject v. Casey, 656 F.2d 724, 738 (D.C. Cir. 1981); accord Gov’t Accountability Project v. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01050-ABJ   Document 8   Filed 08/30/18   Page 16 of 27\nFood & Drug Admin., 206 F. Supp. 3d 420, 430 (D.D.C. 2016).  Such declarations are accorded \n“a presumption of good faith, which cannot be rebutted by purely speculative claims[.]” \nSafeCard Servs., Inc. v. SEC, 926 F.2d 1197, 1200 (D.C. Cir. 1991).  \nB.  Special Considerations in National Security Cases \n \nThe issues presented in this case directly “implicat[e] national security, a uniquely \nexecutive purview.” Ctr. for Nat’l Sec. Studies, 331 F.3d at 926–27.  While courts review de \nnovo an agency’s withholding of information pursuant to a FOIA request, “de novo review in \nFOIA cases is not everywhere alike . . . .”  Ass’n of Retired R.R. Workers, Inc. v. U.S. R.R. Ret. \nBd., 830 F.2d 331, 336 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  Indeed, the courts have specifically recognized the \n“propriety of deference to the executive in the context of FOIA claims which implicate national \nsecurity.”  Ctr. for Nat’l Sec. Studies, 331 F.3d at 927; see Ray v. Turner, 587 F.2d 1187, 1194 \n(D.C. Cir. 1978) (“[T]he executive ha[s] unique insights into what adverse [e]ffects might occur \nas a result of public disclosure of a particular classified record.”). “[A]ccordingly, the \ngovernment’s ‘arguments needs only be both “plausible” and “logical” to justify the invocation \nof a FOIA exemption in the national security context.’” Unrow Human Rights Litig. Clinic v. \nDep’t of State, 134 F. Supp. 3d 263, 272 (D.D.C. 2015) (quoting ACLU v. Dep’t of Def., 628 \nF.3d 612, 624 (D.C. Cir. 2011)).  \nFor these reasons, the courts have “consistently deferred to executive affidavits predicting \nharm to the national security, and have found it unwise to undertake searching judicial review.”  \nCtr. for Nat’l Sec. Studies, 331 F.3d at 927; see Larson v. Dep’t of State, 565 F.3d 857, 865 \n(D.C. Cir. 2009) (citation omitted) (“Today we reaffirm our deferential posture in FOIA cases \nregarding the ‘uniquely executive purview’ of national security.”); accord Unrow Human Rights \nImpact Litig. Clinic, 134 F. Supp. 3d at 272.  Consequently, a reviewing court must afford \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01050-ABJ   Document 8   Filed 08/30/18   Page 17 of 27\n“substantial weight” to agency declarations “in the national security context.” King, 830 F.2d at \n217; see Fitzgibbon v. CIA, 911 F.2d 755, 766 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (holding that the district court \nerred in “perform[ing] its own calculus as to whether or not harm to the national security or to \nintelligence sources and methods would result from disclosure . . . .”); Frugone v. CIA, 169 F.3d \n772, 775 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (because “courts have little expertise in either international diplomacy \nor counterintelligence operations, we are in no position to dismiss the CIA’s facially reasonable \nconcerns” about the harm that disclosure could cause to national security).  FOIA “bars the \ncourts from prying loose from the government even the smallest bit of information that is \nproperly classified or would disclose intelligence sources or methods.” Afshar v. Dep’t of State, \n702 F.2d 1125, 1130 (D.C. Cir. 1983). \nC.  The Glomar Response. \n \nA Glomar response allows the Government to “refuse to confirm or deny the existence of \nrecords where to answer the FOIA inquiry would cause harm cognizable under an FOIA \nexception.”  Wolf v. CIA, 473 F.3d 370, 374 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (quoting Gardels v. CIA, 689 F.2d \n1100, 1103 (D.C. Cir. 1982)); accord Wilner v. NSA, 592 F.3d 60, 68 (2d Cir. 2009) (“The \nGlomar doctrine is well settled as a proper response to a FOIA request because it is the only way \nin which an agency may assert that a particular FOIA statutory exemption covers the ‘existence \nor non-existence of the requested records[.]’” (quoting Phillippi v. CIA, 546 F.2d 1009, 1012 \n(D.C. Cir. 1976)).  In support of a Glomar response, the asserting agency “must explain why it \ncan neither confirm nor deny the existence of responsive records.”  James Madison Project v. \nDep’t of Justice, 208 F. Supp. 3d 265, 283 (D.D.C. 2016) (quoting Parker v. EOUSA, 852 F. \nSupp. 2d 1, 10 (D.D.C. 2012)).  The agency can satisfy this obligation by providing “public \naffidavit[s] explaining in as much detail as is possible the basis for its claim that it can be \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01050-ABJ   Document 8   Filed 08/30/18   Page 18 of 27\nrequired neither to confirm nor to deny the existence of the requested records.”  Phillippi, 546 \nF.2d at 1013. \nThe courts in this Circuit have consistently upheld Glomar responses where, as here, \nconfirming or denying the existence of records would reveal classified information protected by \nFOIA Exemption 1.  See, e.g., Frugone, 169 F.3d at 774–75 (finding that CIA properly refused \nto confirm or deny the existence of records concerning the plaintiff’s alleged employment \nrelationship with CIA pursuant to Exemptions 1 and 3); Larson, 565 F.3d at 861–62 (upholding \nthe National Security Agency’s use of the Glomar response to the plaintiffs’ FOIA requests \nregarding past violence in Guatemala pursuant to Exemptions 1 and 3); Wheeler v. CIA, 271 F. \nSupp. 2d 132, 140 (D.D.C. 2003) (ruling that CIA properly invoked a Glomar response to a \nrequest for records concerning the plaintiff’s activities as a journalist in Cuba during the 1960s \npursuant to Exemption 1). \nII.  NSD Conducted a Reasonable Search and Properly Made a Partial No-Records \nResponse With Respect to FISC Transcripts Related to Carter Page. \n \nAn agency is entitled to summary judgment in a FOIA case with respect to the adequacy \nof its search if it shows “‘that it made a good faith effort to conduct a search for the requested \nrecords, using methods which can be reasonably expected to produce the information \nrequested.’” Clemente v. FBI, 867 F.3d 111, 117 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (quoting Oglesby v. Dep’t of \nthe Army, 920 F.2d 57, 68 (D.C. Cir. 1990)); DiBacco, 795 F.3d at 188.  “[T]he issue to be \nresolved is not whether there might exist any other documents possibly responsive to the request, \nbut rather whether the search for those documents was adequate.”  Weisberg v. DOJ, 745 F.2d \n1476, 1485 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (emphasis in original).  The search is thus gauged “not by the fruits \nof the search, but by the appropriateness of the methods used to carry out the search.” Ancient \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01050-ABJ   Document 8   Filed 08/30/18   Page 19 of 27\nCoin Collectors Guild v. Dep’t of State, 641 F.3d 504, 514 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (quoting Iturralde v. \nComptroller of Currency, 315 F.3d 311, 315 (D.C. Cir. 2003)).   \nIn short, “[a] search need not be perfect, only adequate, and adequacy is measured by the \nreasonableness of the effort in light of the specific request.” DiBacco, 795 F.3d at 194-95 \n(quoting Meeropol v. Meese, 790 F.2d 942, 956 (D.C. Cir. 1986)).  An agency can establish the \nreasonableness of its search by “reasonably detailed, nonconclusory affidavits describing its \nefforts.” Baker & Hostetler LLP v. Dep’t of Commerce, 473 F.3d 312, 318 (D.C. Cir. 2006). \nSuch affidavits are sufficient if they “set[] forth the search terms and the type of search \nperformed, and aver[] that all files likely to contain responsive materials (if such records exist) \nwere searched.” Chambers v. Dep’t of Interior, 568 F.3d 998, 1003 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (quoting \nMcCready v. Nicholson, 465 F.3d 1, 14 (D.C. Cir. 2006)).  This standard is not demanding. “[I]n \nthe absence of countervailing evidence or apparent inconsistency of proof, affidavits that explain \nin reasonable detail the scope and method of the search conducted by the agency will suffice . . . \n. “ Perry v. Block, 684 F.2d 121, 127 (D.C. Cir. 1982). “Agency affidavits are accorded a \npresumption of good faith, which cannot be rebutted by ‘purely speculative claims about the \nexistence and discoverability of other documents.’” SafeCard Servs., Inc., 926 F.2d at 1200 \n(citation omitted); see also Wilbur v. CIA, 355 F.3d 675, 678 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (“[M]ere \nspeculation that as yet uncovered documents might exist[] does not undermine the determination \nthat the agency conducted an adequate search for the requested records.”). \n  The Findlay Declaration demonstrates that NSD has conducted a reasonable search for \nrecords responsive to Plaintiff’s FOIA request insofar as it relates to the acknowledged Carter \nPage FISA applications. As the declaration explained, the Office of Intelligence within NSD is \nthe office in DOJ responsible for representing the Government before the FISC.  Findlay Decl. ¶ \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01050-ABJ   Document 8   Filed 08/30/18   Page 20 of 27\n13.  Accordingly, NSD FOIA consulted with the Office of Intelligence, whose subject matter \nexperts are familiar with these types of records generally and specifically familiar with the \nproceedings related to Carter Page.  Id.  ¶¶ 13-14.  Those supervisors reviewed their records and \nconfirmed that, as is typical in proceedings before the FISC, no hearings were held with respect \nto the acknowledged Carter Page FISA applications, and thus no responsive transcripts exist.   Id.  \n¶14.3  The Findlay Declaration thus confirms that NSD searched the only location reasonably \nlikely to contain responsive records and confirmed that none exist.  Id.  ¶15.  This strategy – \nidentifying the personnel responsible for the requested FISC information, and asking them to \nsearch their records – is a “method[] which can be reasonably expected to produce the \ninformation requested.” Oglesby, 920 F.2d at 68.  Therefore, DOJ is entitled to summary \njudgment on this issue. \nIII.  NSD Properly Refused to Confirm or Deny the Existence of Other Responsive \nRecords Related to Michael Flynn Pursuant to Exemption One. \n \nFOIA Exemption 1 exempts from disclosure information that is “specifically authorized \nunder criteria established by an Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest of national \ndefense or foreign policy” and “are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive Order.” \n5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(1). Under Executive Order No. 13,526, an agency may withhold information \nthat an official with original classification authority has determined to be classified because its \n“unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause identifiable or describable \ndamage to the national security[.]” Exec. Order No. 13,526 § 1.4, 75 Fed. Reg. 707, 709 (Dec. \n29, 2009). The information must also “pertain[] to” one of the categories of information specified \nin the Executive Order, including “intelligence activities (including covert action), intelligence \n                                                           \n3 The FISC Rules of Procedure, as well as an explanatory letter to Congress, are available on the \nFISC website.  See http://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/about-foreign-intelligence-surveillance-court; \nFindlay Decl. ¶ 14. \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01050-ABJ   Document 8   Filed 08/30/18   Page 21 of 27\nsources or methods.” Exec. Order No. 13,526 §§ 1.4(c); see also Judicial Watch, Inc. v. DOD, \n715 F.3d 937, 941 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (citation omitted) (“‘[P]ertains’ is ‘not a very demanding \nverb.’”).  As discussed above, a court “accord[s] substantial weight to an agency’s affidavit \nconcerning the details of the classified status of the disputed records because the Executive \ndepartments responsible for national defense and foreign policy matters have unique insights into \nwhat adverse [e]ffects might occur as a result of a particular classified record.” Larson, 565 F.3d \nat 864 (citation omitted). \nDefendant invoked the Glomar response in order to safeguard currently and properly \nclassified information involving categories of information set forth in Section 1.4 of Executive \nOrder 13,526.  See Findlay Decl. at ¶¶ 16-33.  First, the existence or non-existence of responsive \nrecords implicates “intelligence activities (including covert action), intelligence sources or \nmethods, or cryptology.” Exec. Order 13,526 §1.4(c).  The supporting declaration establishes \nthat disclosing whether or not the defendant agencies possessed responsive records related to \nMichael Flynn would disclose intelligence activities, sources, and methods, including the \nexistence or non-existence of a particular type of intelligence operations regarding a particular \ntarget.  Findlay Decl. ¶¶ 28-29.  Surveillance authorized by the FISC under any of its authorities \nis itself an intelligence method, and thus its use in any particular matter thus “pertains to” an \nintelligence source or method.  Cf. Clapper v. Amnesty Int'l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 401-07 (2013) \n(describing FISA authorities). \nThe Findlay Declaration further demonstrates that confirming whether or not Defendants \npossessed responsive records reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the national \nsecurity of the United States by disclosing the existence or non-existence of intelligence sources \nand methods.  See Findlay Decl.  ¶¶ 28-32.   As explained in the Findlay Declaration, if FISC \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01050-ABJ   Document 8   Filed 08/30/18   Page 22 of 27\ntranscripts related to Michael Flynn did exist, disclosure of that information would suggest that \nhe may have been the target of a particular type of intelligence operation, or at a minimum, that \nthe U.S. Government believed it had sufficient information to target him based on then-existing \nintelligence that met the standards for a FISA warrant.  Id. ¶ 28.  If FISC transcripts related to \nMichael Flynn did not exist, disclosure of that information could suggest that the U.S. \nGovernment lacked sufficient information or interest to target him using that particular method.  \nId. \nFindlay further explains that acknowledging the existence or non-existence of records \nresponsive to this portion of Plaintiff’s request “would be tantamount to confirming whether or \nnot the Department was pursuing particular intelligence operations against a particular target” \nand reveal “otherwise non-public information regarding the nature and scope of the \nDepartment’s supervision of intelligence interests, priorities, activities, and methods—\ninformation that is desired by hostile actors who seek to thwart the Department’s supervision of \nintelligence-gathering missions.”  Findlay Decl. ¶ 31.  This is valuable information to adversaries \nseeking to thwart U.S. intelligence collection. “Once an intelligence activity – or the fact of its \nuse or non-use in a certain situation – is discovered, its continued successful use is seriously \njeopardized.”  Id. ¶ 29.  Moreover, U.S. adversaries review publicly available information to \ndeduce intelligence methods, catalogue information, and take countermeasures; accordingly the \nU.S. Government must take to prevent even indirect references to sensitive sources and methods \nto preserve their utility and effectiveness.  See id.  ¶¶ 30-31.   \nNSD reasonably concluded that to confirm or deny the existence of responsive records \n(to the portion of plaintiff’s FOIA request seeking transcripts of hearings before the FISC \npertaining to Michael Flynn) “could risk compromising intelligence activities, methods, or \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01050-ABJ   Document 8   Filed 08/30/18   Page 23 of 27\nsources, and thus would pose at least a serious risk to the national security.”  Findlay Decl. ¶ 32.  \nAs discussed supra, this declaration is entitled to substantial weight.   \nThe Government routinely makes Glomar responses to similar requests for information \nabout particular surveillance subjects, and courts routinely uphold such responses.  See, e.g., \nMarrera v. DOJ, 622 F. Supp. 51, 53–54 (D.D.C. 1985) (“[T]his Court finds that OIPR’s refusal \nto confirm or deny the existence of FISA records pertaining to this particular plaintiff to be \njustified in the interests of national security as part of an overall policy of [the Executive Order] \nwith respect to all FISA FOIA requests.”); Schwarz v. Dep’t of Treasury, 131 F. Supp. 2d 142, \n149 (D.D.C. 2000) (“The Office properly refused to confirm or deny that it had any responsive \nrecords maintained under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA) and in non-\nFISA files relating to various intelligence techniques.”), aff’d, No. 00-5453, 2001 WL 674636 \n(D.C. Cir. May 10, 2001); Competitive Enter. Inst. v. NSA, 78 F. Supp. 3d 45, 60 (D.D.C. 2015) \n(upholding NSA Glomar response to request for metadata records with respect to two particular \nindividuals); Agility Pub. Warehousing Co. K.S.C. v. NSA, 113 F. Supp. 3d 313, 329 (D.D.C. \n2015) (upholding NSA Glomar in response to request for particular surveillance records); see \nalso Carter v. NSA, No. 1:12-CV-00968-CKK, 2014 WL 2178708, at *1 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 23, \n2014) (upholding Glomar response to request for records related to alleged NSA surveillance of \nplaintiff); Moore v. Obama, No. 09-5072, 2009 WL 2762827, at *1 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 24, 2009) \n(same); Wilner, 592 F.3d at 65 (“Glomar responses are available, when appropriate, to agencies \nwhen responding to FOIA requests for information obtained under a ‘publicly acknowledged’ \nintelligence program, such as the [Terrorist Surveillance Program], at least when the existence of \nsuch information has not already been publicly disclosed.”).   \nAccordingly, the partial Glomar response was proper pursuant to Exemption One. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01050-ABJ   Document 8   Filed 08/30/18   Page 24 of 27\nIV.  The Government Has Not Waived Exemption One By Official Acknowledgment. \n \nAs a general matter, under FOIA, “when an agency has officially acknowledged \notherwise exempt information through prior disclosure, the agency has waived its right to claim \nan exemption with respect to that information.”  ACLU v. CIA, 710 F.3d 422, 426 (D.C. Cir. \n2013).  This “official acknowledgement” principle applies to the Glomar context, so a requester \n“can overcome a Glomar response by showing that the agency has already disclosed the fact of \nthe existence (or non-existence) of responsive records, since that is the purportedly exempt \ninformation that a Glomar response is designed to protect.”  Id. at 427.  But the plaintiff “must \nbear the initial burden of pointing to specific information in the public domain that appears to \nduplicate that being withheld.”  Id. (quoting Wolf, 473 F.3d at 378).   \nThe D.C. Circuit has narrowly construed the “official acknowledgment” doctrine, \nhowever, and to bring such a challenge plaintiff must satisfy three stringent criteria, none of \nwhich are satisfied here.  “First, the information requested must be as specific as the information \npreviously released.”  Wolf, 473 F.3d at 378 (quoting Fitzgibbon, 911 F.2d at 765).  “Prior \ndisclosure of similar information does not suffice; instead, the specific information sought by the \nplaintiff must already be in the public domain by official disclosure.  This insistence on \nexactitude [by the D.C. Circuit] recognizes ‘the Government’s vital interest in information \nrelating to national security and foreign affairs.”  Id. (quoting Pub. Citizen v. Dep’t of State, 11 \nF.3d 198, 203 (D.C. Cir. 1993)); Competitive Enter. Inst., 78 F. Supp. 3d at 54 (“Plaintiffs in this \ncase must therefore point to specific information in the public domain establishing that the NSA \nhas [the claimed information.]”).  The information already released must also be of the same \nlevel of generality as the information sought—broadly crafted disclosures, even on the same \ngeneral topic, do not waive the Glomar response.  See, e.g., Afshar, 702 F.2d at 1133 (previous \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01050-ABJ   Document 8   Filed 08/30/18   Page 25 of 27\ndisclosure that plaintiff had “‘created a problem’ in U.S.-Iranian relations” was too general to \njustify releasing documents detailing the nature of that problem). \n“Second, the information requested must match the information previously disclosed.”  \nWolf, 473 F.3d at 378 (quoting Fitzgibbon, 911 F.2d at 765).  If there are “substantive \ndifferences” between the two, an official-acknowledgment claim must fail.  ACLU v. DOD, 628 \nF.3d at 621.  That is true even if the previous disclosures are on the same topic.  See, e.g., \nCompetitive Enter. Inst., 78 F. Supp. 3d at 57 (a Presidential statement that “the intelligence \ncommunity . . . is looking at phone numbers and durations of calls,” was not adequately \ncongruent with a request seeking the companies that had provided that data to U.S. intelligence \nagencies); Wolf, 473 F.3d at 379 (holding that CIA could not claim Glomar protection when it \nhad previously read excerpts from materials sought into the record during congressional \nhearing). \n“Third, . . . the information requested must already have been made public through an \nofficial and documented disclosure.”  Id. at 378 (quoting Fitzgibbon, 911 F.2d at 765).  Key to \nthis element is that the source must be official; non-governmental releases, or anonymous leaks \nby government officials or former government officials do not qualify.  See, e.g., ACLU v. DOD, \n628 F.3d at 621-22; Agility Public Warehousing Co.  K.S.C., 113 F. Supp. 3d at 330 n.8; \nCompetitive Enter. Inst., 78 F. Supp. 3d at 55.  In other words, “mere public speculation, no \nmatter how widespread,” cannot undermine the agency’s Glomar prerogative.  Wolf, 473 F.3d at \n378.  And Congressional statements also cannot waive Executive Branch classification or other \nExemptions.  See Military Audit Project, 656 F.2d at 742-745; see also Moore v. CIA, 666 F.3d \n1330, 1333 n.4 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (“[W]e do not deem ‘official’ a disclosure made by someone \nother than the agency from which the information is being sought.”). \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01050-ABJ   Document 8   Filed 08/30/18   Page 26 of 27\nPlaintiff cannot meet its burden of pointing to an official disclosure of the information \nthey seek.  The Findlay Declaration establishes that no authorized government official has \ndisclosed the precise information withheld.  See Findlay Decl. ¶¶ 9, 11, 19.  Neither the \nComplaint nor the request point to any statements that could constitute official acknowledgment, \nand nothing in Michael Flynn’s guilty plea and associated documents confirms or denies the \nexistence of FISA applications.  Accordingly, Plaintiff cannot establish official acknowledgment. \nCONCLUSION \n \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant the Government’s motion for summary \njudgment. \n \nDated:  August 30, 2018        Respectfully Submitted, \n \nCHAD A.

Devin Nunes, Chairman of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, \nrequested that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court provide particular hearing transcripts \nto the Committee. \n  6.  Judge Rosemary M. Collyer, the Presiding Judge, responded that the Court would \nreview the request and wrote, “[Y]ou may note that the Department of Justice possesses (or can \neasily obtain) the same responsive information the Court might possess.”   \n  7.  On February 16, 2018, by certified mail, Plaintiff submitted a FOIA request to \nDefendant seeking the same records.  Specifically, Plaintiff requested copies of all transcripts of \nhearings before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court regarding applications for or \nrenewals of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants relating to Carter Page and/or \nMichael Flynn. \n  8.  According to U.S. Postal Service records, Defendant received Plaintiff’s FOIA \nrequest on February 26, 2018. \n  9.  As of the date of this Complaint, Defendant has failed to: (i) produce the \nrequested records or demonstrate that the requested records are lawfully exempt from \nproduction; (ii) notify Plaintiff of the scope of any responsive records Defendant intends to \n- 2 - \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01050-ABJ   Document 1   Filed 05/03/18   Page 3 of 4\nproduce or withhold and the reasons for any withholdings; or (iii) inform Plaintiff that it may \nappeal any adequately specific, adverse determinations. \nCOUNT I \n(Violation of FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552) \n \n  10.  Plaintiff realleges paragraphs 1 through 9 as if fully stated herein. \n  11.  Plaintiff is being irreparably harmed by Defendant’s violation of FOIA, and \nPlaintiff will continue to be irreparably harmed unless Defendant is compelled to comply with \nFOIA. \n12.  To trigger FOIA’s administrative exhaustion requirement, Defendant was \nrequired to determine whether to comply with Plaintiff’s FOIA request within the time limit set \nby FOIA.  Accordingly, Defendant’s determination with respect to Plaintiff’s FOIA request was \ndue by April 9, 2018.  At a minimum, Defendant was obligated to: (i) gather and review the \nrequested documents; (ii) determine and communicate to Plaintiff the scope of any responsive \nrecords Defendant intended to produce or withhold and the reasons for any withholdings; and \n(iii) inform Plaintiff that it may appeal any adequately specific, adverse determination.  See, e.g., \nCitizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. Federal Election Commission, 711 F.3d \n180, 188-89 (D.C. Cir. 2013).     \n13.   Because Defendant failed to determine whether to comply with Plaintiff’s FOIA \nrequests, Plaintiff is deemed to have exhausted its administrative appeal remedies.  5 U.S.C. § \n552(a)(6)(C)(i).     \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court: (1) order Defendant to \nconduct searches for any and all records responsive to Plaintiff’s FOIA request and demonstrate \nthat it employed search methods reasonably likely to lead to the discovery of records responsive \nto Plaintiff’s FOIA request; (2) order Defendant to produce, by a date certain, any and all non-\n- 3 - \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01050-ABJ   Document 1   Filed 05/03/18   Page 4 of 4\nexempt records responsive to Plaintiff’s FOIA request and a Vaughn index of any responsive \nrecords withheld under claim of exemption; (3) enjoin Defendant from continuing to withhold \nany and all non-exempt records responsive to Plaintiff’s FOIA request; (4) grant Plaintiff an \naward of attorneys’ fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred in this action pursuant to 5 \nU.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(E); and (5) grant Plaintiff such other relief as the Court deems just and \nproper. \nDated:  May 3, 2018          Respectfully submitted, \n              /s/ Michael Bekesha       \n              Michael Bekesha \n              D.C.
