The Court requested supplemental briefing regarding whether the Court should vacate defendant's conviction for receipt of child pornography (Count 1) or defendant's conviction for possession of child pornography (Count 2). The Court finds that defendant's transgressions warrant a lesser penalty. The Court, therefore, VACATES defendant's conviction for receipt of child pornography. The Court sets a Sentencing hearing in this matter for 8/29/2016 01:00 PM before Judge Christina A. Snyder. (gk)"

On 11/22/2016, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit remanded this matter and ordered the Court to state the reasons for its order denying Gartenlaub's motion for bail pending appeal [237]. During the sentencing hearing, counsel for defendant requested that Gartenlaub not be required to surrender, but instead be granted bail pending his appeal [215]. The Court denied bond. 18 U.S.C. 3143(b)(1)(A) requires that defendant show, by clear and convincing evidence, that he is not likely to flee. See Wheeler, 795 F.2d at 840. The Court finds that defendant has failed to make such a showing. Accordingly, defendants application for bail pending appeal is DENIED. (gk)"

    "summary": "<p>The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) requires the government to obtain a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) before it may conduct any domestic electronic surveillance to acquire foreign intelligence information. The warrant applications are made ex parte and must include a sworn statement by a federal officer of the facts and circumstances relied upon to justify the government's belief that the target of surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power. Once a FISC judge receives a warrant application, the judge can order approval of the surveillance only if the judge finds that there is probable cause to believe that the target of the electronic surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power. Because the orders only authorize surveillance up to 90 days, the government must file an application for an extension that meets the same requirements as the initial warrant application and obtain a renewal order from the FISC for continued surveillance. For the Civil Rights Litigation Clearinghouse collection of FISA matters, see our <a href=\"../../../../search/case/?special_collection=5659&amp;ordering=-summary_approved_date\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">special collection</a>.</p>\r\n<p>In 2013, Wesley Harris, an FBI agent in Los Angeles, California, read a Wired.com article (https://www.wired.com/2013/01/china-transport-first-flight/) reporting that the Chinese had developed a military transport plane, with similarities to the United States's C-17 aircraft, which had been developed by Boeing. The article mused that \"Beijing may also have acquired some of the C-17's blueprints from a spy working at Boeing.\" Subsequently, Agent Harris launched an investigation, which soon focused on Keith Gartenlaub, who was working at Boeing at the time. In June 2013, a magistrate judge in Los Angeles issued a warrant authorizing a search of Gartenlaub's email account (2013 email search). The FBI subsequently submitted an application for a FISA warrant to the FISC. The FISC authorized a search of Gartenlaub's home and computer, which were executed by FBI agents on January 29 and 30, 2014. During that search, FBI agents found hard drives containing child pornography. In August 2014, the FBI obtained additional search warrants from a magistrate judge, authorizing searches of Gartenlaub's home, storage units, and computers for evidence of child pornography. In the subsequent search, the FBI seized three hard drives containing child pornography.</p>\r\n<p>On August 27, 2014, Gartenlaub was charged in a criminal complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California following his arrest. Gartenlaub was arrested that day on a federal charge of knowingly possessing child pornography. In addition to filing the criminal complaint, the government filed a notice of intent to use information obtained from electronic surveillance and physical searched conducted pursuant to FISA. On February 2, 2015, the defendant filed, under seal, a motion seeking disclosure of the FISA materials, suppression of all information gathered through FISA, and a <em>Franks v. Delaware</em> hearing in order to establish that the FISA application and resulting search warrant application contained intentional or reckless material falsehoods and omissions. On May 4, 2015, the government filed a largely classified, ex parte opposition to Gartenlaub's FISA motion, arguing that the court should conduct an <em>in camera</em>, ex parte review of the FISA materials due to the classified and highly sensitive nature of the FISA materials. On August 6, 2016, District Judge Christina A. Snyder, in a sealed opinion, refused to disclose to Gartenlaub the FISA application and order, and she denied his motion to suppress the fruits of the FISA search.</p>\r\n<p>On December 10, 2015, Gartenlaub was convicted by a jury for receipt and possession of child pornography; Judge Snyder dismissed the receipt count as multiplicitous. On August 29, 2016, Gartenlaub was sentenced to 41 months of imprisonment and $3,430 in restitution.</p>\r\n<p>On September 9, 2016, Gartenlaub appealed his conviction and his sentence to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals (docket number 16-50339). On February 15, 2017, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union filed an amicus brief in support of Gartenlaub and reversal. On December 4, 2017, the parties conducted oral arguments in front of Circuit Judges Kim McLane Wardlaw and Ronald M. Gould, and District Judge for the District of South Dakota Lawrence L. Piersol (sitting by designation).</p>\r\n<p>On February 24, 2018, John D. Cline, attorney for Gartenlaub, wrote a letter to the appeals court's clerk. On February 2, 2018, President Trump had declassified and approved the release of a House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) majority memorandum that summarizes portions of a FISA application targeting Carter Page, an American citizen and a onetime foreign policy advisor to the Trump Campaign. See <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17114\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">In re Carter W. Page</a>. Cline argued that the declassification of the HPSCI memorandum demonstrated that \"it is possible to discuss publicly the merits of a FISA application without damaging national security;\" therefore, he reasoned that if the HPSCI memorandum could be disclosed without harming national security, then a comparable disclosure of the FISA application for Gartenlaub should also be disclosed.</p>\r\n<p>On October 2, 2018, in an unpublished and unsigned memorandum, the appeals court affirmed Gartenlaub's conviction. First, the appeals court found that a rational jury could have found the essential elements, including knowledge, of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. In particular, the government had demonstrated that Gartenlaub knew that child pornography was present on his computer and that he had accessed the child pornography through his password-protected computer user account. The appeals court also found that the district court did not commit plain error by failing to suppress the evidence from Gartenlaub's computer, since \"[n]o controlling authority dictates the conclusion that the government's [FISA] search and subsequent use of FISA-derived materials in a non-national security prosecution violates the Fourth Amendment.\" But the appeals court did note that this case came \"perilously close to the exact abuses against which the Fourth Amendment was designed to protect.\" Furthermore, despite a circuit split as to what deference appeals courts should give a district court's determination that a FISA order was based on probable cause, the appeals court declined to resolve the issue. It believed that probable cause existed here, under either a de novo or an abuse of discretion standard of review, to support the FISA warrant. Lastly, after having conducted an <em>in camera</em> review of the underlying FISA materials, the appeals court concluded that the disclosure of the FISA materials to Gartenlaub was not \"necessary to make an accurate determination of the legality of the search.\" 751 Fed.Appx. 998.</p>\r\n<p>On March 7, 2019, Gartenlaub appealed his conviction to the United States Supreme Court. His petition for certiorari was denied on April 22, 2019.</p>\r\n<p>In December 2019, the U.S. Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General issued a report examining Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) applications. Following that report, in March 2020, the Inspector General issued a memorandum that included discussion of systemic errors in FBI FISA applications.</p>\r\n<p>This information was previously unavailable to Gartenlaub. In response to the memo and report, on April 22, 2020, he petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 USC &sect; 2241, in the United States District Court for the Central District of California.</p>\r\n<p>The petition argued that the March 2020 Inspector General Memorandum revealed \"systemic, pervasive and serious errors and omissions&rdquo; in FBI FISA applications around the same time the FISA application in this case was submitted in January 2014. The memo discussed applications from October 2014 through September 2019. All 29 FBI FISA applications the Inspector General reviewed contained errors, omissions, and/or procedural failures. Gartenlaub argued that, in light of the fact he was unable to review his FISA application and that his requests for a <em>Franks </em>hearing was denied, this new previously concealed evidence of systemic errors in FBI FISA applications was grounds to vacate his conviction, grant a new trial, or at least vacate his lifetime probation.</p>\r\n<p>The habeas case was initially assigned to District Judge Otis D. Wright, II, as a 28 USC &sect; 2255 case. The docket number is 2:20-cv-03711. On November 23, 2020, the case was reassigned to Judge Christina A. Snyder because she had presided over Gartenlaub&rsquo;s criminal trial.</p>\r\n<p>While Gartenlaub initially filed a motion for default judgment on November 20, 2020, it was later denied as moot on November 30, 2020.</p>\r\n<p>On August 5, 2022, the court denied Gartenlaub&rsquo;s habeas petition. It held that the relitigation bar foreclosed Gartenlaub&rsquo;s claims because his claims had been fully addressed by the district court and the Ninth Circuit, including an <em>in camera</em> review of the FISA materials, and he did not present any new material evidence to the court. Without new evidence, his petition raised the same issues that had already been addressed by the courts. 2022 WL 3155401.</p>\r\n<p>On August 22, 2022, Gartenlaub appealed the district court&rsquo;s denial to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (case number: 22-55799). He also filed a motion for a certificate of appealability, which the district court denied on August 24, 2022.</p>\r\n<p>As of November 24, 2023, the appeal is pending.</p>",

    "summary_short": "In August 2014, Keith Gartenlaub was charged in a criminal complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California for knowingly possessing child pornography. The defendant argued that the government violated his Fourth Amendment by using evidence obtained from a FISA warrant in a non-national security prosecution. However, District Judge Christina A. Snyder refused to disclose to the defendant the classified FISA application and order, and she denied his motion to suppress the fruits of the FISA search. In December 2015, a jury convicted the defendant for receipt and possession of child pornography, and the defendant was sentenced to 41 months of prison. In September 2016, the defendant appealed his conviction to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which, in an unpublished and unsigned memorandum, upheld his conviction in October 2018. On March 7, 2019, Gartenlaub appealed his conviction to the United States Supreme Court.  His petition for certiorari was denied on April 22, 2019. On April 22, 2020, Gartenlaub filed a motion, under 28 USC § 2255, seeking habeas relief, which was later denied. As of November 2023, his appeal of the denial is pending.",

Doc. 247. \nISSUES PRESENTED \n1.  Is  the  evidence  sufficient  for  a  rational  jury  to  find  beyond  a \nreasonable  doubt  that  appellant  Gartenlaub  knowingly  possessed  child \npornography?  \n2.  Did  the  government's  application  to  the  Foreign  Intelligence \nSurveillance Court establish probable cause to believe that appellant was an \"agent \nof a foreign power,\" as defined at 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801(b) and 1821(1)? \n3.  Did the district court err in refusing to order a Franks hearing? \n4.  Did  the  government  exceed  the  scope  of  the  Foreign  Intelligence \nSurveillance Court order authorizing agents to search appellant's computers for \nforeign  intelligence  information,  and  thus  violate  the  Fourth  Amendment,  by \n                                          \n1 Appellant's Excerpts of Record are cited as \"ER.\"  His sealed Excerpts of \nRecord are cited as \"Sealed ER.\"  District court filings are cited by docket number \nand page.  Transcripts are cited by date and page.  \n     \n\n \nsearching every file on the computers and seizing child pornography that it found \nin the course of the search? \n5.  Did the district court err in refusing to order disclosure to the defense \nof  the  application  the  government  submitted  to  the  Foreign  Intelligence \nSurveillance Court and the order of that court authorizing the search of appellant's \nhome and computers? \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nThis is--in the district court's words--a \"one-of-a-kind\" child pornography \ncase.  T.8/29/16 at 7.  Keith Gartenlaub stands convicted of a single count of \npossession, based on the presence on several computer hard drives of fewer than \n100 files containing child pornography.  The child pornography files had not been \ndownloaded to any of the hard drives; rather, they had been copied to one of the \ndrives in 2005 and then copied (along with thousands of other files as part of an \nenormous folder with multiple subfolders called \"Origdata\") from that drive to the \nnext  and  so  on.    No  one  could  say  who  originally  downloaded  the  child \npornography files or who placed them initially on Gartenlaub's computer.  Three \nfacts are undisputed, however:  there is no evidence that anyone opened any of the \nchild pornography files at any point from when they were first copied to one of \nGartenlaub's hard drives in 2005 until the government seized the drives in 2014; no \nnew files containing child pornography were added to any of the hard drives after \n  2    \n\n \nthe  initial  copying  in  2005;  and  numerous  people  had  access  to  and  used \nGartenlaub's computer during the period when the child pornography files were \nfirst placed on one of his hard drives. \nAs the district court recognized at sentencing, T.8/29/16 at 5-7, the absence \nof evidence that Gartenlaub originally downloaded the child pornography files, that \nhe added to the child pornography files between 2005 and 2014, or that he ever \nopened  those  files  sets  this  case  apart  from  every  previous  child  pornography \nprosecution.   \nApart from the unique facts concerning the never-opened child pornography \nfiles, how the government found those files on Gartenlaub's hard drives in the first \nplace sets this case apart.  The government's searches of those hard drives--first \nsecretly under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and then under a warrant \nthat relied on what the FISA search had found--represent a startling invasion of an \nAmerican  citizen's  privacy.    As  discussed  below,  those  searches  violated \nGartenlaub's  Fourth  Amendment  protection  against  unreasonable  searches  and \nseizures. \nI.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY. \nOn October 23, 2014, the grand jury indicted Gartenlaub for receipt and \npossession of child pornography.  ER296.  Through pretrial motions, he challenged \na  January  2014  FISA  search  of  his  home  and  computers  and  an  August  2014 \n  3    \n\n \nsearch of his computers on Fourth Amendment and other grounds.  He sought \ndisclosure  of  the  underlying  FISA  application  and  order,  and  he  requested  a \nhearing  under  Franks  v.  Delaware,  438  U.S.  154  (1978),  at  which  he  could \nestablish that the FISA application and the August 2014 search warrant application \ncontained intentional or reckless material falsehoods and omissions.  Docs. 67, 70, \n73. \nThe  government  submitted  a  largely  classified,  ex  parte  opposition  to \nGartenlaub's FISA motion.2  The district court reviewed the FISA application and \norder,  together  with  the  classified  portions  of  the  government's  opposition,  in \ncamera and ex parte.  In an 11-page opinion drafted by the government and signed \nwithout change by the district court, the court refused to disclose to the defense the \nFISA application and order and denied Gartenlaub's motion to suppress the fruits \nof the FISA search.  ER21.  Later, however, the court expressed some misgivings; \nit declared, \"I do have some personal questions regarding the propriety of the FISA \ncourt  proceeding  even  though  that  certainly  seems  to  be  legally  authorized.\"  \nT.4/18/16 at 9-10.  The court also denied Gartenlaub's motion to suppress the \nevidence obtained through the August 2014 searches.  ER321. \nThe  jury  found  Gartenlaub  guilty  on  both  counts.    The  district  court \ndismissed the receipt count (Count 1) as multiplicitous.  Doc. 210.  On August 29, \n                                          \n2  The  defense  received  a  heavily  redacted  version  of  the  government's \nopposition.  Doc. 82. \n  4    \n\n \n2016, the court sentenced Gartenlaub to 41 months imprisonment and $3430 in \nrestitution.  ER1.  The district court and this Court denied Gartenlaub's motion for \nbail pending appeal.  He must self-surrender by noon on February 14, 2017.  Doc. \n247. \nII.  RELEVANT FACTS. \nA.  The Investigation of Gartenlaub. \nIn 2013, Wesley Harris, an FBI agent in Los Angeles, read an article from \nWired.com noting that the Chinese had developed a military transport plane \"in \nroughly the same class as the U.S. C-17 or the Russian Il-76.\"  ER378.  The article \nasserted that the Russian Il-76 \"seems to be the basis of the Y-20's design,\" but \nadded that \"'Beijing may also have acquired some of the C-17's blueprints from a \nspy working at Boeing.\"  ER379.3  The agent read a second article, which asserted \nthat \"hackers\" may have compromised the Boeing C-17 and other Boeing aircraft.  \nId. \nBased on these articles, Agent Harris launched an investigation that swiftly \nfocused  on  Gartenlaub,  who  worked  at  Boeing.    There  was  never  a  shred  of \n                                          \n3 A previous version of the Wired.com article, published in December 2012, \nidentified  the  potential  Boeing  spy  as  Dongfan  Chung.  \nhttps://www.wired.com/2012/12/china-debuts-giant-transport/.    Chung  was \nconvicted  in  2010  of  providing  Boeing  trade  secrets  to  China  (although  the \nconviction did not involve the C-17), and this Court affirmed in 2011.  United \nStates v. Chung, 659 F.3d 815 (9th Cir. 2011).  The Harris affidavit does not \nmention Chung. \n  5    \n\n \nevidence that Gartenlaub had provided C-17 information to China.  There was no \nsuch evidence in 2012, and there is none today.  But Agent Harris seized on two \nprincipal facts:  that Gartenlaub's position at Boeing allegedly gave him access to \nC-17 data and that his wife was born in China (although she is a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen), as a result of which he has traveled to China, communicated with his \nwife's relatives in China, and owned property in China jointly with his wife.  Agent \nHarris learned that Gartenlaub disclosed his Chinese travel to Boeing and received \napproval.  He learned that Gartenlaub's communications with China had nothing to \ndo with the C-17 and were easily explained by his family relationship.  He learned \nthat many others had access to the C-17 data.  Nonetheless, Agent Harris used \nGartenlaub's alleged access (which the agent misunderstood and exaggerated), his \nChinese-born wife, and other innocuous facts to construct a fictitious picture of \nGartenlaub as a spy for China. \nIn June 2013, Agent Harris took his theory to a Magistrate Judge in Los \nAngeles and obtained a search warrant for Gartenlaub's and his wife's personal \nemail accounts.  As discussed below, the affidavit in support of the warrant does \nnot come close to establishing probable cause that the emails contain evidence that \nGartenlaub spied for China.  The Harris affidavit is, in any event, rife with material \nfalsehoods and omissions.   \n  6    \n\n \nThe emails, once produced in response to the warrant, provided no support \nfor Agent Harris' theory.  Undeterred, the FBI turned to the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court (\"FISC\").  Based on a secret submission which has never been \ndisclosed to the defense--but which presumably sought to establish probable cause \nto believe that Gartenlaub was an \"agent of a foreign power,\" namely China--the \nFISC authorized a search of Gartenlaub's home and computers.  On January 29 and \n30, 2014, agents conducted the secret search and imaged three hard drives they \nfound in the home.  Over the following months, agents pored through the massive \namount of data they had obtained.  The FBI found no evidence that Gartenlaub had \nprovided C-17 data to China or otherwise acted as a spy for China.  But the agents \ndid find, among the thousands of files on the hard drives, a handful containing \nchild pornography. \nThe agents dropped the theory that Gartenlaub was a spy for China and \nembraced instead the theory that he collected child pornography.  In August 2014, \nthe FBI obtained a search warrant for premises associated with Gartenlaub, seeking \nevidence  that  he  received  and  possessed  child  pornography.    ER243.    The \napplication for the August 2014 warrant relied heavily on the fact that the secret \nFISA search from January 2014 (described in the warrant application as \"a court-\nauthorized search without notice\" to the occupants) had found child pornography \non hard drives associated with Gartenlaub.  ER248-49.  The FBI search led to the \n  7    \n\n \nseizure of three hard drives that the FBI had imaged during the FISA search, plus a \nfourth that contained a copy of the \"Origdata\" folder structure, including the files \nwith child pornography. \nB.  The Evidence at Trial. \nThe evidence at trial showed that in 2005 fewer than 100 files containing \nchild  pornography  were  copied  to  a  hard  drive  found  later  in  Gartenlaub's \npossession and that no new child pornography files were added after that date.  \nER194-95, 199-200.4  There was no evidence showing who initially downloaded \nthe child pornography files, or to what hard drive.  ER193-95, 217.  The child \npornography files were copied--along with tens of thousands of other files in an \nenormous folder structure called \"Origdata\"--to three other hard drives found in \nGartenlaub's possession.  There was no evidence that Gartenlaub or anyone else \nopened the files containing child pornography at any point from 2005 when they \nwere first copied to one of the hard drives until the hard drives were seized in \n2014.    See  generally  ER193-230  (cross-examination  of  government  computer \nforensic expert Bruce Pixley).  The evidence also showed that a number of other \npeople  had  access  to  Gartenlaub's  computer  during  the  period  when  the  child \n                                          \n4 There was some question about the number of child pornography files \nfound on Gartenlaub's hard drives.  A review by the National Center for Missing \nand Exploited Children identified 22 such files.  The additional 70 or so alleged \nchild pornography files apparently were identified by non-expert agents.  E.g., \nT.12/4/15 at 72, 92-94. \n  8    \n\n \npornography files were first copied to his hard drive.  T.12/9/15 at 403-05, 412-16, \n421-23. \nWe discuss the trial evidence in more detail in Part I of the argument.  \nIII.  RULINGS PRESENTED FOR REVIEW. \nGartenlaub seeks review of (1) the district court's order denying his motion \nfor  judgment  of  acquittal,  ER8;  (2)  the  district  court's  order  finding  that  the \ngovernment's application to the FISC established probable cause to believe that \nGartenlaub was an agent of a foreign power, ER23-24, 28; (3) the district court's \nrefusal to order a Franks hearing, ER25, 29-30; and (4) the district court's order \ndenying Gartenlaub's motion for disclosure of the government's application to the \nFISC and the FISC order authorizing the search of his home and computers, ER25-\n28.  Gartenlaub's trial counsel did not raise the issue concerning the scope of the \ngovernment's search and seizure under the FISC order; that issue is reviewed for \nplain error.   \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n1.  On  Count  2--the  sole  count  of  conviction--the  government  was \nrequired  to  prove  that  on  or  about  August  27,  2014,  Gartenlaub  \"knowingly \npossessed a computer disk or any other material that defendant knew contained a \nvisual depiction . . . of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct.\"  T.12/9/15 at \n450.  As we demonstrate below, no rational juror could find beyond a reasonable \n  9    \n\n \ndoubt that Gartenlaub knowingly possessed the child pornography found on his \nhard drives. \n2.  The government's secret search of Gartenlaub's computers in January \n2014  violated  his  Fourth  Amendment  rights  in  several  respects.    First,  the \ngovernment's application to the FISC--to the extent was complete and accurate--\ndid not establish probable cause to believe that he is an \"agent of a foreign power\" \n(China).    Second,  the  application  to  the  FISC  likely  contained  intentional  or \nreckless  material  falsehoods  or  omissions,  requiring  a  Franks  hearing.    Third, \nunder FISA the FISC order could only authorize a search for \"foreign intelligence \ninformation.\"  By seizing and then examining files containing child pornography--\nwhich plainly is not \"foreign intelligence information\"--the government exceeded \nthe scope of the FISC order.  Because the August 2014 search warrant affidavit \nrelied heavily on the child pornography evidence obtained through the unlawful \nJanuary  2014  search,  the  fruits  of  that  search--including  all  of  the  child \npornography files at issue--must be suppressed. \n3.  The  district  court  erred  in  denying  the  defense  access  to  the \ngovernment's  application  to  the  FISC  and  to  the  FISC  order  authorizing  the \nJanuary 2014 search of Gartenlaub's home and computers.  Disclosure was both \n\"necessary  to  make  an  accurate  determination  of  the  legality  of  the  physical \nsearch,\" 50 U.S.C. § 1825(g), and required as a matter of due process. \n  1 0   \n\n \nARGUMENT \nI.  THE  EVIDENCE  WAS  INSUFFICIENT  TO  SUSTAIN \n  GARTENLAUB'S CONVICTION.  \nOn Count 2--the sole count of conviction--the government was required to \nprove  that  on  or  about  August  27,  2014,  Gartenlaub  \"knowingly  possessed  a \ncomputer  disk  or  any  other  material  that  defendant  knew  contained  a  visual \ndepiction . . . of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct.\"  T.12/9/15 at 450.  \nAs we demonstrate below, no rational juror could find beyond a reasonable doubt \nthat Gartenlaub knowingly possessed the child pornography on his hard drives. \nA.  Standard of Review. \nThis Court reviews sufficiency of the evidence de novo.  The sufficiency of \nthe  evidence  depends  on  \"whether,  viewing  the  evidence  in  the  light  most \nfavorable  to  the  prosecution,  any  rational  trier  of  fact  could  have  found  the \nessential  elements  of  the  crime  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt.\"    United  States  v. \nWillard,  230  F.3d  1093,  1095  (9th  Cir.  2000).    Circumstantial  evidence  may \nsupport a conviction, but \"mere suspicion or speculation . . . does not rise to the \nlevel of sufficient evidence.\"  United States v. Hernandez-Orellana, 539 F.3d 994, \n1004 (9th Cir. 2008) (quotation omitted); see, e.g., United States v. Andrews, 75 \nF.3d 552, 556 (9th Cir. 1996); United States v. Dinkane, 17 F.3d 1192, 1196 (9th \nCir. 1994). \n  1 1   \n\n \nB.  The Evidence Did Not Establish That Gartenlaub Knowingly  \n    Possessed Child Pornography. \nThree cases from this Court frame the sufficiency issue.  First, in United \nStates v. Romm, 455 F.3d 990 (9th Cir. 2006), the defendant--who had prior child \npornography convictions--admitted viewing child pornography on his laptop; he \nadmitted downloading or saving the child pornography images for five minutes and \nthen deleting them; and 42 of the images were found in the internet cache on his \ncomputer.5  There was no evidence the defendant ever went into the internet cache \nor accessed files there.  See id. at 994-96.   \nThis Court began its analysis by noting that it had previously upheld the \nconviction of a defendant who downloaded child pornography to his computer.  \nSee id. at 999 (citing United States v. Mohrbacher, 182 F.3d 1041, 1048-51 (9th \nCir. 1999)).  On the facts before it, the Court reached the same conclusion where \nthe child pornography files were cached, rather than downloaded.  As the Court \nsummarized the evidence: \nBy his own admission to ICE, Romm repeatedly sought out \nchild  pornography  over  the  internet.  When  he  found  images  he \n\"liked,\" he would \"view them, save them to his computer, look at \nthem for about five minutes [] and then delete them.\"  Either while \n                                          \n5 \"The 'internet cache' or 'internet temporary folder' is a 'set of files kept by a \nweb browser to avoid having to download the same material repeatedly.'\"  Romm, \n455 F.3d at 993 n.1 (quoting Douglas Downing et al., Dictionary of Computer and \nInternet Terms 149 (Barron's 8th ed. 2003)).  Unlike downloading, caching occurs \nautomatically.  See, e.g., United States v. Parish, 308 F.3d 1025, 1030-31 (9th Cir. \n2002). \n  1 2   \n\n \nviewing the images or shortly thereafter, Romm twice masturbated.  \nHe described his activities as the \"saving\" and \"downloading\" of the \nimages.    While  the  images  were  displayed  on  screen  and \nsimultaneously stored to his cache, Romm could print them, email \nthem, or save them as copies elsewhere.  Romm could destroy the \ncopy  of  the  images  that  his  browser  stored  to  his  cache.    And \naccording to detective Luckie, Romm did just that, either manually, or \nby instructing his browser to do so.  Forensic evidence showed that \nRomm had enlarged several thumbnail images for better viewing.  In \nshort, given the indicia that Romm exercised control over the images \nin his cache, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that \nRomm committed the act of knowing possession. \nId. at 1000-01.  The Court found this evidence sufficient to establish knowing \npossession.  Id. at 1001.     \nSecond,  in  United  States  v.  Kuchinski,  469  F.3d  853  (9th  Cir.  2006),  a \nsentencing  appeal,  the  Court  (citing  Romm)  reiterated  that  \"a  person  does \nknowingly receive and possess child pornography images when he seeks them out \nover the internet and then downloads them to his computer.\"  Id. at 861 (footnote \nomitted).  The defendant acknowledged that he had downloaded 110 images of \nchild pornography, for which he was responsible at sentencing.  But thousands \nmore images appeared in the cache file on his computer; the issue was whether the \ndefendant knowingly possessed those images as well.  Because the Court found \nthat the defendant \"lack[ed] knowledge about the cache files, and concomitantly \nlack[ed] access to and control over those files,\" it concluded that the images in the \ncache files should not count for sentencing purposes.  Id. at 863. \n  1 3   \n\n \nFinally, in United States v. Flyer, 633 F.3d 911 (9th Cir. 2011), the child \npornography  images  were  found  in  \"unallocated  space\"  on  the  defendant's \ncomputer.  See id. at 918.  \"Unallocated space is space on a hard drive that contains \ndeleted  data,  usually  emptied  from  the  operating  system's  trash  or  recycle  bin \nfolder, that cannot be seen or accessed by the user without the use of forensic \nsoftware.\"    Id.    The  Court  distinguished  Romm:    \"Unlike  Romm,  there  is  no \nevidence here that Flyer had accessed, enlarged, or manipulated any of the charged \nimages, and he made no admission that he had viewed the charged images on or \nnear the time alleged in the indictment.\"  Id. at 919.  The government argued that \nthe deletion of the files (resulting in their placement in unallocated space) sufficed \nto establish that the defendant knowingly possessed them.  The Court rejected the \ngovernment's  position:    \"[D]eletion  of  an  image  alone  does  not  support  a \nconviction for knowing possession of child pornography on or about a certain date \nwithin the meaning of § 2252(a)(4)(B) (2004).  No evidence indicated that on or \nabout April 13, 2004, Flyer could recover or view any of the charged images in \nunallocated space or that he even knew of their presence there.  Accordingly, the \ndistrict  court  committed  plain  error,  and  we  reverse  Flyer's  conviction  on  [the \npossession charge].\"  Id. at 920. \nUnder these decisions, the evidence is insufficient to prove that Gartenlaub \nknowingly  possessed  child  pornography  \"[o]n  or  about  August  27,  2014,\"  as \n  1 4   \n\n \ncharged in the indictment.  ER297.  Unlike Romm (the case in which the Court \nfound the evidence sufficient) and like Flyer (where the Court found the evidence \ninsufficient), \"there is no evidence here that [Gartenlaub] had accessed, enlarged, \nor manipulated any of the charged images, and he made no admission that he had \nviewed the charged images on or near the time alleged in the indictment.\"  Flyer, \n633 F.3d at 919.  In fact, the argument for reversal is even stronger than in Flyer, \nwhere there was evidence--lacking here--that the defendant had deleted the child \npornography images and thus that he had accessed them at some point. \nThe images here were on Gartenlaub's hard drives--not in cache files or \nunallocated space, as in Romm, Kuchinski, and Flyer.  But given the absence of \nevidence that Gartenlaub downloaded them or that he accessed them at any point in \nthe nine years preceding August 27, 2014, the location of the files on his hard \ndrives should not matter.  Nor does the copying of the files supply the missing \nevidence of knowing possession on the date in question.  Each instance of copying \nrepresented the transfer of the thousands of files in the \"Origdata\" structure (and, \nindeed, on the entire drive) from one hard drive to another--exactly the kind of \ngeneral copying that occurs when a person transfers files from an old computer to a \nnew one.  ER200-01.  There was no evidence that any of the files containing child \npornography was copied except as part of a mass migration of files from one \ncomputer to another. \n  1 5   \n\n \nIn  its  order  denying  Gartenlaub's  motion  for  judgment  of  acquittal,  the \ndistrict court noted several facts that, in its view, permitted a rational jury to find \nknowing possession beyond a reasonable doubt.  ER9, 11.  The court observed, for \nexample,  that  some  folders  included  in  the  \"Origdata\"  structure  contained \nGartenlaub's personal documents.  ER11.  But those were different folders than the \nfolders containing child pornography.  The fact that Gartenlaub accessed other \nfolders on the computer (which contained hundreds of folders) has no bearing on \nhis  knowledge  of  the  contents  of  the  folders  containing  child  pornography.  \nMoreover,  the  examples  the  government  offered  of  Gartenlaub's  personal \ndocuments--GX48-54--all predated the initial placement of the child pornography \non his hard drive in 2005 and even the initial download of the files by an unknown \nperson to an unknown hard drive in 2002 or 2003. \nThe court noted that \"several files and folders on defendant's hard drives \ncontaining child pornography were renamed or moved by a person with access to \ndefendant's computer.\"  ER11.  But there was no evidence who did the renaming or \nmoving, and--according to the government's computer expert--it occurred between \nMarch 2005 and March 2006, ER144-49--more than eight years before the date on \nwhich Gartenlaub allegedly knowingly possessed the child pornography.   \nThe  district  court  asserted  that  \"someone  configured  the  settings  on \ndefendant's computer so as not to maintain recently played video footage.\"  ER11.  \n  1 6   \n\n \nBut there was no evidence of that anyone undertook any such \"configuration\"; the \nvideo player on one of the computers simply did not maintain a record of what \nvideos were played.  ER175-76.  Moreover, the court did not explain how this \n\"configuration,\" even if attributed to Gartenlaub, would show knowing possession \nof child pornography. \nFinally, the district court noted that \"someone had accessed a folder on one \nof  defendant's  hard  drives  with  file  names  indicating  child  pornography  was \ncontained therein.\"  ER11; see ER175-79.  But there is no evidence who opened \nthe folder (the account name was \"Keith,\" but the evidence showed that a number \nof people had access to the computer during the relevant period, T.12/9/15 at 403-\n05,  412-16,  421-23),  or  for  how  long  the  folder  was  open,  or  whether  the \nunidentified  person  who  opened  it  read  the  names  of  the  files  it  contained.  \nGovernment expert Pixley confirmed, however, that he found no evidence that the \nuser viewed specific files.  ER175-76. \nNone of the evidence the district court cited permits a rational juror to find \nbeyond  a  reasonable  doubt  that  Gartenlaub  knowingly  possessed  child \npornography in August 2014.  As Kuchinski and Flyer confirm, such a finding \nwould  require  precisely  the  \"speculation\"  that  this  Court  forbids.    Hernandez-\nOrellana, 539 F.3d at 1004 (quotation omitted); see, e.g., Andrews, 75 F.3d at 556; \nDinkane, 17 F.3d at 1196.  The Court should order Gartenlaub acquitted. \n  1 7   \n\n \nII.  THE  GOVERNMENT'S  SEARCH  OF  GARTENLAUB'S \n  COMPUTERS  IN  JANUARY  2014  VIOLATED  HIS  FOURTH \n  AMENDMENT RIGHTS.  \nThe government's secret search of Gartenlaub's computers in January 2014 \nviolated his Fourth Amendment rights in several respects.  First, the government's \napplication to the FISC--to the extent was complete and accurate--did not establish \nprobable cause to believe that he is an \"agent of a foreign power\" (China).  Second, \nthe  application  to  the  FISC  likely  contained  intentional  or  reckless  material \nfalsehoods or omissions, requiring a Franks hearing.  Third, under FISA the FISC \norder could only authorize a search for \"foreign intelligence information.\"  By \nseizing and then examining files containing child pornography--which plainly is \nnot \"foreign intelligence information\"--the government exceeded the scope of the \nFISC order.  Because the August 2014 search warrant affidavit relied heavily on \nthe  child  pornography  evidence  obtained  through  the  unlawful  January  2014 \nsearch, the fruits of that search--including all of the child pornography files at \nissue--must be suppressed.     \nA.  Standard of Review. \nThis  Court  reviews  the  denial  of  a  motion  to  suppress  de  novo,  but \n\"underlying  factual  findings  are  reviewed  for  clear  error.\"    United  States  v. \nMohamud, 843 F.3d 420, 432 (9th Cir. 2016).  The Court reviews a district court's \ndenial of a Franks hearing de novo.  See United States v. Shryock, 342 F.3d 948, \n  1 8   \n\n \n975 (9th Cir. 2003).  Where no objection is made in the district court, this Court \nreviews for plain error.  \"Under plain-error review, reversal is permitted only when \nthere is (1) error that is (2) plain, (3) affects substantial rights, and (4) seriously \naffects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"  Flyer, \n633 F.3d at 917 (quotation omitted). \nAs noted above, the district court adopted verbatim an 11-page proposed \nopinion  on  the  FISA  suppression  and  disclosure  issues  written  by  government \ncounsel.    ER21.    This  Court  has  repeatedly  criticized  the  practice  of  adopting \nverbatim  one  party's  proposed  order,  noting  that  it  \"generally  makes  appellate \nreview more difficult and invites distortion and overstatement by the prevailing \nparty.\"  Stead Motors of Walnut Creek v. Automotive Machinists Lodge 1173, 886 \nF.2d 1200, 1204 n.5 (9th Cir. 1989) (citing cases); see, e.g., Industrial Building \nMaterials, Inc. v. Interchemical Corp., 437 F.2d 1336, 1339-40 (9th Cir. 1970) \n(same).  The criticism in Stead Motors concerned a relatively simple two-page \norder.  The concerns voiced there apply with even greater force to the full-blown \nopinion at issue here, replete with findings and conclusions on a range of issues.  \nBecause the district court merely signed the government's proposed opinion, this \nCourt should review that opinion with particular care.     \n   \n  1 9   \n\n \nB.  The Fourth Amendment Implications of Computer Searches. \nThe analysis of the government's searches of Gartenlaub's hard drives begins \nwith the principle that computers enjoy heightened protection under the Fourth \nAmendment,  because  of  the  extraordinary  volume  of  intensely  personal \ninformation they contain.  The Supreme Court's unanimous opinion in Riley v. \nCalifornia, 134 S. Ct. 2473 (2014), summarized the profound privacy concerns of \na cell phone (and, by the same logic, other modern computers): \nThe  storage  capacity  of  cell  phones  has  several  interrelated \nconsequences for privacy.  First, a cell phone collects in one place \nmany distinct types of information--an address, a note, a prescription, \na bank statement, a video--that reveal much more in combination than \nany isolated record.  Second, a cell phone's capacity allows even just \none type of information to convey far more than previously possible.  \nThe sum of an individual's private life can be reconstructed through a \nthousand photographs labeled with dates, locations, and descriptions; \nthe same cannot be said of a photograph or two of loved ones tucked \ninto a wallet.  Third, the data on a phone can date back to the purchase \nof the phone, or even earlier.  A person might carry in his pocket a \nslip of paper reminding him to call Mr. Jones; he would not carry a \nrecord of all his communications with Mr. Jones for the past several \nmonths, as would routinely be kept on a phone. \nId.  at  2489.    The  Court  observed  that  the  data  on  a  cell  phone  (or  any  other \ncomputer) differs from physical records qualitatively as well as by quantity.  As \nthe Court found, \"a cell phone search would typically expose to the government far \nmore than the most exhaustive search of a house: A phone not only contains in \ndigital form many sensitive records previously found in the home; it also contains a \n  2 0   \n\n \nbroad array of private information never found in a home in any form--unless the \nphone is.\"  Id. at 2491 (emphasis in original). \nThis  Court  as  well  has  emphasized  the  privacy  concerns  that  computer \nsearches implicate.  In United States v. Cotterman, 709 F.3d 952 (9th Cir. 2013) \n(en banc), for example, the Court observed: \nLaptop computers, iPads and the like are simultaneously offices \nand personal diaries. They contain the most intimate details of our \nlives:  financial  records,  confidential  business  documents,  medical \nrecords and private emails. This type of material implicates the Fourth \nAmendment's specific guarantee of the people's right to be secure in \ntheir \"papers.\"  U.S. Const. amend. IV.  The express listing of papers \nreflects the Founders' deep concern with safeguarding the privacy of \nthoughts and ideas--what we might call freedom of conscience--from \ninvasion by the government. \nId. at 964; see Grand Jury Subpoena v. Kitzhaber, 828 F.3d 1083, 1090 (9th Cir. \n2016) (same).  The Court added that \"[e]lectronic devices often retain sensitive and \nconfidential information far beyond the perceived point of erasure, notably in the \nform of browsing histories and records of deleted files.\"  Cotterman, 709 F.3d at \n965; see United States v. Comprehensive Drug Testing, Inc., 621 F.3d 1162, 1176 \n(9th Cir. 2010) (en banc) (noting the \"serious risk that every warrant for electronic \ninformation  will  become,  in  effect,  a  general  warrant,  rendering  the  Fourth \nAmendment irrelevant\").  \nThis  case  powerfully  implicates  the  privacy  concerns  that  Riley  and \nCotterman highlight.  Based on the entirely speculative theory that Gartenlaub was \n  2 1   \n\n \na  spy  for  China,  government  agents  secretly  entered  his  home,  imaged  his \ncomputer hard drives, and then spent months rummaging through the electronic \ndata  looking  for  evidence  of  wrongdoing.    They  did  not  find  what  they  were \nlooking  for--evidence  that  Gartenlaub  was  a  spy  for  China--but  among  the \nthousands of files they found a handful containing child pornography and thus \nlaunched this prosecution.  For the reasons outlined below, that course of action \nviolated his Fourth Amendment rights.     \nC.  The January 2014 Search Was Not Supported By Probable Cause. \nThe  government's  application  to  the  FISC  for  an  order  authorizing  the \nJanuary 2014 search of Gartenlaub's home and computers was required to include \n\"a statement of the facts and circumstances relied upon by the applicant to justify \nthe applicant's belief that . . . the target of the physical search [Gartenlaub] is . . . an \nagent of a foreign power.\"6  In turn, the FISC was required to find \"probable cause \nto believe that . . . [Gartenlaub] is . . . an agent of a foreign power.\"7 \nAn \"agent of a foreign power,\" as applied to a \"United States person\" such \nas Gartenlaub, means (as potentially relevant here) \"any person who knowingly \nengages in clandestine intelligence gathering activities for or on behalf of a foreign \npower, which activities involve or may involve a violation of the criminal statutes \n                                          \n6 50 U.S.C. § 1823(a)(3)(A); see United States v. Posey, 864 F.2d 1487, \n1490 (9th Cir. 1989). \n7 50 U.S.C. § 1824(a)(2)(A). \n  2 2   \n\n \nof the United States,\" and \"any person who knowingly aids or abets [or conspires \nwith] any person in the conduct of activities\" described above.8  \nThe government's application to the FISC to search Gartenlaub's home and \ncomputers--to the extent it was accurate and did not omit material facts--did not \nestablish probable cause to believe that he was an \"agent of a foreign power.\"  \nThere is no evidence that Gartenlaub acted \"for or on behalf of\" China, the relevant \n\"foreign  power.\"    As  the  Senate  Judiciary  Committee  explained,  \"Under  this \nstandard  the  person  to  be  [searched]  must  be  shown  to  have  a  knowing  and \nsubstantial connection with the foreign power for whom he is working.  There \nmust  be  a  principal-agent  relationship  under  which  the  alleged  agent  has \nundertaken to provide services for his foreign principal.\"  S. Rep. 95-604(I), 95th \nCong., 1st Sess. 22, reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3904, 3923.  No evidence \nsupports the theory that Gartenlaub had a \"knowing and substantial connection\" or \na \"principal-agent relationship\" with the Chinese government. \nOf  course,  the  defense  has  been  denied  access  to  the  government's \napplication to the FISC, so we cannot address its specific allegations.  But that \napplication  likely  recycled  the  \"Gartenlaub  as  spy\"  theory  that  Agent  Harris \npresented in June 2013 in his affidavit in support of the warrant for Gartenlaub's \nemails.  The Harris affidavit falls far short of establishing probable cause to believe \n                                          \n8 50 U.S.C. § 1801(b)(2)(A), (E) (ellipses omitted; emphasis added); see id. \n§ 1821(1). \n  2 3   \n\n \nthat Gartenlaub was a spy for China.  To begin with, the affidavit's premise--that \nsomeone at Boeing provided information concerning the C-17 to China--rests on \ntwo  magazine  articles  (from  Wired.com  and  aionline.com).    ER378-79.    But \nneither  article  supports  that  theory.    The  Wired.com  article  asserted  that  the \nRussian Il-76 \"seems to be the basis of the Y-20's design,\" but added that \"'Beijing \nmay  also  have  acquired  some  of  the  C-17's  blueprints  from  a  spy  working  at \nBoeing.\"  ER379.  That speculation in a magazine article--\"may also have acquired \nsome of the C-17's blueprints from a spy working at Boeing\"--hardly amounts to \nprobable cause.  The aionline.com article provides even less support for Agent \nHarris' theory; that article asserted that \"hackers\"--not an internal Boeing spy--may \nhave compromised the Boeing C-17 and other Boeing aircraft.  Id.9 \nThe Harris affidavit is no more compelling when it turns specifically to \nGartenlaub.    The  affidavit  lacks  any  evidence--because  there  is  none--that \nGartenlaub removed C-17 information from Boeing's internal computer network \nand provided that information to the Chinese government. \nLacking any such evidence, the Harris affidavit resorts to innuendo.  For \nexample, the affidavit recites various innocuous statements that Gartenlaub made \n                                          \n9 Indeed, in 2014 the government alleged that a Canadian businessman, Su \nBin, hacked into the Boeing computer system and stole military information, likely \nincluding information about the C-17.  Doc. 73 at 22-24 (describing Su Bin case \nand attaching government affidavit in support of complaint in that case).  Su Bin's \nhacking, of course, had nothing to do with Gartenlaub. \n  2 4   \n\n \nto the agents--about his interactions with Boeing security when traveling to China, \nabout the difficulty of working on classified projects with an uncleared supervisor, \nand so on--and then asserts, based on Agent Harris' \"experiences and training as an \nFBI agent\" and without further explanation, that those statements are \"suspicious in \nnature.\"    ER388-91.    The  affidavit  notes  that,  during  the  period  when  the \ninterviews  were  occurring,  Gartenlaub  received  two  emails  from  a  Boeing \nemployee \"stating that there were over 900 part files missing on the C-17 SAN, or \nStorage Area Network,\" but did not report the email to the FBI agents when they \ninterviewed him several days later.  ER388, 390, 403.  But the affidavit makes no \neffort to connect the allegedly missing part files to Gartenlaub, or to the Chinese \ngovernment, or to the new Chinese airplane.  It merely notes that Agent Harris had \nrequested additional information from Boeing on the subject and leaves the matter \nhanging.  ER404. \nThe Harris affidavit relies upon the comments of an unnamed Boeing project \nsecurity  officer.    The  officer  told  Agent  Harris  that  his  \"impression\"  was  that \nGartenlaub  \"always  felt  he  was  above  the  rules.\"    He  told  Agent  Harris  that \nGartenlaub's wife was from China and they would \"travel there to visit family.\"  At \none point, according to the officer, the rules changed, and Gartenlaub was told he \ncould not make a trip to China for which he had already bought tickets.  According \nto the officer, \"Gartenlaub told us that he canceled the trip but I always suspected \n  2 5   \n\n \nhe went anyway, but had no proof.\"  ER391-92.10  The unnamed security officer \nadded that \"nobody trusted [Gartenlaub]\" and that \"his transfer off of a sensitive \nproject and onto the C-17 was the C-17's loss and the sensitive project's gain.\"  \nER392.  It is remarkable that an American's privacy can be breached, and his home \nand  computers  secretly  ransacked,  based  on  this  sort  of  vague  character \nassassination. \nAgent Harris devotes several pages of his affidavit to the so-called \"Fish \nFork\" email.  This was an email that Gartenlaub's wife forwarded to him at his \nBoeing email address, to which he did not respond.  ER395-97.  We note below the \nmisleading  omissions  in  Agent  Harris'  description  of  the  email.    But  even  as \nportrayed in the affidavit, the email has nothing to do with the C-17 or confidential \nBoeing information and reveals no wrongdoing by Gartenlaub. \nAgent Harris describes a photo that Gartenlaub's wife sent to him in May \n2013 (in other words, after the FBI had interviewed Gartenlaub repeatedly about \nthe  C-17)  at  his  Boeing  email  address.    The  photo  (included  in  the  affidavit) \ndepicts Gartenlaub and his wife.  He is wearing \"a white collared shirt, red scarf, \n                                          \n10 Agent Harris notes that, according to a \"government database showing \nU.S.  border  crossings,\"  there  is  no  evidence  of  Gartenlaub  taking  the  trip  in \nquestion.  In other words, Gartenlaub told the security officer the truth, and the \nofficer's suspicion was unfounded--which makes one wonder why Agent Harris \nincluded it in the first place.  ER392.  Agent Harris also notes that Gartenlaub \nproperly and accurately reported to Boeing security all of his international travel, \nincluding his travel to China, with the possible exception of one entry into the \nUnited States from Canada in September 2008.  ER392-95.  \n  2 6   \n\n \nred arm sash with Chinese characters, and a black cross-body strap.\"  ER405.  \nGartenlaub's wife is dressed similarly, and, Agent Harris notes, \"[b]oth . . . are \nsmiling.\"  Id.  Based on \"open source materials\" that Agent Harris reviewed, he \nconcludes that Gartenlaub is wearing the \"typical dress uniform[] of the Young \nPioneers  of  China,\"  which  is  \"worn  by  children  commemorating  various \nnationalistic holidays in the PRC.\"  ER405-06.  The reader is left to surmise the \nsignificance of the adult Gartenlaub purportedly wearing the uniform of \"children \ncommemorating various nationalistic holidays\" in China. \nAgent Harris next turns to his \"financial investigation.\"  ER407.  He notes \nthat Gartenlaub and his wife have accounts at various financial institutions and \nthat,  over  a  three-year  period  between  August  2009  and  December  2012,  they \nmade 61 ATM deposits into their Bank of America account totaling $58,628.26.  \nThey made additional, non-ATM deposits, including a $25,000 wire transfer from \nthe Industrial Bank of China (where his wife had an account) into their joint Bank \nof America account.  ER407.  Without a shred of supporting evidence (and without \neven a rudimentary follow-up investigation), Agent Harris concludes:  \"FBI LA \nbelieves  that  Gartenlaub  and  [his  wife]  were  compensated  for  assisting  in  the \nintrusion [into Boeing's computer network] via cash payments.  FBILA believes \nGartenlaub and [his wife] have been slowly depositing the cash into multiple bank \naccounts and transferring the money to other accounts in order to hide the source \n  2 7   \n\n \nof the funds.\"  ER407.  Agent Harris does not explain why a spy receiving secret \npayments from China would deposit cash in a U.S. account, held in his own name, \nwhere it could easily be found.  And he does not offer a shred of evidence showing \nthat the money in question actually came from the Chinese government, or had \nanything to do with the alleged theft of Boeing data.  The remainder of Agent \nHarris' \"financial investigation\" rests on similar speculation and innuendo.  ER407-\n09.   \nAgent Harris' summary of the information purportedly linking Gartenlaub to \na possible compromise of C-17 information--largely a rehash of the information \ndiscussed  above--appears  at  pages  42-46  of  his  affidavit.    ER412-16.    That \ninformation, even taken at face value (which it cannot be, for reasons outlined \nbelow), falls far short of providing probable cause that Gartenlaub was a spy for \nChina.    The  application  to  the  FISC  for  an  order  authorizing  the  search  of \nGartenlaub's  home  and  computers  very  likely  relied  on  much  of  the  same \nunfounded  innuendo  and  speculation.    We  have  not  seen  that  application,  of \ncourse, because the district court refused to disclose it to the defense--but, to the \nextent it was truthful, it could not have established probable cause to believe that \nGartenlaub was an \"agent of a foreign power.\" \n   \n   \n  2 8   \n\n \n  D.  The District Court Erred in Refusing To Order a Franks Hearing. \nUnder  Franks  v.  Delaware,  438  U.S.  154  (1978),  a  court  must  hold  an \nevidentiary hearing on the veracity of a warrant affidavit if the defendant makes a \n\"substantial preliminary showing\" that the affidavit contains intentional or reckless \nfalse  statements  or  omissions  and  that  the  false  or  omitted  information  was \nmaterial to the probable cause finding.  See id. at 155-56.  Courts have repeatedly \nrecognized that Franks applies to FISA applications.  See United States v. Daoud, \n755 F.3d 479, 489 (7th Cir. 2014) (Rovner, J., concurring) (collecting cases), cert. \ndenied, 135 S. Ct. 1456 (2015).  \nThe defense could not address the allegations contained in the January 2014 \nFISA application, to which it was denied access, but it identified an astonishing \narray  of  material  falsehoods  and  omissions  in  the  June  2013  Harris  affidavit, \ncovering virtually every aspect of Agent Harris' \"Gartenlaub as spy\" theory.  Doc. \n73 at 18-34.  To cite a few examples, Agent Harris misstated Gartenlaub's access to \nthe relevant Boeing documents, Doc. 73 at 27-30; omitted information concerning \nthe Boeing employee's emails about \"missing\" files, Doc. 73 at 30-31; omitted \ninformation concerning Gartenlaub's finances that, if included, would have refuted \nthe sinister innuendo that Agent Harris sought to foster, Doc. 73 at 31-33; and \nomitted exculpatory information concerning the so-called \"Fish Fork\" email that \nGartenlaub's wife forwarded to him, including the actual email--which contains a \n  2 9   \n\n \nphotograph showing that the supposedly sensitive parts in question consist of a \ncarriage  bolt  and  a  bracket,  Doc.  73  at  34.    It  seems  highly  likely  that  the \ngovernment's  FISC  application,  submitted  just  a  few  months  after  the  Harris \naffidavit, reflects at least some of the same material falsehoods and omissions and \npossibly others.  Based on its ex parte review of the application, the district court \nshould have ordered a Franks hearing. \nE.  The January 2014 Search and Seizure Exceeded the Scope of the  \n    FISC Order Authorizing It.    \nThe FISC can only authorize the government to search for and seize \"foreign \nintelligence information.\"  50 U.S.C. §§ 1822(b), 1823(a)(6)(A), 1824(a)(4).  The \norder authorizing the January 2014 search of Gartenlaub's home and computers \npresumably  complied  with  this  restriction.    \"Foreign  intelligence  information\" \n(defined at 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801(e) and 1821(1)) does not include child pornography.  \nNonetheless,  as  detailed  in  the  government's  application  for  the  August  2014 \nsearch  warrant,  the  agents  imaged  Gartenlaub's  computers  in  their  entirety, \nreviewed  every  file,  and--upon  discovering  that  some  of  the  files  contained \npossible child pornography--subjected those and related files to detailed scrutiny, \nincluding sending them to the National Center for Exploited Children for analysis.  \nER248-56, 262-68.  In an effort to establish that Gartenlaub had downloaded the \nchild pornography, the agents also examined and analyzed a number of other files \n  3 0   \n\n \non the computers, none of which had anything to do with \"foreign intelligence \ninformation.\"  ER255-62, 268-70. \nAs far as the record shows, the agents conducted this detailed, far-ranging \nanalysis without obtaining any court authorization beyond the initial FISC order.  \nIn other words, after encountering suspected child pornography files, the agents did \nnot stop their search and seek a warrant authorizing them to open and review those \nfiles  and  other  potentially  related  files.    Instead,  they  opened,  examined,  and \nanalyzed the suspected child pornography files and a number of other files having \nnothing to do with foreign intelligence information.  They then incorporated the \nresults of that analysis into the August 2014 search warrant application.  ER248-\n49.  That application, in turn, produced the warrant that gave the agents authority \nto search for and seize the very materials that they had already seized and searched \nunder the purported authority of the January 2014 FISC order.   \nHow did agents authorized to search for \"foreign intelligence information\" \nend up opening, examining, and analyzing suspected child pornography files and a \nnumber of other files that had nothing to do with the only authorized object of the \nsearch?  The agents apparently relied on the following argument:  To determine \nwhether Gartenlaub's computers contained foreign intelligence information, it was \nnecessary to open and review every file; after all, a foreign spy might cleverly \nconceal such information in .jpg files with sex-themed names or in other non-\n  3 1   \n\n \nobvious locations.  And after opening the files, the child pornography and other \ninformation was in \"plain view\" and thus could be lawfully seized under the Fourth \nAmendment. \nThis Court, sitting en banc, confronted a similar government argument in \nUnited States v. Comprehensive Drug Testing, Inc., 621 F.3d 1162 (9th Cir. 2010) \n(en banc).  In that case, agents had warrants authorizing the seizure of drug testing \nrecords  relating  to  ten  named  baseball  players.    In  the  course  of  the  search, \nhowever, the agents encountered records relating to a number of other players.  \nThey seized and examined those records, relying on the plain view exception to the \nFourth Amendment.  Three district courts rejected the government's position and \nfound that the search and seizure of the other players' records violated the Fourth \nAmendment.  This Court affirmed. \nThe Court recognized that law enforcement officers searching a computer \nfor a particular, limited category of evidence may have to review every file to \nensure that evidence in that category has not been concealed.  See id. at 1176.  But \nthe Court cautioned that the need for comprehensive review, coupled with the plain \nview doctrine, \"creates a serious risk that every warrant for electronic information \nwill  become,  in  effect,  a  general  warrant,  rendering  the  Fourth  Amendment \nirrelevant.\"  Id.  The Court concluded with the warning that \"[t]he process of \nsegregating electronic data that is seizable from that which is not must not become \n  3 2   \n\n \na vehicle for the government to gain access to data which it has no probable cause \nto  collect.\"    Id.  at  1177;  see,  e.g.,  Kitzhaber,  828  F.3d  at  1090  (noting  that \nsubpoena  for  emails  \"will,  if  complied  with,  allow  federal  government  agents \nseeking out the messages that bear relevance to their investigation to peruse all \nmanner of private communications that do not\"). \nIn a concurrence, Chief Judge Kozinski, joined by Judges Kleinfeld, W. \nFletcher,  Paez,  and  M.  Smith,  went  further  in  providing  guidance  for  future \ncomputer searches.  As relevant here, the concurrence declared: \n  When the government wishes to obtain a warrant to examine a \ncomputer hard drive or electronic storage medium to search for certain \nincriminating files, or when a search for evidence could result in the \nseizure of a computer . . . magistrate judges should insist that the \ngovernment  forswear  reliance  on  the  plain  view  doctrine.    They \nshould also require the government to forswear reliance on any similar \ndoctrine that would allow retention of data obtained only because the \ngovernment  was  required  to  segregate  seizable  from  non-seizable \ndata.  This will ensure that future searches of electronic records do not \n\"make a mockery of [United States v. Tamura, 694 F.2d 591 (9th Cir. \n1982]--indeed,  the  Fourth  Amendment--by  turning  all  warrants  for \ndigital  data  into  general  warrants.  .  .  .  If  the  government  doesn't \nconsent to such a waiver, the magistrate judge should order that the \nseizable and non-seizable data be separated by an independent third \nparty  under  the supervision  of  the  court,  or  deny  the  warrant \naltogether. \nId. at 1178 (Kozinski, J., concurring). \nThe opinions in Comprehensive Drug Testing leave no doubt that this Court \ndisfavors routine application of the plain view doctrine in the context of computer \nsearches, because of the danger of turning every computer warrant into a forbidden \n  3 3   \n\n \ngeneral warrant.  See, e.g., United States v. Flores, 802 F.3d 1028, 1045 (9th Cir. \n2015) (\"We also cautioned in CDT against retaining unresponsive data based on \nthe 'plain view' doctrine, and recognized the importance of protecting third parties' \nrights.\"), cert. denied, 137 S. Ct. 36 (2016).  The Comprehensive Drug Testing \nmajority addresses this problem through strict segregation of material within the \nscope of the warrant, while the concurrence would preclude use of the plain view \ndoctrine entirely in the computer search context.  It is quite clear that neither the \nmajority nor the concurrence (nor perhaps even the dissent) would approve what \noccurred here:  a FISC order authorizing a computer search for a limited category \nof  information--\"foreign  intelligence  information\"--becomes  the  basis  for  the \ngovernment  to  seize,  open,  examine,  and  analyze  hundreds  of  files  that  have \nabsolutely nothing to do with such information. \nIn its opposition to Gartenlaub's bail motion, government cited United States \nv. Giberson, 527 F.3d 882 (9th Cir. 2008), and United States v. Nessland, 601 Fed. \nAppx. 576 (9th Cir. 2015) (unpublished).  In both of those cases, however, the \nagents limited themselves to searching for the items specified in the warrant; they \nhappened upon child pornography inadvertently; and before continuing to search \nfor  and  seize  the  child  pornography,  they  obtained  a  separate  warrant.    See \nNessland, 601 Fed. Appx. at 576 (upon coming across child pornography images in \nplain view, agents \"stopped their search, and did not return to it until they obtained \n  3 4   \n\n \nanother warrant that covered the new type of images\"); Giberson, 527 F.3d at 890 \n(searching agent \"inadvertently\" came across child pornography and government \n\"only  searched  for  child  pornography  after  obtaining  the  .  .  .  search  warrant \nauthorizing it to do so\").   \nHere, by contrast with Nessland and Giberson, the searching agents did not \nstop  their  search  and  obtain  a  new  warrant  before  searching  for,  seizing,  and \nexamining child pornography.  Instead, based solely on the January 2014 FISC \norder  and  before  obtaining  the  August  2014  warrant,  the  agents  conducted  a \ndetailed examination of the child pornography files, including sending them to the \nNational Center for Exploited Children for analysis.  ER248-56, 262-68.  In an \neffort  to  establish  that  Gartenlaub  had  downloaded  the  child  pornography,  the \nagents also examined and analyzed a number of other files on the computers, none \nof which had anything to do with \"foreign intelligence information.\"  ER255-62, \n268-70.  Thus, even if Giberson and Nessland can be reconciled with the en banc \ndecision in Comprehensive Drug Testing, they do not come close to supporting \nwhat the government did here. \nBecause Gartenlaub's counsel did not raise this issue in the district court, \nreview is for plain error.  That standard is satisfied here.  In light of Comprehensive \nDrug Testing, the search for and seizure of child pornography files was error; that \nerror  was  plain;  it  affected  Gartenlaub's  \"substantial  rights\"  under  the  Fourth \n  3 5   \n\n \nAmendment; and permitting such patently unlawful government action to stand \nwould \"seriously affect[] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial \nproceedings.\"  Flyer, 633 F.3d at 917 (quotation omitted). \nIV.  THE  DISTRICT  COURT  ERRED  IN  REFUSING  TO  ORDER \n  DISCLOSURE OF THE FISC APPLICATION AND ORDER.  \nIn its government-drafted order, the district court denied the defense access \nto the government's application to the FISC and to the FISC order authorizing the \nJanuary  2014  search  of  Gartenlaub's  home  and  computers.    ER25,  27-28.    As \ndemonstrated below, the district court erred.  Disclosure was both \"necessary to \nmake an accurate determination of the legality of the physical search,\" 50 U.S.C. § \n1825(g), and required as a matter of due process.   \nA.  Standard of Review. \n Courts review for abuse of discretion a district court's decision whether to \norder disclosure of FISA applications and orders.  See, e.g., United States v. El-\nMezain, 664 F.3d 467, 567 (5th Cir. 2011).  To the extent the court's ruling turns \non questions of statutory interpretation, review is de novo. \nB.  The Meaning of the Term \"Necessary.\" \nThe district court's order does not analyze the language, legislative history, \nand statutory purposes of the FISA disclosure provisions, 50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(f) and \n1825(g).  The government routinely argues, however, that the plain meaning of the \nphrase \"necessary to make an accurate determination of the legality of the physical \n  3 6   \n\n \nsearch\"  in  50  U.S.C.  §  1825(g)  (and  the  similar  phrase  in  §  1806(f))  forbids \ndisclosure  unless  essential  or  indispensable  to  the  district  court's  ruling  on  a \nsuppression  motion.    That  is  wrong.    Analysis  of  the  legislative  history  and \nstatutory purpose demonstrates that disclosure is \"necessary\" under §§ 1806(f) and \n1825(g) when it would substantially promote an accurate determination of legality.  \nThat is certainly the case here, especially with respect to the Franks issue.   \nTo begin, the word \"necessary\" has no plain meaning.  As the D.C. Circuit \nhas observed, \"The term 'necessary' is a chameleon-like word whose meaning . . . \nmay be influenced by its context . . . .  [It] is not language of plain meaning.\"  \nCellco Partnership v. FCC, 357 F.3d 88, 96-97 (D.C. Cir. 2004)).  Courts have \nfrequently interpreted \"necessary\" to mean \"less than absolutely essential, and have \nexplicitly  found  that  a  measure  may  be  'necessary'  even  though  acceptable \nalternatives have not been exhausted.\"  CT&IA v. FCC, 330 F.3d 502, 510 (D.C. \nCir. 2003) (quotation omitted).  In Commissioner v. Tellier, 383 U.S. 687 (1966), \nfor example, the Supreme Court found that the word \"necessary\" in the phrase \n\"ordinary  and  necessary  [business]  expenses\"  imposes  \"only  the  minimal \nrequirement that the expense be appropriate and helpful for the development of the \ntaxpayer's business.\"  Id. at 689 (quotations and brackets omitted); see, e.g., Snider \nv. United States, 468 F.3d 500, 513 (8th Cir. 2006) (interpreting \"necessary\" in 26 \nU.S.C. § 6103; court rejects \"strictly essential\" and holds that the \"'appropriate or \n  3 7   \n\n \nhelpful' meaning of 'necessary' is the only practical interpretation in this context\"); \nPrometheus  Radio  Project  v.  FCC,  373  F.3d  372,  393-94  (3d  Cir.  2004) \n(interpreting \"necessary\" in § 202(h) of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to \nmean \"'convenient,' 'useful,' or 'helpful,' not 'essential' or 'indispensable'\"); FTC v. \nRockefeller,  591  F.2d  182,  188  (2d  Cir.  1979)  (interpreting  \"necessary\"  in  15 \nU.S.C. § 46; court holds that FTC's authority to conduct an ancillary investigation \nof a bank when \"necessary\" did not require investigation to be \"absolutely needed\" \nor \"inescapable,\" but instead that it \"arise reasonably and logically out of the main \ninvestigation\"). \nThese cases confirm that the word \"necessary\" in §§ 1806(f) and 1825(g) \ndoes not plainly mean essential or indispensable.  Instead, the term must be read in \nlight  of  the  legislative  history  of  FISA  and  the  statutory  purposes.    These \ninterpretive  aids  demonstrate  that,  in  this  context,  \"necessary\"  means  that \ndisclosure would substantially promote the accuracy of the court's determination of \nlegality.   \nTwo authoritative Senate Reports--one from the Senate Judiciary Committee \nand  the  other  from  the  Senate  Intelligence  Committee--discuss  in  detail  the \nprovisions that became § 1806.  The Reports observe: \nThe  extent  to  which  the  government  should  be  required  to \nsurrender  to  the  parties  in  a  criminal  trial  the  underlying \ndocumentation used to justify electronic surveillance raises delicate \nproblems and competing interests.  On the one hand, broad rights of \n  3 8   \n\n \naccess to the documentation and subsequent intelligence information \ncan threaten the secrecy necessary to effective intelligence practices.  \nHowever, the defendant's constitutional guarantee of a fair trial could \nseriously be undercut if he is denied the materials needed to present a \nproper defense.  The Committee believes that a just, effective balance \nhas been struck in this section. \nS. Rep. 604(I), 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 53, reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3904, \n3954;  see  S.  Rep.  701,  95th  Cong.,  1st  Sess.  59  (similar  passage  in  Senate \nIntelligence  Committee  Report),  reprinted  in  1978  U.S.C.C.A.N.  3973,  4028.  \nTurning  to  §  1806(f),  the  Committees  summed  up  the  disclosure  provision  as \nfollows: \nThe committee views the procedures set forth in this subsection \nas  striking  a  reasonable  balance  between  an  entirely  in  camera \nproceeding  which  might  adversely  affect  the  defendant's  ability  to \ndefend himself, and mandatory disclosure, which might occasionally \nresult  in  the  wholesale  revelation  of  sensitive  foreign  intelligence \ninformation. \n  The decision whether it is necessary to order disclosure \nto a person is for the Court to make after reviewing the underlying \ndocumentation  and  determining  its  volume,  scope  and  complexity.  \nThe committee has noted the reasoned discussion of these matters in \nthe opinion of the Court in United States v. Butenko, [494 F.2d 593 \n(3d Cir. 1974) (en banc)].  There, the Court, faced with the difficult \nproblem of determining what standard to follow in balancing national \nsecurity interests with the right to a fair trial stated:   \n  \"The  distinguished  district  court  judge  reviewed  in \ncamera the records of the wiretaps at issue here before holding the \nsurveillances to be legal . . . Since the question confronting the district \ncourt as to the second set of interceptions was the legality of the taps, \nnot the existence of tainted evidence, it was within his discretion to \ngrant  or  deny  Ivanov's  request  for  disclosure  and  a  hearing.    The \nexercise of this discretion is to be guided by an evaluation of the \ncomplexity of the factors to be considered by the court and by the \n  3 9   \n\n \nlikelihood that adversary presentation would substantially promote a \nmore accurate decision.\"  (494 F.2d at 607.) \n  Thus,  in  some  cases,  the  Court  will  likely  be  able  to \ndetermine the legality of the surveillance without any disclosure to the \ndefendant.    In  other  cases,  however,  the  question  may  be  more \ncomplex  because  of,  for  example,  indications  of  possible \nmisrepresentation of fact, vague identification of the persons to be \nsurveilled or surveillance records which includes [sic] a significant \namount of nonforeign intelligence information, calling into question \ncompliance with the minimization standards contained in the order.  \nIn such cases, the committee contemplates that the court will likely \ndecide to order disclosure to the defendant, in whole or in part since \nsuch disclosure \"is necessary to make an accurate determination of the \nlegality of the surveillance.\" [Footnote omitted.] \n  Cases may arise, of course, where the Court believes that \ndisclosure is necessary to make an accurate determination of legality, \nbut the Government argues that to do so, even given the Court's broad \ndiscretionary  power  to  excise  certain  sensitive  portions,  would \ndamage national security.  In such situations the Government must \nchoose--either  disclose  the  material  or  forego  the  use  of  the \nsurveillance-based evidence.  Indeed, if the Government objects to the \ndisclosure,  thus  preventing  a  proper  adjudication  of  legality,  the \nprosecution would probably have to be dismissed . . . . \nS. Rep. 604(I), supra, at 58-59 (footnote omitted; ellipsis in original), reprinted in \n1978  U.S.C.C.A.N.  at  3959-60;  see  S.  Rep.  701,  supra,  at  64-65  (identical \nlanguage  in  Senate  Intelligence  Committee  Report),  reprinted  in  1978 \nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 4033-44. \nSeveral points are evident from this passage.  First, the Senate Judiciary and \nIntelligence Committees plainly did not intend to erect an insuperable barrier to \ndisclosure.  To the contrary, in choosing a balanced approach, the Committees \nspecifically eschewed \"an entirely in camera proceeding.\" \n  4 0   \n\n \nSecond, the Committees--through their reliance on Butenko--suggest that the \n\"necessary\"  standard  is  met  when  the  district  court  determines  that  \"adversary \npresentation would substantially promote a more accurate decision.\"  \nThird, the Committees noted the district court's \"broad discretionary power \nto excise certain sensitive portions\" from the FISA materials before disclosure.  \nThis recognition of the district court's inherent power to take necessary protective \nmeasures finds a statutory basis both in § 1806(f) itself and in CIPA (discussed \nbelow).  That power substantially ameliorates any national security concerns.   \nFinally, the Senate Judiciary and Intelligence Committees contemplated--\nand did not shy away from--the possibility that the court would order disclosure, \nthe  government  would  refuse  to  comply,  and  the  court  would  suppress  the \nsurveillance or dismiss the prosecution.  Just as Congress did in CIPA, 18 U.S.C. \nApp. 3 § 6(e), the Committees left the choice with the government:  either comply \nwith the disclosure order or refuse and suffer appropriate sanctions.       \nTwo other portions of the legislative history are relevant as well.  First, an \nearly version of the definition of \"foreign intelligence information\" included the \nwords \"necessary\" and \"essential.\"  \"Necessary,\" according to the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, \"requires more than a showing that the information would be useful or \nconvenient.\"  S. Rep. 604(I), supra, at 31, reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3933.  \n\"Essential\" requires \"a showing that the information is important and required but \n  4 1   \n\n \nnot that it is of utmost importance or indispensable.\"  Id.  Thus, \"necessary\" merely \nmeant  something  more  than  \"useful  or  convenient,\"  and  not  even  \"essential\" \nrequired a showing that information was \"indispensable.\"   \nThe  Senate  Intelligence  Committee  deleted  \"essential\"  from  the  final \ndefinition of \"foreign intelligence information\" (codified at 50 U.S.C. § 1801(e)).  \nThe Intelligence Committee declared that by the term \"necessary,\" it \"intends to \nrequire more than a showing that the information would be useful or convenient.  \nThe  committee  intends  to  require  that  the  information  is  both  important  and \nrequired.  The use of this standard is intended to mandate that a significant need be \ndemonstrated  by  those  seeking  the  surveillance.\"    S.  Rep.  701,  supra,  at  31 \n(emphasis added), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 4000.   \nSecond,  the  minimization  procedures  in  50  U.S.C.  §  1801(h)(2)  bar \ndissemination of nonpublicly available information in a manner that identifies any \nUnited States person without the person's consent, \"unless such person's identity is \nnecessary to understand foreign intelligence information or assess its importance.\"  \nThe House Conference Report explains that \"[b]y 'necessary' the conferees do not \nmean that the identity must be essential to understand the information or assess its \nimportance.    The  word  necessary  requires  that  a  knowledgeable  intelligence \nanalyst make a determination that the identity will contribute in a meaningful way \nto the ability of the recipient of the information to understand the information or \n  4 2   \n\n \nassess its importance.\"  H. Conf. Rep. 1720, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 23 (Oct. 5, \n1978).        \nThe use of \"necessary\" in §§ 1801(e) and 1801(h)(2) sheds light on the \nword's meaning in §§ 1806(f) and 1825(g).  As the Supreme Court has observed, \n\"[I]dentical words and phrases within the same statute should normally be given \nthe same meaning.\"  Hall v. United States, 566 U.S. 506, 519 (2012) (quotation \nomitted).  Under this principle, the meanings ascribed to \"necessary\" in §§ 1801(e), \n1801(h)(2), 1806(f), and 1825(g) should be the same, absent an indication to the \ncontrary.  And, according to the legislative history, the meanings are very similar:  \n\"significant need\" in § 1801(e), \"contribute in a meaningful way\" in § 1801(h)(2), \nand \"substantially promote\" in § 1806(f) and § 1825(g).  \nA court must construe a statutory term \"in a manner consistent with the \n[statute's] purpose.\"  Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U.S. 105, 118 (2001); \nsee,  e.g.,  Yates  v.  United  States,  135  S.  Ct.  1074,  1081-82  (2015)  (plurality \nopinion)  (looking  to  \"broader  context  of  the  statute  as  a  whole\"  to  determine \nmeaning of statutory phrase) (quotation omitted).  FISA \"was enacted to create a \nframework  whereby  the  Executive  could  conduct  electronic  surveillance  for \nforeign intelligence purposes without violating the rights of citizens.\"11  The Act \n                                          \n11 United States v. Hammoud, 381 F.3d 316, 332 (4th Cir. 2004) (en banc), \nvacated on other grounds, 543 U.S. 1097 (2005), reinstated in relevant part, 405 \nF.3d 1034 (4th Cir. 2005) (en banc). \n  4 3   \n\n \n\"was intended to strike a sound balance between the need for such surveillance and \nthe protection of civil liberties.\"12  Interpreting \"necessary\" in § 1806(f) and § \n1825(g) to mean \"substantially promote\" is fully consistent with FISA's effort to \nbalance civil liberties and the need for surveillance. \nInterpreting  \"necessary\"  so  strictly  that  disclosure  never  occurs--the \ngovernment's favored--does nothing to advance civil liberties.  To the contrary, a \nsystem that operates in secret, with no adversarial input, as the FISA process has \nfunctioned for 39 years, is almost certain to breed abuse.  The stark fact is that the \nFISA system, interpreted by the courts to require ex parte proceedings in every \ncase and never to grant defense counsel access to FISA applications and orders, \nhas  failed  to  protect  civil  liberties.    Interpreting  §§  1806(f)  and  1825(g)  as \nCongress  intended,  to  permit  disclosure  when  adversarial  proceedings  will \nsubstantially promote the accuracy of the district court's determination, marks an \nimportant step toward restoring the balance that Congress sought to strike in 1978. \n                                          \n12 In re Kevork, 788 F.2d 566, 569 (9th Cir. 1986) (quotation omitted); see, \ne.g., S. Rep. 604(I), supra, at 4 (Senate Judiciary Committee Report notes Attorney \nGeneral Griffin Bell's view that \"this bill strikes the balance, sacrifices neither our \nsecurity nor our civil liberties, and assures that the abuses of the past will remain in \nthe past . . . .\"), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3905-06; id. at 7 (bill \"goes a \nlong way in striking a fair and just balance between protection of national security \nand protection of personal liberties\"), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3908; id. \nat 9 (\"Striking a sound balance between the need for such surveillance and the \nprotection  of  civil  liberties  lies  at  the  heart  of  S.  1566.\"),  reprinted  in  1978 \nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 3910; S. Rep. 701, supra, at 7, 16 (Senate Intelligence Committee \nReport with similar remarks), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3975, 3985.   \n  4 4   \n\n \nC.  Disclosure Is \"Necessary\" Here, Particularly for the Franks Issue. \nThe need to interpret the disclosure provisions of FISA as Congress intended \nis particularly stark when--as here--a defendant challenges a FISC order under \nFranks.    Without  access  to  the  underlying  applications,  orders,  and  related \nmaterials (affidavits accompanying the applications, for example), the defense can \nonly speculate; it cannot identify specific falsehoods or omissions to make the \n\"substantial preliminary showing\" that Franks requires for an evidentiary hearing.  \n438 U.S. at 155-56.  As Judge Ilana Rovner recently acknowledged, \"Thirty-six \nyears  after  the  enactment  of  FISA,  it  is  well  past  time  to  recognize  that  it  is \nvirtually  impossible  for  a  FISA  defendant  to  make  the  showing  that  Franks \nrequires in order to convene an evidentiary hearing.\"  United States v. Daoud, 755 \nF.3d 479, 496 (7th Cir. 2014) (Rovner, J., concurring), cert. denied, 135 S. Ct. \n1456 (2015).  Judge Rovner added:  \nA  Franks  motion  is  premised  on  material  misrepresentations  and \nomissions in the warrant affidavit; but without access to that affidavit, \na defendant cannot identify such misrepresentations or omissions, let \nalone establish that they were intentionally or recklessly made.  As a \npractical matter, the secrecy shrouding the FISA process renders it \nimpossible for a defendant to meaningfully obtain relief under Franks \nabsent a patent inconsistency in the FISA application itself or a sua \nsponte  disclosure  by  the  government  that  the  FISA  application \ncontained a material misstatement or omission.   \nId.  at  486  (Rovner,  J.,  concurring).    The  district  court,  lacking  access  to  the \ndiscovery, to the information the defense possesses through its own knowledge and \n  4 5   \n\n \ninvestigation, and to investigative resources, cannot assess on its own whether the \napplications  contain  falsehoods,  or  whether  they  omit  information  that  would \nchange the probable cause assessment.  See id. (\"[T]he court, which does have \naccess to the application, cannot, for the most part, independently evaluate the \naccuracy of that application on its own without the defendant's knowledge of the \nunderlying facts.\").   \nJudge Rovner recognized that \"Franks serves as an indispensable check on \npotential abuses of the warrant process, and means must be found to keep Franks \nfrom becoming a dead letter in the FISA context.\"  Id.  Those \"means\" are readily \navailable here:  provide defense counsel access to the FISA applications, orders, \nand other materials, as Congress intended. \nThe government invariably resists disclosure of FISA materials to defense \ncounsel on the ground that any disclosure of FISA materials, ever, to any defense \ncounsel,  under  any  circumstances,  will  cause  irreparable  damage  to  national \nsecurity.  The Senate Judiciary and Intelligence Committees did not accept that \nview in 1978, as their Reports confirm.  As we discuss below, the argument is even \nmore clearly wrong now, following the enactment of the Classified Information \nProcedures Act in 1980 (two years after the enactment of FISA) and the extensive \nexperience that courts, prosecutors, and defense counsel have had with the statute \nsince then.  Through the use of \"appropriate security procedures and protective \n  4 6   \n\n \norders,\"  50  U.S.C.  §§  1806(f),  1825(g),  including  the  procedures  that  CIPA \nprovides, a district court can order disclosure in a manner that adequately protects \nlegitimate national security concerns.    \nD.  Disclosure Is Required as a Matter of Due Process. \nProduction of the FISA application, order, and related materials is required \nas well under 50 U.S.C. § 1825(h) and the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause.13    \nTo  determine  whether  due  process  requires  disclosure,  the  Court  must \nconsider the three factors set forth in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976):  \n(1) \"the private interest that will be affected by the official action,\" (2) \"the risk of \nan erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used\" and \"the \nprobable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards,\" and (3) \n\"the  Government's  interest,  including  the  function  involved  and  the  fiscal  and \nadministrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirements \nwould entail.\"  Id. at 335; see, e.g., American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee \nv.  Reno,  70  F.3d  1045,  1068-71  (9th  Cir.  1995)  (applying  Mathews  test  to \ndetermine whether use of secret evidence violates due process); Rafeedie v. INS, \n880 F.2d 506, 524-25 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (Mathews balancing test governs process \n                                          \n13 Section 1825(h) provides in relevant part that \"[i]f the court determines \nthat the physical search was lawfully authorized or conducted, it shall deny the \nmotion  of  the  aggrieved  person  except  to  the  extent  that  due  process  requires \ndiscovery or disclosure.\"  50 U.S.C. § 1825(h) (emphasis added).  Section 1806(g) \ncontains a similar provision.  \n  4 7   \n\n \ndue alien in exclusion proceeding, including use of secret evidence), on remand, \n795  F.  Supp.  13,  18-20  (D.D.C.  1992)  (same);  Kindhearts  for  Charitable \nHumanitarian Development, Inc. v. Geithner, 710 F. Supp. 2d 637, 659 (N.D. Ohio \n2010) (\"Courts have found that their duty to protect individual rights extends to \nrequiring disclosure of classified information to give a party an ability to respond \nto allegations made against it.\"); Kiareldeen v. Reno, 71 F. Supp. 2d 402, 413-14 \n(D.N.J. 1999) (same).  Application of the Mathews test confirms that Gartenlaub \nmust be granted access to the FISA materials as a matter of due process.   \nFirst, Gartenlaub's \"private interests\" here are extremely weighty.  He seeks \nan accurate determination of his claim that the government's secret search of his \nhome and computers violated his rights under FISA and the Fourth Amendment.  \nHe  seeks  to  vindicate  his  constitutionally  protected  right  to  privacy.    More \ngenerally, he seeks through the processes of this Court to avoid deprivation of his \nliberty.  If mere property interests \"weigh heavily in the Mathews balance,\" as the \nSupreme Court has held, United States v. James Daniel Good Real Property, 510 \nU.S. 43, 54-55 (1993), Gartenlaub's privacy and liberty interests have even greater \nsignificance. \nTurning  to  the  second  Mathews  factor,  the  adjudication  of  Gartenlaub''s \nrights under FISA and the Fourth Amendment through ex parte review of materials \nthat his counsel had no opportunity to examine or challenge carries a notoriously \n  4 8   \n\n \nsignificant \"risk of an erroneous deprivation\" of the liberty interests at issue, and \n\"additional  .  .  .  procedural  safeguards\"--access  to  the  FISA  materials  and  an \nopportunity to address them--carry substantial \"probable value.\"  Mathews, 424 \nU.S.  at  335.    The  Supreme  Court  has  declared  that  \"'[f]airness  can  rarely  be \nobtained by secret, one-sided determination of facts decisive of rights. . . .  No \nbetter instrument has been devised for arriving at truth than to give a person in \njeopardy of serious loss notice of the case against him and opportunity to meet it.'\"  \nJames Daniel Good, 510 U.S. at 55 (quoting Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee \nv. McGrath, 341 U.S. 123, 170-72 (1951) (Frankfurter, J., concurring)).  As this \nCourt observed in a secret evidence case, \"'One would be hard pressed to design a \nprocedure  more  likely  to  result  in  erroneous  deprivations.'  .  .  .    [T]he  very \nfoundation of the adversary process assumes that use of undisclosed information \nwill  violate  due  process  because  of  the  risk  of  error.\"    American-Arab  Anti-\nDiscrimination Committee, 70 F.3d at 1069 (quoting district court); see, e.g., id. at \n1070 (noting \"enormous risk of error\" in use of secret evidence); Kiareldeen, 71 F. \nSupp. 2d at 412-14 (same). \nIn the Fourth Amendment context, the Supreme Court has twice rejected the \nuse of ex parte proceedings on grounds that apply equally here.  In Alderman v. \nUnited  States,  394  U.S.  165  (1969),  the  Court  addressed  the  procedures  to  be \nfollowed in determining whether government eavesdropping in violation of the \n  4 9   \n\n \nFourth  Amendment  contributed  to  its  case  against  the  defendants.    The  Court \nrejected the government's suggestion that the district court make that determination \nex parte and in camera.  The Court observed that  \n[a]n apparently innocent phrase, a chance remark, a reference to what \nappears to be a neutral person or event, the identity of a caller or the \nindividual on the other end of a telephone, or even the manner of \nspeaking or using words may have special significance to one who \nknows  the  more  intimate  facts  of  an  accused's  life.    And  yet  that \ninformation may be wholly colorless and devoid of meaning to one \nless well acquainted with all relevant circumstances. \nId. at 182.  In ordering disclosure of improperly recorded conversations, the Court \ndeclared: \nAdversary proceedings will not magically eliminate all error, but they \nwill  substantially  reduce  its  incidence  by  guarding  against  the \npossibility that the trial judge, through lack of time or unfamiliarity \nwith the information contained in and suggested by the materials, will \nbe  unable  to  provide  the  scrutiny  that  the  Fourth  Amendment \nexclusionary rule demands. \nId. at 184. \nSimilarly, the Court held in Franks that a defendant must be permitted to \nattack the veracity of the affidavit underlying a search warrant, upon a preliminary \nshowing of an intentional or reckless material falsehood.  The Court rested its \ndecision in significant part on the ex parte nature of the procedure for issuing a \nsearch warrant and the value of adversarial proceedings: \n[T]he hearing before the magistrate [when the warrant is issued] not \nalways will suffice to discourage lawless or reckless misconduct.  The \npre-search proceeding is necessarily ex parte, since the subject of the \n  5 0   \n\n \nsearch cannot be tipped off to the application for a warrant lest he \ndestroy or remove evidence.  The usual reliance of our legal system \non  adversary  proceedings  itself  should  be  an  indication  that  an  ex \nparte inquiry is likely to be less vigorous.  The magistrate has no \nacquaintance with the information that may contradict the good faith \nand  reasonable  basis  of  the  affiant's  allegations.    The  pre-search \nproceeding  will  frequently  be  marked  by  haste,  because  of  the \nunderstandable  desire  to  act  before  the  evidence  disappears;  this \nurgency will not always permit the magistrate to make an independent \nexamination of the affiant or other witnesses. \n438 U.S. at 169. \nThe  same  considerations  that  the  Supreme  Court  found  compelling  in \nAlderman and Franks militate against ex parte procedures in the FISA context.  As \nthe FISC itself has acknowledged, for example, without adversarial proceedings, \nsystematic executive branch misconduct–-including submission of dozens of FISA \napplications with \"erroneous statements\" and \"omissions of material facts\"--went \nentirely undetected by the courts until the DOJ chose to reveal it.  See In re All \nMatters, 218 F. Supp. 2d 611, 620-21 (FISC), rev'd, 310 F.3d 717 (FISCR 2002).14  \nIn 2009, the FISC declared itself \"deeply troubled\" by incidents in which the NSA \nviolated the court's orders.  It noted that those incidents \"occurred only a few \nweeks following the completion of an 'end to end review' by the government of \nNSA's procedures and processes for handling the BR metadata, and its submission \n                                          \n14 The FISC was sufficiently alarmed by these erroneous applications that it \n\"decided  not  to  accept  inaccurate  affidavits  from  FBI  agents  whether  or  not \nintentionally false,\" and \"[o]ne FBI agent was barred from appearing before the \nCourt as a FISA affiant.\"  In re All Matters, 218 F. Supp. 2d at 621. \n  5 1   \n\n \nof a report intended to assure the Court that NSA had addressed and corrected the \nissues giving rise to the history of serious and widespread compliance problems in \nthis matter and had taken the necessary steps to ensure compliance with the Court's \norders going forward.\"  In re FBI, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 132935, at *4 (FISC \nSept. 25, 2009).  And again in 2011, the FISC was \"troubled that the government's \nrevelations  regarding  NSA's  acquisition  of  Internet  transactions  mark  the  third \ninstance  in  less  than  three  years  in  which  the  government  has  disclosed  a \nsubstantial misrepresentation regarding the scope of a major collection program.\"  \n[Redacted], 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157706, at *20 n.14 (FISC Oct. 3, 2011).   \nThree stark statistics underscore the dysfunction of the current FISA system:  \n(1)  year  in  and  year  out,  the  FISC  approves  without  modification  the \noverwhelming  majority  of  the  FISA  applications  the  government  presents  and \nrejects only a tiny handful--if that--out of more than a thousand;15 (2) no court has \never  granted  defense  counsel  access  to  FISA  applications  and  orders  under  § \n1806(f) and § 1825(g), so no adversarial eye has ever scrutinized them; and (3) no \n                                          \n15  According  to  the  Attorney  General's  annual  reports  (available  at \nhttp://fas.org/irp/agency/doj/fisa),  since  1978  the  FISC  has  approved  (either  as \nsubmitted  or  with  modifications)  well  over  20,000  applications  or  extensions \nauthorizing FISA surveillance, more than 99% of the total applications submitted.  \nThe FISC has rejected outright only a handful of applications, and the DOJ has \nsuccessfully resubmitted some of those.  The statistics for 2015 are typical:  the \ngovernment made 1,499 applications for electronic surveillance; none were denied \nin  whole  or  in  part;  the  government  withdrew  one  application;  and  the  FISC \nmodified the proposed order in 80 applications.    \n  5 2   \n\n \ncourt has ever granted a motion to suppress the fruits of FISA surveillance.  As \nthese  statistics  suggest,  ex  parte  review  does  not  adequately  protect  the \nsurveillance  target's  constitutional  and  statutory  rights.    The  \"additional  .  .  . \nprocedural safeguards\" that Gartenlaub requests--access to the FISA materials and \nan opportunity to address them-–thus carry substantial \"probable value.\"  Mathews, \n424 U.S. at 335. \nFinally,  the  Court  must  consider  the  government's  purported  interest  in \nmaintaining the secrecy of the FISA materials.  The government typically asserts \nits  generalized  interest  in  avoiding  damage  to  \"national  security,\"  without  any \neffort  to  demonstrate  that  disclosure  of  the  FISA  materials  to  defense  counsel \nunder  the  circumstances  of  this  case  would  cause  such  damage.    Courts  have \npreviously  rejected  such  diffuse  claims  of  national  security.    See,  e.g.,  Arab-\nAmerican Anti-Discrimination Committee, 70 F.3d at 1070 (\"We cannot in good \nconscience find that the President's broad generalization regarding a distant foreign \npolicy concern and a related national security threat suffices to support a process \nthat is inherently unfair because of the enormous risk of error and the substantial \npersonal interests involved.\"); Kiareldeen, 71 F. Supp. 2d at 414 (same); Rafeedie, \n795 F. Supp. at 19 (same).   \nThe government's asserted national security interest in withholding the FISA \nmaterials from the defense is particularly weak in light of the protections available \n  5 3   \n\n \nunder CIPA.  Most critically, CIPA provides for entry of a protective order.16  The \nCIPA  protective  order--the  standard  terms  of  which  are  largely  settled  after \ndecades  of  experience--sets  the  conditions  under  which  defense  counsel  may \nreview classified discovery, requires defense counsel and staff to have security \nclearances,  establishes  procedures  for  filing  classified  pleadings,  and  prohibits \nanyone  associated  with  the  defense  from  revealing  publicly  the  classified \ninformation to which access is granted.  See, e.g., United States v. Gowadia, 2010 \nU.S.  Dist.  LEXIS  80572  (D.  Haw.  May  8,  2010)  (entering  a  typical  CIPA \nprotective order).   \nCIPA § 4 governs classified discovery.  That provision allows the court to \nauthorize  the  government,  \"upon  a  sufficient  showing,\"  to  delete  classified \ninformation  from  the  discovery  it  provides  or  to  furnish  substitutions  for  the \nclassified information in the form of summaries or admissions.  The statute adds \nthat  \"[t]he  court  may  permit  the  United  States  to  make  a  request  for  such \nauthorization in the form of a written statement to be inspected by the court alone.\"  \n18 U.S.C. App. 3 § 4. \nCIPA has been in existence for 37 years.  During that time huge volumes of \nenormously sensitive classified information have been made available under its \nstrict security measures to cleared defense counsel in scores of federal criminal \n                                          \n16 18 U.S.C. App. 3 § 3.  \n  5 4   \n\n \ncases--without, as far as counsel are aware, a serious security violation by the \ndefense.  In one case, for example, the CIPA procedures successfully protected \nnuclear weapon codes that government scientists testified under oath were capable \nof  \"changing  the  strategic  global  balance\"  and  thus  \"represent[ed]  the  gravest \npossible security risk to the United States.\"  United States v. Lee, 2000 U.S. App. \nLEXIS 3082, at *5-*6 (10th Cir. Feb. 29, 2000).  If the CIPA procedures could \nadequately protect those secrets (and other sensitive classified information in many \nother cases), they can surely protect the secrets contained in the FISA materials at \nissue here.  In short, CIPA provides precisely the \"appropriate security procedures \nand protective orders\" that Congress contemplated would accompany disclosure \nwhen it enacted FISA.  50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(f), 1825(g).  \nE.  Disclosure Is Also Required Under Brady. \nBrady requires production of material evidence that would be favorable to \nthe defendant on a motion to suppress.  See United States v. Gamez-Orduno, 235 \nF.3d 453, 461 (9th Cir. 2000) (\"The suppression of material evidence helpful to the \naccused, whether at trial or on a motion to suppress, violates due process if there is \na reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed, the result of the \nproceeding would have been different.\") (emphasis added).  For the reasons we \nhave  outlined,  the  government's  application  to  the  FISC  and  the  FISC  order \nauthorizing  the  search  of  Gartenlaub's  home  and  computers  are  helpful  to  the \n  5 5   \n\n \ndefense in preparing the motion to suppress the FISA-derived evidence.  Brady \nthus requires their disclosure. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should reverse Gartenlaub's conviction.    \nSTATEMENT CONCERNING ORAL ARGUMENT \nAppellant requests oral argument.  Argument will permit counsel to address \nthe complex legal and factual questions that this case presents. \n \nDATED:  Feb. 8, 2017  Respectfully submitted, \n               /s/  John D.

With roughly 36,000 active \ndonors, EFF represents the interests of technology users in court cases and broader \npolicy debates surrounding the application of law in the digital age. EFF regularly \nparticipates as counsel or amicus in cases addressing the Fourth Amendment and \nelectronic surveillance, including foreign intelligence surveillance. See, e.g., Jewel \nv. NSA, 673 F.3d 902 (9th Cir. 2011). \nThe American Civil Liberties Union (“ACLU”) is a nationwide, nonprofit, \nnonpartisan organization with more than one million members dedicated to the \nprinciples of liberty and equality embodied in the Constitution and this nation’s \nlaws. The ACLU has appeared before the federal courts in many cases involving \nthe  Fourth  Amendment,  including  cases  concerning  foreign  intelligence \nsurveillance.  The  ACLU  represented  the  plaintiffs  in  Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l \nUSA, 133 S. Ct. 1138 (2013), and is currently counsel in Wikimedia v. NSA, 15-\n2560 (4th Cir.), and United States v. Muhtorov, No. 12-cr-00033 (D. Colo.).   \n1\t\r   \n\nINTRODUCTION \nThe unusual nature of this prosecution requires little elaboration. A citizen’s \nhome and his electronic devices—containing decades’ worth of personal \ninformation—were secretly searched by federal agents. Yet neither he nor his \nattorneys have ever seen the authorization for that search. And despite the \ngovernment’s invocation of national security to withhold this information, no \nnational security-related prosecution was ever initiated. Rather, the government \nrelied on its wide-ranging digital searches to initiate a prosecution for offenses \nrelated to child pornography. \nThe digital searches in this case raise unique and profound Fourth \nAmendment problems. As an initial matter, where the government seeks foreign \nintelligence information pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \n(“FISA”), 50 U.S.C. § 1801, et seq., its searches are premised on relaxed \nconstitutional standards, and they sweep more broadly than searches for evidence \nof criminal activity. Compounding the problem, the FISA-authorized searches in \nthis case involved forensic searches of electronic devices—which pose their own \nunique Fourth Amendment concerns, as this Court has already recognized. This \nconfluence of factors requires heightened vigilance to ensure that the government’s \nsearches comport with the Constitution. Thus, to satisfy the Fourth Amendment, \nthis Court should prohibit the use of non-foreign intelligence information in \n2\t\r   \n\ncriminal investigations and prosecutions when that information is obtained from \nFISA-authorized, forensic searches of electronic devices, as is the case here.  \nIn addition, given the unusual nature of this prosecution, and the likelihood \nthat the government improperly converted its foreign intelligence search into one \nfor unrelated criminal activity, it is critical that defendant’s counsel have access to \nrelevant FISA materials. Disclosure of this information to the defense will ensure \nthat a meaningful and informed Fourth Amendment challenge may be brought.  \nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \nIn January 2014, the FBI performed a secret search of Gartenlaub’s home \nand computers. E.R. 248. The search was authorized by the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court (“FISC”), a court with jurisdiction to authorize covert searches \nof locations within the United States to obtain foreign intelligence information. 50 \nU.S.C. §§ 1823, 1824. As part of its search, the FBI made wholesale copies of \nmultiple hard drives and digital devices—devices that contained decades’ worth of \ninformation and hundreds of thousands of files. E.R. 198, 248-49.    \nThe FBI retained and later searched its copies of those devices. The search \nof three of the hard drives revealed images of child pornography stored on the \ndrives. In August 2014, eight months after its initial search, the FBI obtained a \nsecond search warrant, this time from a magistrate judge in the Central District of \nCalifornia, to search for additional child pornography-related evidence in \n3\t\r   \n\nGartenlaub’s house, car, and storage units. E.R. 243.  \nGartenlaub was indicted for receipt and possession of child pornography. \nE.R. 296. Through pretrial motions, he moved for disclosure of the government’s \napplication to the FISC and the FISC’s order authorizing the search of his home \nand computers—information necessary to an informed Fourth Amendment \nchallenge to the FISA searches. The district court denied that motion, adopting \nverbatim an 11-page proposed order submitted by the government. E.R. 21.    \nARGUMENT  \nI.  FISA-AUTHORIZED SEARCHES OF ELECTRONIC DEVICES \nPRESENT UNIQUE FOURTH AMENDMENT PROBLEMS. \nTwo types of searches are implicated by this case: FISA-authorized searches \nand electronic searches of digital devices. Both raise unique and profound Fourth \nAmendment problems.   \n“Indiscriminate searches and seizures conducted under the authority of \n‘general warrants’ were the immediate evils that motivated the framing and \nadoption of the Fourth Amendment.” Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 583 \n(1980). To guard against those prohibited invasions, the Fourth Amendment \nrequires searches of private spaces to satisfy three familiar requirements: they must \nbe authorized by warrants, based “upon probable cause, supported by Oath or \naffirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or \n4\t\r   \n\nthings to be seized.” U.S. Const. amend. IV. The probable cause requirement \nensures that “fruits, instrumentalities, or evidence of a crime will be found” in the \nplace to be searched. Zurcher v. Stanford Daily, 436 U.S. 547, 554 (1978); see also \nIllinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238 (1983). The particularity requirement ensures \nthat “the search will be carefully tailored to its justifications” and does not “take on \nthe character of the wide-ranging exploratory searches the Framers intended to \nprohibit.” Maryland v. Garrison, 480 U.S. 79, 84 (1987). Taken together, these \nrequirements ensure that warrants, and the searches conducted pursuant to them, \nare not “so bountiful and expansive . . . that they constitute a virtual, all-\nencompassing dragnet.” United States v. Bridges, 344 F.3d 1010, 1016 (9th Cir. \n2003).  \nA.  FISA authorizes broad searches, based on relaxed Fourth \nAmendment standards, where the government seeks foreign \nintelligence information.  \nSearches conducted for foreign intelligence purposes, pursuant to FISA, \nmodify and relax these established constitutional imperatives. See In re Sealed \nCase, 310 F.3d 717, 741 (FISCR 2002) (acknowledging that “a FISA order may \nnot be a ‘warrant’ contemplated by the Fourth Amendment”).  \nFirst, FISA-authorized searches are based on an altered probable-cause \nstandard. Generally, probable cause to search exists when there is a fair probability \nthat a search will result in evidence of a crime being discovered. Gates, 462 U.S. at \n5\t\r   \n\n238. In the context of FISA searches, however, the government need not show that \nany evidence will be discovered, or even that a crime has been committed. In re \nSealed Case, 310 F.3d at 738 (“Congress clearly intended a lesser showing of \nprobable cause for these activities than that applicable to ordinary criminal \ncases.”). Rather, FISA search authorizations “shall” issue if a judge finds there is \nprobable cause to believe “the target of the physical search is a foreign power or an \nagent of a foreign power,” and that “the premises or property to be searched” is \nowned, used, possessed or in transit to an “agent of a foreign power or a foreign \npower.” 50 U.S.C. § 1824(a)(2)(A), (B). Neither of these showings requires \nevidence of criminal activity.1  \nSecond, FISA search authorizations are not particularized in the same way \nthat traditional search warrants must be. As the Fourth Amendment commands, \nwarrants must particularly describe the place to be searched and the persons or \nthings to be seized. U.S. Const. amend. IV. In a typical case, the object of a search \nmay be “to recover specific stolen or contraband goods” or to seize evidence of a \ncrime. Camara v. Mun. Court of City & Cty. of San Francisco, 387 U.S. 523, 535 \n(1967). In contrast, the object of a FISA-authorized search, “foreign intelligence \ninformation,” is exceedingly broad. Under FISA, “foreign intelligence \n\t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \n1 FISA’s definitions of “foreign power” and “agent of a foreign power” \nencompass some criminal activity, but the definitions do not require it. See 50 \nU.S.C. § 1801(a), (b). \n6\t\r   \n\ninformation” includes:  \ninformation that relates to, and if concerning a United States person is \nnecessary to, the ability of the United States to protect against . . . \nactual or potential attack or other grave hostile acts of a foreign power \nor an agent of a foreign power; . . . sabotage, international terrorism, \nor the international proliferation of weapons of mass destruction by a \nforeign power or an agent of a foreign power; or . . . clandestine \nintelligence activities by an intelligence service or network of a \nforeign power or by an agent of a foreign power; or . . . information \nwith respect to a foreign power or foreign territory that relates to, and \nif concerning a United States person is necessary to . . . the national \ndefense or the security of the United States; or . . . the conduct of the \nforeign affairs of the United States. \n \n50 U.S.C. § 1801(e). Thus, under FISA, although the government must identify the \nplace it intends to search and the types of materials it intends to seize, see 50 \nU.S.C. § 1824(c)(1)(A) - (C), the object of its search is “foreign intelligence \ninformation”—an unspecific and elastic category of information that encompasses \n“the foreign affairs of the United States” and the “national defense or the security \nof the United States,” among other broad categories. 50 U.S.C. § 1801(e)(2)(A), \n(B). \nUnsurprisingly, in practice, FISA’s relaxed requirements result in broad and \nintrusive searches. As the FISC itself has observed, FISA countenances far more \nsweeping searches of places and property than a typical warrant. See In re All \nMatters Submitted to the FISC, 218 F. Supp. 2d. 611, 617 (FISC 2002) (describing \nthe “breadth” accorded the FBI in FISA searches of a target’s “residence, office, \nvehicles, computer, safe deposit box and U.S. mails”), rev’d on other grounds, In \n7\t\r   \n\nre Sealed Case, 310 F.3d 717. Indeed, because of the foreign intelligence needs \nthat FISA searches serve, courts allow these searches to be more permissive along \nalmost every axis—from their initial authorization, to their execution, to the \ngovernment’s retention and analysis of seized material. See id. (cataloging the \n“practices and provisions” of FISA that render such searches exceptionally broad \nand intrusive).  \nFinally, one element of FISA renders these invasive searches especially \nsusceptible to misuse: under the statute, obtaining “foreign intelligence \ninformation” need not be the only, or even the primary, purpose of a FISA search. \nInstead, since 2001, the statute has required only that a “significant purpose” of a \nsearch be “to obtain foreign intelligence information.” 50 U.S.C. § 1823(a)(6)(B); \nsee In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d at 736-746 (upholding “significant purpose” test \nwhile warning that “the FISA process cannot be used as a device to investigate \nwholly unrelated ordinary crimes”); see also Mayfield v. United States, 504 F. \nSupp. 2d 1023, 1042-43 (D. Or. 2007) (finding “significant purpose” standard \nviolated Fourth Amendment), vacated, 588 F.3d 1252 (9th Cir. 2009). To be sure, \nthere may be cases where the foreign intelligence information sought by a FISA \nsearch would also constitute evidence of criminal activity, and therefore is in \nservice of a specific and overlapping criminal investigation. But this flexibility \npresents a considerable risk that investigators will use FISA—and the broad \n8\t\r   \n\nsearches it permits—as an end-run around the more restrictive Fourth Amendment \nrules governing criminal investigations. Cf. United States v. Truong Dinh Hung, \n629 F.2d 908, 915 (4th Cir. 1980) (rejecting the government’s view that “if \nsurveillance is to any degree directed at gathering foreign intelligence, the \nexecutive may ignore the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment”).2 \nIn sum, FISA searches are, at best, countenanced on constitutionally \nexpansive showings of probable cause and particularity, predicated on the theory \nthat those searches are carried out to obtain foreign intelligence information, \nbroadly defined.  \nB.  Because of their breadth, FISA searches of personal electronic \ndevices raise unique Fourth Amendment problems. \nBecause FISA searches are broader and predicated on a lower standard than \ntraditional search warrants, they raise serious constitutional concerns. The problem \nis compounded when those searches involve electronic devices containing vast \namounts of private information.  \n\t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \n2 The Congress that enacted FISA was well aware of these risks. “Congress \nwas concerned about the government’s use of FISA surveillance to obtain \ninformation not truly intertwined with the government’s efforts to protect against \nthreats from foreign powers.” In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d at 725. The “significant \npurpose” amendment did not reflect a retreat from this concern, nor did it grant the \ngovernment permission to use FISA to pursue unrelated criminal investigations. \nSee id. at 736 (“[W]e see not the slightest indication that Congress meant to give \nthat power to the Executive Branch.”). \n9\t\r   \n\n1.  The Fourth Amendment protects information held in private \nplaces, like computers and hard drives. \nThe Fourth Amendment expressly protects a person’s right to be “secure” in \ntheir “papers” and “effects” from government intrusion. U.S. Const. amend. IV. It \n“embod[ies] a particular concern for government trespass upon the areas (‘persons, \nhouses, papers, and effects’) it enumerates.” United States v. Jones, 565 U.S. 400, \n406 (2012).  \nThe Fourth Amendment extends to information stored digitally as well as in \ntangible papers and effects. “The papers we create and maintain not only in \nphysical but also in digital form reflect our most private thoughts and activities.” \nUnited States v. Cotterman, 709 F.3d 952, 957 (9th Cir. 2013) (en banc). Indeed, \nbecause of their immense storage capacity and increasing importance in daily \ntasks, computers, cell phones and other digital devices hold “a digital record of \nnearly every aspect of [users’] lives—from the mundane to the intimate.” Riley v. \nCalifornia, 134 S. Ct. 2473, 2490 (2014).    \nBecause of the wealth of private information digital devices contain, the \nSupreme Court and this Court have emphasized that searches of personal electronic \ndevices are different than searches in the physical world, requiring special attention \nto constitutional limitations. See In re Grand Jury Subpoena, JK-15-029, 828 F.3d \n1083, 1090 (9th Cir. 2016).  \nThis is true for several reasons. First, as the Supreme Court held in Riley, \n1\t\r  0 \n\ndigital searches are not analogous to those of physical containers because digital \ndevices have “immense storage capacity,” so the “intrusion on privacy is not \nphysically limited in the same way when it comes to [digital devices].” Riley, 134 \nS. Ct. at 2489. Second, these devices have an “element of pervasiveness” in daily \nlife; nearly everyone uses cell phones and computers on a regular basis for a wide \nvariety of purposes, and a single device will routinely contain many different types \nof data unlikely to be stored in one place in the physical world. Id. at 2490. \n“Searches of computers therefore often involve a degree of intrusiveness much \ngreater in quantity, if not different in kind, from searches of other containers.” \nUnited States v. Payton, 573 F.3d 859, 862 (9th Cir. 2009). The “uniquely sensitive \nnature of data on electronic devices” thus renders “an exhaustive exploratory \nsearch more intrusive than with other forms of property.” Cotterman, 709 F.3d at \n966. \n2.  This Court and others have imposed limitations on the searches \nof digital devices to ensure those searches do not violate the \nFourth Amendment. \nThis Court has recognized the potential for abuse—and the concomitant \nneed for limitations—in searches of vast repositories of electronically stored \nprivate information.  \nTraditionally, courts have viewed the solution to circumscribing intrusive \nsearches as “simple”: requiring the government to “get a warrant.” Riley, 134 S. Ct. \n1\t\r  1 \n\nat 2495. However, as early as 1982, this Court recognized that electronic storage \nmight result in intermingling of items described in a warrant and other material that \nthe government had no probable cause to seize. United States v. Tamura, 694 F.2d \n591, 595-96 (9th Cir. 1982).  \nIn Tamura, the government obtained a warrant to seize evidence of \npayments received by the defendant from records held by his employer. Id. at 594. \nIn order to find this evidence, however, agents needed to peruse a lengthy printout \nof records, identify specific transactions, and obtain corresponding vouchers. \nRather than doing so onsite, the government seized the entire set of records and \nsorted through them later. Id. at 595.  \nThe Court held that this violated the Fourth Amendment. Id. It noted that \n“all items in a set of files may be inspected during a search, provided that \nsufficiently specific guidelines for identifying the documents sought are provided \nin the search warrant and are followed by the officers conducting the search.” Id. \nBut “the wholesale seizure for later detailed examination of records not described \nin a warrant is significantly more intrusive, and has been characterized as ‘the kind \nof investigatory dragnet that the fourth amendment was designed to prevent.’” Id. \n(quoting United States v. Abrams, 615 F.2d 541, 543 (1st Cir. 1980)). To protect \nagainst “overseizure,” the Court outlined a protocol that would allow for offsite \nsorting and segregation of material not covered by the warrant. Id. at 596 & n.3.  \n1\t\r  2 \n\nIn the last 35 years, the problem of overseizure has gone from the \n“comparatively rare instance[]” described in Tamura, 694 F.2d at 595, to “an \ninherent part of the electronic search process.” United States v. Comprehensive \nDrug Testing, Inc. (“CDT”), 621 F.3d 1162, 1177 (9th Cir. 2010) (en banc). \nIndeed, “almost every hard drive encountered by law enforcement will contain \nrecords that have nothing to do with the investigation.” Department of Justice, \nSearching and Seizing Computers and Obtaining Evidence in Criminal \nInvestigations 87 (2009).3 As a result, the government routinely applies for and \nreceives “two-stage search” warrants: first to physically seize a digital storage \ndevice and make a complete digital copy or “image” of its contents, and then to \nanalyze the copy using forensic software. Id. at 76, 86-87.  \nEven if overseizure is often necessary when conducting searches of digital \ndevices, it cannot be exploited to evade the Fourth Amendment’s restrictions. No \nmatter how investigators conduct a search, they must “avoid turning a limited \nsearch for particular information into a general search of office file systems and \ncomputer databases.” CDT, 621 F.3d at 1170; see also United States v. Galpin, 720 \nF.3d 436, 447 (2d Cir. 2013) (risk of digital searches becoming too general \n“demands a heightened sensitivity to the particularity requirement in the context of \ndigital searches”).  \n\t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \n3 Available at https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/criminal-\nccips/legacy/2015/01/14/ssmanual2009.pdf.   \n1\t\r  3 \n\nThis Court’s opinion in CDT is an instructive example of why digital \nsearches demand heightened sensitivity to the Fourth Amendment’s requirements. \nIn that case, government investigators obtained a warrant for drug-testing records \nof ten Major League Baseball players. 621 F.3d at 1166-67. However, they seized \nelectronic storage devices and copied a directory containing information about \nhundreds of players, in addition to the ten mentioned in the warrant, and searched \nall of the files in the directory, despite conditions in the warrant that precluded \nthem from doing so. Id. at 1167-68. Nevertheless, the government argued it had \ncomplied with the conditions in the warrant and this Court’s guidance in Tamura \nbecause Tamura permitted overseizure in certain circumstances. Id. at 1170. The \ngovernment therefore contended that the information it possessed about players \noutside the search warrant was nonetheless “lawfully seized” and in “plain view,” \nallowing it to be further retained, searched, and used in criminal investigations and \nprosecutions. Id.   \nThe CDT Court forcefully rejected this argument because it “would make a \nmockery of Tamura.” Id. at 1171. The Court called for “greater vigilance on the \npart of judicial officers” and reiterated that “the process of segregating electronic \ndata that is seizable from that which is not must not become a vehicle for the \ngovernment to gain access to data which it has no probable cause to collect.” Id. at \n1177. In a concurring opinion joined by four other judges, Judge Kozinski offered \n1\t\r  4 \n\nmore specific guidance for how authorizing magistrates could impose ex ante \nsearch conditions to ensure digital searches remain tailored to evidence for which \nthe government has probable cause. Id. at 1178 (Kozinski, J., concurring). These \nconditions include foreswearing reliance on the plain view doctrine,4 the use of an \nindependent taint team, and use of a search protocol “designed to uncover only the \ninformation for which [the government] has probable cause.” Id. at 1180. \nTo avoid particularity problems, search warrants for electronic devices \nshould, at the very least, establish at the outset appropriate safeguards—such as the \nuse of taint teams—to ensure that government investigators access only the items \nfor which there is probable cause. See Groh v. Ramirez, 540 U.S. 551, 561 (2004).  \nIn addition, courts reviewing searches of electronic devices after the fact \nmust scrutinize the “reasonableness of the officer’s acts both in executing the \nwarrant and in performing a subsequent search of seized materials.” United States \nv. Hill, 459 F.3d 966, 978 (9th Cir. 2006). In particular, courts should be skeptical \nof evidence outside the scope of a warrant that the government claims was in plain \nview and was therefore lawfully obtained. CDT, 621 F.3d at 1171. \n\t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \n4 The plain view doctrine allows an officer who is lawfully present in a place \nto seize an item if its illegal nature is “immediately apparent.” Horton v. \nCalifornia, 496 U.S. 128, 136-37 (1990); United States v. Lemus, 582 F.3d 958, \n964 (9th Cir. 2009). It is not clear how the plain view doctrine should apply in the \ncontext of digital searches, if at all. See CDT, 621 F.3d at 1171.  \n1\t\r  5 \n\nII.  TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE FOURTH AMENDMENT, \nTHE COURT SHOULD IMPOSE STRICT LIMITATIONS ON THE \nUSE OF INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM FISA-AUTHORIZED, \nFORENSIC SEARCHES OF ELECTRONIC DEVICES. \nFISA searches of electronic devices pose an unusually acute risk of \nbecoming general searches for evidence of criminal activity. Thus, to satisfy the \nFourth Amendment, this Court should impose strict limitations on the use of \ninformation obtained through these searches.  \nSpecifically, the Court should prohibit the government from using non-\nforeign intelligence information in criminal investigations and prosecutions when \nthat information is obtained during a FISA-authorized, forensic search of an \nelectronic device. See CDT, 621 at 1178 (noting such restrictions will ensure \n“future searches of electronic records” do not turn “all warrants for digital data into \ngeneral warrants”) (Kozinski, J., concurring). In this case, such a prohibition would \nrequire the exclusion of the evidence of child pornography used to convict \nGartenlaub.  \nThis Court has already called for “vigilance” in “striking the right balance \nbetween the government’s interest in law enforcement and the right of individuals \nto be free from unreasonable searches and seizures” when searching electronic \ndevices. CDT, 621 at 1177. The extraordinary facts of this case require precisely \nthat kind of vigilance. The Court should not allow foreign intelligence searches, \nwith all of their attendant breadth and secrecy, to become a backdoor to the \n1\t\r  6 \n\nexploratory rummaging that is plainly forbidden under the Fourth Amendment.  \nTwo rationales independently support such a use restriction. First, as this \nCourt has recognized, reliance on plain view in electronic searches forms a \nhazardous constitutional basis for obtaining evidence. See CDT 621 F.3d at 1171; \nsee also id. at 1180 (Kozinski, J., concurring) (recommending that digital search \nwarrants require foreswearing reliance on plain view). It is inconsistent with CDT \nand Tamura to argue that “plain view” can apply to files outside the scope of the \nwarrant. A use restriction on non-foreign intelligence information obtained in a \nFISA search ensures fidelity to the Fourth Amendment limits set out in those cases. \nAlternatively, even if an initial seizure of information is itself “reasonable”—the \nultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment—subsequent uses of lawfully seized \ninformation can still violate the Fourth Amendment. See United States v. Jacobsen, \n466 U.S. 109, 124-125 (1984); United States v. Sedaghaty, 728 F.3d 885, 914 (9th \nCir. 2013) (invalidating computer search where agents sought to retain and use \n“information beyond the scope of the warrant” and insisting that agents “should \nhave sought a further warrant”); cf. Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 19 (1968) (“The \nscope of the search must be ‘strictly tied to and justified by’ the circumstances \nwhich rendered its initiation permissible.”) (quoting Warden v. Hayden, 387 U.S. \n294, 310 (1967) (Fortas, J., concurring)).  Thus, while the seizure of Gartenlaub’s \ndevices may have been permissible at the outset, the later use of information \n1\t\r  7 \n\noutside the scope of the FISA authorization was not. See Jacobsen, 466 U.S. at \n125; see also Orin S. Kerr, Executing Warrants for Digital Evidence: The Case for \nUse Restrictions on Nonresponsive Data, 48 Texas Tech L. Rev. 1, 27-29 (2015).  \nUnder either rationale, as this Court recognized in CDT, “[e]veryone’s \ninterests are best served if there are clear rules to follow that strike a fair balance” \nbetween the needs of the government in conducting searches and “the rights of \nindividuals . . . to the privacy that is at the heart of the Fourth Amendment.” 621 \nF.3d at 1177. The prohibition on the use of non-foreign intelligence information \nobtained through a search of an electronic device is precisely this type of necessary \n“clear rule.” See Kerr, Executing Warrants for Digital Evidence at 18 (“The best \nway to minimize the unwarranted intrusions upon privacy for computer searches is \nto impose use restrictions on the nonresponsive data revealed in the course of the \nsearch.”).  \nAlthough the government has not explained how it found the child \npornography on the imaged devices, it seems highly likely that investigators \nemployed techniques or software that went beyond the foreign intelligence purpose \nof the initial FISA search. Forensic software allows investigators to sift through \neven very large numbers of files in ways that would be impossible unaided by a \ncomputer. For example, common software can scan a computer’s contents for child \npornography by generating an “overview” of all photos on a computer and \n1\t\r  8 \n\nautomatically flagging images based on “a library of known files previously \nsubmitted by law enforcement—most of which are images of child pornography.” \nUnited States v. Mann, 592 F.3d 779, 781 (7th Cir. 2010). Investigators may have \nalso employed other forensic techniques to search for child pornography. For \ninstance, in United States v. Johnston, 789 F.3d 934, 941-42 (9th Cir. 2015), \nofficers executing a search warrant for child pornography conducted several \ndifferent forensic searches: a “forensic preview” that copied the entire contents of \nthe defendant’s computer and flagged child pornography “within five to ten \nminutes,” a subsequent scan that resulted in a gallery of all image and video files \non the computer, and, years later, an exhaustive scan of email, chat logs, and \n“unallocated space” on the computer.5 \nCrucially, if the government “abandoned” its foreign intelligence search and \naffirmatively searched for evidence of unrelated crimes, the search violated the \nFourth Amendment. Johnston, 789 F.3d at 942; United States v. Carey, 172 F.3d \n1268, 1273 (10th Cir. 1999); United States v. Sarkissian, 841 F.2d 959, 965 (9th \nCir. 1988); see also In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d at 736 (“[T]he FISA process \ncannot be used as a device to investigate wholly unrelated ordinary crimes.”). \nWhile the exact course of the government’s investigation has never been disclosed, \n\t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \n5 “Unallocated space is space on a hard drive that contains deleted data, \nusually emptied from the operating system’s trash or recycle bin folder, that cannot \nbe seen or accessed by the user without the use of forensic software.” United States \nv. Flyer, 633 F.3d 911, 919 (9th Cir. 2011). \n1\t\r  9 \n\nthis could have occurred in a number of ways. Investigators may have used \nforensic software that automatically flagged files known or suspected to contain \nchild pornography near the start of their searches of Gartenlaub’s hard drives. Or \ninvestigators may have decided to apply those tools only once they grew frustrated \nat their inability to find evidence of espionage, in the hope of leveraging any \nevidence of unrelated criminal activity into an espionage confession. In either case, \nthe government’s FISA searches were necessarily restricted to “foreign intelligence \ninformation,” so it is difficult to see how an automated scan for child pornography \nwould serve an authorized purpose.  \nIf the government relied on child pornography-detecting software, similar to \nthat used in Johnston, 789 F.3d at 941-42, it plainly exceeded the scope of the \nFISA authorization. But even if the files were identified manually, the search may \nhave been unlawful. For instance, investigators may have opened individual image \nor video files located in directories or with file names that had no apparent \nconnection to their foreign intelligence search. See Carey, 172 F.3d at 1273 (agent \nexecuting warrant for information about drug trafficking violated Fourth \nAmendment by opening files expecting to find child pornography). Or agents may \nhave encountered images that they suspected contained child pornography, and \nthen applied the FBI’s own forensic tools to analyze the images or shared them \nwith the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children for analytic \n2\t\r  0 \n\npurposes—without first obtaining a criminal warrant. United States v. Sedaghaty, \n728 F.3d at 914 (government must obtain a “further warrant” in conducting \ncomputer search when it seeks information beyond the scope of its original \nwarrant); see also Sarkissian, 841 F.2d at 965 (“At no point was this case an \nordinary criminal investigation.”). Each of these examples represents a way the \ngovernment’s search of Gartenlaub’s devices may have transgressed Fourth \nAmendment limitations.6  \nThe fact that FISA’s minimization procedures anticipate the retention and \ndissemination of “evidence of a crime” in no way alters this analysis. See 50 \nU.S.C. § 1821(4)(C). Unsurprisingly, Congress’s primary impetus for allowing this \nuse was to facilitate the prosecution of crimes related to foreign intelligence and \nnational security. See In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d at 724-25 (citing H.R. Rep. No. \n95-1283 at 49 (1978)). But even if Congress also contemplated the retention and \ndissemination of evidence of crimes wholly unrelated to national security, it could \nnot have anticipated the types of searches and seizures at issue here. Congress \nadopted this rule long before personal electronic devices, storing vast amounts of \nprivate information, became widespread. Indeed, when Congress expanded FISA \nto include physical searches in 1994, it largely imported the minimization \n\t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \n6 At a minimum, it is clear that the manner in which the electronic searches \nwere conducted matters immensely, yet none of that information has been provided \nto the defense. See Section III; Appellant’s Brief 36. \n2\t\r  1 \n\nrequirements applicable to FISA electronic surveillance, which dated to 1978. \nCompare 50 U.S.C. § 1801(h), with 50 U.S.C. § 1821(4).  \nWithout discounting the intrusiveness of traditional wiretaps or physical \nsearches (intrusions that are, without question, substantial), a search of all the \ninformation stored on an individual’s electronic device represents “a degree of \nintrusiveness much greater in quantity, if not different in kind.” Payton, 573 F.3d \nat 862. As Riley teaches, searches of electronic devices may be even more intrusive \nthan a physical search of a person’s home: an electronic device “not only contains \nin digital form many sensitive records previously found in the home; it also \ncontains a broad array of private information never found in a home in any form.” \n134 S. Ct. at 2491; see also id. at 2489 (describing types of sensitive data found on \nelectronic devices). Such was the case here: the government obtained, reviewed, \nand ultimately used information stored on Gartenlaub’s devices that spanned \nnearly two decades. See E.R. 256 (describing letters allegedly written in 1997). \nHowever reasonable Section 1821(4)(C) may be as a general matter, the provision \nbecomes unreasonable when interpreted to authorize a search through two decades \nof an individual’s digital life—and the subsequent use of that information in a \ncriminal prosecution. See Jacobsen, 466 U.S. at 125. \nThe government has argued that it must be able to search broadly for \nconcealed foreign intelligence information. That may well be true, but it cannot be \n2\t\r  2 \n\nthat the government thereby obtains a general warrant to search personal electronic \ndevices—with all the private information they contain—and can use the fruits of \nthose general searches in wholly unrelated criminal prosecutions. CDT, 621 F.3d at \n1176-77. To allow that would only amplify the constitutional problems presented \nby both FISA searches and digital searches in the first instance.   \nIII.  THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED BY REFUSING TO DISCLOSE \nTHE FISA MATERIALS TO DEFENDANT’S COUNSEL.  \nAs described above, this case presents serious questions concerning the \nconstitutionality and scope of FISA-authorized searches of electronic devices. \nAmici believe that even on the limited public record in this case, this Court should \nhold that the searches of Gartenlaub’s hard drives exceeded the government’s \nauthority. But even if the Court does not now hold that the FISA search violated \nthe Fourth Amendment, it cannot overlook that it was difficult—if not \nimpossible—for Gartenlaub to meaningfully challenge the lawfulness of those \nsearches and seizures, because the district court denied his counsel the opportunity \nto review the underlying FISA materials and other critical information about how \nthose searches were actually carried out. The Court should therefore hold, at \nminimum, that disclosure was necessary to the resolution of Gartenlaub’s motions \nand remand to the district court. See 50 U.S.C. § 1825(g). \nThe confluence of factors in this case—of constitutionally relaxed FISA-\nauthorized searches; the constitutionally suspect search of electronic devices; and \n2\t\r  3 \n\nthe unusual nature of this investigation and prosecution—all counsel in favor of the \nneed for disclosure of the FISA materials to the defense.  \nGartenlaub seeks access to the FISA application and the FISC order that \nresulted in the search of his house and the seizure of his electronic devices in \nJanuary 2014. Opening Br. at 36. For the reasons described above, he should also \nbe entitled to any materials describing the protocols imposed by the FISC on the \nsearch of his electronic devices, including the government’s statutorily required \nminimization procedures. See 50 U.S.C. § 1821(4)(A) (requiring protocols “to \nminimize the acquisition and retention, and prohibit the dissemination, of \nnonpublicly available information concerning unconsenting United States \npersons”). In addition, Gartenlaub’s security-cleared counsel should have the \nopportunity to review information about how the FISA search was actually carried \nout, since this is crucial to assessing the constitutionality of the government’s \ndiscovery and use of the evidence against him in this prosecution. See Hill, 459 \nF.3d at 978. \nThe district court’s construction of 50 U.S.C. § 1825(g) conflicts with \nGartenlaub’s constitutional right to seek suppression of illegally obtained evidence, \nand this Court should construe Section 1825(g) to require disclosure of FISA \nmaterials in at least those cases where, as here, the physical search raises unusually \n2\t\r  4 \n\ncomplex questions of fact and law.7 \nFinally, because due process requires a careful weighing of competing \ninterests in disclosure, this Court should scrutinize the government’s claims of \nprivilege closely. Information in the public record undermines the government’s \nrepeated, categorical claim that it must withhold all FISA materials from defense \ncounsel. Indeed, it has made identical claims—that any disclosure would threaten \nnational security—in every FISA case for the past 35 years. Those general claims \nof harm are overbroad, given that the government has often disclosed similar \ninformation publicly. For example, in this case, the government apparently refused \nto disclose the relevant FBI minimization procedures to Gartenlaub’s counsel even \nthough other versions of those minimization procedures are publicly available. See \nStandard Minimization Procedures for FBI Electronic Surveillance and Physical \n\t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \n7 Both the Fourth and Fifth Amendments require that defendants be afforded \na meaningful opportunity to seek suppression of evidence that was obtained \nillegally. Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon, 548 U.S. 331, 348 (2006); Franks v. \nDelaware, 438 U.S. 154, 155-56 (1978) (hearing on veracity of warrant required \nwhere defendant makes “substantial preliminary showing” that affidavit contains \nfalse statements or omissions); see also United States v. Phillips, 540 F.2d 319, \n325–26 (8th Cir. 1976) (due process requires means for defendant to seek \nsuppression remedy). Part of that process, as this Court has held, requires that the \ngovernment disclose information to a defendant that could affect the outcome of a \nsuppression hearing. See, e.g., United States v. Gamez-Orduno, 235 F.3d 453, 461 \n(9th Cir. 2000).  \n \n2\t\r  5 \n\nSearch Conducted Under FISA (2008).8 In other instances, the government has \nwithheld critical information concerning FISA surveillance for years only to \ninexplicably reverse course when pressed by the courts. See, e.g., Gov’t Ex Parte \nNotice in Response to the Court’s Ex Parte Order, United States v. Mohamud, No. \n14-30217 (9th Cir. Sept. 2, 2016) (ECF 109-2) (explaining that, following court-\nordered declassification review, certain FISA information could be released after \nall). These releases make clear that the Court should not take at face value the \ngovernment’s all-encompassing claim that any disclosure to defense counsel, even \nunder an appropriate protective order, would cause harm.  \nUnder these circumstances, disclosure of FISA materials under appropriate \nsecurity measures is “necessary” for “an accurate determination of the legality of \nthe physical search.” 50 U.S.C. § 1825(g). It is also necessary as a matter of \nconstitutional right.  \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons explained above, the Court should prohibit the use of non-\nforeign intelligence information in criminal investigations and prosecutions when \n\t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \n8 Available at https://www.aclu.org/files/pdfs/natsec/faafoia \n20101129/FAAFBI0707.pdf (obtained via Freedom of Information Act).

But this is not a national security \n5  case, and Petitioner Keith Preston Gartenlaub has never been charged with a \n6  national security crime. Nor has the government produced any evidence to date, \n7  implicating Mr. Gartenlaub in any national security crime. But after what the \n8  government admitted on appeal was a general rummaging through Petitioner's \n9  computers, home, and life under the FISA Warrant, Petitioner was convicted for \n10  receipt and possession of child pornography. The District Court would afterward \n11  strike the receipt charge as multiplicitous. At every step of this proceeding \n12  Petitioner Gartenlaub has been denied access to any information about the FISA \n13  search, often after the courts have met ex parte, in camera, and off the record, with \n14  the government. This happened at both the District Court level, and at the Ninth \n15  Circuit. \n16  The District Court, despite expressing misgivings about the FISA \n17  proceedings on the record, denied Gartenlaub's motion for a Franks hearing to \n18  challenge the probable cause behind the FISA search.1 Nor did the Jury ever learn \n19  of the gaps in the evidentiary record left by the secret FISA search and the serious \n20  questions it posed. The court had ruled squarely on the side of the government \n21  when it came to the integrity of the secret search and evidence. It is an almost \n22  impossible task to defend against something you cannot examine but are required \n23  to trust. Particularly when the charges are as explosive as child pornography. \n24 \n25 \n \n26  1 (District Ct Tr. at 9-10 (4/18/16).

In four of these \n7  cases the \"Woods File,\" the file with the factual documentation supporting \n8  the application, was missing entirely.2 This new evidence didn't emerge until \n9  March 30, 2020. That’s when the Inspector General released a memorandum \n10  (the \"IG Memo\") documenting errors, omissions, and procedural failures in \n11  all 29 FBI FISA applications it reviewed spanning back through October \n12  2014. As the New York Times reported upon its release, the IG Memo's \n13  \"finding of systemic incompetence is devastating for the FBI.\"3 Petitioner's \n14  FISA Application was granted by the FISC in January 2014, a mere seven \n15  months before the last case the Inspector General has reviewed to date. \n16  The IG Memo followed a December 2019, 400 page \"damning report\" \n17  (the \"IG Report\"),4 as the New York Times called it, of the serious errors \n18   \n2 Michael E.

Fundamental to this trust is that the \n8  government conduct its prosecutions with integrity, credibility, and \n9  reliability. And nowhere is this more important than when the government \n10  executes unreviewable top-secret national security searches. Our national \n11  security is supposed to protect our liberty, not take it away. \n12  Throughout this process, whether on pretrial release, supervised release \n13  before reporting for his sentence, serving his sentence, and to date, Petitioner Keith \n14  Gartenlaub has a clean record. Indeed, the only thing on his record is this \n15  conviction.6 He's never been accused of any inappropriate contact with children. \n16  The computer files in question here date back to 2005, and the evidence at trial is \n17  consistent with the files never having been opened.7 But despite his good behavior \n18  and having served his prison sentence without event, he now lives under the \n19  onerous conditions of a lifetime probation that severely circumscribes where he \n20  can live and work.8 The IG Memo and Report call into question the integrity of the \n21  government's case and raise disturbing and fundamental constitutional questions \n22  about the validity of the FBI's error laden FISA application practice and procedure. \n23 \n \n2019), available at https://oig.justice.gov/reports/2019/o20012.pdf (last accessed April 19, 2020) \n24 \n[hereinafter The 2019 IG Report].\n \n5 Id. \n25 \n6 (Decl. of K.

In the alternative, it should order a new trial and lift the \n3  onerous conditions of his lifetime probation. \n4  First, the \"systemic incompetence\" documented in the IG Memo listing \n5  errors and omissions in every FISA Application, reviewed so far, is new evidence, \n6  unavailable until this point. That evidence would have been material to the District \n7  and Appellate Courts’ review of this matter, as well as, material to the jury's \n8  determination of reasonable doubt. The lack of this evidence, which was \n9  impossible for the Defense to discover because the IG Memo and Report \n10  didn't come out until last month, prejudiced Gartenlaub. The IG Memo and \n11  Report directly questions the integrity and credibility of the government’s \n12  case, and raises far more than the likelihood of a different outcome if both \n13  judge and jury were aware of the systemic nature of the errors and omissions \n14  in the FISA application process. \n15  Second, the lack of this new evidence of systemic errors and \n16  omissions, combined with the District Court's denying the Defense any \n17  access to the FISA Application, and any related evidence, was a denial of \n18  Gartenlaub's constitutional right to put on a complete defense. Knowledge of \n19  the systemic, pervasive errors and omissions in the FBI's FISA application \n20  process would have led the defense to aggressively challenge the FISA \n21  Application, search, and lack of any forensic record from the government on \n22  this point. As affirmed in the attached declarations, the Defense would have \n23  put on its computer expert to challenge the procedural and evidentiary black \n24  hole that is the period of the FISA search in this case. And the Defense \n25  would have aggressively argued reasonable doubt based of the vagaries of \n26 \n27 \n4 \n   \nNOTICE OF MOTION AND MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN \n \nSUPPORT OF 28 U.S.C. § 2255 HABEAS CORPUS PETITION \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-03711-ODW   Document 1-1   Filed 04/22/20   Page 9 of 28   Page ID #:37\n \n1  the FISA search to the jury and the fact there is no way to prove evidence wasn't \n2  altered. \n3  For these reasons, and as detailed below, this Court should vacate \n4  Gartenlaub's conviction.

After reading a second article speculating that \"hackers\" may \n7  have compromised the Boeing C-17 program, Agent Harris launched an \n8  investigation.16 For reasons never revealed, the investigation targeted \n9  Petitioner Keith Preston Gartenlaub, a U.S. citizen, who at the time was an \n10  Engineering IT Manager at Boeing in Long Beach, California. No evidence \n11  exists, then or now, that Gartenlaub provided C-17 designs to China. He has \n12  never been charged with any national security crimes. \n13  In July 2016, Chinese Citizen Su Bin was sentenced for his role in \n14  plotting to steal the C-17 military cargo plane designs.17  \n15  Agent Harris's investigation latched onto two principal facts:  that \n16  Gartenlaub's position at Boeing allegedly gave him access to C-17 data; and, \n17 \n \n14 (ER 378.)

He also jointly owned property in China with his wife. \n4  Gartenlaub hid none of this. Petitioner's wife has never been charged with \n5  any espionage related crimes, nor has any evidence ever been produced \n6  linking her to espionage. \n7  Gartenlaub disclosed his Chinese travel to Boeing and received its \n8  approval. And Agent Harris knew this. He knew that Gartenlaub's \n9  communications with China had nothing to do with the C-17 and were \n10  explained by his family there. He knew that numerous employees could \n11  access Boeings C-17 data. Nonetheless, Agent Harris used Gartenlaub's \n12  alleged access, which Harris misunderstood and exaggerated, his Chinese-\n13  born wife, and other innocuous facts to get a FISA warrant. \n14  In his affidavit Agent Harris falsely stated that Gartenlaub was the only \n15  employee at Boeing with “the combination of access to the C-17 data, knowledge \n16  of the computer network and systems, suspicious behavior and concerns by \n17  security personnel who worked with him, and connections and travel to China.”18 \n18  A simple investigation into Gartenlaub’s career at Boeing reveals this isn't true. As \n19  the Washington Post reports, but apparently the FBI didn't check, Gartenlaub never \n20  had access to the Boeing C-17 data, and Boeing employees have expressed \n21  confusion as to why the FBI suspected Gartenlaub for stealing C-17 data he \n19\n22  couldn't access.  Further, Agent Harris falsely identified Gartenlaub’s position as \n23 \n \n24  18 (Harris Aff.)

FISA \n4  requires that there be probable cause that an American citizen targeted for a search \n21\n5  be an agent of a foreign power.  For the next three months the FBI secretly \n6  entered Petitioner's home, imaged his hard drives, searched whatever they wanted \n7  without limitation and wire tapped Petitioner. Despite their unfettered rummaging \n8  through every corner of Petitioner's life, they never have charged Petitioner \n9  with national security crimes or produced a shred of evidence implicating \n10  him in any. Instead, it took the fruits of its Top Secret FISA search and used \n11  it in a domestic criminal prosecution having nothing to do with national \n12  security. \n13  Agent Harris's investigation was one of many launched at a time of \n14  intense pressure on the FBI and DOJ to take action against Chinese \n15  espionage targeting U.S. military and trade secrets. This pressure led to \n16  questionable investigations and prosecutions that have led to accusations of \n17  racism against Chinese Americans like Petitioner's wife.

Most, if not all, of these prosecutions \n2  collapsed for reasons including false evidentiary assumptions and accusations of \n3  racism against Chinese Americans.22  \n4  In November 2015, these accusations of DOJ racism against Chinese \n5  Americans led the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights to send a letter to U.S. \n6  Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch. The letter was asking for an \n7  investigation into the targeting of \"Asian Americans for investigation, \n8  surveillance, and arrest, due to their race or national origin.\"23 Eventually, \n9  the DOJ's main office in Washington, D.C. addressed these accusations of \n10  racially motivated national security investigations. \n11  In 2016, the DOJ in Washington, D.C. issued new guidelines governing \n12  national security investigations under FISA. Judging by the IG Report and Memo, \n13  they are a failure. The guidelines require regional DOJ prosecutors to consult with \n14  national security prosecutors in Washington, D.C., before proceeding.24 \n15  But in 2013, these guidelines didn't exist. And, initially, Agent Harris didn't \n16  turn to FISA in his hunt for Chinese spies. In June 2013, Agent Harris applied, \n17  under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41 (\"Rule 41\") in the Federal District \n18  Court for the Central District of California in Los Angeles, for a criminal search \n19 \n \n22 See, e.g., Matt Apuzzo, Former Espionage Suspect Sues, Accusing F.B.I. of Falsifying \n20 \nEvidence, N.Y.

The subsequent search of the \n3  Gartenlaub’s emails turned up no evidence of national security crimes, or \n4  any crimes whatsoever. \n5  Undaunted, Agent Harris applied to the top secret, ex parte FISC for a secret \n6  search warrant under FISA.  \n7  In 1978, Congress passed FISA because, for decades, the FBI and CIA \n8  engaged in illegal domestic surveillance of, and action against, U.S. citizens. \n9  Congress intended FISA, and the FISC, to prevent abuses of power by federal law \n26\n10  enforcement and intelligence agencies.  Thus, FISA limits searches targeting U.S. \n11  citizens to instances where there is probable cause that the citizen is an agent of a \n12  foreign power.27 This holds true whether for targeted surveillance, or a targeted \n28\n13  physical search.  \n14  In January 2014, the FISC approved Agent Harris's secret warrant \n15  application, presumably for the surveillance of Gartenlaub and a physical \n16  search of his home, computers and hard drives.29 The Defense has never had \n17  access to FISA Application, or been able to forensically examine, or \n18 \n19 \n \n25 (See AOB at 7.) \n20  26 The most infamous abuse being the FBI's COINTELPRO activities that politically targeted \nAmericans like Martin Luther King, Jr. See, e.g.,  S.

The Defense has never had access to any \n9  documentation of this unrestrained search and has seen no evidence that \n10  demonstrates that files on Gartenlaub's computers weren't altered in the \n30\n11  process.  \n12  In its Opposition Brief before the Ninth Circuit, the government \n13  acknowledges that there were no limitations to its secret search of Gartenlaub's \n14  hard drives, saying in a header:  \"The Government Was Permitted to Search Every \n15  File on Defendant's Computers....\"31 And nothing in the record indicates that the \n16  government used any standard forensic techniques routinely used to particularize \n17  computer searches like:  date limitations; targeted key word searches; image \n18  recognition scans; taint teams, or other routine, well established techniques to limit \n19  a digital search to its target and screen privileged, confidential, and irrelevant \n20  information. \n21  Despite its unlimited search, the FBI found no evidence that Gartenlaub had \n22  provided C-17 data to China, or otherwise acted as a spy for China. But the FBI \n23  did allegedly find, among the tens of thousands of files on the hard drives, a \n24  handful of files containing child pornography.

The FBI then pivoted to a \n2  theory that he collected child pornography based on its unreviewable - for \n3  the Defense - secret search that has never been tested in the adversarial \n4  process. The process which is the foundation of the criminal justice system \n5  because of national security doctrines articulated nowhere in the \n6  Constitution. \n7  The Fed. R. Crim. P. 41 Warrants Based on the Fruits of the FISA Warrant \n8  In August 2014, the FBI obtained a search warrant for Gartenlaub's \n9  premises seeking evidence that he received and possessed child \n10  pornography.32 The August 2014 warrant application based its probable \n11  cause on the fruits of the secret FISA warrant executed in January 2014, \n12  describing it as \"a court-authorized search without notice\" to the occupants. \n13  Of course, the government was seeking to seize and search computers it had \n14  already seized and searched and had unrestrained access to under the FISA \n15  search warrant. The probable cause affidavit further stated that the search \n16  discovered child pornography on Gartenlaub's hard drives.33 The District \n17  Court then granted the application for a normal Rule 41 search warrant. \n18  With its August 2014 search warrant, the FBI search seized the three \n19  hard drives that it had already secretly imaged and searched for months \n20  under the FISA warrant. It also allegedly seized a fourth hard drive from \n21  Gartenlaub that contained a copy of the \"Origdata\" folder structure that \n22  allegedly contained the same files as the other three hard drives. \n23 \n24 \n25 \n \n26  32 (ER 243.) \n33 (ER 248-49.) \n27 \n12 \n   \nNOTICE OF MOTION AND MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN \n \nSUPPORT OF 28 U.S.C. § 2255 HABEAS CORPUS PETITION \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-03711-ODW   Document 1-1   Filed 04/22/20   Page 17 of 28   Page ID #:45\n \n1  On October 23, 2014, a grand jury indicted Gartenlaub for receipt and \n2  possession of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2252A(a)(2) \n3  and 2252A(a)(5).34 \n4  Through pretrial motions, he: \n5  1.  Challenged and sought suppression of the fruits of the January 2014 FISA \n6  search and the August 2014 searches of his home, computers, and hard drives, on \n7  Fourth Amendment and other grounds, \n8  2.  Requested a hearing under Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978), to \n9  establish that the FISA Application, and the August 2014 search warrant \n10  application contained intentional or reckless material falsehoods and omissions, \n11  and \n12  3.  Sought disclosure of the underlying FISA Application and order.35  \n13  In response, the government submitted a largely classified, ex parte \n14  opposition to Gartenlaub's FISA challenges.36 The defense received a heavily \n15  redacted version of the government's opposition. The District Court reviewed the \n16  FISA Application and order, together with the classified portions of the \n17  government's opposition, in camera and ex parte. \n18  On August 6, 2015, in an 11-page opinion drafted by the government and \n19  signed unaltered by the District Court, the Court refused to disclose the FISA \n20  Application and order to the Defense, and denied Gartenlaub's motion to suppress \n21  the fruits of the FISA search.37 Later, however, the court expressed misgivings, \n22  stating \"I do have some personal questions regarding the propriety of the FISA \n23  court proceeding even though that certainly seems to be legally authorized.\"38 \n \n24  34 (See ER 243, 248-49, 296-97; AOB at 7). \n35 (District Ct.

The exact number isn't clear. A review by the \n4  National Center for Missing and Exploited Children identified 22 files. An \n5  additional 70 or so alleged child pornography files were identified by non-\n6  expert agents.39 \n7  The evidence at trial showed that the files date to 2005, when \n8  numerous people had access to Gartenlaub's computer while he lived at a \n9  beach house.40 No one knows who initially downloaded the files, or to what \n10  hard drive, or on to what computer.41 No new files were added after 2005, \n11  nor is there any definitive evidence that any of these files were opened until \n12  the FBI opened them in 2014.42 The child pornography files were copied, \n13  along with tens of thousands of other files in an enormous folder structure, \n14  to three other of Gartenlaub's hard drives. The files’ presence on four hard \n15  drives is consistent with someone copying the entire contents of an old hard \n16  drive to a newly purchased hard drive. No evidence, such as log files, screen \n17  shots, cached data, or chat logs of Mr. Gartenlaub ever visiting any sites \n18  related to child pornography exists. Likewise, there's no evidence or \n19  testimony of any type that Gartenlaub groomed, solicited, or had sex with, \n20  minors. There is no evidence of the type that one would expect to find \n21  related to someone who collects child pornography. \n22 \n23 \n \n24  39 (See, e.g., District Ct.

The IG Memo covers the period of October 2014 to \n12  September 2019. (Petitioner's FISA Application is from January 2014). It says in \n13  relevant part that the IG is not confident the FBI is following their own \n14  protocols designed to protect U.S. citizens from surveillance by the FBI.54 \n15  Of the 29 files they reviewed, the factual support part of the file (the “Woods \n16  Files”) for 4 were missing and may have never been created. The Memo \n17  notes “errors or inadequately supported facts in all of the 25 applications \n18  [with Woods Files] reviewed,” and that “FBI and NSD officials we \n19  interviewed indicated to us that there were no efforts by the FBI to use \n20  existing FBI and NSD oversight mechanisms to perform comprehensive, \n21  strategic assessments of the efficacy of the Woods Procedures or FISA \n22 \n23 \n \n24  50 The 2019 IG Report. \n51 Id. at viii. \n25 \n52 The 2020 IG Memo at p. 2-3. \n26  53 Id.  \n54 Id. \n27 \n16 \n   \nNOTICE OF MOTION AND MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN \n \nSUPPORT OF 28 U.S.C. § 2255 HABEAS CORPUS PETITION \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-03711-ODW   Document 1-1   Filed 04/22/20   Page 21 of 28   Page ID #:49\n \n1  accuracy, to include identifying the need for enhancements to training and \n55\n2  improvements in the process, or increased accountability measures.”  \n3  Argument \n4  The \"damning\" IG Report and Memo that document the \"systematic \n5  incompetence,\" of the FBI's FISA search warrant application practice and \n6  procedure is hitherto inaccessible new material evidence concealed by the \n7  government. This concealed evidence taints the integrity, credibility, and \n8  reliability of all the proceedings and evidence in this case.56 Given these \n9  revelations, the ex parte, in camera assertions of the government, whatever they \n10  may have been, concerning the integrity of its secret search, are unworthy of the \n11  presumption of credibility. The evidence of systemic and pervasive error is \n12  indispensable to any court’s review of this case. These are material facts that \n13  should have been presented to the jury. Any reasonable juror would, more likely \n14  than not, conclude that there's reasonable doubt as to integrity, credibility, and \n15  reliability of the government’s case. Particularly, when confronted with the \n16  government's pervasive and systemic errors in all the FISA applications reviewed \n17  to date, combined with the government's refusal to allow the Defense any access to \n18  its FISA Application and search. If the government wants to rebut this reasonable \n19  accusation of taint in this case, then it should produce the FISA Application and all \n20  related evidence to the Defense and subject it to testing in our adversarial system. \n21  Moreover, the government's concealment of the serious systemic errors in \n22  the FISA application process - doubtless aggravated by the FISA application \n23 \n24 \n \n55 Id.  \n25 \n56 Charlie Savage, Problems in FBI Wiretap Applications Go Beyond Trump Aide Surveillance, \n26  Review Finds: The Bureau has Routinely Botched Work on Surveillance Applications for its \nNational Security Investigations, An Inspector General Said, N.Y.

In the 33 years between 1979 and 2012, the FISC denied only \n6  11 secret FISA applications and granted the rest. The FISC has a 99.97% approval \n7  rating for warrant applications.57 This is only beat by the 100% error rate \n8  discovered by the Inspector General's review of FISA applications to date. \n9  There is no reason for the public to trust the integrity of the FISA application \n10  and FISC review process. Nor is there any reason for the courts to extend \n11  such trust when unsubstantiated national security interests are used to cloak \n12  a domestic criminal prosecution in secrecy and ex parte proceedings.  \n13 \nI.  This Court Should Vacate Petitioner's Conviction, or Order a New \n14  Trial, Because the Previously Unavailable New Evidence Taints the \nIntegrity of the Proceedings and Would Lead a Juror to Find \n15 \nReasonable Doubt \n16 \nNeither the District Court nor the Jury had the benefit of the IG's \n17 \nReport and Memo. The pattern of errors, omissions, and missing case files \n18 \ndocumented in the IG's Report and Memo evidence serious systemic and \n19 \ninstitutional practical and procedural flaws in every FISA application \n20 \nreviewed so far by the Inspector General. Reasonable Jurors when presented \n21 \nwith this evidence alongside the fact that the government refuses to disclose \n22 \nanything about the FISA Application would find reasonable doubt.

The New Evidence Would Lead a Jury to Find Reasonable Doubt \n6 \nThe Court should vacate Petitioner's conviction because the new evidence \n7 \nwould lead a jury to a finding of reasonable doubt. In order to overturn a \n8 \nconviction or grant a new trial based on new evidence it must be “more likely than \n9 \n59\nnot any reasonable juror would have reasonable doubt.”  In Schulp v. Deloi the \n10 \nUnited States Supreme Court held that the standard for habeas corpus actual \n11 \ninnocence on new evidence claims requires that “a petitioner must \"support his \n12 \nallegations of constitutional error with new reliable evidence - whether it be \n13 \nexculpatory scientific evidence, trustworthy eyewitness accounts, or critical \n14 \nphysical evidence-that was not presented at trial.\"”60 Then the habeas court will \n15 \nconsider \"all the evidence, old and new, incriminating and exculpatory, without \n16 \nregard to whether it would necessarily be admitted under rules of admissibility that \n17 \n61\nwould govern at trial.\"  All this is provided, however, that “the factual predicate \n18 \nfor the claim could not have been discovered previously through the exercise of \n19 \n62\ndue diligence.”  \n20 \nThere is no way that Petitioner could have discovered the systemic and \n21 \npervasive errors the Inspector General found. Gartenlaub has never had access to \n22 \n23 \n \n58 (Decl. of K. Gartenlaub, (Ex. A)); (Decl. of J. Fischbach, (Ex. B).) \n24  59 House v. Bell, 547 U.S. 518, 538 (2006). \n60 Schlup v.

What the IG Report and Memo indicate is \n2  that there's a high likelihood that Petitioner's FISA Application is tainted by \n3  the same lack of diligence and accuracy documented by the IG's Report or \n4  Memo. Implicit in the denial of Petitioner's access to his FISA Application \n5  and its underlying materials, as well as all the courts secret ex parte \n6  meetings with the government in this case, is that the FISA application \n7  process and search have integrity. The IG Memo and Report contradict this \n8  premise. \n9  The new evidence contained in the IG Report and Memo not only call \n10  into question the District Court's denial of Petitioner's motion for a Franks \n11  hearing and the Defense any access to the FISA Application and related \n12  evidence, it goes directly to the integrity, credibility, and reliability of the \n13  government's witnesses and evidence at trial. Given that every FISA \n14  application examined by the Inspector General so far contain errors and \n15  omissions, including four that are missing their case files entirely, it’s \n16  reasonable to expect that Petitioner's FISA Application, is tainted with errors \n17  and omissions. And again, if the government wishes to be trusted on this \n18  point then it should produce Petitioner's FISA Application and related \n19  evidence to the Defense for adversarial testing. Because the IG Report and \n20  Memo demonstrate that the government's representations as to the integrity \n21  of its FISA application practice and procedure can't be trusted. And in \n22  retrospect, what look like they could be isolated factual errors in Petitioner's \n23  case take on a different light in the context of the serious systemic problems \n24  the Inspector General documents. \n25 \n26 \n27 \n20 \n   \nNOTICE OF MOTION AND MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN \n \nSUPPORT OF 28 U.S.C. § 2255 HABEAS CORPUS PETITION \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-03711-ODW   Document 1-1   Filed 04/22/20   Page 25 of 28   Page ID #:53\n \nB.  The Court Should Grant a New Trial Because the New Evidence \n1 \nof Pervasive Errors in the FISA Application Process are Material \n2  and Taint the Integrity of the Proceedings \n3 \nThe District Court, had it been aware of the systemic errors \n4 \ndocumented in the IG Report and Memo, likely would have granted the Defense's \n5 \nFranks motion. The point of a Franks hearing is to test the validity of a \n6 \ngovernment search warrant application, and it’s reasonable to assume that a court \n7 \npresented with a list of systemic errors in other FISA applications would want to \n8 \ntest the FISA application in front of them for the same errors. Likewise, if the jury \n9 \nlearned of the serious pervasive errors in FISA applications it would put the \n10 \ngovernment's refusal to produce it in a different light. It follows that \"the likelihood \n11 \nof a different [trial] result is great enough to 'undermine [] confidence in the \n12 \noutcome of the trial.'\"63 \n13 \n14  II.  This Court Should Grant the Petition Because Lack of the New \nEvidence Denied Petitioner's Constitutional Right to Put on a Complete \n15 \nDefense \n16 \nHad the Defense known about the systemic errors and omissions \n17 \ndocumented in the IG's Report and Memo it would have materially impacted their \n18 \ncase in two ways. First, as the declarations of Petitioner and Jeff Fischbach, the \n19 \nDefense's computer expert at trial, attest, both of them would have aggressively \n20 \nsought to have Mr. Fischbach testify not only to the government's faulty forensics, \n21 \nbut on the fact that the FISA search is an evidentiary black hole to the Defense. \n22 \nSecond, as both attached Declarations assert,64 the Defense would have \n23 \naggressively sought to place the issue of FISA in front of the jury. The fact that \n24 \nthey were denied this evidence, through no lack of due diligence on their part, \n25 \n \n26  63 Smith v. Cain, 565 U.S. 73, 75-76 (2012) (quoting Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 434 (1995). \n64 (Decl. of Fischbach, P. 2 Lns. 18-25 (Ex. B)); (Decl. of Gartenlaub, ¶¶ 2-3 (Ex. A).) \n27 \n21 \n   \nNOTICE OF MOTION AND MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN \n \nSUPPORT OF 28 U.S.C. § 2255 HABEAS CORPUS PETITION \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-03711-ODW   Document 1-1   Filed 04/22/20   Page 26 of 28   Page ID #:54\n \n65\n1  constitutes a denial of Gartenlaub's right to put on a complete defense.  The \n2  test is not whether the new evidence necessitates a different verdict, but \n3  rather whether its lack deprived Petitioner of a fair trial.66  \n4  As Mr. Fischbach states in his declaration, had he known about the \n5  systematic and pervasive errors in the FISA application process he would \n6  have insisted on testifying. Fischbach sets out in his declaration how he \n7  would have noted any discrepancies between the two search warrants, would \n8  have insisted on putting the FISA search in front of the jury to make clear \n9  the second search was based on the fruits of the FISA search, and that there \n10  were anomalies in the government’s evidence which could have been the \n67\n11  result of FBI errors.  He further would have testified that the evidence was \n12  consistent with no one having ever opened the files after they were \n13  downloaded in 2005, and that in fact someone other than Gartenlaub \n14  downloaded them. This would certainly have raised reasonable doubt in the \n15  eyes of the jury when viewed together with the evidence that Gartenlaub did \n16  not share any of the normal markers of a child pornographer such as \n17  continuous collection of such materials – a fact that even the judge found \n18  remarkable. \n19 \n20 \n \n65 See Su Chia v. Cambra, 360 F.3d 997, 1003-04 (9th Cir. 2004);California v. Trombetta, 467 \n21 \nU.S. 479, 485 (1984); see also, United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 656 (1984); Crane v. \nKentucky, 476 U.S. 683, 690-91 (1986). \n22 \n66 See Hall v. Dir. of Corr., 343 F.3d 976, 983-84 (9th Cir. Cal. September 8, 2003) (“The \n23  question is not whether the defendant would more likely than not have received a different \nverdict with the evidence, but whether in its absence he received a fair trial, understood as a trial \n24 \nresulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.”); Kyles, 514 U.S. at 434 (reversing and remanding \nwhere evidence, undisclosed by the state, was found to be \"material,\" meaning that it was \n25 \nfavorable to the defendant, and the absence of this evidence at trial undermined confidence in the \n26  outcome of the trial). \n67 (Decl. of Fischbach, P. 3 Lns. 1-4 (Ex.

The Court Should Grant a New Trial to Subject the FISA \n1 \nApplication to Discovery and the Adversarial Process \n2 \n3  The facts surrounding the technology of copying and accessing files \n4  was complex and proved confusing for both the judge and the jury. The \n5  defendant’s expert witness, has a great deal of experience testifying in child \n68\n6  pornography cases and is highly credentialed.  At a new trial Mr. Fischbach \n7  would testify to the proper protocols for executing FISA searches and \n8  surveillance; that deficiencies in following proper protocols may have \n9  resulted in damaged or destroyed evidence; and that there was no evidence \n69\n10  of who downloaded the files or that they had ever been viewed.  And any \n11  new trial would involve a Franks motion and a renewed demand to see the FISA \n12  Application and supporting materials at issue here. \n13 \nB.  The Court Should Grant a New Trial so the New Evidence and \n14  FISA Search Can be Argued to a Jury \n15 \nThe Jury in this case never learned of the FISA search that led to all the \n16 \nevidence in this case. The systemic errors documented by the IG Report and Memo \n17 \ngo directly to the weight and credibility of the government's case because it proves \n18 \nthe government's FISA application process is unreliable. Missing case files for top-\n19 \nsecret, ex parte search warrants applications in matters where the government \n20 \nseeks to deprive someone of their liberty does not inspire confidence in the \n21 \ngovernment's procedure. Combine that with the fact that the FISA search in this \n22 \ncase is an evidentiary black hole for the Defense because the government refuses to \n23 \nlet the Defense see it raises the possibility that the real reason the government is \n24 \nhiding the file is not national security interests but self-interests.  \n25 \n \n26  68 (Id. at P. 1 Lns. 3-10.) \n69 (Id. at P. 3.) \n27 \n23 \n   \nNOTICE OF MOTION AND MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN \n \nSUPPORT OF 28 U.S.C. § 2255 HABEAS CORPUS PETITION \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-03711-ODW   Document 1-1   Filed 04/22/20   Page 28 of 28   Page ID #:56\n \nIII.  In the Interests of Justice the Court Should Life Petitioner's Onerous \n1 \nLifetime Probation Which Severely Hampers His Ability to Work and \n2  Live \n3 \nMr. Gartenlaub has served his time but as things stand, his \n4 \nKafkaesque experience will never end. For the rest of his life he will be on \n5 \nprobation. He will have to remain on a sex offender registry. He will be \n6 \nprevented from living in certain locations and the government will track his \n7 \nmovements and whereabouts. \n8 \nIf this court cannot bring itself to overturn this conviction or grant a \n9 \nnew trial, we ask that this court in the interest of justice, vacate Gartenlaub’s \n10 \nlifetime probation so he may move on. \n11 \nConclusion \n12 \nThe Department of Justice's Inspector General's Report and Memo \n13 \ndocumenting systemic incompetence, errors, and omissions - including \n14 \nmissing case files for FISA applications - taint the integrity of the \n15 \nproceedings in this case and corrode the public's trust in our criminal justice \n16 \nsystem. The Court should vacate Mr. Gartenlaub's conviction, or in the \n17 \nalternative, grant a new trial or vacate his lifetime probation.  \n18 \n \n19 \nDATED:  April 22, 2020               TOR EKELAND LAW, PLLC \n20             \n              By: /s/ Mark Jaffe \n21 \n \n22                Mark Jaffe \n              Tor Ekeland (NYS Bar No. TE5608)   \n23 \n           \n24                Pro Bono Attorneys for Petitioner  \n25   \n26   \n27 \n24 \n   \nNOTICE OF MOTION AND MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN \n \nSUPPORT OF 28 U.S.C. § 2255 HABEAS CORPUS PETITION \n ",

I  am  a  Special  Agent  (\"SA\")  with  the  Federal  Bureau  of \nInvestigation  (\"FBI\"),  and  I  have  been  so  employed  for \napproximately  eight  years.  During  my  career  as  a  Special  Agent, \nI  have  investigated violations  of  federal  law  related  to  crimes \nagainst  children,  bank  robberies,  counterterrorism,  and \ncounterintelligence.  I  have  also  participated  in  investigations \nconducted  by  the  Organized  Crime  Drug  Enforcement  Task  Force \n(\"OCDETF\"),  and  the  Safe  Streets  Task  Force  (\"SSTF\"). \nCurrently,  I  conduct  investigations  related to  computer \nintrusions,  commonly  referred  to  as  \"hacking.\"  During  my  time \nas  an  F.B.I.  Special  Agent,  I  have  directed  or  participated  in \nthe  execution  of  child pornography  and  child prostitution  search \nwarrants  and  arrests. \nII.  PURPOSE  OF  AFFIDAVIT \n2.  This  affidavit  is made  in  support  of  a  criminal \ncomplaint  and  arrest  warrant  charging  KEITH  GARTENLAUB \n(\"GARTENLAUB\")  with  a  violation  of  Title  18,  United  States  Code, \nSection  2252A(a) (5) (B)  (possession  of  child pornography) .1 \n1  \"Child  pornography\"  is  defined  for  §  2252A  in \n§  2256(8)  as  any  visual  depiction,  including  any  photograph, \nfilm,  video,  picture,  or  computer  or  computer  generated  image  or \npicture,  whether  made  or  produced  by  electronic,  mechanical,  or \nother  means  of  sexually  explicit  conduct  involving  the  use  of  a \nminor  engaged  in  said  conduct.  \"Sexually  explicit  conduct\"  is \n1 \n\nCase 8:14-cr-00173-CAS   Document 1   Filed 08/27/14   Page 3 of 19   Page ID #:3\n3.  The  facts  set  forth  in  this  affidavit  are  based  on  my \npersonal  observations,  my  training  and  experience,  and \ninformation  obtained  from  various  law  enforcement  personnel  and \nwitnesses.  This  affidavit  is  intended  to  show  that  there  is \nsufficient  probable  cause  for  the  requested  criminal  complaint \nand  does  not  purport  to  set  forth  all  of my  knowledge  of  or \ninvestigation  into  this  matter.  Unless  specifically indicated \notherwise,  all  dates  noted  in  this  affidavit  are  on  or  about  the \ndate  listed. \nIII.  SUMMARY  OF  INVESTIGATION \nA.  Summary  of Probable  Cause \n4.  On  January  29,  2014,  and  January  30,  2014,  agents \nconducted  a  court-authorized  search  without  notice  to  the \nresidents  of  95  Danbury  Lane,  a  house  located  in  Irvine, \nCalifornia  (the  \"Danbury  Residence\"),  where  KEITH  GARTENLAUB \n(\"GARTENLAUB\") 2  then  resided with  his  wife,  Tess  Yi  (a.k.a.  Tess \nGartenlaub).  During  the  search,  agents  obtained  forensic  images \ndefined  for§  2252A  in§ 2256(2)  and  includes  sexual \nintercourse,  including  oral-genital  or  anal  genital,  whether \nbetween  persons  of  the  same  gender  or  different  genders,  or  the \nlascivious  exhibition  of  the  genitals  or  pubic  area  of  any \nperson. \n2  GARTENLAUB  works  in  the  information  technology  group \nof  a  large  corporation,  and  has  worked  there  for  several  years. \nSpecifically,  GARTENLAUB  works  as  an  application  administrator \nfor  several  computer  applications  that  run  in  Unix  or  Microsoft \nWindows  operating  system  environments.  GARTENLAUB  thus \nregularly  works  with  computers  running  Windows  or  Unix  operating \nsystems  and  is  highly  proficient  with  computers  running  either \nof  these  operating  systems. \n2 \n\nCase 8:14-cr-00173-CAS   Document 1   Filed 08/27/14   Page 4 of 19   Page ID #:4\nand  copies  of  multiple  hard  drives  and  other  digital  devices. \nSubsequent  analysis  of  these  forensic  images  revealed  that  three \nof  the  hard  drives  contained  child pornography.  As  explained  in \ndetail  below,  the  locations  of  the  video  files  within  the \noverall  file  structure  of  the  hard  drives  indicated  that  they \nbelonged  to  GARTENLAUB. \nB.  GARTENLAUB  Lived  at  the  Danbury  Residence  in  January  2014 \n5.  Documents  obtained  pursuant  to  a  search  warrant  for \nthe  e-mail  account  \"Kgartenlaub@yahoo.com\"  indicated that \nGARTENLAUB  and  his  wife,  Yi,  lived  at  the  Danbury  Residence \nuntil  March  2014.  Among  other  documents,  agents  obtained: \na.  A  property  insurance  policy  for  the  Danbury \nResidence,  dated August  21,  2009,  and  bearing  the  notarized \nsignatures  of  Keith  and  Tess  Gartenlaub; \nb.  A  loan  application  dated April  24,  2013,  in  the \nname  of  \"Tess  Gartenlaub.\"  The  application  identifies  \"Keith \nGartenlaub\"  as  Tess  Gartenlaub's  spouse  and  indicates  that  their \naddress  was  the  Danbury  Residence.  The  application  contains \nTess  Gartenlaub's  social  security number  and  date  of  birth,  as \nwell  as  GARTENLAUB's  social  security  number  and  date  of  birth; \nc.  A  credit  report  dated  April  24,  2013,  prepared \nfor  \"Keith  P.  Gartenlaub.\"  The  report  indicated  that  Keith \nGartenlaub's  address  was  the  Danbury  Residence,  and  accurately \nidentified his  employer.  The  report  also  contains  GARTENLAUB's \ncorrect  year  of  birth,  as  well  as  accurate  identification \n3 \n\nCase 8:14-cr-00173-CAS   Document 1   Filed 08/27/14   Page 5 of 19   Page ID #:5\nnumbers  for  several  financial  accounts  in  GARTENLAUB's  name; \nand, \nd.  A  lease  agreement  dated  May  1,  2013,  between \nKeith  and  Tess  Gartenlaub  and  another  person,  for  a  commercial \nproperty  in  Laguna  Beach,  California,  that  is  the  location  of  a \nbusiness  jointly owned  by  Tess  Gartenlaub  and  GARTENLAUB. \n6.  Records  provided  by  Cox  Communications  indicated  that \n\"Keith  Gartenlaub\"  maintained  a  subscription  for  Internet \nservice  at  the  Danbury  Residence,  as  of  January  8,  2014. \n7.  Based  on  physical  surveillance  conducted  by  the  F.B.I. \non  and  after March  30,  2014,  described  below,  I  believe  that \nGARTENLAUB  no  longer  resides  at  the  Danbury  Residence.  In \naddition,  based  on  physical  surveillance  on  multiple  occasions \nin  July  and  August  2014,  I  believe  that  GARTENLAUB  and  his  wife \nTess  Yi  now  reside  at  22956  Caminito  Rio,  Laguna  Hills, \nCalifornia. \nC.  Search  Revealed  Hard Drives  Containing  Child Pornography \n8.  During  the  January  2014  searches  of  the  Danbury \nResidence  the  F.B.I.  obtained  digital  or  forensic  images3  of  the \nfiles  stored ,on  multiple  hard  drives  and  other  digital  devices, \nalthough  the  digital  devices  themselves  were  not  seized. \n3  A  forensic  image  or  digital  image  is  a  copy  of  the \nfiles  saved  on  a  digital  device,  like  a  computer  hard  drive.  By \nexamining  the  image  of  a  hard  drive,  a  forensic  examiner  can \ndetermine  what  files  were  stored  on  the  hard  drive  at  the  time \nthe  image  was  made. \n4 \n\nCase 8:14-cr-00173-CAS   Document 1   Filed 08/27/14   Page 6 of 19   Page ID #:6\n9.  Two  of  these  forensic  images  were  obtained  from  hard \ndrives  installed in  a  Dell  Optiplex  GX270  mini-tower  computer. \nThe  first  hard  drive  was  a  Hitachi  brand  hard  drive,  model \nnumber  IC35L090AVV207-0,  serial  number  VNVC02G3GU6EMT \n(hereinafter  \"the  Hitachi  hard  drive\").  The  second  hard  drive \nwas  a  Western  Digital  brand  hard  drive,  model  number  1600JB-\nOOGVAO,  serial  number  WCAL91235199  (hereinafter  \"the  Western \nDigital  hard  drive\").  A  third  copy  that  was  not  a  forensic \nimage  was  obtained  from  a  hard  drive  installed  in  a  different \ndesktop  computer,  an  Acer  Desktop  AME600-UR378.  The  third  hard \ndrive  was  a  two-terabyte,  Seagate  brand  hard  drive,  model  number \nST200DM001-1CH164,  serial  number  ZlE2DAMG  (hereinafter  \"the \nSeagate  hard  drive\") .4 \n1.  Child Pornography  on  the  Hitachi  hard drive  and  the \nWestern  Digital hard  drive  (Dell  Optiplex  Computer) \n10.  An  examination  of  the  forensic  images  of  the  Hitachi \nand  Western  Digital  hard  drives  revealed  that  both  hard  drives \ncontained  a  folder  labeled  \"OrigData,\"  which  contained  nearly-\n4  Based  on  my  training  and  experience  and  discussions \nwith  other  special  agents,  I  know  that  personal  computer \nsuppliers,  like  Dell  and  Acer,  often  incorporate  component  parts \nmanufactured  by  other  suppliers  of  computer  parts.  For  example, \nDell,  a  computer  supplier,  may  use  hard  drives  manufactured  by \nother  companies,  like  Hitachi  or  Western  Digital,  in  the \ncomputers  it sells.  Similarly,  a  computer  user  can  also  connect \nadditional  hard  drives  to  a  computer  after purchasing  it. \nBecause  the  forensic  images  made  were  made  of  the  storage  media \n-i.e.,  the  hard  drives--it  is  the  contents  of  the  storage  media \nthat  are  described  herein.  Based  on  and  my  discussions  with  an \nagent  who  was  present,  the  hard  drives  identified above  were \nconnected  to  the  two  respective  desktop  computers--one  made  by \nDell  and  one  made  by  Acer--described  above. \n5 \n\nCase 8:14-cr-00173-CAS   Document 1   Filed 08/27/14   Page 7 of 19   Page ID #:7\nidentical  collections  of  child pornography  (as  discussed  in \ngreater  detail  below,  the  Seagate  hard  drive  also  contained \nchild pornography,  specifically copies  of  nearly  the  same  child \npornography  collections  stored  on  the  Hitachi  and  Western \nDigital  hard  drives).  For  example,  the  following  video  files \nwere  saved  on  both  the  Hitachi  hard  drive  and  the  Western \nDigital  hard  drive  (and,  as  described  below,  copies  of  these \nfiles  were  also  found  on  the  Seagate  hard  drive): \na.  \"VickycompleteR.mpg,\"  which  depicts  a \nprepubescent  girl  orally  copulating  an  adult  male,  among  other \nsexually  explicit  conduct.  The  girl  is  approximately  10  to  12 \nyears  old.  The  video  is  approximately  10  minutes  long.  It was \nsaved  in  a  folder  labeled \"vi\"  on  both· the  Hitachi  hard  drive \nand  the  Western  Digital  hard  drive; \nb.  \"childfuck.mpg,\"  which  depicts  a  prepubescent \ngirl  lying  on  a  table,  while  an  adult  male  penetrates  her  anus \nand  vagina  with  his  finger.  The  girl  is  approximately  10  to  12 \nyears  old.  The  video  is  approximately  1  minute,  30  seconds \nlong.  It was  saved  in  a  folder  labeled  \"anp\"  on  both  the \nHitachi  hard  drive  and  Western  Digital  hard  drive; \nc.  \"R@ygold'sSleepingBeauty(1) .mpg,\"  which  depicts  a \nprepubescent  girl whose  genitals  are  exposed,  being  touched  by \nan  adult  male's  penis.  The  girl,  who  is  approximately  10  to  12 \nyears  old,  is  completely  naked  and  appears  to  be  unconscious. \nThe  video  is  approximately  four  minutes  long.  It was  saved  in  a \n6 \n\nCase 8:14-cr-00173-CAS   Document 1   Filed 08/27/14   Page 8 of 19   Page ID #:8\nfolder  labeled  \"yg\"  on  both  the  Hitachi  hard  drive  and  the \nWestern  Digital  hard  drive; \nd.  \"R@ygoldStyle-VickyCompilation(14m58s) .asf,\" \nwhich  depicts  a  prepubescent  girl  orally  copulating  an  adult \nmale,  among  other  sexually  explicit  conduct.  The  girl  is \napproximately  10  to  12  years  old.  During  part  of  the  video,  the \ngirl's  hands  and  feet  bound  by  rope.  A  separate  piece  of  rope, \ntied around  the  girl's neck,  connects  to  the  rope  binding  her \nankles  together.  The  video  is  approximately  14  minutes  long. \nIt was  saved  in  a  folder  labeled  \"vi\"  on  both  the  Hitachi  hard \ndrive  and  the  Western  Digital  hard  drive; \ne.  \"R@ygoldstylebabyjgod.mpg,\"  which  depicts  a \nprepubescent  girl's  genitals  being  penetrated  by  an  adult  male's \npenis,  while  her  ankles  ire  restrained by  rope.  The  video  is \napproximately  1  minute,  30  seconds  long.  It was  saved  in  a \nfolder  labeled  \"anp\"  on  both  the  Hitachi  hard  drive  and  the \nWestern  Digital  hard  drive; \nf.  \"R@ygoldpeggy.avi,\"  which  contains  four  scenes \ndepicting  two  prepubescent  children,  a  boy  and  a  girl,  engaged \nin  sexually  explicit  conduct.  The  girl  and  the  boy  are  both \napproximately  10  to  12  years  old.  The  first  scene  depicts  the \ngirl's  genitals  being  penetrated by  an  adult  male.  The  second \nscene  depicts  the  girl  orally  copulating  the  boy.  The  third \nscene  depicts  the  boy  orally  copulating  the  girl.  The  fourth \nscene  depicts  the  boy  and  girl  orally  copulating  an  adult  male. \nThe  video  is  approximately  12  minutes  long.  It was  saved  in  a \n7 \n\nCase 8:14-cr-00173-CAS   Document 1   Filed 08/27/14   Page 9 of 19   Page ID #:9\nfolder  labeled  \"BAD\"  on  both  the  Hitachi  hard  drive  and  the \nWestern  Digital  hard  drive; \ng.  \"BabyJ-su.avi,\"  which  depicts  a  prepubescent \ngirl's  genitals  being  penetrated by  an  adult  male.  The  girl  is \napproximately  six  to  eight  years  old.  The  video  is \napproximately  1  minute  long.  It was  saved  in  a  folder  labeled \n\"yg\"  on  both  the  Hitachi  hard  drive  and  the  Western  Digital  hard \ndrive;  and \nh.  \"BabyJ-Hole.avi,\"  which  depicts  a  prepubescent \ngirl  being  fondled  and  then  vaginally  penetrated  by  an  adult \nmale.  The  girl  is  approximately  six  to  eight  years  old.  The \nvideo  is  approximately  1  minute,  30  seconds  long.  It was  saved \nin  a  folder  labeled  \"yg\"  on  both  the  Hitachi  hard  drive  and  the \nWestern  Digital  hard  drive. \n11.  In  addition  to  being  stored  in  the  OrigData  folders \nsaved  on  the  Hitachi  and  Western  digital  hard  drives,  each  of \nthe  videos  described  above  was  also  stored  in  the  two  OrigData \nfolders  saved  on  the  Seagate  hard  drive. \n12.  On  June  3,  2014,  I  sent  a  DVD  containing  videos  of \nsuspected  child pornography  obtained  from  the  Hitachi,  Western \nDigital,  and  Seagate  hard  drives  to  the  National  Center  for \nExploited  Children  (\"NCMEC\") .  NCMEC  reported  that  some  of  the \nvideo  files  contained  images  of  identified minor  victims, \nincluding  four  of  the  files  identified  above,  specifically: \n\"VickycompleteR.mpg,\"  \"R@ygoldStyle-\nVickyCompilation(14m58s) .asf,\"  \"R@ygoldpeggy.avi,\"  and  \"BabyJ-\n8 \n\nCase 8:14-cr-00173-CAS   Document 1   Filed 08/27/14   Page 10 of 19   Page ID #:10\nsu.avi.\"  NCMEC  also  reported  that  many  of  the  video  files \ndepicting  an  identified victim had  been  investigated  outside  of \nCalifornia,  indicating  that  the  video  files  traveled  in \ninterstate  or  foreign  commerce  because  they  were  found  on  hard \ndrives  located  in  California. \n2.  Child Pornography  on  the  Seagate  hard  drive  (Acer \nDesktop AME600-UR378  Computer) \n13.  An  examination  of  the  copy  of  the  Seagate  hard  drive, \nthe  storage  drive  for  the  Acer  desktop  computer,  revealed  that \nit,  too,  contained  child pornography.  One  of  the  folders  saved \non  the  Seagate  hard  drive  was  labeled  \"edrive.\"  Among  other \nfiles,  the  edrive  folder  contained  an  identical  copy  of  the \nOrigData  folder  saved  on  the  Hitachi  hard  drive,  including  each \nof  the  video  files  described  above  in  paragraph  10.  Similarly, \nanother  one  of  the  folders  saved  on  the  Seagate  hard  drive  was \nlabeled  \"fdrive.\"  The  fdrive  folder  contained  an  identical  copy \nof  the  OrigData  folder  saved  on  the  Western  Digital  hard  drive, \nincluding  each  of  the  video  files  described  above  in  paragraph \n10. \n14.  An  e-mail  obtained pursuant  to  court-authorized \nsurveillance  of  the  e-mail  account:  \"Kgartenlaub@yahoo.com\" \nindicated  that  GARTENLAUB  bought  the  computer  containing  the \nSeagate  hard  drive,  an  Acer  Desktop  AME600-UR378,  on  October  10, \n2013,  from  Costco.com.  Because  identical  copies  of  the  OrigData \nfolders  saved  on  the  Hitachi  hard  drive  and  the  Western  Digital \nhard  drive  were  found  on  the  Seagate  hard  drive,  the  OrigData \n9 \n\nCase 8:14-cr-00173-CAS   Document 1   Filed 08/27/14   Page 11 of 19   Page ID #:11\nfolders  must  have  been  copied  to  the  Seagate  hard  drive  after \nOctober  10,  2013,  when  GARTENLAUB  ordered  the  computer  that \ncontained  the  Seagate  hard  drive.  Because  the  OrigData  folders \ncontained  files  that  appear  to  have  been  created by  GARTENLAUB \n(described  below  in  Part  D),  I  suspect  that  GARTENLAUB  copied \nthe  OrigData  folders,  including  the  video  files  described  above \nin  paragraph  10  to  the  Seagate  hard  drive. \nD.  Search  Results  Indicate  That  GARTENLAUB  Stored  the  Child \nPornography  Found During  the  Search \n1.  GARTENLAUB's  Personal  Documents  and  Communications \n15.  In  addition  to  child pornography,  each  of  the  OrigData \nfolders  saved  to  the  hard  drives  also  contained  a  subfolder \nlabeled  \"OldSystem\"  containing more  than  a  dozen  documents  that \nappear  to  have  been  written  by  GARTENLAUB,  some  as  early  as \n1997.  For  example,  each  of  the  \"OldSystem\"  folders  contained \nthe  following  files: \na.  A  document  saved  as  \"American.doc,\"  dated \nSeptember  16,  1997,  which  is  a  letter  from  GARTENLAUB  to \nAmerican  Airlines  regarding  the  airline's  customer  service; \nb.  A  document  saved  as  \"deltabitch.doc,\"  dated \nSeptember  29,  1997,  which  is  a  letter  from  GARTENLAUB  to  Delta \nAirlines  regarding  the  airline's  customer  service; \nc.  A  document  saved  as  \"creditbureu2.doc,\"  dated \nAugust  7,  1999,  which  is  a  letter  from  GARTENLAUB  to  the  Trans \nUnion  Corporation.  The  letter  includes  GARTENLAUB's  social \nsecurity  number,  and  previous  phone  number,  and  address. \n10 \n\nCase 8:14-cr-00173-CAS   Document 1   Filed 08/27/14   Page 12 of 19   Page ID #:12\n16.  An  examination  of  the  forensic  images  and  copies \nobtained  from  the  hard  drives  also  revealed  a  saved  copy  of  an \ne-mail  that  GARTENLAUB  sent  to  a  coworker  on  July  3,  2002.  The \ne-mail,  which  was  not  sent  from  \"Kgartenlaub@yahoo.com,\" \ncontained  three  attachments.  The  recipient,  at  an  e-mail \naddress  with  a  domain  associated  with  GARTENLAUB's  employer, \nreplied  in  part  \"Thanks  Keith.\"  The  e-mail  that  GARENTLAUB  sent \nin  response  was  signed  \"Keith\"  and  contained  GARTENLAUB's \nprevious  home  telephone  number. \n17.  An  examination  of  the  forensic  images  and  copies \nobtained  from  the  hard  drives  found  no  files  or  documents  within \nthe  OrigData  folders,  or  among  its  contents,  that  appeared  to \nhave  been  created,  modified,  or  accessed  by  Tess  Yi.  For \nexample,  a  separate  folder  called  \"Data\"  on  the  Hitachi  hard \ndrive  contained  folders  for  \"Keith,\"  \"Owner,\"  and  \"Tess.\"  The \nfolder~ labeled \"Keith\"  and  \"Tess\"  each  contained  files  that \nappeared  to  correspond  to  GARTENLAUB  and  Tess  Yi  respectively, \nsuch  as  photographs  or  other  documents.  (The  \"Owner\"  account \ncontained  no  files.)  The  OrigData  folder  was  stored  in  a \ndifferent  folder  that  did  not  appear  to  contain  any  files \ncorresponding  to  Yi.  Moreover,  as  explained below,  the  files \ncontained  in  the  OrigData  folders  had  been  saved  in  a  way  that \nsuggests  that  GARTENLAUB  organized  them. \n11 \n\nCase 8:14-cr-00173-CAS   Document 1   Filed 08/27/14   Page 13 of 19   Page ID #:13\n2.  GARTENLAUB's  Concealment  of Child Pornography  in \nDisguised Folder  Locations \n18.  In  addition  to  this  evidence  showing  that  GARTENLAUB \nused  the  computers  that  contained  each  of  the  hard  drives,  there \nis  additional  evidence  showing  that  GARTENLAUB  was  the  one  who \nstored  and  organized  the  child pornography  found  in  the \n~origData\" folders  stored  on  the  hard  drives.  Each  of  the \nOrigData  folders  was  stored  within  several  other  folderp, \nsuggesting  that  the  person  who  saved  the  child pornography  to \nthe  hard  drives  deliberately  stored  it where  it would  not  be \ndiscovered  easily or  by  accident.  For  the  reasons  set  forth \nherein,  the  evidence  shows  that  this  person  was  GARTENLAUB. \n19.  Each  of  the  child pornography  files  described  in \nparagraph  10  had  been  hidden  below  several  additional  layers  of \nfile  folders  contained within  the  OrigData  folders,  which \nfurther  shows  that  GARTENLAUB  saved  the  child pornography  in  a \nmanner  that  would  help  to  conceal  it.  For  example,  as  described \nabove,  on  the  Western  Digital  hard  drive  the  child-pornography \nfile  ~R@ygoldstylebabyjgod.mpg,\" was  saved  in  a  folder  labeled \n~anp.\"  This  folder  was  one  of  several  stored  in  a  folder \nlabeled  ~tmp1,\" which  was  one  of  thirteen  folders  stored  in  the \nfolder  ~nmp.\"  ~[N]mp\" was  stored  in  a  folder  labeled  ~New \nFolder,\"  which  was  one  of  at  least  six  folders  stored  in  the \nOrigData  folder.  The  placement  of  child pornography  deep  within \nthe  hard  drives'  file  directories  suggests  that  the  files  were \nsaved  by  someone  who,  like  GARTENLAUB,  is  proficient  with \ncomputers.

The  Seagate  hard  drive  contained  two \n13 \n\nCase 8:14-cr-00173-CAS   Document 1   Filed 08/27/14   Page 15 of 19   Page ID #:15\namong  the  contents.  For  example,  the  OrigData  folder  on  one \nhard  drive  might  not  contain  a  subfolder  that  did  exist  in  the \nOrigData  folder  saved  on  another  hard  drive.  Similarly,  some  of \nthe  files  stored  in  all  four  OrigData  folders  were  saved  in \ndifferent  subfolders.  Based  on  my  training  and  experience  and \nmy  conversations  with  other  agents,  I  believe  these  differences \nwere  likely due  to  GARTENLAUB  having  added,  deleted,  or  moved \ncertain  files  over  time,  which  indicates  that  GARTENLAUB  has \ncontinued  to  modify  and  access  the  files--including  the  child \npornography  files--within  the  \"OrigData\"  folder. \n22.  One  of  the  file  folders  contained  in  both  the  OrigData \nfolders  on  the  Hitachi  hard  drive  and  the  edrive  folder  of  the \nSeagate  hard  drive  was  labeled  \"tmp.\"  The  tmp  folders,  in  turn, \ncontained  several  folders,  some  of  which  contained  suspected \nchild pornography.  I  know,  based  on  conversations  with \nexperienced  agents,  that  the  Microsoft  Windows  operating  system \n-- which  was  the  operating  system  installed on  the  Hitachi, \nWestern  Digital,  and  Acer  hard  drives  -- automatically  installs \na  folder  called \"Temp\"  that  stores  temporary  files. \n23.  Unix  operating  systems,  by  contrast,  automatically \ninstall  a  similarly-named  folder  for  temporary  files,  but  that \nfolder  is  called  \"tmp.\"  I  learned  from  other  agents  who \ninterviewed  GARTENLAUB  that  he  works  as  an  application \nadministrator  for  several  applications  that  run  in  both  Unix  and \ncopies  of  the  OrigData  folder,  one  in  a  folder  labeled  edrive \nand  another  in  a  folder  labeled  fdrive. \n14 \n\nCase 8:14-cr-00173-CAS   Document 1   Filed 08/27/14   Page 16 of 19   Page ID #:16\nWindows  environments.  This  shows  that  the  use  of  the  folder \nname  was  designed  to  be  deceptive,  because  it would  lead  a \ncasual  computer  user,  or  an  investigating  law  enforcement  agent, \nto  conclude  that  the  folders  contained  only  innocuous,  system \ngenerated  files,  rather  than  contraband,  like  the  child \npornography  found  in  subfolders  in  each  of  the  OrigData  folders. \n24.  In  light  of  GARTENLAUB's  familiarity  with  computers \nrunning  Unix-based  operating  systems,  I  believe  that  GARTENLAUB \nnamed  the  \"tmp\"  file  so  that  a  cursory  inspection  of  the  hard \ndrives'  file  structures  would  suggest  that  the  \"tmp\"  folder \ncontained  only  innocuous,  temporary  files,  rather  than \ncontraband.  Only  someone  like  GARTENLAUB,  who  works \nprofessionally  with  computers  running  Unix-based  operating \nsystems,  would  likely have  labeled  the  folder  \"tmp,\"  which  is \nthe  same  name  as  an  automatically-generated  folder  on  Unix \nsystems,  rather  than  \"temp,\"  which  is  the  name  of  an  analogous \nfolder  on  Windows-based  systems. \n25.  Similarly,  the  OrigData  folder  stored  on  the  Hitachi \nhard  drive,  contains  a  folder  called \"system\"  in  the  following \nlocation:  \"OrigData/tmp/Administrator/system,\"  which  contains \nmultiple  pornographic  videos  and  images.  Although  \"system\"  is \nalso  the  name  of  a  folder  that  is  automatically  installed by  the \nWindows  operating  systems,  this  is  not  the  location  where  it is \ninstalled. \n26.  Other  evidence  has  also  shown  that  GARTENLAUB  is \nfamiliar  with  and  uses  these  folder  locations.  GARTENLAUB's \n15 \n\nCase 8:14-cr-00173-CAS   Document 1   Filed 08/27/14   Page 17 of 19   Page ID #:17\nemployer  has  been  monitoring  GARTENLAUB's  computer  use.  On \nJanuary  1,  2014,  the  screenshots  captured  by  GARTENLAUB's \nemployer  show  that  GARTENLAUB  logged  into  his  home  computer  via \na  network  using  his  work  computer.  Once  he  had  logged  in, \nGARTENLAUB  navigated  to  a  computer  \"BOB,\"  which  is  the  computer \nname  for  the  Acer  desktop  with  the  Seagate  hard  drive.  Once \naccessing  that  computer,  GARTENLAUB  navigated  to  the  following \nfolder:  BOB\\Users\\Keith\\Downloads\\Movies\\Keep\\New  Folder\\. \nOnce  GARTENLAUB  was  in  that  folder  called  \"New  Folder,\"  he \ncreated  a  new  folder  that  he  named  \"Recycle.\"  The  Windows \noperating  system  automatically  installs  a  folder  with  the  same \nname,  but  in  a  different  location.  This  shows  that  GARTENLAUB \nuses  folders  buried multiple  layers  deep  and  named  as  if they  do \nnot  contain  content  that  a  user  would  ordinarily  keep  there. \n27.  While  GARTENLAUB  was  navigating  to  this  folder \nlocation,  he  highlighted  a  number  of  files,  such  as  \"Deflowered \nTeenagers,\"  \"Deflowered  Teenagers  2,\"  and  \"Deflowered  Teenagers \n3,\"  and  files  with  \"Defloration\"  in  their  titles.  Although \nthese  files  did  not  appear  to  be  child pornography,  it shows \nthat  GARTENLAUB  continued  to  organize  and  manage  the  files  on \nhis  computer  that  contained pornographic  or  other  obscene \ncontent  and  that  he  did  so  within  the  reticulate  folder \nstructure  he  had  created. \n16 \n\nCase 8:14-cr-00173-CAS   Document 1   Filed 08/27/14   Page 18 of 19   Page ID #:18\n3.  GARTENLAUB's  Organization  of Child and Adult \nPornography \n28.  In  my  review  of  the  contents  of  these  three  hard \ndrives,  I  saw  that  while  some  folders  contained  child \npornography  videos  that  corresponded  to  the  names  of  the  folders \nwhere  they  were  stored,  some  folders  contained  adult  pornography \nor  other  obscene  content  that  were  also  organized  according  to \ncontent  and  stored  in  folders  with  corresponding  names.  Based \non  the  fact  that  the  child pornography  had  been  organized  into \nfolders  based  on  its  content,  I  believe  that  GARTENLAUB \norganized  the  child pornography  and  knowingly  possessed  it. \n29.  For  example,  some  of  the  child pornography  files \ndescribed  above  that  contained  the  name  \"Vicky\"  in  the  file  name \nwere  stored  in  a  folder  labeled  \"vi,\"  the  first  two  letters  of \nthe  name.  Similarly,  some  of  the  child pornography  files  that \ndepicted  girls  engaged  in  sexually  explicit  conduct  were  saved \nin  a  folder  labeled  \"yg,\"  which  may  be  shorthand  for  \"young \ngirls.\" \n30.  Likewise,  GARTENLAUB  also  stored  adult  pornography  and \nother  obscene  content  in  folders  with  names  that  corresponded  to \nthe  content.  For  example,  video  files  depicting  anal  sex  were \nsaved  in  a  folder  labeled  \"anl.\"  Similarly,  one  video  file \nlabeled  \"Hustler  Barely  Legal  School  Gym  Orgy.mpg,\"  and  another \nlabeled \"Lily(barely  legal) .mpg\"  were  saved  in  a  folder  labeled \n\"BL,\"  which  may  be  an  abbreviation  for  \"barely  legal.\" \n31.  This  shows  that  GARTENLAUB  likely  reviewed  the  child \npornography  videos  and  was  familiar  with  their  content  such  that \n17 \n\nCase 8:14-cr-00173-CAS   Document 1   Filed 08/27/14   Page 19 of 19   Page ID #:19\nhe  was  able  to  put  the  files  into  folders  whose  names \ncorresponded  to  their  content.  GARTENLAUB's  computers  stored \nand  organized  both  files  that  did  contain  child pornography  and \nfiles  that  did  not  contain  child pornography  (but  which  had \nnames  suggesting  they  were  child  pornography)  according  to  their \ncontents. \nIV.  CONCLUSION \n32.  Based  on  the  foregoing,  I  submit  that  there  is \nprobable  cause  to  believe  that  GARTENLAUB  has  violated Title. 18, \nUnited  States  Code,  Section  2252A(a) (5) (B)  by  knowingly \npossessing  child pornography. \n~~PER, \n.r \nKENNETH  F  Special  Agent \nFederal  Bureau  of  Investigation \nSubscribed  to  and  sworn  before  me \nThis~ day  of  August,  2014. \nJay C.

There was sufficient evidence to sustain Gartenlaub’s conviction for \nknowing possession of child pornography.  Viewing the evidence in the light most \nfavorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the \nessential elements of the crime—including knowledge—beyond a reasonable \ndoubt.  The government presented sufficient evidence that Gartenlaub knew the \nchild pornography was present on his computers.  See 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B) \n(requiring that the defendant must “knowingly possess[] . . . any . . . computer disk, \nor any other material that contains an image of child pornography that has been . . . \ntransported using any means or facility of interstate or foreign commerce . . . \nincluding by computer”). \nThe government demonstrated that an individual intentionally downloaded \nchild pornography, copied it onto Gartenlaub’s hard drives, and organized and \nreorganized the child pornography into folders reflecting the content of the videos.  \nSee 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B).  A rational jury could have concluded beyond a \nreasonable doubt that the user of the password-protected “Keith” account opened a \nfolder containing obviously child-pornographic filenames and then copied those \nfiles onto a new computer, that “Keith” knowingly downloaded and organized the \nchild pornography collection in the first place, and that “Keith” was Keith \n                                           \n1 The government’s motion to file an oversized brief, Dkt 51, is GRANTED. \n2 \n      \n\nCase 8:14-cr-00173-CAS   Document 250   Filed 10/02/18   Page 3 of 5   Page ID #:3942\nGartenlaub himself.  See United States v. Nevils, 598 F.3d 1158, 1164 (9th Cir. \n2010) (en banc); United States v. Willard, 230 F.3d 1093, 1095 (9th Cir. 2000) \n(citing Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979)). \n2.  The district court did not commit plain error by failing to suppress the \nevidence from Gartenlaub’s computer as inadmissible for violating the Fourth \nAmendment.2  \nNo controlling authority dictates the conclusion that the government’s \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act (“FISA”) search and subsequent use of \nFISA-derived materials in a non-national security prosecution violates the Fourth \nAmendment, such that the district court’s failure to follow it was plain error.  See \nUnited States v. Gonzalez-Aparicio, 663 F.3d 419, 428 (9th Cir. 2011), as amended \n(Nov. 16, 2011).  Our decision in United States v. Comprehensive Drug Testing, \nInc., 621 F.3d 1162 (9th Cir. 2010) (en banc), abrogation recognized by Demaree \nv. Pederson, 887 F.3d 870 (9th Cir. 2018) (per curiam), is inapposite; it did not \ndecide the question presented by this case and, in fact, addressed no national \nsecurity concerns particular to the FISA context.   \nThe idea that the government can decide that someone is a foreign agent \nbased on secret information; on that basis obtain computers containing “[t]he sum \n                                           \n2   Plain error review is the appropriate standard because Gartenlaub did not \nassert the Fourth Amendment argument predicated on alleged misuse of the FISA \nwarrant before the district court. \n3 \n      \n\nCase 8:14-cr-00173-CAS   Document 250   Filed 10/02/18   Page 4 of 5   Page ID #:3943\nof [that] individual’s private life,” Riley v. California, 134 S. Ct. 2473, 2489 \n(2014); and then prosecute that individual for completely unrelated crimes \ndiscovered as a result of rummaging through that computer comes perilously close \nto the exact abuses against which the Fourth Amendment was designed to protect.3  \nHowever, the district court did not commit plain error by concluding otherwise.   \n3.  Based upon our independent review of the classified record evidence, we \nconclude that the FISA warrant was supported by probable cause. The FISA \napplication and supporting materials demonstrated probable cause to believe that \nGartenlaub was an agent of a foreign power when the FISA order was issued.  See \n50 U.S.C. §§ 1801(b), 1821(1), 1824(a)(2).4 The district court did not err in \ndenying Gartenlaub a Franks hearing.  The district court did not err in “finding that \nthe government did not intentionally or recklessly make false statements.” United \nStates v. Christie, 825 F.3d 1048, 1069 (9th Cir. 2016) (citation omitted); see \nFranks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978).   \n                                           \n3   We thank amici curiae, Electronic Frontier Foundation and American Civil \nLiberties Union, for their thought-provoking briefing. \n4   Although there is a split in the circuits as to what deference to afford a \ndistrict court’s determination that a FISA order was based on probable cause, we \ndo not resolve here which level of deference is appropriate as we are convinced \nprobable cause existed under either a de novo or an abuse of discretion standard of \nreview. See United States v. Turner, 840 F.3d 336, 340 (7th Cir. 2016) (applying a \nde novo standard of review); United States v. Hassan, 742 F.3d 104, 139 n.29 (4th \nCir. 2014) (noting that the Fourth Circuit applies a de novo standard although the \nFifth and Second Circuits apply a more deferential standard). \n4 \n      \n\nCase 8:14-cr-00173-CAS   Document 250   Filed 10/02/18   Page 5 of 5   Page ID #:3944\n4.  We have conducted an in camera review of the underlying FISA \nmaterials. We conclude that the disclosure of the FISA materials to Gartenlaub was \nnot “necessary to make an accurate determination of the legality of the search.”  50 \nU.S.C. § 1825(g); see also United States v. Ott, 827 F.2d 473, 476–77 (9th Cir. \n1987) (finding “no indications of possible misrepresentation of fact, vague \nidentification of the persons to be surveilled, or surveillance records which include \na significant amount of non-foreign intelligence information, or any other factors \nthat would indicate a need for disclosure” (internal quotation marks omitted)).  In \npoint of fact, disclosure was not necessary even under a less rigorous standard than \nthat proposed by the government.  As well, the non-disclosure violated neither \nGartenlaub’s due process nor Brady rights.  See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 \n(1963); Ott, 827 F.2d at 476–77. \nAFFIRMED. \n5 \n      ",

BACKGROUND \n12 \n[CLASSIFIED  MATERIAL  REDACTED] \n13 \nOn  August  27,  2014,  pursuant  to  50  U.S.C.  §§  1806(c)  and \n14 \n1825(d),  the  United  States  provided  notice  to  the  defendant  that  it \n15 \n\"intends  to  offer  into  evidence,  or  otherwise  use  or  disclose  in  any \n16 \n17  proceedings  in  the  above-captioned matter,  information  obtained  or \n18  derived  from  electronic  surveillance  and  physical  search  conducted \n19  pursuant  to  the  Foreign  Intelligence  Surveillance Act  of  1978  (FISA), \n20 \nas  amended,  50  U.S.C.  §§  1801-1812  and  1821-1829.n  Doc.  9.  On \n21 \nFebruary  2,  2015,  the  defendant  filed,  under  seal,  his motion  which \n22 \nseeks,  among  other  things,  disclosure  of  the  FISA  materials  and \n23 \nsuppression  of  the  FISA  information.

OVERVIEW  OF  FISA \n3 \nEnacted  in  1978,  and  subsequently  amended,  FISA  authorizes  the \n4 \nChief  Justice  of  the  United  States  to  designate  eleven  United  States \n5 \nDistrict  Judges  to  sit as  judges  of  the  FISC.  50  u.s.c. \n6 \n§  1803 (a) (1).  The  FISC  judges  are  empowered  to  consider  ex  parte \n7 \napplications  submitted  by  the  Executive  Branch  for  electronic \n8 \n9  surveillance  and  physical  searches  when  a  significant  purpose  of  the \n10  application  is  to  obtain  foreign  intelligence  information,  as  defined \n11 \nin  FISA.  Rulings  of  the  FISC  are  subject  to  review  by  the  Foreign \n12 \nIntelligence  Surveillance  Court  of  Review  (FISC  of  Review),  which  is \n13 \ncomposed  of  three  United  States  District  or  Circuit  Judges  who  are \n14 \ndesignated by  the  Chief  Justice.  50  u.s.c.  §  1803(b). \n15 \nAs  originally enacted,  FISA  required  that  a  high-ranking  member \n16 \n17  of  the  Executive  Branch  of  Government  certify that  \"the  purpose\"  of \n18  the  FISA  application was  to  obtain  foreign  intelligence  information. \n19  In  2001,  FISA  was  amended  as  part  of  the  Uniting  and  Strengthening \n20 \nAmerica  by  Providing  Appropriate  Tools  Required  to  Intercept  and \n21 \nObstruct  Terrorism Act  (\"USA  PATRIOT  Act\"). 5  One  change  to  FISA \n22 \naccomplished  by  the  USA  PATRIOT  Act  is  that  a  high-ranking  official \n23 \nis  now  required  to  certify that  the  acquisition  of  foreign \n24 \nintelligence  information  is  \"a  significant  purpose\"  of  the  requested \n25 \n26  surveillance.  50  U.S.C.  §  1804(a) (6) (B). \n27 \n5  Pub.

Standard  of Review \n14 \nIn  evaluating  the  legality of  the  FISA  collection,  the  district \n15 \ncourt's  review  should  determine:  (1)  whether  the  certification \n16 \n17  submitted  by  the  Executive  Branch  in  support  of  a  FISA  application \n18  was  properly made;  (2)  whether  the  application  established  the \n19  probable  cause  required  by  FISA;  and  (3)  whether  the  collection  was \n20 \nproperly minimized.  See  Abu-Jihaad  II,  630  F.3d  at  130-31.  See  also \n21 \n50  u.s.c.  §§  1806(f),  1825(g). \n22 \nAlthough  federal  courts  are  not  in  agreement  as  to  whether  the \n23 \nprobable  cause  determinations  of  the  FISC  should  be  reviewed  de  novo \n24 \nor  accorded  due  deference,  the  material  under  review  here  satisfies \n25 \n26  either  standard  of  review.

See,  e.g.,  United  States  v.  Krupa,  658  F.3d  1174, \n19 \n17  See,  e.g.,  Kabir,  Doc.

It \n7 \nwould  thus  be  consistent  for  a  court  that  is  reviewing  FISC-approved \n8 \n9  electronic  surveillance  and  physical  searches  to  adopt  the  same \n10  posture  it would  when  reviewing  the  probable  cause  determination  of  a \n11 \ncriminal  search  warrant  issued  pursuant  to  Rule  41  of  the  Federal \n12 \nRules  of  Criminal  Procedure.

As  discussed  below,  notwithstanding  the  speculation by \n16 \nthe  defense,  there  is no  basis  to  find  that  any  declarations  or \n17 \ncertifications  at  issue  in  this  case  were  deliberately  or  recklessly \n18 \nfalse.

Further,  there  are  no  facts  indicating \n22  that  the  FISC  failed  to  act  in  a  neutral  and  detached  manner  in \n23  authorizing  the  surveillance  and  searches  at  issue.  Leon,  468  U.S. \n24 \nat  914-15.  Moreover,  as  the  Court  will  see  from  its  in  camera,  ex \n25 \nparte  review  of  the  FISA  materials,  facts  establishing  the  requisite \n26 \nprobable  cause  were  submitted  to  the  FISC,  the  FISC's  orders \n27 \ncontained  all  of  the  requisite  findings,  and  \"well-trained officers\" \n28 \n31 \n\nCase 8:14-cr-00173-CAS   Document 82   Filed 05/04/15   Page 43 of 67   Page ID #:687\n1  reasonably  relied on  those  orders.

That  is,  the  FISA-obtained  or \n22  -derived  information  that  will  be  offered  into  evidence  in  this  case \n23  was  acquired,  retained,  and  disseminated  by  the  FBI  in  accordance \n24 \nwith  FISA's  minimization  requirements,  the  standard minimization \n25 \nprocedures  (\"SMPs\")  adopted  by  the  Attorney  General  and  approved  by \n26 \nthe  FISC,  and  all  relevant  FISC  orders. \n27 \n28 \n33 \n\nCase 8:14-cr-00173-CAS   Document 82   Filed 05/04/15   Page 45 of 67   Page ID #:689\n1  1.  The  Standard Minimization  Procedures \n2  Once  a  reviewing  court  is  satisfied that  the  electronic \n3 \nsurveillance  or  physical  searches  were  properly  certified and  the \n4 \ninformation  was  lawfully  acquired  pursuant  to  FISA,  it must  then \n5 \nexamine  whether  the  electronic  surveillance  or  physical  searches  were \n6 \nlawfully  conducted.  See  50  U.S.C.  §§  1806 (e) (2),  1825 (f) (1)  (B).  In \n7 \norder  to  examine  whether  the  electronic  surveillance  or  physical \n8 \n9  searches  were  lawfully  conducted,  the  reviewing  court  must  determine \n10  whether  the  Government  followed  the  relevant  minimization  procedures \n11 \nto  appropriately minimize  the  information  acquired  pursuant  to  FISA. \n12 \n[CLASSIFIED  MATERIAL  REDACTED] \n13 \nFISA's  legislative history  and  the  applicable  case  law \n14 \ndemonstrate  that  the  definitions  of  \"minimization  procedures\"  and \n15 \n\"foreign  intelligence  information\"  were  intended  to  take  into  account \n16 \n17  the  realities  of  collecting  foreign  intelligence,  because  the \n18  activities  of  persons  engaged  in  clandestine  intelligence  gathering \n19  or  international  terrorism  are  often  not  obvious  on  their  face.  See \n20 \nRahman,  861  F.  Supp.  at  252-53.  The  degree  to  which  information  is \n21 \nrequired  to  be  minimized  varies  somewhat  given  the  specifics  of  a \n22 \nparticular  investigation,  such  that  less  minimization  at  acquisition \n23 \nis  justified when  \"the  investigation  is  focusing  on  what  is  thought \n24 \nto  be  a  widespread  conspiracy\"  and  more  extensive  surveillance  is \n25 \n26  necessary  \"to  determine  the  precise  scope  of  the  enterprise.\"  In  re \n27  Sealed  Case,  310  F.3d  at  741;  see  also  United  States  v.

Furthermore,  the  activities  of  foreign  powers  and  their \n5 \nagents  are  often  not  obvious  from  an  initial  or  cursory  overhear  of \n6 \nconversations.  To  the  contrary,  agents  of  foreign  powers  frequently \n7 \nengage  in  coded  communications,  compartmentalized  operations,  the  use \n8 \n9  of  false  identities  and  other  practices  designed  to  conceal  the \n10  breadth  and  aim  of  their operations,  organization,  activities  and \n11 \nplans.  See,  e.g.,  United  States  v.

As \n15 \none  court  explained,  \"[i]nnocuous-sounding  conversations  may  in  fact \n16 \n17  be  signals  of  important  activity;  information  on  its  face  innocent \n18  when  analyzed  or  considered with  other  information may  become \n19  critical.\"  Kevork,  634  F.

Mubayyid,  521 \n5 \nF.  Supp.  2d  at  134;  Rahman,  861  F.  Supp.  at  252.  As  a  result, \n6 \n\"courts  have  construed  'foreign  intelligence  information'  broadly  and \n7 \nsensibly  allowed  the  government  some  latitude  in  its determination  of \n8 \n9  what  is  foreign  intelligence  information.\"  Rosen,  447  F.  Supp.  2d  at \n10  551. \n11 \nThe  nature  of  the  foreign  intelligence  information  sought  also \n12 \nimpacts  implementation  of  the  minimization  procedures  at  the \n13 \nretention  and  dissemination  stages.  There  is  a  legitimate  need  to \n14 \nconduct  a  thorough  post-acquisition  review  of  FISA  information  that \n15 \ninvolves  a  United  States  person  who  is  acting  as  an  agent  of  a \n16 \n17  foreign  power.  As  Congress  explained: \n18  It is  \"necessary\"  to  identify anyone  working  with  him \nin  this  network,  feeding  him  information,  or  to  whom \n19  he  reports.  Therefore,  it is necessary  to  acquire, \nretain  and  disseminate  information  concerning  all his \n20 \ncontacts  and  acquaintances  and  his  movements.  Among \n21  his  contacts  and  acquaintances,  however,  there  are \nlikely  to  be  a  large  number  of  innocent  persons.  Yet, \n22  information  concerning  these  persons  must  be  retained \nat  least  until  it is  determined  that  they  are  not \n23  involved  in  the  clandestine  intelligence  activities \nand  may  have  to  be  disseminated  in  order  to  determine \n24 \ntheir  innocence. \n25 \nHouse  Report,  part  1,  at  58.  Indeed,  at  least  one  court  has \n26 \ncautioned  that,  when  a  U.S.  person  communicates  with  an  agent  of  a \n27 \nforeign  power,  the  Government  would  be  \"remiss  in meeting  its  foreign \n28 \n36 \n\nCase 8:14-cr-00173-CAS   Document 82   Filed 05/04/15   Page 48 of 67   Page ID #:692\n1  counterintelligence  responsibilities\"  if it did  not  thoroughly \n2 \n\"investigate  such  contacts  and  gather  information  to  determine  the \n3 \nnature  of  those  activities.\"  Thomson,  752  F.  Supp.  at  82. \n4 \nCongress  also  recognized  that  agents  of  a  foreign  power  are \n5 \noften  very  sophisticated  and  skilled at  hiding  their activities.  Cf. \n6 \nThomson,  752  F.  Supp.  at  81  (quoting  House  Report  part  1,  at  58). \n7 \nAccordingly,  to  pursue  leads,  Congress  intended  that  the  Government \n8 \n9  be  given  \"a  significant  degree  of  latitude\"  with  respect  to  the \n10  \"retention  of  information  and  the  dissemination  of  information \n11 \nbetween  and  among  counterintelligence  components  of  the  Government.\" \n12 \nCf.  Id. \n13 \nIn  light  of  these  realities,  Congress  recognized  that  \"no \n14 \nelectronic  surveillance  can  be  so  conducted  that  innocent \n15 \nconversations  can  be  totally eliminated.\"  See  S.  Rep.  No.  95-701, \n16 \n17  95th  Cong.,  2d  Sess.,  39  (quoting  Keith,  407  U.S.  at  323)  (1978) \n18  (\"Senate  Report\") .  The  Fourth  Circuit  reached  the  same  conclusion  in \n19 \nHammoud,  stating that  the  \"mere  fact  that  innocent  conversations  were \n20 \nrecorded,  without  more,  does  not  establish  that  the  government  failed \n21 \nto  appropriately minimize  surveillance.\"  381  F.3d  at  334. \n22 \nAccordingly,  in  reviewing  the  adequacy  of  minimization  efforts, \n23 \nthe  test  to  be  applied  is  neither whether  innocent  conversations  were \n24 \nintercepted,  nor  whether  mistakes  were  made  with  respect  to \n25 \n26  particular  communications.  Rather,  as  the  United  States  Supreme \n27  Court  stated  in  the  context  of  Title  III  surveillance,  there  should \n28 \nbe  an  \"objective  assessment  of  the  [agents']  actions  in  light  of  the \n37 \n\nCase 8:14-cr-00173-CAS   Document 82   Filed 05/04/15   Page 49 of 67   Page ID #:693\n1  facts  and  circumstances  confronting  [them]  at  the  time.\"  Scott  v. \n2 \nUnited  States,  436  U.S.  128,  136  (1978).  \"The  test  of  compliance  is \n3 \n'whether  a  good-faith  effort  to  minimize  was  made.'\"  Mubayyid,  521 \n4 \nF.

As  a  result,  to  the  extent \n20 \nthat  certain  communications  of  a  United  States  person  may  be  evidence \n21 \nof  a  crime  or  otherwise  may  establish  an  element  of  a  substantive  or \n22 \nconspiratorial  offense,  such  communications  need  not  be  minimized. \n23 \nSee  Id.  at  1305. \n24 \nEven  assuming,  arguendo,  that  certain  communications  were  not \n25 \n26  properly minimized,  suppression  would  not  be  the  appropriate  remedy \n27  with  respect  to  those  communications  that  met  the  standard.  Cf. \n28 \nUnited  States  v.  Falcone,  364  F.

As  discussed  above, \n2 \nabsent  evidence  that  \"on  the  whole\"  there  has  been  a  \"complete\" \n3 \ndisregard  for  the  minimization  procedures,  the  fact  that  some \n4 \ncommunications  should  have  been  minimized  does  not  affect  the \n5 \nadmissibility  of  others  that  were  properly  acquired  and  retained. \n6 \nIndeed,  Congress  specifically  intended  that  the  only  evidence  that \n7 \nshould  be  suppressed  is  the  \"evidence  which  was  obtained  unlawfully.\" \n8 \n9  House  Report  at  93.  FISA's  legislative history  reflects  that \n10  Congress  intended  only  a  limited  sanction  for  errors  of  minimization: \n11 \nAs  the  language  of  the  bill makes  clear,  only  that \nevidence  which  was  obtained  unlawfully  or  derived  from \n12 \ninformation  obtained  unlawfully  would  be  suppressed. \n13  If,  for  example,  some  information  should  have  been \nminimized  but  was  not,  only  that  information  should  be \n14  suppressed;  the  other  information  obtained  lawfully \nshould  not  be  suppressed. \n15 \nId.;  see  also  Falcone,  364  F.

[CLASSIFIED  MATERIAL  REDACTED] \n3 \n[CLASSIFIED  MATERIAL  REDACTED] \n4 \nV.  THE  COURT  SHOULD  REJECT  THE  DEFENDANT'S  LEGAL  ARGUMENTS \n5 \nIn  his  motion,  the  defendant  makes  several  constitutional  claims \n6 \nand  requests  that  the  Court:  \"1)  review  all  FISA  applications  and \n7 \nwarrants,  2)  order  disclosure  of  the  documents  to  defense  counsel,  3) \n8 \n9  conduct  an  evidentiary  hearing  pursuant  to  Franks ... ,  and  4)  as  a \n10  result,  suppress  all  FISA  intercepts  and  seizures  and  any  fruits \n11  derived  therefrom. ''\"9  Doc.  70  at  p.  28.  For  the  reasons  set  forth \n12 \nbelow,  the  Court  should  reject  the  defendant's  arguments. \n13 \nA.  THE  DEFENDANT'S  CONSTITUTIONAL  ARGUMENTS  LACK  MERIT \n14 \nThe  defendant  raises  a  number  of  constitutional  challenges, \n15 \nunder  the  First,  Fourth,  Fifth,  and  Sixth Amendments,  that  have \n16 \nrepeatedly  been  rejected  by  other  courts. 20  These  arguments  lack \n17 \n18  merit,  and  the  Government  will  respond  to  each  below. \n19 \n19  The  defendant  argues  for  de  novo  review  by  this  Court  of  the  FISA \n20  materials,  or  even  a  review  \"more  exacting  than  the  FISC's  review,\" \nDoc.  70  at  p.  15,  a  position  that  has  no  basis  in  the  law.  However, \n21  the  Government  respectfully  submits  that  the  Court  will  find  that  the \nFISA-authorized  electronic  surveillance  and  physical  searches  were \n22 \nlegally authorized  and  the  FISA  information  was  lawfully  acquired, \nunder  either de  novo  review  or  a  due  deference  review. \n23 \n20  The  defendant  also  suggests,  without  further  explanation,  that  the \n24 \nGovernment's  actions  may  have  been  in violation  of  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment,  Doc.  70  at  p.  3,  which  \"applies  to  actions  by  a  State.\" \n25 \nSan  Francisco Arts  & Athletics,  Inc.,  v.  United  States  Olympic \n26  Committee,  483  U.S.  522,  542  n.  21  (1987).  The  defendant  does  not \nallege  any  State  action. \n27 \nThe  defendant  references  the  FISA  Amendments  Act  of  2008  and \n28  \"several  controversial  programs,  such  as  Prism  and  Upstream,\"  and \n(footnote  cont'd on  next page) \n40 \n\nCase 8:14-cr-00173-CAS   Document 82   Filed 05/04/15   Page 52 of 67   Page ID #:696\n1  1.  The  FISA Applications Were  Not  Based  Solely on \nProtected First Amendment  Activity \n2 \n[CLASSIFIED  MATERIAL  REDACTED] \n3 \n2.  The  Probable  Cause  Standard of FISA  Complies  with \n4 \nthe  Fourth Amendment's  Reasonableness  Requirement \n5 \nThe  defendant  argues  that  he  \"has  a  right  to  a  determination  as \n6 \nto  whether  the  most  invasive  of  intrusions  into  his  home  violated  the \n7 \nFourth  Amendment.\"  Doc.  70  at  p.  24.  Again,  the  defendant  merely \n8 \n9  concludes,  without  factual  support,  that  the  Government  \"may  have \n10  violated\"  the  Fourth  Amendment.  Id.  at  p.  3  (emphasis  added).  The \n11 \nprobable  cause  threshold  that  the  Government  must  satisfy before \n12 \nreceiving  authorization  to  conduct  electronic  surveillance  or \n13 \nphysical  searches  under  FISA  complies  with  the  Fourth  Amendment's \n14 \nreasonableness  standard.  The  Supreme  Court  has  stated  that \n15 \n\"[d]ifferent  standards  may  be  compatible  with  the  Fourth  Amendment  if \n16 \n17  they  are  reasonable  both  in  relation  to  the  legitimate  need  of  the \n18  Government  for  intelligence  information  and  the  protected  rights  of \n19  our  citizens.\"  Keith,  407  U.S.  at  322-23  (recognizing  that  domestic \n20 \nsecurity  surveillance  \"may  involve  different  policy  and  practical \n21 \nconsiderations  than  the  surveillance  of  'ordinary  crime'\").  In \n22 \nKeith,  the  Supreme  Court  acknowledged  that:  (1)  the  \"focus  of  . \n23 \nsurveillance  (in  domestic  security  investigations]  may  be  less \n24 \nprecise  than  that  directed against  more  conventional  types  of  crime\"; \n25 \n26  (2)  unlike  ordinary  criminal  investigations,  \"[t]he  gathering  of \n27 \nthen  concedes  that  they  are  not  at  issue  in  this  case.

Id.  Although  Keith  was  decided before  FISA's  enactment \n6 \nand  addressed  purely  domestic  security  surveillance,  the  rationale \n7 \nunderlying  Keith  applies  ~ fortiori  to  foreign  intelligence \n8 \n9  surveillance,  where  the  Government's  interest,  at  least  from  a \n10  national  security perspective,  would  typically be  more  pronounced. \n11  FISA  was  enacted  partly in  response  to  Keith.  In  constructing \n12 \nFISA's  framework,  Congress  addressed  Keith's  question  of  whether \n13 \ndepartures  from  traditional  Fourth  Amendment  procedures  \"are \n14 \nreasonable,  both  in  relation  to  the  legitimate  need  of  Government  for \n15 \nintelligence  information  and  the  protected  rights  of  our  citizens,\" \n16 \n17  and  \"concluded  that  such  departures  are  reasonable.\"  See  Senate \n18  Report  at  11.  Similarly,  many  courts  - including  the  Ninth  Circuit \n19  and  the  FISC  of  Review  - have  relied  on  Keith  in  holding  that  FISA \n20 \ncollection  conducted  pursuant  to  a  FISC  order  is  reasonable  under  the \n21 \nFourth  Amendment.  See  Cavanagh,  807  F.2d  at  790-91  (holding  that \n22 \nFISA  satisfies  the  Fourth  Amendment  requirements  of  probable  cause \n23 \nand  particularity);  In  reSealed  Case,  310  F.3d  at  738,  746  (finding \n24 \nthat  while  many  of  FISA's  requirements  differ  from  those  in  Title \n25 \n26  III,  few  of  those  differences  have  constitutional  relevance);  Duggan, \n27  743  F.2d  at  74  (holding  that  FISA  does  not  violate  the  Fourth \n28 \nAmendment);  see  also  Ning  Wen,  477  F. 3d  at  898  (holding  that  FISA  is \n42 \n\nCase 8:14-cr-00173-CAS   Document 82   Filed 05/04/15   Page 54 of 67   Page ID #:698\n1  constitutional  despite  using  \"a  definition  of  'probable  cause'  that \n2  does  not  depend  on  whether  a  domestic  crime  has  been  committed\"); \n3 \nDamrah,  412  F.3d  at  625  (denying  the  defendant's  claim  that  FISA's \n4 \nprocedures  violate  the  Fourth  Amendment);  Pelton,  835  F.2d  at  1075 \n5 \n(finding  FISA's  procedures  compatible  with  the  Fourth  Amendment); \n6 \nWarsame,  547  F.

Supp.  2d  at \n10  135-41  (rejecting  claim  that  FISA  violates  the  Fourth  Amendment's \n11  judicial  review,  probable  cause,  notice,  and  particularity \n12 \nrequirements);  Falvey,  540  F.  Supp.  at  1311-14  (finding  that  FISA \n13 \nprocedures  satisfy the  Fourth  Amendment's  warrant  requirement). \n14 \n3.  The  Court's  In  Camera  and Ex  Parte  Review  Comports  with \n15  the  Fifth Amendment's  Due  Process  and  the  Sixth \nAmendment's  Counsel  and  Confrontation  Clauses \n16 \nThe  defendant  states  that  \"[u]nder  the  Fifth Amendment's  Due \n17 \n18  Process  Clause,  defendants  must  be  afforded  a  process  that  permits \n19  them  to  seek  the  suppression  remedy,\"  Doc.  70  at  p.  24,  but  fails  to \n20 \nexplain  how  he  has  been  denied  that  remedy  here,  where  FISA  expressly \n21 \nprovides  a  statutory  suppression  remedy,  50  U.S.C.  §§  1806(e), \n22 \n1825(f),  of  which  he  has  availed  himself  by  filing  this  motion. \n23 \nCiting  to  authorities  that  did  not  address  FISA,  the  defendant \n24 \nfurther  argues  that  \"[t]he  Court's  review  in  camera  is  not  a \n25 \n26  substitute  for  the  defense  counsel's  participation,\"  and  that  without \n27  such  participation  he  \"is  not  receiving  the  Sixth Amendment \n28 \nconstitutional  benefit  of  adequate  representation  of  counsel.\"  Doc. \n43 \n\nCase 8:14-cr-00173-CAS   Document 82   Filed 05/04/15   Page 55 of 67   Page ID #:699\n1  70  at  p.  27.  Accordingly,  the  defendant  claims,  under  the  \"Sixth \n2 \nAmendment  and/or  the  Due  Process  clause,  disclosure  of  the  FISA \n3 \nmaterials  is  authorized  and  appropriate  in  this  case.\"  Id. \n4 \nSeveral  District  Courts  in  the  Ninth  Circuit  have  addressed  the \n5 \nright  to  confrontation  in  this  context  and  found  that  \"FISA's  in \n6 \ncamera  review  provisions  have  been  held  to  be  constitutional.\" \n7 \nNicholson,  2010  U.S.  Dist.  LEXIS  45126,  citing  Isa,  923  F.2d  at  1037-\n8 \n9  08  (Sixth  Amendment  right  of  confrontation  is  not  violated by  FISA's \n10  in  camera  review  procedure);  see  also  United  States  v.

Supp.  2d  at  988  n.4 \n22 \n(finding  argument  \"without  merit\"  and  citing  to  Nicholson,  955  F. \n23 \nSupp.  at  592).  Other  courts  have  also  consistently  rejected the \n24 \nSixth  Amendment  argument.  See  Belfield,  692  F.2d  at  148  (rejecting \n25 \n26  Sixth Amendment  challenge);  Isa,  923  F.2d  at  1306-07  (rejecting  Sixth \n27  Amendment  challenge);  Megahey,  553  F.

Supp.  2d  at  554  (rejecting \n44 \n\nCase 8:14-cr-00173-CAS   Document 82   Filed 05/04/15   Page 56 of 67   Page ID #:700\n1  Sixth Amendment  right  to  counsel  challenge);  Falvey,  540  F.  Supp.  at \n2  1315-16  (rejecting  First,  Fifth,  and  Sixth Amendment  challenges  and \n3 \nnoting  that  a  \"massive  body  of  pre-FISA  case  law  of  the  Supreme \n4 \nCourt,  [the  Second]  Circuit  and  others\"  supports  the  conclusion  that \n5 \nthe  legality of  electronic  surveillance  should  be  determined  on  an  in \n6 \ncamera,  ex  parte  basis).  In  overturning  a  district  court's  order  to \n7 \ndisclose  FISA  materials  to  the  defense,  the  Daoud  court  described  the \n8 \n9  belief  that  \"adversary  procedure  is  always  essential  to  resolve \n10  contested  issues  of  fact\"  as  \"an  incomplete  description  of  the \n11  American  legal  system  in  general  and  the  federal  judicial  system  in \n12 \nparticular.\"  755  F.3d  at  482. \n13 \nB.  THE  DEFENDANT  HAS  NOT  ESTABLISHED  ANY  BASIS  TO  DISCLOSE \n14  THE  FISA MATERIALS \n15  In  support  of  his  argument  to  disclose  the  FISA  materials,  the \n16 \ndefendant  asserts  that:  (1)  there  is  \"a  significant  question  about \n17 \nwhether  any  need  for  secrecy persists\"  with  regard  to  the  FISA \n18 \nmaterials  (Doc.  70  at  p.  12);  and  (2)  the  affiant  in  the  FISA \n19 \nmaterials  \"intentionally  or  recklessly made  materially  false \n20 \n21  statements  and/or  omitted material  information  ... \"21  Doc.  70  at  p. \n22  14.  On  these  bases,  the  defendant  seeks  the  disclosure  of  classified \n23  FISA  materials,  which  are  protected  from  such  disclosure,  except  as \n24 \nprovided  in  50  U.S.C.  §§  1806(f)-(g)  and  l825(g)-(h).  As  discussed \n25 \nbelow,  Congress's  clear  intention  is  that  FISA  materials  should  be \n26 \n27 \n21  [CLASSIFIED  MATERIAL  REDACTED] \n28 \n45 \n\nCase 8:14-cr-00173-CAS   Document 82   Filed 05/04/15   Page 57 of 67   Page ID #:701\n1  reviewed  in  camera  and  ex  parte  and  in  a  manner  consistent  with  the \n2  realities  of  modern  intelligence  needs  and  investigative  techniques. \n3 \nIndeed,  this  Court  will  find  upon  its own  review  that  there  is \n4 \nnothing  extraordinary  about  this  case  that  would  prompt  this  Court  to \n5 \norder  the  disclosure  of  highly  sensitive  and  classified  FISA \n6 \nmaterials  and  that  the  defendant  has  failed  to  present  any  colorable \n7 \nbasis  for  the  Court  to  order  disclosure  of  the  FISA  materials. \n8 \n9  There  is only  one  reason  to  disclose  the  FISA  materials  to \n10  defense  counsel.  The  Court  must  conduct  its  review  of  those \n11 \nmaterials  in  camera  and  ex  parte,  and  disclosure  is  within  the \n12 \nCourt's  discretion  only  following  that  review  and  only  if the  Court \n13 \nis  unable  to  determine  the  legality of  the  electronic  surveillance, \n14 \nphysical  searches,  or  both,  without  the  assistance  of  defense \n15 \ncounsel.  50  u. s . c.  §§  18 0 6 (f) '  18 2 5 (g) .  Duggan,  743  F.2d  at  78;  see \n16 \n17  also  Daoud,  755  F.3d  at  482.  Duggan's  holding  is  fully  supported  by \n18  the  legislative  history of  Section  1806(f)  of  FISA,  which  states: \n19  \"The  court  may  order  disclosure  to  [the  defense]  only  if it finds \n20 \nthat  such  disclosure  is  necessary  to  make  an  accurate  determination \n21 \nof  the  legality of  the  surveillance  ... Once  a  judicial \n22 \ndetermination  is made  that  the  surveillance  was  lawful,  a  motion  for \n23 \ndiscovery  ... must  be  denied.\"  Senate  Report  at  64-65. \n24 \n2 The  defendant  seeks  the  \"opportunity to  prove  that  the  affiant \n5 \n26  intentionally or  recklessly made  materially  false  statements  and/or \n27  omitted material  information  from  the  FISA  applications.\"  Doc.  70  at \n28 \np.  14.

In  Medunjanin,  the  court  noted  that  \"[d]efense  counsel \n3 \nmay  not  inspect  the  FISA  dockets  to  construct  a  better argument \n4 \nfor  inspecting  the  FISA  dockets.  Such  a  circular  exercise  would  be \n5 \npatently  inconsistent  with  FISA  .  2012  WL  526428  at  *10.  See \n6 \nBadia,  827  F.2d  at  1462  (rejecting  the  defendant's  request  for \n7 \n\"disclosure  of  the  FISA  application,  ostensibly  so  that  he  may  review \n8 \n9  it for  errors\"). \n10  The  defendant  asserts  that  disclosure  is  necessary  as  it is \n11 \n\"impossible  for  the  Court  and  government  counsel  to  review  the \n12 \npurportedly  secret  documents  and  determine  if additional  things  of \n13 \nthis  nature,  those  things  personal  to  [him],  were  correct.\"  Doc.  70 \n14 \nat  p.  27.  However,  as  this  Court  will  see  from  its  review,  the  FISA \n15 \nmaterials  are  presented  in  a  well-organized  and  straightforward \n16 \n17  manner  that  will  allow  the  Court  to make  its determination  of  the \n18  lawfulness  of  the  FISA  collection without  seeking  input  from  defense \n19  counsel.  Again,  defendant's  claim  that  the  Court  would  need \n20 \nassistance  from  defense  counsel  is merely  an  attempt  to  circumvent \n21 \nthe  clear  language  of  the  statute.  See  50  U.S.C.  §§  1806(f), \n22 \n1825(g).  As  the  Belfield court  stated:  \"Congress  was  adamant,  in \n23 \nenacting  FISA,  that  [its]  'carefully drawn  procedure[s]'  are  not  to \n24 \n2S  be  bypassed.\"  Belfield,  692  F.2d  at  146  (citing  Senate  Report  at \n26  63);  see  also  United  States  v.

In  summary,  the  defendant  is  not  entitled to  the  FISA \n14 \nmaterials  for  the  purpose  of  challenging  the  lawfulness  of  the  FISA \n15 \nauthorities  and  the  complete  record  presented  to  the  FISC  has  been \n16 \nprovided  to  this  Court  in  well-organized  and  straightforward manner, \n17 \n18  obviating  the  defendant's  claim  that  this  Court  would  not  be  able  to \n19  review  and  make  a  determination  as  to  the  legality of  the  FISA \n20 \ncollection without  the  assistance  of  defense  counsel. \n21 \n22  COURT  TO  CONDUCT  A  FRANKS  HEARING \n23  The  defendant  alleges  that  the  \"FISA  applications  likely contain \n24 \nintentional  or  reckless  material  falsehoods  or  omissions,  and \n25 \ntherefore  violate  the  Fourth  Amendment  principles  identified  in \n26 \nFranks  ... ,\"and requests  that  the  Court  conduct  a  Franks  hearing. \n27 \nDoc.  70  at  pp.  2-4.

Franks,  438  U.S.  at  171.  The \n4 \ndefendant,  however,  ignores  this  burden  and  simply  incorporates  by \n5 \nreference  his  Motion  to  Traverse  Search  Warrants  SA14-315M,  SA14-\n6 \n316M,  SA14-317M,  and  SA14-318M,  and  Request  for  Franks  Hearing  (Doc. \n7 \n73)  (hereinafter,  \"Motion  to  Traversen) .23  He  speculates  that, \n8 \n9  because  the  FISA  applications  \"presumably  present[]  much  of  the  same \n10  informationn  as  an  affidavit  supporting  one  of  the  criminal  search \n11 \nwarrants,  the  FISA  applications  must  have  contained  \"serious \n12 \nmisrepresentations  and  omissions.n  Doc.  70  at  pp.  13-14. \n13 \n[CLASSIFIED  MATERIAL  REDACTED] \n14 \nAs  noted  supra,  the  defendant  seeks  the  \"opportunity  to  prove \n15 \nthat  the  affiant  intentionally or  recklessly made  materially  false \n16 \nstatements  and/or  omitted material  information  from  the  FISA \n17 \n18  applications,n  Doc.  70  at  p.  14,  which  would  allow  him,  and \n19  defendants  in  every  case,  to  obtain  the  FISA  materials  by  merely \n20 \nalleging  some  impropriety. 24  Disclosing  FISA  materials  to  defendants \n21 \nwould. then  become  the  rule,  violating  Congress'  clear  intention,  set \n22 \n23  In  response  to  the  defendant's  challenges  to  the  criminal  search \n23  warrants,  the  Government  filed  a  Consolidated  Opposition  to \nDefendant's  Motion  to  Traverse  and  to  Quash  Search Warrant  at  the \n24 \ntime  this  response  was  filed. \n25 \n24  The  Hon.

In  Belfield,  for \n6 \nexample,  the  court  noted  that  \"Congress  was  also  aware  of  these \n7 \ndifficulties  [faced  by  defense  counsel  without  access  to  FISA \n8 \n9  materials  and)  chose  to  resolve  them  through  means  other  than \n10  mandatory  disclosure.\"  Belfield,  692  F.2d  at  148.  As  Judge \n11 \nLeinenweber  framed  the  difficulty  facing  defense  counsel: \n12 \nNevertheless,  to  challenge  the  veracity  of  the  FISA \n13  application,  Defendant  must  offer  substantial  proof \nthat  the  FISC  re~ied on  an  intentional  or  reckless \n14  misrepresentation  by  the  government  to  grant  the  FISA \norder.  The  quest  to  satisfy the  Franks  requirement \n15 \nmight  feel  like  a  wild-goose  chase,  as  Defendant  lacks \naccess  to  the  materials  that  would  provide  this  proof. \n16 \nThis  perceived  practical  impossibility  to  obtain  a \nhearing,  however,  does  not  constitute  a  legal \n17 \nimpossibility. \n18 \nKashmiri,  2010  U.S.  Dist.  LEXIS  119470,  at  *  17. \n19 \nMoreover,  courts  have  rejected  other  defendants'  attempts  to \n20 \n2 force  a  Franks  hearing  by  positing  unsupported  speculation  to \n1 \n22  challenge  the  validity of  FISC  orders,  and  this  Court  should  do  so \n23  here.  See  Abu-Jihaad,  531  F.  Supp.  2d  at  309;  Hassoun,  2007  WL \n24 \n1068127  at  *4;  Mubayyid,  521  F.  Supp.  2d  at  130-31;  Kashmiri,  2010 \n25 \nU.S.  Dist.

The \n15 \ndefendant's  failure  to make  a  threshold  showing  of  a  falsehood  in  the \n16 \n17  FISA  applications  is  fatal  to  a  Franks  motion.  For  these  reasons, \n18  the  Court  should  therefore  deny  the  defendant's  request  for  a  Franks \n19 \nhearing  and  his  request  for  disclosure  of  the  FISA  materials. \n20 \nD.  THE  DEFENDANT  HAS  NOT  ESTABLISHED  ANY  BASIS  FOR  THE \n21  COURT  TO  SUPPRESS  THE  FISA  INFORMATION \n22  The  defendant  requests  in  his  motion  that  the  Court  suppress  any \n23  evidence  obtained  or  derived  from  searches  or  surveillance  conducted \n24 \npursuant  to  FISA  (i.e.,  the  FISA  information).  Doc.  70  at  p.  4.  In \n25 \n25  The  defendant  ignores  this  balance,  claiming  that  \"the  focus  must \n26 \nnow  be  on  the  rights  of  the  defendant,  rather  than  general  interests \nof  intelligence  gathering.\"  Doc.  70  at  p.  15.  His  approach \n27 \ncontravenes  FISA,  which  was  carefully  drafted  to  take  both \n28  considerations  into  account. \n52 \n\nCase 8:14-cr-00173-CAS   Document 82   Filed 05/04/15   Page 64 of 67   Page ID #:708\n1  support  of  this  argument,  the  defendant  alleges  that  the  Government \n2  \"may\"  have  committed  various  improprieties.  Id.  at  pp.  2-3. \n3 \n[CLASSIFIED  MATERIAL  REDACTED] \n4 \nAs  the  Court  will  see  from  its  ex  parte,  in  camera  review  of  the \n5 \nFISA  materials,  the  Government  complied  with  all of  FISA's  statutory \n6 \nrequirements.  Accordingly,  the  Government  submits  that  there  is  no \n7 \nbasis  to  suppress  the  FISA  information  in  the  present  case. \n8 \n9  VI.  CONCLUSION:  THERE  IS  NO  BASIS  FOR  THE  COURT  TO  DISCLOSE  THE \nFISA MATERIALS,  TO  CONDUCT  A  FRANKS  HEARING,  OR  TO  SUPPRESS \n10  THE  FISA  INFORMATION \n11  The  defendant's  Motion  should  be  denied  in  its  entirety.  FISA's \n12 \nprovisions  for  in  camera,  ex  parte  review  comport  with  the  due \n13 \nprocess  requirements  of  the  United  States  Constitution.  See,  e.g., \n14 \nSpanjol,  720  F.  Supp.  at  58-59;  United  States  v.  Butenko,  494  F.2d \n15 \n593,  607  (3d  Cir.),  cert  denied  sub  nom  Ivanov  v.  United  States,  419 \n16 \n17  U.S.  881  (1974);  Damrah,  412  F.3d  at  624;  Warsame,  547  F.  Supp.  2d  at \n18  988-89.  The  defendant  advances  no  argument  to  justify any  deviation \n19  from  these  well-established  precedents. \n20 \nThe  Attorney  General  has  filed  a  declaration  in  this  case \n21 \nstating  that  disclosure  of  the  FISA  materials  or  an  adversary _he<J~ing \n22 \nwould  harm  the  national  security  of  the  United  States.  Therefore, \n23 \nFISA  mandates  that  this  Court  conduct  an  in  camera,  ex  parte  review \n24 \nof  the  challenged  FISA  materials  to  determine  whether  the  information \n25 \n26  was  lawfully  acquired  and  the  electronic  surveillance  and  physical \n27  searches  were  made  in  conformity  with  an  order  of  authorization  or \n28  approval.  In  conducting  that  review,  the  Court  may  disclose  the  FISA \n53 \n\nCase 8:14-cr-00173-CAS   Document 82   Filed 05/04/15   Page 65 of 67   Page ID #:709\n1  materials  \"only  where  such  disclosure  is  necessary  to  make  an \n2  accurate  determination  of  the  legality of  the  surveillance  [or \n3 \nsearch].\"  50  U.S.C.  §§  1806(f),  1825(g).  Congress,  in  enacting \n4 \nFISA' s  procedures  for  in  camera,  ex  parte  j.udicial  review,  has \n5 \nbalanced  and  accommodated  the  competing  interests  of  the  Government \n6 \nand  criminal  defendants,  and  has  articulated  the  proper  standard  for \n7 \ndisclosure;  that  is,  only  where  the  Court  determines  that  disclosure \n8 \n9  is  necessary  to  the  Court's  accurate  determination  of  the  legality of \n10  the  FISA  collection. \n11 \nThe  Court  can  make  this  determination  without  disclosing  the \n12 \nclassified and  highly  sensitive  FISA  materials  to  the  defendant.  The \n13 \nFISA  materials  at  issue  here  are  organized  and  readily  understood, \n14 \nand  an  overview  of  them  has  been  presented  herein  as  a  frame  of \n15 \nreference.  This  Court  will  be  able  to  render  a  determination  based \n16 \non  its  in  camera,  ex  parte  review,  and  the  defendant  has  failed  to \n17 \n18  present  any  colorable  basis  for  supplanting  Congress'  reasoned \n19  judgment  with  a  different  proposed  standard  of  review. \n20 \n[CLASSIFIED  MATERIAL  REDACTED] \n21 \nEven  if this  Court  were  to  determine  that  the  acquisition  of  the \n22 \nFISA  information  had  not  been  lawfully acquired  or  that  the \n23 \nelectronic  surveillance  was  not  made  in  conformity  with  an  order  of \n24 \nauthorization  or  approval,  the  FISA  evidence  would  nevertheless  be \n25 \n26  admissible  under  the  \"good  faith\"  exception  to  the  exclusionary  rule \n27  articulated  in  Leon,  468  U.S.  897.

Should  the  Court \nconclude  that  disclosure  of  any  item within  any  of  the  FISA  materials \n24  or  suppression  of  any  FISA-obtained  or  -derived  information may  be \nrequired,  given  the  significant  national  security  consequences  that \n25 \nwould  result  from  such  disclosure  or  suppression,  the  Government \nwould  expect  to  pursue  an  appeal.

On \nOctober 2, 2018, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District \nCourt’s judgment. On December 7, 2018, the Ninth Circuit \nentered its order denying rehearing en banc.

After \nreading a second article speculating that “hackers” may \nhave compromised the Boeing C-17 program, Agent \nHarris launched an investigation.7 For reasons never \nrevealed, the investigation targeted Petitioner Keith \nPreston Gartenlaub, a U.S. citizen, who at the time \nwas an Engineering IT Manager at Boeing in Long \nBeach, California. No evidence exists, then or now, that \n5.  (ER 378.) The following abbreviations refer to appellate \nfilings in United States v.

A previous version of the Wired.com article, \npublished in December 2012, identified the potential Boeing spy \nas Dongfan Chung. https://www.wired.com/2012/12/china-debuts-\ngiant-transport/. Chung was convicted in 2010 of providing Boeing \ntrade secrets to China (although the conviction did not involve the \nC-17), and the Ninth Circuit affirmed in 2011. See U.S. v. Chung, \n659 F.3d 815 (9th Cir. 2011).\n7.  (ER 378; AOB at 5.) \n\n4\nGartenlaub provided C-17 designs to China. He has never \nbeen charged with any national security crimes.\nIn July 2016, Chinese Citizen Su Bin was sentenced \nfor his role in plotting to steal the C-17 military cargo \nplane designs.8 \nAgent Harris’s investigation latched onto two \nprincipal facts: that Gartenlaub’s position at Boeing \nallegedly gave him access to C-17 data; and, that \nGartenlaub’s wife, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was born \nin China. Understandably, Gartenlaub travelled to China \nand communicated with his family there. He also jointly \nowned property in China with his wife. Gartenlaub hid \nnone of this. \nGartenlaub disclosed his Chinese travel to Boeing \nand received its approval. And Agent Harris knew this. \nHe knew that Gartenlaub’s communications with China \nhad nothing to do with the C-17 and were explained by \nhis family there. He knew that numerous employees \ncould access Boeings C-17 data. Nonetheless, Agent \nHarris used Gartenlaub’s alleged access—which Harris \nmisunderstood and exaggerated—his Chinese-born \nwife, and other innocuous facts to concoct a fantasy of \nGartenlaub as a Chinese spy.\nAgent Harris’s investigation was one of many launched \nat the time under intense pressure on the FBI and DOJ \n8.  See, e.g., Matt Hamilton, Chinese Citizen is Sentenced \nto Prison in the U.S. for Plotting to Steal Military Secrets, L.A. \nTimes, July 13, 2016, available at http://www.latimes.com/local/\nlanow/la-me-ln-chinese-boeing-hack-prison-sentencing-20160713-\nsnap-story.html.\n\n5\nto take action against Chinese espionage targeting \nU.S. military and trade secrets. This pressure led to \nquestionable investigations and prosecutions. Regional \nDOJ offices used secret FISA search warrants to start \nseveral non-national security prosecutions for regular \ncrimes. Many of these prosecutions collapsed for reasons \nincluding false evidentiary assumptions and accusations \nof racism against Chinese Americans.9 \nIn November, 2015, these accusations of DOJ racism \nagainst Chinese Americans led the U.S. Commission on \nCivil Rights to send a letter to U.S. Attorney General \nLoretta E. Lynch asking for an investigation into \nthe targeting of “Asian Americans for investigation, \nsurveillance, and arrest, due to their race or national \norigin.”10 Eventually, the DOJ’s main office in Washington, \nD.C. addressed these accusations of racially motivated \nnational security investigations.\nIn 2016, DOJ in Washington, D.C. issued new \nguidelines governing national security investigations \nunder the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (“FISA”). \nThe guidelines require regional DOJ prosecutors to \n9.  See, e.g., Matt Apuzzo, Former Espionage Suspect Sues, \nAccusing F.B.I. of Falsifying Evidence, N.Y. Times, May 10, \n2017 (“Each case raised the specter of Chinese espionage without \nexplicitly charging the suspects as spies.”), available at https://\nwww.nytimes.com/2017/05/10/us/politics/fbi-xi-xiaoxing.html.\n10.

Lynch, United States Attorney General (Nov. 18, 2015) \n(documenting dubious DOJ espionage investigations targeting \nAsian Americans), available at https://www.usccr.gov/press/\narchives/correspd/LettertoDOJreAsianAmericanProsecutions.\npdf.\n\n6\nconsult with national security prosecutors in Washington, \nD.C., before proceeding.11 \nBut in 2013, these guidelines didn’t exist. And, \ninitially, Agent Harris didn’t turn to FISA in his hunt \nfor Chinese spies. In June 2013, Agent Harris’s applied \nunder Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41 (“Rule 41”) \nin the Federal District Court for the Central District of \nCalifornia in Los Angeles for a criminal search warrant \ntargeting Gartenlaub’s and his wife’s emails for evidence \nof espionage.12 The court approved the warrant. The \nsubsequent search of the Gartenlaubs’ emails turned up \nno evidence of national security crimes, or any crimes \nwhatsoever.\nUndaunted, Agent Harris applied to the top secret, \nex parte Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for a \nsecret search warrant under FISA.\nIn 1978, Congress passed FISA because for decades \nthe FBI and CIA engaged in illegal regular surveillance \nof, and action against, U.S. citizens. Congress intended \nFISA, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, to \nprevent these abuses of power by federal law enforcement \nand intelligence agencies. The most infamous abuse \nbeing the FBI’s COINTELPRO activities that politically \n11.

(See AOB at 7.)\n\n7\ntargeted Americans like Martin Luther King, Jr.13 Thus, \nFISA limits searches targeting U.S. citizens to instances \nwhere there is probable cause that the citizen is an agent \nof a foreign power.14 The holds true whether for targeted \nsurveillance, or a targeted physical search.15 No such \nevidence exists in the public record that Gartenlaub was a \nforeign agent and he’s never been charged with a national \nsecurity crime. \nThe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court approved \nAgent Harris’s secret warrant application, presumably \nfor the surveillance of Gartenlaub and a physical search \nof his home, computers and hard drives.16\nThe FBI Secretly Enters Gartenlaub’s Home  \nand Images His Hard Drives\nOn January 29 and 30, 2014, FBI agents stealthily \nentered Gartenlaub’s home to execute a secret FISA \n13.  See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 94-755, Final Report of the Select \nCommittee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect \nto Intelligence Activities, at 11 (April 26, 1976) (“The Church \nReport”) (“[T]he Committee’s investigation has uncovered a host \nof serious legal and constitutional issues relating to [domestic] \nintelligence activity and it is strong proof of the need for reform \nto note that scarcely any of those issues have been addressed in \nthe courts.”), available at https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/\ncommons/7/79/Church_Committee_report_%28Book_I%2C_\nForeign_and_Military_Intelligence%29.pdf.\n14.  See 50 U.S.C. § 1804 (a)(3)(A).\n15.  Compare 50 U.S.C. § 1804 (surveillance) with 50 U.S.C. \n§ 1823 (physical searches).\n16.  (See AOB at 7.)\n\n8\nphysical search warrant. Agents secretly searched and \ndigitally imaged three hard drives they found there. Over \nthe following months, the FBI rummaged through every \nfile they found on those hard drives.\nIn its Opposition Brief before the Ninth Circuit, the \ngovernment acknowledges that there were no limitations \nto its secret search of Gartenlaub’s hard drives, saying in a \nheader: “The Government Was Permitted to Search Every \nFile on Defendant’s Computers . . . .”17 And nothing in the \nrecord indicates that the government used any standard \nforensic techniques routinely used to particularize \ncomputer searches like: date limitations; targeted key \nword searches; image recognition scans; taint teams, or \nother routine, well established techniques to limit a digital \nsearch to its target and screen out privileged, confidential, \nand irrelevant information.\nDespite its unlimited search, the FBI found no \nevidence that Gartenlaub had provided C-17 data to \nChina, or otherwise acted as a spy for China. But the \nFBI did allegedly find, among the tens of thousands of \nfiles on the hard drives, a handful of files containing child \npornography. Dropping its fantasy that Gartenlaub was \na Chinese spy, the FBI turned to the theory he collected \nchild pornography.\nThe Fed. R. Crim. P. 41 Warrants Based  \non the Fruits of the FISA Warrant\nIn August 2014, the FBI obtained a search warrant \nfor Gartenlaub’s premises seeking evidence that he \n17.  (See GB at 52.)\n\n9\nreceived and possessed child pornography.18 The August \n2014 warrant application based its probable cause on the \nfruits of the secret FISA warrant secretly executed in \nJanuary 2014, describing it as “a court-authorized search \nwithout notice” to the occupants. The probable cause \naffidavit further stated that the search discovered child \npornography on Gartenlaub’s hard drives.19 The district \ncourt then granted the application for a normal Rule 41 \nsearch warrant.\nWith its August 2014 search warrant the FBI seized \nthe three hard drives that it had already secretly imaged \nand searched for months under the FISA warrant. It also \nseized a fourth hard drive from Gartenlaub that contained \na copy of the “Origdata” folder structure that allegedly \ncontained the same files as the other three hard drives.\nOn October 23, 2014, a grand jury indicted Gartenlaub \nfor receipt and possession of child pornography in violation \nof 18 U.S.C. §§ 2252A(a)(2) and 2252A(a)(5).20\nThrough pretrial motions, he:\n1.  Challenged and sought suppression of the fruits \nof the January 2014 FISA search and the August \n2014 searches of his home, computers, and hard \ndrives, on Fourth Amendment and other grounds,\n2.  Requested a hearing under Franks v. Delaware, \n438 U.S. 154 (1978), to establish that the FISA \n18.  (ER 243.)\n19.  (ER 248-49.)\n20.  (See ER 243, 248-49, 296-97; AOB at 7).\n\n10\napplication, and the August 2014 search warrant \napplication contained intentional or reckless \nmaterial falsehoods and omissions, and\n3.  Sought disclosure of the underlying FISA \napplication and order.21 \nIn response, the government submitted a largely \nclassified, ex parte opposition to Gartenlaub’s FISA \nchallenges.22 The defense received a heavily redacted \nversion of the government’s opposition. The District Court \nreviewed the FISA application and order, together with \nthe classified portions of the government’s opposition, in \ncamera and ex parte. \nOn August 6, 2015, in an 11-page opinion drafted by \nthe government that the District Court signed unaltered, \nthe court refused to disclose to the defense the FISA \napplication and order, and denied Gartenlaub’s motion to \nsuppress the fruits of the FISA search.23 Later, however, \nthe court expressed misgivings, stating “I do have some \npersonal questions regarding the propriety of the FISA \ncourt proceeding even though that certainly seems to be \nlegally authorized.”24\nAn enormous folder on Gartenlaub’s drives with \nmultiple subfolders called “Origdata” contained less than \n100 child pornography files among thousands of other files. \n21.  (District Ct. Dkt. Nos. 67, 70, 73.)\n22.  (District Ct. Dkt. No. 82.)\n23.  (ER 21, 321.) \n24.  (District Ct Tr. at 9-10 (4/18/16).) \n\n11\nThe exact number isn’t clear. A review by the National \nCenter for Missing and Exploited Children identified 22 \nfiles. An additional 70 or so alleged child pornography files \nwere identified by non-expert agents.25\nThe evidence at trial showed that the files date to \n2005, when numerous people had access to Gartenlaub’s \ncomputer.26 No one knows who initially downloaded the \nfiles, or to what hard drive, or on to what computer \ninitially.27 No new files were added after 2005, nor is there \nany definitive evidence that any of these files were opened \nuntil the FBI opened them in 2014.28 The child pornography \nfiles were copied—along with tens of thousands of other \nfiles in an enormous folder structure—to three other \nof Gartenlaub’s hard drives. The files’ presence on four \nhard drives is consistent with someone copying the entire \ncontents of an old hard drive to a newly purchased hard \ndrive. No evidence, such as log files, screen shots, cached \ndata, or chat logs of Mr. Gartenlaub ever visiting any sites \nrelated to child pornography exists. Likewise, there’s \nno evidence or testimony of any type that Gartenlaub \ngroomed, solicited, or had sex with, minors. There is no \nevidence of the type that one would expect to find related \nto someone who collects child pornography.\n25.  (See, e.g., District Ct. Tr. at 72, 92-94 (12/4/15).)\n26.  (See ARB at 1-8.); (District Ct. Tr. at 403-05, 412-16, \n421-23 (12/9/15).)\n27.  (See ARB at 1.); (ER 193-95, 217)\n28.  (See AOB at 8.); (ER 194-95, 199-200.); (See generally \nER 193-230 (cross-examination of government computer forensic \nexpert Bruce Pixley).)\n\n12\nAs the District Court stated at sentencing, this is a \n“one-of-a-kind” child pornography case.29 The court noted \nthe absence of evidence that Gartenlaub downloaded \nthe child pornography files, the lack of evidence that the \ncollection was ever added to from 2005 until the FBI \nseized it in 2014, and the lack of evidence he ever opened \nthose files.30 \nVerdict\nThe jury found Gartenlaub guilty on both counts. The \nDistrict Court dismissed the receipt count (Count 1) as \nmultiplicitous.31 On August 29, 2016, the court sentenced \nGartenlaub to 41 months imprisonment and $3,430 in \nrestitution.32 The District Court, and the Ninth Circuit, \ndenied Gartenlaub’s motion for bail pending appeal. On \nFebruary 14, 2017, he self-surrendered into custody. He \ncurrently is out on supervised release.33\nNinth Circuit Appeal\nOn appeal to the Ninth Circuit, Gartenlaub sought \nreview of:\n1.  The District Court’s order denying his motion for \njudgment of acquittal34 \n29.  (District Ct. Tr. at 7 (8/29/16).) \n30.  (District Ct. Tr. at 5-7 (8/29/16).) \n31.  (District Ct. Dkt.

The District Court’s order denying Gartenlaub’s \nmotion for disclosure of the government’s \nFISA application, and the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court’s order authorizing the search \nof Gartenlaub’s home, computers and hard drive.37 \nGartenlaub’s trial counsel didn’t raise the issue \nconcerning the scope of the government’s search \nand seizure under the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court Order; thus the Ninth Circuit \nreviewed the issue only for plain error.38\nOn October 2, 2018, the Ninth Circuit affirmed \nthe District Court’s judgment. On December 7, 2018, \nthe Ninth Circuit, in an unpublished opinion, denied \nGartenlaub’s petition for rehearing en banc.39\n35.  (ER 23-24, 28.)\n36.  (ER 25, 29-30.)\n37.  (ER 25-28.)\n38.

Amnesty International, this Court \nreversed the Second Circuit’s holding that the plaintiffs’ \nhad standing to challenge the constitutionality of FISA’s \nsurveillance provisions targeting foreigners.40 Standing \nis not an issue here because this is a criminal case. The \ncore issue here is whether the government can use secret \nFISA investigations and search warrants to prosecute \nregular, non-national security crimes, thereby bypassing, \nin the name of national security, the Constitution’s core \ncriminal procedural guarantees.41\nAs this Court has long recognized, the primary \npurpose of the Fourth Amendment is to “secure the \nprivacies of life against arbitrary power . . . and relatedly, \nthat a central aim of the Framers was to place obstacles \nin the way of a too permeating police surveillance.”42 \nGartenlaub’s case shows how, in the talismanic name of \nnational security, FISA and the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court are contrary to this primary purpose.\n40.   See Clapper v. Amnesty Intern. USA, 568 U.S. 398 \n(2013) (holding plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the NSA’s \nwarrantless surveillance of U.S. citizens.)\n41.  “Regular crimes” refers to non-national security crimes.\n42.  Carpenter v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 2206, 2213–14 (2018) \n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n15\nThe government’s use of the fruits of a secret FISA \nsearch warrant to prosecute an unrelated regular crime, \nas happened here, is a recipe for governmental abuse. \nIn the 33 years between 1979 and 2012, the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court denied only 11 secret \nFISA applications and granted the rest. The Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court has a 99.97% approval \nrating for warrant applications.43 \nGartenlaub’s case demonstrates how easy it is to \nbypass the Constitution’s criminal procedure guarantees \nby getting a secret FISA search warrant and using it \nto prosecute regular crimes. And it is impossible for a \ncriminal defendant to challenge a secret FISA warrant \nbecause the defendant cannot access any of the information \nunderlying the FISA warrant due to its secrecy. This \nthwarts a criminal defendant’s Due Process right to test \nthe government’s case in adversarial proceedings. For \nthese reasons alone the Court should grant certiorari to \nclarify the use of non-responsive FISA evidence in regular \ncriminal proceedings.\nFISA contradicts the primary purpose of the Bill of \nRights criminal procedure amendments – the Fourth, \nFifth, and Sixth – in the name of national security. The \nprimary purpose of curtailing arbitrary police power and \npervasive government surveillance of citizens.44 Using \n43.  See Conor Clarke, Is the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nCourt Really a Rubber Stamp? 66 Stan. L. Rev. Online 125, \n125 (2014); see also, Fed’n Am. Scientists, Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act, available at https://www.fas.org/irp/agency/doj/\nfisa (last visited Mar. 06, 2019) (collecting the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court’s annual reports to Congress).)\n44.  Carpenter, 138 S. Ct. at 2214.\n\n16\nFISA, the government can use national security concerns \nto override these purposes. This is a new phenomenon.\nNational security concerns existed at the time of the \nwriting of the Bill of Rights, just as they exist now. The \nConstitution’s criminal procedure rights are older than \nthe Republic, with Due Process dating back to the Magna \nCarta. They are nothing new.\nWhat is new is the emergence in 1978 of FISA and \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. They exhibit \ncurious features relative to our legal traditions.\nFor instance, despite its awesome power to order \nsecret surveillance and searches of U.S. citizens, the \nsecret, ex parte Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \nisn’t a normal Article III court, if it is an Article III court \nat all. The court doesn’t hear any cases or controversies, \nand appears to have no adversarial proceedings.45 \nAnd it has a feature shared only by this Court - it is \nunchallengeable for a criminal defendant.\nAnother curiosity is the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court’s infallibility. FISA provides for \ndisclosure of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \napplications and orders to defendants. 46 But, in the 41-\n45.  See U.S. Constitution, Art. III, § 2 (promulgating the \njudicial power of the U.S.).\n46.  50 U.S.C. § 1806(f) (“In making this determination, the \ncourt may disclose to the aggrieved person, under appropriate \nsecurity procedures and protective orders, portions of the \napplication, order, or other materials relating to the surveillance \nonly where such disclosure is necessary to make an accurate \ndetermination of the legality of the surveillance.”)\n\n17\nyear history of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nCourt that’s never happened. Recently, some of Carter \nPage’s FISA materials were released in redacted form, \nbut that was an exceptional circumstance in which the \nFBI responded to congressional and political pressure.47 \nBut the fact remains that no defendant has ever been able \nto subject their case’s FISA application and materials to \ninvestigation and adversarial testing at trial. This doesn’t \nseem right, because no one bats 1000.\nGartenlaub’s case is an example of how the government \ncan abuse a national security investigation under FISA to \nprosecute unrelated non-national security crimes. Because \nof this risk, the government should not be permitted to \nuse secret national security warrants to prosecute regular \ncrimes if it won’t submit those warrants and supporting \nmaterials to investigation and the adversarial process \nthe criminal procedure amendments require. This Court \nshould grant certiorari to analyze and clarify the scope \nof the 1978 FISA’s encroachment upon the fundamental, \ncenturies old, criminal procedure protections of the \nFourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments.\nI.  The Court Should Grant Certiorari Because the \nFISA Search Warrant in this Case is a General \nWarrant\nThe Framers despised general warrants: \n47.  See, e.g., Charlie Savage, Carter Page FISA Documents \nare Released by Justice Department, N.Y. Times, July 21, 2018, \navailable at https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/21/us/politics/\ncarter-page-fisa.html \n\n18\nVivid in the memory of the newly independent \nAmericans were those general warrants known \nas writs of assistance under which officers of \nthe Crown had so bedeviled the colonists.” \nWrits of assistance were despised, as they gave \ncustoms officials unlimited authority to search \nwhere they wished for anything imported in \nviolation of tax laws. James Otis denounced \nwrits of assistance as “the worst instrument \nof arbitrary power, the most destructive of \nEnglish liberty, and the fundamental principles \nof law, that ever was found in an English law \nbook,” because they placed “the liberty of every \nman in the hands of every petty officer.” The \nuse of writs of assistance birthed the movement \ntoward independence. “Then and there,” said \nJohn Adams, “then and there was the first scene \nof the first act of opposition to the arbitrary \nclaims of Great Britain. Then and there the \nchild Independence was born.” 48 \nThis Court has never held that FISA warrants are an \nexception to the Fourth Amendment’s strict prohibition \non general warrants. The search of Gartenlaub’s hard \ndrives has the hallmarks of a general warrant. There was \nno practical limitation to it. The government rummaged \n48.  Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 584, 639 n. 21 (1980) \n(quoting Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616 (1886); Stanford v. \nTexas, 379 U.S. 476, 481-82 (1965)); see also Riley v. California, 573 \nU.S. 373, 403, (2014) “(Our cases have recognized that the Fourth \nAmendment was the founding generation’s response to the reviled \n“general warrants” and “writs of assistance” of the colonial era, \nwhich allowed British officers to rummage through homes in an \nunrestrained search for evidence of criminal activity.”).\n\n19\nthrough every file on his hard drives. There were no date \nrange limitations, key word searching, taint teams, or \nother routine procedures used to limit a computer search. \nThe question isn’t: Why is the search of Gartenlaub’s \nhard drives a general warrant? It’s: Why isn’t it? The \ngovernment’s answer is “national security.”\nBut national security is a limitation on the search of \nGartenlaub’s hard drives only in name. That’s why the \nNinth Circuit’s decision ignores the Fourth Amendment’s \nparticularity clause and focuses on probable cause. There \nwas no particularity to the government’s FISA search, so \nthere was nothing to discuss. \nBy invoking national security to justify its search, \nthe government is essentially using a limitation that \nFISA imposes on surveillance and searches - that they’re \nbounded by national security concerns - and saying it’s a \njustification for unbounded searching. Viewed this way, \nthe government’s justification begs the question. National \nSecurity as a limiting principal for searches becomes \nnational security as an unlimiting principal for searches.\nBut FISA is meant to limit secret national security \nsearches to situations where there’s probable cause to think \nthat an agent of a foreign power is committing a national \nsecurity crime.49 It’s meant to limit the government’s \nsearch powers, not expand them. The Ninth Circuit skirts \nthis issue when denying Gartenlaub’s appeal:\nThe idea that the government can decide that \nsomeone is a foreign agent based on secret \n49.  (App. at 24a; 50 U.S.C. § 1805(a)(2); See also United States \nv. Muhtorov, 187 F. Supp. 3d 1240 (D. Colo. 2015).)\n\n20\ninformation; on that basis obtain computers \ncontaining “[t]he sum of [that] individual’s \nprivate life,” Riley v. California, 134 S.Ct. 2473, \n2489 (2014); and then prosecute that individual \nfor completely unrelated crimes discovered as \na result of rummaging through that computer \ncomes perilously close to the exact abuses \nagainst which the Fourth Amendment was \ndesigned to protect.50\nGartenlaub’s case doesn’t “come perilously close” \nto the Fourth Amendment’s protections, it’s the exact \nfact pattern the Fourth Amendment prohibits. The \nNinth Circuit offers no explanation for why we’re just \n“perilously” close to a Fourth Amendment violation rather \nthan right in the middle of one. Gartenlaub’s case has the \nearmarks of potential violations of the Fourth Amendment \nProbable Cause and Particularity clauses: \n1.  A secret, unlimited government search\n2.  Executed under a secret national security \nwarrant, based on the probable cause that \nGartenlaub is the agent of a foreign power\n3.  That turns up no evidence that Gartenlaub is a \nforeign agent\n4.  But does turn up evidence of an unrelated non-\nnational security crime\n50.  (App. at 4a. (United States v. Gartenlaub, No. 16-50339, \n2018 WL 4761630, at *1 (9th Cir. Oct. 2, 2018) (Appeal Dkt. 94.).)\n\n21\n5.  Which then is used as probable cause for regular \nRule 41 search warrants,\n6.  Resulting in Gartenlaub’s conviction for the \nunrelated, non-national security crime.\nOne is left to wonder how there could be probable \ncause for the FISA warrant when a methodical, months \nlong rummaging through all of the files on Gartenlaub’s \nhard drives turned up no evidence he was a spy. \nFISA warrants do enjoy a degree of flexibility that \nnormal regular criminal warrants do not possess.51 But \nprecisely because this flexibility is limited to matters of \nnational security. And the fact that FISA searches are \nsecret, easy to abuse, and prone to turning into general \nwarrants, argue for more stringent review of probable \ncause determinations for FISA warrants rather than the \nlax ones. FISA warrants are only appropriate in particular \ncircumstances, and the Fourth Amendment limits the \nscope of FISA. Courts recognize the government’s \ninterest in speed, stealth, and secrecy in surveillance \nin national security investigations.52 But FISA doesn’t \npermit searches for evidence of regular crimes.53 FISA \nis not a license for the government to conduct fishing \nexpeditions into the lives and data of private individuals.\n51.  (See BAC at 7-8.)\n52.  United States v. Troung Dinh Hung, 629 F.2d 908, 915 \n(4th Cir. 1980).\n53.  See 50 U.S.C. § 1804(a)(3)(a) (requiring that the applicant \nfor a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court warrant have a \njustified belief that “the target of the electronic surveillance is a \nforeign power or an agent of a foreign power . . . .”).\n\n22\nThe Ninth Circuit doesn’t discuss the Fourth \nAmendment’s particularity  clause in analyzing \nGartenlaub’s secret FISA search. The Ninth Circuit \nonly says its ex parte, in camera review, with the helpful \npresence of the government, supported the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court’s probable cause \ndetermination.54 But analyzing probable cause is just \none part of the general warrant analysis. The analysis \nhas to include the clause that specifically targets general \nwarrants: the Particularity Clause.\nThe Fourth Amendment’s Probable Cause Clause and \nParticularity Clause are two logically, albeit interrelated, \ndistinct clauses. A warrant can be supported by probable \ncause and still violate the Particularity Clause:\nTo satisfy the demands of the Warrant Clause, \na warrant must comply with two related but \ndistinct rules. First, it must describe the place \nto be searched or things to be seized with \nsufficient particularity, taking account of “the \ncircumstances of the case and the types of items \ninvolved. Second, it must be no broader than \nthe probable cause on which it is based. The \nparticularity rule and the probable cause rule \nserve a common purpose: to protect privacy by \nprohibiting a general, exploratory rummaging \nin a person’s belongings. Although the two rules \nserve the same ultimate purpose, they achieve \nthe purpose in distinct ways. 55 \n54.  (Id.)\n55.  United States v. Weber, 923 F.2d 1338, 1342 (9th Cir. \n1990) (citations omitted).\n\n23\nThere is good reason to think the FISA warrant \nat issue here lacked particularity. The government \nadmits in its Opposition Brief that there was no practical \nlimitation to the FISA warrant, and that it could search \neach and every file on Gartenlaub’s computer.56 The \ngovernment makes no mention that it ever placed any of \nthe recognized, standard limitations for digital searches \nlike date limitations, key word searching, or taint teams, \non its search of Gartenlaub’s digital storage devices. It \njust asserts it could search everything it wanted to, and \nit did so.\nThis Court should grant certiorari to prevent the \ngovernment from using national security pretexts to make \nan end run around the Fourth Amendment’s prohibitions \non general warrants. \nII.  The Court Should Grant Certiorari to Impose Use \nRestrictions on Non-Responsive Evidence of Non-\nNational Security Crimes Obtained Through FISA \nComputer Searches\nComputer searches are especially prone to turning \ninto rummaging that amounts to a general warrant, and \nthis Court, and others, have repeatedly expressed their \nconcerns on this front.57 This has led courts and leading \n56.  (See GB at 52.)\n57.  See, e.g., Riley v. California, 573 U.S. 373, 403 (2014); \nUnited States v. Ganias, 824 F.3d 199 (2nd Cir 2016); United \nStates v. Richards, 659 F.3d 527 (6th Cir. 2011); United States v. \nComprehensive Drug Testing, Inc., 621 F. 3d 1162 (9th Cir. 2010); \nUnited States v. Mann, 592 F.3d 779 (7th Cir 2010); United States \nv.

Tamura, \n\n24\ncomputer law scholars to propose use restrictions upon \ndigital information non-responsive to a search warrant.58 \nIn the case of secret FISA evidence, these use restrictions \nwould be on top of FISA’s required minimization \ntechniques meant to limit the use of non-national security \nevidence.59 The Court should grant certiorari to consider \nthese type of use restrictions on non-responsive evidence \nderived from FISA computer searches.\nAs this Court recently held in Carpenter, computer \nsearches implicate two of the Framer’s core Fourth \nAmendment concerns: Securing “the privacies of life” \nagainst arbitrary police power and “plac[ing] obstacles \nin the way of a too permeating police surveillance.”60 \nThe government rummaged through “the privacies” of \nGartenlaub’s life when it examined every file in his hard \ndrives.\nLaw enforcement is always alert to the broadest \npossible search methods. That’s part of their job. Invoking \n694 F.2d 591, 595-96 (9th Cir. 1982); United States v. Jae Shik Kim, \n103 F. Supp. 3d 32 (D.C. 2015); see also, United States v. Perez, \n712 Fed.

Rev. 1, at 18 (2015).\n59.  (App. at 45a-46a, (50 U.S.C. §§ 1801(h) and 1821(4).))\n60.  Carpenter v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 2206, 2213–14, \n(2018) (citing Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, 630, (1886) and \nUnited States v. Di Re, 332 U.S. 581, 595 (1948)); see also Riley v. \nCalifornia, 573 U.S. 373, 395-96, (2014) (“An Internet search and \nbrowsing history . . . could reveal an individual’s private interests \nor concerns—perhaps a search for certain symptoms of disease, \ncoupled with frequent visits to WebMD.”).\n\n25\nnational security to search for evidence of a regular crime \nis a tempting and easy way to get around the Fourth, \nFifth, and Sixth Amendments.\nThe problem of a computer search turning into a \ngeneral warrant is more acute with a FISA case because \nthe warrants aren’t subject to adversarial review. This \npractically means that the government’s actions aren’t \nsubject to the defendant’s or the publics review. This \nCourt should grant certiorari to impose use restrictions \non evidence of non-national security regular crimes \ndiscovered during the execution of a secret, general FISA \nwarrant, to prevent government abuse.\nIII. The Court Should Grant Certiorari to Determine \nWhether the District Court’s Denying Gartenlaub \na Franks Hearing on the FISA Warrant Requires \nSuppression of the Fruits of that Warrant\nThe Fourth Amendment requires all warrants to issue \nonly on probable cause.61 FISA limits this requirement \nfurther, mandating that FISA warrants only issue upon \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court’s finding \nof probable cause that someone is an agent of a foreign \npower.62 Presumably, the government’s application for a \nFISA warrant argued that Gartenlaub was spying by \nsending China plans for the U.S. military’s C-17 cargo \nplane. But skepticism is warranted here because there’s \nno evidence in the public record to support it.\n61.  U.S. Const. Amend. IV (1789).\n62.  (App. at 24a, (50 U.S.C. § 1805(a)(2).)).\n\n26\nGartenlaub has never been charged with a national \nsecurity crime. The original investigation launched during \nthe same period of other false FISA investigations under \nsimilar national security pretexts. And it started with a \nwhimper – when an FBI Agent read a magazine article, not \nwith a bang from some dramatic event. The search warrant \nthat resulted from the FBI’s online reading turned up \nnothing after it was executed on the Gartenlaubs’ emails. \nNeither did the FISA search, or it presumably would have \nled to a national security prosecution.\nThe defense, and the public, will never know. We must \ntrust that the national security matters involved are so \nimportant that they eliminate the constitutional rights \nto public adversarial challenge. The defense, and the \npublic, must trust that the secret, ex parte probable cause \ndeterminations made after secret conference between \nthe government and the judiciary, at every step in this \nprocess, was free from confirmation bias, or other errors \nthat the defendant could argue to the court or jury.63 \nThis is not consistent with the underlying philosophy \nof the Bill of Rights, nor is it consistent with the \nadversarial foundation of our criminal justice system. Both \nare skeptical of government and rely on the adversarial \nsystem, as outlined in the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth \nAmendments, to test the government. Both are skeptical \nof ex parte evidentiary determinations.\nTowards the end of the recording of the Ninth Circuit \noral arguments in this case, you can hear the court confirm \n63.  See Adam Benforado, Unfair: The New Science of Criminal \nInjustice (Broadway Books 2015) (discussing confirmation bias and \ncriminal evidence).\n\n27\nits upcoming, ex parte, meeting with the government \nto secretly review the FISA materials.64 The ex parte \nreview of search warrants, to say nothing of secret search \nwarrants, is precisely what the Framers sought to limit \nwhen they drafted the Fourth Amendment’s warrant \nclause. The Framers were seeking to minimize ex parte \nsearch warrants issued by the judiciary and government \nwhen they wrote the Fourth Amendment—not maximize \ntheir use—because of the abuse they suffered under \nsuch warrants. The history of the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court is validating the Framer’s concerns on \nthis front.65 To study the drafting and intent of the Fourth \nAmendment is to learn how wary the Framers were of ex \nparte search warrants.\nThe Ninth Circuit’s decision analyzes the issues in \nGartenlaub’s case solely from the perspective of probable \ncause. But the probable cause analysis can’t be properly \nevaluated because the opinion provides no reasoning or \nfactual basis to evaluate whether the execution of the \nwarrant was broader than that justified by its probable \ncause.66 An adversarial proceeding would have solved \nthat issue. \n64.  Oral Argument, United States v. Keith Preston Gartenlaub, \nNo. 16-50339 (9th Cir., Dec. 4, 2017), available at https://www.ca9.\nuscourts.gov/media/view.php?pk_id=0000031669.\n65.  See Akhil Reed Amar, The Constitution and Criminal \nProcedure: First Principles, 1-45, 13 (Yale 1997) (“Warrants, then, \nwere friends of the searcher, not the searched. They had to be limited; \notherwise, central officers on the government payroll in ex parte \nproceedings would usurp the role of the good old jury in striking \nthe proper balance between government and citizen after hearing \nlawyers on both sides.”).\n66.  See Weber, 923 F.2d at 1345 (holding that “a blunderbuss \nwarrant [in a CP case] was unjustified.”).\n\n28\nThat Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court probable \ncause determinations for FISA warrants aren’t subject to \na defendant’s adversarial challenge raises the issue of \nwhether evidence outside the scope of the probable cause \nfor a FISA search, discovered as part of the FISA search, \nshould be suppressed when it’s used in an unrelated non-\nnational security prosecution. The Court should grant \ncertiorari to review the issue.\nIV. The Court Should Grant Certiorari Because In the \n41 Year History of FISA No Defendant Has Ever \nHad Access to Their Case’s Secret FISA Application \nand this Violates the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth \nAmendments\nEven though FISA provides for disclosing applications \nto defendants, that’s never happened in 41 years.67 The \ncase law is opaque as to precisely why, because most of \nthe facts are secret and thus aren’t in the decisions. This \nis harmful to stare decisis. Because if you don’t know the \nunderlying facts to a decision in our common law system, \nthen you don’t really know what’s been decided. And you \ncannot use that case to argue for your position, or against \nyour adversaries.\nFISA is distorting our adversarial, precedential, and \ncommon law system in subtle ways. For instance, in its \ndenial of Gartenlaub’s appeal, the Ninth Circuit stated \n67.   With the recent exception of Carter Page’s FISA \nmaterials. But that was outside the context of a criminal trial. \nSee, Jeremy Herb and David Shortell, FBI Releases Carter Page \nSurveillance Warrant Documents, CNN, July 23, 2018, available \nat https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/21/politics/fbi-carter-page-\nsurveillance-warrant/index.html\n\n29\nthat “[n]o controlling authority dictates the conclusion \nthat the government’s [FISA] search and subsequent \nuse of FISA-derived materials in a non-national security \nprosecution violates the Fourth Amendment, such that \nthe district court’s failure to follow it was plain error.”68 \nBut how is a defendant supposed to find case law for that \nproposition when the case law is factually opaque? Judicial \ndecisions based on secret, undisclosed fact finding are \ninimical to stare decisis and the truth finding function of \nour adversarial system.\nBecause facts in FISA cases are murky, it’s hard to \ntell how many cases involve computer searches like in \nGartenlaub’s. None are readily apparent. 69 Most reported \nFISA cases involving non-national security prosecutions \nseem to involve incidental surveillance of the regular \ncrime as it happened, or a non-national security crime like \nwire fraud or money laundering, that was directly related \nto the national security investigation. \n68.

For the crime \nof “writing books and pamphlets,” Prynne’s “ears were \nfirst cut off by court order and . . . subsequently, by another \ncourt order, . . . his remaining ear stumps [were] gouged \nout while he was on a pillory.”75\nThe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court isn’t \nthe Star Chamber. Yet. But the fact that even a mild \ncomparison can be made should give pause. The Star \nChamber was a secret, virtually infallible, inquisitorial \n76\nEnglish court that did the monarch’s bidding.   It too, \n74.  See, e.g., Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471 (1963) \n(holding that evidence obtained through the exploitation of an \nillegal search is fruit of the poisonous tree, which should be \nsuppressed).\n75.  Akhil Reed Amar, The Bill of Rights: Creation and \nReconstruction, 82 (Yale University Press 1998)\n76.  See Jones v. Sec. & Exch. Comm’n, 298 U.S. 1, 28 (1936) \n(discussing the “ intolerable abuses of the Star Chamber, which \nbrought that institution to an end at the hands of the Long \nParliament in 1640”); United States v. Gecas, 120 F.3d 1419, 1446 \n(11th Cir. 1997) (discussing history of the Star Chamber in depth).\n\n32\nwas held in the highest regard and deference by the \njudiciary. The King’s Bench held that “the Court of the \nStar Chamber was . . . one of the most high and honourable \nCourts of Justice . . . .”77 Notably, when the Long \nParliament abolished the Star Chamber in 1641, it did so \nwith the statute that enscribed the writ of habeas corpus \ninto the law books for the first time. Habeas corpus, “the \ngreat writ” is the fundamental guarantor of our right to \nchallenge government prosecution, and the Constitution’s \nonly named privilege.78 It was no coincidence.\nFISA and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \ncontradict our Republic’s traditions. The Framers had \nample opportunity and cause to establish secret national \nsecurity courts in the early days of our Republic. Despite \nthe threats to our country at the time, they chose not to.\nGeorge Washington was no stranger to national \nsecurity threats and President of the Constitutional \nConvention. When the Framers drafted the Constitution \nthe U.S. faced threats on all sides. Ten thousand British \ntroops were still stationed on the Northwestern Frontier \nencouraging the Native Americans to engage in border \nwarfare with the States. The Spanish controlled Florida \nand the mouth of the Mississippi. Shay’s Rebellion had just \noccurred, and our disgruntled European creditors were \nmaking rumblings of war over our unpaid Revolutionary \n77.  William F. Duker, A Constitutional History of Habeas \nCorpus, 46-47 (Greenwood Press 1980) (quoting Chamber’s Case, \n79 Eng. Rep. 746, 747 (K.B. 1630).)\n78.  Duker, at 47; U.S. Const. Art. I, §9, cl. 2.\n\n33\nWar debts. 79 George Washington knew better than anyone \nthe risks our nation faced. Yet none of them instituted \na secret court like Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nCourt. They would rightly view the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court, and FISA, with suspicion and concern.\nBecause they fought a revolution against secrecy, \narbitrary government power, and government prying \nin our private lives. And they fixed these values in the \ncriminal procedural protections of the Fourth, Fifth. and \nSixth Amendments. The Constitution would never have \npassed without these protections. The States wouldn’t \nhave ratified the Constitution if they hadn’t been promised \nthe Bill of Rights and its criminal procedural guarantees. \nFISA and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nCourt are newcomers to this tradition. It’s only in 1978, \nover 200 years after the founding of our nation and the \nmultiple wars we’ve fought and threats we’ve faced, that \na secret national security court emerges. The irony of \nFISA and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is \nthat Congress created them to protect us from an internal \nthreat, but only made that threat worse.\nFISA came into being not as a response to any new \nexternal threat to our national security. Congress passed \n79.  See, Joseph J. Ellis, American Dialogue: The Founders \nand Us, 194 (Alfred A. Knopf 2018); Tor Ekeland, Suspending \nHabeas Corpus: Article I, Section 9, Clause 2, of the United States \nConstitution and the War on Terror, 74 Fordham L. Rev. 1475, \n1482 (2005 (“On May 14, 1787, when the Federal Constitutional \nConvention assembled, the United States faced substantial threats \nto its security on all sides.”), available at https://ir.lawnet.fordham.\nedu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4129&context=flr.\n\n34\nFISA because of the FBI’s and CIA’s illegal spying \nand actions against U.S. citizens that the courts failed \nto address. The Church Committee Report, which led \nto FISA’s passage details this in depth.80 But now, as \nGartenlaub’s case demonstrates, history is repeating \nitself and the FISA is slowly eroding the fundamental \nprotections of the Constitution’s criminal procedure \nguarantees.\nThis Court should grant certiorari to strike the \nright balance between the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth \nAmendments’ criminal procedure protections and our \nnational security interests. And to keep those national \nsecurity interests from encroaching on our Liberty.\n80.  See S. Rep. No. 94-755, Final Report of the Select \nCommittee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to \nIntelligence Activities, at 11 (April 26, 1976) (“[T]he Committee’s \ninvestigation has uncovered a host of serious legal and constitutional \nissues relating to [domestic] intelligence activity and it is strong \nproof of the need for reform to note that scarcely any of those issues \nhave been addressed in the courts.”), available at https://upload.\nwikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Church_Committee_\nreport_%28Book_I%2C_Foreign_and_Military_Intelligence%29.\npdf; see also, Elizabeth Goitein and Faiza Patel, What Went Wrong \nWith the FISA Court, Brennan Center for Justice (2015), available \nat https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/publications/\nWhat_Went_%20Wrong_With_The_FISA_Court.pdf.\n\n35\nCONCLUSION\nThis case shows how easily the government can \nbypass the fundamental criminal procedure protections \nof the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments by invoking \nnational security under FISA. This Court should grant \ncertiorari to review the proper balance between the \nfundamental criminal procedure protections of the \nFourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments, FISA, and the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court, and to reverse \nGartenlaub’s conviction.\nRespectfully submitted,\ntor ekeland\nCounsel of Record\nMark Jaffe\nlydIa fIelds\ntor ekeland law PllC\n195 Montague Street, 14th Floor\nBrooklyn, NY 11201\n(718) 737-7264\ntor@torekeland.com\nCounsel for Petitioner\n\nAPPENDIX\n\n1a\nAPPENDIX A —A MppEeMndOixR AANDUM OF THE \nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE \nNINTH CIRCUIT, FILED OCTOBER 2, 2018\nIN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\nDocket No. 16-50339\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, \nPlaintiff-Appellee, \nv. \nKEITH PRESTON GARTENLAUB,  \nAKA KEITH PRESON GARTENLAUB, \nDefendant-Appellant.\nDecember 4, 2017, Argued  \nand Submitted, Pasadena, California;  \nOctober 2, 2018, Filed\nAppeal from the United States District Court for the \nCentral District of California. D.C. No. 8:14-cr-00173-\nCAS-1. Christina A. Snyder, District Judge, Presiding.\n\n2a\nAppendix A\nMEMORANDUM*\nBefore: WARDLAW and GOULD, Circuit Judges, and \nPIERSOL,** District Judge.\nKeith Gartenlaub appeals his conviction for knowingly \npossessing child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. \n§ 2252A(a)(5)(B). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1291, and we affirm.1\n1. There was sufficient evidence to sustain Gartenlaub’s \nconviction for knowing possession of child pornography. \nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to \nthe prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have \nfound the essential elements of the crime—including \nknowledge—beyond a reasonable doubt. The government \npresented sufficient evidence that Gartenlaub knew the \nchild pornography was present on his computers. See 18 \nU.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B) (requiring that the defendant must \n“knowingly possess[] . . . any . . . computer disk, or any other \nmaterial that contains an image of child pornography that \nhas been . . . transported using any means or facility of \ninterstate or foreign commerce . . . including by computer”).\n* This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not \nprecedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.\n** The Honorable Lawrence L. Piersol, United States District \nJudge for the District of South Dakota, sitting by designation.\n1. The government’s motion to file an oversized brief, Dkt 51, \nis GRANTED.\n\n3a\nAppendix A\nThe government demonstrated that an individual \nintentionally downloaded child pornography, copied it onto \nGartenlaub’s hard drives, and organized and reorganized \nthe child pornography into folders reflecting the content \nof the videos. See 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B). A rational \njury could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt \nthat the user of the password-protected “Keith” account \nopened a folder containing obviously child-pornographic \nfilenames and then copied those files onto a new computer, \nthat “Keith” knowingly downloaded and organized the \nchild pornography collection in the first place, and that \n“Keith” was Keith Gartenlaub himself. See United States \nv. Nevils, 598 F.3d 1158, 1164 (9th Cir. 2010) (en banc); \nUnited States v. Willard, 230 F.3d 1093, 1095 (9th Cir. \n2000) (citing Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S. \nCt. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979)).\n2. The district court did not commit plain error \nby failing to suppress the evidence from Gartenlaub’s \ncomputer as inadmissible for violating the Fourth \nAmendment.2\nNo controlling authority dictates the conclusion that \nthe government’s Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \n(“FISA”) search and subsequent use of FISA-derived \nmaterials in a non-national security prosecution violates \nthe Fourth Amendment, such that the district court’s \nfailure to follow it was plain error. See United States v. \n2. Plain error review is the appropriate standard because \nGartenlaub did not assert the Fourth Amendment argument \npredicated on alleged misuse of the FISA warrant before the district \ncourt.\n\n4a\nAppendix A\nGonzalez-Aparicio, 663 F.3d 419, 428 (9th Cir. 2011), as \namended (Nov. 16, 2011). Our decision in United States \nv. Comprehensive Drug Testing, Inc., 621 F.3d 1162 (9th \nCir. 2010) (en banc), abrogation recognized by Demaree \nv. Pederson, 887 F.3d 870 (9th Cir. 2018) (per curiam), is \ninapposite; it did not decide the question presented by this \ncase and, in fact, addressed no national security concerns \nparticular to the FISA context.\nThe idea that the government can decide that someone \nis a foreign agent based on secret information; on that \nbasis obtain computers containing “[t]he sum of [that] \nindividual’s private life,” Riley v. California, 134 S. Ct. \n2473, 2489, 189 L. Ed. 2d 430 (2014); and then prosecute \nthat individual for completely unrelated crimes discovered \nas a result of rummaging through that computer comes \nperilously close to the exact abuses against which the \nFourth Amendment was designed to protect.3 However, \nthe district court did not commit plain error by concluding \notherwise.\n3. Based upon our independent review of the classified \nrecord evidence, we conclude that the FISA warrant \nwas supported by probable cause. The FISA application \nand supporting materials demonstrated probable cause \nto believe that Gartenlaub was an agent of a foreign \npower when the FISA order was issued. See 50 U.S.C. \n§§ 1801(b), 1821(1), 1824(a)(2).4 The district court did not \n3. We thank amici curiae, Electronic Frontier Foundation and \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union, for their thought-provoking briefing.\n4. Although there is a split in the circuits as to what deference to \nafford a district court’s determination that a FISA order was based \n\n5a\nAppendix A\nerr in denying Gartenlaub a Franks hearing. The district \ncourt did not err in “finding that the government did not \nintentionally or recklessly make false statements.” United \nStates v. Christie, 825 F.3d 1048, 1069 (9th Cir. 2016) \n(citation omitted); see Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, \n98 S. Ct. 2674, 57 L. Ed. 2d 667 (1978).\n4. We have conducted an in camera review of the \nunderlying FISA materials. We conclude that the \ndisclosure of the FISA materials to Gartenlaub was \nnot “necessary to make an accurate determination of \nthe legality of the search.” 50 U.S.C. § 1825(g); see also \nUnited States v. Ott, 827 F.2d 473, 476-77 (9th Cir. 1987) \n(finding “no indications of possible misrepresentation of \nfact, vague identification of the persons to be surveilled, \nor surveillance records which include a significant amount \nof non-foreign intelligence information, or any other \nfactors that would indicate a need for disclosure” (internal \nquotation marks omitted)). In point of fact, disclosure \nwas not necessary even under a less rigorous standard \nthan that proposed by the government. As well, the non-\ndisclosure violated neither Gartenlaub’s due process nor \nBrady rights. See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S. \nCt. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963); Ott, 827 F.2d at 476-77.\nAFFIRMED.\non probable cause, we do not resolve here which level of deference \nis appropriate as we are convinced probable cause existed under \neither a de novo or an abuse of discretion standard of review. See \nUnited States v. Turner, 840 F.3d 336, 340 (7th Cir. 2016) (applying \na de novo standard of review); United States v. Hassan, 742 F.3d \n104, 139 n.29 (4th Cir. 2014) (noting that the Fourth Circuit applies \na de novo standard although the Fifth and Second Circuits apply a \nmore deferential standard).\n\n6a\nAPPENDIX B — JUADpGpeMnEdiNx TB AND PROBATION/\nCOMMITMENT ORDER OF THE UNITED STATES \nDISTRICT COURT FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT \nOF CALIFORNIA, FILED SEPTEMBER 6, 2016\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA vs.\nDefendant KEITH PRESTON GARTENLAUB\nakas: N/A\nDocket No. SACR14-173-CAS\nSocial Security No. 9 4 2 9 (Last 4 digits)\nJUDGMENT AND PROBATION/ \nCOMMITMENT ORDER \nIn the presence of the attorney for the government, \nthe defendant appeared in person on this date.

Because no sufficient cause \nto the contrary was shown, or appeared \nto the Court, the Court adjudged the \nJUDGMENT  defendant guilty as charged and convicted \nAND PROB/ and ordered that:\nCOMM  Pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act \nORDER of 1984, it is the judgment of the Court \nthat the defendant is hereby committed \nto Count 2 of the 2-Count Indictment to \nthe custody of the Bureau of Prisons to be \nimprisoned for a term of: FORTY-ONE \n(41) MONTHS.\nIt is ordered that the defendant shall pay to the United \nStates a special assessment of $100.00, which is due \nimmediately. Any unpaid balance shall be due during \nthe period of imprisonment, at the rate of not less than \n$25.00 per quarter, and pursuant to the Bureau of Prisons’ \nInmate Financial Responsibility Program.\nThe defendant shall comply with General Order No. 01-05.\n\n8a\nAppendix B\nAll fines are waived as it is found that such sanction would \nplace an undue burden on the defendant’s dependent.\nIt is ordered that the defendant shall pay restitution in the \ntotal amount of $3,430.00, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3663A.\nThe amount of restitution ordered shall be paid to the \nvictim as set forth in a separate victim list prepared \nby the probation office which this Court adopts and \nwhich reflects the Court’s determination of the amount \nof restitution due to each victim. The victim list, which \nshall be forwarded to the fiscal section of the clerk’s \noffice, shall remain confidential to protect the privacy \ninterests of the victim. Restitution shall be due during \nthe period of imprisonment, at the rate of not less than \n$25.00 per quarter, and pursuant to the Bureau of Prisons’ \nInmate Financial Responsibility Program. If any amount \nof the restitution remains unpaid after release from \ncustody, nominal monthly payments of at least $100.00 \nor ten percent of the defendant’s gross monthly income, \nwhichever is greater, shall be made during the period \nof supervised release. These payments shall begin 30 \ndays after the commencement of supervision. Nominal \nrestitution payments are ordered as the Court finds that \nthe defendant’s economic circumstances do not allow \nfor either immediate or future payment of the amount \nordered. \nPursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3612(f)(3)(A), interest on the \nrestitution ordered is waived because the defendant does \nnot have the ability to pay interest. Payments may be \nsubject to penalties for default and delinquency pursuant \nto 18 U.S.C. § 3612(g).\n\n9a\nAppendix B\nUpon release from imprisonment, the defendant shall be \nplaced on supervised release for a term of life under the \nfollowing terms and conditions:\n1.

The district court accepted the government's argument, as has every \ncourt since FISA was enacted (with the exception of one district court, which was later \nreversed). \nOn February 2, 2018, the President--head of the same Executive Branch that is \nprosecuting  appellant  Gartenlaub--declassified  and  approved  release  of  a  House \nPermanent Select Committee on Intelligence (\"HPSCI\") majority memorandum (attached \nas Exhibit A) that summarizes portions of a FISA application targeting an American \ncitizen.  According to the cover letter from the Counsel to the President, the President \ndeclassified the memorandum because \"the public interest in disclosure outweighs any \nneed to protect the information.\"  The Speaker of the House of Representatives observed \nthat release of the HPSCI memorandum \"provide[s] greater transparency\" concerning \nFISA and helps \"ensure the FISA system works as intended and Americans' rights are \nproperly  safeguarded.\"    Al  Weaver,  Paul  Ryan:  Nunes  memo  lays  out  a  'specific, \nlegitimate' worry about surveillance, Washington Examiner, Feb. 2, 2018.   \nOn  February  24,  2018,  HPSCI  released  a  redacted,  declassified  version  of  a \nminority memorandum (attached as Exhibit B), which challenges certain assertions made \nin  the  majority  memorandum.    The  minority  memorandum,  like  the  majority \nmemorandum, summarizes portions of the underlying FISA application. \n \n\nMs. Molly C. Dwyer, Clerk \nFebruary 24, 2018 \nPage | 2 \n \nThe declassification of the HPSCI memoranda demonstrates that it is possible to \ndiscuss publicly the merits of a FISA application without damaging national security.  In \naddition,  the  declassification  of  the  memoranda  highlights  the  absurdity  of  the \ngovernment's  assertion,  in  this  and  other  cases  involving  motions  to  suppress  FISA \nsurveillance, that any disclosure of a FISA application, even to cleared defense counsel \nunder the protections of CIPA, would harm national security.  If the HPSCI memoranda \ncan  be  disclosed  without  harming  national  security,  as  the  Executive  Branch  has \ndetermined, at least comparable disclosure of the Gartenlaub FISA application can be \nmade to cleared defense counsel under CIPA without causing such harm.      \n                   \n                Very truly yours, \n \n                John D.
