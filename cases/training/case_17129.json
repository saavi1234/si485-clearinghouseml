    "summary": "<p>The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) requires the government to obtain a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) before it may conduct any domestic electronic surveillance to acquire foreign intelligence information. The warrant applications are made ex parte and must include a sworn statement by a federal officer of the facts and circumstances relied upon to justify the government's belief that the target of surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power. Once a FISC judge receives a warrant application, the judge can order approval of the surveillance only if the judge finds that there is probable cause to believe that the target of the electronic surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power. Because the orders only authorize surveillance up to 90 days, the government must file an application for an extension that meets the same requirements as the initial warrant application and obtain a renewal order from the FISC for continued surveillance. For the Civil Rights Litigation Clearinghouse collection of FISA matters, see our <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/results.php?searchSpecialCollection=20\">special collection</a>.</p><p>On July 22, 2015, the New York Times and reporter Charlie Savage filed this suit against the United States Department of Treasury (Treasury) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. According to their complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that Mr. Savage had submitted a FOIA request to the Treasury on September 30, 2014, seeking disclosure of \"documents showing the legal conclusions accepted by the Treasury Department as the governing legal protocol for under what circumstances, if any, and at what stage of the process, FISA's notice provision applies to the Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioning decisions and challenges to them.\" The Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) administers sanction programs against foreign individuals and entities; among these programs are the Counter Terrorism Sanctions, which are aimed at those individuals and entities associated with terrorism. Because FISA contains a notice provision that requires the Government to disclose when it uses information from its surveillance in any \"proceeding\" against people, there had been questions of whether this notice provision applied to OFAC terrorism sanctions. </p><p>On April 13, 2015, the Treasury denied Mr. Savage's FOIA request, stating that OFAC had located only one document responsive to the FOIA request, but that this document was exempt from disclosure due to attorney-client privilege and deliberative law privilege. After unsuccessfully filing an appeal with the Treasury, the plaintiffs alleged in this lawsuit that the Treasury had no lawful basis under FOIA for withholding the requested document, which the plaintiffs viewed as the agency's \"working law.\" Accordingly, the plaintiffs requested that the court order the Treasury to provide the requested documents. </p><p>On December 23, 2015, the Treasury filed a motion for summary judgment. It argued that the document was properly withheld and that the document could not be considered \"working law\" since the document's legal analysis had not been adopted by the Treasury and was not being used as a reference document by OFAC. The Treasury further argued that the document was protected by attorney-client privilege because the document memorialized preliminary advice that Treasury attorneys developed and communicated to OFAC officials regarding their obligations under FISA. Moreover, the document was protected by \"deliberative process\" or \"executive\" privilege, which protects the decisionmaking processes of the executive branch, because it was prepared \"as part of the Treasury's decisionmaking process regarding OFAC's legal obligations under FISA.\"</p><p>On August 2, 2016, United States District Judge Edgardo Ramos partially granted the Treasury's motion for summary judgment as to the withholding of the document in question. However, Judge Ramos directed the Treasury to submit affidavits or declarations describing the adequacy of its initial search for documents responsive to Mr. Savage's FOIA initial FOIA request.</p><p>On September 22, 2016, the Treasury submitted two declarations. The first declaration was by M. William Schisa, Senior Counsel in the Office of the Chief Counsel, Foreign Assets Control at the Treasury. Mr. Schisa stated that he had identified the document in question as the only potentially responsive document in his possession or control and that he was confident that there were no other potentially responsive documents in his possession or control. He detailed the search terms he used and the locations he searched, both physical and electronic. The second declaration was by Marshall H. Fields, Jr., Assistant Director, Information Disclosure and Records Management Division of OFAC. He summarized the steps his office took in responding to Mr. Savage's FOIA request, provided an overview of OFAC's record system, and outlined additional searches his office conducted during the course of this litigation. He concluded that the search methods utilized by his office would have located additional records if any additional records responsive to Mr. Savage's FOIA request existed.</p><p>On October 20, 2016, the parties stipulated to settle their claims. The plaintiffs stated that they no longer wished to further contest the adequacy of the Treasury's search. Judge Ramos approved the stipulation.</p><p></p>",

Plaintiffs had submitted a FOIA request for documents relating to the Treasury's protocol for dealing with FISA's notice provision when its Office of Foreign Assets Control administers sanction programs against individuals and entities associated with terrorism. The Treasury had identified only one document responsive to this FOIA request, but had refused to produce it, citing attorney-client privilege and deliberative law privilege. The plaintiffs sought to compel the Treasury to release the document, but the Treasury successfully withheld it from disclosure because it was a draft document, rather than a final, \"working law\" document. After the Treasury submitted declarations explaining its search procedures and declaring that no other responsive documents existed, the parties reached a settlement in October 2016. The case closed in October 2016.",

Plaintiff Charlie Savage is a reporter for The New York Times. \n4.  Defendant the Treasury is an agency of the federal government.  Among \nits many functions, it regulates the activities of U.S. citizens and corporations wishing to do \nbusiness or engage in other transactions with individuals and entities that commit, threaten to \n1 \n59101 \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05740-ER   Document 1   Filed 07/22/15   Page 2 of 5\ncommit, or support terrorism.  Treasury has possession and control of the records that Plaintiffs \nseek. \n5.  One of Treasury's operating units is the Office of Foreign Assets Control \n(\"OFAC\"), which administers sanctions programs against those determined to have committed, \nthreatened to commit, or support terrorism. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n6.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. ยง 1331 and 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(4)(B). \n7.  Venue is premised on the place of business of Plaintiffs and is proper in \nthis district under 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(4)(B). \n8.  Plaintiffs have exhausted all administrative remedies available in regards \nto the request at issue.  Treasury denied Plaintiffs' timely filed administrative appeal in its \nentirety. \nFACTS \n9.  OFAC administers and enforces a range of sanctions programs against \nindividuals and entities to accomplish various foreign policy and national security goals.  Among \nthese programs are Counter Terrorism Sanctions aimed at those determined to have committed, \nthreatened to commit, or supported terrorism. \n10.  Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Government \nestablished an extensive network of surveillance programs, often without a warrant, intended to \nmonitor and uncover potential terrorist threats. \n2 \n59101 \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05740-ER   Document 1   Filed 07/22/15   Page 3 of 5\n11.  In 2008, some portions of the Government's surveillance programs, \nincluding programs administered by the National Security Agency, were incorporated into the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act (\"FISA\"), 50 U.S.C. ยง 1801 et. seq. \n12.  FISA includes a provision requiring that \"Whenever the Government \nintends to enter into evidence or otherwise use or disclose in any ... proceeding on or before any \n... department ... against an aggrieved person, any information obtained or derived from \nelectronic surveillance of that aggrieved person ... the Government shall, prior to the ... \nproceeding ... notify the aggrieved person\".  50 U .S.C. ยง 1806( c). \n13.  Whether or not FISA's notice provision applied to OFAC terrorism \nsanctions determinations was the subject of intense debate within Treasury and the Department \nof Justice. \n14.  On September 30, 2014, Mr. Savage submitted a FOIA request (the \n\"Request\") to Treasury, seeking disclosure of \"documents showing the legal conclusions \naccepted by the Treasury Department as the governing legal protocol for under what \ncircumstances, if any, and at what stage of the process, FISA's notice provision applies to the \nOffice of Foreign Assets Control sanctioning decisions and challenges to them.\" \n15.  On April 13, 2015, Treasury denied the Request.  Treasury stated that \nOFAC had located one responsive document and that OFAC determined that this document was \nexempt from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(b)(5) because it was protected by the attorney \nclient privilege and the deliberative process privilege. \n16.  On April 16, 2015, Plaintiffs timely filed an administrative appeal with \nTreasury. \n3 \n59101 \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05740-ER   Document 1   Filed 07/22/15   Page 4 of 5\n17.  On May 21, 2015, Treasury denied the administrative appeal in its \nentirety, arguing that the responsive document did not constitute the agency's \"working law,\" \nwhich ordinarily must be disclosed. \nCOUNT \n18.  Plaintiffs repeat, reallege, and reincorporate the allegations in the \nforegoing paragraphs as though fully set forth herein. \n19.  Treasury is an agency subject to FOIA and must therefore release in \nresponse to a FOIA request any disclosable records in its possession at the time of the request \nand provide a lawful reason for withholding any other materials as to which it is claiming an \nexemption. \n20.  Plaintiffs have exhausted all administrative remedies, having filed an \nadministrative appeal, which was denied. \n21.  There is no lawful basis under FOIA for withholding documents asked for \nby the Request. \n22.  Treasury's failure to provide responsive documents violates FOIA. \n23.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs are entitled to an order compelling Treasury to \nproduce the document sought by the Request. \n4 \n59101 \n\nCase 1:15-cv-05740-ER   Document 1   Filed 07/22/15   Page 5 of 5\nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court: \na.  Declare that the documents sought by the Request, as described in the \nforegoing paragraphs, are public under 5 U.S.C. ยง 552 and 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(a) and must be \ndisclosed; \nb.  Order Treasury to provide those records to Plaintiffs within 20 business \ndays of the Court's order; \nc.  Award Plaintiffs the costs of this proceeding, including reasonable \nattorney's fees, as expressly permitted by FOIA; and \nd.  Grant Plaintiffs such other and further relief as this Court deems just and \nproper. \nDated: New York, New York \nJuly 22, 2015 \neremy  utne , E q. \nDavid  .

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT    \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK \n   \nTHE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY and    \nCHARLIE SAVAGE,     \n  OPINION AND ORDER \nPlaintiffs,   \n  15 Civ. 5740 (ER) \n- against - \n \nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF  \nTHE TREASURY,   \n   \nDefendant. \n \n \nRamos, D.J.: \nThe New York Times Company and reporter Charlie Savage (together, โthe Timesโ) \nbring this suit to challenge the response by the Department of the Treasury (โTreasuryโ) to a \nrequest under the Freedom of Information Act (โFOIAโ).  Treasury has moved for summary \njudgment.  The Times opposes the motion and seeks an order from the Court directing Treasury \nto conduct a new search and make available two of its officials for depositions.  For the below \nreasons, Treasuryโs motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.  Treasury is further \ndirected to make additional submissions detailing the search it already performed, but the Court \ndeclines to order a new search or depositions at this time. \nI. BACKGROUND \nA. Factual Background and Prior Proceedings  \nUnder the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (โFISAโ), targets of electronic \nsurveillance are entitled to notice when the Government intends to use surveillance evidence \nagainst them in a legal proceeding.  See 50 U.S.C. ยง 1806(c).  On September 30, 2014, the Times \nsubmitted to Treasury a request under FOIA (the โRequestโ) seeking: \n\n \n[A]ccess to documents showing the legal conclusions accepted by the Treasury \nDepartment as the governing legal protocol for under what circumstances, if any, \nand at what stage of the process, FISAโs notice provision applies to Office of \nForeign Assets Control sanctioning decisions and challenges to them.   \n \nDeclaration of David E. McCraw (โMcCraw Decl.โ) (Doc. 29), Ex. A (โRequestโ).  The Office \nof Foreign Assets Control (โOFACโ) is the unit within Treasury that imposes and administers \neconomic sanctions against foreign entities suspected of engaging in international terrorism.1   \nTreasury FOIA Officer Marshall H. Fields, Jr. (โFieldsโ) responded to the Request on \nApril 13, 2015 (the โFields Replyโ).  See McCraw Decl., Ex. B (โFields Replyโ).  He reported \nthat Treasury had found one thirteen-page memo (the โMemoโ) that was โresponsiveโ to the \nRequest, but that Treasury was withholding the Memo under FOIA Exemption 5, which exempts \nfrom disclosure โinter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be \navailable by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.โ  5 U.S.C. ยง \n552(b)(5).  Fields specifically invoked the attorney-client privilege and the deliberative-process \nprivilege to justify withholding under Exemption 5.  Fields Reply at 1.2 \nThe Times appealed on April 16, 2015 (the โTimes Appealโ).  The Times argued that the \nfact that the Memo was deemed โresponsiveโ to a request for โlegal conclusions accepted by the \nTreasury Department as the governing legal protocolโ necessarily meant that the document \n                                                 \n1 The request arose from Plaintiff Savageโs reporting that the Obama Administration was internally debating the \nextent of Treasuryโs notice obligations under FISA when it uses warrantless surveillance evidence to designate \nforeign terrorists.  See Charlie Savage, Debate Brews Over Disclosing Warrantless Spying, N.Y. TIMES, Oct. 1, \n2014, at A3, available at http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/01/us/debate-simmers-over-disclosing-warrantless-\nspying.html. \n \n2 Exemption 5 authorizes agencies to withhold โdocuments that would be subject to privilege in civil litigation.โ  \nAdamowicz v. I.R.S., 552 F. Supp. 2d 355, 361 (S.D.N.Y. 2008).  โThe deliberative process privilege applies to \ndocuments that are predecisional and deliberative.  A document is predecisional if it is โprepared in order to assist an \nagency decisionmaker in arriving at his decisionโ and deliberative if it is โactually related to the process by which \npolicies are formulated.โโ  N.Y. Times v. U.S. Depโt of Justice, 101 F. Supp. 3d 310, 318 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (quoting \nBrennan Ctr. for Justice at N.Y. Univ. Sch. of Law v. U.S. Depโt of Justice, 697 F.3d 184, 194 (2d Cir. 2012)). \n \n2 \n \n\ncontained Treasuryโs โeffective law and policy,โ i.e., Treasuryโs โworking law,โ and thus must \nbe disclosed.  See McCraw Decl., Ex. C (โTimes Appealโ) at 2โ3.3   \nThe Times Appeal was denied on May 21, 2015 by John E. Smith (โJ. Smithโ), Acting \nDirector of OFAC, and the instant suit was initiated on July 22, 2015.  See McCraw Decl., Ex. D; \nComplaint (Doc. 1).  Because Treasury represented that the Memo was responsive to the \nRequest, the Times opted not to challenge the adequacy of Treasuryโs search, focusing instead \nsolely on the question of whether the Memo was properly withheld under Exemption 5.  See \nJoint Letter (Doc. 13) at 2. \nTreasury moved for summary judgment on December 23, 2015.  (Doc. 17).  In support of \nits motion, Treasury submitted a declaration from Bradley T. Smith (โB. Smithโ), Chief Counsel \nfor Foreign Assets Control at Treasury (the โB. Smith Declarationโ).  See McCraw Decl., Ex. E \n(โB. Smith Decl.โ) ยถ 1.  The B. Smith Declaration explained that the Memo is a โdraft \nmemorandumโ and โdoes not reflect a final legal or policy determination by Treasury,โ and thus \nwas actually not responsive to the โaspectโ of the Request seeking โgoverning legal protocol.โ  \nId. at ยถ 7.  Nevertheless, according to B. Smith, the Memo was deemed responsive under a \nโliberal constructionโ of the Request because the Memo contains โdraft legal analysisโ of the \nspecific topic of OFACโs notice obligations under FISA.  Id.  The B. Smith Declaration further \nstates that the Memo was prepared by โcertain Treasury attorneysโ in advance of a meeting with \n                                                 \n3 A document must be disclosed under FOIA if it includes โan opinion or interpretationโ that โembodies the \nagencyโs effective law and policy,โ in other words, its โworking law.โ  Brennan Ctr., 697 F.3d at 195 (internal \nquotation marks omitted) (quoting N.L.R.B. v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 153 (1975)).  โThe reasons for a \ndecision made by an agencyโ or โa policy actually adoptedโ constitute โโthe working law of the agency.โโ  Id. at 196 \n(quoting Sears, Roebuck, 421 U.S. at 153).  The โworking law analysis is animated by the affirmative provisions of \nFOIA,โ which generally require disclosure of โfinal opinions, statements of policy and interpretations which have \nbeen adopted by the agency, and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public.โ  Id. at 200โ01 (quoting \nSears, Roebuck, 421 U.S. at 153) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Neither the attorney-client privilege nor the \ndeliberative-process privilege can be invoked to justify withholding a document that contains an agencyโs working \nlaw.  See N.Y. Times, 101 F. Supp. 3d at 318โ19 (citations omitted). \n \n3 \n \n\nthe Justice Department โto help frame issues subject to ongoing deliberative discussions,โ and \nmemorialized only โinitial, preliminary advice.โ  Id. at ยถยถ 15โ16.  The declaration also states that \nthe Memo does not contain any working law because it โdoes not have the force and effect of \nlaw within Treasury,โ and because โthe underlying legal analysis and reasoning in the \nmemorandum has not been adopted by Treasuryโ or โused as a reference document by OFAC \npersonnel.โ  Id. at ยถ 16. \n  The Times then moved the Court for permission to take depositions of Fields, J. Smith, \nand B. Smith to better understand the contours of Treasuryโs response.  (Doc. 27).  In opposition, \nTreasury submitted additional declarations from Fields and J. Smith.  (Docs. 34โ36).  The \ndeclaration from Fields explained that he assigned the Request to subject-matter experts \n(โSMEsโ) within OFAC and the Office of Chief Counsel (Foreign Assets Control) (โOCCโ),4 \nwho searched for and produced the Memo, and then recommended that Fields deem the Memo \nresponsive but exempt from disclosure under the attorney-client and deliberative-process \nprivileges.   See Declaration of Marshall H. Fields, Jr. (Doc. 35) ยถยถ 10โ19.  The declaration from \nJ. Smith states that he did not make his own responsiveness determination, but rather only \nreassessed, and ultimately agreed with, the determination to withhold the Memo under \nExemption 5 because it did not contain any working law.  See Declaration of John E. Smith \n(Doc. 36) ยถยถ 10โ11.   \n  The Court denied the Timesโ request for depositions but ordered Treasury to submit an \nadditional declaration from Fields to describe in further detail his own individual basis for \n                                                 \n4 OCC provides โlegal services with respect to the implementation, interpretation, and enforcement of economic \nsanctions programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).โ  Supplemental Declaration of \nBradley T. Smith (Doc. 45) ยถ 2. \n4 \n \n\ndeeming the Memo responsive.  See N.Y. Times Co. v. U.S. Depโt of the Treasury, No. 15 Civ. \n5740 (ER), 2016 WL 1651867, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 26, 2016).  \nB. Proceedings Following the Courtโs April 26, 2016 Order  \nTreasury submitted the supplemental declaration from Fields on May 13, 2016.  See \nSupplemental Declaration of Marshall H. Fields, Jr. (โSupp. Fields Decl.โ) (Doc. 39).  Fields \nexplained that he assigned the Request to OCC because OCC is considered the SME โwith \nrespect to records containing legal equities.โ  Supp. Fields Decl. ยถ 8.  Fields further explained \nthat he โrelied exclusively on OCCโs determination regarding the responsiveness and privileged \nnatureโ of the Memo and did not conduct his own โindependent analysis of the responsiveness of \nthe [Memo].โ  Id. at ยถ 10.  โRather, because of the legal nature of the record, [Fields] relied on \nthe determination of OCC, the SME, that the [Memo] should be treated as responsiveโฆ.โ  Id. \n  The Times submitted its opposition to Treasuryโs motion for summary judgment on May \n26, 2016, but declined to file its own cross-motion for summary judgment, effectively conceding \nthat there was no basis in the evidentiary record to challenge Treasuryโs representations about the \ndeliberative, predecisional nature of the Memo and the resulting withholding of that document.  \nSee Memorandum of Law in Opposition (โNYT Oppโnโ) (Doc. 42) at 8 (โThe Times concedes \nthat without discovery it has no basis for summary judgment as to the Treasury Legal Memo.โ).  \nInstead, accepting Treasuryโs declaration that it did not locate any document containing \nโgoverning legal protocol,โ the Times now challenges the adequacy of Treasuryโs initial search \nand seeks an order from the Court directing Treasury to undertake a new search and produce B. \nSmith and Fields for depositions.  Id. at 8โ9; Letter Motion (โNYT Letterโ) (Doc. 46) at 3.  \n  Treasury objects to this request, arguing first and foremost that the Times both did not \ninclude a challenge to the searchโs adequacy in its complaint and waived that challenge by \n5 \n \n\nfailing to raise it until opposing Treasuryโs summary-judgment motion.  See Defendantโs Reply \n(โGov. Rep.โ) (Doc. 44) at 4โ5.  Treasury also takes the search adequacy issue head on, briefing \nit and submitting an additional declaration from B. Smith (the โSupp. Smith Declarationโ) to \nsubstantiate the adequacy of the search that was performed.  See Supplemental Declaration of \nBradley T. Smith (โSupp. Smith Decl.โ) (Doc. 45); Gov. Rep. at 5โ10. \nII. DISCUSSION \n  This is an unusual FOIA case that has been stymied by miscommunication.  The Times is \nright to say that the Request was crafted unambiguously to reach only working law, and that \nTreasury should have explained from the outset its liberal interpretation of the Request and the \nfact that the Memo did not contain โgoverning legal protocol.โ  That explanation from Treasury, \nwhile now accepted as true by the Times, came late enough in the litigation process that the \nTimesโ failure to challenge the adequacy of the search up to this point is understandable.  On the \nother hand, the Times cannot claim total surprise by Treasuryโs representations in this litigation, \ngiven that Treasury has consistently invoked the deliberative-privilege process and expressly \ndenied the applicability of the working law theory on appealโwhile it was possible that \nTreasury was taking an inherently contradictory position (i.e., arguing that a document \ncontaining โgoverning legal protocolโ did not contain working law), the Times should have been \nquicker to challenge the adequacy of a search that turned up only one document that Treasury \nwas insisting to be predecisional and deliberative, and not working law.   \nAll things considered, and assessing the potential prejudice to both sides, the Court in its \ndiscretion will consider the Timesโ challenge to the searchโs adequacy on the merits.  Cf. \nBooking v. Gen. Star Mgmt. Co., 254 F.3d 414, 418 (2d Cir. 2001). \n6 \n \n\nโIn order to prevail on a motion for summary judgment in a FOIA case, the defending \nagency has the burden of showing that its search was adequateโฆ.โ  Carney v. U.S. Depโt of \nJustice, 19 F.3d 807, 812 (2d Cir. 1994) (citations omitted).  If โthe record leaves substantial \ndoubt as to the sufficiency of the search, summary judgment for the agency is not proper.โ  N.Y. \nTimes Co. v. U.S. Depโt of Def., 499 F. Supp. 2d 501, 517 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (quoting Campbell v. \nU.S. Depโt of Justice, 164 F.3d 20, 27 (D.C. Cir. 1998)). \nโAn agencyโs search is adequate when it is โreasonably calculated to uncover all relevant \ndocumentsโ and the agency can โdemonstrate beyond material doubt that the search was \nreasonable.โโ  Natโl Immigration Project of the Nat. Lawyers Guild v. U.S. Depโt of Homeland \nSec., No. 11 Civ. 3235 (JSR), 2012 WL 6809301, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 27, 2012) (quoting Truitt \nv. Depโt of State, 897 F.2d 540, 542 (D.C. Cir. 1990)).  โ[W]hen a plaintiff questions the \nadequacy of the search an agency made in order to satisfy its FOIA request, the factual question \nit raises is whether the search was reasonably calculated to discover the requested documents, \nnot whether it actually uncovered every document extant.โ  Grand Cent. Pโship, Inc. v. Cuomo, \n166 F.3d 473, 489 (2d Cir. 1999) (quoting SafeCard Servs., Inc. v. SEC, 926 F.2d 1197, 1201 \n(D.C. Cir. 1991)) (internal quotation marks omitted).  โUnder this standard, the relevant question \nโis not whether there might exist any other documents possibly responsive to the request, but \nrather whether the search for those documents was adequateโ under the particular circumstances \nof the case.โ  Bloomgarden v. U.S. Depโt of Justice, 10 F. Supp. 3d 146, 152 (D.D.C. 2014) \n(quoting Weisberg v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 745 F.2d 1476, 1485 (D.C. Cir. 1984)).   \nโAffidavits or declarations supplying facts indicating that the agency has conducted a \nthorough searchโฆare sufficient to sustain the agencyโs burdenโ and โare accorded a presumption \nof good faith.โ  Long v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., 692 F.3d 185, 190โ91 (2d Cir. 2012) (quoting \n7 \n \n\nCarney, 19 F.3d at 812) (internal quotation marks omitted).  In its submissions, an agency must \nโidentify the searched files and describe at least generally the structure of the agencyโs file \nsystem,โ explain why โfurther search[es] [are] unlikely to disclose additional relevant \ninformation,โ establish that โthey searched all custodians who were reasonably likely to possess \nresponsive documents,โ and set forth โthe search terms and the type of search performed.โ  Natโl \nDay Laborer Org. Network v. U.S. Immigration & Customs Enfโt Agency, 877 F. Supp. 2d 87, 96 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2012) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); see also, e.g., Oglesby v. U.S. \nDepโt of Army, 920 F.2d 57, 68 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (โA reasonably detailed affidavit, setting forth \nthe search terms and the type of search performed, and averring that all files likely to contain \nresponsive materials (if such records exist) were searched, is necessary to afford a FOIA \nrequester an opportunity to challenge the adequacy of the search and to allow the district court to \ndetermine if the search was adequate in order to grant summary judgment.โ); Natโl Immigration \nProject, 2012 WL 6809301, at *4 (โAn agencyโs affidavits or declarations should set forth the \nsearch terms and the type of search performedโฆ.[and must] supply more than glib government \nassertions of complete disclosure or retrieval.โ) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \n  The Supp. Smith Declaration describes Treasuryโs search in response to the Request.  It \nfirst explains that OFACโs FOIA office initially assigned the search to OCC plus four other \nindividuals within OFACโthe Director, the Deputy Director, the Associate Director in the \nOffice of Global Targeting, and an Administrative Management Specialist for assistance \nsearching the emails of OFACโs former Deputy Director.  Supp. Smith Decl. ยถ 6.  From there, \nโbased on the narrow legal issue raised,โ OCC determined that only two OCC attorneys could \nhave records โpotentially responsiveโ to the RequestโB. Smith himself, and โone other \nattorney.โ  Supp. Smith Decl. ยถ 7.  B. Smith conducted a search of his emails, paper files, and \n8 \n \n\ncomputer files.  Id. at ยถ 8.  The other OCC attorney โhad been working on FISA issues in [OCC] \nfor several years, and was familiar with the FISA-related records in his possession as well as \ncertain records maintained by [OCC] based on recent searches that he had performed in \nconnection with this work.โ  Id. at ยถ 9.  Accordingly, this other attorney โwas able to provide a \nresponse to the FOIA request without conducting an additional physical or electronic search of \nhis records,โ identifying the Memo as the only โpotentially responsive document,โ even under a \nliberal interpretation of the Request.  Id. at ยถยถ 9โ10.  The declaration further represents that OCC \nโwould have been aware of and involved in the draftingโ of any documents or โgoverning legal \nprotocolโ regarding the applicability of FISAโs notice provisions to OFACโs sanctioning \ndecisions.  Id. at ยถ 11.  Thus, โbased on the subject matterโ of the Request and OCCโs \nโfamiliarity with those in Treasury who had been engaged on the issue,โ B. Smith and his \ncolleague determined that no one else in OFAC would have any other potentially responsive \ndocuments, nor was B. Smith aware of the existence of any such documents, which he attests he \nwould have been if such documents had existed, โgiven the important legal questions involved.โ  \nId. at ยถยถ 12โ13.  Finally, B. Smith reconfirmed that OCC would have determined that no \nresponsive documents existed if the Request had been strictly construed to reach only Treasuryโs \nโgoverning legal protocol.โ  Id. at ยถ 15. \n  In requesting a new search and depositions, the Times does not argue that Treasuryโs \nrepresentations are untruthful or made in bad faith, but only that they are incomplete.  NYT \nLetter at 2.  Specifically, the Times questions (i) the other OCC attorneyโs failure to conduct an \nactual search, (ii) the absence of information regarding results of the searches done by the four \nindividual OFAC officials, (iii) the lack of details about the meeting for which the Memo was \nprepared and whether such deliberations are ongoing, which โcould help explain why no further \n9 \n \n\ndocuments were turned up,โ and (iv) the absence of information regarding โwhether OFAC \nofficials took notes or created memos to file or sent a confirming email to memorialize what was \nsaid.โ  Id. at 2โ3.   \n  The Court agrees with the Times to the following extent:  Treasuryโs submissions thus far \ndo not demonstrate bad faith or lack of truthfulness, but there does remain a genuine issue of \nmaterial fact as to whether the search already completed was adequate.  In other words, \nTreasuryโs submissions are insufficiently detailed as they stand, but the Times has not \ndemonstrated a need for a new search or depositions, at least at this stage.   \nTreasury is thus instructed to submit further affidavits or declarations describing the \nadequacy of its prior search.  See Beltranena v. Clinton, 770 F. Supp. 2d 175, 187 (D.D.C. 2011) \n(โ[W]hereโas hereโโan agencyโs affidavits regarding its search are deficient, courts generally \ndo not grant discovery but instead direct the agency to supplement its affidavits.โโ) (quoting \nJarvik v. C.I.A., 741 F. Supp. 2d 106, 122 (D.D.C. 2010)).  Specifically, the Court requires more \ndetails as to the kinds of information and files housed within OCC, why the choice of custodians \nwas reasonable, why certain record repositories were searched while others were not, and the \nsearch terms that were employed.  See generally, e.g., Vietnam Veterans of Am. Connecticut \nGreater Hartford Chapter 120 v. Depโt of Homeland Sec., 8 F. Supp. 3d 188, 227 (D. Conn. \n2014); Natโl Sec. Counselors v. C.I.A., 960 F. Supp. 2d 101, 152โ54 (D.D.C. 2013).  Regarding \nthe four specific issues that the Times raises (listed above), the first two go to the adequacy of \nthe search, and Treasury should address these issues in its supplemental submissions.5  But the \n                                                 \n5 Treasury argues that an agency officialโs preexisting familiarity with the scope and content of records may excuse \nperformance of a new search in response to a FOIA request.  See Letter Response (Doc. 47) at 2โ3.  But even if that \nwere so, here the Court has no specific information about the other OCC attorneyโs knowledge, records, or prior \nsearches, including the types of records previously searched and the search terms used.  It may be that the OCC \nattorney was justified in not engaging in a new search in response to the Request because the attorney had recently \nundertaken an adequate search reasonably calculated to discover legal protocol governing FISAโs application to \nsanctioning decisions, but the Court cannot determine as much on the present record.  Alternatively, rather than \n10 \n \n\n",
