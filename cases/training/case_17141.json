    "summary": "<p>In 2018, President Trump repeatedly requested Congress appropriate 5.7 billion dollars for the construction of a southern border wall. On February 14th, 2019, Congress denied this request and appropriated only 1.375 billion dollars for the construction of a strip of border fencing. While President Trump signed this appropriations bill the following day, he simultaneously declared a national emergency under the National Emergencies Act (NEA) and directed the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security to reallocate funds already appropriated by Congress for military operations and projects to the construction of the southern border wall.

Congress has the exclusive authority to appropriate funds.

TRUMP, in his official  ORDER \ncapacity as President of the United States; et \nal.,  \n  \n          Defendants-Appellants. \n \nBefore:  CLIFTON, N.R. SMITH, and FRIEDLAND, Circuit Judges. \n \nOrder by Judges Clifton and Friedland \nDissent by Judge N.R. Smith \nCLIFTON and FRIEDLAND, Circuit Judges: \nThis emergency proceeding arises from a challenge to a decision by the \nPresident and certain of his cabinet members (collectively, “Defendants”)1 to \n                                           \n1 When federal officials are parties to litigation, we usually refer to them \ncollectively as “the Government.”  That terminology seems inapt in this \nproceeding given that the question before us is whether the Executive Branch of \nthe federal government is attempting to exercise authority that is allocated by the \nConstitution to the Legislative Branch of the federal government, and whether the \nExecutive Branch is doing so without authorization from the Legislative Branch.  \n \n        \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 2 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 2 of 105\n“reprogram” funds appropriated by Congress to the Department of Defense \n(“DoD”) for Army personnel needs and to redirect those funds toward building a \nbarrier along portions of our country’s southern border.   \nThis reprogramming decision was made after President Trump had \nrepeatedly sought appropriations from Congress for the construction of a border \nbarrier.  Although Congress provided some funding for those purposes, it \nconsistently refused to pass any measures that met the President’s desired funding \nlevel, creating a standoff that led to a 35-day partial government shutdown.  The \nPresident signed the budget legislation that ended the shutdown, but he then \ndeclared a national emergency and pursued other means to get additional funding \nfor border barrier construction beyond what Congress had appropriated.  One of \nthose means, and the one at issue in this emergency request for a stay, was a \nreprogramming of funds by DoD in response to a request by the Department of \nHomeland Security (“DHS”). \nSpecifically, DoD relied on section 8005 of the Department of Defense \nAppropriations Act of 2019 and related provisions to reprogram approximately \n$2.5 billion, moving the funds from DoD to DHS, for the purpose of building \n                                           \nAnd the House of Representatives, which is part of the Legislative Branch, has \nfiled an amicus brief opposing the Executive Branch’s position.  To avoid \nconfusion, we therefore refer to the President and the cabinet members sued here \ncollectively as “Defendants.” \n   2     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 3 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 3 of 105\nborder barriers in certain locations within Arizona, California, and New Mexico.  \nSection 8005 authorizes the Secretary of Defense to transfer funds for military \npurposes if the Secretary determines that the transfer is “for higher priority items, \nbased on unforeseen military requirements” and “the item for which funds are \nrequested has [not] been denied by the Congress.”  Pub. L. No. 115-245, § 8005, \n132 Stat. 2981, 2999 (2018) (hereinafter “section 8005”). \nThe Sierra Club and the Southern Border Communities Coalition \n(collectively, “Plaintiffs”) sued Defendants to enjoin the reprogramming and the \nfunds’ expenditure.  They argued that the requirements of section 8005 had not \nbeen satisfied and that the use of the funds to build a border barrier was \naccordingly unsupported by any congressional appropriation and thus \nunconstitutional.  A federal district court agreed with Plaintiffs and enjoined \nDefendants from using reprogrammed funds to construct a border barrier.  \nDefendants now move for an emergency stay of the district court’s injunction.  \nTo rule on Defendants’ motion, we consider several factors, including \nwhether Defendants have shown that they are likely to succeed on the merits of \ntheir appeal, the degree of hardship to each side that would result from a stay or its \ndenial, and the public interest in granting or denying a stay.   \nWe conclude, first, that Defendants are not likely to succeed on the merits of \ntheir appeal.  The Appropriations Clause of the Constitution provides that “No \n   3     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 4 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 4 of 105\nMoney shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations \nmade by Law.”  U.S. Const. art I., § 9, cl. 7.  Defendants assert that, through \nsection 8005, Congress authorized DoD to reprogram the funds at issue.  We agree \nwith Plaintiffs, however, that the requirements of section 8005 have not been met.  \nSpecifically, the need for which the funds were reprogrammed was not \n“unforeseen,” and it was an item for which funds were previously “denied by the \nCongress.”  Defendants do not argue that their contrary interpretation of section \n8005 is entitled to any form of administrative deference, and we hold that no such \ndeference would be appropriate in any event.   \nBecause section 8005 did not authorize DoD to reprogram the funds—and \nDefendants do not and cannot argue that any other statutory or constitutional \nprovision authorized the reprogramming—the use of those funds violates the \nconstitutional requirement that the Executive Branch not spend money absent an \nappropriation from Congress.   \nDefendants contend that these Plaintiffs are unlikely to prevail because they \nlack a cause of action through which to challenge the reprogramming.  We \ndisagree.  Plaintiffs either have an equitable cause of action to enjoin a \nconstitutional violation, or they can proceed on their constitutional claims under \nthe Administrative Procedure Act, or both.  To the extent any zone of interests test \n   4     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 5 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 5 of 105\nwere to apply to Plaintiffs’ constitutional claims, we hold that it would be satisfied \nhere.   \nConsidering the remaining factors relevant to Defendants’ request for a \nstay—the degree of hardship that may result from a stay or its denial, and the \npublic interest at stake—we are not persuaded that a stay should be entered.  There \nis a strong likelihood that Plaintiffs will prevail in this litigation, and Defendants \nhave a correspondingly low likelihood of success on appeal.  As for the public \ninterest, we conclude that it is best served by respecting the Constitution’s \nassignment of the power of the purse to Congress, and by deferring to Congress’s \nunderstanding of the public interest as reflected in its repeated denial of more \nfunding for border barrier construction.  We therefore hold that a stay of the district \ncourt’s order granting Plaintiffs an injunction is not warranted. \nI.  Factual & Procedural Background \nPresident Trump has made numerous requests to Congress for funding for \nconstruction of a barrier on the U.S.-Mexico border.  In his proposed budget for \nFiscal Year 2018, for example, the President requested $2.6 billion for border \nsecurity, including “funding to plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the \nsouthern border.”  Office of Mgmt. & Budget, Exec. Office of the President, \nBudget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 2018, at 18 (2017).  Congress \npartially obliged, allocating in the 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act $1.571 \n   5     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 6 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 6 of 105\nbillion for border fencing, “border barrier planning and design,” and the \n“acquisition and deployment of border security technology.”  Consolidated \nAppropriations Act, 2018, Pub. L. No. 115-141, div. F, tit. II, § 230(a), 132 Stat. \n348, 616 (2018).  Throughout 2018, House and Senate lawmakers introduced \nnumerous bills that would have authorized or appropriated additional billions for \nborder barrier construction.  Specifically, Congress considered and rejected the \nSecuring America’s Future Act of 2018, H.R. 4760, 115th Cong. § 1111 (2018) \n(instructing the Secretary of Homeland Security to take necessary actions to build a \nphysical barrier on the southern border); the Border Security and Immigration \nReform Act of 2018, H.R. 6136, 115th Cong. § 5101 (2018) (appropriating \n$16.625 billion for a border wall); the American Border Act, H.R. 6415, 115th \nCong. § 4101 (2018) (same); the Fund and Complete the Border Wall Act, H.R. \n6657, 115th Cong. § 2 (2018) (creating a “Secure the Southern Border Fund” for \nappropriations for border barrier construction); the Build the Wall, Enforce the \nLaw Act of 2018, H.R. 7059, 115th Cong. § 9 (2018) (again, appropriating \n$16.625 billion for a “border wall system”); the 50 Votes for the Wall Act, H.R. \n7073, 115th Cong. § 2 (2018) (establishing a “Border Wall and Security Trust \nFund” of up to $25 billion to “construct a wall (including physical barriers and \nassociated detection technology, roads, and lighting)” along the U.S.-Mexico \nborder); and the WALL Act of 2018, S. 3713, 115th Cong. § 2 (2018) \n   6     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 7 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 7 of 105\n(appropriating $25 billion for the construction of a border wall).  Lawmakers spent \ncountless hours considering these various proposals, but none ultimately passed. \nThe situation reached an impasse in December 2018.  During negotiations \nwith Congress over an appropriations bill to fund various parts of the federal \ngovernment for the remainder of the fiscal year, the President announced his \nunequivocal position that “any measure that funds the government must include \nborder security.”  C-SPAN, Farm Bill Signing (Dec. 20, 2018), https://www.c-\nspan.org/video/?456189-1/president-government-funding-bill-include-money-\nborder-wall.  He declared that he would not sign any funding bill that did not \nallocate substantial funding for a physical barrier on the U.S.-Mexico border.  \nErica Werner et al., Trump Says He Won’t Sign Senate Deal to Avert Shutdown, \nDemands Funds for Border Security, Wash. Post (Dec. 21, 2018), \nhttps://wapo.st/2EIpkHu?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.6e7c259f6857 (“Werner et al.”).  \nThe President also stated that he was willing to declare a national emergency and \nuse other mechanisms to get the money he desired if Congress refused to allocate \nit.  Remarks by President Trump in Meeting with Senate Minority Leader Chuck \nSchumer and House Speaker-Designate Nancy Pelosi, The White House (Dec. 11, \n2018, 11:40 A.M.), https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-\npresident-trump-meeting-senate-minority-leader-chuck-schumer-house-speaker-\ndesignate-nancy-pelosi/.  On December 20, 2018, the House of Representatives \n   7     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 8 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 8 of 105\npassed a continuing resolution that allocated $5.7 billion in border barrier funding.  \nH.R. 695, 115th Cong. § 141 (2018) (“[T]here is appropriated for ‘U.S. Customs \nand Border Protection—Procurement, Construction, and Improvements’ \n$5,710,357,000 for fiscal year 2019.”).  But the Senate rejected the bill.  The \nPresident could not reach an agreement with lawmakers on whether the spending \nbill would include border barrier funding, triggering what would become the \nnation’s longest partial government shutdown.  Werner et al., supra; Mihir Zaveri \net al., The Government Shutdown Was the Longest Ever.  Here’s the History., N.Y. \nTimes (Jan. 25, 2019), https://nyti.ms/2RATHG9.   \nOn January 6, 2019, during the shutdown, the President “request[ed] $5.7 \nbillion for construction of a steel barrier for the Southwest border” in a letter to the \nSenate Committee on Appropriations, explaining that the request “would fund \nconstruction of a total of approximately 234 miles of new physical barrier,” \nincluding in the top ten priority areas in the Border Security Improvement Plan \ncreated by Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”).  Letter from Russell T. \nVought, Acting Dir. of the Office of Mgmt. and Budget, to Richard Shelby, \nChairman of the Senate Comm. on Appropriations (Jan. 6, 2019).  This represented \na $4.1 billion increase over the President’s February 2018 request for $1.6 billion \nfor the Fiscal Year 2019 budget, which had been for the construction of “65 miles \n   8     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 9 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 9 of 105\nof border wall in south Texas.”  Office of Mgmt. & Budget, Exec. Office of the \nPresident, Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2019, 58 (2018).   \nAfter 35 days, the government shutdown ended without an agreement \nproviding increased border barrier funding.  Remarks Delivered by President \nTrump on the Government Shutdown (Jan. 25, 2019), \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-\ngovernment-shutdown/.  Congress passed and the President signed a stopgap \nspending measure to reopen for three weeks the parts of the Government that had \nbeen shut down.  H.R.J. Res. 28, 116th Cong. (2019).  But the President made clear \nthat he still intended to build a border barrier, with or without funding from \nCongress.  As the Acting White House Chief of Staff explained, the President was \nprepared to both reprogram money and declare a national emergency to obtain a \ntotal sum “well north of $5.7 billion.”  Gregg Re, Border Wall Talks Break Down \nAhead of Second Possible Government Shutdown, Fox News (Feb. 10, 2019), \nhttps://fxn.ws/2SmNK0I.  \nCongress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019 (“CAA”) on \nFebruary 14, 2019, which included the Department of Homeland Security \nAppropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2019.  Pub. L. No. 116-6, div. A, 133 Stat. 13 \n(2019).  The CAA appropriated only $1.375 billion of the $5.7 billion the President \nhad sought in border barrier funding and specified that the $1.375 billion was “for \n   9     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 10 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 10 of 105\nthe construction of primary pedestrian fencing . . . in the Rio Grande Valley \nSector.”  Id. § 230(a)(1), 133 Stat. at 28.  Congress also imposed several \nlimitations on the use of those funds, including by not allowing construction within \ncertain wildlife refuges and parks.  Id. § 231, 133 Stat. at 28.   \nThe President signed the CAA into law the following day.  Statement by the \nPresident, The White House (Feb. 15, 2019), \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-by-the-president-28/.  \nHe concurrently issued a proclamation under the National Emergencies Act, 50 \nU.S.C. §§ 1601-1651, “declar[ing] that a national emergency exists at the southern \nborder of the United States.” Proclamation No. 9844, 84 Fed. Reg. 4949 (Feb. 15, \n2019) (“Proclamation No. 9844”).   \nProclamation No. 9844 described “a border security and humanitarian crisis \nthat threatens core national security interests” because the border served as a major \nentry point for criminals, gang members, and illicit narcotics and the number of \nfamily units entering the United States had recently increased.  Id.  It declared that \nthis “emergency situation” necessitated support from the Armed Forces.  Id.  The \nproclamation made available to DoD “the construction authority provided in” 10 \nU.S.C. § 2808, which is limited to presidential declarations “that require[] use of \nthe armed forces,” id. § 2808(a).  \n   10     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 11 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 11 of 105\nAn accompanying White House Fact Sheet explained that the President was \n“using his legal authority to take Executive action to secure additional resources” \nto build a border barrier.  President Donald J. Trump’s Border Security Victory, \nThe White House (Feb. 15, 2019), https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-\nstatements/president-donald-j-trumps-border-security-victory/.  It continued: \n“Including funding in Homeland Security appropriations, the Administration has \nso far identified up to $8.1 billion that will be available to build the border wall \nonce a national emergency is declared and additional funds have been \nreprogrammed.”  Id.  The fact sheet specifically identified three funding sources: \n(1) “[a]bout $601 million from the Treasury Forfeiture Fund,” 31 U.S.C. \n§ 9705(a); (2) “[u]p to $2.5 billion under the Department of Defense \n[reprogrammed] funds transferred [to DHS] for Support for Counterdrug \nActivities” pursuant to 10 U.S.C. § 284 (“section 284”);2 and (3) “[u]p to $3.6 \nbillion reallocated from [DoD] military construction projects under the President’s \n                                           \n2 Title 10, Chapter 15 of the U.S. Code describes various forms of military \nsupport for civilian law enforcement agencies.  Within that chapter, section 284 \nauthorizes the Secretary of Defense to “provide support for the counterdrug \nactivities . . . of any other department or agency of the Federal Government” if it \nreceives a request from “the official who has responsibility for the counterdrug \nactivities.”  10 U.S.C. §§ 284(a), 284(a)(1)(A).  The statute permits, among other \nthings, support for “[c]onstruction of roads and fences and installation of lighting \nto block drug smuggling corridors across international boundaries of the United \nStates.”  Id. § 284(b)(7).  DoD’s provision of support for other agencies pursuant to \nsection 284 does not require the declaration of a national emergency. \n \n   11     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 12 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 12 of 105\ndeclaration of a national emergency” pursuant to 10 U.S.C. § 2808 (“section \n2808”), which provides that the Secretary of Defense may authorize military \nconstruction projects whenever the President declares a national emergency that \nrequires use of the armed forces.  Id.   \nThe House and Senate adopted a joint resolution terminating the President’s \ndeclaration of a national emergency pursuant to Congress’s authority under 50 \nU.S.C. § 1622(a)(1).  H.R.J. Res. 46, 116th Cong. (2019).  The President vetoed \nthe joint resolution, Veto Message to the House of Representatives for H.J. Res. 46, \nThe White House (Mar. 15, 2019), https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-\nstatements/veto-message-house-representatives-h-j-res-46/, and a vote in the House \nto override the veto fell short of the required two-thirds majority, 165 Cong. Rec. \nH2799, H2814-15 (2019). \nAlmost immediately, executive branch agencies began to use the funds \nidentified in Proclamation 9844 for border barrier construction.  The same day the \nPresident issued the proclamation, the Department of the Treasury approved \nDHS’s December 2018 request to use treasury forfeiture funds to enhance border \nsecurity infrastructure, providing up to $601 million in funding.3  Letter from \n                                           \n3 The three funding sources the White House had identified were to “be used \nsequentially and as needed.”  President Donald J. Trump’s Border Security \nVictory, The White House (Feb. 15, 2019).  In other words, the government first \nbegan spending the treasury forfeiture funds, followed by DoD funding \n \n   12     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 13 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 13 of 105\nDavid F. Eisner, Assistant Sec’y for Mgmt., U.S. Dep’t of the Treasury, to the \nHouse and Senate Appropriations Comms.’ Subcomms. on Fin. Servs. & Gen. \nGov’t (Feb. 15, 2019).  Then, on February 25, DHS submitted a request to DoD for \nassistance, pursuant to section 284, with construction of fences, roads, and lighting \nwithin eleven drug-smuggling corridors identified by DHS along the border.  \nMemorandum re: Request for Assistance Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. § 284 from \nChristina Bobb, Exec. Sec’y, DHS, to Capt. Hallock N. Mohler, Jr., Exec. Sec’y, \nDoD, (Feb. 25, 2019).  In response to that request, on March 25, the Acting \nSecretary of Defense, Patrick Shanahan, approved the transfer of up to $1 billion in \nfunds from DoD to DHS for the three highest priority drug-smuggling corridors: \nthe Yuma Sector Project 1 and Yuma Sector Project 2 in Arizona, and the El Paso \nSector Project 1 in New Mexico.4  Letter from Patrick M. Shanahan, Acting Sec’y \nof Def., DoD, to Kirstjen Nielsen, Sec’y of Homeland Sec., DHS (Mar. 25, 2019).  \nTo fund the approved projects, Shanahan invoked section 8005 of the \nDepartment of Defense Appropriations Act of 2019 and section 1001 of the John \nS. McCain National Defense Authorization Act (“NDAA”) for Fiscal Year 2019 to \n“reprogram” approximately $1 billion from Army personnel funds to the \n                                           \nreprogrammed under section 8005 and transferred to DHS pursuant to section 284, \nand finally military construction funds reallocated under section 2808. \n4 The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which is tasked with initial project \nscoping and construction, has since decided not to fund or construct Yuma Project \n2 under § 284. \n   13     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 14 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 14 of 105\ncounter-narcotics support budget, which Shanahan asserted then made those funds \navailable for transfer to DHS pursuant to section 284.  Section 8005 authorizes the \nSecretary of Defense to transfer up to $4 billion “of working capital funds of the \nDepartment of Defense or funds made available in this Act to the Department of \nDefense for military functions (except military construction).”  The Secretary must \nfirst determine that “such action is necessary in the national interest” and obtain \napproval from the White House Office of Management and Budget.  Section 8005 \nfurther provides that the authority to transfer may only be used “for higher priority \nitems, based on unforeseen military requirements, than those for which originally \nappropriated and in no case where the item for which funds are requested has been \ndenied by the Congress.”5  It also imposes a “prompt[]” congressional notification \nrequirement for all transfers made under its authority.  Reprogramming of funds \nunder section 8005 does not require the declaration of a national emergency.   \nA memo from Shanahan asserted that the statutory requirements for \nreprogramming under section 8005 had been met: that the items to be funded were \na higher priority than the Army personnel funds; that the need to provide support \nfor the Yuma and El Paso Projects was “an unforeseen military requirement not \n                                           \n5 Equivalent language restricting the circumstances in which reprogramming \nis permitted has been included in defense appropriations statutes since 1974.  See \nPub. L. No. 93-238, § 735, 87 Stat. 1026, 1044 (1974); H.R. Rep.

Shanahan, \nActing Sec’y of Def., DoD, to Under Sec’y of Def. (Comptroller)/Chief Fin. \nOfficer (Mar. 25, 2019).  Specifically, DoD concluded that “Army personnel funds \nwere available for transfer because expenditures for service member pay and \ncompensation, retirements benefits, food, and moving expenses through the end of \nfiscal year 2019 [would] be lower than originally budgeted.”  As required by \nsection 8005, Shanahan also formally notified Congress of the reprogramming \nauthorization, explaining that the reprogrammed funds were “required” so that \nDoD could provide DHS the support it requested under section 284.6 \nThe next day, both the House Committee on Armed Services and the House \nCommittee on Appropriations formally disapproved of DoD’s section 8005 \nreprogramming.  The Armed Services Committee wrote in a letter to DoD that it \n“denie[d] this [reprogramming] request,” and that the committee “[did] not \napprove the proposed use of Department of Defense funds to construct additional \n                                           \n6 DoD had previously adhered to a “gentlemen’s agreement” with Congress \nwhere it sought approval from the relevant committees before reprogramming \nfunds, rather than simply notifying them after the decision had been finalized.  \nHouse Armed Services Committee Holds Hearing on Fiscal 2020 Defense \nAuthorization, CQ Cong.

Visclosky, Chairman of \nthe Def. Subcomm. of the U.S. House of Representatives Comm. on \nAppropriations (Mar. 26, 2019). \nOfficials at DoD and DHS pressed forward with reprogramming-enabled \nborder barrier construction plans.  In early April, DoD awarded contracts for work \nin the Yuma and El Paso Project areas, and the agencies began environmental \nplanning and consultation.  Contracts for Apr. 9, 2019, U.S. Dep’t of Def. (Apr. 9, \n2019), https://dod.defense.gov/News/Contracts/Contract-View/Article/1809986/.  \nMeanwhile, Shanahan reported on May 8 that DoD and DHS had secured \nfunding for DHS to build about 256 miles of border barrier using both treasury \nforfeiture funds and reprogrammed monies.

DoD also reported selecting twelve companies to \ncompete for up to $5 billion worth of border barrier construction contracts.  \nContracts for May 8, 2019, U.S. Dep’t of Def.

On May \n9, Shanahan invoked section 8005 and section 1001 of the NDAA again—along \nwith related reprogramming provisions, section 9002 of the Department of Defense \nAppropriations Act of 2019 and section 1512 of the NDAA7—to authorize an \nadditional $1.5 billion in reprogramming to fund four more projects.  \nMemorandum re: Additional Support to the Dep’t of Homeland Security from \nPatrick M. Shanahan, Acting Sec’y of Def., DoD (May 9, 2019).  The new \nprojects, El Centro Project 1 and Tucson Sector Projects 1, 2, and 3, are located in \nCalifornia and Arizona.  Around the same time, the President indicated that he \nexpected to approve additional projects using funds authorized by the national \nemergency declaration pursuant to section 2808, although no concrete action has \n                                           \n7 Section 9002 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2019 \nauthorizes the Secretary of Defense to transfer up to $2 billion between the \nappropriations or funds made available to DoD if he determines “that such action is \nnecessary in the national interest” and obtains approval from the Office of \nManagement and Budget.  Pub. L. No. 115-245, § 9002, 132 Stat 2981, 3042 \n(2018).  Section 9002 “is subject to the same terms and conditions as the authority \nprovided in section 8005.”  Id.  Section 1512 of the NDAA likewise provides a \nspecial transfer authority for up to $3.5 billion upon determination that it is \n“necessary in the national interest,” and, under section 1001 of the NDAA, is \nsubject to identical terms and conditions as 8005.  Pub. L. No. 115-232, § 1512, \n132 Stat. 1636, 2096 (2018).  Because it is uncontested that all of these \nreprogramming provisions are subject to section 8005’s requirements, we refer to \nthese requirements collectively by reference to section 8005.

See White House Memorandum on Sequencing of \nBorder Barrier Construction Authorities (Mar. 4, 2019). \n  On February 19, 2019, the Sierra Club and Southern Border Communities \nCoalition filed a lawsuit against Donald J. Trump, in his official capacity as \nPresident of the United States; Patrick M. Shanahan, in his official capacity as \nActing Secretary of Defense; Kirstjen M. Nielsen, in her official capacity as \nSecretary of Homeland Security; and Steven Mnuchin, in his official capacity as \nSecretary of the Treasury (collectively, “Defendants,” see supra n.1).8  This \nlawsuit followed closely on the heels of a related action brought by a coalition of \nstates against the same group of Defendants and others. \n  Plaintiffs are two nonprofit organizations who sued on behalf of themselves \nand their members.  The Sierra Club is dedicated to enjoyment of the outdoors and \nenvironmental protection, and it engages in advocacy and public education on \nissues such as habitat destruction, land use, and the human and environmental \nimpact of construction projects, including the proposed construction of the border \nbarrier.  SBCC is a program of Alliance San Diego that brings together \norganizations from California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas to promote \n                                           \n8 The current Acting Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper, has been \nautomatically substituted for Shanahan.  The current Acting Secretary of \nHomeland Security, Kevin K. McAleenan, has been automatically substituted for \nNielsen. \n   18     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 19 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 19 of 105\npolicies aimed at improving the quality of life in border communities, including \nborder enforcement and immigration reform policies.  \nPlaintiffs’ operative Complaint alleges that Defendants exceeded the scope \nof their constitutional and statutory authority by spending money in excess of what \nCongress allocated for border security; that Defendants’ actions violated separation \nof powers principles as well as the Appropriations Clause and Presentment Clause \nof the Constitution; and that Defendants failed to comply with the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act (“NEPA”), 42 U.S.C. § 4321 et seq.  Plaintiffs also \nallege that Defendants are acting ultra vires (without authority) in seeking to divert \nfunding without statutory authority to do so.   \nPlaintiffs allege that Defendants’ use of the reprogrammed funds would \ninjure their members because the noise of construction, additional personnel, visual \nblight, and negative ecological effects that would accompany a border barrier and \nits construction would detract from their ability to hike, fish, enjoy the desert \nlandscapes, and observe and study a diverse range of wildlife in areas near the \nU.S.-Mexico border.  Plaintiffs also allege that they participated in the legislative \nprocess by “devot[ing] substantial staff and other resources towards legislative \nadvocacy leading up to the appropriations bill passed by Congress in February \n2019, specifically directed towards securing Congress’s denial of substantial \nfunding to the border wall.”  The Complaint requests declaratory and permanent \n   19     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 20 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 20 of 105\ninjunctive relief to prevent construction of the border barrier using the funding at \nissue in the lawsuit.  \n  On April 4, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, asking the \ndistrict court to enter a “preliminary injunction prohibiting Defendants and all \npersons associated with them from taking action to build a border wall using funds \nor resources from the Defense Department; and specifically enjoining construction \nof the wall segments in the . . . ‘Yuma Sector Projects 1 and 2 and El Paso Sector \nProject 1 [areas].’”  In particular, Plaintiffs moved to enjoin Defendants from using \nDoD’s reprogramming authority in section 8005 to transfer funds from Army \npersonnel into the counterdrug appropriations line, from subsequently using \nsection 284 to divert those funds from DoD’s counterdrug appropriations line to be \nused by DHS for border barrier construction, from invoking section 2808 to divert \nfunds appropriated to military construction projects, and from taking any further \naction before complying with NEPA’s procedural requirements.  Plaintiffs argued \nthat a preliminary injunction was necessary because Defendants had already \ndiverted funds, and that Plaintiffs would be irreparably harmed if Defendants \nproceeded with their threatened construction during the pendency of the district \ncourt proceedings.  After receiving briefing from both sides, the district court held \na multiple-hour hearing on May 17, 2019.  \n   20     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 21 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 21 of 105\nOn May 24, the district court issued an order granting the motion in part and \ndenying it in part.  Sierra Club v. Trump, No. 4:19-cv-00892-HSG, 2019 WL \n2247689 (N.D. Cal. May 24, 2019).  After concluding that Plaintiffs had standing \nto bring their challenge, the district court held that Plaintiffs were entitled to a \npreliminary injunction with respect to the section 8005 reprogramming authority \nbecause they would likely succeed in arguing that Defendants acted ultra vires, \nthey had demonstrated that they would be irreparably harmed, and the balance of \nequities weighed in their favor.  Id. at *13-23, *27-28, *29.  The court declined to \nrule on Plaintiffs’ likelihood of success on their section 2808 arguments, however, \nbecause Defendants had not yet disclosed a plan for diverting funds under that \nauthority.  Id. at *25, *28-29.  Finally, the court concluded that Plaintiffs were \nunlikely to succeed on their NEPA argument.  Id. at *26.  It accordingly granted \nthe following preliminary injunction: \nDefendants Patrick M. Shanahan, in his official capacity as Acting Secretary \nof Defense, Kevin K. McAleenan, in his official capacity as Acting \nSecretary of Homeland Security, Steven T. Mnuchin, in his official capacity \nas Secretary of the Department of the Treasury, and all persons acting under \ntheir direction, are enjoined from taking any action to construct a border \nbarrier in the areas Defendants have identified as Yuma Sector Project 1 and \nEl Paso Sector Project 1 using funds reprogrammed by DoD under Section \n8005 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2019.  \n \n   21     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 22 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 22 of 105\nId. at 30.9   \nDefendants filed a motion in the district court to stay the preliminary \ninjunction pending appeal.  The district court denied that motion, concluding that \nDefendants were unlikely to prevail on the merits and that the “request to proceed \nimmediately with the enjoined construction would not preserve the status quo” but \nrather would “effectively moot [Plaintiffs’] claims.”  Sierra Club v. Trump, No. \n4:19-cv-00892-HSG, 2019 WL 2305341, at *1 (N.D. Cal. May 30, 2019). \nOn June 3, 2019, Defendants filed an emergency motion with this court \nrequesting a stay pending appeal.  Defendants implored our court to act as quickly \nas possible because they were incurring daily fees and penalties from contractors \ndue to the suspension of construction and because, if the injunction remained in \nplace, Defendants would need to begin the process of reprogramming the funds \nagain by the end of June or else face the risk of being deprived of the use of those \nfunds entirely.10  \n                                           \n9 The district court simultaneously denied the motion for a preliminary \ninjunction in the related case brought by states, explaining that there was no \nlikelihood of irreparable injury once it had granted the injunction in the Sierra \nClub case.  See State v. Trump, No. 4:19-cv-00872-HSG, 2019 WL 2247814, at \n*17 (N.D. Cal. May 24, 2019). \n10 We note that Defendants did not file any motion to expedite the appeal \nitself, and as explained below, actually filed a motion to delay the expedited \nbriefing schedule our court had issued for the preliminary injunction appeal, asking \nus to let the parties wait until after further anticipated decisions in the district court \nand our court’s decision on their stay motion to propose a new briefing schedule \nthat could govern “any” full appeal. \n   22     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 23 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 23 of 105\nInitial briefing on the stay motion was completed on June 14, and we heard \noral argument on June 20.  On June 24, we requested supplemental briefing from \nthe parties on issues that arose during oral argument but that had not been briefed.  \nThat briefing was completed on June 28. \nMeanwhile, proceedings continued in the district court.  On May 29, \nPlaintiffs filed a motion for a supplemental preliminary injunction to block the \nadditional planned construction in California and Arizona using funds \nreprogrammed under sections 8005 and 9002 of the Department of Defense \nAppropriations Act of 2019, as well as section 1512 of the 2019 NDAA.  Plaintiffs \nacknowledged that the motion “present[ed] virtually identical legal questions \nregarding whether the proposed plan for funding border barrier construction \nexceeds the Executive Branch’s lawful authority” to the ones that the court had \ndecided in its May 24 order granting in part Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary \ninjunction.  On June 12, 2019, Plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment, \nseeking a permanent injunction based on the same arguments made in their initial \nand supplemental motions for a preliminary injunction.  Defendants cross-moved \nfor summary judgment, resting on the same arguments they had made against the \npreliminary injunction.  Briefing on those motions was completed on June 24. \nOn June 28, the district court issued an order granting in part and denying in \npart Plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment, and denying Defendants’ \n   23     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 24 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 24 of 105\ncross-motion for partial summary judgment.

In that order, \nthe court issued a permanent injunction prohibiting Defendants from using \nreprogrammed funds to construct a border barrier in the El Paso and Yuma Sectors \n(the subject of the initial preliminary injunction) as well as the more recently-\nannounced El Centro and Tucson Sector areas (the subject of the motion for a \nsupplemental preliminary injunction).11  Id. at *6.  The district court concluded that \nPlaintiffs’ legal challenge was meritorious, that Plaintiffs had shown that they \nwould suffer irreparable harm absent a permanent injunction, and that the balance \nof hardships and the public interest supported a permanent injunction.  Id. at *4-5.  \nThe court heeded Defendants’ request to certify the judgment for immediate \n                                           \n11 The terms of the permanent injunction are identical to those of the \npreliminary injunction, but it also covers funds reprogrammed under sections 8005 \nand 9002 for construction in the El Centro and Tucson sectors.  In full, the \npermanent injunction states: \nDefendants Mark T. Esper, in his official capacity as Acting Secretary of \nDefense, Kevin K. McAleenan, in his official capacity as Acting Secretary \nof Homeland Security, Steven T. Mnuchin, in his official capacity as \nSecretary of the Department of the Treasury, and all persons acting under \ntheir direction, are enjoined from taking any action to construct a border \nbarrier in the areas Defendants have identified as El Paso Sector 1, Yuma \nSector 1, El Centro Sector, and Tucson Sectors 1–3 using funds \nreprogrammed by DoD under Sections 8005 and 9002 of the Department of \nDefense Appropriations Act, 2019. \nSierra Club, 2019 WL 2715422, at *6. \n   24     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 25 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 25 of 105\nappeal, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b), and it denied Defendants’ request to stay the \ninjunction pending appeal.  Id. at *5-6. \nDefendants filed an immediate notice of appeal from that decision.  At \nDefendants’ request, we consolidated their new appeal with the pending appeal of \nthe preliminary injunction.  Defendants now seek a stay of the permanent \ninjunction pending appeal, resting on the same arguments they made about the \npreliminary injunction because the underlying legal questions are identical. \nII.  Issues Not Before the Court \nBefore turning to the merits, we highlight what is not at issue in this appeal.  \nFirst, Defendants at oral argument acknowledged that they are “not challenging \n[Article III] standing for purposes of the stay motion.”  Thus, Defendants do not \ndispute that Plaintiffs have suffered an “actual or imminent,” “concrete and \nparticularized,” “injury in fact” that is “fairly traceable” to Defendants’ actions and \nthat will “likely” be “redressed by a favorable decision.”  Lujan v. Defs. of \nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992) (quotation marks and alterations omitted); \nSpokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016).  We have satisfied ourselves \nthat Defendants’ assessment is correct.  See Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw \nEnvtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 180 (2000) (discussing a court’s sua \nsponte obligation to assure itself that it has jurisdiction before proceeding to the \nmerits).  Plaintiffs have alleged enough to satisfy the requirements for standing \n   25     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 26 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 26 of 105\nunder Article III at this stage of the litigation.  Id. at 181-83 (holding that the \nplaintiffs’ injuries from environmental harm were sufficient for standing). \nSecond, although Defendants may have access to other funding sources to \nbuild a border barrier, the only source at issue in this stay motion is section 8005 \nreprogramming.12  The district court’s preliminary injunction order discussed \nvarious other potential sources, including the Treasury Forfeiture Fund and money \nreallocated after a national emergency declaration for “military construction \nprojects” under section 2808.  Sierra Club v. Trump, No. 4:19-cv-00892-HSG, \n2019 WL 2247689, at *11 (N.D. Cal. May 24, 2019).  The injunction, however, \nonly concerns section 8005 reprogramming for border barrier construction in \nYuma Sector Project 1, El Paso Sector 1, El Centro Sector 1, and Tucson Sectors \n1-3.  We have not been asked to expand the scope of the injunction, and the parties \nhave not addressed in this stay motion any non-section 8005 funding sources.  \nAccordingly, our decision does not address any sources of funds Defendants might \nuse to build a border barrier except those reprogrammed under section 8005.   \nThird, as the district court observed in the preliminary injunction order,  \nThe case is not about whether the challenged border \nbarrier construction plan is wise or unwise.  It is not \n                                           \n12 As noted above, the parties do not contest that the related reprogramming \nprovisions—section 9002 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of \n2019 and section 1512 of the NDAA—are subject to section 8005’s requirements.  \nWe accordingly refer to these requirements collectively by reference to section \n8005. \n   26     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 27 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 27 of 105\nabout whether the plan is the right or wrong policy \nresponse to existing conditions at the southern border of \nthe United States.  These policy questions are the subject \nof extensive, and often intense, differences of opinion, \nand this Court cannot and does not express any view as to \nthem.   \nSierra Club, 2019 WL 2247689, at *1.  Our consideration is limited to legal \nquestions regarding the authority of the Executive Branch under the Constitution \nand under statutes enacted into law by Congress. \nIII.  Justiciability \n  Defendants have not argued that jurisdiction over this action is lacking.  Nor \nhave they asserted that Plaintiffs’ challenge to the section 8005 reprogramming \npresents a nonjusticiable “political question.”  They have contended, however, that \n“[t]he real separation-of-powers concern is the district court’s intrusion into the \nbudgeting process,” which “is between the Legislative and Executive Branches—\nnot the judiciary.”  We consider, therefore, whether it is appropriate for the courts \nto entertain Plaintiffs’ action in the first place.  We conclude that it is. \n“Cases” and “controversies” that contain “a textually demonstrable \nconstitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department,” Baker \nv. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 217 (1962), or “revolve around policy choices and value \ndeterminations constitutionally committed for resolution to the halls of Congress or \nthe confines of the Executive Branch,” Japan Whaling Ass’n v. Am. Cetacean Soc., \n478 U.S. 221, 230 (1986), present a “narrow exception” to our responsibility to \n   27     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 28 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 28 of 105\ndecide cases properly before us, Zivotofsky ex rel. Zivotofsky v. Clinton, 566 U.S. \n189, 195 (2012).   \nNowhere does the Constitution grant Congress the exclusive ability to \ndetermine whether the Executive Branch has violated the Appropriations Clause.  \nSee Office of Pers. Mgmt. v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414, 425 (1990).  Nor does the \nConstitution leave the Executive Branch to police itself.  Rather, the judiciary \n“appropriately exercises” its constitutional function “where the question is whether \nCongress or the Executive is ‘aggrandizing its power at the expense of another \nbranch.’”  Zivotofsky, 566 U.S. at 197 (quoting Freytag v. Comm’r, 501 U.S. 868, \n878 (1991)).  \nThe current action does not ask us to decide whether the projects for which \nDefendants seek to reprogram funds are worthy or whether, as a policy judgment, \nfunds should be spent on them.  Instead, we are asked whether the reprogramming \nof funds is consistent with the Appropriations Clause and section 8005.  That “is a \nfamiliar judicial exercise.”  Id. at 196. \nChief Justice Marshall’s answer to “whether the legality of an act of the head \nof a department be examinable in a court of justice” or “only politically \nexaminable” remains the same: “[W]here a specific duty is assigned by law, and \nindividual rights depend upon the performance of that duty, . . . the individual who \nconsiders himself injured, has a right to resort to the laws of his country for a \n   28     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 29 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 29 of 105\nremedy.”  Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 165-66 (1803).  Pursuant to \nits exclusive power of appropriation, Congress imposed on the Executive Branch a \nduty—contained in section 8005—not to transfer funds unless certain \ncircumstances were present.  As discussed above, see supra Section II, Defendants \nhave not disputed that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged injuries that satisfy \nArticle III’s standing requirement to enable them to pursue this action.  Although \n“our decision may have significant political overtones,” Japan Whaling Ass’n, 478 \nU.S. at 230, “courts cannot avoid their responsibility merely ‘because the issues \nhave political implications,’” Zivotofsky, 566 U.S. at 196 (quoting INS v. Chadha, \n462 U.S. 919, 943 (1983)).  In sum, it is appropriate for this action to proceed in \nfederal court.  \nIV.  Stay Standards \nWe decide whether to issue a stay by considering four factors, reiterated by \nthe Supreme Court in Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418 (2009):  \n(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is \nlikely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be \nirreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will \nsubstantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding; and \n(4) where the public interest lies.   \nId. at 434 (quoting Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776 (1987)).  The first two \nfactors “are the most critical,” and we only reach the last two “[o]nce an applicant \nsatisfies the first two factors.”  Id. at 434-35.   \n   29     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 30 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 30 of 105\nThe requirement that an applicant for a stay make a “strong showing” may \nbe explained at least in part by the fact that “[a] stay is not a matter of right, even if \nirreparable injury might otherwise result.”  Id. at 433 (quoting Virginian Ry. Co. v. \nUnited States, 272 U.S. 658, 672 (1926)).  Indeed, “[a] stay is an intrusion into the \nordinary processes of administration and judicial review.”  Id. at 427 (quotation \nmarks omitted).  Issuing a stay is therefore “an exercise of judicial discretion” not \nto be issued “reflexively,” but rather based on the circumstances of the particular \ncase.  Id. at 427, 433.  “The party requesting a stay bears the burden of showing \nthat the circumstances justify an exercise of that discretion.”  Id. at 433-34.  Here, \nDefendants carry those burdens because it is Defendants who have sought a stay. \nThat being said, the unusual circumstances of this case complicate our \ntypically restrained approach to assessing the merits in this procedural posture.  \nWhen deciding whether to issue a stay, we usually speak about the merits in \nprobabilistic “likelihood” terms, in part because we recognize that the “ordinary \nprocesses of administration and judicial review” best ensure “careful review and a \nmeaningful decision.”  Id. at 427 (quotation marks omitted).  Particularly given a \nrecent increase in emergency petitions asking for injunctive relief or stays of \ninjunctive relief, we think it is especially important for courts to strive to follow the \ntraditional process of judicial review.  Otherwise, we are forced to decide “justice \non the fly.”  Id. \n   30     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 31 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 31 of 105\nHere, however, both sides contend that we must evaluate the merits of this \ncase now to preserve their interests—both agree that there is no time for the \n“ordinary” course of appellate review.13  As Defendants represented in their \nbriefing and again at oral argument, if the injunction remains in place, DoD’s \nauthority to spend the remaining challenged funds on border barrier construction, \nor to redirect them for other purposes, will lapse.  At the same time, as the district \ncourt noted, allowing Defendants to move forward with spending the funds will \nallow construction to begin, causing immediate, and likely irreparable, harm to \nPlaintiffs.  Sierra Club v. Trump, No. 4:19-cv-00892-HSG, 2019 WL 2247689, at \n*27-28 (N.D. Cal. May 24, 2019).  In either scenario, many of the issues in this \ncase may become moot or largely moot before fuller litigation of the appeal can be \ncompleted.  Accordingly, we proceed to evaluate the merits more fully than we \notherwise might in response to a stay request.14 \n                                           \n13 The dissent suggests that we should not be analyzing the merits at this \nstage because there will be a fuller appeal later.  Dissent at 2 n.1.  That argument \ndepends on disbelieving Defendants’ assertions that the Executive Branch will lose \nits ability to spend the reprogrammed money by the beginning of July, if not \nearlier.  To the extent Defendants’ representations about their imminent injury are \nnot credible, Defendants certainly do not deserve the equitable relief of a stay. \n14 In an appeal from a district court’s grant of a permanent injunction, we \nmay “affirm the district court on any ground supported by the record.”  Sony \nComputer Entm’t, Inc. v. Connectix Corp., 203 F.3d 596, 608 (9th Cir. 2000) \n(quoting Charley’s Taxi Radio Dispatch Corp. v. SIDA of Haw., Inc., 810 F.2d \n869, 874 (9th Cir. 1987)).  Evaluating whether Defendants have a likelihood of \n \n   31     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 32 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 32 of 105\nV.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nIn their operative Complaint, Plaintiffs framed their claim in various ways.  \nPlaintiffs asserted constitutional claims based on violations of separation of powers \nprinciples, the Appropriations Clause, and the Presentment Clause; a claim that \nDefendants acted ultra vires; and a statutory claim under the Consolidated \nAppropriations Act of 2019.15  Because we conclude that Plaintiffs’ claim is, at its \ncore, one alleging a constitutional violation, we focus on that issue.  More than one \nlegal doctrine offers Plaintiffs a cause of action to raise that claim, and Plaintiffs’ \nsuccess under each depends on whether Defendants’ actions indeed violate the \nConstitution. \nA. Plaintiffs’ Constitutional Claim \n  The Constitution’s Appropriations Clause provides that “No Money shall be \ndrawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.”  \nU.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 7.  In addition to safeguarding “the public treasure, the \ncommon fund of all,” and providing “a most useful and salutary check upon . . . \ncorrupt influence and public peculation,” it ensures that the “the executive [does \nnot] possess an unbounded power over the public purse of the nation.”  3 Joseph \n                                           \nsuccess on appeal therefore requires assessing whether there are clear grounds for \naffirmance supported by the record. \n15 Plaintiffs also separately asserted a NEPA claim.  The parties have not \nmade any arguments about the NEPA claim in these stay proceedings, so we do not \naddress it. \n   32     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 33 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 33 of 105\nStory, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States § 1342 (Boston, \nHilliard, Gray & Co. ed. 1833).   \nThis approach to the power of the purse comported with the Founders’ \n“declared purpose of separating and dividing the powers of government,” namely \n“to ‘diffus[e] power the better to secure liberty.’”  Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, \n721 (1986) (alteration in original) (quoting Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. \nSawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring)); see also INS v. \nChadha, 462 U.S. 919, 949-50 (1983) (collecting sources and explaining the \nFounders’ belief in “the need to divide and disperse power in order to protect \nliberty”).  In response to critiques that his proposed Constitution would \ndangerously concentrate power in a single central government, James Madison \nargued that the risk of abuse of such power was low because “the sword and purse \nare not to be given to the same member” of the government.  3 Debates in the \nSeveral State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution 393 \n(Jonathan Elliot ed., 2d ed. 1836).  Instead, Madison explained that “[t]he purse is \nin the hands of the representatives of the people,” who “have the appropriation of \nall moneys.”  Id.   \nPlaintiffs’ principal legal theory is that Defendants seek to spend funds for a \ndifferent purpose than that for which Congress appropriated them, thereby \n   33     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 34 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 34 of 105\nviolating the Appropriations Clause.16  Defendants’ defense to this claim is that, \nthrough section 8005, Congress allowed Defendants to make this reallocation.  If \nDefendants were correct that section 8005 allowed this spending reallocation, \nPlaintiffs’ claim would fail, because the spending would be consistent with \nCongress’s appropriation legislation.  If section 8005 does not authorize the \nreallocation, however, then Defendants are acting outside of any statutory \nappropriation and are therefore spending funds contrary to Congress’s \nappropriations decisions.  We believe Plaintiffs are correct that there is no statutory \nappropriation for the expenditures that are the subject of the injunction.  \nReprogramming and spending those funds therefore violates the Appropriations \nClause.   \n1. Section 8005’s Meaning \n  Defendants argue that they are likely to prevail on appeal because Congress \nhas authorized DoD to reprogram funds, the planned use of funds is consistent with \nthat reprogramming authorization, and this spending is therefore authorized by an \nappropriation from Congress as the Appropriations Clause requires.  We disagree.  \n                                           \n16 Throughout this litigation, Plaintiffs’ claim has been framed in various \nways.  The lack of compliance with section 8005 has sometimes been labeled ultra \nvires as outside statutory authority or as outside the President’s Article II powers, \nand spending without an appropriation has been described as a violation of the \nAppropriations Clause.  However their claim is labeled, Plaintiffs’ theory is \nultimately the same.   \n   34     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 35 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 35 of 105\nDoD’s proposed expenditures are not authorized by the applicable reprogramming \nstatute.  They therefore are not “in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.”  \nU.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 7. \nAt bottom, this constitutional issue turns on a question of statutory \ninterpretation.  Section 8005 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of \n2019 provides that the Secretary of Defense may reprogram funds for certain \nmilitary functions other than those for which they were initially appropriated, but it \nlimits the Secretary’s ability to do so to a narrow set of circumstances.  Pub. L. No. \n115-245, § 8005, 132 Stat. 2981, 2999 (2018).17  Transferred funds must address \n                                           \n17 Section 8005 provides, in relevant part:  \n \nUpon determination by the Secretary of Defense that such action \nis necessary in the national interest, he may, with the approval of \nthe Office of Management and Budget, transfer not to exceed \n$4,000,000,000 of working capital funds of the Department of \nDefense or funds made available in this Act to the Department of \nDefense for military functions (except military construction) \nbetween such appropriations or funds or any subdivision thereof, \nto be merged with and to be available for the same purposes, and \nfor the same time period, as the appropriation or fund to which \ntransferred: Provided, That such authority to transfer may not be \nused unless for higher priority items, based on unforeseen military \nrequirements, than those for which originally appropriated and in \nno case where the item for which funds are requested has been \ndenied by the Congress . . . Provided further, That no part of the \nfunds in this Act shall be available to prepare or present a request \nto the Committees on Appropriations for reprogramming of funds, \nunless for higher priority items, based on unforeseen military \nrequirements, than those for which originally appropriated and in \n \n   35     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 36 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 36 of 105\n“higher priority items, based on unforeseen military requirements, than those for \nwhich originally appropriated.”  Id.  And “in no case” may the Secretary use the \nfunds “where the item for which reprogramming is requested has been denied by \nthe Congress.”  Id.  We conclude, as Plaintiffs argue, that those requirements are \nnot satisfied. \ni.  “Unforeseen” \nPlaintiffs argue that the President’s repeated and unsuccessful requests for \nmore border barrier funding make the request here obviously not unforeseen.  \nDefendants assert in response, without citation, that “[a]n expenditure is \n‘unforeseen’ . . . if DoD was not aware of the specific need when it made its \nbudgeting requests.”  Defendants contend that DoD could not have foreseen the \n“need to provide support” to DHS for border barrier construction in the relevant \nsectors when it made its budget requests for 2019, before DHS’s own budget was \neven finalized.  \n  Defendants mistakenly focus on the assertion that DoD “could not have \nanticipated that DHS would request specific support for roads, fences, and \nlighting.”  Even assuming that is true, the fact remains that DHS came to DoD for \nfunds because Congress refused to grant DHS itself those funds.  And when \n                                           \nno case where the item for which reprogramming is requested has \nbeen denied by the Congress. \n   36     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 37 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 37 of 105\nproperly viewed as applying to the broader “requirement” of a border wall, not to \nDHS’s specific need to turn to an entity other than Congress for funds, it is not \ncredible that DoD did not foresee this requirement.  The long history of the \nPresident’s efforts to build a border barrier and of Congress’s refusing to \nappropriate the funds he requested makes it implausible that this need was \nunforeseen. \nii.  “Denied by the Congress” \n  Even if there could be doubt about how to interpret “unforeseen,” it is clear \nthat Congress denied this request.  Because each of section 8005’s conditions must \nbe satisfied for DoD’s reprogramming and spending to be constitutionally \npermissible, this conclusion alone undermines Defendants’ likelihood of success \non the merits on appeal.  \nDefendants urge that “an ‘item for which funds are requested’” refers to “a \nparticular budget item” for section 8005 purposes, so “Congress’s decisions with \nrespect to DHS’s more general request for border-wall funding [are] irrelevant.”  \nBut this interpretation, which would require that a specific funding request be \nexplicitly rejected by Congress, is not compatible with the plain text of section \n8005.  First, the statute refers to “item[s] . . . denied by the Congress,” not to \nfunding requests denied by the Congress, suggesting that the inquiry centers on \nwhat DoD wishes to spend the funds on, not on the form in which Congress \n   37     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 38 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 38 of 105\nconsidered whether to permit such spending.  Second, Defendants give the term \n“denied” a meaning other than its “ordinary, contemporary, and common” one.  \nUnited States v. Iverson, 162 F.3d 1015, 1022 (9th Cir. 1998).  In common usage, a \ngeneral denial of something requested can, and in this case does, encompass more \nspecific or narrower forms of that request.  To illustrate, if someone offered a new \njob asks her potential future employer for a larger compensation package than was \nincluded in the job offer and the request is denied, she has been denied a five \npercent higher salary even if her request did not specifically ask for that amount.   \nAs the district court noted, Defendants’ reading of section 8005 also would \nproduce the perverse result that DoD could, by declining to present Congress with \na particular line item to deny, reprogram funds for a purpose that Congress refused \nto grant another agency elsewhere in the budgeting process.18  In other words, it \nwould simply invite creative repackaging.  But putting a gift in different wrapping \npaper does not change the gift.  Identifying the request to Congress as having come \npreviously from DHS instead of from DoD does not change what funding was \nrequested for: a wall along the southern border. \nConstruing section 8005 with an eye towards the ordinary and \ncommon-sense meaning of “denied,” real-world events in the months and years \n                                           \n18 That result would hardly comport with Congress’s stated desire in drafting \nthe language currently in section 8005 “to tighten congressional control of the \nreprogramming process.”  H.R. Rep. No. 93-662, at 16 (1973). \n   38     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 39 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 39 of 105\nleading up to the 2019 appropriations bills leave no doubt that Congress considered \nand denied appropriations for the border barrier construction projects that DoD \nnow seeks to finance using its section 8005 authority.  Long before the emergency \ndeclaration and DoD’s reprogramming at issue here, the President made plain his \ndesire to construct a border barrier, requesting $5.7 billion from Congress to do so.  \nThroughout 2018, Congress considered multiple bills that would have supported \nconstruction of such a barrier; it passed none of them.  See supra Section I.  \nThat DoD never specifically requested from Congress the specific sums at \nissue here for the specific purpose of counterdrug funding at the southern border \n(and that Congress therefore never had cause to deny that specific request) is of no \nmoment.  The amount to be appropriated for a border barrier occupied center stage \nof the budgeting process for months, culminating in a prolonged government \nshutdown that both the Legislative and Executive Branches clearly understood as \nhinging on whether Congress would accede to the President’s request for $5.7 \nbillion to build a border barrier.     \nIn sum, Congress considered the “item” at issue here—a physical barrier \nalong the entire southern border, including in the Yuma, El Paso, Tucson, and El \nCentro sectors—and decided in a transparent process subject to great public \nscrutiny to appropriate less than the total amount the President had sought for that \nitem.  To call that anything but a “denial” is not credible.   \n   39     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 40 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 40 of 105\n2. Defendants’ Interpretation and Agency Deference \nDefendants did not argue in their briefing to the district court, their stay \nmotion, or their supplemental briefing that their contrary interpretation of section \n8005 is entitled to agency deference.  Even setting aside whether Defendants’ \nfailure to raise such an argument may operate as a waiver or forfeiture, we \nconclude that their position is unworthy of deference when evaluated under \ntraditional standards for reviewing agency action. \nUnder the two-step framework articulated in Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. \nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984), a reviewing court \nwill often defer to an agency’s interpretation of an ambiguous statute administered \nby the agency.  Id. at 843.  To determine whether the Chevron framework governs \nat all, however, there is a threshold “step zero” inquiry in which we ask whether “it \nappears that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules \ncarrying the force of law, and [whether] the agency interpretation claiming \ndeference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.”  United States v. \nMead Corp., 533 U.S. 218, 226-27 (2001).  “Delegation of such authority may be \nshown in a variety of ways, [such] as by an agency’s power to engage in \nadjudication or notice-and-comment rulemaking, or by some other indication of a \ncomparable congressional intent.”  Id. at 227.  And to evaluate whether the agency \nexercised its authority, we look to “the interpretive method used and the nature of \n   40     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 41 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 41 of 105\nthe question at issue,” considerations that may include “the interstitial nature of the \nlegal question, the related expertise of the [a]gency, the importance of the question \nto administration of the statute, the complexity of that administration, and the \ncareful consideration the [a]gency has given the question over a long period of \ntime.”  Barnhart v. Walton, 535 U.S. 212, 222 (2002).  If we determine that (1) \nCongress did not intend to delegate interpretive authority to the agency, or (2) that \nthe agency did not take the challenged action in exercise of that authority, we defer \nto the agency only to the extent that the agency’s reasoning is persuasive.  Mead, \n533 U.S. at 234 (citing Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134 (1944)). \nUnder this framework, DoD’s current interpretation of section 8005 is not \nentitled to deference.  First, it does not appear that Congress intended to delegate to \nDoD the power to interpret section 8005.  DoD’s authorizing and appropriating \nstatutes do not contain an explicit grant of rulemaking power to the agency.  \nSection 8005 could suggest a potential congressional intent to delegate to DoD the \nauthority to interpret the phrase “higher priority items, based on unforeseen \nmilitary requirements,” because these are subjects about which DoD has expertise.  \nBut the same is not true of the “denied by the Congress” limitation, given that DoD \nhas no clear expertise in assessing what “denied by the Congress” might mean.  \nMoreover, as discussed above, Congress’s intent in inserting the “denied by the \n   41     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 42 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 42 of 105\nCongress” limitation in the first place was to tighten the fiscal reins and retain \ncongressional control over the appropriations process.  See supra n.18. \nSecond, the agency has not advanced its interpretation in a manner that \nwould typically trigger review under Chevron.  There is no question that DoD did \nnot conduct notice-and-comment rulemaking or other formalized procedures in \ninterpreting section 8005.  See Mead, 533 U.S. at 230 (“[T]he overwhelming \nnumber of our cases applying Chevron deference have reviewed the fruits of \nnotice-and-comment rulemaking or formal adjudication.”).  Nor were there any \nother features in DoD’s interpretive process here that might otherwise justify \nChevron deference.  See Barnhart, 535 U.S. at 222.  There is no indication that \nDoD’s decision was the product of “careful consideration . . . over a long period of \ntime” or any other procedural rigor that would more closely approximate a formal \nrulemaking.  Id.  On the contrary, DoD’s interpretation appears to have emerged in \na matter of weeks.  And to the extent that DoD has mustered further support for its \ninterpretation during this litigation, that litigating position is not entitled to \nChevron deference.  Price v. Stevedoring Servs. of Am., Inc., 697 F.3d 820, 830 \n(9th Cir. 2012) (en banc) (“Without a basis in agency regulations or other binding \nagency interpretations, there is usually no justification for attributing to an agency \nlitigating position ‘the force of law.’” (quoting Mead, 533 U.S. at 227)).  \n   42     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 43 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 43 of 105\nAccordingly, we conclude that Chevron deference to DoD’s interpretation of \nsection 8005 is not warranted. \n  An agency action not entitled to Chevron deference may nevertheless carry \npersuasive weight based on the factors that the Supreme Court enumerated in \nSkidmore, 323 U.S. at 140.  See Mead, 533 U.S. at 234-35.  Under Skidmore, we \nlook to “the thoroughness evident in [the agency’s] consideration, the validity of its \nreasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those \nfactors which give it power to persuade.”  323 U.S. at 140.   \nDoD’s interpretation of section 8005 does not warrant deference under \nSkidmore’s standards either.  The two documents in the record that appear to \ncontain DoD’s analysis of the section 8005 requirements—the official \nreprogramming action and a related memorandum to DoD’s comptroller—are \nentirely conclusory.  The reprogramming action merely parrots the statute without \nanalysis:  \nThis reprogramming action provides funding in support of higher \npriority items, based on unforeseen military requirements, than those \nfor which originally appropriated; and is determined to be necessary \nin the national interest.  It meets all administrative and legal \nrequirements, and none of the items has previously been denied by the \nCongress. \nThe memorandum contains little more, stating that “[t]he need to provide \nsupport . . . was . . . not known at the time of the [Fiscal Year] 2019 budget \nrequest” and that Congress had not denied funding for the items.  The Supreme \n   43     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 44 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 44 of 105\nCourt has found unpersuasive under Skidmore agency determinations containing \nfar more reasoning than that which we confront here.  See Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 \nU.S. 243, 253-54 (2006) (rejecting as unpersuasive under Skidmore an interpretive \nrule announced by the Attorney General that “[i]ncorporat[ed] the legal analysis of \na memorandum he had solicited from his Office of Legal Counsel”); Christensen v. \nHarris County, 529 U.S. 576, 581, 587 (2000) (rejecting as unpersuasive under \nSkidmore an interpretation in an opinion letter containing brief textual analysis and \ncitation to operative regulations).   \nDefendants’ interpretation also fails to rest on the sort of expertise that might \ninspire deference.  See Gonzales, 546 U.S. at 269 (“[Skidmore] deference here is \ntempered by the Attorney General’s lack of expertise in this area.”); cf. Kisor v. \nWilkie, No. 18-15, 2019 WL 2605554, at *9 (U.S. June 26, 2019) (explaining that \nwhen an agency interprets its own regulation, its “interpretation must in some way \nimplicate its substantive expertise” to be entitled to deference); compare Mead, \n533 U.S. at 235 (“There is room at least to raise a Skidmore claim here, where . . . \n[the agency] can bring the benefit of specialized experience to bear on the subtle \nquestions in this case.”). \n* * * \nWithout section 8005’s statutory authorization to reprogram funds for \nsection 284 security measures, no congressional action permits Defendants to use \n   44     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 45 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 45 of 105\nthose funds to construct border barriers.  “The President’s power . . . must stem \neither from an act of Congress or from the Constitution itself.  There is no statute \nthat expressly authorizes the President to [act] as he did here.  Nor is there any act \nof Congress to which our attention has been directed from which such a power can \nfairly be implied.”  Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 585.  Defendants’ attempt to \nreprogram and spend these funds therefore violates the Appropriations Clause and \nintrudes on Congress’s exclusive power of the purse, for it would cause funds to be \n“drawn from the Treasury” not “in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.”  \nU.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 7.   \nB. Whether Plaintiffs Have a Cause of Action \nDefendants argue that none of the foregoing analysis matters because \nPlaintiffs lack a cause of action to challenge the reprogramming of funds at issue \nhere.  We disagree.  Plaintiffs may bring their challenge through an equitable \naction to enjoin unconstitutional official conduct, or under the judicial review \nprovisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq., as \na challenge to a final agency decision that is alleged to violate the Constitution, or \nboth.  Either way, Plaintiffs have an avenue for seeking relief. \n1. Equitable Cause of Action \nThe Supreme Court has “long held that federal courts may in some \ncircumstances grant injunctive relief against” federal officials violating federal \n   45     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 46 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 46 of 105\nlaw.  Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 135 S. Ct. 1378, 1384 (2015); see \nalso Corr. Servs. Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U.S. 61, 74 (2001) (“[I]njunctive relief has \nlong been recognized as the proper means for preventing entities from acting \nunconstitutionally.”).  “The ability to sue to enjoin unconstitutional actions by state \nand federal officers is the creation of courts of equity, and reflects a long history of \njudicial review of illegal executive action, tracing back to England.”  Armstrong, \n135 S. Ct. at 1384; see also Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo S.A. v. All. Bond Fund, \nInc., 527 U.S. 308, 318-19 (1999) (“[T]he substantive prerequisites for obtaining \nan equitable remedy as well as the general availability of injunctive relief . . . \ndepend on traditional principles of equity jurisdiction.” (quoting 11A Charles Alan \nWright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure § 2941, at 31 (2d ed. 1995)).  \nIn Youngstown, for example, the Supreme Court heard a challenge to a \nwartime presidential order directing the Secretary of Commerce to seize and \noperate a majority of the nation’s steel mills.  343 U.S. at 582.  Acting pursuant to \nthe presidential order, the Secretary of Commerce issued possessory orders that \nrequired the seized companies to operate according to the Secretary’s direction.  Id. \nat 583.  The plaintiff steel mill owners challenged the order as amounting to \nlawmaking, a function that “the Constitution has expressly confided to the \nCongress and not to the President.”  Id. at 582.  The President contended that his \norder was “necessary to avert a national catastrophe.”  Id.  In addressing the \n   46     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 47 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 47 of 105\ndispute, the Court held that there was no statute that authorized the order, and that \n“[t]he order [could not] properly be sustained as an exercise of the President’s \nmilitary power,” or any other constitutional grant of power to the President.  Id. at \n587.  The Court therefore held that “th[e] seizure order [could not] stand.”  Id. at \n589. \nMore recently, in Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392 (2018), the Supreme \nCourt heard a challenge to a presidential proclamation restricting the entry of \ncertain foreign nationals into the United States on the ground that it violated the \nEstablishment Clause of the First Amendment.  Id. at 2403.  Plaintiffs were \nindividuals who alleged that they were injured by being separated from relatives \nbarred from entering the country.  Id. at 2416.  Without discussing whether a cause \nof action existed to challenge the alleged constitutional violation, the Court \nreached the merits of the plaintiffs’ Establishment Clause claim.  See id. at \n2416-17.  The government had contended that the plaintiffs’ claims were not \njusticiable because the Establishment Clause did not give them a legally protected \ninterest in the admission of particular foreign nationals, but the Court rejected this \nargument and proceeded to evaluate the merits of the plaintiffs’ claim.  Id. at 2416.  \nTrump v. Hawaii and Youngstown therefore support the conclusion that Plaintiffs \nmay seek equitable relief to remedy an alleged constitutional violation.  \n   47     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 48 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 48 of 105\nConsistent with these cases, our court allowed an equitable action to enforce \nthe Appropriations Clause in United States v. McIntosh, 833 F.3d 1163 (9th Cir. \n2016).  In McIntosh, appellants were criminal defendants who had been federally \nindicted on marijuana-related offenses.  Id. at 1168-69.  They sought to enjoin their \nprosecutions, claiming that a congressional appropriations rider prohibited the \nDepartment of Justice (“DOJ”) from spending money on their prosecutions \nbecause their marijuana-related activities were licensed under state law.  Id. at \n1169, 1177.  We held that the defendant-appellants could properly “enjoin their \nprosecutions on the grounds that [DOJ] [was] prohibited from spending funds to \nprosecute them” if they could demonstrate that their conduct was authorized by \nstate law and thus fell within what the appropriations rider was enacted to protect.  \nId. at 1169, 1174.  As we explained: “Congress has enacted an appropriations rider \nthat specifically restricts DOJ from spending money to pursue certain activities,” \nand it had acted within its “‘exclusive province’” in doing so.  Id. at 1172 (quoting \nTenn. Valley Auth. v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153, 194 (1978)).  Once Congress has so acted, \n“it is for . . . the courts to enforce” its decisions.  Id. (quoting Tenn. Valley Auth., \n437 U.S. at 194).  Contrary to the dissent’s characterization, we did not in \nMcIntosh treat the alleged constitutional violation only “as a defense for criminal \ndefendants.”  Dissent at 21.  Instead we held that “Appellants . . . can seek—and \n   48     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 49 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 49 of 105\nhave sought—to enjoin [an agency] from spending funds” contrary to Congress’s \nrestrictions.  McIntosh, 833 F.3d at 1172. \nRelying on Dalton v. Specter, 511 U.S. 462 (1994), Defendants argue that \nthere cannot be a constitutional cause of action here.  Dalton involved a challenge \nto the President’s discretionary decision to agree to a specific military base closure \nincluded in a base closure package proposed by an independent commission \npursuant to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (“DBCRA”).  \nId. at 464-66.  The Supreme Court held that the plaintiff’s statutory challenge to \nthe President’s decision failed because the statute gave the President unfettered \ndiscretion.  Id. at 474-76.  The Court then also rejected the argument that because \nthe President had allegedly violated the statute, he had acted unconstitutionally.  Id. \nat 472-74.  In explanation, the Court stated that “every action by the President, or \nby another executive official, in excess of his statutory authority is [not] ipso facto \nin violation of the Constitution.”  Id. at 472.  The Court did not say, however, that \naction in excess of statutory authority can never violate the Constitution or give \nrise to a constitutional claim.  Statutory and constitutional claims are not mutually \nexclusive.  Indeed, the Court went on in Dalton to state that Youngstown “cannot \nbe read for the proposition that an action taken by the President in excess of his \nstatutory authority necessarily violates the Constitution.”  Id. at 473 (emphasis \n   49     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 50 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 50 of 105\nadded).  There would have been no reason for the Court to include the word \n“necessarily” if the two claims were always mutually exclusive. \nIn Dalton, the President’s authority was put at issue because of the \ncontention that he had violated requirements set by DBCRA.  It was only because \nCongress had enacted a statutory process for closing bases that the Court \nconsidered whether it could review the President’s compliance with DBCRA and \nultimately concluded that it could not because the statute gave the President \nunreviewable discretion.  Id. at 474-76.  It was in that context that the Court \nexplained that an allegation that the President had not complied with the statute \nwould not necessarily become a constitutional claim through an ultra vires theory.  \nId. at 472-73.  Because DBCRA authorized unfettered discretion by the President \nto either approve or disapprove the package of base closures as a whole, the Court \nhad no occasion to consider the constitutional implications of violating statutes, \nsuch as section 8005, that authorize executive action contingent on satisfaction of \ncertain requirements.19  Here, unlike in Dalton, Plaintiffs’ claim is not one “simply \nalleging that the President has exceeded his statutory authority.”  Id. at 473 \n                                           \n19 The dissent notes that when Congress appropriates funds in lump-sum \namounts, and leaves it to the unfettered discretion of the agency to re-allocate \nfunds, no judicial review is available.  Dissent at 8 (citing Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 \nU.S. 182, 193 (1993)).  That principle has no bearing here.  Section 8005 does not \ninvolve a lump sum whose allocation is committed to the agency’s discretion, but \ninstead imposes restrictions on when and for what purposes the agency may use \nreprogrammed funds. \n   50     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 51 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 51 of 105\n(emphasis added).  Rather, Plaintiffs claim that to the extent Defendants did not \nhave statutory authority to reprogram the funds, they acted in violation of \nconstitutional separation of powers principles because Defendants lack any \nbackground constitutional authority to appropriate funds—making Plaintiffs’ claim \nfundamentally a constitutional one.20  Dalton therefore does not foreclose \nPlaintiffs’ constitutional claim here.21 \n                                           \n20 Defendants rely on Harrington v. Schlesinger, 528 F.2d 455 (4th Cir. \n1975), in which the Fourth Circuit held that the claims of several individual \ntaxpayers who alleged that the government was spending money in violation of \ntwo statutes did not satisfy the test for taxpayer standing enunciated in Flast v. \nCohen, 392 U.S. 83 (1968), because they “present[ed] no constitutional challenge \nto any congressional appropriation,” Harrington, 528 F.2d at 457.  Harrington is \nlargely inapposite, because Plaintiffs do not rely on taxpayer standing here.  The \ncourt in Harrington noted, however, that “[i]f there were a clear and flagrant \nviolation of congressional limitations upon expenditures, a court in a taxpayer suit \nmight find its intervention appropriate.” Id. at 458.  Thus, if Harrington has any \npersuasive value here, we think it is in suggesting that Plaintiffs do have a cause of \naction because, as we have discussed, there has been a clear violation of Congress’ \nlimits on expenditures. \n21 The dissent suggests that Train v. City of New York, 420 U.S. 35 (1975), \nsupports the proposition that a claim attacking the Executive Branch’s reading of \nan appropriations statute sounds only in that statute and not in the Constitution.  \nDissent at 8-9.  But the plaintiffs in Train argued not that the Executive Branch \nwas spending money that Congress had never appropriated, rather that the \nExecutive Branch was refusing to allot money Congress had specifically instructed \nit to spend.  420 U.S. at 42.  There was thus no constitutional claim at issue in \nTrain, and if there had been, it would have had nothing to do with the prohibitions \non unauthorized spending imposed by the Appropriations Clause.  The Supreme \nCourt in Train considered only the statutory question whether an Executive Branch \nagency had failed to comply with a specific statutory mandate because that was the \nonly issue in that case, not because the existence of a statute had any bearing on \nconstitutional reviewability. \n \n   51     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 52 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 52 of 105\nDefendants also cannot be right in their apparent contention that as long as \nan official identifies some statutory authorization for his actions, doing so makes \nany challenge to those actions statutory and precludes constitutional review.  It \ncannot be that simply by pointing to any statute, governmental defendants can \nforeclose a constitutional claim.  At the risk of sounding tautological, only if the \nstatute actually permits the action can it even possibly give authority for that \naction.22  For the reasons explained above, section 8005 does not permit the action \nhere.   \nCongress may, of course, limit a court’s equitable power to enjoin acts \nviolating federal law.  See Armstrong, 135 S. Ct. at 1385 (explaining that an \nequitable remedy is not available where Congress has demonstrated an “intent to \nforeclose” that form of relief, as where a statutory provision (1) expressly provided \na method of enforcing a substantive right, or (2) lacked a judicially administrable \nstandard (quoting Verizon Md., Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm’n of Md., 535 U.S. 635, \n647 (2002))).  But Defendants do not argue that Congress has demonstrated any \n                                           \n22 Although in Youngstown the President conceded that no statute authorized \nhis actions, and relied only on his Article II powers, 343 U.S. at 587, we do not see \nhow Defendants’ willingness or unwillingness to concede that a particular statute \ndoes not authorize their actions should affect whether Plaintiffs in this case have a \ncause of action—particularly when, as we have discussed, we think it quite clear \nthat section 8005 does not authorize the reprogramming.  Thus, we do not think \nthat the concession in Youngstown was determinative, or that the lack of a \nconcession is determinative here.   \n   52     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 53 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 53 of 105\nsuch intent to limit equitable remedies here, and we have identified no statute that \ndoes so.  Indeed, to foreclose a remedy for a constitutional violation, Congress \nmust demonstrate its intent by “clear and convincing evidence.”  Weinberger v. \nSalfi, 422 U.S. 749, 762 (1975) (quoting Johnson v. Robinson, 415 U.S. 361, 373 \n(1974)); see also City of Chicago v. Int’l Coll. of Surgeons, 522 U.S. 156, 183 \n(1997) (“[J]udicial review of [federal] administrative action is the rule, and \nnonreviewability an exception which must be demonstrated.” (alterations in \noriginal) (quoting Barlow v. Collins, 397 U.S. 159, 166 (1970)).  \n2. Administrative Procedure Act Cause of Action \nPlaintiffs’ claim is also cognizable under the APA.  The APA provides for \njudicial review of “[a]gency action made reviewable by statute and final agency \naction for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.”  5 U.S.C. § 704.  \nHere, Plaintiffs have a cause of action under the APA as long as there has been \nfinal agency action, and as long as Congress has not limited review of such actions \nthrough other statutes or committed them to agency discretion.  Neither of these \nbars to APA relief is present here.  See 5 U.S.C. §§ 701(a), 704, 706; Bennett v. \nSpear, 520 U.S. 154, 175 (1997). \nThe APA mandates that a court “shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside \nagency action . . . found to be . . . contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, \nor immunity.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B).  Plaintiffs’ challenge is to a final agency \n   53     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 54 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 54 of 105\naction and alleges that the action violates the Appropriations Clause, so it falls \nwithin the APA’s scope.23 \nAlthough section 701(a)(2) of the APA “preclude[s] judicial review of \ncertain categories of administrative decisions,” this case does not involve such an \n“administrative decision traditionally regarded as committed to agency discretion.”  \nLincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 191-92 (1993).  In their emergency stay motion and \nrelated supplemental briefing, Defendants do not argue that DoD’s actions were \ncommitted to “agency discretion by law,” so as to preclude review under the APA.  \nWe agree with Defendants’ implicit concession that this is not a case involving a \n“statute . . . drawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard against \nwhich to judge the agency’s exercise of discretion.”  Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. \n821, 830 (1985).   \nAny constitutional challenge that Plaintiffs may advance under the APA \nwould exist regardless of whether they could also assert an APA claim that DoD’s \n                                           \n23 Defendants argue that DoD’s reprogramming action is not a final agency \naction in part because it “imposes no obligations and confers no rights upon \nplaintiffs.” Exec. Tan Br. at 14.  But the question we must ask in determining \nfinality is whether the agency action imposes obligations on the agency, not \nwhether it imposes obligations on Plaintiffs.  See Bennett, 520 U.S. at 177 (holding \nthat the challenged agency actions were final because they “alter[ed] the legal \nregime to which the action agency [wa]s subject” (emphasis added)).  Here, as we \nhave discussed, the reprogramming action purports to affect DoD’s legal right to \nuse particular funds to build a border barrier instead of the purpose for which they \nwere originally appropriated.  \n   54     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 55 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 55 of 105\napplication of section 8005 was “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or \nlimitations, or short of statutory right.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C); see Webster v. Doe, \n486 U.S. 592, 602-04 (1988) (holding that a plaintiff may raise under the APA a \nconstitutional challenge to agency action even where the plaintiff lacks an avenue \nunder the APA to argue that the same agency action is invalid for statutory or \nprocedural reasons).  If “Congress intends to preclude judicial review of \nconstitutional claims[,] its intent to do so must be clear.”  Webster, 487 U.S. at 603.  \nCongress has not done so here.   \n3. Survival of at Least One Cause of Action \nThe dissent argues that Plaintiffs’ claim is necessarily one encompassed by \nthe APA, and that the availability of an APA cause of action precludes Plaintiffs’ \nequitable claim.  We do not think that the APA forecloses Plaintiffs’ equitable \nclaim.  And even if it did, then for the reasons we have discussed, Plaintiffs would \nhave an APA claim.  Either way, it cannot be that both an equitable claim and an \nAPA claim foreclose the other, leaving Plaintiffs with no recourse.   \nIt is true that the APA is the general mechanism by which to challenge final \nagency action.  See Weyerhaeuser Co. v. U.S. Fish & Wildlife Serv., 139 S. Ct. \n361, 370 (2018) (noting the “basic presumption of judicial review [created by the \nAPA] for one ‘suffering legal wrong because of agency action’” (quoting Abbott \nLabs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 140 (1967)).  But this does not mean the APA \n   55     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 56 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 56 of 105\nforecloses other causes of action.  In Navajo Nation v. Department of the Interior, \n876 F.3d 1144 (9th Cir. 2017), we explained that “a court is foreclosed by [APA \nsection] 704 from entertaining claims brought under the APA seeking review of \nnon-final agency action (and not otherwise permitted by law),” but that this final \nagency action limitation does not apply “to other types of claims (like . . . \nconstitutional claims).”  Id. at 1170.   \nLikewise, in Presbyterian Church v. United States, 870 F.2d 518 (9th Cir. \n1989), we allowed constitutional claims to proceed without even deciding whether \nan APA cause of action was available.  There, plaintiff churches brought claims for \ninjunctive relief against the United States, DOJ, and the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service (“INS”) and certain INS officials, alleging violations of \ntheir First and Fourth Amendment rights by INS agents’ surreptitious recording of \ntheir church services.  Id. at 520.  The district court dismissed the plaintiffs’ claims \nas, in relevant part, barred by sovereign immunity.  Id. at 521.  We reversed, \nholding that APA section 702 waived the government defendants’ sovereign \nimmunity for claims seeking non-monetary relief.  Id. at 523-24.  We further \nexplained that this waiver of sovereign immunity was not limited to suits involving \nan “agency action” as defined under the APA.  Id. at 525.  We therefore did not \nreach the question whether the actions challenged in that case were ones for which \nthe APA would provide a cause of action.  Id. at 525 n.8.  Rather, we remanded for \n   56     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 57 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 57 of 105\nfurther analysis of standing and mootness, and, if the district court determined it \nhad jurisdiction, for evaluation of the plaintiffs’ constitutional claims.  Id. at 529.  \nNavajo Nation and Presbyterian Church clearly contemplate that claims \nchallenging agency actions—particularly constitutional claims—may exist wholly \napart from the APA.   \nIn fact, the APA provides for judicial review only of “[a]gency action made \nreviewable by statute and final agency action for which there is no other adequate \nremedy in a court.”  5 U.S.C. § 704.  Here, no statute expressly makes Plaintiffs’ \nclaims reviewable, but, as we have explained, Plaintiffs do have an adequate \nremedy in a court: an equitable cause of action for injunctive relief.  If either form \nof their claim precludes the other, it would therefore seem that their equitable \nclaim to enjoin unconstitutional action would preclude their APA claim to enjoin \nunconstitutional action.  But even if it is the other way around, these causes of \naction cannot possibly be the legal equivalent of baking soda and vinegar—when \nthey come in contact, there is no reason to believe they both go up in smoke.  \nC. Zone of Interests \nDefendants argue that even if a cause of action generally exists to challenge \nthe reprogramming, Plaintiffs must satisfy a “zone of interests” test to establish \nthat they, specifically, have a cause of action for the constitutional violation they \nallege here.  Defendants argue that this test would apply to Plaintiffs’ claim \n   57     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 58 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 58 of 105\nwhether characterized as an equitable cause of action to enjoin a constitutional \nviolation or as an APA claim.  We are doubtful that a zone of interests test applies \nto Plaintiffs’ equitable cause of action.  Although we recognize that the APA \ngenerally does carry a zone of interests test, there is some lack of clarity with \nrespect to what that might look like in a constitutional context.  We need not \nresolve these ambiguities in the case law, however, because we believe Plaintiffs \nfall within any zone of interests test that may apply. \n1. Applicability of a Zone of Interests Test \nCourts apply the zone of interests test to “determine, using traditional tools \nof statutory interpretation, whether a legislatively conferred cause of action \nencompasses a particular plaintiff’s claim.”  Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static Control \nComponents, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 127 (2014).  To determine whether a plaintiff \nsatisfies this test we ask whether the plaintiff’s “interests fall within the zone of \ninterests protected by the law invoked.”  Id. at 129 (quotation marks omitted).  In \nanswering this question, we recognize that “the breadth of the [applicable] zone of \ninterests varies according to the provisions of law at issue.”  Id. at 130 (quoting \nBennett, 520 U.S. at 163).     \nThe zone of interests test derives from the Supreme Court’s decision in \nAssociation of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150 \n(1970), where the Court articulated a limit on causes of action conferred by the \n   58     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 59 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 59 of 105\nAPA.  But the Court clarified in Lexmark that the test “applies to all statutorily \ncreated causes of action . . . and that Congress is presumed to ‘legislate against the \nbackground of’ the zone-of-interests limitation, ‘which applies unless it is \nexpressly negated.’”  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 129 (emphasis added) (quoting Bennett, \n520 U.S. at 163).24  \nWe are doubtful that any zone of interests test applies to Plaintiffs’ equitable \ncause of action to enjoin a violation of the Appropriations Clause, particularly after \nLexmark.   \nAs an initial matter, we are skeptical that there could be a zone of interests \nrequirement for a claim alleging that official action was taken in the absence of all \nauthority, like that which Plaintiffs assert here.  The D.C. Circuit’s decision in \nHaitian Refugee Center v. Gracey, 809 F.2d 794 (D.C. Cir. 1987), explains why it \ndoes not make sense to treat such claims as carrying a zone of interests \nrequirement.  There, the court heard a challenge to a government program for \n                                           \n24 Many pre-Lexmark cases refer to the zone of interests test—and the \nbroader question whether a particular plaintiff has a cause of action—as a part of \nthe standing inquiry (and, more specifically, as a component of “prudential \nstanding”).  See Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 126-27.  In Lexmark, however, the Court \nclarified that the zone of interests test does not go to a plaintiff’s standing but \nrather to whether the plaintiff has a cause of action.  Id. at 127, 128 n.4.  The Court \nsuggested that holding otherwise would be “in some tension with [the Court’s] \nrecent affirmation of the principle that ‘a federal court’s obligation to hear and \ndecide’ cases within its jurisdiction ‘is virtually unflagging.’”  Id. at 126 (quoting \nSprint Commc’ns, Inc. v. Jacobs, 571 U.S. 69, 77 (2013). \n   59     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 60 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 60 of 105\nintercepting ships carrying undocumented immigrants, in which the plaintiffs \nargued that the program exceeded authority granted by statute or the Constitution.  \nId. at 797-98.  The court ultimately held that the plaintiffs lacked standing.  Id. at \n800-01.  But, citing Youngstown in its discussion, the D.C. Circuit noted that the \nplaintiffs were not required to “show that their interests [fell] within the zones of \ninterests of the constitutional and statutory powers invoked by the President in \norder to . . . challenge the . . . program as ultra vires.”  Id. at 811 n.14.  \n“Otherwise,” the court explained, “a meritorious litigant, injured by ultra \nvires action, would seldom have standing to sue since the litigant’s interest \nnormally will not fall within the zone of interests of the very statutory or \nconstitutional provision that he claims does not authorize action concerning that \ninterest.”  Id.  In other words, where the very claim is that no statutory or \nconstitutional provision authorized a particular governmental action, it makes little \nsense to ask whether any statutory or constitutional provision was written for the \nbenefit of any particular plaintiffs. \nConsistent with this logic, Youngstown did not apply a zone of interests test.  \nAlthough we acknowledge that Youngstown was decided before the Supreme Court \nhad formally articulated a zone of interests test, Youngstown did not address any \nsimilar concept, either.  Rather, the Court held that the President had unlawfully \nintruded on the lawmaking function reserved to Congress without ever discussing \n   60     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 61 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 61 of 105\nwhether the plaintiffs, steel mill owners whose property was ordered to be seized, \nwere the intended beneficiaries of the structural provisions in Article II.   \nSimilarly, in Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417 (1998), which \naddressed a Presentment Clause challenge, the Supreme Court said nothing about a \nzone of interests requirement.  In that case, two sets of plaintiffs challenged the \nconstitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act, which allowed the President to veto \nonly particular provisions in enacted laws, rather than the entire law.  Id. at 420-21.  \nOne set of plaintiffs consisted of the City of New York, a hospital and two hospital \nassociations, and unions representing hospital employees.  Id. at 425.  Another \nconsisted of a cooperative of Idaho potato growers, and an individual potato \nfarmer.  Id.  All the plaintiffs alleged that they were injured by the President’s \ncancellation of particular line items in the budget that would have inured to their \nfinancial benefit.  Id. at 421.  The Supreme Court held that the Act violated the \nstructural protections provided by the Presentment Clause, without asking whether \nthe plaintiffs fell within any zone of interests of that clause.  Id. at 436-48.   \nThe Appropriations Clause likewise operates as a structural protection built \ninto our constitutional system.  Just as the Court in Clinton treated as sufficient that \nthe plaintiffs were concretely injured as a result of the alleged Presentment Clause \nviolation, we believe it is likely sufficient here that Plaintiffs would be concretely \n   61     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 62 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 62 of 105\ninjured by the alleged Appropriations Clause violation, and that no zone of \ninterests test applies to their claim.   \nEven if a zone of interests test may have been applied to some cases \nconsidering constitutional claims like Plaintiffs’ prior to Lexmark, we think that \nLexmark has called into question its continuing applicability to constitutional \nclaims.  Lexmark focuses on Congress’s intent in creating statutory causes of \naction, casting doubt on Defendants’ argument that a zone of interests test has any \nrole to play here, where Plaintiffs’ theory derives from the Constitution.  The Court \nin Lexmark described the purpose of the zone of interests test as being to discern \nwhether a statutory cause of action exists—specifically, “whether a legislatively \nconferred cause of action encompasses a particular plaintiff’s claim.”  572 U.S. at \n127.  Because the Constitution was not created by any act of Congress, it is hard to \nsee how the zone of interests test would even apply.25   \n                                           \n25 Defendants argue that an equitable cause of action to enjoin a \nconstitutional violation is, at its root, a creation of statute, and is therefore \nencompassed within Lexmark’s references to causes of action created by statute.  \nAlthough Defendants are correct that Congress granted federal courts equity \njurisdiction by statute, see Grupo Mexicano, 527 U.S. at 318 (“The Judiciary Act \nof 1789 conferred on the federal courts jurisdiction over all suits . . . in equity.” \n(quotation marks omitted)); see also 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (“The district courts shall \nhave original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or \ntreaties of the United States.”), we think it a stretch to conclude that the traditional \nequitable cause of action to enjoin a constitutional violation was therefore created \nby statute.  Indeed, the lower federal courts are created entirely by statute, see An \nAct to Establish the Judicial Courts of the United States §§ 2-6, 1 Stat. 73 (1789), \n \n   62     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 63 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 63 of 105\nIndeed, in its recent decision in Tennessee Wine & Spirits Retailers Ass’n v. \nThomas, No. 18-96, 2019 WL 2605555 (U.S. June 26, 2019), in which the \nplaintiffs alleged a violation of the dormant Commerce Clause, the Supreme Court \ndid not even mention the zone of interests test.  Given that the Court did apply a \nzone of interests test in Boston Stock Exchange v. State Tax Commission, 429 U.S. \n318 (1977), a pre-Lexmark dormant Commerce Clause case, Tennessee Wine \nsupports the idea that Lexmark has changed the landscape.  See 429 U.S. at 602 \nn.3. \nFor all of these reasons, we doubt that any zone of interests test applies to \nPlaintiffs’ equitable cause of action. \nWe recognize that the Supreme Court has consistently applied a zone of \ninterests test to causes of action arising under the APA.  When the Court has \napplied the zone of interests test in APA actions, however, it has analyzed the zone \nof interests of the statute the agency is alleged to have violated, not any zone of \ninterests of the APA itself.  In Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi \nIndians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209 (2012), for example, the Court examined an APA \naction alleging that the government had exceeded its statutory authority to take title \n                                           \nbut this does not mean that all constitutional claims filed in a federal district court \nare really statutory claims.  See, e.g., Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. \nBureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 397 (1971) (recognizing “a cause of action \nunder the Fourth Amendment” for damages).   \n   63     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 64 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 64 of 105\nto a piece of property “for the purpose of providing land for Indians.”  Id. at 211 \n(quoting the Indian Reorganization Act, 25 U.S.C. § 465 (2012) (current version at \n25 U.S.C. § 5108)).  It concluded that the plaintiff, who lived near land that had \nbeen acquired by the Secretary of the Interior for an Indian tribe seeking to open a \ncasino, was “arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by” \nthe Indian Reorganization Act, which “authorize[d] the acquisition of property ‘for \nthe purpose of providing land for Indians.’”  Id. at 211-12, 224-26 (first quoting \nAss’n of Data Processing Serv. Orgs., 397 U.S. at 153, then quoting 25 U.S.C. \n§ 465 (2012) (current version at 25 U.S.C. § 5108)).  In so doing, it departed from \nthe reasoning of the district court, which had concluded that the plaintiff fell \noutside the Act’s zone of interests because he was “not an Indian, nor [did] he \npurport to seek to protect or vindicate the interests of any Indians or Indian tribes.”  \nPatchak v. Salazar, 646 F. Supp. 2d 72, 77 (D.D.C. 2009).  And in Air Courier \nConference of America v. American Postal Workers Union, 498 U.S. 517 (1991), \nthe Court asked whether postal workers bringing a claim under the APA were \nwithin the zone of interests protected by the Private Express Statutes on which \ntheir claims depended.26   \n                                           \n26 In Bennett, the Court noted that because the zone of interests test “varies \naccording to the provisions of law at issue, . . . what comes within the zone of \ninterests of a statute for purposes of obtaining judicial review . . . under the \n‘generous review provisions’ of the APA may not do so for other purposes.”  520 \n \n   64     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 65 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 65 of 105\nHere, rather than looking at a statute underlying an APA action to determine \nthe relevant zone of interests, we would need to look at the Appropriations Clause.  \nBecause, as we have discussed, we are doubtful that any zone of interests test \napplies to claims seeking to enjoin a violation of the Appropriations Clause, we \nthink it is possible that the present type of APA claim is distinct from typical APA \nclaims and that there is no zone of interests requirement here.  We need not decide \nthat question, however, because we believe that, even if a zone of interests test \napplied here, it would be satisfied.   \n2. Whether Any Zone of Interests Test Is Satisfied \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs cannot satisfy the zone of interests test \nbecause their claims fall outside the zone of interests of section 8005.  Although \nPlaintiffs’ Complaint did assert a claim under section 8005, it also asserted \nconstitutional claims, including a claim for a violation of the Appropriations \nClause.  To the extent any zone of interests test applies to that constitutional claim \n(whether brought in equity or under the APA), it requires us to ask whether \nPlaintiffs fall within the zone of interests of the Appropriations Clause, not of \nsection 8005.  And when the Supreme Court has applied a zone of interests test to \n                                           \nU.S. at 163 (quoting Clark v. Sec. Indus. Ass’n, 479 U.S. 388, 400 n.16 (1987)).  \nWe read this not to suggest that a particular zone of interests test applies to all \nAPA actions, but that when analyzing whether a plaintiff falls within the zone of \ninterests of a particular statute, courts should be particularly lenient if a violation of \nthat statute is being asserted through an APA claim.   \n   65     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 66 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 66 of 105\nclaims about structural provisions of the Constitution, it has applied a very lenient \nversion of that test.   \nFor example, in Boston Stock Exchange, the Court held that plaintiff \nbusinesses that alleged financial injury from a state tax that discriminated against \nout-of-state businesses fell within the zone of interests of the implied dormant \nCommerce Clause, which functions as a limit on a state’s power relative to that of \nCongress to regulate interstate commerce.  429 U.S. at 320 n.3.  Although the suit \nwas not brought by Congress seeking to protect its Commerce Clause authority, or \neven by another state alleging harm from the defendant state’s tax law, the Court \nheld that the plaintiffs were permitted to assert that the state defendant had acted in \na manner that infringed on Congress’s constitutional authority.  Id. \nMore recently, in McIntosh, we allowed criminal defendants charged with \nmarijuana-related offenses to seek an injunction prohibiting DOJ from spending \nfunds in violation of the Appropriations Clause.  833 F.3d at 1168, 1172.  We \nexplained: “When Congress has . . . expressly prohibit[ed] DOJ from spending \nfunds on certain actions, federal criminal defendants may seek to enjoin the \nexpenditure of those funds, and we may exercise jurisdiction over a district court’s \ndirect denial of a request for such injunctive relief.”  Id. at 1172-73.  To the extent \nwe implicitly applied a zone of interests test to the criminal defendants, it was not a \nrestrictive one—indeed, our primary concern was to confirm that the defendants \n   66     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 67 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 67 of 105\nhad standing to challenge the Appropriations Clause violation (and we concluded \nthey did).  Id. at 1173-74. \nAccordingly, if Plaintiffs must fall within a zone of interests served by the \nconstitutional provision they seek to vindicate, we are persuaded that they do.  The \nAppropriations Clause is a vital instrument of separation of powers, which has as \nits aim the protection of individual rights and liberties—not merely separation for \nseparation’s sake.  See supra section V.A.  As Justice Kennedy put it in Clinton:  \n[I]f a citizen who is taxed has the measure of the tax or the decision to \nspend determined by the Executive alone, without adequate control by \nthe citizen’s Representatives in Congress, liberty is threatened. . . .  \nThe individual loses liberty in a real sense if that instrument is not \nsubject to traditional constitutional constraints. \n524 U.S. at 451 (Kennedy, J., concurring).  Because “individuals, too, are \nprotected by the operations of separation of powers and checks and balances,” it \nfollows that “they are not disabled from relying on those principles in otherwise \njusticiable cases and controversies.”  Bond v. United States, 564 U.S. 211, 223 \n(2011).      \nPlaintiffs assert that if Defendants’ allegedly unconstitutional spending \nproceeds, they will suffer injuries to their environmental, professional, aesthetic, \nand recreational interests.  Those individual rights and interests resemble myriad \ninterests that the Supreme Court has concluded—either explicitly or tacitly—fall \nwithin any applicable zone of interests encompassed by structural constitutional \n   67     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 68 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 68 of 105\nprinciples like separation of powers.  See, e.g., Chadha, 462 U.S. at 935-36, \n951-52 (allowing a plaintiff with an interest in avoiding deportation to bring a \nconstitutional claim based on bicameralism and presentment requirements); Bos. \nStock Exch., 429 U.S. at 602 n.3 (allowing a plaintiff stock exchange with an \ninterest in avoiding a state tax to bring a claim enforcing Congress’s dominion over \nthe regulation of interstate commerce).  Plaintiffs’ claim that their rights or liberties \nwere infringed by a violation of the Appropriations Clause therefore falls within \nany zone of interests required to enforce that clause’s provisions.   \nVI.  The Remaining Stay Factors \nOur focus to this point has been on the first of the four factors to be \nconsidered in deciding a motion to stay, “whether the stay applicant has made a \nstrong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits.”  Nken v. Holder, 556 \nU.S. 418, 434 (2009).  The second factor, “whether the applicant will be \nirreparably injured absent a stay,” was identified in Nken together with the first \nfactor as “the most critical.”  Id.   \nThe Supreme Court observed in Nken that the third and fourth factors—\nwhether issuance of a stay will substantially injure other parties and where the \npublic interest lies—“merge when the Government is the opposing party.”  Id. at \n435.  That case involved an application for a stay of removal by a noncitizen who \nwas facing deportation.  The motion before us presents a variant on that situation.  \n   68     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 69 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 69 of 105\nHere, it is Defendants who seek a stay, so the question whether Defendants will be \nirreparably injured absent a stay may, in practical terms, merge with consideration \nof the public interest. \nPublic interest is a concept to be considered broadly.  The Court noted in \nNken, for example, that there is a public interest in “preventing aliens from being \nwrongfully removed,” but also that there is “always a public interest in prompt \nexecution of removal orders.”  Id. at 436. \nDefendants have discussed these three remaining factors together in terms of \nthe “equitable balance of harms.”  There is logic in that, so we will do the same, \nconsidering the respective impacts on Defendants, Plaintiffs and others interested \nin the proceedings, and the general public. \nThe primary harm cited by Defendants if a stay is not granted is that a “delay \nin the construction of border fencing pending appeal will create irreparable harm” \nbecause “deadly drugs [will] flow into this country in the interim.”  They argue \nthat CBP has recorded over 4,000 “drug-related events” between border crossings \nin the El Paso, El Centro, Tucson, and Yuma Sectors in Fiscal Year 2018 and cites \nCBP’s seizure of thousands of pounds of marijuana and lesser amounts of other \nillegal substances, including cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and fentanyl.  \nWe do not question in the slightest the scourge that is illegal drug trafficking \nand the public interest in combatting it.  Our circuit includes several border states, \n   69     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 70 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 70 of 105\nand our courts deal with no small number of cases involving illegal drugs crossing \nthose states’ borders. \nDefendants have not actually spoken to the more relevant questions, \nhowever.  What will be the impact of building the barriers they propose?  Even \nmore to the point, what would be the impact of delaying the construction of those \nbarriers?  If these specific leaks are plugged, will the drugs flow through \nsomewhere else?  We do not know, but the evidence before us does not support a \nconclusion that enjoining the construction of the proposed barriers until this appeal \nis fully resolved will have a significant impact. \nTo begin with, the statistics cited by Defendants describe drug trafficking \nthat CBP has detected with existing barriers and law enforcement efforts.  They do \nnot tell us how much gets through undetected or what additional amounts would be \nstopped by the proposed barriers.  \nAs Plaintiffs point out, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration’s \nmost recent assessment, the “majority of the [heroin] flow is through [privately \noperated vehicles] entering the United States at legal ports of entry, followed by \ntractor-trailers, where the heroin is co-mingled with legal goods.”  Drug \nEnforcement Admin., 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment 19 (2018), \nhttps://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/2018-11/DIR-032-\n18%202018%20NDTA%20final%20low%20resolution.pdf.  Only “a small \n   70     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 71 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 71 of 105\npercentage of all heroin seized by [CBP] along the land border was between Ports \nof Entry.”  Id.  Fentanyl transiting the southern border is likewise most commonly \nsmuggled in “multi-kilogram loads” in vehicles crossing at legal ports of entry.  Id. \nat 33.  Defendants have not disputed these assessments.   \nThat does not lead to a conclusion that leaks should not be plugged.  It does \nsuggest, however, that Defendants’ claim that failing to stay the injunction pending \nappeal will cause significant irreparable harm is supported by much less than meets \nthe eye.  Congress could have appropriated funds to construct these barriers if it \nconcluded that the expenditure was in the public interest, but it did not. \nFor similar reasons, we are unmoved by Defendants’ contention that “the \ninjunction threatens to permanently deprive DoD of its authorization to use the \nfunds at issue to complete” the selected projects, including “approximately $1.1 \nbillion it has transferred for these projects but has not yet obligated via \nconstruction contracts,” because “the funding will likely lapse during the appeal’s \npendency.”  A lapse in funding does not mean that the money will disappear from \nthe Treasury.  The country will still have that money.  It could be spent in the \nfuture, including through appropriations enacted by Congress for the next fiscal \nyear.  The lapse simply means that Defendants’ effort to justify spending those \nfunds based on the appropriations act for the current fiscal year and the authority to \nreprogram funds under section 8005 may be thwarted.   \n   71     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 72 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 72 of 105\nDefendants’ identification of this lapse as a factor that should tip the balance \nof harms in their favor actually serves instead to illustrate the underlying weakness \nin their position.  Defendants’ rush to spend this money is necessarily driven by \ntheir understanding that Congress did not appropriate requested funding for these \npurposes in the current budget and their expectation that Congress will not \nauthorize that spending in the next fiscal year, either.  The effort by Defendants to \nspend this money is not consistent with Congress’s power over the purse or with \nthe tacit assessment by Congress that the spending would not be in the public \ninterest. \nFinally, Defendants maintain that a stay is necessary because DoD “is \nincurring unrecoverable fees and penalties of hundreds of thousands of dollars to \nits contractors for each day that construction is suspended.”  But that liability \nresulted from Defendants’ own decisions about how to proceed in the face of \nlitigation.  Plaintiffs filed their motion for a preliminary injunction on April 4, \n2019, and a hearing was held on May 17.  When DoD awarded contracts on April \n9 for El Paso Project Sector 1, and May 15 for Yuma Project Sector 1 and Tucson \nProject Sectors 1-3, DoD knew this litigation was pending and that the district \ncourt had been asked to enter a preliminary injunction.  Placing significant weight \non financial obligations that Defendants knowingly undertook would, in effect, \nreward them for self-inflicted wounds. \n   72     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 73 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 73 of 105\nMoving to the impacts on the Plaintiffs, Defendants denigrate those impacts \nas limited to “aesthetic and recreational injuries.”  As noted above, see supra \nSection II, Defendants have elected not to dispute that Plaintiffs’ interests are \nsufficiently substantial to support Article III standing.  Environmental injuries have \nbeen held sufficient in many cases to support injunctions blocking substantial \ngovernment projects.  The Supreme Court has observed that “[e]nvironmental \ninjury, by its nature, can seldom be adequately remedied by money damages and is \noften permanent or at least of long duration, i.e., irreparable.  If such injury is \nsufficiently likely, therefore, the balance of harms will usually favor the issuance \nof an injunction to protect the environment.”  Amoco Prod. Co. v. Village of \nGambell, 480 U.S. 531, 545 (1987).  \nAs to the public interest, we conclude that the public interest weighs \nforcefully against issuing a stay.  The Constitution assigns to Congress the power \nof the purse.  Under the Appropriations Clause, it is Congress that is to make \ndecisions regarding how to spend taxpayer dollars.  As we have explained, see \nsupra Section V.C.2., the Appropriations Clause serves as a check by requiring \nthat “not a dollar of [money in the Treasury] can be used in the payment of any \nthing not thus previously sanctioned” by Congress,” as “[a]ny other course would \ngive to the fiscal officers a most dangerous discretion.”  Reeside v. Walker, 52 U.S. \n   73     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 74 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 74 of 105\n272, 291 (1850).  In the words of then-Judge Kavanaugh, the Appropriations \nClause is \na bulwark of the Constitution’s separation of powers \namong the three branches of the National Government.  It \nis particularly important as a restraint on Executive \nBranch officers: If not for the Appropriations Clause, the \nexecutive would possess an unbounded power over the \npublic purse of the nation; and might apply all its monied \nresources at his pleasure. \n  \nU.S. Dep’t of Navy v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth., 665 F.3d 1339, 1347 (D.C. Cir. \n2012) (Kavanaugh, J.) (quotation marks omitted).  The Clause prevents the \nExecutive Branch from “even inadvertently obligating the Government to pay \nmoney without statutory authority.”  Id.  The public interest in ensuring protection \nof this separation of powers is foundational and requires little elaboration.  See \nsupra Section V.A.   \nSimilarly, when Congress chooses how to address a problem, “[i]t is quite \nimpossible . . . to find secreted in the interstices of legislation the very grant of \npower which Congress consciously withheld,” as doing so is “not merely to \ndisregard in a particular instance the clear will of Congress,” but “to disrespect the \nwhole legislative process and the constitutional division of authority between \nPresident and Congress.”  Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 609 (1952) (Frankfurter, J., \nconcurring).  Congress did not appropriate money to build the border barriers \nDefendants seek to build here.  Congress presumably decided such construction at \n   74     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 75 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 75 of 105\nthis time was not in the public interest.  See id.; supra Section V.A.1.ii.  It is not \nfor us to reach a different conclusion. \nThe public interest and the balance of hardships do not support granting the \nmotion to stay.  \nVII.  Conclusion \nIn his concurrence in Youngstown, Justice Jackson made eloquent comments \nthat seem equally apt today: \nThe essence of our free Government is “leave to live by no man’s \nleave, underneath the law”—to be governed by those impersonal forces \nwhich we call law.  Our Government is fashioned to fulfill this concept so \nfar as humanly possible.  The Executive, except for recommendation and \nveto, has no legislative power.  The executive action we have here originates \nin the individual will of the President and represents an exercise of authority \nwithout law. . . .  With all its defects, delays and inconveniences, men have \ndiscovered no technique for long preserving free government except that the \nExecutive be under the law, and that the law be made by parliamentary \ndeliberations. \n \nSuch institutions may be destined to pass away. But it is the duty of \nthe Court to be last, not first, to give them up. \n \n343 U.S. at 654-55 (Jackson, J., concurring). \n  Heeding Justice Jackson’s words, we deny Defendants’ motion for a stay. \n   75     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 76 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 76 of 105\nFILED\nSierra Club v.

DWYER, CLERK\nU.S. COURT OF APPEALS\nThe majority here takes an uncharted and risky approach—turning every\nquestion of whether an executive officer exceeded a statutory grant of power into a\nconstitutional issue. This approach is in contradiction to the most fundamental\nconcepts of judicial review. The majority has created a constitutional issue where\nnone previously existed. See Dalton v. Specter, 511 U.S. 462, 472–74 (1994). We\nhave no right to expand the Judiciary’s role in this manner and, as explained in\ngreater detail below, the majority’s approach has been expressly rejected by the\nSupreme Court.\nTurning to the merits of the case before us, we are asked solely whether we\nshould stay a permanent injunction prohibiting Defendants from transferring\ncertain funds within the budget of the Department of Defense (DoD) to support\ncounterdrug activities, while the parties await a final ruling on the merits of the\npermanent injunction order. We are not, as the majority claims, “evaluat[ing] the\nmerits more fully that we otherwise might.” Maj. Op. at 31. In fact, the parties have\nexpressly informed the court that they will be presenting an expedited briefing\nschedule for the merits panel by July 8, 2019, Dkt.

Id. at 435. Although\n“[t]he first two factors . . . are the most critical,” id. at 434, we must “give serious\nconsideration to the public interest factor,” Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. v. Winter,\n1The majority ignores this declaration. Maj. Op. at 31. The parties have\nasked us to expedite our decision, but they have not asked us to make a merits\ndecision in contravention of traditional procedure. Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418,\n427 (2009) (recognizing that the “ordinary processes of administration and judicial\nreview” best ensure “careful review and a meaningful decision” (citation omitted)).\nWhether an issue may become moot during the course of an appeal does not\nchange the scope of our review for a motion to stay. Even though the parties rely\non their previous briefs for purposes of this motion, they do not suggest that they\ndo not have additional arguments for the merits of appeal. We should not be\ndeciding the merits of these issues (potentially binding the merits panel).\n2\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 78 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 78 of 105\n502 F.3d 859, 863 (9th Cir. 2007). In any event, the decision to grant or deny a\nstay is discretionary. Nken, 556 U.S. at 433–34. Here, each factor favors issuing a\nstay.2\nI.  Defendants are Likely to Succeed on the Merits\nThe district court granted a permanent injunction in Plaintiffs’ favor based\non a purported statutory claim under the DoD Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year\n2019, Pub. L. No. 115-245, §§ 8005, 9002, 132 Stat. 2981, 2999. See Permanent\nInjunction Order at 3–4, 6–8. The district court analyzed only whether Defendants\nexceeded their statutory authority under § 8005, without discussing whether they\nalso separately violated any constitutional provision. See generally id.\n2Whether Defendants are likely to succeed on the merits of this appeal\nultimately turns on whether the district court abused its discretion in issuing the\npermanent injunction. See La Quinta Worldwide LLC v. Q.R.T.M., S.A. de C.V.,\n762 F.3d 867, 879 (9th Cir. 2014). Thus, even though this is only a motion to stay,\nwe review the district court’s grant of a permanent injunction for abuse of\ndiscretion, and we review its legal conclusions de novo. Aircraft Serv. Int’l, Inc. v.\nInt’l Bhd. of Teamsters, 779 F.3d 1069, 1072 (9th Cir. 2015) (en banc). “It is an\nabuse of discretion to apply the wrong legal standard.” United States v. Emmett,\n749 F.3d 817, 819 (9th Cir. 2014). As explained in greater detail below, the district\ncourt abused its discretion here by failing to analyze Plaintiffs’ claim under the\nAdministrative Procedure Act. See, e.g., Permanent Injunction Order at 4 (“[T]he\nCourt continues to find that the [zone of interests] test has no application in an\nultra vires challenge, which operates outside of the APA framework.”). The\nmajority does not defend the district court’s decision, but rules in Plaintiffs’ favor\nunder a completely different—yet equally faulty—legal theory. \n3\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 79 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 79 of 105\nNevertheless, the majority views Plaintiffs’ claim as, “at its core, one alleging a\nconstitutional violation.” Maj. Op. at 32. As discussed below, viewing Plaintiffs’\nclaim as alleging a statutory violation is the proper approach. Dalton, 511 U.S. at\n472–74.\nWhen their claim is properly viewed as alleging a statutory violation,\nPlaintiffs have no mechanism to challenge Defendants’ actions. Plaintiffs have\nneither an implied statutory cause of action under § 8005, nor an equitable cause of\naction. See generally Dalton, 511 U.S. at 472–76. Nor do Plaintiffs have a cause of\naction to challenge the DoD’s § 8005 reprogramming under the Administrative\nProcedure Act (APA), as they fall outside of the zone of interests for such a claim.\nConsequently, Defendants have made a strong showing that they are likely to\nsucceed on the merits of their appeal.\n1. Plaintiffs Claim Is Properly Viewed as Alleging a Statutory Violation\nBecause we are allowed to affirm the permanent injunction “on any ground\nsupported by the record,” Sony Comput. Entm’t, Inc. v. Connectix Corp., 203 F.3d\n596, 608 (9th Cir. 2000) (citation omitted), the majority denies Defendants’ motion\nfor a stay by re-characterizing Plaintiffs’ claim as a constitutional\nviolation—despite the contrary ground relied on by the district court in its\n4\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 80 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 80 of 105\ndecision3—which the majority now analyzes on the fly.\nThe majority’s primary mistake is drawing no distinction between a claim\nthat an agency is violating a statute and a claim that an agency is violating the\nConstitution:\nIf  section  8005  does  not  authorize  the  reallocation,  however,  then\nDefendants are acting outside of any statutory appropriation and are\ntherefore  spending  funds  contrary  to  Congress’s  appropriations\ndecisions. . . . The lack of compliance with section 8005 has sometimes\nbeen labeled ultra vires as outside statutory authority or as outside the\nPresident’s Article II powers, and spending without an appropriation has\nbeen described as a violation of the Appropriations Clause. However\ntheir claim is labeled, Plaintiffs’ theory is ultimately the same.  \nMaj. Op. at 34 & n.16. This approach is flatly contradicted by Dalton and related\ncases, which clarified the distinction between “claims of constitutional violations\nand claims that an official has acted in excess of his statutory authority” and\ndeclared that “[o]ur cases do not support the proposition that every action by the\nPresident, or by another executive official, in excess of his statutory authority is\n3The district court construed Plaintiffs’ claim as an ultra vires action to\nenforce § 8005.

It determined that principles of\nconstitutional avoidance required it to first analyze whether § 8005 supported the\nreprogramming, and reach the constitutional analysis only if necessary.

Thus, the court never conducted a constitutional analysis of this\nquestion. \n5\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 81 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 81 of 105\nipso facto in violation of the Constitution.” Dalton, 511 U.S. at 472.\nIndeed, recasting Plaintiffs’ challenge—fundamentally a dispute about\nwhether the DoD erred in deciding that the pre-conditions of § 8005 were met—as\na constitutional claim against the DoD for violating the Appropriations Clause\ncontradicts several lines of caselaw. \nFirst, Dalton clarifies that cases such as Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v.\nSawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952) involve constitutional violations, because “[t]he only\nbasis of authority asserted was the [executive’s] inherent constitutional power.”\nDalton, 511 U.S. at 473. In those instances, “the case necessarily turned on\nwhether the Constitution authorized the [executive’s] actions,” only “[b]ecause no\nstatutory authority was claimed.” Id. (emphasis added). \nThis is not that type of case. As noted by the majority, Plaintiffs’ claim\nentirely rises or falls on whether the DoD complied with the limitations in § 8005.\nMaj. Op. at 34 (“If Defendants were correct that section 8005 allowed this\nspending reallocation, Plaintiffs’ claim would fail, because the spending would be\nconsistent with Congress’s appropriation legislation. If section 8005 does not\nauthorize the reallocation, however, then Defendants are acting outside of any\nstatutory appropriation and are therefore spending funds contrary to Congress’s\nappropriations decisions.”). The DoD offers no other source of authority besides a\n6\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 82 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 82 of 105\nstatute. Accordingly, this case “concern[s] only issues of statutory interpretation”\nand “no constitutional question whatever is raised.” Dalton, 511 U.S. at 474 n.6\n(emphasis added) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \nSecond, applying Dalton to the Appropriations Clause context requires us to\nreject the majority’s logic, which relies on the assumption that every violation of\nan appropriations statute is necessarily a constitutional violation. In Dalton,\nCongress granted the President discretion to take certain actions, and the plaintiffs\nasserted that he had exceeded that authority. Id. at 474. The plaintiffs further\nclaimed that, because the President had exceeded his statutory authority, he had\nalso violated the Constitution. Id. That is precisely the majority’s approach in this\ncase. See Maj. Op. at 51 (“Plaintiffs claim that to the extent Defendants did not\nhave statutory authority to reprogram the funds, they acted in violation of\nconstitutional separation of powers principles because Defendants lack any\nbackground constitutional authority to appropriate funds.”). The Supreme Court\nrejected this type of constitutional claim, flatly reminding us that “[t]he distinction\nbetween claims that an official exceeded his statutory authority, on the one hand,\nand claims that he acted in violation of the Constitution, on the other, is too well\nestablished to permit this sort of evisceration.” Dalton, 511 U.S. at 474.  \nFinally, the distinction between an Appropriations Clause violation and a\n7\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 83 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 83 of 105\nnon-constitutional “exceeding statutory authority” claim turns on the degree of\ndiscretion Congress has provided to the agency or President in appropriating funds.\nOn the one hand, if Congress has entirely withdrawn agency discretion over the\nwho, what, when, where, and why of agency spending, an Appropriations Clause\nviolation may lie. See, e.g., United States v. McIntosh, 833 F.3d 1163, 1172, 1175\n(9th Cir. 2016). On the other hand, if Congress has merely appropriated a lump-\nsum amount and leaves it to the agency to re-allocate funds toward a particular\nstatutory purpose, Congress has provided such discretion to the agency that, not\nonly could there be no constitutional violation, a challenger does not even have a\nviable “exceeding statutory authority” claim.4 See Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182,\n193 (1993). Section 8005, which appropriates funds to the DoD and makes\nallocating those funds incumbent on the Secretary’s determination of the “national\ninterest” and other factors, falls somewhere in the middle. Unlike the\nappropriations language in McIntosh, which we observed “specifically restricts [the\nDepartment of Justice (DOJ)] from spending money to pursue certain activities,”\n833 F.3d at 1172 (emphasis added), or the non-discretionary “not to exceed” and\n“shall be allotted” language in Train v. City of New York, 420 U.S. 35, 42 (1975),\n4The statutory claims in Dalton ultimately failed on this basis. See Dalton,\n511 U.S. at 474–76.\n8\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 84 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 84 of 105\n§ 8005 provides some discretion over the who, what, when, where, and why of\nagency spending. Yet, unlike the virtually unfettered discretion of the agency to re-\nallocate funds towards particular statutory purposes in Lincoln, 508 U.S. at\n192–93, § 8005 constrains the discretion and the DoD is “not free simply to\ndisregard statutory responsibilities.” Id. at 193 (emphasis added). Accordingly, the\nDoD’s reprogramming of funds is a judicially reviewable statutory claim. The\nmajority overlooks these points.\nIn attempting to distinguish Dalton, the majority misstates the chronology of\nthe Supreme Court’s decision, claiming that “[t]he Supreme Court held that the\nplaintiff’s statutory challenge to the President’s decision failed because the statute\ngave the President unfettered discretion . . . [and] then also rejected the argument\nthat because the President had allegedly violated the statute, he had acted\nunconstitutionally.” Maj. Op. at 49. However, the Supreme Court declared first that\nthere was no constitutional issue, Dalton, 511 U.S. at 472–74, and only thereafter\ndetermined that the plaintiffs’ statutory claim failed based on the President’s\nunfettered discretion, id. at 474–76. Consequently, the Court’s conclusion that “no\nconstitutional question whatever is raised” did not stem from its later conclusion\nthat the President had, in fact, acted within his statutory authority in that case. Id. at\n474 n.6; see also id. at 476–77 (“In sum . . . [t]he claim that the President exceeded\n9\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 85 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 85 of 105\nhis authority under the 1990 Act is not a constitutional claim, but a statutory one.\nWhere a statute, such as the 1990 Act, commits decisionmaking to the discretion of\nthe President, judicial review of the President’s decision is not available.”\n(emphasis added)).\nThe majority also attempts to distinguish Dalton on the grounds that it “did\nnot say . . . that action in excess of statutory authority can never violate the\nConstitution or give rise to a constitutional claim.” Maj. Op. at 49. Albeit true that\nclaims alleging statutory violations and those alleging constitutional violations are\nnot mutually exclusive, Dalton expressly discussed when the two may be asserted\ntogether—by pointing to cases where the constitutionality of the authorizing statute\nitself is called into question. Dalton, 511 U.S. at 473 n.5; see, e.g., Chamber of\nCommerce of United States v. Reich, 74 F.3d 1322, 1325 (D.C. Cir. 1996)\n(determining that a claim raised a constitutional violation, because it alleged that\nthe relevant statutory authority itself was “an unconstitutional delegation” of\nCongressional power). But Plaintiffs have not alleged that § 8005 is itself\nunconstitutional.\nThe majority’s approach would turn our current system of administrative\nreview on its head, directing courts in this circuit to deem unconstitutional any\nreviewable executive actions (i.e., any actions that are not entirely within the\n10\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 86 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 86 of 105\nactor’s discretion) that exceed a statutory grant of authority. Such an approach\ndirectly contradicts the Supreme Court’s declaration that “[o]ur cases do not\nsupport the proposition that every action by the President, or by another executive\nofficial, in excess of his statutory authority is ipso facto in violation of the\nConstitution.”5 Dalton, 511 U.S. at 472. For those reasons, the majority’s approach\nis flawed; no claim of a constitutional violation exists in this case.\n2. Plaintiffs have no Implied Statutory Claim\nWhether Plaintiffs have an implied statutory cause of action under § 8005\nturns on “whether Congress intended to create a private cause of action.”\nKarahalios v. Nat’l Fed’n of Fed. Emps., Local 1263, 489 U.S. 527, 532 (1989)\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\nHere, “[t]here is no express suggestion” that Congress intended a direct\njudicial remedy for a § 8005 violation, and “neither the language nor the structure\nof the Act shows any congressional intent to provide a private cause of action to”\njudicially enforce such a violation. Id. at 532–33. Likewise, “[n]othing in the\n5The majority’s approach is also directly contradicted by the D.C. Circuit. In\nMountain States Legal Foundation v. Bush, our sister circuit determined that “[n]o\nconstitutional . . . claim is before us, as the President exercised his delegated\npowers under the Antiquities Act,” precisely because “that statute includes\nintelligible principles to guide the President’s actions.” 306 F.3d 1132, 1137 (D.C.\nCir. 2002) (emphasis added). \n11\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 87 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 87 of 105\nlegislative history of [§ 8005] has been called to our attention indicating that\nCongress contemplated direct judicial enforcement.” Id. at 533. \nFurthermore, § 8005 is directed not at private parties or individuals, but at\nthe Secretary of Defense; creates no apparent individual rights, much less an\nindividual remedy; and “lacks the sort of rights-creating language needed to imply\na private right of action.” Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 135 S. Ct.\n1378, 1387 (2015).\n3. Plaintiffs have no APA Claim\nWith Dalton limiting our ability to construe Plaintiffs’ claim as alleging a\nconstitutional violation, and with no implied statutory cause of action to challenge\nthe agency’s action as a violation of § 8005, Plaintiffs are left with challenging the\nDoD’s reprogramming under the APA as an “abuse of discretion,” “not in\naccordance with law,” or “in excess of statutory jurisdiction.” See 5 U.S.C.\n§ 706(2)(A), (C). See Clouser v. Espy, 42 F.3d 1522, 1527 n.5 (9th Cir. 1994)\n(construing a plaintiff’s challenge to Forest Service rulings “as issued without\nstatutory authority” to be “a claim challenging agency action ‘in excess of statutory\njurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right’ under 5 U.S.C.\n§ 706(2)(C)”). However, although the APA is the proper vehicle for challenging\nthe DoD’s § 8005 reprogramming, Plaintiffs are not a proper party to bring such a\n12\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 88 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 88 of 105\nclaim, as they fall outside § 8005’s zone of interests. The majority errs by\nfashioning an equitable claim to bypass the APA’s limitations.\na. The APA is the Proper Vehicle for Challenging the DoD’s \nAction\nWhere a statute imposes obligations on a federal agency but “does not give\nrise to a ‘private’ right of action against the federal government[,] [a]n aggrieved\nparty may pursue its remedy under the APA.” San Carlos Apache Tribe v. United\nStates, 417 F.3d 1091, 1096–99 (9th Cir. 2005) (explaining how a federal action is\nnearly always reviewable under the APA for conformity with statutory obligations\neven absent a “private right of action”). In other words, the APA opens the door for\njudicial review provided: (1) the agency’s action is “final,” 5 U.S.C. § 704; (2) the\nstatute imposing obligations on the federal agency does not “preclude judicial\nreview,” id. § 701(a)(1); and (3) the agency action is not “committed to agency\ndiscretion by law,” id. § 701(a)(2). See Weyerhaeuser Co. v. U.S. Fish & Wildlife\nServ., 139 S. Ct. 361, 370 (2018). Each element is satisfied here.\nFirst, the agency’s action satisfies the test for “final agency action” for\npurposes of 5 U.S.C. § 704. The finality of an agency’s action turns on whether the\ndecision represents the “consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process”\nand whether it determines rights or obligations, or from which “legal consequences\nwill flow.” Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177–78 (1997) (citation omitted). After\n13\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 89 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 89 of 105\napproving the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) request for support\nunder 10 U.S.C. § 284, the Secretary of Defense concluded support could be\nfunded through the reprogramming of funds under § 8005. The Secretary found the\n§ 8005 criteria were met. Following the necessary procedures, the DoD transferred\nthe funds to the Drug Interdiction and Counter-Drug Activities, Defense,\nappropriation account. Because the DoD committed those funds for § 284(b)(7)\nsupport, “legal consequences [began to] flow.” See Bennett, 520 U.S. at 178\n(citation omitted). Indeed, Defendants acknowledge that the § 8005 transfer was\nnecessary for authorizing support under § 284 and constructing the wall.\nSecond, as explained above, § 8005 does not “preclude judicial review.” See\n5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(1). Further, neither party presented “clear and convincing\nevidence” that § 8005 precludes APA’s default remedy. See Abbott Labs. v.\nGardner, 387 U.S. 136, 140–41 (1967), abrogated on other grounds by Califano v.\nSanders, 430 U.S. 99 (1977).\nFinally, the DoD’s reprogramming of funds under § 8005 is not “committed\nto agency discretion by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2). Defendants do not argue to the\ncontrary, nor would such an argument succeed. The APA embodies a broad\npresumption of judicial review of agency action. Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 140–41.\nOut of concern that “legal lapses and violations occur, and especially so when they\n14\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 90 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 90 of 105\nhave no consequence,” Weyerhaeuser Co., 139 S. Ct. at 370 (quoting Mach\nMining, LLC v. EEOC, 135 S. Ct. 1645, 1652–53 (2015)), the Supreme Court\n“read[s] the [phrase ‘committed to agency discretion’] quite narrowly, restricting it\nto ‘those rare circumstances where the relevant statute is drawn so that a court\nwould have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency’s exercise\nof discretion.’” Id. (quoting Lincoln, 508 U.S. at 191).\nThe appropriation scheme governing § 8005 allows the DoD to reprogram\nfunds provided the transferred funds address “higher priority items, based on\nunforeseen military requirements, than those for which originally appropriated.”6\n§ 8005. And “in no case” may the Secretary use the funds “where the item for\nwhich reprogramming is requested has been denied by the Congress.” Id. Thus, we\ndo not confront one of those rare circumstances where a court would have no\nmeaningful standard for judging the agency’s exercise of discretion. See\nWeyerhaeuser, 139 S. Ct. at 371–72 (citing Lincoln, 508 U.S. at 191); accord\nCitizens to Pres. Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 413 (1971), abrogated\non other grounds by Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99 (1977). For example,\nwhether the “item” to be funded by the reprogrammed funds was “denied” by\nCongress turns on a meaningful question of statutory interpretation—i.e., what\n6 Section 9002 is subject to these same limitations.\n15\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 91 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 91 of 105\ndoes “item” and “denied” mean?7 This court is generally required to provide some\ndeference to such an interpretation, depending on the circumstance, see Chevron,\nU.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984); Skidmore v. Swift\n& Co., 323 U.S. 134 (1944),8 but the phrase undoubtedly places a judicially\nreviewable constraint on the DoD’s actions.\nb. Plaintiffs are Not the Proper Party to Bring an APA Claim\nHowever, to bring a valid APA claim, Plaintiffs must establish that they “fall\nwithin the zone of interests protected by the law invoked.” Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v.\nStatic Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 129 (2014) (citation omitted). They\nhave failed to do so.9 \n7Unlike in Lincoln, the appropriation scheme governing Plaintiffs’ claims\ndoes not involve a lump-sum appropriation designed with merely a general,\noverarching goal and no specific strings attached to the money. 508 U.S. at\n189–92.\n8In determining whether Defendants violated § 8005, we should defer to the\nDoD’s interpretation under Skidmore. See Alaska Dep’t of Envtl. Conservation v.\nEPA, 540 U.S. 461, 487 (2004). Skidmore deference operates like a sliding scale,\nmeaning the degree of deference we give the agency’s interpretation of a statute\n“depend[s] upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its\nreasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those\nfactors which give it power to persuade, if lacking power to control.” Skidmore,\n323 U.S. at 140. We also consider whether the agency has changed its position or\nwhether its interpretation “was framed for the specific purpose of aiding a party in\nthis litigation.” Fed. Express Corp. v. Holowecki, 552 U.S. 389, 400 (2008).\n9Because the majority concludes Plaintiffs’ APA claim is constitutional, we\n(continued...)\n16\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 92 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 92 of 105\nThe zone of interests test requires a court to determine whether, “in view of\nCongress’ evident intent to make agency action presumptively reviewable, a\nparticular plaintiff should be heard to complain of a particular agency decision.”\nClarke v. Sec. Indus.

Requirements Utils. v. FERC,\n9(...continued)\ndisagree as to what zone of interests applies. However, as a statutory claim,\nPlaintiffs must fall within the zone of interests of § 8005. They have failed to do\nso. Because this claim should not be viewed as a constitutional claim under the\nAppropriations Clause, it is not necessary to decide whether Plaintiffs could (or\nwould need to) fall within that zone of interests. \n17\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 93 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 93 of 105\n798 F.3d 796, 808 (9th Cir. 2015). “In cases where the plaintiff is not itself the\nsubject of the contested regulatory action, the test denies a right of review if the\nplaintiff’s interests are so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes\nimplicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress intended\nto permit the suit.” Clarke, 479 U.S. at 399. Even under this generous standard, we\nhave found certain APA claims fail the zone of interests test.10 See, e.g., Ashley\nCreek Phosphate Co. v. Norton, 420 F.3d 934, 940 (9th Cir. 2005) (“[P]urely\neconomic interests do not fall within [the National Environmental Policy Act’s\n(NEPA)] zone of interests” because “the zone of interests that NEPA protects [is]\nenvironmental.”); Havasupai Tribe v.

Requirements Utils., 798 F.3d at 809\n(determining zone of interests test not satisfied where the plaintiffs’ goals were\nlikely to frustrate rather than further statutory objectives).\n10Plaintiffs cite the D.C. Circuit’s decision in Scheduled Airlines Traffic\nOffices, Inc. v. Department of Defense, 87 F.3d 1356 (D.C. Cir. 1996) as\n“illustrat[ing] the expansive zone of interests for claims arising under statutes\nprotecting Congress’s control over appropriations decisions.” However, that case\nmerely applied the same zone of interests test that we do here to determine that the\nplaintiff’s economic interests were “sufficiently congruent” with the statute and fell\nwithin the zone of interests. Id. at 1360.\n18\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 94 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 94 of 105\nHere, Plaintiffs’ interests fall outside § 8005’s zone of interests. Section\n8005 operates only to authorize the Secretary of Defense to transfer previously-\nappropriated funds between DoD accounts, based upon certain conditions and\ncircumstances. This statute arguably protects Congress and those who would have\nbeen entitled to the funds as originally appropriated; and as a budgetary statute\nregarding the transfer of funds among DoD accounts, it arguably protects economic\ninterests. Plaintiffs have not asserted that they would have been entitled to the\nfunds but for the transfer, nor have they raised any other economic interests.\nRather, they assert aesthetic, recreational, and generalized environmental interests\nthat will be affected, not by the transfer of funds, but by the building of the border\nwall. Nothing in § 8005 requires that aesthetic, recreational, or environmental\ninterests be considered before a transfer is made, nor does the statute even address\nsuch interests. At best, Plaintiffs’ interests are only “marginally related to . . . the\npurposes implicit in the statute [such] that it cannot reasonably be assumed that\nCongress intended to permit the suit,” Clarke, 479 U.S. at 399, and they fall\noutside § 8005’s zone of interests. Thus, Plaintiffs may not bring this APA claim,\nbecause their interests are not protected by the relevant statute.\nc. The Existence of an APA Claim Also Precludes an Equitable \nConstitutional Claim\nEven though these Plaintiffs lack a cause of action under the APA, this court\n19\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 95 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 95 of 105\ncannot save their claim by fashioning an “equitable” work-around to assert a\nconstitutional claim, as the majority has done. Even if we ignored the discretion\n§ 8005 provides to the DoD and thus could reframe Plaintiffs’ claim as a\nconstitutional one, the APA’s “scope of review” provision would cover it. Those\nprovisions provide that a reviewing court shall:\n[H]old unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions\nfound to be—\n(A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not\nin accordance with law;\n(B) contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity;\n(C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or\nshort of statutory right[.]\n5 U.S.C. § 706(2) (emphasis added). Where courts can review an agency action\nunder the APA to ensure the agency has not abused its discretion, violated the\nConstitution, or otherwise operated outside its authority, we have no business\ndevising additional “equitable” causes of action. Here, an avenue for challenging\nthe DoD’s reprogramming action exists under the APA—just not for these\nPlaintiffs. Thus, there is no reason to resort to the extraordinary step of implying an\nequitable cause of action for these Plaintiffs. \nAs the majority recognizes, “[t]he ability to sue to enjoin unconstitutional\nactions by state and federal officers is the creation of courts of equity.” See \nArmstrong, 135 S. Ct. at 1384–85. However, this “judge-made remedy” does not\n20\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 96 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 96 of 105\nprovide courts the unfettered power to enjoin executive action; our power “is\nsubject to express and implied statutory limitations.” Id. at 1385. The majority\nignores this limitation, relying on inapposite cases to conclude that a federal\ncourt’s “equity” jurisdiction allows any would-be plaintiff to avoid proceeding\nunder the APA. Maj. Op. at 46–47. That the Supreme Court considered challenges\nto a president’s action in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579\n(1952) and Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392 (2018) lends the majority no support;\nthe APA does not apply to the President, see Dalton, 511 U.S. at 468, so no\nplaintiff would have an APA claim in those cases. Yet this case is about an agency\naction, and therefore the APA applies. Moreover, McIntosh arose in a very\ndifferent context; our court did not “allow[] an equitable action to enforce the\nAppropriations Clause,” Maj. Op. at 48, we considered the Appropriations Clause\nas a defense for criminal defendants indicted for federal marijuana offenses,\nMcIntosh, 833 F.3d at 1168 (“We are asked to decide whether criminal defendants\nmay avoid prosecution for various federal marijuana offenses on the basis of a\ncongressional appropriations rider that prohibits the United States Department of\nJustice from spending funds to prevent states’ implementation of their own medical\nmarijuana laws.”). Allowing defendants to invoke constitutional principles as a\ndefense is common, see, e.g., Bond v. United States, 564 U.S. 211, 225–26 (2011),\n21\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 97 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 97 of 105\nand distinguishable from the affirmative enforcement that the majority provides\nhere.11    \nThe majority’s reliance on Armstrong highlights its fundamental\nmisunderstanding of cases involving a court’s equitable power to enjoin acts\nviolating federal law. Maj. Op. at 52–53. Congress has not displaced the possibility\nof judge-made equitable remedies against federal agencies through the APA, see\nArmstrong, 135 S. Ct. at 1385, it codified judicial review of agency action.12 Cf. W.\nRadio Servs. Co. v. U.S. Forest Serv., 578 F.3d 1116, 1123 (9th Cir. 2009) (“The\nfact that APA’s procedures are available where no other adequate alternative\nremedy exists further indicates Congress’s intent that courts should not devise\n11The majority misunderstands my point about the distinguishing features of\nMcIntosh. Maj. Op. at 48. The question facing the McIntosh court was whether\ncriminal defendants could halt their prosecutions by attacking how the DOJ was\nfunding the prosecutions. 833 F.3d at 1172–73. All of the defendants “filed\nmotions to dismiss or to enjoin on the basis of the rider.” Id. at 1170. In granting\nrelief, the court stated that it “need not decide in the first instance exactly how the\ndistrict courts should resolve claims that the DOJ is spending money to prosecute a\ndefendant in violation of an appropriations rider. We therefore take no view on the\nprecise relief required and leave that issue to the district courts in the first\ninstance.” Id. at 1172 n.2. As such, McIntosh simply did not address or\ncontemplate an injunction to enjoin spending funds parallel to the pending criminal\nproceedings.\n12Without supporting authority, the majority even suggests that the\navailability of an equitable cause of action would preclude an APA claim under the\nAPA provision providing for judicial review when “there is no other adequate\nremedy in a court.” Maj. Op. at 57 (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 704).   \n22\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 98 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 98 of 105\nadditional, judicially crafted default remedies.”); San Carlos Apache Tribe, 417\nF.3d at 1096–97 (“[C]reating a direct private action against the federal government\nmakes little sense in light of the administrative review scheme set out in the\nAPA.”).13 \nThe majority’s failure to channel Plaintiffs’ claims through the APA’s\nframework for challenging agency action will inevitably lead to peculiar results.\nWhat prevents future plaintiffs from simply challenging any agency action\n“equitably,” thereby avoiding the APA’s limited judicial review under the\n“arbitrary and capricious” standard, so that a court may substitute its own judgment\nfor that of the agency? See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n. of\nUnited States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983). The\nmajority offers no reason to distort decades of administrative law practice to\nrecognize Plaintiffs’ “equitable” action when the APA provides for review of the\n13The majority’s reliance on Navajo Nation v. Department of the Interior,\n876 F.3d 1144 (9th Cir. 2017) and Presbyterian Church v. United States, 870 F.2d\n518 (9th Cir. 1989) is misplaced. Presbyterian Church reserved the determination\nof whether there was “agency action” within the meaning of the APA, 870 F.2d at\n525 n.8, meaning there was no “alternative” APA claim. Navajo Nation addressed\nthe limits of the APA’s waiver of sovereign immunity, but offered no guidance\nabout the propriety of bringing parallel claims espousing the same theory under\ntwo different causes of action (under the APA and “equitably”). 876 F.3d at\n1171–72. Thus, neither case stands for the proposition that, where (as here) an\nagency action is reviewable under the APA, Plaintiffs may bring a parallel\n“equitable” claim.\n23\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 99 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 99 of 105\nDoD’s reprogramming actions.\nAlthough it may seem unjust that Plaintiffs have no viable recourse for their\nasserted injuries, “[t]he judicial power of the United States conferred by Article III\nof the Constitution is upheld just as surely by withholding judicial relief where\nCongress has permissibly foreclosed it, as it is by granting such relief where\nauthorized by the Constitution or by statute.” Dalton, 511 U.S. at 477. Plaintiffs’\nrelief has been permissibly foreclosed here, and Defendants have accordingly\ndemonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the merits of their appeal.\nII.  The Other Relevant Factors Also Favor a Stay\nTo reemphasize, the issue before us is a motion to stay the district court’s\ninjunction under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 8. We are limited to decide\nonly whether a stay should be granted until the appeal on the merits is final.\nAlthough “[a] stay is not a matter of right, even if irreparable injury might\notherwise result,” it is “an exercise of judicial discretion, and the propriety of its\nissue is dependent upon the circumstances of the particular case.” Nken, 556 U.S.\nat 433 (citations, alteration, and quotation marks omitted). Here, the circumstances\nof this case merit our discretionary relief pending appeal. \nEven if Defendants had failed to show a strong likelihood of success on the\nmerits, they “may be entitled to prevail if [they] can demonstrate a ‘substantial case\n24\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 100 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 100 of 105\non the merits’ and the second and fourth factors [irreparable injury and public\ninterest] militate in [their] favor.” Winter, 502 F.3d at 863. Because Plaintiffs have\nno viable claim for relief, Defendants have more than demonstrated a substantial\ncase on the merits.14 Therefore, our panel must “give serious consideration” to the\nsecond and fourth factors. Id.\nAs to irreparable harm, Defendants argue that without a stay they will be\nprevented from ever using the enjoined funds to complete the identified projects\naddressed by the permanent injunction. Defendants are likely correct. The funding\nfor those projects will lapse on September 30th, and even if Defendants prevail in\nthis court’s final ruling, we could not order or permit Defendants to spend funds\ngranted in a lapsed appropriation. See, e.g., City of Houston v. Dep’t of Hous. &\nUrban Dev., 24 F.3d 1421, 1424, 1426–27 (D.C. Cir. 1994). No one appears to\ndispute that this will likely be the practical consequence if a stay is denied.\n14As to the discretionary standard of review, the district court did not apply\nthe second and fourth factors (for the short period of time for which this appeal\nwould be pending) to the request for the permanent injunction. Thus, its factual\nfindings are not clear as to the motion before us. It did have the occasion to apply\nthese two factors in its analysis of the stay of the preliminary injunction. However,\nin its analysis of that stay, it chose to ignore these factors, concluding that,\n“[b]ecause the Court finds that Defendants have not met their burden to make a\nstrong showing that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their appeal, the\nCourt need not further address the other Nken factors.” Sierra Club v. Trump, No.\n19-CV-00892-HSG, 2019 WL 2305341, at *2 n.2 (N.D. Cal. May 30, 2019). This\nconclusion was an abuse of discretion. See Winter, 502 F.3d at 862.\n25\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 101 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 101 of 105\nCongress may opt to appropriate new funds for these projects in the future, but that\npossibility is irrelevant. Simply, the permanent injunction will certainly render\nDefendants unable to use the funds at issue here under § 284(b)(7). Thus, there is a\n“possibility that . . . corrective relief will [not] be available at a later date, in the\nordinary course of litigation.” See Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 90 (1974).\nTherefore, Defendants have demonstrated that they will be irreparably injured if a\nstay is not issued. See id. \nAs to the public interest, Defendants argue that their interests in preventing\ndrug trafficking easily outweigh Plaintiffs’ aesthetic, recreational, and generalized\nenvironmental injuries. In the narrow context of this stay motion, Defendants are\ncorrect. Even though environmental injuries may be significant in the long term,\nthe injunction will only be stayed for a short period.15 If the DoD is precluded from\nobligating these funds in the 2019 fiscal year, it must forgo providing support\nunder § 284(b)(7). Defendants have adequately demonstrated that the public\ninterest weighs in their favor for supporting § 284(b)(7) for at least three reasons.16  \n15As previously noted, the parties have suggested that an expedited briefing\nschedule will be requested. Given the need for a timely resolution of this case, this\ncase should be resolved shortly.\n16Whether the district court appropriately balanced these interests when it\nissued the permanent injunction is not before us. Our inquiry is limited to the\nmotion to stay, and the final determination on the balance on interests is one that\n(continued...)\n26\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 102 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 102 of 105\nFirst, no one disputes that Defendants have broad authority to carry out a\nvariety of actions aimed at disrupting the cross-border flow of narcotics in the\naffected areas. Cf. United States v. Guzman-Padilla, 573 F.3d 865, 889 (9th Cir.\n2009). Nor does anyone dispute that Defendants are authorized by statute to\nconstruct fencing and other barriers for that purpose in the areas at issue in this\nlawsuit. See 10 U.S.C. § 284(b)(7). Nor even does anyone seriously dispute the\nDoD’s determination that drug trafficking along our southern border (including in\nthe project areas at issue here) threatens the safety and security of our nation and\nits citizens. See Winter, 502 F.3d at 862 (“We customarily give considerable\ndeference to the Executive Branch’s judgment regarding foreign policy and\nnational defense.” (citing Dep’t of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 529 (1988))); see\nalso Franklin, 505 U.S. at 818. Given this significant national security interest, the\npublic would benefit more from a stay that—while this appeal is pending—permits\nDefendants to effect the policies that it has determined are necessary to minimize\nthat threat, than it would from a decision that hampers Defendants’ ability to\ncombat this threat throughout the present appellate process.17\n16(...continued)\nthe merits panel will ultimately decide.\n17The record does not reflect that Congress “denied” funding under § 284.\nThe funds at issue here will be used solely to “provide support for the counterdrug\n(continued...)\n27\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 103 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 103 of 105\nSecond, if the injunction is allowed to remain in effect, it will, for reasons\noutlined above, potentially cause irreparable harm to Defendants. On the other\nhand, the irreparable harm to Plaintiffs during this relatively short period (if a stay\nis granted) is less clear. Defendants have represented to this court that the projects\nat issue are needed to protect national security and must go forward even if there is\na possibility that a merits panel may eventually order them to remove whatever\nwas constructed while a stay was in place. This is not the sort of determination that\ncourts will ordinarily second guess. See Winter, 502 F.3d at 862; Franklin, 505\nU.S. at 818 (recognizing “the principle of judicial deference that pervades the area\nof national security”); see also Munaf v. Geren, 553 U.S. 674, 689 (2008) (“We\ntherefore approach these questions cognizant that ‘courts traditionally have been\n17(...continued)\nactivities.” § 284. The fact that there were numerous discussions surrounding the\nbuilding of a wall, during the budgetary negotiations and the shut down of the\ngovernment, does not alter what Congress set forth in its appropriations bill for the\nDoD. See Salazar v. Ramah Navajo Chapter, 567 U.S. 182, 200 (2012) (“An\nagency’s discretion to spend appropriated funds is cabined only by the ‘text of the\nappropriation,’ not by Congress’ expectations of how the funds will be spent, as\nmight be reflected by legislative history.” (citation omitted)). Nowhere in the DoD\nAppropriations Act are there limitations on its ability to act under § 284. Moreover,\nthe transfer of funds stays within the DoD’s allotted appropriations and does not\nincrease the appropriations of the DHS. Even if we should look to all appropriation\nacts, the only limitations placed on the DHS “for the construction of pedestrian\nfencing” were for geographic areas and “funds made available by this Act or prior\nActs.” See Pub. L. No. 116-6, § 231, 133 Stat. 13, 28. see also id. § 232.\n28\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 104 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 104 of 105\nreluctant to intrude upon the authority of the Executive in military and national\nsecurity affairs.’” (quoting Egan, 484 U.S. at 530)). It is difficult to determine that\nPlaintiffs’ inability to recreate in and otherwise enjoy this public land would\noutweigh the claimed national interests during the limited period of time the\nrequested stay would be in place—especially considering Plaintiffs do not have a\nviable cause of action to challenge Defendants’ actions under § 8005.\nThird, the district court’s reasoning that the public interest does not favor\nDefendants, because the public has a generalized interest in ensuring that the\nExecutive acts within the limits imposed by statute and by the Constitution, simply\nbegs the question. If a court accepts the premise that Defendants exceeded\nstatutory or constitutional limitations on its authority, then the public has an\ninterest in seeing that the Executive Branch is “reined in.” However, if Defendants\nshow that they did not exceed those bounds, then the public interest articulated by\nPlaintiffs and the district court has no merit. Moreover, when considering whether\nto grant a stay, the public interest factor cannot rise or fall on how the appeal is\nultimately resolved on its merits. That analysis would collapse the public interest\nfactor into the first element of the four-part test. \nIn conclusion, because Defendants have more than demonstrated a\nsubstantial case on the merits, and because the second and fourth factors “militate\n29\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 105 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 105 of 105\nin [their] favor,” we should exercise our discretion and issue a stay pending the\nappeal of the district court’s permanent injunction. See Winter, 502 F.3d at 863. It\nmakes little sense to tie Defendants’ hands while the appellate process plays out,\nespecially given Plaintiffs’ lack of a viable claim and given the national security\nconsiderations present in this case.\n30",

However, in light of Defendants’ notification on February 13, 2020, that \n7 the Department of Defense intends to fund and construct additional border barrier projects in \n8 fiscal year 2020 as soon as March 15, 2020, relying on identical statutory authorities as those \n9 examined by this Court, the parties anticipate litigating these new projects shortly.  The parties \n10 agree that it would be more efficient for this litigation to be addressed in the context of the current \n11 civil actions given the extensive history of these cases and the parties’ expectation that litigation \n12 over the fiscal year 2020 projects will likely involve many of the same issues as the prior \n13 litigation. \n14 To avoid any potential procedural complications with the pending appeals by continuing \n15 to litigate these matters in the above-captioned cases, the parties agree that Plaintiffs will bring \n16 the new challenges to Defendants’ actions as to fiscal year 2020 by amending the currently \n17 operative complaints to include new claims addressing the 2020 actions.   \n18 For these reasons, the parties respectfully request that these cases remain open to litigate \n19 Plaintiffs’ anticipated challenges to Defendants’ funding and construction of border barrier \n20 projects in fiscal year 2020.   \n21  \n22  \n23 DATE:  February 14, 2020      Respectfully submitted, \n \n24                \nDAVID M.

The House has a compelling institutional interest \n4  in the Court’s grant of expedited relief prohibiting defendants from spending federal funds without \n5  a  valid  appropriation.    This  case  arises  out  defendants’  flagrant  disregard  for  the  bedrock \n6  constitutional principle that “[n]o Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of \n7  Appropriations made by Law.”  U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 7.  The Appropriations Clause vests \n8  Congress with “exclusive power over the federal purse,” and it is “one of the most important \n9  authorities allocated to Congress in the Constitution’s ‘necessary partition of power among the \n10  several departments.’”  U.S. Dep’t of the Navy v. FLRA, 665 F.3d 1339, 1346 (D.C. Cir. 2012) \n11  (quoting The Federalist No. 51 (James Madison)).  Notwithstanding this clear constitutional \n12  command, on the same day that President Trump signed legislation providing only $1.375 billion \n13  for the construction of barriers along the southern border, he announced that his Administration \n14  would in fact spend up to $8.1 billion.1  To support this expenditure, President Trump declared a \n15  national emergency, despite acknowledging that whether the amount spent is “$8 billion or $2 \n16  billion or $1.5 billion, it’s going to build a lot of wall” and stating that “I didn’t need to do this.”2  \n17  This decision to build a border wall in the absence of a valid appropriation usurps Congress’s \n18  authority under the Appropriations Clause. \n19  Attempting to paper over its unconstitutional expenditure of funds, the Administration \n20  incorrectly asserts the authority to spend billions of dollars on a border wall under three separate \n21  statutory provisions: (1) “[a]bout $601 million from the Treasury Forfeiture Fund”; (2) “[u]p to \n22  $2.5 billion under the Department of Defense funds transferred for Support for Counterdrug \n23  Activities,” 10 U.S.C. § 284; and (3) “[u]p to $3.6 billion reallocated from Department of Defense \n24 \n                                                           \n1 See Fact Sheet: President Donald J.

Reg. 4949 \n(Feb. 20, 2019) (National Emergency Proclamation). \n28 \n \n \n  1   \nBRIEF OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AS AMICUS CURIAE (4:19-cv-00892-HSG) \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 47   Filed 04/15/19   Page 6 of 23\n \n1  military construction projects under the President’s declaration of a national emergency,” 10 U.S.C. \n2  § 2808.3  As discussed below, two of the provisions on which the Administration purports to rely \n3  to spend up to $6.1 billion provide no authority for such expenditures – and, absent a valid \n4  Congressional appropriation, those expenditures violate the Appropriations Clause. \n5  First, defendants’ expenditure of up to $2.5 billion on the construction of a border wall \n6  under 10 U.S.C. § 284 violates the Appropriations Clause.  Section 284 authorizes the Secretary of \n7  Defense to construct fences to block drug smuggling corridors along the border.  The House \n8  understands that most of the fiscal year 2019 funding Congress appropriated for such purposes has \n9  already been used.  Thus, defendants plan to spend nearly $2.5 billion that Congress appropriated \n10  for other purposes on the construction of a border wall under the section – and defendants have \n11  already transferred $1 billion for such construction and awarded contracts against this funding.  \n12  Defendants claim that section 8005 of the 2019 Department of Defense Appropriations Act \n13  authorizes the transfer of these funds.  However, that section only authorizes transfers for “higher \n14  priority items, based on unforeseen military requirements” and “in no case where the item for which \n15  funds requested has been denied by Congress.”  In this case, the transfers are not based on \n16  “unforeseen military requirements,” and President Trump’s request for up to $5 billion for a border \n17  wall was “denied by Congress.”  Notably, section 8005 also excludes transfers for purposes of \n18  “military construction.” \n19  Second, defendants’ expenditure of up to $3.6 billion on the construction of a border wall \n20  under 10 U.S.C. § 2808 violates the Appropriations Clause.  Section 2808(a) provides that, when \n21  the President declares a national emergency, the Secretary of Defense may redirect unobligated \n22  military construction funds to other projects subject to three specific limitations: (1) there must be \n23  a national emergency “that requires the use of the armed forces,” (2) the funding must be spent on \n24  a “military construction project,” and (3) the project must be “necessary to support [the] use of the \n25  armed forces.”  Here, the Administration’s border wall fails all three conditions: there is no \n26  emergency that requires the use of the armed forces, and, even if there were, a border wall is not \n27  necessary to support the use of the armed forces.  In addition, a border wall is not a “military \n                                                           \n28  3 See Border Victory Fact Sheet, http://tinyurl.com/WHBorderVictory. \n \n  2   \nBRIEF OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AS AMICUS CURIAE (4:19-cv-00892-HSG) \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 47   Filed 04/15/19   Page 7 of 23\n \n1  construction project.”  As noted above, the justification for defendants’ transfer of funds under \n2  section 8005 depends on the argument that the border wall does not constitute military construction. \n3  Underscoring the Administration’s disregard for the Constitution, Mick Mulvaney, Acting \n4  White House Chief of Staff and Director of the Office of Management and Budget, recently stated \n5  that the wall “is going to get built with or without Congress.”4  The Appropriations Clause dictates, \n6  however, that defendants may only spend money to build a wall with Congress.  Even the monarchs \n7  of England long ago lost the power to raise and spend money without the approval of Parliament.5 \n8  Plaintiffs are therefore very likely to succeed on the merits of their claims that defendants \n9  are unconstitutionally transferring and spending funds under sections 284 and 2808(a) on the \n10  construction of a border wall.  Because “the Constitution is the ultimate expression of the public \n11  interest,” Gordon v. Holder, 721 F.3d 638, 653 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (quotation marks omitted), and \n12  “all citizens have a stake in upholding the Constitution,” Hernandez v. Sessions, 872 F.3d 976, 996 \n13  (9th  Cir.  2017)  (quotation  marks  omitted),  this  Court  should issue  a preliminary  injunction \n14  prohibiting defendants from spending funds on the construction of a border wall in the absence of \n15  a valid Congressional appropriation.6 \n16  ARGUMENT \nTHE  COURT  SHOULD  ISSUE  A  PRELIMINARY  INJUNCTION  PROHIBITING \n17 \nDEFENDANTS FROM SPENDING FUNDS ON A BORDER WALL WITHOUT A VALID \nAPPROPRIATION \n18 \n19  “Decisions of the Supreme Court and this Court have strictly enforced the constitutional \n20  requirement . . . that uses of appropriated funds be authorized by Congress.”  FLRA, 665 F.3d at \n21  1342; see also City & Cty. of San Francisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1231 (9th Cir. 2018).  Indeed, \n22 \n                                                           \n23  4 Andrew O’Reilly, Mulvaney Says Border Wall Will Get Built, ‘With or Without’ Funding \nfrom Congress, Fox News (Feb. 10, 2019), https://tinyurl.com/MulvaneyFoxNewsSunday. \n24  5  See  The  Civil  War:  The  Long  Parliament,  U.K.  Parliament, \nhttps://tinyurl.com/UKLongParliament  (last  visited  Apr.  10,  2019)  (discussing  Parliament’s \n25 \ncondemnation of King Charles I’s “personal rule” from 1629-1640 and Parliament’s declaration in \nthe 1640s that nonparliamentary taxation would be illegal). \n26 \n6 On April 5, 2019, the House filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of \n27  Columbia, seeking redress for its injury caused by defendants’ unconstitutional actions.  See U.S. \nHouse of Representatives v. Mnuchin, 1:19-cv-00969 (D.D.C.).  The House submits this amicus \n28  brief in further defense of its constitutional authority. \n \n  3   \nBRIEF OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AS AMICUS CURIAE (4:19-cv-00892-HSG) \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 47   Filed 04/15/19   Page 8 of 23\n \n1  the Executive Branch cannot buy so much as a single plank of wood without a valid appropriation.  \n2  See FLRA, 665 F.3d at 1346-47.  In considering whether defendants’ proposed expenditures comply \n3  with Congress’s specific statutory limitations, “it is the court that has the last word and it should \n4  not shrink from exercising its power.”  Delta Data Sys. Corp. v. Webster, 744 F.2d 197, 202 (D.C. \n5  Cir. 1984) (quotation marks and punctuation omitted); accord FLRA, 665 F.3d at 1349.  As \n6  explained below, defendants’ expenditure of funds under sections 284 and 2808 on the construction \n7  of a border wall has not been authorized by Congress.  In the absence of a valid Congressional \n8  appropriation, these transfers and expenditures violate the Appropriations Clause.  The Court \n9  should enjoin defendants’ unconstitutional activities.  Plaintiffs’ request for preliminary injunctive \n10  relief is particularly urgent given that defendants have begun awarding contracts to construct a \n11  border wall without a valid appropriation. \n12  A.  Congress Did Not Appropriate $8.1 Billion for a Border Wall \n13  Congress decidedly rejected President Trump’s request for $5 billion to build a border wall.  \n14  Indeed,  Congress’s  rejection  of  President  Trump’s  request  precipitated  the  longest  Federal \n15  Government shutdown in history.  In the absence of a valid appropriation, the Administration’s \n16  expenditure of funds on the construction of a border wall plainly violates the Appropriations \n17  Clause.

Pub \n4  L. No. 116-6 (2019) (to be printed at 133 Stat. 13).  The Act appropriated $1.375 billion for \n5  construction of fencing in the Rio Grande Valley area of the border but provided that in that area \n6  “[n]one of the funds made available by this Act or prior Acts are available for the construction of \n7  pedestrian fencing – (1) within the Santa Ana Wildlife Refuge; (2) within the Bentsen-Rio Grande \n8  Valley State Park; (3) within La Lomita Historical Park; (4) within the National Butterfly Center; \n9  or (5) within or east of the Vista del Mar Ranch tract of the Lower Rio Grande Valley National \n10  Wildlife Refuge.”  Id. § 231, 133 Stat. 28.  Congress limited the funding for new fencing to \n11  “operationally effective designs” that had been deployed as of 2017, “such as currently deployed \n12  steel bollard designs, that prioritize agent safety.”  Id. § 230(b), 133 Stat. 28.  No other funding was \n13  designated for the construction of a border wall. \n14  On February 15, 2019, President Trump signed the 2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act \n15  into law.26  Yet, on the same day he signed the Act, President Trump expressed his dissatisfaction \n16  with the $1.375 billion that Congress had appropriated and announced that his Administration \n17  would instead spend up to $8.1 billion on construction of a border wall.27  To use the words of Mr. \n18  Mulvaney, the Administration decided to build the wall “without Congress.”28 \n19  Simply put, this is emphatically not how the Constitution designed the appropriations \n20  process to operate: the Appropriations Clause dictates that defendants may only spend funds to \n21  build a border wall with Congress.

Defendants’ Asserted Authority Does Not Excuse Their Expenditure of Funds on \na Border Wall in the Absence of a Valid Appropriation \n4 \n5  Defendants attempt to avoid the constitutional requirements by asserting the authority to \n6  spend “[u]p to $2.5 billion under the Department of Defense funds transferred for Support for \n7  Counterdrug Activities,” 10 U.S.C. § 284, and “[u]p to $3.6 billion reallocated from Department of \n8  Defense military construction projects under the President’s declaration of a national emergency,” \n9  10 U.S.C. § 2808.29  However, these statutory provisions do not authorize such expenditures, and \n10  therefore provide no justification for the Administration’s blatant circumvention of Congress’s \n11  constitutional authority over appropriations. \n12 \n1.  Defendants’ Transfer and Expenditure of $2.5 Billion under Section 284 on a \nBorder Wall Violates the Appropriations Clause \n13 \n14  Defendants are not authorized to spend up to $2.5 billion of transferred funds under section \n15  284 on the construction of a border wall.  Section 284(a) provides that “[t]he Secretary of Defense \n16  may provide support for the counterdrug activities . . . of any other department or agency of the \n17  federal government” if “such support is requested[] by the official who has responsibility for the \n18  counterdrug activities . . . of the department or agency of the Federal Government[.]”  10 U.S.C. \n19  § 284(a), (a)(1)(A).  Section 284(b) further provides that “[t]he purposes for which the Secretary \n20  may provide support” include “[c]onstruction of roads and fences and installation of lighting to \n21  block drug smuggling corridors across international boundaries of the United States.”  Id. § 284(b), \n22  (b)(7).  Authority under this section does not depend on the President declaring a national \n23  emergency. \n24  For fiscal year 2019, Congress appropriated $517.171 million to the Drug Interdiction and \n25  Counterdrug Activities appropriation fund (drug interdiction fund), which is the source of funding \n26  for counter-narcotics support under section 284.

L. No. 115-245, div. A, tit. VI (2018) (to be printed at 132 Stat. 2981, 2997).  The House \n2  understands that most of this funding has already been used.  To spend up to $2.5 billion under \n3  section 284, defendants plan to first transfer funds that Congress appropriated for other purposes \n4  into the drug interdiction fund.30  On March 25, 2019, defendants transferred an initial batch of $1 \n5  billion from funds that Congress appropriated for military personnel costs to the drug interdiction \n6  fund.31  And on April 9, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) notified the House that contracts \n7  have been awarded against this funding.32  DOD has also announced that “[t]hese funds will be \n8  used to support DHS’s request to build 57 miles of 18-foot-high pedestrian fencing, constructing \n9  and improving roads, and installing lighting within the Yuma and El Paso Sectors of the border[.]”33 \n10  It is a fundamental principle of appropriations law that “[a]n amount available under law \n11  may be withdrawn from one appropriation account and credited to another or to a working fund \n12  only when authorized by law.”  31 U.S.C. § 1532 (emphasis added).  Defendants incorrectly claim \n13  that section 8005 of the 2019 Department of Defense Appropriations Act authorizes the transfers \n14  here.  In pertinent part, section 8005 provides that \n15  [u]pon determination by the Secretary of Defense that such action is necessary in \nthe national interest, he may, with the approval of the Office of Management and \n16  Budget, transfer not to exceed $4,000,000,000 of working capital funds of the \nDepartment of Defense or funds made available in this Act to the Department of \n17  Defense  for  military  functions  (except  military  construction)  between  such \nappropriations or funds or any subdivision thereof, to be merged with and to be \n18  available for the same purposes, and for the same time period, as the appropriation \nor fund to which transferred: Provided, That such authority to transfer may not be \n19  used unless for higher priority items, based on unforeseen military requirements, \nthan those for which originally appropriated and in no case where the item for which \n20  funds are requested has been denied by the Congress. \n21  Pub. L. No. 115-245, § 8005, 132 Stat. 2981, 2999.  Three limitations on the transfer authority \n22  provided by this section independently preclude defendants from transferring funds – including the \n23  $1 billion already transferred – to construct a border wall. \n                                                           \n24 \n30 See Border Victory Fact Sheet, http://tinyurl.com/WHBorderVictory. \n31 See Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), DOD Serial No. FY 19-01 \n25 \nRA, Reprogramming Action (Mar. 25, 2019), https://tinyurl.com/March25Transfer. \n26  32 See Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Def., Contracts for April 9, 2019 (Apr. 9, 2019), \nhttp://tinyurl.com/DoDApril9Contracts. \n27  33 Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Def., DOD Authorizes Support to Counter Drug Border \nSecurity (Mar. 25, 2019), http://tinyurl.com/DoDMarch25PressRelease. \n28 \n \n \n  9   \nBRIEF OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AS AMICUS CURIAE (4:19-cv-00892-HSG) \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 47   Filed 04/15/19   Page 14 of 23\n \n1    First, section 8005 only authorizes transfers of funds “for higher priority items, based on \n2  unforeseen military requirements.”  Congress included this limitation to confine DOD’s transfer \n3  authority to situations where unanticipated circumstances justify a departure from Congress’s \n4  previously authorized spending.  For example, in the past, DOD has used this authority to transfer \n5  funds to pay for unexpected hurricane and typhoon damage to bases.34  Here, defendants’ supposed \n6  need to transfer money clearly does not arise from unforeseen circumstances.  President Trump has \n7  been demanding $5 billion for a border wall since summer 2018,35 and he has been complaining \n8  about a supposed crisis at the border since the start of his campaign.36  Defendants’ alleged need to \n9  build a border wall was therefore entirely foreseen – Congress simply disagreed with President \n10  Trump’s opinion that $5 billion for a border wall was necessary and proper. \n11  Second, section 8005 does not authorize the transfer of funds in cases “where the item for \n12  which funds are requested has been denied by the Congress.”  The “denied by the Congress” \n13  restriction  was  added  to  DOD’s  transfer  authority  starting  in  fiscal  year  1974,  to  “tighten \n14  congressional control of the reprogramming process.”  H. Rep. No. 93-662, at 16 (1973); see Pub. \n15  L. No. 93-238, § 735, 87 Stat. 1026, 1044 (1974).  The House committee report on the 1974 \n16  appropriations bill explained that “[n]ot frequently, but on some occasions, the Department ha[d] \n17  requested that funds which have been specifically deleted in the legislative process be restored \n18  through the reprogramming process,” and that “[t]he Committee believe[d] that to concur in such \n19  actions would place committees in the position of undoing the work of the Congress.”  H. Rep. No. \n20  93-662, at 16.  Indeed, of considerable significance here, the Committee stated that such a position \n21  would be “untenable.”  Id.  Consistent with its purpose, this sort of appropriations restriction is \n22  intended  to  be  “construed  strictly”  to  “prevent  the  funding  for  programs  which  have  been \n23  considered by Congress and for which funding has been denied.”  See H. Rep.

L. No. 99-169, § 502(b), 99 Stat. \n2  1005 (codified at 50 U.S.C. § 3094(b))). \n3  In the striking factual circumstances surrounding the Administration’s repeated demands \n4  for border wall funding – which culminated in the longest Federal Government shutdown in history \n5  – Congress’s rejection of President Trump’s request for $5 billion for a border wall was absolutely \n6  clear.  See supra section A.  DOD’s use of its transfer authority to restore the funds “which have \n7  been considered by Congress and . . . denied,” H. Rep. No. 99-106, at 9, is therefore “untenable,” \n8  H. Rep. No. 93-662, at 16. \n9  Finally, section 8005 does not authorize transfers for “military construction.”  Section \n10  2801(a) provides that “[t]he term ‘military construction’ as used in this chapter or any other \n11  provision of law includes any construction development, conversion, or extension of any kind \n12  carried out with respect to a military installation.”  10 U.S.C. § 2801(a).  For the reasons set forth \n13  in the next section, the construction of a border wall does not constitute “military construction” \n14  because the border is not a “military installation.”  If, however, the Court were to hold that the \n15  construction of a border wall does constitute “military construction” – as defendants appear to urge \n16  by invoking section 2808(a) – then defendants’ transfer of funds is not authorized under section \n17  8005. \n18  Accordingly, defendants’ transfer and expenditure of up to $2.5 billion to construct a border \n19  wall under section 284 is unauthorized and violates the Appropriations Clause. \n20 \n2.  Defendants’ Expenditure of $3.6 Billion under Section 2808 on a Border Wall \nViolates the Appropriations Clause \n21 \n22  Defendants are likewise not authorized to spend up to $3.6 billion on the construction of a \n23  border wall under section 2808.  In full, section 2808(a) provides that \n24  [i]n the event of a declaration of war or the declaration by the President of a national \nemergency in accordance with the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et \n25  seq.) that requires use of the armed forces, the Secretary of Defense, without regard \nto any other provision of law, may undertake military construction projects, and may \n26  authorize  the  Secretaries  of  the  military  departments  to  undertake  military \nconstruction projects, not otherwise authorized by law that are  necessary to support \n27  such use of the armed forces.  Such projects may be undertaken only within the total \namount of funds that have been appropriated for military construction, including \n28  funds appropriated for family housing, that have not been obligated. \n \n  11   \nBRIEF OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AS AMICUS CURIAE (4:19-cv-00892-HSG) \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 47   Filed 04/15/19   Page 16 of 23\n \n1  10 U.S.C. § 2808(a).  Defendants may not rely on section 2808(a) here because they comply with \n2  none of its limitations. \n3  The House does not dispute that the President has declared a national emergency pursuant \n4  to the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. § 1601 et seq., a threshold requirement under section \n5  2808(a).  However, even where the President has declared a national emergency, section 2808(a) \n6  sets forth three independent limitations on the expenditure of funds: (1) there must be a national \n7  emergency “that requires the use of the armed forces,” (2) the funding must be spent on a “military \n8  construction project,” and (3) the project must be “necessary to support the use of the armed \n9  forces.”  10 U.S.C. § 2808(a). \n10  First, there is no national emergency “that requires the use of the armed forces.”  President \n11  Trump’s  emergency  proclamation  recognizes  that  the  “problem  of  large-scale  unlawful \n12  migration . . . is longstanding.”37  Although the proclamation also states that “[t]he southern border \n13  is a major entry point for criminals, gang members, and illicit narcotics,”38 border security is a \n14  matter for domestic law enforcement.39  Indeed, that is precisely the job that Congress has tasked \n15  and equipped Customs and Border Protection (CBP) – not the armed forces – to do.40  CBP is the \n16  “largest federal law enforcement agency in the United States,” and its mission is to “safeguard \n17  America’s borders.”41  Not only is it CBP’s job to ensure the security of the nation’s borders, but \n18  the military is expressly prohibited by the Posse Comitatus Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1385,42 from making \n19  “direct active use of Federal troops” to execute domestic law.

It cannot be credibly maintained that the \n2  armed forces are “required” to address the current supposed emergency.  In fact, the Acting \n3  Secretary of Defense recently admitted that the situation at the southern border is “not a military \n4  threat.”43 \n5  President Trump’s proclamation claims that the situation at the border has “worsened” due \n6  to “sharp increases in the number of family units entering and seeking entry to the United States \n7  and an inability to provide detention space.”44  However, this trend has been apparent for years,45 \n8  and the humanitarian issues it raises are a matter for the domestic law enforcement agencies,46 not \n9  the armed forces.  Congress has equipped CBP to address the needs of these families, such as by \n10  providing for family case management, supporting alternatives to detention, and increasing the \n11  number of immigration judges.47  In addition, Congress’s fiscal year 2019 appropriation for CBP \n12  provided  “$14.959  billion  for  [CBP’s  budget],  $942  million  more  than  fiscal  year  2018,” \n13  specifically to fund 600 additional CBP officers, and nearly half a billion dollars “to address \n14  humanitarian concerns at the border, including medical care, more efficient transportation, and \n15  holding facility requirements with better conditions and services for migrants.”48  As President \n16 \n17 \n                                                           \n18  43 Department of Defense Budget Posture: Hearing Before the S.

L. No. 116-6 (FY 2019 CBP appropriations), with Pub. L. No. 115-141 \n(FY 2018 CBP appropriations).  See generally H. Rep.

See  10  U.S.C.  § 2801(b)  (defining  “military  construction  project”  as  “all  military \n5  construction work . . . necessary to produce a complete and usable facility or a complete and usable \n6  improvement  to  an  existing  facility[.]”  (emphasis  added)).    The  statute  defines  “military \n7  construction project” with reference to the specifically defined term “military construction,” which \n8  includes “any construction, development, conversion, or extension of any kind carried out with \n9  respect to a military installation.”  Id. § 2801(a).50  And a “military installation” is defined to mean \n10  “a base, camp, post, station, yard, center, or other activity under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of \n11  a military department.” 51  Id. § 2801(c)(4).  Thus, a “military construction project” is “military \n12  construction work” “carried out with respect to a military installation” – i.e., “a base, camp, post, \n13  station,  yard,  center,  or  other  activity  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Secretary  of  a  military \n14  department.” \n15  In this case, the border wall is not a “military construction project” because it is not “carried \n16  out with respect to a military installation.”52  The southern border is clearly not a “base, camp, post, \n17  station, yard, [or] center.”  Nor is it some “other activity under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of \n18  a military department.”  “[W]here general words follow specific words in a statutory enumeration, \n19  the general words are  construed to embrace only  objects similar in nature to those  objects \n20  enumerated by the preceding specific words.”  Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U.S. 105, \n                                                           \n21  49 See Feb. 15 Rose Garden Remarks, http://tinyurl.com/TrumpRoseGardenRemarks. \n50 Section 2801(a) further states that military construction includes “any acquisition of land \n22 \nor construction of a defense access road (as described in section 210 of title 23).”  \n23  51 This is the definition applicable to domestic military installations.  “[I]n the case of an \nactivity in a foreign country,” the activity must be “under the operational control of the Secretary \n24  of a military department or the Secretary of Defense.”  10 U.S.C. § 2801(c)(4). \n52 Previous projects under section 2808 have included the construction of barracks hangars \n25 \nand improvements to airfield runways.  See Michael J. Vassalotti & Brendan W. McGarry, Cong. \nResearch Serv., IN11017, Military Construction Funding in the Event of a National Emergency 2 \n26 \n(2019), https://tinyurl.com/CRS-MilConFunding (listing all military construction projects under \n27  section 2808(a) between 2001 and 2014).  Notably – with the exception of one project related to \n“[s]ecurity measures for weapons of mass destruction” – every project carried out under section \n28  2808(a) has occurred abroad.  See id. at 2-3. \n \n  14   \nBRIEF OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AS AMICUS CURIAE (4:19-cv-00892-HSG) \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 47   Filed 04/15/19   Page 19 of 23\n \n1  114-15 (2001) (quotation marks omitted).  Thus, for the southern border to qualify as some “other \n2  activity under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of a military department” for purposes of section \n3  2808(a), it must be “similar in nature” to a military “base, camp, post, station, yard, [or] center.”  \n4  The southern border of the United States obviously is like none of these places. \n5  Defendants’ use of section 284 to build a border wall confirms that such construction does \n6  not constitute “military construction.”  As explained earlier, section 8005 does not authorize \n7  transfers for purposes of “military construction,” see supra pp. 16-17, and defendants therefore \n8  appear to concede that a border wall does not constitute military construction by invoking this \n9  transfer authority to justify their transfer and expenditure of $2.5 billion.  The Administration \n10  cannot have it both ways: section 2808 prohibits reprogramming except for military construction \n11  projects, while section 8005 prohibits the transfer of funds for military construction.  Moreover, \n12  section 284 authorizes the Secretary of Defense to construct fencing along the border only to \n13  “provide support for the counterdrug activities . . . of any other department or agency of the Federal \n14  Government” and only if “such support is requested . . . by the official who has responsibility” for \n15  such activities.  10 U.S.C. § 284(a) (emphasis added).  But if the border were “similar in nature” to \n16  a “base, camp, post, station, yard, [or] center,” it would make little sense for Congress to have \n17  limited the Secretary of Defense to constructing fencing only at the request of another agency. \n18  Finally, a border wall is not “necessary to support [the] use of the armed forces.”  Over the \n19  last year, President Trump has ordered a few thousand troops to assist DHS and CBP at the border.53  \n20  Consistent with the Posse Comitatus Act, see supra p. 18, these troops are strictly limited to a \n21  supporting role.  They do not actively participate in law enforcement efforts but instead provide \n22  assistance such as “aerial reconnaissance, ground surveillance, search and rescue support and \n23  medical support.”54  There is no reason a border wall is “necessary” to support the troops in their \n24 \n25 \n                                                           \n26  53 See Jim Garamone, Additional Personnel to Deploy to Southwest Border, U.S. Dep’t of \nDef.

I.N.S. \n5  v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 195 (1984).  Defendants’ expenditure of section 2808(a) funds \n6  circumvents the will of Congress and insults our “tripartite scheme of government” in which it is \n7  “up to Congress” to control the federal purse.  Id. at 196.  Indeed, Congress’s rejection of President \n8  Trump’s requested $5 billion for the construction of a border wall could not have been clearer. \n9  Nor should the Court “stretch th[e] words [of section 2808(a)’s three limitations] beyond \n10  their normal meaning” to excuse defendants’ transgression.  Schneider v. Smith, 390 U.S. 17, 27 \n11  (1968).  Section 2808 is one of scores of statutes that the President may invoke by declaring a \n12  national emergency under the National Emergencies Act.56  That statute was enacted in 1976 “to \n13  reform the existing maze of statutes which has resulted from the states of emergency under which \n14  the country has been operating for over 40 years.”57  The National Emergencies Act was “not \n15  intended to grant additional authority to the President,” but instead to make clear that “[t]he \n16  President can only exercise those powers delegated to him in other statutes.”  S. Rep. 94-1168, at \n17  4 (1976); accord H. Rep. 94-238, at 5-6 (1975).  That is why the Act itself “ma[de] no attempt to \n18  define when a declaration of national emergency is proper.”  S. Rep. 94-1168, at 3.  Rather, “[t]he \n19  circumstances authorizing a declaration of national emergency are defined by the statutes giving \n20  the President the extraordinary powers to use in the case of a national emergency.”  Id. at 4. \n21  In other words, Congress declined to define what constitutes a “national emergency” in the \n22  National Emergencies Act because it intended for the underlying statutes that provide emergency \n23  authority – statutes like section 2808(a) – to limit the circumstances and manner in which such \n24  authority could be exercised.  See, e.g., supra pp. 15, 17.  If courts refuse to enforce the limitations \n25 \n                                                           \n55 See Feb. 15 Rose Garden Remarks, http://tinyurl.com/TrumpRoseGardenRemarks. \n26 \n56 See A Guide to Emergency Powers and Their Use, Brennan Ctr.

Comm. on Gov’t Operations, 94th Cong. 7 \n5  (1976) (statement of Sen. Frank Church), or – to use the words of President Trump’s proclamation \n6  – “longstanding” problems that should be addressed through the proper political channels. \n7  Accordingly, as with defendants’ proposed expenditure under section 284, defendants’ \n8  proposed expenditure of up to $3.6 billion under section 2808(a) on the construction of a border \n9  wall is unauthorized and violates the Appropriations Clause. \n10  CONCLUSION \n11    Defendants have evaded the Constitution in their haste to build a wall along the southern \n12  border “with or without Congress.”  The Constitution – not President Trump’s desire to build the \n13  wall “faster” – is the “ultimate expression of the public interest,” Gordon, 721 F.3d at 653 \n14  (quotation marks omitted), and “all citizens have a stake” in ensuring that defendants do not \n15  irrevocably offend that document during the period required to litigate this case, Hernandez, 872 \n16  F.3d at 996 (quotation marks omitted).  The Court should therefore issue a preliminary injunction \n17  prohibiting  defendants  from  transferring  and  spending  funds  in  excess  of  what  Congress \n18  appropriated for counter-narcotics support under 10 U.S.C. § 284 and from spending funds under \n19  10 U.S.C. § 2808(a) on the construction of a wall along the southern border. \n \n20   \n   \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n  17   \nBRIEF OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AS AMICUS CURIAE (4:19-cv-00892-HSG) \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 47   Filed 04/15/19   Page 22 of 23\n \n1  Respectfully submitted, \n \n2  /s/ Douglas N.

Specifically, the panel held that\nSierra Club’s thousands of members live near and frequently\nvisit  areas  along  the  U.S.-Mexico  border  for  hiking,\nbirdwatching, photography, and other professional, scientific,\nrecreational, and aesthetic activities; and construction of a\nborder wall and related infrastructure will acutely injure these\n* This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court.

Additionally, \nthe interests of Sierra Club’s members in the lawsuit are\ngermane to the organization’s purpose.  Similarly, the panel\nheld that the Southern Border Communities Coalition alleged\nfacts that support that it had standing to sue on behalf of itself\nand its member organizations.  The panel further held that\nSierra Club’s injuries were fairly traceable to the Section\n8005 transfers.  In addition, the panel held that the injury to\nSierra Club members and Southern Border Communities\nCoalition was likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial\ndecision. \nIn companion appeal State of California v. Trump, Nos.\n19-16299 and 19-16336, slip op. (9th Cir. June 26, 2020)\n(published concurrently), the panel held that Section 8005 did\nnot authorize the transfers of funds at issue here.  The panel\nreaffirmed this holding here.\nThe  panel  held  that  the  Executive  Branch  lacked\nindependent constitutional authority to authorize the transfer\nof funds.  The panel noted that the Appropriations Clause of\nthe U.S. Constitution exclusively grants the power of the\npurse to Congress.  The panel held that the transfer of funds\nviolated  the  Appropriations  Clause,  and,  therefore,  was\nunlawful.   \nThe panel held that the Sierra Club was a proper party to\nchallenge the Section 8005 transfers, and concluded that\nSierra Club had both a constitutional and an ultra vires cause\nof action.  First, the panel held that where plaintiffs, like\nSierra Club, establish that they satisfy the requirements of\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  44  ooff  8822\n4 SIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP\nArticle III standing, they may invoke separation of powers\nconstraints,  like  the  Appropriations  Clause,  to  challenge\nagency spending in excess of its delegated authority.  Because\nthe federal defendants not only exceeded their delegated\nauthority,  but  also  violated  an  express  constitutional\nprohibition designed to protect individual liberties, the panel\nheld that Sierra Club had a constitutional cause of action.\nSecond, the panel held that the Sierra Club had an equitable\nultra vires cause of action to challenge the Department of\nDefense’s transfer of funds.  Where it is alleged that the\nDepartment of Defense has exceeded the statutory authority\ndelegated by Section 8005, plaintiffs like Sierra Club can\nchallenge this agency action.\nThe panel rejected the federal defendants’ additional\narguments. First, the federal defendants asserted that Sierra\nClub’s challenge must be construed as an Administrative\nProcedure Act (“APA”) claim, rather than as a constitutional\nor ultra vivres cause of action.  The panel held that the APA\nis not to be construed as an exclusive remedy, and the APA\ndoes not displace all constitutional and equitable causes of\naction.  Second, the federal defendants asserted that the zone\nof interests test must apply to any challenge brought by\nSierra Club, and that Section 8005 prescribes the relevant\nzone of interests.  The panel held that Sierra Club fell within\nthe  Appropriations  Clause’s  zone  of  interests.    The\nunconstitutional  transfer  of  funds  here  infringed  upon\nSierra  Club’s  members’  liberty  interests,  harming  their\nenvironmental, aesthetic, and recreational interests.  The\npanel concluded that the Sierra Club had a cause of action to\nchallenge the transfers.\nFinally, the panel held that the district court did not abuse\nits discretion in granting Sierra Club a permanent injunction\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  55  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V.

First, the panel agreed with the district court that Sierra\nClub would suffer irreparable harm to its recreational and\naesthetic  interests  absent  injunction.    Second,  the  panel\nagreed with the district court that the balance of equities and\nthe public interest favored injunctive relief.  The panel held\nthat the Supreme Court’s decision in Winter v. NRDC, Inc.,\n555 U.S. 7 (2008), did not require the panel to vacate the\ninjunction.  \nJudge Collins dissented.  He agreed that at least the Sierra\nClub established Article III standing, but in his view the\norganizations lacked any cause of action to challenge the\ntransfers.  Even assuming that they had a cause of action\nJudge Collins would conclude that the transfers were lawful. \nAccordingly, he would reverse the district court’s partial\nsummary judgment for the organizations and remand for an\nentry of partial summary judgment in favor of the defendants.\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  66  ooff  8822\n6 SIERRA CLUB V.

TRUMP 9\nOPINION\nTHOMAS, Chief Judge:\nWe consider in this appeal challenges by the Sierra Club\nand the Southern Border Communities Coalition (“SBCC”)1\nto the Department of Defense’s budgetary transfers to fund\nconstruction of the wall on the southern border of the United\nStates in California, New Mexico, and Arizona.  Specifically,\nwe consider whether Section 8005 and Section 9002 of the\nDepartment of Defense Appropriations Act of 2019, Pub. L.\nNo.  115-245,  132  Stat.  2981  (2018)  (“Section  8005”)2\nauthorized the budgetary transfers.  In a companion appeal,\nState of California, et al. v. Trump et al., Nos. 19-16299 and\n19-16336,  we  considered  similar  challenges  filed  by  a\ncollective group of States.  However, because Sierra Club\nasserts different legal theories, and this case, when presented,\nwas in a different procedural posture, we treat this appeal\nseparately.    We  conclude  that  the    transfers  were  not\nauthorized, and that plaintiffs have a cause of action.  We\naffirm the judgment of the district court.\n1 We refer throughout this opinion to Sierra Club and SBCC together\nas “Sierra Club,” unless otherwise noted.\n2 For simplicity, because the transfer authorities are both subject to\nSection 8005’s substantive requirements, this opinion refers to these\nauthorities collectively as Section 8005, as did the district court and the\nmotions panel.  Our holding in this case therefore extends to both the\ntransfer of funds pursuant to Section 8005 and Section 9002.\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  1100  ooff  8822\n10 SIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP\nI\nWe  recounted  the  essential  underlying  facts  in  the\ncompanion case.  However, we briefly outline them here for\nconvenience of reference.\nThe President has long supported the construction of a\nborder wall on the southern border between the United States\nand  Mexico.    Since  the  President  took  office  in  2017,\nhowever, Congress has repeatedly declined to provide the\namount of funding requested by the President.\nThe debate over border wall funding came to a head in\nDecember  of  2018.    During  negotiations  to  pass  an\nappropriations bill for the remainder of the fiscal year, the\nPresident announced that he would not sign any legislation\nthat  did  not  allocate  substantial  funds  to  border  wall\nconstruction.  On January 6, 2019, the White House requested\n$5.7  billion  to  fund  the  construction  of  approximately\n234 miles of new physical barrier.3  Budget negotiations\nconcerning  border  wall  funding  reached  an  impasse,\ntriggering the longest partial government shutdown in United\nStates history.\nAfter 35 days, the government shutdown ended without\nan agreement to provide increased border wall funding in the\namount requested by the President.  On February 14, 2019,\nCongress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of\n2019 (“CAA”), which included the Department of Homeland\nSecurity Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2019, Pub. L.\n3 Some form of a physical barrier already exists at the site of some of\nthe construction projects.  In those places, construction would reinforce or\nrebuild the existing portions.\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  1111  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP 11\nNo.  116-6,  div.  A,  133  Stat.  13  (2019).    The  CAA\nappropriated only $1.375 billion for border wall construction,\nspecifying that the funding was for “the construction of\nprimary pedestrian fencing . . . in the Rio Grande Valley\nSector.”  Id. § 230(a)(1).  The President signed the CAA into\nlaw the following day.\nThe President concurrently issued a proclamation under\nthe National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. §§ 1601–1651,\n“declar[ing] that a national emergency exists at the southern\nborder  of  the  United  States.”    Proclamation  No.  9,844,\n84 Fed. Reg. 4949 (Feb. 15, 2019).4  An accompanying White\nHouse Fact Sheet explained that the President was “using his\nlegal authority to take Executive action to secure additional\nresources” to build a border wall, and it specified that “the\nAdministration [had] so far identified up to $8.1 billion that\n[would] be available to build the border wall once a national\nemergency  [was]  declared  and  additional  funds  [were]\nreprogrammed.”  The Fact Sheet identified several funding\nsources, including $2.5 billion of Department of Defense\n(“DoD”) funds that could be transferred to provide support\nfor  counterdrug  activities  of  other  federal  government\nagencies under 10 U.S.C. § 284 (“Section 284”).5  Executive\n4 Subsequently, Congress adopted two joint resolutions terminating\nthe President’s emergency declaration pursuant to its authority under 50\nU.S.C. § 1622(a)(1).  The President vetoed each resolution, and Congress\nfailed to override these vetoes.\n5 Section 284 authorizes the Secretary of Defense to “provide support\nfor the counterdrug activities . . . of any other department or agency of the\nFederal Government” if it receives a request from “the official who has\nresponsibility for the counterdrug activities.” 10 U.S.C.  §§ 284(a),\n284(a)(1)(A).  The statute permits, among other things, support for\n“[c]onstruction of roads and fences and installation of lighting to block\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  1122  ooff  8822\n12 SIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP\nBranch agencies began using the funds identified by the Fact\nSheet to fund border wall construction.  On February 25, the\nDepartment of Homeland Security (“DHS”) submitted to\nDoD a request for Section 284 assistance to block drug\nsmuggling corridors.  In particular, it requested that DoD\nfund “approximately 218 miles” of wall using this authority,\ncomprised of numerous projects.  On March 25, Acting\nSecretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan approved three border\nwall construction projects: Yuma Sector Projects 1 and 2 in\nArizona and El Paso Sector Project 1 in New Mexico.  On\nMay  9,  Shanahan  approved  four  more  border  wall\nconstruction projects: El Centro Sector Project 1 in California\nand Tucson Sector Projects 1–3 in Arizona.\nAt the time Shanahan authorized Section 284 support for\nthese border wall construction projects, the counter-narcotics\nsupport account contained only $238,306,000 in unobligated\nfunds, or less than one tenth of the $2.5 billion needed to\ncomplete those projects.  To provide the support requested,\nShanahan invoked the budgetary transfer authority found in\nSection 8005 of the 2019 DoD Appropriations Act to transfer\nfunds  from  other  DoD  appropriations  accounts  into  the\nSection 284 Drug Interdiction and Counter-Drug Activities-\nDefense appropriations account.\nFor  the  first  set  of  projects,  Shanahan  transferred\n$1 billion from Army personnel funds.  For the second set of\nprojects, Shanahan transferred $1.5 billion from “various\nexcess appropriations,” which contained funds originally\ndrug smuggling corridors across international boundaries of the United\nStates.” Id. § 284(b)(7).  DoD’s provision of support for other agencies\npursuant to Section 284 does not require the declaration of a national\nemergency.\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  1133  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP 13\nappropriated for purposes such as modification of in-service\nmissiles and support for U.S. allies in Afghanistan. \nAs authority for the transfers, DoD invoked Section 8005,\nwhich provides, in relevant part that:  \nUpon  determination  by  the  Secretary  of\nDefense that such action is necessary in the\nnational interest, he may, with the approval of\nthe  Office  of  Management  and  Budget,\ntransfer  not  to  exceed  $4,000,000,000  of\nworking capital funds of the Department of\nDefense or funds made available in this Act to\nthe  Department  of  Defense  for  military\nfunctions  (except  military  construction)\nbetween such appropriations or funds or any\nsubdivision thereof, to be merged with and to\nbe available for the same purposes, and for the\nsame time period, as the appropriation or fund\nto which transferred.6\nSection 8005 also explicitly limits when its authority can\nbe invoked: “Provided, That such authority to transfer may\n6 The other authority invoked by the Federal Defendants, Section\n9002 provides that: “Upon the determination of the Secretary of Defense\nthat such action is necessary in the national interest, the Secretary may,\nwith the approval of the Office of Management and Budget, transfer up to\n$2,000,000,000 between the appropriations or funds made available to the\nDepartment of Defense in this title: Provided, That the Secretary shall\nnotify the Congress promptly of each transfer made pursuant to the\nauthority in this section: Provided further, That the authority provided in\nthis section is in addition to any other transfer authority available to the\nDepartment of Defense and is subject to the same terms and conditions as\nthe authority provided in section 8005 of this Act.”\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  1144  ooff  8822\n14 SIERRA CLUB V.

DoD deviated from this practice\nhere—it  did  not  request  congressional  approval  before\nauthorizing the transfer.  Further, the House Committee on\nArmed Services and the House Committee on Appropriations\nboth  wrote  letters  to  DoD  formally  disapproving  of  the\nreprogramming action after the fact.  Moreover, with respect\nto the second transfer, Shanahan expressly directed that the\ntransfer of funds was to occur “without regard to comity-\nbased policies that require prior approval from congressional\ncommittees.”\nIn  the  end,  Section  8005  was  invoked  to  transfer\n$2.5 billion of DoD funds appropriated for other purposes to\nfund border wall construction.\nII\nOn  February  19,  2019,  Sierra  Club  filed  a  lawsuit\nchallenging the Executive Branch’s funding of the border\nwall.7  Sierra Club pled theories of violation of the 2019\n7 California, New Mexico, and fourteen other states had filed a\nlawsuit the previous day challenging the same border wall funding.

The district court\nheld that Sierra Club had standing to assert its Section 8005\nclaims, and granted the preliminary injunction motion.  The\nFederal  Defendants  timely  appealed  the  preliminary\ninjunction  order.    Sierra  Club  subsequently  sought  a\nsupplemental  preliminary  injunction  to  block  additional\nconstruction planned in California’s El Centro Sector and\nArizona’s Tucson Sector.\nSierra  Club  also  filed  a  motion  requesting  partial\nsummary judgment, a declaratory judgment, and a permanent\ninjunction to enjoin the transfer of funds pursuant to Section\n8005 to construct a border wall in Arizona’s Yuma and\nTucson Sectors, California’s El Centro Sector, and New\nMexico’s El Paso Sector.  The Federal Defendants cross-\nmoved for summary judgment and opposed Sierra Club’s\nmotion.  The district court granted Sierra Club’s motion for\npartial  summary  judgment  and  granted  its  request  for  a\ndeclaratory  judgment  and  a  permanent  injunction.

These members visit border\nareas such as the Tijuana Estuary (California), the Otay\nMountain Wilderness (California), the Jacumba Wilderness\nArea (California), the Sonoran Desert (Arizona), Cabeza\nPrieta National Wildlife Refuge (Arizona), and the Chihuahan\nDesert (New Mexico).\nSierra  Club’s  thousands  of  members  live  near  and\nfrequently visit these areas along the U.S.-Mexico border for\nhiking, birdwatching, photography, and other professional,\nscientific, recreational, and aesthetic activities.  They obtain\nrecreational,  professional,  scientific,  educational,  and\naesthetic benefits from their activities in these areas, and from\nthe wildlife dependent upon the habitat in these areas.  The\nconstruction of a border wall and related infrastructure will\nacutely injure these interests because DHS is proceeding with\nborder wall construction without ensuring compliance with\nany federal or state environmental regulations designed to\nprotect these interests.\nSierra  Club  has  adequately  set  forth  facts  and  other\nevidence by declaration, which taken as true, support these\nallegations for the purpose of Article III standing.\nSierra Club members Orson Bevins and Albert Del Val\nhave alleged that they will be injured by construction of\nYuma Project 1.

SBCC  alleged  that  since  the  Federal\nDefendants proposed border wall construction, it has had to\n“mobilize[] its staff and its affiliates to monitor and respond\nto the diversion of funds and the construction caused by and\naccompanying the national emergency declaration.”  These\n“activities have consumed the majority of SBCC staff’s time,\nthereby interfering with SBCC’s core advocacy regarding\nborder  militarization,  Border  Patrol  law-enforcement\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  2222  ooff  8822\n22 SIERRA CLUB V.

Garcia,\n768 F.3d 1009, 1012 (9th Cir. 2014) (quoting Bennett v.\nSpear, 520 U.S. 154, 167 (1997)).  It makes no difference that\nthe border wall construction is the product of other statutory\nprovisions, such as Section 284, in addition to Section 8005. \n“Causation may be found even if there are multiple links in\nthe chain connecting the defendant’s unlawful conduct to the\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  2233  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V.

A judicial order\nprohibiting the Federal Defendants from spending the money\ntransferred pursuant to Section 8005 would stop construction,\nthereby preventing the harm alleged by Plaintiffs.  Thus,\nSierra Club and SBCC have established that their members\nsatisfy the demands of Article III standing to challenge the\nFederal Defendants’ actions.\nIV\nFirst,  we  consider  whether  Section  8005  or  any\nconstitutional provision authorized DoD to transfer the funds\nat issue.

See Sierra Club, 140 S.\nCt. at 1.  We heed the words of the Court, and carefully\nanalyze  Sierra  Club’s  arguments.    Having  done  so,  we\nconclude that Sierra Club has both a constitutional and an\nultra vires cause of action.\nIn reaching this result, we realize that this is a rare case in\nwhich the “judiciary may . . . have to intervene in determining\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  2266  ooff  8822\n26 SIERRA CLUB V.

We hold that it does.\nCertain  provisions  of  the  Constitution  give  rise  to\nequitable causes of action.  Such causes of action are most\nplainly  available  with  respect  to  provisions  conferring\nindividual rights, such as the Establishment Clause or the\nFree Exercise Clause.  See Trump v.

The Court considered “whether a person indicted for\nviolating  a  federal  statute  has  standing  to  challenge  its\nvalidity  on  the  grounds  that,  by  enacting  it,  Congress\nexceeded its powers under the Constitution, thus intruding\nupon the sovereignty and authority of the States.”  564 U.S.\nat 214.  The Court held that “[j]ust as it is appropriate for an\nindividual, in a proper case, to invoke separation-of-powers\nor checks-and-balances constraints, so too may a litigant, in\na proper case, challenge a law as enacted in contravention of\nconstitutional principles of federalism.”  Id. at 223–24.  It\nreasoned  that  the  challenge  was  permissible  because\n“structural principles secured by the separation of powers\nprotect the individual as well,” and “[a]n individual has a\ndirect interest in objecting to laws that upset the constitutional\nbalance . . . when the enforcement of those laws causes injury\nthat is concrete, particular, and redressable.”  Id. at 222.  In\nother  words,  an  individual  who  otherwise  meets  the\nrequirements  of  Article  III  standing  may  challenge\ngovernment  action  that  violates  structural  constitutional\nprovisions intended to protect individual liberties.\nWe have held that the Appropriations Clause contains\nsuch a cause of action.  See McIntosh, 833 F.3d at 1173–74. \nIn McIntosh, defendants moved to enjoin their prosecutions\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  2288  ooff  8822\n28 SIERRA CLUB V.

We held that “[the Appropriations Clause]\nconstitutes a separation-of-powers limitation that Appellants\ncan invoke to challenge their prosecutions.”  Id. at 1175.  The\nopinion reasoned that so long as a litigant satisfies the Article\nIII  standing  requirements,  he  or  she  can  challenge\nAppropriations Clause violations because “[o]nce Congress,\nexercising its delegated powers, has decided the order of\npriorities in a given area, it is for . . . the courts to enforce\nthem when enforcement is sought.”  Id. at 1172 (quoting\nTenn. Valley Auth. v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153, 194 (1978)).  In\nMcIntosh, we also reaffirmed the Supreme Court’s statement\nin  Bond  that  “both  federalism  and  separation-of-powers\nconstraints in the Constitution serve to protect individual\nliberty, and a litigant in a proper case can invoke such\nconstraints ‘[w]hen government acts in excess of its lawful\npowers.’”  Id. at 1174 (quoting Bond, 564 U.S. at 222).12\nThe cause of action available to the plaintiffs in McIntosh\nis available to Sierra Club here.

The McIntosh Court discussed the\navailability of a constitutional cause of action, analogizing to Bond and\nCanning, and stating that “Appellants have standing to invoke separation-\nof-powers provisions of the Constitution to challenge their criminal\nconvictions.”  833 F.3d at 1174.  Because the Court “confront[ed] an issue\ngermane to the eventual resolution of the case,” and “resolve[d] it after\nreasoned consideration in a published opinion,” McIntosh’s constitutional\nholding is “the law of the circuit.”  Cetacean Cmty. v.

Where plaintiffs, like Sierra Club,\nestablish that they satisfy the requirements of Article III\nstanding, they may invoke separation-of-powers constraints,\nlike the Appropriations Clause, to challenge agency spending\nin excess of its delegated authority.\nThe Federal Defendants argue that Dalton v. Specter,\n511 U.S. 462 (1994) forecloses this result.  They assert that\nDalton’s proposition that not “every action by the President,\nor by another executive official, in excess of his statutory\nauthority is ipso facto in violation of the Constitution,” means\nthat when there is a claim that an Executive Branch official\nacted  in  excess  of  his  statutory  authority,  there  is  no\nconstitutional violation.  Id. at 472.  But Dalton does not hold\nthat every action in excess of statutory authority is not a\nconstitutional violation.13  Rather, Dalton suggests that some\n13 Notably, the plaintiffs in Dalton never alleged that the President\nviolated the Constitution and sought review “exclusively under the\n[Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”)].”  Id. at 471.  Only the Court of\nAppeals “sought to determine whether non-APA review, based on either\ncommon law or constitutional principles, was available.”  Id.  The\nSupreme Court did not consider whether the President had violated a\nspecific constitutional prohibition; instead, it took issue only with the\nCourt of Appeals’ contention that “whenever the President acts in excess\nof his statutory authority, he also violates the constitutional separation-of-\npowers doctrine.”  Id.  The Supreme Court’s objection to this conclusion\nis  unsurprising  in  the  context  of  the  Defense  Base  Closure  and\nRealignment Act of 1990 at issue in Dalton.  The Constitution divides\nauthority with respect to the military between Congress and the President. \nHere, in contrast, the Constitution delegates exclusively to Congress the\npower of the purse.\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  3300  ooff  8822\n30 SIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP\nactions in excess of statutory authority may be constitutional\nviolations,  while  others  may  not.    Specifically,  Dalton\nsuggests that a constitutional violation may occur when an\nofficer violates an express prohibition of the Constitution.  Id.\n(citing Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau\nof Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 396–97 (1971) for the distinction\nbetween “actions contrary to [a] constitutional prohibition,”\nand those “merely said to be in excess of the authority\ndelegated . . . by the Congress”).  The Appropriations Clause\ncontains such a constitutional prohibition, declaring that “[n]o\nMoney shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence\nof Appropriations made by Law . . . .”  U.S. Const. art.1, § 9,\ncl. 7.  Under Dalton, then, violations of the Appropriations\nClause may give rise to viable causes of action.\nDalton’s discussion of Youngstown only underscores this\npoint.  The Court determined that Youngstown could not stand\nfor the proposition “that an action taken by the President in\nexcess of his statutory authority necessarily violates the\nConstitution” because in Youngstown “no statutory authority\nwas claimed.”  Dalton, 511 U.S. at 473 (emphasis added). \nThe Court concluded only that “claims simply alleging that\nthe President has exceeded his statutory authority are not\n‘constitutional’ claims, subject to judicial review.”  Id.  Thus,\nDalton and its discussion of Youngstown do not address\nsituations in which the President exceeds his or her statutory\nauthority,  and  in  doing  so,  also  violates  a  specific\nconstitutional prohibition, as is the case here.\nNeither does Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Center, Inc.,\n575 U.S. 320 (2015), require an opposite result here.  In\nArmstrong, the Supreme Court rejected the argument that the\nSupremacy Clause created a private right of action.  Id.\nat  325–27.    But  the  Supremacy  Clause  is  not  the\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  3311  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V.

Cooke ed. 1961)), the\nAppropriations Clause contains an explicit prohibition, which\nprotects individual liberty, because “[a]ny exercise of a power\ngranted by the Constitution to one of the other branches of\nGovernment is limited by a valid reservation of congressional\ncontrol over funds in the Treasury,”  McIntosh, 833 F.3d at\n1175.  “The individual loses liberty in a real sense if [the\nappropriations  power]  is  not  subject  to  traditional\nconstitutional constraints.”  Clinton v. City of New York,\n524 U.S. at 451 (Kennedy, J., concurring).  Thus, while it\nmight be “strange” “to give a clause that makes federal law\nsupreme a reading that limits Congress’s power to enforce\nthat law,” Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 326, it is entirely sensible\nto  give  a  clause  that  restricts  the  power  of  the  federal\ngovernment as a whole a reading that safeguards individual\nliberty.\nTherefore,  because  the  Federal  Defendants  not  only\nexceeded  their  delegated  authority,  but  also  violated  an\nexpress  constitutional  prohibition  designed  to  protect\nindividual  liberties,  we  hold  that  Sierra  Club  has  a\nconstitutional cause of action here.\nB\nSecond, we consider whether Sierra Club has an equitable\nultra  vires  cause  of  action  to  challenge  the  Federal\nDefendants’ transfer.  We hold that it does.\nWhether Sierra Club can assert an equitable ultra vires\ncause of action turns on “whether the relief [it] request[s] . . .\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  3322  ooff  8822\n32 SIERRA CLUB V.

Equitable actions to enjoin ultra\nvires official conduct do not depend upon the availability of\na statutory cause of action; instead, they seek a “judge-made\nremedy”  for  injuries  stemming  from  unauthorized\ngovernment conduct, and they rest on the historic availability\nof equitable review.  Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 327.  “The\nsubstantive prerequisites for obtaining an equitable remedy\n. . . depend on traditional principles of equity jurisdiction.” \nGrupo Mexicano, 527 U.S. at 318–19 (quotations and citation\nomitted).\nThe relief Sierra Club requests has been traditionally\navailable.  “The ability to sue to enjoin unconstitutional\nactions by state and federal officers is the creation of courts\nof equity, and reflects a long history of judicial review of\nillegal  executive  action,  tracing  back  to  England.” \nArmstrong,  575  U.S.  at  327  (citing  Jaffe  &  Henderson,\nJudicial Review and the Rule of Law: Historical Origins,\n72 L.Q. Rev. 345 (1956)); see also Harmon v. Brucker,\n355 U.S. 579, 581–82 (1958) (“Generally, judicial relief is\navailable  to  one  who  has  been  injured  by  an  act  of  a\ngovernment official which is in excess of his express or\nimplied  powers.”).    Such  causes  of  action  have  been\ntraditionally available in American courts: “[w]hen Congress\nlimits its delegation of power, courts infer (unless the statute\nclearly  directs  otherwise)  that  Congress  expects  this\nlimitation to be judicially enforced.”  Dart v. United States,\n848 F.2d 217, 223 (D.C. Cir. 1988).\nThe passage of the APA has not altered this presumption. \n“Prior to the APA’s enactment . . . courts had recognized the\nright of judicial review of agency actions that exceeded\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  3333  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP 33\nauthority,” and “[n]othing in the subsequent enactment of the\nAPA altered [that] doctrine of review,” to “repeal the review\nof ultra vires actions.”  Id. at 224.  “When an executive acts\nultra vires, courts are normally available to reestablish the\nlimits on his authority.”  Id.\nThat Sierra Club has a cause of action to enjoin the\nunconstitutional actions at issue here is best illustrated by\nYoungstown.  There, Congress passed numerous statutes\nauthorizing the President to take personal and real property\nunder specific conditions.  343 U.S. at 585–86.  During the\nKorean War, however, President Truman signed an executive\norder seizing most of the nation’s steel mills, even though the\nconditions of the statutes had not been satisfied as a matter of\nfact.  Id. at 582, 586.  It fell to the Supreme Court to\ndetermine whether the President had constitutional authority\nto seize the steel mills—it held he did not and affirmed the\ndistrict court injunction.  Id. at 588–589.  The Court never\nquestioned that it had the authority to provide the requested\nrelief.\nSuch is the case here.  Section 8005 authorizes DoD to\ntransfer funds under certain conditions; however, as explained\npreviously, DoD failed to satisfy those conditions.  Likewise,\nas  explained  previously,  the  Executive  Branch  lacks\nindependent  constitutional  authority  to  fund  border  wall\nconstruction.  If an equitable ultra vires action was available\nto the plaintiffs in Youngstown, it surely must be available to\nSierra Club here.\nA number of D.C. Circuit cases reaffirm that review is\nordinarily available when an agency exceeds its delegation of\nauthority.  In Chamber of Commerce of the United States v.\nReich, the D.C. Circuit considered whether the Chamber of\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  3344  ooff  8822\n34 SIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP\nCommerce had a cause of action to challenge an executive\norder barring the federal government from contracting with\nemployers who hire permanent replacements during a lawful\nstrike.    74  F.3d  1322,  1325–26  (D.C. Cir.  1996).    The\ngovernment argued that the Chamber of Commerce lacked a\nstatutory  cause of action and that APA review was not\navailable  because  the  challenge  was  directed  at  the\nPresident’s statutory authority to issue the executive order,\nand the President is not an agency within the meaning of the\nAPA.  See id.  The court agreed that APA review was not\navailable, but it held that non-statutory review remained\navailable.  See id. at 1327.  The court held that “[i]f a plaintiff\nis unable to bring his case predicated on either a specific or a\ngeneral statutory review provision, he may still be able to\ninstitute  a non-statutory review action.”  Id.  The court\nreasoned in part that “[t]he responsibility of determining the\nlimits of statutory grants of authority . . . is a judicial function\nentrusted  to  the  courts  by  Congress  by  the  statutes\nestablishing  courts  and  marking  their  jurisdiction.”    Id.\n(quoting Stark v. Wickard, 321 U.S. 288, 310 (1944)).\nLikewise, in Dart v. United States, the D.C. Circuit\nconsidered whether the plaintiff could challenge the Secretary\nof Commerce’s decision to impose civil sanctions for a\nviolation of the Export Administration Act (“EAA”).  See\n848 F.2d at 219.  The court held that even though the EAA\nexpressly limited judicial review, the court retained the ability\nto  review  whether  the  Secretary  exceeded  the  authority\ndelegated by the statute.  See id. at 223–34.  It explained that\n“the presumption of judicial review is particularly strong\nwhere  an  agency  is  alleged  to  have  acted  beyond  its\nauthority.”  Id. at 223.  It ultimately concluded that the\nSecretary had done just that and invalidated the sanctions he\nimposed.\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  3355  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP 35\nThese cases support our holding here that Sierra Club has\nan equitable ultra vires cause of action to challenge DoD’s\ntransfer of funds.  Where it is alleged that DoD has exceeded\nthe statutory authority delegated by Section 8005, plaintiffs\nlike Sierra Club can challenge this agency action.\nThe Federal Defendants contend that an equitable cause\nof  action  is  not  available  to  Sierra  Club  here  because\nequitable remedies are available only when they have been\n“traditionally  available  in  the  specific  circumstances\npresented,” and that the remedies sought here have not been\ntraditionally available in the specific circumstances presented\nby this case.\nThe Federal Defendants cite Grupo Mexicano in support\nof this argument, but that case provides little support for their\nposition.  In Grupo Mexicano, the Court considered whether\na  district  court  had  the  power  to  issue  a  preliminary\ninjunction to prevent the transfer of assets in which no lien or\nequitable interest was claimed.  See 527 U.S. at 318.  The\nCourt concluded it did not.  See id. at 333.  It held that a\ndistrict  court  cannot  grant  relief  that  “has  never  been\navailable before—and especially (as here) a type of relief that\nhas been specifically disclaimed by longstanding judicial\nprecedent,” particularly when “there is absolutely nothing\nnew about debtors’ trying to avoid paying their debts, or\nseeking to favor some creditors over others.”  Id. at 322; see\nid. at 333.\nHere, however, the plaintiffs request a type of relief that\nis consistent with our longstanding precedent.  Indeed, as\nexplained above, the Supreme Court has actually granted\ninjunctive relief in circumstances very similar to these.  See,\ne.g., Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 589.  Further, unlike attempts\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  3366  ooff  8822\n36 SIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP\nto avoid paying debts, instances of Executive Branch ultra\nvires action are, fortunately, relatively rare, and unlikely to\noccur in contexts likely to repeat themselves precisely.  Thus,\nthe  justifications  for  limiting  equitable  relief  in  Grupo\nMexicano are not present here, and courts are able to grant the\nrelief sought by Sierra Club.\nWe  therefore  hold  that  Sierra  Club  may  assert  an\nequitable ultra vires cause of action to challenge DoD’s\ntransfer of funds.\nC\nThe Federal Defendants raise a number of additional\narguments.  We address them here.\nFirst, the Federal Defendants assert that Sierra Club’s\nchallenge must be construed as an APA claim, rather than as\na constitutional or ultra vires cause of action.  But neither of\nthe two cases cited by the Federal Defendants compel this\nconclusion.  The Federal Defendants cite Hoefler v. Babbitt,\n139 F.3d 726, 728 (9th Cir. 1998) for the proposition that\n“[t]he APA is the sole means for challenging the legality of\nfederal agency action,” but there, we did not consider whether\nplaintiffs had a constitutional or ultra vires cause of action;\nrather,  we  considered  whether  the  action  was  properly\nconsidered under the APA or the Quiet Title Act.  See id.\nat  728–29.    We  ultimately  held  that  the  former  was\nappropriate.  See id. at 729.  To extrapolate from a general\nstatement made in this context, as the Federal Defendants do\nhere, goes too far.\nLikewise, in Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 175 (1997),\nthe  Court  did  not  consider  whether  plaintiffs  had  a\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  3377  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP 37\nconstitutional cause of action; rather, the Court considered\nwhether the citizen-suit provision of the Endangered Species\nAct (“ESA”) provided an exclusive statutory remedy, or\nwhether a cause of action was also available under the APA. \nThe Court ultimately determined that “[n]othing in the ESA’s\ncitizen-suit provision expressly precludes review under the\nAPA, nor do we detect anything in the statutory scheme\nsuggesting a purpose to do so.”  Id.  If anything, this case\nunderscores  that  the  APA  is  not  to  be  construed  as  an\nexclusive remedy.  Thus, the APA does not displace all\nconstitutional and equitable causes of action.\nSecond, the Federal Defendants assert that the zone of\ninterests test must apply to any challenge brought by Sierra\nClub, and that Section 8005 prescribes the relevant zone of\ninterests.  We reject this argument.\nThe zone of interests test limits which plaintiffs can\ninvoke statutorily created causes of action.  Although earlier\ncases,  such  as  Association  of  Data  Processing  Services\nOrganizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150 (1970), suggested\nthat the test applied to constitutional causes of action, the\nSupreme Court’s most recent zone of interests case, Lexmark\nInternational,  Inc.  v.  Static  Control  Components,  Inc.,\n572 U.S. 118 (2014), clarifies that the test applies only to\nstatutory causes of action and causes of action under the\nAPA.  See id. at 129 (“[T]he modern ‘zone of interests’\nformulation originated . . . as a limitation on the cause of\naction for judicial review conferred by the [APA],” but “[w]e\nhave  since  made  clear,  however,  that  it  applies  to  all\nstatutorily created causes of action.” (emphasis added)).\nCommon sense supports this approach.  As Judge Bork\nexplained in Haitian Refugee Center v. Gracey,\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  3388  ooff  8822\n38 SIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP\nAppellants need not, however, show that their\ninterests fall within the zones of interests of\nthe  constitutional  and  statutory  powers\ninvoked by the President in order to establish\ntheir standing to challenge the interdiction\nprogram  as  ultra  vires.  Otherwise,  a\nmeritorious  litigant,  injured  by  ultra  vires\naction, would seldom have standing to sue\nsince the litigant’s interest normally will not\nfall within the zone of interests of the very\nstatutory or constitutional provision that he\nclaims does not authorize action concerning\nthat interest. For example, were a case like\nYoungstown,  to  arise  today,  the  steel  mill\nowners would not be required to show that\ntheir interests fell within the zone of interests\nof the President’s war powers in order to\nestablish  their  standing  to  challenge  the\nseizure of their mills as beyond the scope of\nthose powers.\n809 F.2d 794, 811 n.14 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (emphasis added). \nWe agree with Judge Bork.14  It would make little sense to\n14 While the dissent asserts that we rely on the wrong portion of Judge\nBork’s opinion, we disagree.  Section 8005 cannot merely be read as a\nstatutory  provision  limiting  the  authority  conferred  when  it  is\nsimultaneously a statutory power invoked by the President.  In any case,\nas explained below, the relevant limitation here is not the inapplicable\nstatutory power invoked by the Executive—Section 8005—but instead the\nrestriction on unlawful action—the Appropriations Clause.  See also Ctr.\nfor Biodiversity v. Trump, No. 1:19-cv-00408, 2020 WL 1643657 at *25\n(D.D.C.

TRUMP 39\nrequire Sierra Club to demonstrate that it falls within the zone\nof  interests  of  Section  8005.    Congress  may  not  have\ncontemplated the environmental advocacy group when it\nincluded  Section  8005  in  the  defense  budget,  but\nnevertheless, Sierra Club has asserted a legally cognizable\ninjury.  The fact Congress did not have Sierra Club as a\nparticular plaintiff in mind when it authorized Section 8005’s\ntransfer authority does not make its injury less real, nor\nDoD’s action more lawful.\nIf  the  zone  of  interests  test  applies  at  all,  the\nAppropriations Clause of the Constitution defines the zone of\ninterests because it is the “particular provision of law upon\nwhich  [Sierra  Club]  relies”  in  seeking  relief.    Bennett,\n520 U.S. at 175–76.  Section 8005 is relevant only because,\nto the extent it applies, it authorizes executive action that\notherwise would be unconstitutional or ultra vires.  That a\nstatute is relevant does not transform a constitutional claim\ninto a statutory one.  Sierra Club’s cause of action stems from\nthe  Federal  Defendants’  violation  of  the  Appropriations\nClause because it seeks to enforce the limits mandated by the\nclause.\nTo the extent the zone of interests test ever applies to\nconstitutional causes of action, it asks only whether a plaintiff\nis “arguably within the zone of interests to be protected . . . by\nthe . . . constitutional guarantee in question.”  Boston Stock\nExch. v. State Tax Comm’n, 429 U.S. 318, 320 n.3 (1977)\n(quoting Data Processing, 397 U.S. at 153).  This renders the\ntest nearly superfluous: so long as a litigant is asserting an\ninjury in fact to his or her constitutional rights, he has a cause\nof action.  See ERWIN CHEMERINKSY, FEDERAL JURISDICTION\n112 (7th ed. 2016) (citing LAURENCE TRIBE, AMERICAN\nCONSTITUTIONAL LAW 446 (3d ed. 2000)).\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  4400  ooff  8822\n40 SIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP\nApplying that generous formulation of the test here,\nSierra Club falls within the Appropriations Clause’s zone of\ninterests.  Here, Sierra Club is an organization within the\nUnited States that is protected by the Constitution.  The\nAppropriations Clause is a “bulwark of the Constitution’s\nseparation of powers,” U.S. Dep’t. of Navy v. Fed. Labor\nRelations Auth., 665 F.3d 1339, 1347 (D.C. Cir. 2012), and\nthe “separation of powers can serve to safeguard individual\nliberty,” McIntosh, 833 F.3d at 1174 (quoting Noel Canning,\n573 U.S. at 525).  The unconstitutional transfer of funds here\ninfringed  upon  Sierra  Club’s  members’  liberty  interests,\nharming  their  environmental,  aesthetic,  and  recreational\ninterests.  Thus, Sierra Club falls within the Clause’s zone of\ninterests, and Sierra Club has a cause of action to challenge\nthe transfers.\nVI\nFinally, we consider whether the district court abused its\ndiscretion in granting Sierra Club a permanent injunction\nenjoining the Federal Defendants from spending the funds at\nissue.  We hold it did not, and we affirm the district court\ninjunction.\nA  permanent  injunction  is  appropriate  when:  (1)  a\nplaintiff will suffer an irreparable injury absent injunction,\n(2) remedies available at law are inadequate,15 (3) the balance\nof  hardships  between  the  parties  supports  an  equitable\nremedy, and (4) the public interest would not be disserved. \neBay Inc. v. MercExchange, LLC, 547 U.S. 388, 391 (2006). \nWhen the government is a party to the case, the court should\nconsider the balance of hardships and public interests factors\n15 The parties do not contest this factor and so we do not address it.\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  4411  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V.

Although injunctive relief “does\nnot follow from success on the merits as a matter of course,” \nWinter v. NRDC, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 32 (2008), we review a\ndistrict court’s decision to grant a permanent injunction for\nabuse of discretion, see eBay, 547 U.S. at 391.\nThe district court did not abuse its discretion in weighing\nthese  factors  and  determining  that  injunctive  relief  was\nwarranted.  First, we agree with the district court that Sierra\nClub would suffer irreparable harm to its recreational and\naesthetic interests absent injunction.  An organization can\ndemonstrate irreparable harm by showing that the challenged\naction will injure its members’ enjoyment of public lands. \nSee All. for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1135\n(9th Cir. 2011) (finding irreparable harm when the Forest\nService’s  proposed  project  would  harm  the  Alliance’s\nmembers’ ability to “view, experience, and utilize” national\nforest areas in an undisturbed state).  We conclude that Sierra\nClub sufficiently demonstrated that the Federal Defendants’\nproposed use of funds would harm its members ability to\nrecreate and enjoy public lands along the border such that it\nwill suffer irreparable harm absent injunction.\nThe Federal Defendants’ arguments to the contrary are\nunpersuasive.  The Federal Defendants submit that Sierra\nClub will not be irreparably harmed because its members\nhave plenty of other space to enjoy.  We have already rejected\nthe essence of the Federal Defendants’ argument.  See All. for\nthe Wild Rockies, 632 F.3d at 1135 (concluding that the\nForest  Service’s  argument  that  plaintiffs  can  “view,\nexperience, and utilize other areas of the forest” “proves too\nmuch,” because its logical extension is that a “plaintiff can\nnever suffer irreparable injury resulting from environmental\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  4422  ooff  8822\n42 SIERRA CLUB V.

By passing the CAA, Congress made a calculated\nchoice to fund only one segment of border barrier.  The\npublic interest favors enforcing this decision.  In contrast, the\nFederal Defendants cannot suffer harm “from an injunction\nthat  merely  ends  an  unlawful  practice.”    Rodriguez  v.\nRobbins, 715 F.3d 1127, 1145 (9th Cir. 2013) (citing Zepeda\nv.

The equitable\nmaxim “he who comes in equity must come with clean\nhands” would be turned on its head if unlawful conduct by\none party precluded a court from granting equitable relief to\nthe opposing party.  The district court properly concluded that\nthe balance of equities and the public interest favor injunctive\nrelief.\nThe Federal Defendants’ additional arguments do not\ncompel a different result.

Key distinctions between this case and Winter\nrender it inapposite.  There, plaintiffs’ “ultimate legal claim\n[was] that the Navy must prepare an [environmental impact\nstatement], not that it must cease sonar training” because the\nuse of the sonar had otherwise been sanctioned by law.  Id.\nat 32.  Having determined that the “continuation of the\nexercises . . . was ‘essential to national security,’” id. at 18,\nthe President had used his statutory authority to “exempt from\ncompliance those elements of the Federal agency activity that\n[were] found by the Federal court to be inconsistent with an\napproved State program,” 16 U.S.C. § 1456(c)(1)(B).  In\naddition, the Council on Environmental Quality (“CEQ”) had\nauthorized the Navy to implement alternative arrangements\nto NEPA compliance that would allow the Navy to conduct\nits training exercises under mitigation procedures, but it\nimposed  additional  notice,  research,  and  reporting\nrequirements.  Winter, 555 U.S. at 18–19.\nBy contrast, here, Sierra Club’s ultimate legal claim is\nthat  DoD  cannot  legally  use  Section  8005  to  fund\nconstruction of the border wall, and moreover, that no such\nexemption applies.  If anything, Section 8005 itself is a\ndefense  against  the  Executive  Branch’s  unconstitutional\ntransfer of funds; however, as discussed previously, it offers\nno such legal cover here.  Therefore, while the use of the\nsonar was not unlawful at the time the Supreme Court vacated\nthe injunction in Winter, DoD’s transfer of funds here is. \nWhile the injunction here “merely ends an unlawful practice,”\nRodriguez,  715  F.3d  at  1145,  the  injunction  in  Winter\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  4444  ooff  8822\n44 SIERRA CLUB V.

Accordingly, the use of MFA sonar\nduring training missions was deemed “mission-critical,” id.\nat 14, because it is not only the “most effective technology,”\nid.  at  13,  but  “the  only  proven  method  of  identifying\nsubmerged diesel-electric submarines operating on battery\npower,” id. at 14.  On the other side of the equation, “the\nmost serious possible injury [to plaintiffs] would be harm to\nan unknown number of marine mammals.”  Id. at 26.  The\nCourt reasonably concluded that the “balance of equities and\nconsideration of the overall public interest . . . tip strongly in\nfavor of the Navy.”  Id.\nThe balance of interests does not so starkly favor the\nFederal Defendants here.  Although they allege that the\ninjunction “frustrates the government’s ability to stop the\nflow of drugs across the border,” unlike the government in\nWinter, the Federal Defendants have failed to demonstrate\nthat construction of the border wall would serve this purpose,\nor alternatively, that an injunction would inhibit this purpose. \nThe Federal Defendants cite drug trafficking statistics, but\nfail to address how the construction of additional physical\nbarriers  would  further  the  interdiction  of  drugs.    The\nExecutive Branch’s failure to show, in concrete terms, that\nthe  public  interest  favors  a  border  wall  is  particularly\nsignificant given that Congress determined fencing to be a\nlower budgetary priority and the Department of Justice’s own\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  4455  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V.

In  each  case,  a  distinct  group  of\nplaintiffs brought suit challenging the Acting Secretary of\nDefense’s invocation of § 8005 and § 9002 of the Department\nof Defense Appropriations Act, 2019 (“DoD Appropriations\nAct”), Pub. L. No. 115-245, Div. A, 132 Stat. 2981, 2999,\n3042 (2018), to transfer $2.5 billion in funds that Congress\nhad  appropriated  for  other  purposes  into  a  different\nDepartment of Defense (“DoD”) appropriation that could\nthen be used by DoD for construction of border fencing and\naccompanying roads and lighting.  In California v. Trump, the\nrelevant  plaintiffs  are  the  States  of  California  and  New\nMexico, who challenged two such construction projects, and\nhere the plaintiffs are the Sierra Club and the Southern Border\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  4477  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V.

The district\ncourt granted declaratory relief to both sets of plaintiffs\ninvalidating the transfers, but it granted permanent injunctive\nrelief only to the Organizations.  The majority concludes that\nthe Organizations have Article III standing; that they have a\ncause  of  action  to  challenge  the  transfers  under  the\nAppropriations Clause of the Constitution as well as a cause\nof action under an equitable  ultra vires theory; that the\ntransfers were unlawful; and that the district court properly\ndetermined that the Organizations are entitled to declaratory\nand injunctive relief.  I agree that at least the Sierra Club has\nestablished  Article  III  standing,  but  in  my  view  the\nOrganizations lack any cause of action to challenge the\ntransfers.  And even assuming that they had a cause of action,\nI conclude that the transfers were lawful.  Accordingly, I\nwould reverse the district court’s partial judgment for the\nOrganizations  and  remand  for  entry  of  partial  summary\njudgment in favor of the Defendants.  I respectfully dissent.1\n1 There is considerable overlap between the substantive issues\npresented in this case and in California v. Trump, and my disagreements\nwith the majority in this case largely parallel my disagreements in the\nother case.  But rather than simply cross-reference all of the discussion in\nmy dissent in California v. Trump, I will follow the majority and will rely\non cross-reference only when it does.  The result is a fair amount of\nverbatim repetition between this dissent and my dissent in California v.\nTrump, but proceeding in this way avoids the awkwardness of directing\nthe reader to a separate published opinion when that reader wants to see\nwhat my response is to a particular point made by the majority in its\nopinion in this case.\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  4488  ooff  8822\n48 SIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP\nI\nThe parties’ dispute over DoD’s funding transfers comes\nto us against the backdrop of a complex statutory framework\nand  an  equally  complicated  procedural  history.    Before\nturning  to  the  merits,  I  will  briefly  review  both  that\nframework and that history.\nA\nUpon  request  from  another  federal  department,  the\nSecretary of Defense is authorized to “provide support for the\ncounterdrug activities” of that department by undertaking the\n“[c]onstruction  of  roads  and  fences  and  installation  of\nlighting  to  block  drug  smuggling  corridors  across\ninternational boundaries of the United States.”  10 U.S.C.\n§ 284(a), (b)(7).  On February 25, 2019, the Department of\nHomeland Security (“DHS”) made a formal request to DoD\nfor such assistance.  Noting that its counterdrug activities\nincluded the construction of border infrastructure, see Illegal\nImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of\n1996 (“IIRIRA”), Pub. L. No. 104-208, Div. C, § 102(a),\n110 Stat. 3009-546, 3009-554 (1996) (codified as amended as\na note to 8 U.S.C. § 1103), DHS requested that “DoD,\npursuant to its authority under 10 U.S.C. § 284(b)(7), assist\nwith the construction of fences[,] roads, and lighting” in\nseveral specified “Project Areas” in order “to block drug-\nsmuggling  corridors  across  the  international  boundary\nbetween the United States and Mexico.”\nOn  March  25,  2019,  the  Acting  Defense  Secretary\ninvoked § 284 and approved the provision of support for\nDHS’s “El Paso Sector Project 1” (which would involve DoD\nconstruction of border fencing, roads, and lighting in Luna\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  4499  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP 49\nand Doña Ana Counties in New Mexico), as well as for, inter\nalia, DHS’s “Yuma Sector Project 1” (which would involve\nDoD construction of similar border infrastructure in Yuma\nCounty, Arizona).  Thereafter, the Secretary of Homeland\nSecurity invoked his authority under § 102(c) of IIRIRA to\nwaive a variety of federal environmental statutes with respect\nto the planned construction of border infrastructure in the\nrelevant portions of the El Paso Sector and the Yuma Sector,\nas well as “all . . . state . . . laws, regulations, and legal\nrequirements of, deriving from, or related to the subject of,”\nthose federal laws.  See 84 Fed. Reg. 17185, 17187 (Apr. 24,\n2019); 84 Fed. Reg. 17187, 17188 (Apr. 24, 2019).\nSubsequently,  on  May  9,  2019,  the  Acting  Defense\nSecretary again invoked § 284, this time to approve DoD’s\nconstruction of similar border infrastructure to support DHS’s\n“El Centro Sector Project 1” in Imperial County, California,\nand DHS’s “Tucson Sector Projects 1, 2, and 3” in Pima and\nCochise Counties in Arizona.  Less than a week later, the\nSecretary of Homeland Security again invoked his authority\nunder  IIRIRA  §  102(c)  to  waive  federal  and  state\nenvironmental laws, this time with respect to the construction\nin the relevant sections of the El Centro Sector and the\nTucson Sector.  See 84 Fed. Reg. 21800, 21801 (May 15,\n2019); 84 Fed. Reg. 21798, 21799 (May 15, 2019).\nAlthough § 284 authorized the Acting Defense Secretary\nto provide this support, there were insufficient funds in the\nrelevant DoD appropriation to do so.  Specifically, for Fiscal\nYear 2019, Congress had appropriated for “Drug Interdiction\nand  Counter-Drug  Activities,  Defense”  a  total  of  only\n$670,271,000 that could be used for counter-drug support. \nSee DoD Appropriations Act, Title VI, 132 Stat. at 2997\n(appropriating, under Title governing “Other Department of\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  5500  ooff  8822\n50 SIERRA CLUB V.

That  transfer  was\naccomplished by moving $993,627,000 from the “Military\nPersonnel, Army” appropriation and $6,373,000 from the\n“Reserve Personnel, Army” appropriation.\nTo support the El Centro Sector Project 1 and Tucson\nSector Projects 1, 2, and 3, the Acting Secretary on May 9,\n2019  again  invoked  his  transfer  authority  to  move  an\nadditional  $1.5  billion  into  the  “Drug  Interdiction  and\nCounter-Drug Activities, Defense” appropriation.  Pursuant\nto § 8005 of the DoD Appropriations Act, DoD transferred a\ntotal of $818,465,000 from 12 different DoD appropriations\ninto the “Drug Interdiction and Counter-Drug Activities,\nDefense” appropriation.  Invoking the Secretary’s distinct but\ncomparable  authority  under  §  9002  to  transfer  funds\nappropriated under the separate Title governing “Overseas\nContingency  Operations,”  DoD transferred  $604,000,000\nfrom the “Afghanistan Security Forces Fund” appropriation\nand  $77,535,000  from  the  “Operation  and  Maintenance,\nDefense-Wide” appropriation into the “Drug Interdiction and\nCounter-Drug Activities, Defense” appropriation.\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  5511  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP 51\nB\nThe complex procedural context of this case involves two\nparallel lawsuits and four appeals to this court, and it has\nalready produced one published Ninth Circuit opinion that\nwas promptly displaced by the Supreme Court.\n1\nThe Organizations filed this action in the district court\nagainst the Acting Defense Secretary, DoD, and a variety of\nother federal officers and agencies.  In their March 18, 2019\nFirst Amended Complaint, they sought to challenge, inter\nalia, any transfer of funds by the Acting Secretary under\n§ 8005 or § 9002.  California and New Mexico, joined by\nseveral other States, filed a similar action, and their March\n13, 2019 First Amended Complaint also sought to challenge\nany  such  transfers.    Both  sets  of  plaintiffs  moved  for\npreliminary injunctions in early April 2019.  The portion of\nthe States’ motion that was directed at the § 8005 transfers\nwas asserted only on behalf of New Mexico and only with\nrespect to the construction on New Mexico’s border (i.e., El\nPaso Sector Project 1).  The Organizations’ motion was\nlikewise directed at El Paso Sector Project 1, but it also\nchallenged Yuma Sector Projects 1 and one other project\n(“Yuma Sector Project 2”).\nAfter concluding that the Organizations were likely to\nprevail on their claims that the transfers under § 8005 were\nunlawful  and  that  these  organizational  plaintiffs  had\ndemonstrated  a  “likelihood  of  irreparable  harm  to  their\nmembers’ aesthetic and recreational interests,” the district\ncourt on May 24, 2019 granted a preliminary injunction\nenjoining Defendants from using transferred funds for “Yuma\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  5522  ooff  8822\n52 SIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP\nSector  Project  1  and  El  Paso  Sector  Project  1.”2    In  a\ncompanion  order,  however,  the  district  court  denied\npreliminary injunctive relief to the States.  Although the court\nheld that New Mexico was likely to succeed on its claim that\nthe transfers under § 8005 were unlawful, the court concluded\nthat, in light of the grant of a preliminary injunction against\nEl Paso Sector Project 1 to the Organizations, New Mexico\nwould not suffer irreparable harm from the denial of its\nduplicative  request  for  such  relief.    On  May  29,  2019,\nDefendants appealed the preliminary injunction in favor of\nthe Organizations, and after the district court refused to stay\nthat  injunction,  Defendants  moved  in  this  court  for  an\nemergency stay on June 3, 2019.  New Mexico did not appeal\nthe district court’s denial of its duplicative request for a\npreliminary injunction.\n2\nWhile the Defendants’ emergency stay request was being\nbriefed and considered in this court, the Organizations moved\nfor partial summary judgment on June 12, 2019.  The motion\nwas limited to the issue of whether the transfers under § 8005\nand § 9002 were lawful, and it requested corresponding\ndeclaratory relief, as well as a permanent injunction against\nthe use of transferred funds for all six projects (El Paso Sector\nProject 1, El Centro Sector Project 1, Yuma Sector Project 1,\nand Tucson Sector Projects 1, 2, and 3).  California and New\nMexico (but not the other States) filed a comparable summary\njudgment motion that same day, directed only at El Paso\n2 By the time the district court ruled, DoD had decided not to use\nfunds transferred under § 8005 for any construction in Yuma Sector\nProject 2, and so the request for a preliminary injunction as to that project\nwas moot.\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  5533  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V.

Defendants\nfiled cross-motions for summary judgment on the legality of\nthe transfers under § 8005 and § 9002 with respect to the\ncorresponding projects at issue in each case.\nOn  June  28,  2019,  the  district  court  granted  partial\nsummary judgment and declaratory relief to both sets of\nplaintiffs, concluding that the transfers under § 8005 and\n§  9002  were  unlawful.    The  court  granted  permanent\ninjunctive relief to the Organizations against all six projects,\nbut it denied any such relief to California and New Mexico. \nThe district court concluded that California and New Mexico\nhad  failed  to  prove  a  threat  of  future  demonstrable\nenvironmental harm.  The court expressed doubts about the\nStates’ alternative theory that they had demonstrated injury to\ntheir sovereign interests, but the court ultimately concluded\nthat it did not need to resolve that issue.  As before, the\ndistrict court instead held that California and New Mexico\nwould  not  suffer  any  irreparable  harm  in  light  of  the\nduplicative relief granted to the Organizations.  The district\ncourt  denied  Defendants’  cross-motions  for  summary\njudgment in both cases.  Invoking its authority under Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 54(b), the district court entered\npartial judgments in favor of, respectively, the Sierra Club\nand SBCC, and California and New Mexico.  The district\ncourt  denied  Defendants’  request  to  stay  the  permanent\ninjunction pending appeal.\n3\nOn June 29, 2019, Defendants timely appealed in both\ncases and asked this court to stay the permanent injunction\nbased on the same briefing and argument that had been\npresented in the preliminary injunction appeal.

See Sierra Club v.

Defenders), 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992). \nThus, although well-pleaded allegations are enough at the\nmotion-to-dismiss stage, they are insufficient to establish\nstanding at the summary-judgment stage.

The Sierra Club has presented\nsufficient evidence as to each of these three requirements.\nTo establish that its members would suffer irreparable\nharm  absent  a  permanent  injunction,  the  Sierra  Club\npresented declarations from members who regularly visit the\nrespective project areas.  These members described how the\nconstruction and the resulting border barriers would interfere\nwith their enjoyment of the surrounding landscape and would\nimpede their ability to fish, to hunt, to monitor and document\nwildlife and vegetation for educational purposes, and to\nparticipate in other activities near the project sites.  These\ninjuries  to  the  members’  recreational,  aesthetic,  and\nenvironmental interests are sufficient to constitute an injury-\nin-fact for Article III purposes.  See Lujan v. Defenders,\n504 U.S. at 562–63 (“Of course, the desire to use or observe\nan  animal  species,  even  for  purely  esthetic  purposes,  is\nundeniably a cognizable interest for purpose of standing.”). \nMoreover,  these  injuries  are  fairly  traceable  to  the\nconstruction, and an injunction blocking the transfers would\nredress  those  injuries  by  effectively  stopping  that\n4 The district court explicitly addressed Article III standing only in\nconnection with the preliminary injunction motion.  Although Article III\nstanding was not revisited when the Organizations subsequently moved\nfor summary judgment and a permanent injunction, the Organizations’\nshowing of injury in support of a permanent injunction provides a\nsufficient basis for evaluating their Article III standing.\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  5577  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V.

This evidence is therefore\nsufficient to establish that these members would have Article\nIII standing to sue in their own right.\nThe other Hunt requirements are also satisfied.  These\nmembers’ interests are clearly germane to the Sierra Club’s\nmission to protect the natural environment and local wildlife\nand plant life.  And in seeking declaratory and injunctive\nrelief,  the  lawsuit  does  not  require  the  participation  of\nindividual members.  See Hunt, 432 U.S. at 343.\nBecause the Sierra Club satisfies the applicable standing\nrequirements as to all of the challenged projects, we may\nproceed to the merits without having to address SBCC’s\nstanding.  See Secretary of the Interior v. California, 464 U.S.\n312, 319 n.3 (1984) (“Since the State of California clearly\ndoes have standing, we need not address the standing of the\nother [plaintiffs], whose position here is identical to the\nState’s.”).  And given my view that the Organizations’ legal\nchallenges fail, I perceive no obstacle to entering judgment\nagainst both the Sierra Club and SBCC without determining\nwhether the latter has standing.  See Steel Co. v. Citizens for\na Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 98 (1998).\nIII\nAfter  examining  the  Article  III  standing  of  the\nOrganizations, the majority then proceeds straight to the\nmerits of whether the transfers were unlawful.  See Maj.\nOpin. at 23.  But we ought not address that issue unless we\nhave first determined that the Organizations have asserted a\nviable cause of action that properly brings that issue before\nus.

See Maj. Opin. at 25.  I\ndisagree with that conclusion, and I also disagree with the\nOrganizations’ alternative argument that they have a valid\ncause of action under the Administrative Procedure Act\n(“APA”).  See Trump v. Sierra Club, 140 S. Ct. at 1 (“[T]he\nGovernment has made a sufficient showing at this stage that\nthe plaintiffs have no cause of action to obtain review of the\nActing Secretary’s compliance with Section 8005.”).5\n5 In its merits analysis, the majority scarcely cites the motions panel’s\npublished decision, which addressed the Organizations’ likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits of many of the same issues before us.  I agree with\nthe majority’s implicit rejection of the Organizations’ contention that the\nmotions panel’s opinion bars this merits panel from examining these\nissues afresh.  Although the motions panel decision is a precedent, it\nremains subject to reconsideration by this court until we issue our\nmandate.  See United States v. Houser, 804 F.2d 565, 567–68 (9th Cir.\n1986) (distinguishing, on this point, between reconsideration of a prior\npanel’s decision “during the course of a single appeal” and a decision “on\na prior appeal”); cf. Gonzalez v. Arizona, 677 F.3d 383, 389 n.4 (9th Cir.\n2012) (en banc) (three-judge panel lacks authority to overrule a decision\nin a prior appeal in the same case).  To the extent that Lair v. Bullock, 798\nF.3d 736, 747 (9th Cir. 2015), suggests otherwise, that suggestion is dicta\nand directly contrary to our decision in Houser.  See East Bay Sanctuary\nCovenant v. Trump, 950 F.3d 1242, 1261–65 (9th Cir. 2020).  In all\nevents, the precedential force of the motions panel’s opinion was largely,\nif not entirely, vitiated by the Supreme Court’s subsequent decision to\ngrant the very stay that the motions panel’s opinion denied.  I do not\nagree, however, with the majority’s disregard of the Supreme Court’s\norder in this case—a disregard that hardly befits the “wary and humble”\nattitude the majority professes.  See Maj. Opin. at 25–26.\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  5599  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP 59\nA\nAlthough the Organizations invoke the APA only as a\nfallback to their preferred non-statutory claims, I think it is\nappropriate to first consider whether they have a statutory\ncause of action under the APA.  Cf. Chamber of Commerce\nv. Reich, 74 F.3d 1322, 1326–27 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (suggesting\nthat, if a plaintiff relies on both the APA and non-statutory-\nreview claims, the APA claim should be considered first). \nEven assuming arguendo that the APA does not displace\nreliance upon alternative non-statutory causes of action, see\ninfra at 69, the contours of any express cause of action under\nthe  APA  certainly  provide  appropriate  context  for  the\nconsideration of any non-statutory claim.\nIn authorizing suit by any person “adversely affected or\naggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant\nstatute,” 5 U.S.C. § 702, the APA incorporates the familiar\nzone-of-interests test, which reflects a background principle\nof law that always “applies unless it is expressly negated,”\nBennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 163 (1997); see also Lexmark\nInt’l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118,\n129 (2014).6  That test requires a plaintiff to “establish that\nthe injury he complains of (his aggrievement, or the adverse\neffect upon him) falls within the ‘zone of interests’ sought to\nbe protected by the statutory provision whose violation forms\nthe legal basis for his complaint.”  Lujan v. NWF, 497 U.S. at\n6 The Supreme Court has not squarely addressed whether the zone-of-\ninterests test applies to a plaintiff who claims to have “suffer[ed] legal\nwrong because of agency action,” which is the other class of persons\nauthorized to sue under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 702.  See Lujan v. National\nWildlife Fed. (Lujan v. NWF), 497 U.S. 871, 882–83 (1990).  The\nOrganizations have not invoked any such theory here, so I have no\noccasion to address it.\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  6600  ooff  8822\n60 SIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP\n883 (quoting Clarke v. Securities Indus. Ass’n, 479 U.S. 388,\n396–97 (1987)).  This test “is not meant to be especially\ndemanding.”  Clarke, 479 U.S. at 399.  Because the APA was\nintended to confer “generous review” of agency action, the\nzone-of-interests test is more flexibly applied under that\nstatute than elsewhere, and it requires only a showing that the\nplaintiff is “arguably within the zone of interests to be\nprotected  or  regulated  by  the  statute  or  constitutional\nguarantee in question.”  Association of Data Processing Serv.\nOrgs., Inc. v. Camp (Data Processing), 397 U.S. 150, 153,\n156 (1970) (emphasis added); see also Bennett, 520 U.S.\nat 163 (“what comes within the zone of interests of a statute\nfor purposes of obtaining judicial review of administrative\naction under the generous review provisions of the APA may\nnot do so for other purposes”) (simplified).  Because an APA\nplaintiff need only show that its interests are “arguably”\nwithin the relevant zone of interests, “the benefit of any doubt\ngoes to the plaintiff.”  Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of\nPottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, 225 (2012). \nAlthough these standards are generous, the Organizations\nhave failed to satisfy them.\n1\nIn  applying  the  zone-of-interests  test,  we  must  first\nidentify the “statutory provision whose violation forms the\nlegal basis for [the] complaint” or the “gravamen of the\ncomplaint.”  Lujan v. NWF, 497 U.S. at 883, 886; see also Air\nCourier Conf., 498 U.S. at 529.  That question is easy here. \nThe Organizations’ complaint alleges that the challenged\ntransfers are not authorized by § 8005 and § 9002 because\n“[t]he diversion of funding to build a border wall or fence is\nnot based on unforeseen military requirements”; “the building\nof a permanent border wall is not a ‘military requirement’”;\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  6611  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP 61\nand “Congress has denied funding for Defendants’ planned\nwall construction, thus barring the Department of Defense\nfrom using transfers to fund it.”7  The Organizations allege\nthat,  because  Congress  thus  “has  not  authorized  the\nDepartment of Defense to transfer additional Defense funds\ninto the Drug Interdiction and Counter-Narcotics Activities\naccount for the purpose of supporting another agency, rather\nthan for military requirements,” the Appropriations Clause\nbars the transfers and “Defendants are acting ultra vires in\nseeking to transfer funds into the Drug Interdiction and\nCounter-Narcotics  Activities  account  for  the  purpose  of\nbuilding a permanent border wall.”  Given that the case turns\non whether the transfers met the criteria in § 8005, that statute\nis plainly the “gravamen of the complaint,” and it therefore\ndefines the applicable zone of interests.  Lujan v. NWF,\n497 U.S. at 886.\nAlthough the Organizations invoke the Appropriations\nClause  and  the  constitutional  separation  of  powers  in\ncontending that Defendants’ actions are unlawful, any such\nconstitutional violations here can be said to have occurred\nonly if the transfers violated the limitations  set forth in\n§  8005:  if  Congress  authorized  DoD  to  transfer  the\nappropriated funds from one account to another, and to spend\nthem  accordingly,  then  the  money  has  been  spent  “in\nConsequence of Appropriations made by Law,” U.S. CONST.\nart.  I,  §  9,  cl.  7,  and  the  Executive  has  not  otherwise\n7 Because the limitations on transfers set forth in § 8005 also apply to\ntransfers under § 9002, see 132 Stat. at 3042, the parties use “§ 8005” to\nrefer to both provisions, and I will generally do so as well.\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  6622  ooff  8822\n62 SIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP\ntransgressed  the  separation  of  powers.8    All  of  the\nOrganizations’  theories  for  challenging  the  transfers—\nwhether  styled  as  constitutional  claims  or  as  statutory\nclaims—thus  rise  or  fall  based  on  whether  DoD  has\ntransgressed the limitations on transfers set forth in § 8005. \nAs a result, § 8005 is obviously the “statute whose violation\nis the gravamen of the complaint.”  Lujan v. NWF, 497 U.S.\nat 886.  To maintain a claim under the APA, therefore, the\nOrganizations must establish that they are within the zone of\ninterests of § 8005.9\n8 The only possible exception is the Organizations’ argument that\n§ 8005 itself violates the Presentment Clause.  As explained below, that\ncontention is frivolous.  See infra at 71–72.\n9 The Organizations briefly contend that DoD has exceeded its\nauthority under § 284 and has violated the National Environmental Policy\nAct (“NEPA”), but even assuming arguendo that the Organizations have\na cause of action to raise any such challenges, they are patently without\nmerit.  The Organizations note that § 284 contains a special reporting\nrequirement for “small scale construction” projects, which are defined as\nprojects costing $750,000 or less, 10 U.S.C. § 284(h)(1)(B), (i)(3), and\nthey argue that this shows that Congress did not authorize projects on the\nscale at issue here.  The inference is a non sequitur: the fact that Congress\nrequires special reporting of these smaller projects does not mean that they\nare the only projects authorized.  Congress may have imposed such a\nunique reporting requirement in order to capture the sort of smaller-scale\nactivities that might otherwise have escaped its notice.  And the fact that\npast expenditures under § 284 have happened to be for more modest\nprojects is irrelevant, because nothing in the text of § 284 imposes any\nsuch  size  limits  on  the  projects  authorized  by  that  statute.    The\nOrganizations’ reliance on NEPA is likewise meritless.  We have upheld\nDHS’s waiver of NEPA under § 102(c) of IIRIRA, see In re Border\nInfrastructure Envtl. Litig., 915 F.3d 1213, 1225 (9th Cir. 2019), and the\ndistrict court correctly concluded that the waiver applies to construction\nthat DoD undertakes under § 284 to “provide support” to DHS at DHS’s\n“request[],” 10 U.S.C. § 284.

First Nat’l Bank &\nTrust Co. (NCUA), 522 U.S. 479, 492 (1998) (simplified). \nIdentifying the interests protected by § 8005 is not difficult,\nand here the Organizations’ asserted interests are not among\nthem.\nSection 8005 is a grant of general transfer authority that\nallows the Secretary of Defense, if he determines “that such\naction is necessary in the national interest” and if the Office\nof Management and Budget approves, to transfer from one\nDoD “appropriation” into another up to $4 billion of the\nfunds  that  have  been  appropriated  under  the  DoD\nAppropriations Act “for military functions (except military\nconstruction).”  See 132 Stat. at 2999.  Section 8005 contains\nfive provisos that further regulate this transfer authority, and\nthe only limitations on the Secretary’s authority that the\nOrganizations claim were violated here are all contained in\nthe first such proviso.  That proviso states that “such authority\nto transfer may not be used unless for higher priority items,\nbased on unforeseen military requirements, than those for\nwhich originally appropriated and in no case where the item\nfor  which  funds  are  requested  has  been  denied  by  the\nCongress.”  Id.10  The remaining provisos require prompt\nnotice to Congress “of all transfers made pursuant to this\n10 Similar language has been codified into permanent law.

Id.\nFocusing on “the particular provision of law upon which\nthe plaintiff relies,” Bennett, 520 U.S. at 175–76, makes clear\nthat § 8005 as a whole, and its first proviso in particular,\nare  aimed  at  tightening  congressional  control  over  the\nappropriations  process.    The  first  proviso’s  general\nprohibition on transferring funds for any item that “has been\ndenied by the Congress” is, on its face, a prohibition on using\nthe  transfer  authority  to  effectively  reverse  Congress’s\nspecific  decision  to  deny  funds  to  DoD  for  that  item. \n132 Stat. at 2999.  The second major limitation imposed by\nthe first proviso states that the transfer authority is not to be\nused unless, considering the items “for which [the funds\nwere] originally appropriated,” there are “higher priority\nitems” for which the funds should now be used in light of\n“military requirements” that were “unforeseen” in DoD’s\nrequest for Fiscal Year 2019 appropriations.  Id.  The obvious\nfocus of this restriction is likewise to protect congressional\njudgments about appropriations by (1) restricting DoD’s\nability to reprioritize the use of funds differently from how\nCongress decided to do so and (2) precluding DoD from\ntransferring funds appropriated by Congress for “military\nfunctions”  for  purposes  that  do  not  reflect  “military\nrequirements.”    The  remaining  provisos,  including  the\ncongressional reporting requirement, all similarly aim to\nmaintain congressional control over appropriations.  And all\nof the operative restrictions in § 8005 that the Organizations\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  6655  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP 65\ninvoke here are focused solely on limiting DoD’s ability to\nuse  the  transfer  authority  to  reverse  the  congressional\njudgments reflected in DoD’s appropriations.\nIn  addition  to  preserving  congressional  control  over\nDoD’s appropriations, § 8005 also aims to give DoD some\nmeasure of flexibility to make necessary changes.  Notably,\nin  authorizing  the  Secretary  to  make  transfers  among\nappropriations, § 8005’s first proviso specifies only one\ncriterion that he must consider in exercising that discretion:\nhe must determine whether the item for which the funds will\nbe used is a “higher priority item[]” in light of “unforeseen\nmilitary requirements.”  132 Stat. at 2999 (emphasis added). \nUnder the statute, he need not consider any other factor\nconcerning either the original use for which the funds were\nappropriated or the new use to which they will now be put.\nIn light of these features of § 8005, the “interests” that the\nOrganizations claim are “affected by the agency action in\nquestion” are not “among” the “interests arguably to be\nprotected” by § 8005.  NCUA, 522 U.S. at 492 (simplified). \nIn  particular,  the  Organizations’  asserted  recreational,\naesthetic, and environmental interests clearly lie outside the\nzone of interests protected by § 8005.  The statute does not\nmention recreational, aesthetic, and environmental interests,\nnor does it require the Secretary to consider such interests. \nOn the contrary, the statute requires him only to consider\nwhether an item is a “higher priority” in light of “military\nrequirements,” and it is otherwise entirely neutral as to the\nuses to which the funds will be put.  Indeed, that neutrality is\nreflected on the face of the statute, which says that, once the\ntransfer is made, the funds are “merged with and . . . available\nfor the same purposes, and for the same time period, as the\nappropriation  or  fund  to  which  transferred.”    132  Stat.\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  6666  ooff  8822\n66 SIERRA CLUB V.

Because the alleged recreational,\naesthetic, and environmental harms that the Organizations\nassert here play no role in the analysis that § 8005 requires\nthe Secretary to conduct, and are not among the harms that\n§  8005’s  limitations  seek  to  address  or  protect,  the\nOrganizations’ interests in avoiding these harms are not\nwithin § 8005’s zone of interests.\nMoreover, focusing on the specific interests for which the\nOrganizations have presented sufficient evidentiary support\nat the summary-judgment stage, see Lujan v. NWF, 497 U.S.\nat 884–85, further confirms that, in deciding whether to\nredirect excess military personnel funds under § 8005 to\nassist DHS by building fencing to stop international drug\nsmuggling, the Acting Secretary of Defense did not have to\ngive  even  the  slightest  consideration  to  whether  that\nreprogramming of funds would disrupt views of the desert\nlandscape or affect local flora and fauna.  Put simply, the\nOrganizations’  recreational,  aesthetic,  and  environmental\ninterests are “‘so marginally related to . . . the purposes\nimplicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed\nthat  Congress  intended  to  permit  the  suit.’”    Patchak,\n567 U.S. at 225 (quoting Clarke, 479 U.S. at 399).\n3\nThe Organizations nonetheless claim that they fall within\n§ 8005’s zone of interests because § 8005 was “aimed at\ntightening congressional control over executive spending,”\nand the Organizations’ interests do not “meaningfully diverge\nfrom Congress’s interests in enacting the statute.”  This\ncontention fails.  As the Supreme Court made clear in Lujan\nv. NWF, the zone-of-interests test requires the plaintiff to\nmake a factual showing that the plaintiff itself, or someone\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  6677  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V.

I am aware of no precedent that would support the\nview that these Organizations can represent the interests of\nCongress (akin to NWF’s representation of the interests of its\nmembers), much less that they can do so merely because they\nare sympathetic to Congress’s perceived policy objectives.11 \nBut the Organizations do not actually rely on such a novel\ntheory.    Instead,  the  Organizations  suggest  that,  merely\nbecause their overall litigation objectives here do not diverge\nfrom those of Congress, they have thereby satisfied the zone-\nof-interests test with respect to their own interests.  This\ntheory is clearly wrong.\nThe critical flaw in the Organizations’ analysis is that it\nrests, not on the interests they are asserting (preservation of\nlandscape, flora, fauna, etc.), but on the legal theory that the\nOrganizations invoke to protect those interests here.  But the\nzone-of-interests test focuses on the former and not the latter. \nSee Lujan v. NWF, 497 U.S. at 885–89.

By definition, anyone who alleges\na violation of a particular statute has thereby invoked a legal\ntheory  that  does  not  “meaningfully  diverge”  from  the\ninterests of those other persons or entities who are within that\nstatute’s zone-of-interests.  Such a tautological congruence\nbetween  the  Organizations’  legal  theory  and  Congress’s\ninstitutional interests is not sufficient to satisfy the zone-of-\ninterests test here.\nThe  Organizations  suggest  that  their  approach  is\nsupported  by  the  D.C.  Circuit’s  decision  in  Scheduled\nAirlines  Traffic  Offices,  Inc.  v.  Department  of  Defense,\n87 F.3d 1356 (D.C. Cir. 1996), but that is wrong.  As the\nopinion in that case makes clear, the D.C. Circuit was relying\non the same traditional zone-of-interests test, under which a\nplaintiff’s  interests  are  “outside  the  statute’s  ‘zone  of\ninterests’ only ‘if the plaintiff’s interests are so marginally\nrelated to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the\nstatute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress\nintended to permit the suit.’”  87 F.3d at 1360 (quoting\nClarke, 479 U.S. at 399).  The court mentioned “congruence”\nin the course of explaining why the plaintiff’s interests in that\ncase  were  “not  more  likely  to  frustrate  than  to  further\nstatutory  objectives,”  i.e.,  why  those  interests  were  not\ninconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute.  Id.\n(simplified).  It did not thereby suggest—and could not\nproperly have suggested—that the mere lack of any such\ninconsistency is alone sufficient under the zone-of-interests\ntest.  Here, the problem is not that the Organizations’ interests\nare inconsistent with the purposes of § 8005, but rather that\nthey are too “marginally related” to those purposes.

Sierra Club v. Trump, 929 F.3d at 715 (N.R.\nSmith, J., dissenting) (suggesting that “those who would have\nbeen entitled to the funds as originally appropriated” may be\nwithin the zone of interests of § 8005), but in any event, we\nare not entitled to bend the otherwise applicable—and already\nlenient—standards to ensure that someone will be able to sue\nin this case or others like it.\nB\nAs noted earlier, the Organizations only invoke the APA\nas a fallback option, and they instead insist that they may\nassert claims under the Constitution, as well as an equitable\ncause  of  action  to  enjoin  “ultra  vires”  conduct.    The\nOrganizations do not have a cause of action under either of\nthese theories.\n1\nThe Organizations contend that they are not required to\nsatisfy any zone-of-interests test to the extent that they assert\nnon-APA causes of action to enjoin Executive officials from\ntaking unconstitutional action.12  Even assuming that an\n12 It is not entirely clear that the Organizations are alternatively\ncontending that APA claims to enjoin unconstitutional conduct, see 5\nU.S.C. § 706(2)(B), are exempt from the zone-of-interests test.

The Organizations have failed\nto allege the sort of constitutional claim that might give rise\nto such an equitable action, because their “constitutional”\nclaim is effectively the very same § 8005-based claim dressed\nup in constitutional garb.  And even if this claim counted as\na “constitutional” one, it would still be governed by the same\nzone of interests defined by the relevant limitations in § 8005.\na\nThe Organizations assert three constitutional claims in\ntheir operative complaint: (1) that Defendants have violated\nthe  constitutional  separation  of  powers  by  “usurp[ing]\nCongress’s legislative authority”; (2) that Defendants have\nviolated  the  Presentment  Clause  by  “modify[ing]  or\nrepeal[ing] Congress’s appropriations legislation by executive\nproclamation, rather than by law”; and (3) that Defendants\nhave violated the Appropriations Clause by “allocat[ing]\nmoney from the Department of the Treasury by executive\nproclamation, rather than by law, and in contravention of\nrestrictions contained in Congress’s appropriations’ laws.” \nProcessing, 397 U.S. at 153 (zone-of-interests test requires APA claimant\nto show that its interest “is arguably within the zone of interests to be\nprotected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in\nquestion”).  But in all events, any such APA-based claim to enjoin\nunconstitutional  conduct  would  fail  for  the  same  reasons  as  the\nOrganizations’ purported free-standing equitable claim to enjoin such\nconduct.\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  7711  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP 71\nAs clarified in their subsequent briefing, the Organizations\nassert  both  what  I  will  call  a  “strong”  form  of  these\nconstitutional arguments and a more “limited” form.  In its\nstrong form, the Organizations’ argument is that, even if\n§  8005  authorized  the  transfers  in  question  here,  those\ntransfers nonetheless violated the Presentment Clause.  In its\nmore limited form, the Organizations’ argument is that the\ntransfers violated the separation of powers, the Presentment\nClause, and the Appropriations Clause because the transfers\nwere not authorized by § 8005.\nI need not address whether the Organizations have an\nequitable cause of action to assert the strong form of their\nconstitutional argument, because in my view that argument\non the merits is so “wholly insubstantial and frivolous” that\nit would not even give rise to federal jurisdiction.  Bell v.\nHood, 327 U.S. 678, 682–83 (1946); see also Steel Co.,\n523 U.S. at 89.  If § 8005 allowed the transfers here, then that\nnecessarily means that the Executive has properly spent funds\nthat Congress, by statute, has appropriated and allowed to be\nspent for that purpose.  Cf. Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182,\n192  (1993)  (“allocation  of  funds  from  a  lump-sum\nappropriation is another administrative decision traditionally\nregarded  as  committed  to  agency  discretion”).    By\ntransferring funds after finding that the statutory conditions\nfor doing so are met, an agency thereby “execut[es] the policy\nthat Congress had embodied in the statute” and does not\nunilaterally  alter  or  repeal  any  law  in  violation  of  the\nPresentment Clause or the separation of powers.  See Clinton\nv. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 444 (1998).  If anything,\nit is the Organizations’ theory—that the federal courts must\ngive effect to an alleged broader congressional judgment\nagainst border funding regardless of whether that judgment\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  7722  ooff  8822\n72 SIERRA CLUB V.

Under Dalton v. Specter, 511 U.S. 462\n(1994),  this  theory—despite  its  constitutional  garb—is\nproperly  classified  as  “a  statutory  one,”  id.  at  474.    It\ntherefore does not fall within the scope of the asserted non-\nAPA equitable cause of action to enjoin unconstitutional\nconduct.13\nIn Dalton, the Court addressed a non-APA claim to enjoin\nExecutive  officials  from  implementing  an  allegedly\nunconstitutional Presidential decision to close certain military\nbases under the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act\nof 1990.  511 U.S. at 471.14  But the claim in Dalton was not\nthat the President had directly transgressed an applicable\nconstitutional limitation; rather, the claim was that, because\nExecutive officials “violated the procedural requirements” of\nthe  statute  on  which  the  President’s  decision  ultimately\nrested,  the  President  thereby  “act[ed]  in  excess  of  his\nstatutory  authority”  and  therefore  “violate[d]  the\n13 There remains the Organizations’ claim that statutory violations\nmay be enjoined under a non-APA ultra vires cause of action for equitable\nrelief, but that also fails for the reasons discussed below.  See infra at\n79–80.\n14 The plaintiffs in Dalton also asserted a claim under the APA itself,\nbut that claim failed for the separate reason that the challenged final action\nwas taken by the President personally, and the President is not an\n“agency” for purposes of the APA.  See 511 U.S. at 469.\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  7733  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V.

As the Court explained, its\n“cases do not support the proposition that every action by the\nPresident, or by another executive official, in excess of his\nstatutory  authority  is  ipso  facto  in  violation  of  the\nConstitution.”    Id.  at  472.    The  Court  distinguished\nYoungstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579\n(1952), on the ground that there “the Government disclaimed\nany statutory authority for the President’s seizure of steel\nmills,” and as a result the Constitution itself supplied the rule\nof decision for determining the legality of the President’s\nactions.  Dalton, 511 U.S. at 473.  Because the “only basis of\nauthority asserted was the President’s inherent constitutional\npower as the Executive and the Commander in Chief of the\nArmed Forces,” Youngstown thus “necessarily turned on\nwhether the Constitution authorized the President’s actions.” \nId. (emphasis added).  By contrast, given that the claim in\nDalton was that the President had violated the Constitution\nbecause Executive officials had “violated the terms of the\n1990 Act,” the terms of that statute provided the applicable\nrule of decision and the claim was therefore “a statutory one.” \nId. at 474.  And because those claims sought to enjoin\nconduct  on  the  grounds  that  it  violated  statutory\nrequirements, it was subject to the “longstanding” limitation\nthat non-APA “review is not available when the statute in\nquestion  commits  the  decision  to  the  discretion  of  the\nPresident.”  Id.\nUnder  Dalton,  the  Organizations’  purported\n“constitutional”  claims—at  least  in  their  more  limited\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  7744  ooff  8822\n74 SIERRA CLUB V.

Here, as in\nDalton, Defendants have “claimed” the “statutory authority”\nof § 8005, and any asserted violation of the Constitution\nwould occur only if, and only because, Defendants’ conduct\nis assertedly not authorized by § 8005.  Id. at 473.  The rule\nof  decision  for  this  dispute  is  thus  not  supplied,  as  in\nYoungstown, by the Constitution; rather, it is supplied only by\n§  8005.    Id.  at  473–74.    Because  these  claims  by  the\nOrganizations are thus “statutory” under Dalton, they may\nonly proceed, if at all, under an equitable cause of action to\nenjoin ultra vires conduct, and they would be subject to any\nlimitations  applicable  to such  claims.    Id. at  474.  The\nOrganizations do assert such a fallback claim here, but it fails\nfor the reasons I explain below.  See infra at 79–80.\nb\nBut even if the Organizations’ claims may properly be\nclassified as constitutional ones for purposes of the particular\nequitable cause of action they invoke here, those claims\nwould still fail.\nTo  the  extent  that  the  Organizations  argue  that  the\nConstitution itself grants a cause of action allowing any\nplaintiff with an Article III injury to sue to enjoin an alleged\nviolation  of  the  Appropriations  Clause,  the  Presentment\nClause, or the separation of powers, there is no support for\nsuch a theory.

Exceptional  Child  Ctr.,  Inc.,\n575 U.S. 320 (2015).  There, the Court rejected the view that\nthe Supremacy Clause itself created a private right of action\nfor equitable relief against preempted statutes, and instead\nheld that any such equitable claim rested on “judge-made”\nremedies that are subject to “express and implied statutory\nlimitations.”  Id. at 325–27.  The Supremacy Clause provides\na  particularly  apt  analogy  here,  because  (like  the\nAppropriations Clause) the asserted “unconstitutionality” of\nthe challenged action generally depends upon whether it falls\nwithin or outside the terms of a federal statute: a state statute\nis “unconstitutional under the Supremacy Clause” only if it is\n“contrary  to  federal  law,”  Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena\nAirport Auth. v.

Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 325–26.15\nThe Appropriations Clause thus does not itself create a\nconstitutionally required cause of action that extends to the\nlimits of Article III.  On the contrary, any equitable cause of\naction to enforce that clause would rest on a “judge-made”\nremedy: as Armstrong observed, “[t]he ability to sue to enjoin\nunconstitutional actions by state and federal officers is the\ncreation of courts of equity, and reflects a long history of\njudicial review of illegal executive action, tracing back to\nEngland.”  575 U.S. at 327.

Moreover, to the extent that these clauses\nprotect individual liberty, they both do so only as a consequence of\nprotecting  congressional  authority  within  our  overall  constitutional\nstructure.

TRUMP\n562 U.S. 170, 176–77 (2011) (construing a cause of action as\nextending to “any person injured in the Article III sense”\nwould often produce “absurd consequences” and is for that\nreason rarely done).  And given the unique nature of an\nAppropriations  Clause  claim,  as  just  discussed,  the  line\nbetween constitutional and unconstitutional conduct here is\ndefined entirely by the limitations in § 8005, and therefore\nthe  relevant  zone  of  interests  for  the  Organizations’\nAppropriations-Clause-based equitable claim remains defined\nby  those  limitations.    Thus,  contrary  to  the  majority’s\nconclusion, see Maj. Opin. at 39–40, the Organizations are\noutside the applicable zone of interests for this claim as well.\nIn arguing for a contrary view, the Organizations rely\nheavily on United States v. McIntosh, asserting that there\nwe  granted  non-APA  injunctive  relief  based  on  the\nAppropriations  Clause  without  inquiring  whether  the\nclaimants were within the zone of interests of the underlying\nappropriations statute.  McIntosh cannot bear the considerable\nweight that the Organizations place on it.\nIn McIntosh, we asserted interlocutory jurisdiction over\nthe district courts’ refusal to enjoin the expenditure of funds\nto prosecute the defendants—an expenditure that allegedly\nviolated  an  appropriations  rider  barring  the  Justice\nDepartment from spending funds to prevent certain States\nfrom “‘implementing their own laws that authorize the use,\ndistribution,  possession,  or  cultivation  of  medical\nmarijuana.’”  833 F.3d at 1175; see also id. at 1172–73.  We\nheld that the defendants had Article III standing and that, if\nthe Department was in fact “spending money in violation” of\nthat rider in prosecuting the defendants, that would produce\na violation of the Appropriations Clause that could be raised\nby the defendants in challenging their prosecutions.  Id.\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  7799  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP 79\nat 1175.  After construing the meaning of the rider, we then\nremanded the matter for a determination whether the rider\nwas  being  violated.    Id.  at  1179.    Contrary  to  the\nOrganizations’ dog-that-didn’t-bark theory, nothing can be\ngleaned from the fact that the zone-of-interests test was never\ndiscussed in McIntosh.  See Cooper Indus., Inc. v. Aviall\nServs, Inc., 543 U.S. 157, 170 (2004) (“‘Questions which\nmerely lurk in the record, neither brought to the attention of\nthe court nor ruled upon, are not to be considered as having\nbeen  so  decided  as  to  constitute  precedents.’”)  (quoting\nWebster v. Fall, 266 U.S. 507, 511 (1925)).  Moreover, any\nsuch silence seems more likely to have been due to the fact\nthat it was so overwhelmingly obvious that the defendants\nwere within the rider’s zone of interests that the point was\nincontestable and uncontested.  An asserted interest in not\ngoing to prison for complying with state medical-marijuana\nlaws seems well within the zone of interests of a statute\nprohibiting interference with the implementation of such state\nlaws.\n2\nThe only remaining question is whether the Organizations\nmay evade the APA’s zone-of-interests test by asserting a\nnon-APA claim for ultra vires conduct in excess of statutory\nauthority.  Even assuming that such a cause of action exists\nalongside the APA, cf. Trudeau v. Federal Trade Comm’n,\n456 F.3d 178, 189–90 (D.C. Cir. 2006), I conclude that it\nwould be subject to the same zone-of-interests limitations as\nthe Organizations’ APA claims and therefore likewise fails.\nFor the same reasons discussed above, any such equitable\ncause of action rests on a judge-made remedy that is subject\nto the zone-of-interests  test.  See supra at 74–79.  The\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  8800  ooff  8822\n80 SIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP\nOrganizations identify no case from the Supreme Court or\nthis court affirmatively holding that the zone-of-interests test\ndoes not apply to a non-APA equitable cause of action to\nenjoin  conduct  allegedly  in  excess  of  express  statutory\nlimitations on statutory authority, and I am aware of none. \nIndeed, it makes little sense, when evaluating a claim that\nExecutive officials exceeded the limitations  in a federal\nstatute, not to ask whether the plaintiff is within the zone of\ninterests protected by those statutory limitations.  Cf. Haitian\nRefugee Ctr. v. Gracey, 809 F.2d 794, 811 n.14 (D.C. Cir.\n1987) (although plaintiff asserting ultra vires claim may not\nneed to show that its interests “fall within the zones of\ninterests of the constitutional and statutory powers invoked”\nby Executive officials, when “a particular constitutional or\nstatutory provision was intended to protect persons like the\nlitigant  by  limiting  the  authority  conferred,”  then  “the\nlitigant’s interest may be said to fall within the zone protected\nby  the  limitation”)  (emphasis  added).17    Here,  those\nlimitations are supplied by § 8005, and the Organizations are\nnot within the zone of interests of that statute.18\n17 The majority thus relies on the wrong portion of Judge Bork’s\nopinion in Haitian Refugee Center.  See Maj. Opin. at 37–39.  This case\nturns on a “statutory provision” that “limit[s] the authority conferred.” \n809 F.2d at 811 n.14.  If the Executive had contended that it had power to\ntransfer the funds regardless of § 8005, then this case would look more\nlike Youngstown, but no such extravagant claim has been pressed in this\ncase.  On the contrary, Defendants concede that, if the requirements of\n§ 8005 were not met, then the transfers were unlawful.\n18 Even if the Organizations were correct that the zone-of-interests test\ndoes not apply to a non-APA equitable cause of action, that would not\nnecessarily  mean  that  such  equitable  jurisdiction  extends,  as  the\nOrganizations suggest, to the outer limits of Article III.  Declining to apply\nthe  APA’s  generous  zone-of-interests  test  might  arguably  render\napplicable the sort of narrower review of agency action that preceded the\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  8811  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP 81\n*     *     *\nGiven that each of the Organizations’ asserted theories\nfail, the Organizations lack any cause of action to challenge\nthe DoD’s transfer of funds under § 8005.\nIV\nAlternatively, even if the Organizations had a cause of\naction, their claims would fail on the merits, because the\nchallenged transfers did not violate § 8005 or § 9002.  In the\ncompanion  appeal,  California  v.  Trump,  the  majority\nconcluded that § 8005 and § 9002 did not authorize the\ntransfers at issue, and I concluded that these provisions did\nauthorize the transfers.  Just as the majority “reaffirm[s] this\nholding  here  and  conclude[s]  that  Section  8005  did  not\nauthorize the transfer of funds,” Maj. Opin. at 24, I reaffirm\nmy previous conclusion that § 8005 and § 9002 authorized\nthe transfers.\nV\nBased on the foregoing, I conclude that at least the Sierra\nClub has Article III standing, but that the Organizations lack\nany cause of action to challenge these § 8005 and § 9002\ntransfers.  Alternatively, if the Organizations did have a cause\nof action, their claims fail on the merits as a matter of law\nbecause the transfers complied with the limitations in § 8005\nand § 9002.  I therefore would reverse the district court’s\npartial grant of summary judgment to the Organizations and\nwould  remand  the  matter  with  instructions  to  grant\nAPA standards articulated in Data Processing, 397 U.S. at 153.

Every court  to  address  the  question  has \nconcluded that the wall construction is illegal. A year ago, at an early stage of this \nlitigation and the disputed construction, this Court granted an emergency stay of an \ninjunction against the construction. Since then, intervening events have made clear \nthat should that stay remain in effect, it will not preserve the status quo, but hand \nDefendants-Respondents  (“Defendants”)  a complete victory despite  having lost in \nevery court.  \nWhen this Court granted its initial stay, it presumably assumed that it was \nmerely granting interim relief, not deciding the merits in the guise of stay. That is no \nlonger the case. At the same time, a series of intervening decisions, from the court \nbelow and several other courts, have strengthened Plaintiffs’ claims that Defendants’ \nactions are both unlawful and subject to judicial redress.    \nDefendants have spent the past year rushing construction of a border wall that \nCongress denied and that multiple courts  have all found unlawful.  The court of \nappeals has now affirmed the injunction that this Court stayed, but the government \nhas 150 days to seek certiorari. At this juncture, the Court’s stay, far from preserving \nthe status quo, will  permit Defendants to complete their project and threatens to \n4 \n \n\ndeprive Plaintiffs of a remedy.  The Court should therefore lift the stay so that it may \nconsider any certiorari petition in the ordinary course. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Underlying Facts \nThe President sought, and Congress denied, funding to construct a wall across \nthe  lands  that  Plaintiffs’  members  live  near,  use,  protect,  and  treasure.  After \nCongress “repeatedly declined to provide the amount of funding requested by the \nPresident,” the “President announced that he would not sign any legislation that did \nnot allocate substantial funds to border wall construction.” App. 10a.  \nThe President’s  public challenge triggered “the longest partial government \nshutdown in United States history.” App. 10a. During the shutdown, the White House \n“requested $5.7 billion to fund the construction of approximately 234 miles of new \nphysical barrier.” App. 10a. “After 35 days, the government shutdown ended without \nan agreement to provide increased border wall funding in the amount requested by \nthe President.” App. 10a. Congress denied the President’s request on February 14, \n2019, instead passing the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019 (“CAA”), Pub. L. \nNo. 116-6, div. A, 133 Stat. 13 (2019). The CAA made available only $1.375 billion for \nwall construction, and restricted construction to eastern Texas, in the United States \nBorder Patrol’s Rio Grande Valley Sector. On February 15, the President signed the \nCAA into law. \nOn the same  day that Congress’s  funding decision became law,  the White \nHouse announced that the administration would act unilaterally to spend billions of \n5 \n \n\ndollars above and beyond Congress’s appropriation. This sum included “$2.5 billion \nof Department of Defense (‘DoD’) funds that could be transferred to provide support \nfor counterdrug activities of other federal government agencies under 10 U.S.C. § 284 \n(‘Section 284’),” App. 11a, a statute providing for “construction of roads and fences \nand installation of lighting to block drug smuggling corridors across international \nboundaries of the United States,” 10 U.S.C. § 284(b)(7). In addition, the White House \nannounced that “up to $3.6 billion” of military construction funds would be diverted \nunder 10 U.S.C. § 2808 (“Section 2808”). App. 206a. \nTen days later—less  than two  weeks  after Congress denied  the executive \nbranch’s request to construct approximately 234 miles of new physical barrier in \nareas identified as the top Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) priorities—DHS \nformally requested that the Department of Defense (“DoD”) fund “approximately 218 \nmiles” of new walls in CBP priority areas. App. 12a. In the following months DoD \napproved $2.5 billion in Section 284 expenditures for DHS construction, as specified \nin the February 15 White House announcement. App. 12a. \nNone of the Section 284 construction was paid for by funds that Congress had \nappropriated for DoD’s Section 284 account, and the construction projects chosen by \nthe executive branch directly contravened the limitations Congress placed on border \nwall  construction. At the time Defendants  embarked on their plan to circumvent \nCongress, the Section 284 account contained “less than one tenth of the $2.5 billion \nneeded to complete those projects.”  App. 12a. So DoD  invoked Section 8005 and \nSection 9002 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2019, Pub. L. No. \n6 \n \n\n115-245, 132 Stat. 2981 (2018) (“Section 8005”) to transfer “$1 billion from Army \npersonnel funds” and an additional “1.5 billion from ‘various excess appropriations,’ \nwhich contained funds originally appropriated for purposes such as modification of \nin-service missiles and support for U.S. allies in Afghanistan.” App. 12a–13a. These \ntransfer authorities are explicitly limited by Congress and “may not be used unless \nfor higher priority items, based on unforeseen military requirements, than those for \nwhich originally appropriated and in no case where the item for which funds are \nrequested has been denied by the Congress.” App.13a–14a. \nB. Proceedings Prior to this Court’s Grant of a Stay \nPlaintiffs sued on February 19, 2019, one business day after the president’s \nannouncement  that  he  intended  to  construct  the  wall  that  Congress  rejected. \nPlaintiffs’ members live near and use the lands on which Defendants seek to construct \na massive, multibillion-dollar wall. This unique landscape is renowned for its beauty \nand archaeological, historic, and biological value, and includes protected public lands, \nincluding Organ Pipe National Monument, Coronado National Memorial, the Cabeza \nPrieta National Wildlife Refuge, and the San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge.  \nBeginning on April 4, 2019, as Defendants  made public their construction \ndecisions,  Plaintiffs  sought injunctions against specific  wall  segments.  To enable \nexpeditious and orderly review and disposition of this action, Plaintiffs sought partial \nsummary judgment and a permanent injunction on June 12, 2019.  \nOn May 24, 2019, the district court entered a preliminary injunction barring \nDefendants’ initial transfer of $1 billion to construct wall sections in Arizona and New \n7 \n \n\nMexico. The district court concluded that Defendants’ plan was unlawful, because \nthey had not identified any statutory authority that permitted them to spend funds \non wall construction in excess of what Congress had appropriated in the CAA. In \nparticular,  the district  court found that the wall  construction at issue  here was \n“denied by Congress” and was not “unforeseen,” thus failing the requirements of the \nauthority Defendants had invoked, Section 8005 of the DoD Appropriations Act. App. \n229a–234a. \nThe district  court rejected Defendants’  argument that Congress had never \n“denied” the wall construction projects, finding that “the reality is that Congress was \npresented  with—and  declined to grant—a $5.7 billion request  for border barrier \nconstruction.” App. 232a. The court observed that Defendants’ reading of “denied,” \nwhich would apply only to specific rejections of budget-line requests, would defeat the \nentire purpose of the limitation because Defendants could simply (as they did here) \nrequest items  without  reference to specific  budget lines  or subcomponents.  App. \n230a–231a, 235a–236a; see also Office of Management & Budget Letter 1, Dist. Ct. \nECF No. 168-2, Ex. 13 (RJN) (“The President requests $5.7 billion for construction of \na steel barrier for the Southwest border.”). \nThe district court likewise  rejected Defendants’ contention that the need for \nwall funds was “unforeseen.” For more than a year before the transfers, the Executive \nBranch requested, and Congress considered, the allocation of billions of dollars to \nbuild a border wall in these same lands. App. 233a–234a.  \n8 \n \n\nThe  district  court  also  noted  that  Defendants’  position  raised  serious \nconstitutional  concerns  under  the  Appropriations  Clause  and  the  separation  of \npowers:  “[T]he  position  that  when  Congress declines  the Executive’s  request  to \nappropriate funds, the Executive nonetheless may simply find a way to spend those \nfunds ‘without  Congress’ does not square with  fundamental separation of powers \nprinciples dating back to the earliest days of our Republic.” App. 252a–253a.  \nThe district court rejected Defendants’ argument that Plaintiffs were required \nto satisfy a zone-of-interests test with respect to Section 8005. It held that Plaintiffs \ndid not “seek[] to vindicate a right protected by a statutory provision,” but instead \nsought “equitable relief against a defendant for exceeding its statutory authority.” \nApp. 228a.  \nOn  June  28,  2019,  the  district  court  issued  a  permanent  injunction \nincorporating its prior reasoning on the merits. On the equities of the injunction, the \ndistrict court “note[d] that Congress considered all of Defendants’ proffered needs for \nborder barrier construction, weighed the public interest in such construction against \nDefendants’ request for taxpayer money, and struck what it considered to be the \nproper balance—in the public’s interest—by making available only $1.375 billion in \nfunding, which was for certain border barrier construction not at issue here.” App. \n195a.  \nDefendants  sought  an  emergency  stay  of  the  district  court’s  preliminary \ninjunction. On July 3, 2019, the court of appeals denied the stay motion in a published \n2-1 opinion. Judges Clifton and Friedland, writing for the court, held that “[b]ecause \n9 \n \n\nsection 8005 did not authorize DoD to reprogram the funds—and Defendants do not \nand cannot argue that any other statutory or constitutional provision authorized the \nreprogramming—the use of those funds violates the constitutional requirement that \nthe Executive Branch not spend money absent an appropriation from Congress.” \nSierra Club v. Trump, 929 F.3d 670, 676 (9th Cir. 2019). \nJudge  Smith  dissented,  concluding  that  Plaintiffs  could  not  bring  an \nAdministrative Procedure Act claim,  and that the APA foreclosed  the judiciary’s \npower in equity to enjoin the Executive Branch actions here. Id. at 713–717 (Smith, \nJ., dissenting). In dissenting from the majority’s refusal to grant a stay, Judge Smith \nalso reasoned (more than a year ago) that “the injunction will only be stayed for a \nshort  period,”  thus  minimizing,  “[i]n  the  narrow  context  of  this  stay  motion,” \nenvironmental injuries that might otherwise “be significant in the long term.” Id. at \n718 & n.15.  \nOn July 12, 2019, Defendants filed a stay application with  this Court. The \nCourt granted the stay on July 26, 2019. App. 185a.  The Court explained that \n“Among the reasons is that the Government has made a sufficient showing at this \nstage that  the plaintiffs  have no cause of action  to obtain review  of  the Acting \nSecretary’s compliance with Section 8005.” App. 185a. \nC. Proceedings Since this Court’s Stay \nJudicial decisions in this case and several related cases have issued since the \nCourt’s stay. All agree that the government’s actions are subject to review; and each \none that reached the merits ruled that the government’s actions are unlawful.  \n10 \n \n\nOn June 26, 2020, a separate court of appeals panel affirmed the district court’s \ninjunction on the merits in a comprehensive decision. Writing for the court of appeals, \nChief Judge Thomas found that Congress did not appropriate funds for border wall \nconstruction, and that Defendants could not rely on Section 8005 to make up the \nshortfall by transferring billions from the military budget to DHS’s unfunded wall \nprojects.  The  court  of  appeals  set  forth  its  reasoning  that  Section  8005  was \ninapplicable to the border wall expenditures in an opinion filed the same day in the \ncompanion case, State of California, et al. v. Trump, et al., Nos. 19-16299 & 19-16336, \n(9th Cir. June 26, 2020), App. 119a.  \nThe  court  of  appeals  agreed  with  the  district  court  that  border  wall \nconstruction was not “unforeseen.” App. 119a–124a. It pointed out that Defendants’ \nposition—that a Section 284 request is foreseen only at the moment it is received by \nDoD—“would  swallow  the  rule  and  undermine  Congress’s  constitutional \nappropriations power,” and would be “inconsistent with the purpose of Section 8005: \nto ‘tighten congressional control of the reprogramming process.’” App. 122a (quoting \nH.R. Rep. No. 93-662, at 16 (1973)). Moreover, the historical record demonstrated \nthat DoD did, in fact, anticipate just such a request for Section 284 funds. App. 122a–\n123a.  \nIn addition, the court of appeals found that construction of border wall sections \naimed at a civilian law enforcement agency’s counterdrug mission is not a “military \nrequirement,” and Congress limited the use of Section 8005 to such requirements. \nApp. 124a–128a. “To conclude that supporting projects unconnected to any military \n11 \n \n\npurpose  or  installation  satisfies  the  meaning  of  ‘military  requirement’  would \neffectively write the term out of Section 8005.” App. 128a. \nThe court of appeals also agreed with the district court that “Congress’s broad \nand resounding denial resulting in a 35-day partial government shutdown  must \nconstitute a previous denial for purposes  of Section 8005.” App. 129a. The court \n“decline[d] to impose upon Congress an obligation to deny every possible source of \nfunding when it refuses to fund a particular project,” observing that “surely when \nCongress withheld additional funding for the border wall, it intended to withhold \nadditional funding for the wall, regardless of its source.” App. 129a.  \nBecause Section 8005 was  inapplicable, and “the Executive Branch lacked \nindependent constitutional authority to authorize the transfer of funds,” the court of \nappeals concluded that Defendants’ plan to transfer $2.5 billion in taxpayer funds to \nborder wall construction was unlawful. App. 25a. \nThe court of appeals determined that Sierra Club, whose members are injured \nby Defendants’  efforts  to evade Congress’s appropriations  decisions,  “has both a \nconstitutional and an ultra vires cause of action.” App. 25a. The court of appeals held \nthat “because the Federal Defendants not only exceeded their delegated authority, \nbut also violated an express constitutional prohibition designed to protect individual \nliberties,”—the Appropriations Clause— “Sierra Club has a constitutional cause of \naction  here.”  App.  31a.  This  conclusion  flowed  from  this  Court’s  guidance that \n“certain structural provisions give rise to causes of action.” App. 26a. \n12 \n \n\nThe court  further  held  that  an equitable  ultra  vires  cause  of  action  was \navailable, in line with a long tradition of such equitable review. App. 31a–36a. The \ncourt observed that “[e]quitable actions to enjoin ultra vires official conduct do not \ndepend upon the availability of a statutory cause of action; instead, they seek a ‘judge-\nmade remedy’ for injuries stemming from unauthorized government conduct, and \nthey  rest  on  the  historic  availability  of  equitable  review.”  App.  32a  (quoting \nArmstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc.), 575 U.S. 320, 327 (2015)).  Relying on \ndecades of decisions from the D.C. Circuit and this Court, the court found that “[s]uch \ncauses of action have been traditionally available in American courts.”  App. 32a \n(citing Dart v. United States, 848 F.2d 217, 223 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (“When Congress \nlimits  its  delegation  of  power,  courts  infer  (unless  the  statute  clearly  directs \notherwise)  that  Congress  expects  this  limitation  to  be  judicially  enforced.”)). \nFollowing the D.C. Circuit, the court rejected the arguments that the APA displaced \ntraditional equitable review, and that Plaintiffs were required to satisfy the zone of \ninterests of Section 8005 in challenging wall construction that Congress refused to \nfund. App. 36a–40a.  \nFinally, the court of appeals found that the district court did not abuse its \ndiscretion in granting an injunction against Defendants’  construction.  It rejected \nDefendants’ argument “that Sierra Club will not be irreparably harmed because its \nmembers have plenty of other space to enjoy.” App. 41a. And it found that the balance \nof equities and public interest favored enforcement of Congress’s “calculated choice to \nfund  only one  segment of  border  barrier.”  App.  42a. “No  matter  how  great the \n13 \n \n\ncollateral  benefits  of  building  a  border  wall  may  be,  the  transfer  of  funds  for \nconstruction remains unlawful.”  App. 42a. Moreover, unlike in Winter v. Natural \nResources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 32 (2008), Defendants failed to produce \nany evidence of the benefits of border wall construction. App. 44a. “The Executive \nBranch’s failure to show, in concrete terms, that the public interest favors a border \nwall is particularly significant given that Congress determined fencing to be a lower \nbudgetary priority and the Department of Justice’s own data points to a contrary \nconclusion.” App. 44a–45a. \nIn dissent, Judge Collins “agreed that at least the Sierra Club has established \nArticle  III standing,”  but “conclude[d]  that  the transfers  were  lawful”  and that \nPlaintiffs “lack[ed] any cause of action” to challenge them. App. 47a. \nSeveral related district court decisions have also issued since the stay order. \nThe decisions concern numerous aspects of Defendants’ wall-building plan, including \nthe additional diversion of $3.6 billion in military construction funds under claimed \nSection 2808 authority that Defendants undertook after the stay order. Three of the \nfour decisions reached the merits and found that aggrandizing wall construction with \nbillions of military dollars is unlawful; the fourth denied a motion to dismiss and \nfound that an ultra vires claim was available to challenge wall construction under \nclaimed Section 8005 authority.  \nOn October 11, 2019, in a case brought by El Paso County and a community \norganization in the Western  District  of  Texas, Senior Judge Briones found that \nDefendants’ efforts to spend billions of military dollars on wall construction violates \n14 \n \n\nCongress’s decision to limit the scope and location of wall construction in enacting the \nCAA. See El Paso County v. Trump, 408 F. Supp. 3d 840, 857 (W.D. Tex. 2019). The \ncourt noted its agreement with the district court in this matter that “when a plaintiff \nseeks equitable relief against a defendant for exceeding its statutory authority, the \nzone-of-interests test is inapposite.” Id. at 856 n.1 (citing Sierra Club v. Trump, 379 \nF.Supp.3d 883, 910 (N.D. Cal. 2019)). Due to this Court’s stay order, the district court \nfound claims regarding Section 284 “unviable” and limited its holding to Section 2808. \nId. at 846. In a subsequent order the court therefore enjoined the use of military \nconstruction funds under § 2808 but declined to “issue an injunction regarding the \n§ 284 projects that would effectively override the Supreme Court’s order.” El Paso \nCounty, Texas v. Trump, 407 F. Supp. 3d 655, 661 (W.D. Tex. 2019). The Fifth Circuit \nstayed the injunction, explaining that “among other reasons” there was a “substantial \nlikelihood that Appellees lack Article III standing.” El Paso Cty. v. Trump, No. 19-\n51144, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 567 (5th Cir. Jan. 8, 2020).2 \nOn December 11, 2019, the district court in this action entered a permanent \ninjunction against Defendants’ construction of 175 miles of additional border wall \nsections through diversion of $3.6 billion in military construction funds. The district \ncourt “decline[d] to interpret Section 2808 to provide the Secretary of Defense with \nalmost limitless  authority to use billions of dollars of its appropriations  to build \n                                                                 \n2 This concern is irrelevant here: as the court of appeals noted, “[t]he Federal \nDefendants do not challenge Sierra Club’s Article III standing in these appeals,” \nApp. 17a n.9, and the dissent agreed that Plaintiffs here have standing, App. 47a. \n \n15 \n \n\nprojects for the benefit of DHS, even when Congress specifically declined to give DHS \nitself the funds to build those projects.” California v. Trump, 407 F. Supp. 3d 869, 897 \n(N.D.  Cal. 2019) (citing Util. Air Regulatory Grp.,  573 U.S.  302, 324 (2014) (“We \nexpect Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency decisions of vast \neconomic and political significance.” (quotation omitted))). The district court stayed \nthe injunction pending appeal, noting that “the Supreme Court’s stay of this Court’s \nprior injunction order appears to reflect the conclusion of a majority of that Court \nthat the challenged construction should be permitted to proceed pending resolution \nof the merits.” Id. at 907. \nOn February 27, 2020, in a case brought by the State of Washington in the \nWestern District of Washington, Judge Rothstein found that Defendants did not have \nauthority to use Section 2808 to aggrandize border wall funding beyond the $1.375 \nbillion that Congress appropriated for that purpose. See State v. Trump, --- F.Supp.3d \n---, No. 2:19-CV-01502-BJR, 2020 WL 949934 (W.D. Wash. Feb. 27, 2020). The court \nfound that Congress “saw fit to limit funding for border barrier construction to $1.37 \nbillion all  in accordance  with  its  exclusive spending  power,”  and that  the  CAA \n“explicitly prohibits the Trump Administration from circumventing Congress, and \ninstead requires that any increased funding for the border wall come through an \nappropriations act. Id. at *8–10. The court observed that “Congress repeatedly and \ndeliberately declined to appropriate  the full funds  the President requested for a \nborder wall along the southern border of the United States,” and cautioned that, “[a]s \nJustice Field wrote more than a century ago, a court cannot shut its ‘eyes to matters \n16 \n \n\nof public notoriety and general cognizance. When we take our seats on the bench we \nare not struck with blindness, and forbidden to know as judges what we see as men.’” \nId. at *13 (quoting Ho Ah Kow v. Nunan, 12 F. Cas. 252, 255 (C.C.D. Cal. 1879)).  \nFinally, on April 2, 2020, Judge McFadden of the district court for the District \nof Columbia refused to dismiss ultra vires claims brought by environmental plaintiffs \nwho “plausibly allege[d] that Defendants used § 8005 to fund border wall construction \nand that Congress denied funds  for this border wall  project.”  Ctr. for  Biological \nDiversity v. Trump, –- F.Supp.3d ---, No. 1:19-CV-00408 (TNM), 2020 WL 1643657, \nat *26 (D.D.C. Apr. 2, 2020). Although the court sustained the ultra vires cause of \naction, it found that a constitutional cause of action was unavailable. See id. at *28. \nD. Factual developments since the Court’s stay \nIn the year that this Court’s stay has been in place, Plaintiffs have sought at \nevery turn to expedite the litigation. Meanwhile,  the Defendants  have sought to \nexpedite construction of the wall. At the same time, in response to the COVID-19 \npandemic, this Court has extended the time for filing a petition for certiorari to 150 \ndays. As a result, the Defendants now concede that they will be able to build the \nentirety of the wall in dispute before they have to file a petition for certiorari.   \nDue to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, this Court extended the deadline to \nfile petitions for writs  of certiorari to 150 days from the date of the lower  court \njudgment or order denying a timely petition for rehearing. See Order of March 19, \n2020. The earliest a petition for certiorari would therefore be due is November 23, \n2020. Even if Plaintiffs waive their brief in opposition,  the petition could not be \n17 \n \n\nconferenced before December 4, 2020. Should Defendants file a petition for rehearing \nin the court of appeals, the current deadline extension means that their petition for \ncertiorari need not be filed in time for any conference this year. \nIn the time that has elapsed since the Court stayed the injunction a year ago, \nDefendants have already completed several of the projects enjoined as unlawful by \nthe District  Court—El Centro 1 and Yuma 1 & 2. See Border Wall System, U.S. \nCustoms  and  Border  Protection,  https://www.cbp.gov/border-security/along-us-\nborders/border-wall-system.  As  to  the  remaining  projects,  according  to  CBP, \nDefendants have completed just under 2/3 of the Tucson Border Wall System Project, \nand will complete the project by the end of 2020. See Border-Wall Project Could Block \nSan  Pedro  River,  Public  News  Service  (July  8,  2020), \nhttps://www.publicnewsservice.org/2020-07-08/environment/border-wall-project-\ncould-block-san-pedro-river/a70787-1.  On  July  15,  CBP’s  Public  Lands  Liaison \ninformed the Sierra Club that Defendants had completed more than half of the El \nPaso 1 project, and that it would be complete by the end of 2020. In short, if the stay \nremains in place, Defendants will complete the entire wall before they even need to \nfile a petition for certiorari with this Court. \nThese projects have already had significant consequences for both the natural \nlandscape  as  well  as  archaeological  and  tribal  sites,  and  will  cause  additional \ndestruction unless the stay is lifted. The National Park Service warned that border \nwall construction at Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, a UNESCO biosphere \nreserve in Arizona’s Sonoran Desert, could damage or destroy 22 archaeological sites. \n18 \n \n\nBorder Fence Construction Could Destroy Archaeological Sites, National Park Service \nFinds, Wash. Post (Sept. 17, 2019), https://wapo.st/39eD5dr. Defendants have already \nblasted through parts of Monument Hill, which includes a burial site for the Tohono \nO’odham  Nation,  a  resting  place  for  primarily  Apache  warriors.  Sacred  Native \nAmerican Burial Sites are Being Blown Up for Trump’s Border Wall, Lawmaker Says, \nWash.  Post  (Feb.  9,  2020),  https://wapo.st/30y6efV.  Elsewhere,  Defendants  have \nbegun construction across Arizona’s San Pedro River, the last free-flowing stream in \nthe Sonoran Desert, Border-Wall Project Could Block San Pedro River, Public News \nService  (July  8,  2020),  https://www.publicnewsservice.org/2020-07-\n08/environment/border-wall-project-could-block-san-pedro-river/a70787-1. \nARGUMENT \n The Court should vacate its order staying the injunction because intervening \nevents have made clear that unless the stay is lifted, Defendants will complete the \nwall that is the subject of this litigation before their petition for certiorari is due. \nAccordingly, Defendants will effectively prevail on the merits, even though every court \nto assess the legality of Defendants’ actions has found them unauthorized. A stay \nshould preserve the status quo, not grant the losing party a complete victory without \nappeal. \nPlaintiffs have done everything in their power to enable expeditious review, \nincluding  seeking  speedy  entry  of  partial  summary  judgment  and  securing  an \nexpedited briefing and argument schedule from  the court of appeals.  They have \nsucceeded before the lower courts, including two separate appellate panels. But the \n19 \n \n\ncombination  of  this  Court’s  extended  filing  deadlines  and  Defendants’  rush  to \ncomplete the wall  now  threatens to deny the possibility of redress  for Plaintiffs’ \nclaims.  Defendants  plan  to  complete  the  wall  before  they  would  have  to  seek \ncertiorari. At that point, they need not even file a petition for certiorari, as they will \nhave effectively prevailed. Should the stay remain in place, it  therefore will  “be \ntantamount to a decision on the merits in favor of the applicants.”  Nat’l Socialist \nParty  of  Am.  v.  Village  of  Skokie,  434  U.S.  1327,  1328  (1977)  (Stevens,  J.,  in \nchambers). That is manifestly not the purpose of a stay.   \nAt  the  same  time,  numerous  intervening decisions  lend  substantial  new \nsupport  to  the  district  court’s  injunction.  These  decisions  confirm  both  that \nDefendants’ plan to spend billions of military dollars on a border wall is unlawful, \nand that a cause of action exists for Plaintiffs to seek redress for their injuries. Under \nthese extraordinary circumstances, the Court should lift its stay.   \nI.  IF THE STAY CONTINUES, DEFENDANTS WILL COMPLETE THEIR \nUNLAWFUL PROJECT WHILE EVADING THIS COURT’S REVIEW. \n \nAt this point, leaving the stay in place will not preserve the status quo; to the \ncontrary, Defendants will prevail on the merits without ever getting a single court to \nrule in their favor. At the same time, their actions will inflict irreparable injury on \nthe Plaintiffs, and irreversible damage to the lands in question.  Cf. San Diegans For \nMt. Soledad Nat. War Mem’l v. Paulson, 548 U.S. 1301, 1303 (2006) (Kennedy, J., in \nchambers) (granting stay to “preserv[e] the status quo,” because “[c]ompared to the \nirreparable harm of altering the memorial and removing the cross, the harm in a brief \ndelay  pending the  Court of  Appeals’  expedited  consideration  of  the  case  seems \n20 \n \n\nslight”). A stay should be just that: a stay. Not a victory for the party that has lost \nbefore every court that has adjudicated the wall’s legality.   \nThis  Court’s  extension  of  filing  deadlines  in  response  to  the  COVID-19 \npandemic means that Defendants need not file a petition for certiorari in time for the \nCourt’s consideration in 2020. At the same time, exploiting the stay, Defendants have \nexpedited  wall  construction.  In  the  words  of  Acting  CBP  Commissioner  Mark \nMorgan, “This pandemic has not slowed the construction of the border wall system. \nIn fact, we’re increasing the pace of construction.” Border Wall Construction Has Sped \nUp  Amid  Coronavirus  Crisis,  CBP  Chief  Says,  Fox  News  (May  14,  2020), \nhttps://www.foxnews.com/politics/border-wall-construction-has-sped-up-amid-\ncoronavirus. As a result, by Defendants’ own estimates, every wall section at issue in \nthe injunction will be complete by the end of 2020.  \nAlthough some  of  Plaintiffs’  injuries  can be reversed  by taking down  the \nunlawful  construction,  much  of  the  damage  Defendants  are  inflicting  on  the \nborderlands  will  be  beyond  repair.  In their  rush  to  construct  the  border  wall, \nDefendants are destroying protected saguaro cacti that can take 100 years to reach \nmaturity, and “according to tribal leaders of the Tohono O’odham Nation who live on \nboth sides of the border, [are] blasting ancient burial sites and siphoning an aquifer \nthat feeds a desert oasis where human beings have slaked their thirst for 16,000 \nyears.” Tribal Nation Condemns ‘Desecration’ to Build Border Wall, N.Y. Times (Feb. \n26, 2020), https://nyti.ms/32zcqHb. Defendants have dispensed with protections used \nin the past, rendering their actions even more destructive and irreparable: \n21 \n \n\nDuring  construction  of  a  section  of  border  wall  in  2008,  the  Bush \nadministration  trucked in water  for construction use instead  of extracting \nwater from the aquifer feeding the Quitobaquito spring. \n. . . \nNow  workers  at  the  site  are  pumping  water  from  the  aquifer  beneath \nQuitobaquito to mix cement and to water down dirt roads around construction \nsites. That could endanger not just the spring’s existence but species in its \nwaters such as the Quitobaquito pupfish and Sonoyta mud turtle, according to \nthe National Park Service. \n \nId. Defendants’ destructive approach to the wall project shifts the equities towards \nreinstating the district  court’s injunction, because when  environmental injury is \n“sufficiently likely, . . . the balance of harms will usually favor the issuance of an \ninjunction to protect the environment.” Amoco Prod. Co. v. Village of Gambell, Alaska, \n480 U.S. 531, 545 (1987). \n At  the  same  time,  Defendants’  asserted  justification  for  a  stay  has \nsubstantially weakened. One of their chief arguments in applying for the stay was \nthat DoD would permanently lose access to the funds at issue in the Section 8005 \ninjunction if that injunction was not stayed pending appeal. See, e.g., Defs.’ Reply in \nSupp. of Stay Appl. 15, Trump v. Sierra Club, No. 19A60 (S. Ct. July 22, 2019) \n(asserting that “declining to stay the injunction could well be tantamount to a decision \non the merits in favor of respondents, at least in part” because DoD would be unable \nto obligate the challenged funds even if it prevailed). Defendants have now obligated \n100% of the $2.5 billion at stake in this appeal; lifting the stay would not bar the \nobligation of funds, but would prevent Defendants from completing construction, and \ninflicting permanent and irreversible damage, before the Court has an opportunity to \nconsider the merits of the case. \n22 \n \n\nAs to the remaining equities Defendants raised in their application, those have \nproven insubstantial. As the court of appeals found, “[t]he Executive Branch’s failure \nto show, in concrete terms, that the public interest favors a border wall is particularly \nsignificant given that Congress determined fencing to be a lower budgetary priority \nand the Department of Justice’s own data points to a contrary conclusion.” App. 44a–\n45a.  Since  this  Court’s  grant  of  a  stay,  multiple  courts  have  now  found  that \nDefendants are acting in circumvention of Congress’s funding decisions—and not a \nsingle  court has ruled  otherwise.  As  the court  of appeals  recognized,  the public \ninterest therefore favors enforcement of Congress’s “calculated choice to fund only \none segment of border barrier.” App. 42a; see Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, \n343 U.S. 579, 609–10 (Frankfurter, J., concurring) (“When Congress itself has struck \nthe balance, has defined the weight to be given the competing interests, a court of \nequity is not justified in ignoring that pronouncement under the guise of exercising \nequitable discretion.”). \nMost important, neither the public interest nor the balance of equities support \nallowing Defendants to achieve full relief on the merits by leaving an emergency stay \nin place for more than a year, while expediting their construction to complete the wall \nbefore this Court can consider its legality. What the Court initially entered as interim \nrelief to permit considered review, will now accomplish the opposite. It threatens to \nboth operate as “justice on the fly” and to convert any subsequent proceeding on \ncertiorari into “what may be an ‘idle ceremony.’” Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 427 \n23 \n \n\n(2009) (quoting Scripps–Howard Radio, Inc. v. FCC, 316 U.S. 4, 10 (1942)). The stay \nshould therefore be lifted. \nII.  EVERY COURT TO CONSIDER THE QUESTION HAS FOUND THAT \nDEFENDANTS’ PLAN TO CIRCUMVENT CONGRESS IS UNLAWFUL, \nAND THAT JUDICIAL REVIEW IS AVAILABLE. \n \nIn the  time since  the Court granted Defendants’  stay application,  several \ncourts have considered the legality of wall construction in excess of the $1.375 billion \nthat Congress provided for in the CAA, and the viability of a cause of action to \nchallenge it. Every one has come to the conclusion that Defendants are acting without \nany authority to spend billions of taxpayer dollars on a border wall,  and that an \nequitable cause of action is available to address Defendants’ lawless action.  \nA. Plaintiffs Have a Cause of Action. \n \nThe court of appeals correctly found that Plaintiffs can proceed in equity to \nseek relief from ultra vires and unconstitutional actions by executive officers. “Where, \nas  here,  Congress  could  not  more  clearly  and  emphatically  have withheld  the \nauthority exercised by DoD, with full consciousness of what it was doing and in the \nlight of  much  recent  history,  and Sierra  Club satisfies  the rigors  of  Article  III \nstanding, our obligation to hear and decide this case is virtually unflagging.” App. \n26a (quoting Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 602 (Frankfurter, J. concurring) and Sprint \nCommc’ns, Inc. v. Jacobs, 571 U.S. 69, 77 (2013) (citations, quotations, and alteration \nmarks omitted)). In addition to the recent court of appeals ruling, several intervening \ndecisions since this Court’s stay order confirm that Plaintiffs may call on the courts \nfor protection from Defendants’ ultra vires attempts to circumvent Congress.  \n24 \n \n\nAs  a  recent  Seventh  Circuit  decision  makes  clear,  separation-of-powers \nconcerns rooted in congressional control over spending do not dissipate whenever the \nexecutive branch invokes an inapplicable statutory authority. In City of Chicago v. \nBarr, that court rejected the executive branch’s broad claims of statutory spending \nauthority, which fell “far astray from the language, context and structure  of the \nstatute itself,” and “would raise potential constitutional and statutory concerns.” 961 \nF.3d 882, 906 (7th Cir. 2020). Writing for the court, Judge Rovner concluded that \n“[r]ather than an exercise of authority granted to it by the legislature,” the challenged \nactions were “an executive usurpation of the power of the purse.” Id. at 931. Altering \nthe label did not alter the substance of the interest at stake: “Whether deemed a \nstatutory or a constitutional violation, the executive’s usurpation of the legislature’s \npower of the purse implicates an interest that is fundamental to our government and \nessential  to  the protection  against tyranny.” Id. at  919. Thus,  even though the \nexecutive branch invoked a statute as justification for its actions, the court concluded \nthat “the Attorney General exceeded the authority delegated by Congress” and this \ndecision “violated the constitutional principle of separation of power.” Id. at 931. This \naccords with the conclusion of the court of appeals that Plaintiffs have a cause of \naction because “the Federal Defendants not only exceeded their delegated authority, \nbut also violated an express constitutional prohibition designed to protect individual \nliberties[.]” App. 31a. \nThis Court also recently reaffirmed that parties who can trace their injuries to \na separation of powers violation are entitled to call on the courts for protection. As \n25 \n \n\nthe Court reiterated,  “we  have found it sufficient  that the challenger ‘sustain[s] \ninjury’ from an executive act that allegedly exceeds the official’s authority.” Seila Law \nLLC v. Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau, No. 19-7, 2020 WL 3492641, at *8 (U.S. June 29, \n2020) (quoting Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 721 (1986)). The Court’s decision \nconfirms  its  prior  determination  in  Free  Enterprise  Fund  v.  Public  Company \nAccounting  Oversight  Board  that  such  claims  are  viable.  In  that  case,  “[t]he \nGovernment assert[ed] that ‘petitioners have not pointed to any case in which this \nCourt  has  recognized  an  implied  private  right  of  action  directly  under  the \nConstitution to challenge governmental action under the Appointments Clause or \nseparation-of  powers  principles.’”  561 U.S.  477, 491 n.2 (2010) (quoting Brief for \nUnited States at 22, Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. 477 (2010) (No. 08–861)). But, as the \nCourt observed, private plaintiffs are entitled to such “relief as a general matter[.]” \nId. (citing Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 684 (1946) (“[I]t is established practice for this \nCourt to sustain the jurisdiction of federal courts to issue injunctions to protect rights \nsafeguarded by the Constitution”)); see also Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., \n575 U.S. 320, 327 (2015) (“The ability to sue to enjoin unconstitutional actions by \nstate and federal officers is the creation of courts of equity, and reflects a long history \nof judicial review of illegal executive action, tracing back to England.”); accord App. \n29a (“Where plaintiffs, like Sierra Club, establish that they satisfy the requirements \nof Article III standing, they may invoke separation-of-powers  constraints, like the \nAppropriations  Clause,  to  challenge  agency spending  in excess  of  its  delegated \nauthority.”)  \n26 \n \n\nRecent decisions from the district courts likewise recognize the viability of an \nultra vires claim to challenge border wall construction, and confirm Judge Bork’s \nobservation that it does not make sense to ask whether a plaintiff is within the zone \nof interests of a statute claimed to be inapplicable. See Haitian Refugee Ctr. v. Gracey, \n809 F.2d 794, 811 n.14 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (“Otherwise,  a meritorious litigant, injured \nby ultra vires action, would seldom have standing to sue since the litigant’s interest \nnormally  will  not  fall  within  the  zone  of  interests  of  the  very  statutory  or \nconstitutional provision that he claims does not authorize action concerning that \ninterest.”);  accord  App.  38a  n.14  (“[T]he  relevant  limitation  here  is  not  the \ninapplicable statutory power invoked by the Executive—Section 8005—but instead \nthe restriction on unlawful action—the Appropriations Clause.”). As a court in the \nDistrict of Columbia reasoned: \nIf the Government were to use a Medicare statute, for example, to justify \nbuilding the border wall on someone’s property, it would make little sense \nto require that person to show  that he was  a Medicare  beneficiary or \nprovider to argue that the Medicare statute did not permit border barrier \nconstruction.  \n \nCtr. for Biological Diversity, 2020 WL 1643657, at *25. Additional intervening district \ncourt decisions in Washington and Texas are in agreement. See State v. Trump, 2020 \nWL 949934, at *15 (“The Court concludes that the zone-of-interests  test does not \napply to Plaintiff's challenge to Defendants’ reliance on § 2808.”); El Paso County, 408 \nF. Supp. 3d at 856 n. 1 (agreeing that “the zone-of-interests test is inapposite” to ultra \nvires claims). These decisions all accord with longstanding D.C. Circuit recognition of \nthe ongoing viability of ultra vires review. As Judge Silberman explained for that \n27 \n \n\ncourt, the “enactment of the APA . . . does not repeal the review of ultra vires action \nrecognized long before,” and “[w]hen an executive acts ultra vires, courts are normally \navailable to reestablish the limits on his authority.” Chamber of Commerce v. Reich, \n74 F.3d 1322, 1328 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (citation omitted).  \nBut even if this Court were to hold for the first time that a statutory zone of \ninterests limited the availability of an ultra vires or separation-of-powers  challenge, \nthe court of appeals decision in the companion case demonstrates that Plaintiffs—\nwhose  interests  range  from  nearby  property  ownership  to  aesthetic  and \nenvironmental interests in using the land—are at least arguably within that zone. \nSee Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. \n209, 225 (2012) (“[W]e have always conspicuously included the word ‘arguably’ in the \ntest to indicate that the benefit of any doubt goes to the plaintiff.”). In the companion \ncase, the court of appeals joined the D.C. Circuit in recognizing the expansive scope \nof congressional interest  in enforcing statutes  aimed at tightening congressional \ncontrol over executive spending: “The field of suitable challengers must be construed \nbroadly in this context because, although Section 8005’s obligations were intended to \nprotect Congress, restrictions on congressional standing make it difficult for Congress \nto enforce  these obligations itself.”  App.  115a; accord Scheduled Airlines  Traffic \nOffices,  Inc. v. Dep’t of Def.,  87 F.3d 1356, 1360-61 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (holding that \nstatute that did not seek to “benefit anything other than the public fisc and Congress’s \nappropriation power” was  enforceable by private plaintiff because “we run no risk \nthat the outcome could in fact thwart the congressional goal” (citation and alteration \n28 \n \n\nmarks  omitted)).  Like  the  landowner  in  Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish,  therefore, \nlandowners  and other users of land are suitable challengers to enforce limits  on \npredicate administrative steps that lead directly to the alteration of land. Plaintiffs’ \n“stake  in opposing” the circumvention of Congress’s protection  of the lands they \ntreasure is  “intense and obvious,” and passes  the “zone-of-interests  test[,  which] \nweeds  out litigants who  lack a sufficient interest in the controversy.” Patchak v. \nSalazar, 632 F.3d 702, 707 (D.C. Cir. 2011), aff’d sub nom, Match-E-Be-Nash-She-\nWish, 567 U.S. 209. \nThis  Court  has  never  before  held  that  individuals  facing  injury  due  to \nunauthorized and unconstitutional government action should be shut out of court in \nthe absence of Congress’s clear displacement of courts’ traditional equitable powers. \nPlaintiffs’  members  own  neighboring property.  They fish,  hike,  study,  use,  and \nconserve the lands threatened by construction. They all face injuries traceable to \nDefendants’  disregard  for  Congress’s  control  over  appropriations.  Defendants’ \nposition is that effectively no injured party can challenge their diversion of billions of \ndollars  that  Congress  appropriated  for  other  purposes,  no  matter  how  clearly \nunauthorized. But in the absence of any indication that Congress intended to prohibit \njudicial examination of the executive action here, Defendants’ efforts to circumvent \ncongressional  control  over  appropriations  are the  proper  subject  of  this  Court’s \nreview. See Mach Mining, LLC v. EEOC, 575 U.S. 480, 486 (2015) (“Congress rarely \nintends to prevent courts from enforcing its directives to federal agencies.”); White \nStallion Energy Ctr. v. EPA, 748 F.3d 1222, 1269 (2014) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring \n29 \n \n\nin part and dissenting in part) (observing that under this Court’s “capacious view of \nthe zone of  interests  requirement,” a “suit  should be allowed  unless  the statute \nevinces discernible congressional intent to preclude review”).  \nB. Defendants have no authority to reconfigure the nation’s budget to \ncircumvent Congress’s power of the purse. \n \nAs  every court  to  examine  the  question  has found,  no  authority permits \nDefendants  to funnel billions of dollars to a wall  that Congress refused to fund. \nSection 8005, by its terms, cannot be used to aggrandize the funding for “items” that \nhave been “denied by the Congress.” And as the lower courts recognized, Congress \ndenied the President’s request to fund any wall construction outside of Texas, and did \nnot authorize the spending of billions of taxpayer dollars on the wall sections at issue \nhere.  The  court  of  appeals  therefore  correctly  held  that  “Congress’s  broad  and \nresounding  denial  resulting  in  a  35-day  partial  government  shutdown  must \nconstitute a previous denial for purposes of Section 8005.” App. 129a; see also App. \n232a (“The reality is that Congress was presented with—and declined to grant—a \n$5.7 billion request for border barrier construction.”); Sierra Club v. Trump, 929 F.3d \nat 691 (“Construing section 8005 with an eye towards the ordinary and common-sense \nmeaning of ‘denied,’  real-world events in the months and years leading up to the 2019 \nappropriations  bills  leave  no  doubt  that  Congress  considered  and  denied \nappropriations for the border barrier construction projects that DoD now seeks to \nfinance using its section 8005 authority.”).  \nThe  longest  partial  government  shutdown  in  U.S.  history  ended  with \nCongress’s decision, “in a transparent process subject to great public scrutiny,” to \n30 \n \n\ndeny the administration’s request to construct hundreds of miles of wall outside of \nTexas. Sierra Club, 929 F.3d at 692. “To call that anything but a ‘denial’ is not \ncredible.” Id. The President has himself confirmed what the record makes obvious: \nCongress refused to fund the very wall construction that Defendants are nonetheless \npursuing. As the President conceded on September 18, 2019, the diversion of military \nfunds was entirely occasioned by Congress’s refusal to accede to his funding demands: \n“We wanted Congress to help us. It would have made life very easy. And we still want \nthem to get rid of loopholes, but we’ve done it a different way. . . We still want them \nto do it because it would be a little bit easier, but Congress wouldn’t do it.” Remarks \nby  President  Trump  During  Visit  to  the  Border  Wall,  White  House, \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-visit-\nborder-wall-san-diego-ca/ (Sept. 18, 2019).  \nFaced with this record, “to hold that Congress did not previously deny the \nExecutive Branch’s request for funding to construct a border wall would be to ‘find \nsecreted  in the interstices  of legislation the very grant of power  which Congress \nconsciously withheld.’” App. 129a (quoting Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 609 (Frankfurter, \nJ., concurring)); see also Dep’t of Commerce v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2575 (2019) \n(“[T]his Court is ‘not required to exhibit a naiveté from which ordinary citizens are \nfree.’”  (quoting United  States v.  Stanchich,  550 F.2d  1294,  1300 (2d  Cir.  1977) \n(Friendly, C.J.))).  In short: “‘No’ means no.” App. 129a. \nBut even if Congress’s denial was insufficiently clear, Defendants additionally \nlack authority because border wall construction is not an “unforeseen” military need, \n31 \n \n\nas  Section  8005  requires.  The  court  of  appeals  correctly  rejected  Defendants’ \nargument that “unforeseen” should be equated with “unknown,” because “‘Congress’ \nchoice of words is presumed to be deliberate’ and deserving of judicial respect.’” App. \n123a (quoting SAS Inst., Inc. v. Iancu, 138 S. Ct. 1348, 1355 (2018)). In line with its \nordinary  meaning,  the  “unforeseen”  requirement  has  been  met  in  the  past  by \n“unanticipated circumstances (such as hurricane and typhoon damage to military \nbases) justifying a departure from the scope of spending previously authorized by \nCongress.” App. 233a. As the court of appeals found, such circumstances are a far cry \nfrom the years-long border wall project Defendants repeatedly requested funding for \nand are now pursuing over Congress’s objection. Neither the “longstanding problem” \nof drug smuggling “nor the President’s  purported solution”—a border wall—“was \nunanticipated or unexpected here.” App. 120a.  \nThe  record  establishes  that  the  asserted  concern  about  drugs  was  not \n“unforeseen.” In February 2018, the President specifically claimed to Congress in his \nbudget proposal that “$18 billion to fund the border wall” was necessary because “a \nborder wall is critical to combating the scourge of drug addiction.” Fiscal Year 2019 \nBudget Request 16, Dist. Ct. ECF No. 168-2, Ex. 10 (RJN); see also App. 233a (“[T]hat \nthe need for  the requested  border  barrier construction  funding was  ‘unforeseen’ \ncannot logically be squared with the Administration’s multiple requests for funding \nfor exactly that purpose dating back to at least early 2018.”). And even if “unforeseen” \ncould be interpreted as referring only to DoD’s participation in the wall project, rather \nthan to the general “requirement” of a wall to combat drugs, the administration’s \n32 \n \n\narguments are belied by the record:  DoD  was  specifically  considering the use of \nSection 284 to construct sections of a border wall long before the actions at issue here. \nApp. 122a–123a.  \nMoreover,  it  is  implausible  that  Congress  intended its  own  denial of  the \npresident’s funding request to constitute “unforeseen” circumstances. If that were the \ncase, as the district court observed, agencies could evade any strictures Congress \nimposed on their funding simply by virtue of the timing of the request: “As here, DHS \ncould wait and see whether Congress granted a requested appropriation, then turn \nto DoD if Congress declined, and DoD could always characterize the resulting request \nas raising an ‘unforeseen’ requirement because it did not come earlier.” App. 238a. \nThis  “heads-I-win-tails-you-lose”  theory  would  upend  the  statute  and  the \nconstitutional requirement that Congress authorize spending. Defendants’ position—\nthat a Section 284 request is foreseen only at the moment it is received by DoD— \n“would  swallow  the rule and undermine Congress’s constitutional appropriations \npower,”  and  is  “inconsistent  with  the  purpose  of  Section  8005:  to  ‘tighten \ncongressional control of the reprogramming process.’” App. 122a (quoting H.R. Rep. \nNo. 93-662, at 16 (1973)). \nFinally, the court of  appeals correctly determined  that DoD’s  authority to \nprovide limited support to civilian agencies, when Congress so appropriates, does not \nconvert a civilian law enforcement request into a “military requirement” justifying a \nSection 8005 transfer. There is no dispute that the construction of barriers at issue \nhere is a civilian project, and that DoD is here providing support to the civilian law-\n33 \n \n\nenforcement agency. The court explained that “a request for this support without \nconnection to any military function fails to rise to the level of a military requirement \nfor  purposes  of  Section 8005.”  App.  127a. “To conclude that  supporting  projects \nunconnected to any military purpose or installation satisfies the meaning of ‘military \nrequirement’ would effectively write the term out of Section 8005.” App. 128a. If the \nexecutive branch can convert any action taken for the benefit of another agency into \na “military requirement” simply by having DoD take the action, the statutory phrase \nwould impose no restriction at all. Such a reading violates the “presumption that \nstatutory language is not superfluous.” McDonnell v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 2355, \n2369 (2016) (quotation marks and citation omitted). \nIn sum, the court of appeals’ decision, issued subsequent to this Court’s stay, \nis plainly correct that Section 8005 does not provide an end run around Congress’s \njudgment. Congress considered  and rejected Defendants’  request for  border wall \nfunding.  The  “fundamental  and  comprehensive  purpose”  of  the  Appropriations \nClause “is to assure that public funds will be spent according to the letter of the \ndifficult judgments reached by Congress as to the common good . . . .” Office of Pers. \nMgmt. v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414, 427–28 (1990). A multibillion-dollar raid on DoD’s \nbudget is no substitute for the appropriations process. Defendants lack any authority \nfor their actions.  \n   \n34 \n \n\nCONCLUSION \nThe stay should be lifted. \n              Respectfully submitted, \n               /s/ Dror Ladin          \nSanjay Narayan   Dror Ladin \nGloria D.

On February 15, 2019, President Donald Trump invoked his authority under the \n3  National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. §§ 1601–1651, to declare a national emergency and divert \n4  billions of dollars appropriated for other purposes to carry out his campaign promise to build a wall \n5  along the U.S.-Mexico border.  \n6  2.  The President’s declaration was made solely out of disagreement with Congress’s \n7  decision about the proper funding level, location, and timetable for constructing a border wall. On \n8  the same day that President Trump signed his declaration, he also signed an act of Congress \n9  appropriating only $1.375 billion for the border wall. The law Congress passed not only denied the \n10  President the additional billions he had demanded, but also imposed substantial restrictions on the \n11  location and timing of border wall construction.  \n12  3.  In announcing his declaration of a national emergency, the President stated, “I don’t \n13  need to do this,” but explained that he preferred to build the border wall faster than Congress’s \n14  appropriation would allow. \n15  4.  The President’s declaration plainly states that the invocation of an emergency is to \n16  address a “long-standing” problem of “large-scale unlawful migration through the southern border” \n17  and the President’s opinion that the number of families seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border \n18  presents an “emergency.” In fact, there was and is no national emergency to justify the President’s \n19  action, only his disagreement with Congress’s duly enacted decisions on the extent and pace of \n20  spending on the border wall. \n21  5.  On its face, the declaration does not meet the requirements of the statutory \n22  authorization that the President invokes, 10 U.S.C. § 2808. That law, duly enacted by Congress, \n23  provides that the President may declare an emergency to deploy military construction funds “that are \n24  necessary to support such [emergency] use of the armed forces.” The declaration does not set forth \n25  any actual emergency, any use of the armed forces required to address such an emergency, or how a \n26  diversion of military construction funds is necessary to support the use of the armed forces of the \n27  United States. The President has also instructed his subordinates to divert additional sources of \n28 \n \n1 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: 4:19-cv-00892-HSG \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 26   Filed 03/18/19   Page 4 of 40\n1  Departments of Defense and Treasury funds that Congress restricted for other purposes, in an effort \n2  to secure the appropriations that Congress denied him for the border wall.  \n3  6.  Neither a declaration of emergency nor the Defense and Treasury funding statutes the \n4  administration has invoked permit the President to disregard Congress’s enacted appropriations \n5  legislation. The President’s actions violate both those statutes and the Constitution. \n6  7.  Plaintiffs Sierra Club and Southern Border Communities Coalition are harmed by the \n7  President’s unlawful declaration of a national emergency and bring this action seeking declaratory \n8  and injunctive relief and other remedies as set forth below. \n9  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n10  8.  This case arises under the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019, Pub. Law No. \n11  116-6; Article I, section 9, clause 7 of the U.S. Constitution; Article I, section 7 of the U.S. \n12  Constitution; the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. § 4332; the Administrative \n13  Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701–706, and other acts of Congress. This Court has subject matter \n14  jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 (federal question), 1361 (mandamus), 1651 (All Writs Act) and \n15  2201 (declaratory relief). \n16  9.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1) because the defendants are agencies of \n17  the United States and officers of the United States acting in their official capacity and (1) at least one \n18  plaintiff resides in this district; and/or (2) a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to \n19  the claims occurred in this district.  \n20  10.  In addition to the harm caused to Plaintiff Sierra Club described below, the \n21  challenged action will have an impact throughout the Northern District of California, including in \n22  Contra Costa County and Monterey County, where the Department of Defense maintains several \n23  bases and facilities. The challenged action jeopardizes millions of dollars of Department of Defense \n24  funding for constructions projects at military bases in this District. \n25  PARTIES \n26  11.  Plaintiff Sierra Club is incorporated in the State of California as a nonprofit public \n27  benefit corporation with headquarters in Oakland, California. Sierra Club is a national organization \n28  with 67 chapters and more than 825,000 members dedicated to exploring, enjoying, and protecting \n \n2 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: 4:19-cv-00892-HSG \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 26   Filed 03/18/19   Page 5 of 40\n1  the wild places of the earth; to educating and enlisting humanity to protect and restore the quality of \n2  the natural and human environment; and to using all lawful means to carry out these objectives. \n3  Many of Sierra Club’s members reside, work, recreate, and/or enjoy areas along the border of the \n4  United States and Mexico. Sierra Club has more than 400,000 members in California, over 9,700 of \n5  whom belong to its San Diego Chapter. Sierra Club’s Grand Canyon Chapter, which covers the State \n6  of Arizona, has more than 16,000 members. Sierra Club’s Rio Grande Chapter includes over 10,000 \n7  members in New Mexico and West Texas. Sierra Club’s Lone Star Chapter, which covers the State \n8  of Texas, has more than 26,100 members, more than 440 of whom live in the Lower Rio Grande \n9  Valley.  \n10  12.  Sierra Club’s nationwide advocacy includes educating and mobilizing the public on \n11  issues of habitat destruction, divided local communities, land use, and myriad other human and \n12  environmental impacts associated with border wall construction activities. Sierra Club is committed \n13  to the protection of threatened and endangered species that inhabit the areas surrounding the \n14  proposed border walls as well as their habitat. Sierra Club has been actively involved in protecting \n15  habitat along the southern border for many years, including work to promote conservation on state, \n16  federal, and private lands along and adjacent to the border, and its members regularly use and enjoy \n17  areas along the border. Sierra Club members live near and regularly visit the California-Mexico \n18  border around San Diego for hiking, birdwatching, photography, and other recreational and aesthetic \n19  uses, and have worked to promote conservation of wildlife and habitat along the border.  \n20  13.  Sierra Club brings this action on its own behalf and on behalf of its members. Sierra \n21  Club members live near and frequently visit the parks, refuges, and other public lands along the \n22  United States-Mexico border for hiking, birdwatching, photography and other professional, \n23  scientific, recreational, and aesthetic uses. Among the areas visited by Sierra Club members are: the \n24  Tijuana Estuary (California), the Otay Mountain Wilderness (California), the Jacumba Wilderness \n25  Area (California), the Sonoran Desert (Arizona), Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge (Arizona), \n26  the Chihuahan Desert (New Mexico), Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge (Texas), the Lower Rio \n27  Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge (Texas), Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park (Texas), La \n28  Lomita Historical Park (Texas), and the National Butterfly Center (Texas). Sierra Club members \n \n3 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: 4:19-cv-00892-HSG \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 26   Filed 03/18/19   Page 6 of 40\n1  also reside, work, and recreate in and around cities and towns affected by the border wall, including \n2  but not limited to Santa Teresa, New Mexico; San Ysidro and Imperial Beach, California; Roma, \n3  Texas; Rio Grande City, Texas; Escobares, Texas; La Grulla, Texas; and Salineño, Texas. \n4  14.  Sierra Club’s members obtain recreational, professional, scientific, educational, and \n5  aesthetic benefits from their activities in these areas, and from wildlife dependent upon habitat that \n6  includes these areas. Sierra Club and its members have been and will continue to be injured by the \n7  construction of a border wall and related infrastructure. Such injuries are particularly significant \n8  because the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is proceeding with border work without first \n9  complying with decades-old environmental and public safety laws and regulations that were enacted \n10  for the very purpose of protecting the places, species, and values Sierra Club members work to \n11  protect. The requested relief will redress these injuries. \n12  15.  Sierra Club has devoted and continues to devote substantial resources to advocacy \n13  opposing the Department of Homeland Security’s border wall construction, intended to avoid the \n14  injuries to Sierra Club’s interests described above. Those efforts include formation of Sierra Club \n15  Borderlands, a coalition intended to investigate the environmental and social impacts of the border \n16  wall, and educate the public regarding those impacts. Sierra Club also devoted substantial staff and \n17  other resources towards legislative advocacy leading up to the appropriations bill passed by \n18  Congress in February 2019, specifically directed towards securing Congress’s denial of substantial \n19  funding to the border wall. Because of President Trump’s emergency declaration, Sierra Club has \n20  been forced to redirect resources to continue and amplify its advocacy—despite Congress’s decision \n21  to limit funding for near-term construction. For example, Sierra Club has allocated staff and \n22  volunteers within its national headquarters in Oakland to support veterans who intend to travel to \n23  Texas to oppose continued wall construction. As a result of the President’s emergency declaration, \n24  Sierra Club has also redirected staff and volunteers within its California offices to investigate and \n25  assess the extent of construction activities along the border in those areas outside those delineated by \n26  congressional appropriations, and the impacts of those activities.  \n27  16.  Plaintiff Southern Border Communities Coalition (“SBCC”) is a program of Alliance \n28  San Diego, a nonprofit public benefit corporation with headquarters in San Diego, California. SBCC \n \n4 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: 4:19-cv-00892-HSG \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 26   Filed 03/18/19   Page 7 of 40\n1  brings together 60 organizations from California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas to promote \n2  policies and solutions that improve quality of life in border communities, including fair border \n3  enforcement policies that respect human dignity and human rights and prevent loss of life, as well as \n4  rational and humane immigration-reform policies affecting the border region. Additionally, SBCC \n5  engages in oversight of U.S. Customs and Border Protection and its components, including Border \n6  Patrol, and advocates for accountability and transparency in the government policies and practices \n7  that impact border communities.  \n8  17.  SBCC brings this action on behalf of its members and on its own behalf. SBCC’s \n9  members live in and around the border lands impacted by the President’s declaration of a national \n10  emergency, in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. They recreate in and derive other \n11  benefits from public lands, including areas for which border barrier funding has not been \n12  appropriated or for which the deployment of funds has been prohibited. The ongoing and imminent \n13  construction of border infrastructure, including the border wall and fencing, will restrict members’ \n14  access to these and other lands, degrading their quality of life. It has additional negative \n15  consequences: dividing and fragmenting the communities in which SBCC members live; dividing \n16  the binational character of these communities by increasing members’ fears about traveling back-\n17  and-forth across the border; heightening racial division and promoting hostility towards immigrants \n18  and communities of color in border communities; and decreasing eco- and other forms of tourism \n19  that generate significant revenue.  \n20  18.  President Trump’s declaration also exposes SBCC’s membership to heightened risk \n21  from flooding, as well as risks to clean water, clean air and other natural resources. These threats are \n22  magnified by the government’s refusal to comply with constitutional and statutory limits on \n23  construction. The border wall directly harms members economically, culturally, recreationally, \n24  aesthetically, and religiously. The requested relief would redress these injuries. \n25  19.  Further, the declaration of a national emergency and the improper diversion of funds \n26  has already and will continue to impair SBCC’s mission and divert SBCC’s resources. SBCC has \n27  mobilized its staff and its affiliates to monitor and respond to the diversion of funds and the \n28  construction caused by and accompanying the national emergency declaration. It has organized, \n \n5 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: 4:19-cv-00892-HSG \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 26   Filed 03/18/19   Page 8 of 40\n1  supported, or participated in grassroots advocacy to respond to ongoing and imminent construction \n2  throughout the border lands, including in San Diego, Tucson, Las Cruces, El Paso, and the Rio \n3  Grande Valley, and will continue to do so in response to new construction caused by the President’s \n4  declaration. SBCC has responded locally and nationally to the President’s declaration to highlight \n5  the impacts it will have on border communities. It has engaged in rapid-response political outreach \n6  and advocacy, including traveling to Washington, D.C., to educate legislators about the perils to \n7  border communities of the construction caused by and accompanying the national emergency \n8  declaration. It has responded to several calls from local officials, communities of faith, members of \n9  Congress and congressional staff, and the public about the President’s national emergency \n10  declaration and the impacts it will have on the border lands and on border communities. In doing so, \n11  it has provided information, guidance, and support to organizations and individuals that depend on \n12  SBCC, and has led tours for groups requesting to see for themselves the “national emergency” that \n13  has been proclaimed. Since the President’s declaration of emergency, these activities have consumed \n14  the majority of SBCC staff’s time, thereby interfering with SBCC’s core advocacy regarding border \n15  militarization, Border Patrol law-enforcement activities, and immigration reform. SBCC must take \n16  these actions in furtherance of its mission to protect and improve the quality of life in border \n17  communities. \n18  20.  Defendant DONALD J. TRUMP is the President of the United States, and is sued in \n19  his official capacity. \n20  21.  Defendant PATRICK M. SHANAHAN, Acting Secretary of Defense, is sued in his \n21  official capacity. Acting Secretary Shanahan is responsible for ensuring that Department of Defense \n22  actions comply with applicable laws. Acting Secretary Shanahan is responsible for carrying out the \n23  diversion of military construction funds for the construction of the border wall under President \n24  Trump’s declaration of national emergency. \n25  22.

Defendant STEVEN MNUCHIN, Secretary of the Treasury, is sued in his official \n4  capacity. Secretary Mnuchin is responsible for carrying out the diversion of Treasury funds for the \n5  construction of the border wall under President Trump’s declaration of national emergency. \n6   \n7  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n8  24.  On February 15, 2019, President Trump declared a national emergency in order to \n9  secure funding for his border wall. The President’s declaration came after a weeks-long stalemate \n10  between the President and Congress, during which the President repeatedly threatened to declare a \n11  national emergency if Congress did not fund the construction of the border wall to the extent and at \n12  the pace the President preferred. \n13  25.  Contrary to the appropriations bills duly enacted by Congress for construction of \n14  border barriers, which included specific limitations and “carve-out” areas, President Trump has \n15  repeatedly stated that he will build a “big, beautiful” 1,000 mile-long wall along the U.S.-Mexico \n16  border.  \n17  26.  Congress’s latest appropriation for the border wall—enacted specifically in response \n18  to the President’s call for action to end an impasse that included a six-week government shutdown—\n19  included only $1.375 billion. In announcing his declaration of national emergency, however, \n20  President Trump expressly disagreed with Congress’s appropriation decision and instead called for \n21  more than $8 billion for border wall construction. \n \n22   \nPresident Trump Has Repeatedly Failed to Secure from Congress his Desired Level of \n23  Appropriations for Wall Construction. \n24  27.  Since taking office in 2017, President Trump and his executive branch officials have \n25  sought appropriations to fund construction of the border wall. In its repeated appropriation requests, \n26  the Trump administration has acknowledged that it cannot build a border wall without congressional \n27  authorization.  \n28 \n \n7 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: 4:19-cv-00892-HSG \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 26   Filed 03/18/19   Page 10 of 40\n1  28.  In March 2017, the President asked Congress for $1.4 billion for the border wall for \n2  the remainder of fiscal year 2017, and an additional $2.6 billion for fiscal year 2018. On May 1, \n3  2017, Congress agreed on a bipartisan bill to fund the government through September 30, 2017. \n4  Congress rejected the President’s request for wall funding, but increased spending on border security \n5  by $1.5 billion. Three days after tweeting that the country “needs a good ‘shutdown’ in September,” \n6  the President signed the bill on May 5, 2017. \n7  29.  On March 23, 2018, Congress rejected the President’s request for $1.6 billion to build \n8  a border wall in the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas. Congress instead allocated $1.6 billion for \n9  border security including new technology and repairs to existing barriers, as well as $641 million for \n10  about 33 miles of new fencing that had been authorized by the Secure Fence Act of 2006, Public \n11  Law 109–367.  \n12  30.  Congress did not accede to the President’s requests for more border wall funding \n13  throughout the remainder of 2018.  \n14   \n \n15 \nPresident Trump Refuses to Sign a Congressional Appropriations Package that Does Not \nInclude his Desired Amount of Border Wall Funding and Threatens to Declare a National \n16 \nEmergency. \n17  31.  On December 11, 2018, during his latest round of budget negotiations with Congress, \n18  the President announced that he would be “proud” to shut down the government if he did not receive \n19  his requested $5.7 billion in wall funding. When it was clear that both chambers of Congress would \n20  pass funding legislation necessary to keep the federal government open, President Trump declared \n21  that he would not sign any funding legislation—including legislation unanimously approved by the \n22  Senate to keep the government funded through February 8, 2019—without $5 billion to build his \n23  proposed border wall. \n24  32.  On December 21, 2018, the United States entered into a partial government \n25  shutdown. The shutdown would last 35 days, making it the longest in the nation’s history. President \n26  Trump threatened to draw the shutdown out for “a very long period of time—months or even \n27  years”—unless Congress gave him the money he was demanding for the border wall. \n28 \n \n8 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: 4:19-cv-00892-HSG \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 26   Filed 03/18/19   Page 11 of 40\n1  33.  On January 6, 2019, the Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget \n2  communicated to the congressional Committees on Appropriation that “[t]he President requests $5.7 \n3  billion for construction of a steel barrier for the Southwest border,” which would “fund construction \n4  of a total of approximately 234 miles of new physical barrier and fully fund the top 10 priorities in \n5  CBP’s Border Security Improvement Plan.” The letter stated that “a physical barrier—wall—creates \n6  an enduring capability that helps field personnel stop, slow down, and/or contain illegal entries.” \n7  34.  Frustrated by Congress’s consistent rejection of his demand for funding, President \n8  Trump threatened to declare a national emergency and build a wall without congressional approval. \n9  According to the President, he could “call a national emergency and build it very quickly.” \n10  35.  For several weeks, President Trump repeated his threat to invoke a national \n11  emergency to circumvent Congress’s funding authority. On January 9, 2019, he stated that “I have \n12  an absolute right to do national emergency if I want,” and revealed that his “threshold” for invoking \n13  the emergency would be if he “can’t make a deal with people that are unreasonable.” \n14  36.  On January 10, 2019, the President referred to ongoing negotiations with the House \n15  and the Senate and said “If this doesn’t work out, probably I will [declare a national emergency]. I \n16  would almost say definitely.” He explained that “[i]f we don’t make a deal, I would say 100 percent, \n17  but I don’t want to say 100 percent,” and that “[i]f we don’t make a deal, I would say it would be \n18  very surprising to me that I would not declare a national emergency and just fund it through the \n19  various mechanisms.” \n20  37.  Despite encouragement from Senate Republicans to agree to reopen the government \n21  for a short period to negotiate with Democrats, President Trump promised to remain steadfast in his \n22  demands for a wall along the United States-Mexico border. He would not declare a national \n23  emergency “so fast,” he said, because, although “[i]t’s the easy way out, . . . Congress should do it.” \n24  38.  As the shutdown ground on, President Trump attempted to strike a compromise. He \n25  announced on January 19, 2019, that he was willing to temporarily extend the Deferred Action for \n26  Childhood Arrivals and Temporary Protected Status programs in exchange for $5.7 billion for a \n27  border wall. Democratic leaders rejected the proposal as a “non-starter” that merely put forth \n28 \n \n9 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: 4:19-cv-00892-HSG \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 26   Filed 03/18/19   Page 12 of 40\n1  previously rejected offers. They urged the President to open the government before beginning \n2  negotiations over border security. \n3  39.  On January 25, 2019, faced with worsening national gridlock as a result of the 35-day \n4  shutdown, President Trump agreed to sign legislation that would keep the government open until \n5  February 15, 2019. This stopgap legislation did not include any funding for a border wall and had \n6  previously been rejected by the President.  \n7  40.  In ending the government shutdown, the President stated that if he were unable to \n8  “work with the Democrats and negotiate,” then “obviously we’ll do the emergency because that’s \n9  what it is. It’s a national emergency.” \n10  41.  After the shutdown ended, a bipartisan committee of negotiators from the House and \n11  Senate began work on a compromise appropriations bill that would include some funding for border \n12  security. President Trump publicly expressed his skepticism that negotiations would be fruitful, \n13  declaring that the negotiators were “wasting their time” and that he would “get [the wall] built one \n14  way or the other.” \n15  42.  On January 31, 2019, President Trump stated that “we’ve set the stage for what’s \n16  going to happen on February 15 if a deal is not made.” The next day, he said “I think there’s a good \n17  chance that we’ll have to do” an emergency proclamation.  \n18  43.  As House and Senate negotiators deliberated over a deal to avert another government \n19  shutdown, Trump administration officials started laying the groundwork for a possible national \n20  emergency declaration. Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney stated that “[w]e’ll take \n21  as much money as [Congress] can give us and then we’ll go off and find the money someplace \n22  else…but [the wall] is going to get built with or without Congress.”  \n23  44.  On February 11, 2019, congressional negotiators finalized a funding deal. The \n24  agreement included $1.375 billion for fencing and other physical barriers along 55 miles of the U.S.-\n25  Mexico border and included numerous restrictions on the timing and location of construction.  \n26  45.  President Trump stated that he was “not happy” with Congress’s compromise deal \n27  and would find “other methods” to finance a wall without explicit approval form Congress.  \n \n28 \n \n   \n10 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: 4:19-cv-00892-HSG \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 26   Filed 03/18/19   Page 13 of 40\nCongress Considered and Specifically Rejected the President’s Wall Funding Demands in \n1  Enacting the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019. \n2  46.  On February 14, 2019, Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of \n3  2019. \n4  47.  Congress’s enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019 occurred \n5  against a backdrop of its consideration and rejection of the President’s $5.7 billion border wall \n6  demand. On December 20, 2018, the House of Representatives had passed a continuing resolution \n7  that met the President’s request for $5.7 billion in border wall funding. The Senate did not pass the \n8  same legislation. When both houses of Congress came to an agreement and enacted the Consolidated \n9  Appropriations Act of 2019, they elected to exclude the President’s requested $5.7 billion in wall \n10  funds. \n11  48.  The House Appropriations Committee Chair, Representative Nita Lowey, confirmed \n12  that congressional negotiators considered, and “frankly, . . . denie[d] the President billions of dollars \n13  in funding for the concrete wall that he demanded.” Senator Patrick Leahy, Vice Chairman of the \n14  Senate Appropriations Committee, who was actively involved in negotiations on the 2019 \n15  Consolidated Appropriations Act, stated “[t]he agreement does not fund President Trump’s wasteful \n16  wall.” 165 Cong. Rec. S1362 (daily ed. Feb 14, 2019). \n17  49.  Congress’s appropriations judgment, as expressed in the law that passed both \n18  chambers, is that only $1.375 billion should be used to construct a border wall, and that such a wall \n19  must be limited geographically to the Rio Grande Valley Sector. The bill provided only a fraction of \n20  the $5.7 billion that the President demanded for the border wall, allocating $1.375 billion for roughly \n21  55 miles of pedestrian fencing in the Rio Grande Valley Sector of the southern border. The \n22  appropriations act includes numerous carve-outs that prevent wall construction in parks and wildlife \n23  areas, and requires the approval of local officials and a public comment period before initiating \n24  construction in cities situated along the border. \n25  50.  Congress specifically prohibited the use of any appropriated funds in specific sections \n26  of the Rio Grande Valley, forbidding the use of any funds to construct a barrier “(1) within the Santa \n27  Ana Wildlife Refuge; (2) within the Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park; (3) within La Lomita \n28  Historical Park; (4) within the National Butterfly Center; or (5) within or east of the Vista del Mar \n \n11 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: 4:19-cv-00892-HSG \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 26   Filed 03/18/19   Page 14 of 40\n1  Ranch tract of the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge.” Pub. Law No. 116-6, \n2  Division A § 231. \n3  51.  In addition, Congress forbade the use of appropriated funds for construction within \n4  the city limits of Roma, Texas; Rio Grande City, Texas; Escobares, Texas; La Grulla, Texas; and \n5  within Salineño, Texas, until local elected officials and the public have had an opportunity to \n6  comment on any plans for construction. Pub. Law No. 116-6, Division A § 232. \n7  52.  Finally, Congress imposed a prohibition on the use of any appropriated funds to \n8  “increase . . . funding for a program, project, or activity as proposed in the President’s budget request \n9  for a fiscal year until such proposed change is subsequently enacted in an appropriation Act . . . .” \n10  Pub. Law No. 116-6, Division D § 739. The only exception to this prohibition is for changes “made \n11  pursuant to the reprogramming or transfer provisions of this or any other appropriations Act.” \n \n12   \nPresident Trump Declares a National Emergency, Instructing his Secretaries of Defense and \n13  Homeland Security to Construct his Wall in the Absence of Congressional Authorization. \n14  53.  President Trump stated that he would sign the appropriations bill and simultaneously \n15  declare a national emergency. According to the President, $1.375 billion from Congress is “not so \n16  much” for a border wall and the emergency declaration would allow him to supplement what \n17  Congress has authorized “[s]o we have a chance of getting close to $8 billion [and] . . . build a lot of \n18  wall.” \n19  54.  On February 15, 2019, President Trump declared a national emergency in order to \n20  secure his preferred level of funding for his border wall. See “Presidential Proclamation on \n21  Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Southern Border of the United States” (“the \n22  Proclamation”).  \n23  55.  In announcing his declaration of national emergency, President Trump stated that he \n24  decided to declare an emergency because he was dissatisfied with the pace of Congress’s spending. \n25  The President acknowledged that he “went through Congress . . . made a deal . . . got almost $1.4 \n26  billion” and was “successful, in that sense.” But, he explained, “I want to do it faster. I could do the \n27  wall over a longer period of time. I didn’t need to do this, but I’d rather do it much faster.” \n28 \n \n12 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: 4:19-cv-00892-HSG \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 26   Filed 03/18/19   Page 15 of 40\n1  56.  While admitting that the appropriations bill provided him with a substantial amount \n2  of border wall funding, the President declared that he was still “not happy with it” because “on the \n3  wall, [Congress] skimped.”  \n4  57.  The President also expressed his disdain for Congress’s decision to include carve-out \n5  areas where wall construction is prohibited, and emphasized the importance of a contiguous wall. \n6  “The only weakness is they [individuals crossing the southern border] go to a wall and then they go \n7  around the wall. They go around the wall and in . . . . They go through areas where you have no \n8  wall.” \n9  58.  The President’s senior policy advisor, Stephen Miller, confirmed that emergency and \n10  supplemental funding would allow for the construction of “hundreds of miles” of border wall by \n11  September 2020—much faster than congressionally authorized funding would allow. \n12  59.  In describing the nature of the purported national emergency, the text of the \n13  Proclamation (attached and incorporated herein as Exhibit A) refers to a “long-standing” problem of \n14  “large-scale unlawful migration through the southern border” that has “worsened” in recent years \n15  due to “sharp increases in the number of family units entering and seeking entry to the United States \n16  and an inability to provide detention space” for them. It further states that these family units “are \n17  often released into the country and are often difficult to remove from the United States because they \n18  fail to appear for hearings, do not comply with orders of removal, or are otherwise difficult to \n19  locate.” \n20  60.  The Proclamation states that “[b]ecause of the gravity of the current emergency \n21  situation, it is necessary for the Armed Forces to provide additional support to address the crisis.” \n22  The Proclamation further states “that this emergency requires use of the Armed Forces and, in \n23  accordance with section 301 of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. § 1631), that the \n24  construction authority provided in section 2808 of title 10, United States Code, is invoked and made \n25  available, according to its terms, to the Secretary of Defense.”  \n26  61.  The Proclamation directs the Secretary of Defense, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. § 2808, to \n27  order members of the Ready Reserve to “assist and support the activities of the Secretary of \n28  Homeland Security at the southern border” and orders the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland \n \n13 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: 4:19-cv-00892-HSG \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 26   Filed 03/18/19   Page 16 of 40\n1  Security, “if necessary,” to take action for “transfer and acceptance of jurisdiction over border \n2  lands.”  \n3  62.  According to a “fact sheet” issued by the White House, entitled “President Donald J. \n4  Trump’s Border Security Victory,” the President has identified $3.6 billion to be reallocated from \n5  Department of Defense military construction projects pursuant to 10 U.S.C. § 2808, $601 million to \n6  be reallocated from the Treasure Forfeiture Fund, and $2.5 billion to be reallocated from Department \n7  of Defense funds for counterdrug activities. The use of such funds was duly limited by Congress to \n8  specific purposes pursuant to its authority under the Constitution.  \n9  63.  The President intends to spend approximately $8.1 billion for construction of the \n10  border wall, many times the $1.375 billion appropriated by Congress. \n11  64.  The President’s unlawful reallocation of military construction funds will jeopardize \n12  construction projects at military bases and sites across the country, including in this District and \n13  throughout California.  \n14   \nCongress Passes an Unprecedented Disapproval Resolution of the President’s Emergency \n15 \nDeclaration. \n16 \n65.  The National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. §§ 1601–1651, sets out a procedure \n17 \nwhereby Congress may terminate the national emergency if a resolution is passed by both houses of \n18 \nCongress and becomes law. 50 U.S.C. § 1622.  \n19 \n66.  Congress had never before passed such a resolution. \n20 \n67.  On February 26, 2019, the House of Representatives passed H.J. Res. 46, voting 245 \n21 \nto 182 to terminate the President’s declaration of emergency.  \n22 \n68.  On March 14, 2019, the Senate likewise passed the disapproval resolution, voting 59 \n23 \nto 41 to terminate the President’s declaration of emergency. \n24 \n69.  Numerous senators explained that their vote was motivated by the President’s \n25 \nusurpation of Congressional power. Senator Lamar Alexander of Texas stated that “[a]ny \n26 \nappreciation for our structure of government means that no president should be able to use the \n27 \nNational Emergencies Act to spend money that Congress refuses to provide.” Senator Pat Toomey of \n28 \nPennsylvania stated, “I don’t think that the focus of the National Emergency Act is to circumvent \n \n14 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: 4:19-cv-00892-HSG \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 26   Filed 03/18/19   Page 17 of 40\n1  what the Congress and the president agreed to.” Senator Mitt Romney of Utah described the \n2  disapproval vote as “a vote for the Constitution and for the balance of powers that is at its core.” \n3  70.  On March 15, 2019, President Trump vetoed the disapproval resolution. \n4   \n5  The Government Initiates the Process of Diverting Funds to Build President Trump’s Wall. \n6  71.  On February 15, 2019, the Department of Treasury notified Congress that it would \n7  transfer $242 million from the Treasury Forfeiture Fund to DHS to support law enforcement border \n8  security efforts conducted by CBP. The notification stated that these funds would be available for \n9  obligation as of March 2, 2019, with the remaining $359 million to be transferred and available for \n10  obligation at a later date. \n11  72.  On February 26, 2019, the White House issued a Fact Sheet entitled “The Funds \n12  Available to Address the National Emergency at Our Border.” The Fact Sheet states that “DOD will \n13  augment existing counterdrug funds by transferring up to $2.5 billion from other DOD accounts” so \n14  as to “direct needed funds to the border” through the FY 2019 Drug Interdiction and Counter-Drug \n15  Activities account. \n16  73.  On March 6, 2019, Secretary Nielsen testified before the House of Representatives’ \n17  Homeland Security Committee that the proposed border wall would involve constructing a “little \n18  more than 700” miles of barriers.  \n19  74.  On March 8, 2019, President Trump wrote on Twitter: “The Wall is being built and is \n20  well under construction. Big impact will be made. Many additional contracts are close to being \n21  signed. Far ahead of schedule despite all of the Democrat Obstruction and Fake News!” \n22  75.  On March 9, 2019, President Trump wrote on Twitter that “Major sections of Wall \n23  are being built” and that “MUCH MORE” would “follow shortly.” \n24  76.  On March 11, 2019, Senators on the Appropriations Committee, and the \n25  Appropriations Subcommittees on Defense and on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs \n26  released a letter stating that “Defense officials informed members of Congress that they are \n27  preparing a transfer of funds into the Drug Interdiction and Counter-Narcotics Activities, Defense \n28 \n \n15 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: 4:19-cv-00892-HSG \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 26   Filed 03/18/19   Page 18 of 40\n1  account. This is necessary because the Department has obligated in excess of 90 percent of the \n2  $881.5 million appropriated for that purpose in fiscal year 2019.” \n3  77.  On March 14, 2019, President Trump wrote on Twitter that “the Wall” is “already \n4  under major construction.”  \n \n5 \nThe President Issues a Fiscal Year 2020 Budget Request Seeking an Increase in Funding for \n6  his Wall Project. \n7  78.  On March 11, 2019, the White House Office of Management and Budget released the \n8  President’s Fiscal Year 2020 Budget Request. \n9  79.  The President states that “finishing the border wall is an urgent national priority,” and \n10  that “[m]y Budget continues to reflect these priorities.” Accordingly, the fiscal year 2020 “Budget \n11  requests $5 billion to construct approximately 200 miles of border wall along the U.S. Southwest \n12  border.” \n13  80.  On March 12, 2019, the Department of Defense released its fiscal year 2020 budget \n14  proposal, which requested “$9.2 billion of emergency funding for unspecified military construction.” \n15  Of that figure, $3.6 billion would be allocated “to build border barriers,” and an additional $3.6 \n16  billion would be used to “backfill funding reallocated in FY 2019 to build border barriers.” \n17   \n18  Construction of President Trump’s Wall Will Have Devastating Effects on the Environment.  \n19  81.  Through the expenditure of diverted funds in 2019, the administration expects to \n20  complete construction of far more of the President’s wall than Congress authorized. This includes \n21  areas for which the Department of Homeland Security plans have been announced, contracts have \n22  been awarded, resources have been mobilized, or waivers have been issued.  \n23  82.  According to the Department of Homeland Security, in 2019 it will commence \n24  construction of 215 new miles of border wall. This construction will occur in ecologically sensitive \n25  habitats and other border lands known for their outstanding hiking, wildlife viewing, photography, \n26  and wilderness values. For example, the Department of Homeland Security has notified the public it \n27  intends to commence wall construction in California’s San Diego and El Centro Sectors; Arizona’s \n28  Yuma Sector; New Mexico’s El Paso Sector; and, Texas’s Laredo and Rio Grande Valley Sectors.  \n \n16 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: 4:19-cv-00892-HSG \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 26   Filed 03/18/19   Page 19 of 40\n1  83.  Examples of the environmental consequences can be seen in California’s San Diego \n2  and El Centro Sectors, where border wall construction would be devastating. Any new wall \n3  construction in these areas would be in or near the Otay Mountain Wilderness Area and the Jacumba \n4  Wilderness Area. These areas are habitat to more than 100 sensitive plant and animal species that are \n5  listed as “endangered,” “threatened,” or “rare” under the federal Endangered Species Act of 1973, 16 \n6  U.S.C. § 1531 et seq., and/or the California Endangered Species Act, Cal. Fish & Game Code § 2050 \n7  et seq. For example, the federally and state-endangered Peninsular Desert Bighorn sheep has a range \n8  that includes mountainous terrain in Mexico near the United States-Mexico border and extends north \n9  across the border through the Jacumba Wilderness to California’s Anza-Borrego State Park.  \n10  84.  Likewise, construction is imminent in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, \n11  notwithstanding Congress’s decision to prevent the Trump administration from building a wall in \n12  five areas nationally recognized for their ecological and recreational value. The administration’s \n13  commitment to construct border walls in the Rio Grande Valley Sector means these areas are \n14  threatened with irreversible damage despite express Congressional direction to preserve them. Initial \n15  construction activities include accessing the project area with heavy equipment, creating and using \n16  staging areas, the conduct of earthwork, excavation, fill, and site preparation, and installation and \n17  upkeep of physical barriers, roads, supporting elements, drainage, erosion controls, safety features, \n18  lighting, cameras, and sensors. As a result of border wall construction, local communities would be \n19  more vulnerable to flooding, divided by border wall infrastructure, and suffer irreparable damage to \n20  cultural, historic, and recreational sites.  \n21  85.  In addition to ongoing and imminent construction, the President’s diversion of funds \n22  not appropriated by Congress to expand and expedite the border wall has injured the Sierra Club and \n23  SBCC. Both organizations have been compelled to respond to the declared emergency to safeguard \n24  their and their members’ interests, including by diverting resources from the organizations’ \n25  campaigns to unveil ongoing and imminent construction, educate their members, and respond to \n26  threats to their organizational missions. Staff and affiliates have participated in grassroots advocacy, \n27  engaged in rapid-response political outreach and advocacy with congressional and local elected \n28  officials, and responded to requests from their members, the public, and elected officials about the \n \n17 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: 4:19-cv-00892-HSG \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 26   Filed 03/18/19   Page 20 of 40\n1  threat and implementation of unlawful expedited construction. The circumvention of legal processes, \n2  lack of transparency, notice, and consultation, have frustrated the organizations’ efforts to work \n3  towards their missions on behalf of their members. \n4  86.  Defendants have not conducted a public review of these activities’ impacts on the \n5  environment and local communities that complies with NEPA.  \n6 \nLEGAL BACKGROUND \n7 \nThe Constitution Vests Congress with Exclusive Authority to Determine the Appropriation of \n8  Public Funds. \n9  87.  The Constitution bans the expenditure of any public funds by any branch of the \n10  federal government, including the Executive Branch, absent enactment of a law appropriating such \n11  funds: “No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by \n12  Law . . . .” U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 7. The Constitution thus vests Congress, and only Congress, \n13  with the power to spend public funds, and it must do so by passing identical appropriations bills in \n14  both the House and the Senate. Public funds may only be expended as specified in such duly enacted \n15  appropriations laws. Except as specifically authorized by Congress, the Executive Branch has no \n16  authority to expend public funds that have not been thus appropriated. \n17  88.  The Appropriations Clause, in Article I, section 9, clause 7 of the Constitution, \n18  provides that “No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations \n19  made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public \n20  Money shall be published from time to time.” \n21  89.  The Appropriations Clause “assure[s] that public funds will be spent according to the \n22  letter of the difficult judgments reached by Congress as to the common good and not according to \n23  the individual favor of Government agents or the individual pleas of litigants.” Office of Pers. Mgmt. \n24  v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414, 428 (1990). \n25  90.  Congress also may enact authorization legislation to establish, continue, or modify an \n26  agency, program, or government function. Congressional authorization of a program, however, does \n27  not confer power on the Executive Branch to expend public funds. Only a specific appropriations \n28  law can do that. \n \n18 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: 4:19-cv-00892-HSG \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 26   Filed 03/18/19   Page 21 of 40\n1  91.  Although Congress may combine an authorization and an appropriation in a single \n2  bill, it may (and most often does) enact them separately. In keeping with its broad constitutional \n3  authority, Congress may choose not to appropriate funds for an authorized program, or Congress \n4  may appropriate a different amount of money than the amount (if any) provided for in an \n5  authorization. Congress also may limit the purposes for which appropriated funds may be used.  \n6  92.  Appropriations laws generally take one of two forms: (a) temporary appropriations, \n7  which typically are enacted on an annual basis, and (b) permanent appropriations, which are few in \n8  number and which (i) remain in effect until Congress repeals or modifies them, and (ii) permit \n9  federal agencies to expend public funds without the need for passage of a temporary appropriations \n10  bill in the current Congress. For an appropriation to be considered permanent, the law must clearly \n11  and expressly so provide.  \n12  93.  By providing funding to the Executive Branch through temporary (typically annual) \n13  appropriations, Congress ensures Executive Branch accountability by forcing the Executive Branch \n14  to return to Congress each year to seek continued funding for authorized agencies, programs, and \n15  government functions. This process provides Congress the opportunity to determine a suitable \n16  amount of funding after careful consideration. \n17  94.  Temporary appropriations also reinforce and further Congress’ constitutional \n18  responsibility to oversee the Executive Branch, and thereby act as a check upon the Executive \n19  Branch, as the Framers intended. \n20   \nThe Constitution Does Not Allow Appropriations to be Made by Executive Fiat, Rather than \n21  By Law. \n22  95.  “It is for Congress, proceeding under the Constitution, to say what amount may be \n23  drawn from the Treasury in pursuance of an appropriation.” Hooe v. United States, 218 U.S. 322, \n24  333 (1910). If the Executive Branch spends money in violation of an appropriation law, “it would be \n25  drawing funds from the Treasury without authorization by statute and thus violating the \n26  Appropriations Clause.” United States v. McIntosh, 833 F.3d 1163, 1175 (9th Cir. 2016). \n27  96.  No statute can provide the President with authority to spend in excess of \n28  congressional limitations, or to draw money from the Treasury by executive declaration in a manner \n \n19 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: 4:19-cv-00892-HSG \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 26   Filed 03/18/19   Page 22 of 40\n1  that contravenes the appropriations that have been made by law. “Any exercise of a power granted \n2  by the Constitution to one of the other branches of Government is limited by a valid reservation of \n3  congressional control over funds in the Treasury.” Office of Pers. Mgmt., 496 U.S. at 425. \n4  97.  Nor can Congress endow the President with the power to reallocate money within the \n5  federal budget by executive emergency declaration. “The Constitution is a compact enduring for \n6  more than our time, and one Congress cannot yield up its own powers, much less those of other \n7  Congresses to follow.” Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. at 452 (Kennedy, J., concurring). \n8   \nThe Constitution’s Presentment Clause Requires that the President Either Approve a Bill or \n9 \nReturn it to Congress with Objections. \n10 \n98.  The Presentment Clause, Article I, Section 7, Clause 2, provides that “[e]very Bill \n11 \nwhich shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a Law, \n12 \nbe presented to the President of the United States: If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall \n13 \nreturn it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the \n14 \nObjections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it.” \n15 \n99.  The President has no constitutional authority to modify the appropriations bills passed \n16 \nby Congress. “There is no provision in the Constitution that authorizes the President to enact, to \n17 \namend, or to repeal statutes.” Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. at 438. This restriction dates \n18 \nback to the founding: “Our first President understood the text of the Presentment Clause as requiring \n19 \nthat he either approve all the parts of a Bill, or reject it in toto.” Id. at 440 (quotation marks omitted). \n20 \n100.  “Where the President does not approve a bill, the plan of the Constitution is to give to \n21 \nthe Congress the opportunity to consider his objections and to pass the bill despite his disapproval.” \n22 \nWright v. United States, 302 U.S. 583, 596 (1938).  \n \n23 \nCongress Has Strictly Restricted the Use of Appropriated Funds for Emergency Military \n24 \nConstruction Authority Under 10 U.S.C. § 2808. \n25 \n101.  Congress imposed binding restrictions on the President’s emergency powers to use \n26 \nmilitary construction funds for non-appropriated projects. Specifically, Congress limited the use of \n27 \nemergency military construction funds only for projects (a) undertaken during a national emergency \n28 \n \n20 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: 4:19-cv-00892-HSG \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 26   Filed 03/18/19   Page 23 of 40\n1  “that requires use of the armed forces,” and (b) that “are necessary to support such use of the armed \n2  forces.” 10 U.S.C. § 2808.  \n3  102.  For purposes of Section 2808, Congress defines the term “military construction” as \n4  including “any construction, development, conversion, or extension or any kind carried out with \n5  respect to a military installation . . . or any acquisition of land or construction of a defense access \n6  road.” Congress defined “military installation” as a “base, camp, post, station, yard, center, or other \n7  activity under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of a military department . . . .” 10 U.S.C. § 2801(a). \n8  103.  The emergency construction authority under 10 U.S.C. § 2808 has been used in the \n9  past only for military construction directly linked to a military installation connected to war efforts \n10  abroad and for protection of weapons of mass destruction.  \n11   \nCongress Has Expressly Restricted the Use of Appropriated Funds for Military Construction \n12 \nof Border Fencing Under 10 U.S.C. § 284. \n13 \n104.  Congress imposed binding restrictions on the Secretary of Defense’s authority to \n14 \nprovide support for construction of border fences. Specifically, Congress authorized the use of \n15 \nDepartment of Defense support only for “[c]onstruction of roads and fences and installation of \n16 \nlighting to block drug smuggling corridors across international boundaries of the United States,” \n17 \nrather than across an entire international border. 10 U.S.C. § 284(b)(7). \n18 \n105.  In addition, Congress blocked the Secretary of Defense from redetermining the \n19 \nfunding balance struck by Congress by requiring that the Secretary of Defense seek reimbursement \n20 \nof support provided by the Department of Defense to other agencies. Accordingly, 10 U.S.C. § 277 \n21 \nprovides that “to the extent otherwise required by section 1535 of title 31 (popularly known as the \n22 \n“Economy Act”) or other applicable law, the Secretary of Defense shall require a civilian law \n23 \nenforcement agency to which support is provided under this chapter to reimburse the Department of \n24 \nDefense for that support.” \n25 \n \n26 \n \n27 \n \n28 \n \n \n \n21 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: 4:19-cv-00892-HSG \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 26   Filed 03/18/19   Page 24 of 40\n \n1  Congress Has Expressly Restricted the Secretary of Defense’s Authority to Transfer or \nReprogram Funds Under Both Section 8005 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act \n2  and 10 U.S.C. § 2214. \n3  106.  Congress has restricted the Secretary of Defense’s reprogramming and transfer \n4  powers to ensure that transfer authorities do not provide an end run around Congress’s role in \n5  determining funding levels. \n6  107.  To transfer funds under Section 8005 of the 2019 Department of Defense \n7  Appropriations Act, Pub. Law No. 115-245, the Secretary of Defense must make a determination \n8  “that such action is necessary in the national interest” and obtain the approval of the Office of \n9  Management and Budget. He must also promptly notify Congress of any such transfer. See also 10 \n10  U.S.C. § 2214(c). \n11  108.  According to its terms, authority to transfer funds pursuant to Section 8005 “may not \n12  be used unless for higher priority items, based on unforeseen military requirements, than those for \n13  which originally appropriated and in no case where the item for which funds are requested has been \n14  denied by the Congress.” \n15  109.  Congress likewise limited the transfer of non-construction Department of Defense \n16  funds in 10 U.S.C § 2214(b) to transfers that (1) “provide funds for a higher priority item, based on \n17  unforeseen military requirements, than the items for which the funds were originally appropriated;” \n18  and (2) are not for “an item for which Congress has denied funds.” \n19   \nCongress Did Not Permit the President to Use the Treasury Forfeiture Fund as an \n20 \nUnrestricted Slush Fund. \n21  110.  Congress established the Department of the Treasury Forfeiture Fund to permit the \n22  use of forfeited funds for specifically delineated law enforcement purposes. See 31 U.S.C. § 9705. \n23  111.  These purposes range from the payment of “compensation to informers,” “payment \n24  for services of experts and consultants needed by a Department of Treasury law enforcement \n25  organization to carry out the organization’s duties relating to seizure and forfeiture,” and similar \n26  expenditures relating to the seizure and forfeiture program. 31 U.S.C § 9705(a). \n27  112.  Congress did not authorize use of the Treasury Forfeiture Fund to pay for \n28  construction of a border wall. \n \n22 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: 4:19-cv-00892-HSG \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 26   Filed 03/18/19   Page 25 of 40\nThe National Environmental Policy Act Requires Agencies to Consider and Make Public the \n1 \nEnvironmental Impact of Their Actions. \n2 \n113.  NEPA is the “basic national charter for protection of the environment.” 40 C.F.R. § \n3 \n1500.1(a) (1978). It was enacted with the ambitious objectives of “encourag[ing] productive and \n4 \nenjoyable harmony between man and his environment . . . to promote efforts which will prevent or \n5 \neliminate damage to the environment and biosphere and stimulating the health and welfare of man; \n6 \nand to enrich the understanding of the ecological systems and natural resources important to the \n7 \nNation . . . .” 42 U.S.C. § 4321. \n8 \n114.  In order to achieve these goals, NEPA contains several “action forcing” procedures, \n9 \nmost significantly the mandate to prepare an environmental impact statement (“EIS”) on major \n10 \nfederal actions “significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.” Robertson v. Methow \n11 \nValley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 348 (1989); 42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C).  \n12 \n115.  The Council on Environmental Quality (“CEQ”) was created to administer NEPA and \n13 \nhas promulgated NEPA regulations, which are binding on all federal agencies. See 42 U.S.C. §§ \n14 \n4342, 4344; 40 C.F.R. §§ 1500–1508 (1978). \n15 \n116.  When a federal agency is not certain whether an EIS is required, it must prepare a \n16 \nbriefer document, known as an environmental assessment (“EA”). 40 C.F.R. § 1508.9 (1978). If the \n17 \nagency concludes in an EA that an action may have significant impacts on the environment, then an \n18 \nEIS must be prepared. Id. § 1501.4. If an EA concludes that there are no significant impacts to the \n19 \nenvironment, the federal agency must provide a detailed statement of reasons why the action’s \n20 \nimpacts are insignificant and issue a Finding of No Significant Impact (“FONSI”). Id. § 1508.13. \n21 \n117.  The Supreme Court has found that the preparation and public circulation of EISs and \n22 \nEAs promotes NEPA’s broad environmental objectives in two primary ways: “It ensures that the \n23 \nagency, in reaching its decision, will have available, and will carefully consider, detailed information \n24 \nconcerning significant environmental impacts; it also guarantees that the relevant information will be \n25 \nmade available to the larger audience that may also play a role in both the decision-making process \n26 \nand the implementation of that decision.” Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. at 349. \n27 \n118.  NEPA requires that “agencies shall integrate the NEPA process with other planning at \n28 \nthe earliest possible time to insure that planning and decisions reflect environmental values, to avoid \n \n23 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: 4:19-cv-00892-HSG \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 26   Filed 03/18/19   Page 26 of 40\n1  delays later in the process, and to head off potential conflicts.” 40 C.F.R. § 1501.2 (1978); id. § \n2  1502.5 (“An agency shall commence preparation of an [EIS] as close as possible to the time the \n3  agency is developing or is presented with a proposal . . . .”). The Ninth Circuit has interpreted these \n4  regulations as requiring the NEPA process to be conducted “before any irreversible and irretrievable \n5  commitment of resources.” Connor v. Burford, 848 F.2d 1441, 1446 (9th Cir. 1998). \n6  119.   A “[p]roposal exists at that stage in the development of an action when an  \n7  agency . . . has a goal and is actively preparing to make a decision on one or more alternative means \n8  of accomplishing that goal and the effects can be meaningfully evaluated.” 40 C.F.R. § 1508.23. \n9  Actions are defined to “include new and continuing activities including projects and programs \n10  entirely or partly financed, assisted, conducted, regulated, or approved by federal agencies,” and \n11  include “[a]pproval of specific projects, such as construction or management activities located in a \n12  defined geographic area,” as well as “actions approved by permit or other regulatory decision as well \n13  as federal and federally assisted activities.” Id. §§ 1508.18(a) & (b)(4). \n14  120.  For activities covering multiple landscape types and jurisdictions, agencies may \n15  prepare a programmatic EIS (“PEIS”). A PEIS evaluates the effects of broad proposals or planning-\n16  level decisions that may include any or all of the following: a wide range of individual actions; \n17  implementation over a long timeframe; and/or implementation across a large geographic area. \n18  121.  The Department of Homeland Security has not promulgated regulations to implement \n19  NEPA, but has issued an Instruction Manual. Instruction Manual 023-01-001-01, Revision 01, \n20  Implementation of NEPA (Nov. 6, 2014) (“DHS NEPA Manual”). The Manual specifically includes \n21  “proposed construction, land use, activity, or operation that has the potential to significantly affect \n22  environmentally sensitive areas” as an action “normally requiring” the preparation of at least an EA. \n23  122.  Echoing the general NEPA requirements regarding the need to conduct NEPA early \n24  in the process, the DHS NEPA Manual directs the Department of Homeland Security to “integrate[] \n25  the NEPA process with other planning efforts at the earliest possible stage so that environmental \n26  factors are considered with sufficient time to have a practical influence on the decision-making \n27  process before decisions are made.” DHS NEPA Manual, at p. IV-1. The Manual directs that agency \n28  components that process applications for Department of Homeland Security funding or approval, \n \n24 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: 4:19-cv-00892-HSG \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 26   Filed 03/18/19   Page 27 of 40\n1  “have a responsibility to integrate NEPA requirements early in the application process,” and to \n2  ensure that “completion of the NEPA process occurs before making a decision to approve” the \n3  proposal. \n4  123.  NEPA requires that the Agencies involve the public in preparing and considering \n5  environmental documents that implement the Act. 40 C.F.R. § 1506.6; id. § 1506.6(b)(1) (requiring \n6  federal agencies to “[p]rovide public notice of NEPA-related hearings, public meetings, and the \n7  availability of environmental documents so as to inform those persons and agencies who may be \n8  interested or affected”). \n9  124.  The CEQ regulations further direct federal agencies to “insure that environmental \n10  information is available to public officials and citizens before decisions are made,” and mandate that \n11  “public scrutiny [is] essential to implementing NEPA.” 40 C.F.R. § 1500.1(b). \n12  125.  In analyzing an action’s environmental effects, an agency must also consider the \n13  effects of both: “connected actions,” meaning those that are “[c]losely related,” including actions \n14  that “[c]annot or will not proceed unless other actions are taken previously or simultaneously,” and \n15  actions that are “interdependent parts of a larger action and depend on the larger action for their \n16  justification”; and “cumulative actions,” meaning those that “when viewed with other proposed \n17  actions have cumulatively significant impacts.” 40 C.F.R. § 1508.25.  \n18  126.  The Ninth Circuit has held that a “complete failure to involve or even inform the \n19  public” about the agency’s preparation of a NEPA document violates the statute’s public \n20  participation requirements. Citizens for Better Forestry v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 341 F.3d 961, 970 \n21  (9th Cir. 2003). \n22  127.  Underlying all of NEPA’s procedural requirements is the mandate that agencies take \n23  a “hard look” at all of the environmental impacts and risks of a proposed action. As stated by the \n24  Ninth Circuit, “general statements about ‘possible effects’ and ‘some risk’ do not constitute a ‘hard \n25  look’ absent a justification regarding why more definitive information could not be provided.” Blue \n26  Mountains Biodiversity Project v. Blackwood, 161 F.3d 1208, 1213 (9th Cir. 1998) (internal citations \n27  omitted). \n28   \n   \n25 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: 4:19-cv-00892-HSG \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 26   Filed 03/18/19   Page 28 of 40\n \n1  Fiscal Law Forbids Mixing and Matching Sources of Funding to Evade Spending Limits. \n2  128.  Congressional appropriations occur against the backdrop of rules and interpretations \n3  established by the General Accountability Office (“GAO”), which guide the executive branch’s use \n4  of appropriated funds. \n5  129.  Among the authorities the GAO interprets are statutes governing the permissible use \n6  of appropriated funds. These statutes include the Anti-Deficiency Act, the Purpose Statute, and the \n7  Transfer Statute. \n8  130.  The Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits spending funds in excess of appropriations, unless \n9  authorized by statute. See 31 U.S.C. § 1341(a)(1)(A) (officers and employees may not “make or \n10  authorize an expenditure or obligation exceeding an amount available in an appropriation or fund for \n11  the expenditure or obligation”). It also prohibits the executive branch from involving the United \n12  States government “in a contract or obligation for the payment of money before an appropriation is \n13  made unless authorized by law.” Id. § 1341(a)(1)(B).  \n14  131.  The Purpose Statute mandates that appropriated funds may be used only for the \n15  purpose of the appropriation, unless authorized by statute. See 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a) (“Appropriations \n16  shall be applied only to the objects for which the appropriations were made except as otherwise \n17  provided by law.”).  \n18  132.  The Transfer Statute prohibits transfer of funds from one account to another, unless \n19  authorized by statute. See 31 U.S.C. § 1532 (“An amount available under law may be withdrawn \n20  from one appropriation account and credited to another or to a working fund only when authorized \n21  by law.”). “Transfers without statutory authority are equally forbidden whether they are (1) transfers \n22  from one agency to another, (2) transfers from one account to another within the same agency, or (3) \n23  transfers to an interagency or intra-agency working fund.” GAO, Principles of Federal \n24  Appropriations Law: Fourth Edition, Chapter 2, GAO-16-464SP, pp. 2-38–2-39. In addition to \n25  violating the Transfer Statute, “an unauthorized transfer would violate 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a) (which \n26  prohibits the use of appropriations for other than their intended purpose), would constitute an \n27  unauthorized augmentation of the receiving appropriation, and could, if the transfer led to \n28 \n \n26 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: 4:19-cv-00892-HSG \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 26   Filed 03/18/19   Page 29 of 40\n1  overobligating the receiving appropriation, result in an Antideficiency Act (31 U.S.C. § 1341) \n2  violation as well.” Id. at 2-38. \n3  133.  Courts frequently give “special weight to [GAO’s] opinions” due to its “accumulated \n4  experience and expertise in the field of government appropriations.” Nevada v. Dep’t of Energy, 400 \n5  F.3d 9, 16 (D.C. Cir. 2005). \n6  134.  Many of the GAO’s rules protect a key function of congressional appropriations \n7  judgment: setting a maximum authorized program level by specifically appropriating a finite set of \n8  funds for a particular project. See SBA’s Imposition of Oversight Review Fees on PLP Lenders, B-\n9  300248 (Comp. Gen. Jan. 15, 2004) (“In addition to providing necessary funds, a congressional \n10  appropriation establishes a maximum authorized program level, meaning that an agency cannot, \n11  absent statutory authorization, operate beyond the level that can be paid for by its appropriations.”).  \n12  “Allowing an agency to exceed this level with funds derived from some other source would usurp \n13  congressional prerogative and undercut the congressional power of the purse.” Availability of \n14  Receipts from Synthetic Fuels Projects for Contract Admin. Expenses of the Dep’t of Treasury, \n15  Office of Synthetic Fuels Projects, B-247644, 72 Comp. Gen. 164, 165 (Apr. 9, 1993). \n16  135.  According to longstanding GAO authority, an agency may not combine multiple \n17  appropriations to complete a project when neither appropriation is sufficient on its own for the \n18  project. See Department of Homeland Security—Use of Management Directorate Appropriations to \n19  Pay Costs of Component Agencies, B-307382 (Comp. Gen. Sept. 5, 2006). An agency cannot “elect \n20  to use (or exhaust) first one and then the other of the two appropriations for the same class of \n21  expenditures.” Id. (citing 10 Comp. Gen. 440, 447 (1931)). \n22  136.  In addition, “specific appropriations preclude the use of general ones even when the \n23  two appropriations come from different accounts.” Nevada, 400 F.3d at 16 (citing 4 Comp. Gen. 476 \n24  (1924)). In other words, where Congress has allocated a specific amount of funding for an activity, \n25  an agency cannot use funding from a more general fund to accomplish the specific goal. \n26  137.  Finally, under the so-called “pick and stick rule,” when two appropriations are \n27  available for the same purpose, the agency must select which to use—and once it has made  \n28 \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: 4:19-cv-00892-HSG \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 26   Filed 03/18/19   Page 30 of 40\n1  an election, the agency may not make use of funds from a different appropriation for the same \n2  purpose, unless the agency, at the beginning of the fiscal year, informs Congress of its intent to \n3  change for the next fiscal year. See Department of Homeland Security—Use of Management \n4  Directorate Appropriations to Pay Costs of Component Agencies, B-307382; see also 68 Comp. \n5  Gen. 337 (1989); 59 Comp.

Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury if Defendants take action to build a wall in \n9  reliance on the Proclamation, or in implementing the President’s direction to use funds pursuant to \n10  10 U.S.C. §§ 284, 2808 and 31 U.S.C § 9705, and Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n11 \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n12 \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n13  (The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019, Pub. Law No. 116-6) \n14  139.  Neither the President nor any other federal official can take an action that exceeds the \n15  scope of their constitutional and/or statutory authority. \n16  140.  Congress has explicitly limited Defendants’ authority to construct a border wall \n17  through exercise of its constitutional appropriations power in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of \n18  2019. Congress’s appropriations judgment is that only $1.375 billion should be used to construct a \n19  border wall, that such a wall must be limited geographically to 55 miles within the Rio Grande \n20  Valley Sector, and that construction of a border wall should not proceed at this time with respect to \n21  numerous areas specifically described in the law.  \n22  141.  Congress enacted the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019 against the backdrop \n23  of the President’s continued demand for $5.7 billion in unrestricted border wall funding for \n24  construction of a contiguous barrier between the United States and Mexico. “Congress has expressed \n25  its will to withhold this power from the President as though it had said so in so many words.” \n26  Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 602 (1952) (Frankfurter, J., concurring). \n27  142.  The President has nonetheless instructed the Secretaries of Homeland Security and \n28  Defense to act beyond the limitations imposed by Congress by spending approximately $8.1 billion \n \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: 4:19-cv-00892-HSG \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 26   Filed 03/18/19   Page 31 of 40\n1  to build a wall across the border, in purported reliance on a patchwork of older, more general statutes \n2  that are silent on wall construction. \n3  143.  The statutes the President purports to rely on, 10 U.S.C. §§ 284, 2808 and 31 U.S.C \n4  § 9705, do not authorize wall construction outside of the limited geographic, monetary, and \n5  scheduling bounds set by Congress in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019. \n6  144.  “[T]he meaning of one statute may be affected by other Acts, particularly where \n7  Congress has spoken subsequently and more specifically to the topic at hand.” F.D.A. v. Brown & \n8  Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 133 (2000). “This is particularly so where the scope of the \n9  earlier statute is broad but the subsequent statutes more specifically address the topic at hand.” Id. at \n10  143. Therefore, “a specific policy embodied in a later . . . statute should control [judicial] \n11  construction of the [earlier broad] statute, even though it ha[s] not been expressly amended.” Id. \n12  (quotations and citations omitted; brackets in original).  \n13  145.  Use of funds under 10 U.S.C. § 2808 in accordance with the President’s Proclamation \n14  to construct the border wall violates the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019. It funds the wall \n15  in excess of the amount established by Congress and it denies funds from other projects that \n16  Congress chose to fund. \n17  146.  The President’s Proclamation does not meet the conditions required for invocation of \n18  10 U.S.C. § 2808 because it does not identify an emergency requiring use of the armed forces.  \n19  147.  The President’s Proclamation additionally does not meet the conditions required for \n20  invocation of 10 U.S.C. § 2808 because construction of a border wall is not a military construction \n21  project supporting the armed forces. \n22  148.  Use of funds under 10 U.S.C. § 284 to construct the border wall violates the \n23  Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019.  \n24  149.  The Department of Defense’s use of funds under 10 U.S.C. § 284 to construct a \n25  contiguous fence across the international boundaries of the United States is contrary to Congress’s \n26  requirement that construction under that statute must be limited to drug smuggling corridors.  \n27  150.  Congress did not delegate to the Secretary of Defense the decision to construct a \n28  contiguous fence across the southern border through a bill providing for military support of law \n \n29 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: 4:19-cv-00892-HSG \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 26   Filed 03/18/19   Page 32 of 40\n1  enforcement activities. Interpretation of statutes “must be guided to a degree by common sense as to \n2  the manner in which Congress is likely to delegate a policy decision of such economic and political \n3  magnitude . . . .” Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. at 133. \n4  151.  In addition, use of funds under 10 U.S.C. § 284 to construct the border wall is \n5  contrary to Congress’s judgment in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019 because funds not \n6  appropriated for wall construction cannot be reimbursed to the Department of Defense under 10 \n7  U.S.C. § 277. \n8  152.  Use of the Treasury Forfeiture Fund under 31 U.S.C. § 9705 to construct the border \n9  wall violates the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019. Congress did not authorize use of the \n10  Treasury Forfeiture Fund to pay for construction of a border wall, and any general authorization for \n11  use of funds in that statute must be interpreted against Congress’s more specific passage of the \n12  Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019.  \n13  153.  In addition, the use of funds in excess of the $1.375 billion authorized in the \n14  Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019 for construction of a border barrier violates Division D, \n15  Section 739 of the Act because it would represent an “increase [in] . . . funding for a program, \n16  project, or activity as proposed in the President’s budget request for a fiscal year” before “such \n17  proposed change is subsequently enacted in an appropriation Act.”  \n18  154.  The President has proposed an increase of funding by several billion dollars in his \n19  budget request for fiscal year 2020, and such proposed change has not been enacted in an \n20  appropriation act.  \n21  155.  The only exception to the Section 739 prohibition on increases in funding is for \n22  increases “made pursuant to the reprogramming or transfer provisions of this or any other \n23  appropriations Act.” Neither 10 U.S.C. § 2808 nor 10 U.S.C. § 284 is an appropriations act, so the \n24  use of either authority to increase funding for the President’s wall construction is prohibited.  \n25  156.  Defendants are acting ultra vires in using funds to construct the border wall beyond \n26  the restrictions Congress imposed in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019.  \n27   \n28   \n \n30 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: 4:19-cv-00892-HSG \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 26   Filed 03/18/19   Page 33 of 40\nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n1 \n(Separation of Powers, Article I, Section 9, Clause 7 of the Constitution) \n2 \n157.

Defendants may not “draw[] [Money] from the Treasury, but in Consequence of \n4 \nAppropriations made by Law.” U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 7.  \n5 \n159.  Congress has explicitly limited Defendants’ authority to construct a border wall \n6 \nthrough exercise of its constitutional appropriations power in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of \n7 \n2019.  \n8 \n160.  The President has nonetheless instructed the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland \n9 \nSecurity to act beyond the limitations imposed by Congress by spending approximately $8.1 billion \n10 \nto build a wall across the border.  \n11 \n161.  “It is one thing to draw an intention of Congress from general language and to say \n12 \nthat Congress would have explicitly written what is inferred, where Congress has not addressed itself \n13 \nto a specific situation. It is quite impossible, however, when Congress did specifically address itself \n14 \nto a problem . . . to find secreted in the interstices of legislation the very grant of power which \n15 \nCongress consciously withheld. To find authority so explicitly withheld is not merely to disregard in \n16 \na particular instance the clear will of Congress. It is to disrespect the whole legislative process and \n17 \nthe constitutional division of authority between President and Congress.” Youngstown, 343 U.S. at \n18 \n609 (Frankfurter, J., concurring). \n19 \n162.  Because the statutes the President purports to rely on, 10 U.S.C. §§ 284, 2808, and 31 \n20 \nU.S.C § 9705, do not authorize wall construction outside of the limited geographic, monetary, and \n21 \nscheduling bounds set by Congress in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019, the use of those \n22 \nstatutes to fund border wall construction usurps Congress’s legislative authority and violates the \n23 \nConstitution’s separation of powers. \n24 \n \n25  THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Appropriations Clause, Article I, Section 9, Clause 7 of the Constitution) \n26 \n163.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n27 \n164.  The Constitution only permits money to be withdrawn from the Treasury by an \n28 \nappropriation made by law. U.S. Const. art.

In the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019, Congress has appropriated only \n2  $1.375 billion for border wall construction.  \n3  166.  The President asserts that he has independent authority under 10 U.S.C. §§ 284 and \n4  2808 and 31 U.S.C § 9705 to order that billions more be spent on the wall than provided in those \n5  legislative appropriations. The President has ordered the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland \n6  Security to implement his determination that additional billions be spent on construction of the \n7  border wall. \n8  167.  Congress cannot give the President the authority to make an appropriation, including \n9  by statutes that provide authority for emergency proclamations.  \n10  168.  Congress cannot give the President authority to contravene restrictions on the use of \n11  Treasury funds for construction of a border wall, contained within an appropriations law that \n12  Congress has passed and the President has signed. \n13  169.  To the extent that 10 U.S.C. §§ 284 and 2808 and 31 U.S.C § 9705 authorize the \n14  President to allocate money from the Department of the Treasury by executive proclamation, rather \n15  than by law, and in contravention of restrictions contained in Congress’s appropriations’ laws, they \n16  violate the Constitution. \n17   \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n18 \n(Presentment Clause, Article I, Section 7, Clause 2) \n19 \n170.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n20 \n171.  The Presentment Clause requires that when Congress passes an appropriations bill, \n21 \nthe President has only two options: he must sign it, or return it with his objections so that Congress \n22 \nmay consider them. \n23 \n172.  Instead of following this mandatory requirement, the President signed a bill to which \n24 \nhe objected, and announced that he would use the National Emergencies Act to reallocate funds to \n25 \nhis liking. \n26 \n173.

To the extent that 10 U.S.C. §§ 284 and 2808 and 31 U.S.C § 9705 authorize the \n4  President to modify or repeal Congress’s appropriations legislation by executive proclamation, rather \n5  than by law, they violate the Constitution. \n \n6 \n \nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n7 \n(National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. § 4332) \n8 \n175.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth herein.  \n9 \n176.  The Secretaries of Defense, Homeland Security, and the Treasury must ensure that \n10 \ntheir agencies prepare an environmental impact statement on major Federal actions “significantly \n11 \naffecting the quality of the human environment,” and prepare an environmental assessment to \n12 \ndetermine whether any such significant effects exist. Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizen Council, \n13 \n490 U.S. 332, 348 (1989); Metcalf v. Daley, 214 F.3d 1135, 1142 (9th Cir. 2000); 42 U.S.C. § \n14 \n4332(2)(C). A federal agency “bears the primary responsibility to ensure that it complies with \n15 \nNEPA.” ’Ilio’Ulaokalani Coal. v. Rumsfeld, 464 F.3d 1083, 1092 (9th Cir. 2006). “When an agency \n16 \ndecides to proceed with an action in the absence of an EA or EIS, the agency must adequately \n17 \nexplain its decision.” Alaska Ctr. for Env’t v. U.S. Forest Serv., 189 F.3d 851, 859 (9th Cir. 1999).  \n18 \n177.   NEPA requires that the Defendants involve the public in preparing and considering \n19 \nenvironmental documents that implement the Act. 40 C.F.R. § 1506.6 (1978); id. § 1506.6(b)(1) \n20 \n(requiring federal agencies to “[p]rovide public notice of NEPA-related hearings, public meetings, \n21 \nand the availability of environmental documents so as to inform those persons and agencies who \n22 \nmay be interested or affected”). \n23 \n178.  Border wall construction is a final agency action, for purposes of the Defendants’ \n24 \nobligations under NEPA. \n25 \n179.  To the extent that the Department of Homeland Security can waive aspects of its own \n26 \ncompliance with NEPA, that authority is absent with respect to the Department of Defense’s use of \n27 \nfunds. Section 8113 of the 2019 Department of Defense Appropriations Act prohibits the payment of \n28 \nsalary to any officer or employee of the Department of Defense who “approves or implements the \n \n33 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: 4:19-cv-00892-HSG \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 26   Filed 03/18/19   Page 36 of 40\n1  transfer of administrative responsibilities or budgetary resources . . . to the jurisdiction of another \n2  Federal agency not financed by this Act without the express authorization of Congress.” The \n3  Department of Defense is obligated to comply with NEPA, and no Defense officer or employee may \n4  transfer to DHS the Department of Defense’s own responsibility to comply with NEPA. \n5  180.  As directed by Defendant Trump’s Proclamation, Defendants Shanahan, Nielsen, and \n6  Mnuchin violate NEPA and NEPA’s implementing regulations by authorizing border wall \n7  construction without first conducting the necessary environmental analysis of the impacts of the \n8  actions in an EA or EIS, or a programmatic EIS, in light of the potentially significant impacts that \n9  the action will have, including both cumulative effects and the effects of connected actions.  \n10  181.  As directed by Defendant Trump’s Proclamation, Defendants Shanahan, Nielsen, and \n11  Mnuchin further violate NEPA and NEPA’s implementing regulations by failing to initiate and \n12  complete NEPA at the earliest possible time in the planning process.  \n13  182.  As directed by Defendant Trump’s Proclamation, Defendants Shanahan, Nielsen, and \n14  Mnuchin have utterly failed and/or refused to involve the public in its decision-making processes for \n15  border construction. This failure to provide for any public participation in relation to their approval \n16  of border wall construction violates NEPA and its implementing regulations. \n \n17   \nSIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n18  (Ultra Vires) \n19  183.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n20  184.  Defendants are acting ultra vires in seeking to divert funding or resources pursuant to \n21  50 U.S.C. § 1631 and 10 U.S.C. § 2808 for failure to meet the criteria required under those statutes. \n22  There is no emergency requiring the use of the armed forces along the U.S.-Mexico border, \n23  construction of a border wall is not a “military construction project,” and construction of a border \n24  wall is not “necessary to support such use of the armed forces.” \n25  185.  Defendants are acting ultra vires in seeking to divert funding or resources pursuant to \n26  10 U.S.C. § 284 for failure to meet the criteria required under that statute. Construction of the border \n27  wall does not constitute the construction of a road or fence to block “drug smuggling corridors.” In \n28  addition, use of funds under 10 U.S.C. § 284 to construct the border wall in the face of Congress’s \n \n34 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: 4:19-cv-00892-HSG \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 26   Filed 03/18/19   Page 37 of 40\n1  judgment that additional money should not be spent on the wall would violate the Consolidated \n2  Appropriations Act of 2019 because such money, having not been appropriated for wall \n3  construction, cannot be reimbursed to the Department of Defense under 10 U.S.C. § 277. \n4  186.  Defendants are also acting ultra vires in seeking to divert funding or resources \n5  pursuant to 10 U.S.C. § 284 by violating the restrictions in appropriations law, including the \n6  requirements of the Anti-Deficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. § 1341(a)(1), the Purpose Statute, 31 U.S.C. \n7  § 1301(a), and the Transfer Statute, 31 U.S.C. § 1532, as correctly interpreted by the GAO.  An \n8  agency cannot “elect to use (or exhaust) first one and then the other of the two appropriations for the \n9  same class of expenditures.” 10 Comp. Gen. 440, 447 (1931). Yet according to a White House fact \n10  sheet issued on February 15, Defendants intend to use different appropriations “sequentially and as \n11  needed.” In addition, “specific appropriations preclude the use of general ones even when the two \n12  appropriations come from different accounts.” Nevada, 400 F.3d at 16 (citing 4 Comp. Gen. 476 \n13  (1924)). But Defendants have indicated that they will disregard the specific limitation Congress \n14  imposed by allocating only $1.375 billion in funding for border barriers, and use additional, more \n15  general appropriations to fund further border wall construction. Finally, Defendants are violating the \n16  “pick and stick rule,” because the government previously relied on different appropriations than the \n17  Drug Interdiction and Counter-Narcotics Activities account to fund border barrier construction, and \n18  the fiscal year 2019 budget justification for this appropriation includes no mention of any plans to \n19  use the appropriation for walls or fences.  \n20  187.  Defendants are acting ultra vires in seeking to transfer funds into the Drug \n21  Interdiction and Counter-Narcotics Activities account for the purpose of building a permanent border \n22  wall. Section 8005 of the 2019 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, Pub. Law No. 115-245, \n23  prohibits the transfer of Department of Defense funds “where the item for which funds are requested \n24  has been denied by the Congress,” and 10 U.S.C § 2214(b) similarly bars transfers in support of any \n25  “item for which Congress has denied funds.” Congress has denied funding for Defendants’ planned \n26  wall construction, thus barring the Department of Defense from using transfers to fund it. \n27  188.  In addition, Defendants are acting ultra vires in seeking to transfer funds into the \n28  Drug Interdiction and Counter-Narcotics Activities account for the purpose of building a permanent \n \n35 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: 4:19-cv-00892-HSG \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 26   Filed 03/18/19   Page 38 of 40\n1  border wall because Section 8005 of the 2019 Department of Defense Appropriations Act and 10 \n2  U.S.C § 2214(b) prohibit the transfer of Department of Defense funds except where the transfer is to \n3  support an item that is “based on unforeseen military requirements.” The diversion of funding to \n4  build a border wall or fence is not based on unforeseen military requirements, because it is based on \n5  claims that Defendant Trump has made for years, including prior to enactment of the 2019 \n6  Department of Defense Appropriations Act. Moreover, the building of a permanent border wall is \n7  not a “military requirement.” Instead, it is a Department of Homeland Security project. The \n8  Department of Defense is the lead agency only for “detection and monitoring of aerial and maritime \n9  transit of illegal drugs into the United States,” 10 U.S.C. § 124, with no mention of military \n10  responsibilities for securing U.S. land borders.  \n11  189.  Defendants are acting ultra vires in seeking to transfer funds into the Drug \n12  Interdiction and Counter-Narcotics Activities account for the purpose of building a permanent border \n13  wall because Section 8005 of the 2019 Department of Defense Appropriations Act and 10 U.S.C § \n14  2214(b) do not authorize the transfer of Department of Defense funds for the purpose of supporting \n15  another agency’s work. While 10 U.S.C. § 284 funds may, in appropriate circumstances, be used by \n16  the Department of Defense to support another agency’s counterdrug efforts, Congress has not \n17  authorized the Department of Defense to transfer additional Defense funds into the Drug Interdiction \n18  and Counter-Narcotics Activities account for the purpose of supporting another agency, rather than \n19  for military requirements.  \n20  190.  Finally, Defendants are acting ultra vires in seeking to divert funding pursuant to 31 \n21  U.S.C. § 9705 because they fail to meet the criteria required under that statute. Congress did not \n22  authorize use of the Treasury Forfeiture Fund to pay for construction of a border wall, and the \n23  general authorization for use of funds in that statute is controlled by Congress’s more specific \n24  passage of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019. \n \n25 \n \n \n26 \n \n27   \n \n28 \n \n \n36 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: 4:19-cv-00892-HSG \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 26   Filed 03/18/19   Page 39 of 40\n \n1 \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n2  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray that this Court:  \n3  (A)  Declare the President’s direction that Defendants Shanahan, Nielsen, and Mnuchin \n4  reallocate funds to support construction of a border wall under 10 U.S.C. §§ 2808 and \n5  284, Section 8005 of the 2019 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, P.L. No. \n6  115-245, and 31 U.S.C. § 9705 to be ultra vires, in excess of presidential authority \n7  under Article II of the Constitution, an infringement on legislative authority, a \n8  violation of the Presentment Clause, and invalid;  \n9  (B)  Enjoin Defendants Shanahan, Nielsen, and Mnuchin from taking action to build a \n10  border wall using funds or resources from the Defense Department or Treasury Asset \n11  Forfeiture Fund, or on any basis that depends on the President’s unlawful emergency \n12  declaration; \n13  (C)  Declare that Defendants Shanahan, Nielsen, and Nielsen have violated NEPA and its \n14  implementing regulations with respect to the border wall project by, inter alia, failing \n15  to conduct any NEPA analysis, failing to provide any opportunity for public \n16  participation, and failing to take a “hard look” at the potential environmental impacts \n17  of the border wall project; \n18  (D)  Enjoin Defendants Shanahan, Nielsen, and Mnuchin from implementing the border \n19  wall project until and unless Defendants comply with NEPA, the Endangered Species \n20  Act, and the implementing regulations for those laws; \n21  (E)  Award Plaintiffs their reasonable costs of litigation, including reasonable attorneys’ \n22  fees and costs, pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2412 and/or \n23  other authority; and  \n24  (F)  Grant such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. \n \n25 \n   \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n37 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: 4:19-cv-00892-HSG \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 26   Filed 03/18/19   Page 40 of 40\n   \n1 \nDated: March 18, 2019  Respectfully submitted,  \n   \n2 \n  /s/ Dror Ladin  \n3     \nMollie M.

TRUMP, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the\nlaws of the United States of America, including sections 201 and 301 of the National Emergencies\nAct (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), hereby declare that a national emergency exists at the southern border\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-proclamation-declaring-national-emergency-concerning-southern-border-united-states/ 1/2\n\n2/19/2019 PreCsidaensteia l 4Pr:o1c9la-mcavtio-n0 o0n8 D9e2cl-aHrinSg aG N a  tiDonoalc Eummergeennct y2 C6on-1ce r n iFngil tehed S 0ou3th/1er8n /B1o9rd e r  Pof athge eU n3ite od fS t3ates | The White House\nof the United States, and that section 12302 of title 10, United States Code, is invoked and made\navailable, according to its terms, to the Secretaries of the military departments concerned, subject\nto the direction of the Secretary of Defense in the case of the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air\nForce.  To provide additional authority to the Department of Defense to support the Federal\nGovernment’s response to the emergency at the southern border, I hereby declare that this\nemergency requires use of the Armed Forces and, in accordance with section 301 of the National\nEmergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1631), that the construction authority provided in section 2808 of title\n10, United States Code, is invoked and made available, according to its terms, to the Secretary of\nDefense and, at the discretion of the Secretary of Defense, to the Secretaries of the military\ndepartments.  I hereby direct as follows:\nSection 1.  The Secretary of Defense, or the Secretary of each relevant military department, as\nappropriate and consistent with applicable law, shall order as many units or members of the Ready\nReserve to active duty as the Secretary concerned, in the Secretary’s discretion, determines to be\nappropriate to assist and support the activities of the Secretary of Homeland Security at the\nsouthern border.\nSec. 2.  The Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Homeland Security,\nand, subject to the discretion of the Secretary of Defense, the Secretaries of the military\ndepartments, shall take all appropriate actions, consistent with applicable law, to use or support\nthe use of the authorities herein invoked, including, if necessary, the transfer and acceptance of\njurisdiction over border lands.\nSec. 3.  This proclamation is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive\nor procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its\ndepartments, agencies, or entities, its o�icers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fi�eenth day of February, in the year of our\nLord two thousand nineteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the\ntwo hundred and forty-third.\nDONALD J.

Trump, No. 19-cv-00872-HSG, and Sierra Club v. Trump, No. 19-cv-\n20  00892-HSG.1  Plaintiffs in both cases challenge Defendants’ proposed reallocation of $3.6 billion \n21  in military construction funds under 10 U.S.C. § 2808 (“Section 2808”) to build a wall along the \n22  southern border of the United States.  Section 2808 is just one of several alternative sources of \n23 \n                                                 \n1 Plaintiffs in State of California v. Trump are a coalition of nine states, including California, \n24 \nColorado, Hawaii, Maryland, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Wisconsin, and the \nCommonwealth of Virginia (“State Plaintiffs”).  Plaintiffs in Sierra Club v. Trump include the \n25 \nSierra Club and the Southern Border Communities Coalition (“Sierra Club Plaintiffs”).  Because \nPlaintiffs’ motions for summary judgment overlap considerably, the Court refers collectively to \n26 \nboth State and Sierra Club Plaintiffs in this order as “Plaintiffs,” unless otherwise specified.  \nDefendants in both cases include President Donald J. Trump and certain of his cabinet members, \n27 \nin their official government capacities.  The Court refers to them collectively as “Defendants” in \nthis order to avoid confusion in light of the apparent conflict between the Executive and \n28 \nLegislative branches of the government in these cases. \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 2 of 47\n \n1  funding that Defendants identified for border construction after Congress appropriated only \n2  $1.375 billion for that purpose in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019 (“CAA”), far less \n3  than the $5.7 billion the President ultimately requested.  Compare California, 19-cv-00872-HSG, \n4  Dkt. No. 59-4, Ex. 25, with CAA, Pub. L. No. 116-6, 133 Stat. 13 (2019).  Plaintiffs assert that \n5  Defendants’ reliance on Section 2808—like Defendants’ other alternative funding plans—\n6  improperly circumvents the CAA and Congress’ appropriations power under the Constitution.2  \n7  Plaintiffs therefore seek declaratory and injunctive relief, prohibiting Defendants from using funds \n8  under Section 2808 to build border barriers. \n9  As the Court has previously explained, these two cases are not about—and the Court offers \n10  no opinion regarding—whether the challenged border barrier construction plan is sound policy.  \n11  See City and County of San Francisco v. United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, No. \n12  19-17213, (9th Cir. Dec. 5, 2019), Dkt. No. 27 at 2–3 (Bybee, J., concurring) (explaining that \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  “even as we are embroiled in these controversies, no one should mistake our judgments for our \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  policy preferences,” and that “our thoughts on the efficacy of the one approach versus the other \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  are beside the point, since our business is not to judge the wisdom of the National Government’s \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  policy” (quotation omitted)); Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392, 2423 (2018) (indicating that the \nS d nr\nee 17  Supreme Court “express[ed] no view on the soundness of the policy” at issue there); In re Border \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Infrastructure Envtl. Litig., 284 F. Supp. 3d 1092, 1102 (S.D. Cal. 2018) (noting that the court \n19  “cannot and does not consider whether underlying decisions to construct the border barriers are \n20  politically wise or prudent”).3  Neither does the Court here address any of the other sources of \n21  funding that Defendants have identified to pay for the border barrier construction.  Rather, the \n22  issues currently before the Court are narrow:  whether Defendants’ proposed plan for funding \n23 \n                                                 \n2 The Appropriations Clause of the Constitution provides that “No Money shall be drawn from the \n24 \nTreasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.”  U.S. Const. art I., § 9, cl. 7. \n3 There also appears to be no dispute between the Executive and Congress that at least some \n25 \nborder barrier construction is warranted, as Congress has historically appropriated funds for this \npurpose.  For fiscal year 2018, for example, Congress appropriated $1.571 billion for physical \n26 \nbarriers and associated technology along the southwest border.  See California, No. 19-cv-00872-\nHSG, Dkt. No. 161; see also Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, Pub. L. No. 115-141, div. F, \n27 \ntit. II, § 230(a) 132 Stat. 348 (2018).  And even for fiscal year 2019, the Administration initially \nrequested $1.6 billion for border barrier construction, see California, No. 19-cv-00872-HSG, Dkt. \n28 \nNo. 112-1, Ex. 51 at 58, and Congress appropriated $1.375 billion, see CAA, 133 Stat. 13. \n2 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 3 of 47\n \n1  border barrier construction under Section 2808 (1) exceeds the Executive Branch’s statutory and \n2  constitutional authority; (2) is arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 \n3  U.S.C. §§ 551 et seq., (“APA”); and (3) violates the National Environmental Policy Act \n4  (“NEPA”). \n5  Nevertheless, the Court assesses these issues against a complicated and unprecedented \n6  backdrop.  As an initial matter, presidents have only invoked Section 2808 twice since it was \n7  enacted in 1982.  See Michael J. Vassalotti & Brendan W. McGarry, Military Construction \n8  Funding in the Event of a National Emergency, Cong. Research Serv., IN11017 (Jan. 11, 2019) at \n9  2–3; Jennifer K. Elsea, Edward C. Lieu, & Jay B. Sykes,  Can the Department of Defense Build \n10  the Border Wall, Cong. Research Serv., LSB10242 (Feb. 18, 2019) at 3–4.  Of the military \n11  construction projects funded through Section 2808, only one was located in the United States, and \n12  that project related to securing facilities holding weapons of mass destruction shortly after the 9/11 \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  attacks.  See, e.g., Vassalotti, at 1–3; see also Sierra Club, 19-cv-00892-HSG, Dkt. No. 236-5, Ex. \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  5.  And critically, a president has never before invoked Section 2808 to secure funding for projects \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  that Congress specifically declined to fund in its appropriations judgment.  Id.  Yet here the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  President has been explicit in his intention to obtain funds for border barrier construction, with or \nS d nr\nee 17  without Congress.  See, e.g., California, 19-cv-00872-HSG, Dkt. No. 59-4, Exs. 13, 21; Sierra \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Club, 19-cv-00892-HSG, Dkt. No. 36-3, Ex. C.  Accordingly, the President invoked Section 2808 \n19  the day after Congress passed the CAA, which provided limited funding for, and contained \n20  restrictions regarding funding for, border barrier construction.  See CAA, § 230(a)(1), 133 Stat. at \n21  28. \n22  The Court heard argument on these motions on November 20, 2019.  See California, 19-\n23  cv-00872-HSG, Dkt. No. 250; Sierra Club, 19-cv-00892-HSG, Dkt. No. 248.  After carefully \n24  considering the parties’ arguments, the Court GRANTS IN PART Sierra Club Plaintiffs’ partial \n25  motion for summary judgment; GRANTS IN PART State Plaintiffs’ partial motion for summary \n26  judgment; and DENIES Defendants’ motions. \n27  // \n28  // \n3 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 4 of 47\n \n1  I.  BACKGROUND \n2  A.  Factual Background \n3  The Court has detailed the lengthy history of these cases in its prior orders, and \n4  incorporates the factual background in full.  See Sierra Club, No. 19-cv-00892-HSG, Dkt. No. \n5  144.  The Court also briefly summarizes and notes subsequent factual developments as relevant to \n6  this order. \n7  i.  Emergency Declaration \n8  Following the longest partial government shutdown in the nation’s history, Congress \n9  passed the CAA on February 14, 2019, making available $1.375 billion “for the construction of \n10  primary pedestrian fencing, including levee pedestrian fencing, in the Rio Grande Valley Sector.”  \n11  See CAA, § 230(a)(1), 133 Stat. at 28.  On February 15, 2019, the President signed the CAA into \n12  law.  See generally id.  That same day, the President invoked his authority under the National \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Emergencies Act (“NEA”), Pub. L. 94–412, 90 Stat. 1255 (1976) (codified as amended at 50 \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  U.S.C. §§ 1601–51), and declared that “a national emergency exists at the southern border of the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  United States.”  See Proclamation No. 9844, 84 Fed. Reg. 4,949 (Feb. 15, 2019) (“Proclamation \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  No. 9844”).  The proclamation further “declar[ed] that this emergency requires use of the Armed \nS d nr\nee 17  Forces,” and made available “the construction authority provided in [S]ection 2808.”  Id.  When \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  announcing the proclamation, the President explained that he initially “went through Congress” \n19  for the $1.375 billion in funding, but was “not happy with it.”  See California, No. 19-cv-00872-\n20  HSG, Dkt. No. 59-4, Ex. 50. \n21  Since that time, Congress has sought to terminate the national emergency on two separate \n22  occasions.  On March 14, 2019, Congress passed a joint resolution to terminate the emergency \n23  declaration.  See H.R.J. Res. 46, 116th Cong. (2019).  On March 15, 2019, the President vetoed \n24  the joint resolution.  See Veto Message to the House of Representatives for H.J. Res. 46, The \n25  White House (Mar. 15, 2019), https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/veto-message-\n26  house-representatives-h-j-res-46/.  Congress failed to override the President’s veto.  See 165 Cong. \n27  Rec. H2799, H2814–15 (2019).  On September 27, 2019, Congress passed a second joint \n28  resolution to terminate the emergency declaration.  See S.J. Res. 54, 116th Cong. (2019).  And on \n4 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 5 of 47\n \n1  October 15, 2019, the President vetoed the second joint resolution.  See S.J. Res. 54 Veto Message, \n2  The White House (Oct. 15, 2019), https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/s-j-res-54-\n3  veto-message/ (“S.J. Res. 54 Veto Message”).  Again, Congress failed to override the veto.  See \n4  S.J. Res. 54, 116 Cong. (2019).  Congress has an ongoing obligation to consider whether to \n5  terminate the emergency every six months, but the President’s declaration of a national emergency \n6  remains in effect.4  See 50 U.S.C. § 1622(a)–(b). \n7  ii.  Military Construction Funds and Diverted Projects \n8  On February 11, 2019, prior to the President’s proclamation and invocation of Section \n9  2808, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff submitted a preliminary assessment to the Acting \n10  Secretary of Defense regarding whether and how military construction projects could support the \n11  use of the armed forces in addressing a national emergency at the southern border.  See California, \n12  No. 19-cv-00872-HSG, Dkt. No. 212 (“Administrative Record” or “AR”)5 at 119–124.  The \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  memorandum explained that the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) identified specific \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  geographic areas in which border barriers could allow Department of Defense (“DoD”) personnel \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  and resources “to be employed more efficiently” and “reduce DHS requirements for DoD \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  support.”  Id.  However, although the President authorized use of military construction funds \nS d nr\nee 17  under Section 2808 in his February 15 proclamation, Defendants did not exercise this authority for \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  several months. \n19  Instead, in the intervening months, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff submitted a \n20  supplemental assessment on May 6, 2019, regarding military construction projects at the southern \n21 \n                                                 \n4 Under the NEA as initially drafted in 1976, the national emergency would have ended once \n22 \nCongress passed the first joint resolution.  The NEA did not require a presidential signature on the \njoint resolution, nor was it subject to a presidential veto, until the Supreme Court ruled in INS v. \n23 \nChadha that the president must have the power to approve or veto such congressional acts.  See \n462 U.S. 919, 944–58 (1983). \n24 \n5 The parties do not oppose the Court’s consideration of the administrative record, see California, \nNo. 19-cv-00872-HSG, Dkt. Nos. 212-2, 212-3, 212-4, or the Plaintiffs’ request to take judicial \n25 \nnotice of various documents.  The Court finds it may take judicial notice of documents from the \nadministrative record and Plaintiffs’ requests that are cited in this order, all of which are: \n26 \n(1) statements of government officials or entities that are not subject to reasonable dispute; or \n(2) other public records and government documents available on reliable internet sources, such as \n27 \ngovernment websites.  See DeHoog v. Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV, 899 F.3d 758, 763 n.5 (9th \nCir. 2018) (taking “judicial notice of government documents, court filings, press releases, and \n28 \nundisputed matters of public record”). \n5 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 6 of 47\n \n1  border.  See AR at 59–70.  In the updated memorandum, the Chairman again concluded that such \n2  construction “can reasonably be expected to support the use of the armed forces by enabling more \n3  efficient use of DoD personnel, and may ultimately reduce the demand for military support over \n4  time.”  See id. at 60.  The Chairman explained that although “any border barrier construction \n5  supports the use of the armed forces on the border to some extent,” the Joint Chiefs prioritized \n6  fifteen projects, totaling $3.6 billion.  See id. at 63.  On May 15, 2019, Defendants informed the \n7  Court that the Under Secretary of Defense had identified existing military construction project \n8  funding to divert for border barrier construction pursuant to Section 2808, but that the Acting \n9  Secretary of Defense had “not yet decided to undertake or authorize any barrier construction \n10  projects under § 2808.”  See California, 19-cv-00872-HSG, Dkt. No. 151 at 3. \n11  Then on September 3, 2019, the Secretary of Defense announced that he had decided to \n12  authorize eleven specific border barrier construction projects in California, Arizona, New Mexico, \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  and Texas, pursuant to Section 2808.  See California, 19-cv-00872-HSG, Dkt. Nos. 206, 206-1, \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Ex. 1.  In doing so, he reiterated that these projects “will reduce the demand for DoD personnel \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  and assets to other high-traffic areas on the border without barriers.”  See id., Dkt. No. 206-1, Ex. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  1.  He concluded that “[i]n short, these barriers will allow DoD to provide support to DHS more \nS d nr\nee 17  efficiently and effectively.”  Id. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Collectively, the eleven projects total $3.6 billion and include 175 miles of border barrier \n19  construction across four states.  Id.  These projects fall into three categories: \n20  •  Two projects on the Barry M. Goldwater Range military installation in Arizona; \n21  •  Seven projects on federal public domain land that is under the jurisdiction of the \n22  Department of the Interior; and \n23  •  Two projects on non-public land that would need to be acquired through either \n24  purchase or condemnation before construction could begin. \n25  See id., Dkt. Nos. 206 at 2–4, 206-1, Ex. 1.  The Secretary of Defense authorized the Secretary of \n26  the Army “to expeditiously undertake the eleven border barrier military construction projects,” \n27  including taking the necessary steps to acquire the public domain and non-public land as part of \n28  “the Army’s real property inventory, either as a new military installation or as part of an existing \n6 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 7 of 47\n \n1  military installation.”  See id., Dkt. No. 206-1, Ex. 1 at 1; see also AR at 3–6, 9–10, 30–31.  That \n2  same day, in a briefing on the use of Section 2808, DoD representatives explained that the $3.6 \n3  billion would “all go to adding significantly new capabilities to DHS’s ability to prevent illegal \n4  entry.”  See Sierra Club, No. 19-cv-00892-HSG, Dkt. No. 210-2, Ex. 17 at 5. \n5  Two days later, on September 5, 2019, the Secretary of Defense identified which military \n6  construction projects DoD intended to defer in order to fund the border barrier construction \n7  projects.  See California, 19-cv-00872-HSG, Dkt. Nos. 207, 207-1, Ex. 1.  In total, the Secretary \n8  of Defense authorized diverting funding from 128 military construction projects, domestically and \n9  abroad.  See id., Dkt. No. 207-1, Ex. 1.  Sixty-four of the defunded military construction projects \n10  are located within the United States; and nineteen projects, totaling over $500 million, are within \n11  Plaintiff States California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maryland, New Mexico, Oregon, Virginia, and \n12  Wisconsin.  See id.; see also id., No. 19-cv-00872-HSG, Dkt. No. 220-5, Exs. 2–19. \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  The Secretary of Defense explained that he sought to identify projects for defunding and \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  deferral based on the projects’ timing, and thus the 128 projects “are not scheduled for award until \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  fiscal year 2020 or later.”  See AR at 13.  Doing so, he stated, would “provide [DoD] time to work \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  with [Congress] to determine opportunities to restore funds for these important military \nS d nr\nee 17  construction projects . . . .”  California, 19-cv-00872-HSG, Dkt. No. 206-2, Ex. 2 at 2; cf. S. 1790, \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  116th Cong. § 2906 (“Replenishment of Certain Military Construction[] Funds”).  The deferred \n19  projects include rebuilding hazardous materials warehouses at Norfolk and the Pentagon; \n20  replacing a daycare facility for servicemembers’ children at Joint Base Andrews, which reportedly \n21  suffers from “sewage backups, flooding, mold and pests”; and improving security to comply with \n22  anti-terrorism and force protection standards at Kaneohe Bay.  See Sierra Club, No. 19-cv-00892-\n23  HSG, Dkt. No. 202-1, Ex. 1; id., Dkt. No. 210-2, Ex. 18; see also California, No. 19-cv-00872-\n24  HSG, Dkt. No. 232 (Brief of Amici Curiae Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America) (“IAVA \n25  Brief”). \n26  In accordance with the Secretary of Defense’s directive, the Secretary of the Army has \n27  taken steps over the past few months to obtain administrative jurisdiction over some of the land \n28  for the border barrier construction projects.  On October 7, 2019, the Secretary of the Interior \n7 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 8 of 47\n \n1  announced the transfer of approximately 560 acres of federal lands to the Department of the Army \n2  for a period of three years for border barrier construction in Arizona, California, and New Mexico.  \n3  See California, No. 19-cv-00872-HSG, Dkt. No. 220-5, Ex. 1.  Additionally, on October 8, 2019, \n4  the Secretary of the Army issued General Order No. 2019-36, which automatically assigns all land \n5  transferred to the Army for Section 2808 border barrier construction projects to the U.S. Army \n6  Garrison Fort Bliss, Texas, irrespective of the location of the land.  See id., Dkt. No. 236-7, Ex. 7. \n7  During the hearing on the motions for partial summary judgment, Defendants’ counsel also \n8  represented to the Court that there have been two contracts awarded related to the border barrier \n9  construction projects.  See California, No. 19-cv-00872-HSG, Dkt. No. 254 at 81:2–24.  The first \n10  contract relates to the projects on the Barry M. Goldwater Range, in Arizona:  that contract was \n11  awarded on November 6, 2019, and ground disturbing activity was anticipated to start no earlier \n12  than November 27, 2019.  Id.  The second contract relates to a project in San Diego County, \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  California:  that contract was awarded on November 19, 2019, and ground disturbing activity was \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  anticipated to start no earlier than December 9, 2019.  Id. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  B.  Procedural History \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Following the passage of the CAA and the President’s national emergency declaration in \nS d nr\nee 17  February 2019, the State and Sierra Club Plaintiffs filed suit challenging Defendants’ anticipated \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  diversion of federal funds for border barrier construction pursuant to several statutory provisions.  \n19  These include reallocating funds from the Treasury Forfeiture Fund; DoD’s Appropriations Act of \n20  2019 under Section 8005 and 10 U.S.C. § 284; and DoD appropriations for military construction \n21  projects under Section 2808.  See Sierra Club, No. 19-cv-00892-HSG, Dkt. No. 36-7, Ex. G at 2–\n22  4; see also id., Dkt. No. 64-8, ¶¶ 5–6. \n23  The Court first preliminarily enjoined Defendants’ use of funds for two border barrier \n24  construction projects in New Mexico and Arizona under Section 8005.  See Sierra Club, No. 19-\n25  cv-00892-HSG, Dkt. No. 144.  The Court reasoned that Plaintiffs were likely to show that (1) the \n26  language and purpose of Section 8005 precluded Defendants’ transfer and use of funds for \n27  construction of border barriers because Congress had already explicitly denied those requested \n28  funds; (2) the need for such funds was not unforeseen as the Administration had requested such \n8 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 9 of 47\n \n1  funding as early as 2018; and (3) Defendants’ proposal likely would violate the Constitution’s \n2  separation of powers principles to the extent it bypassed Congress’ appropriations authority.  Id.  \n3  At the time, Sierra Club Plaintiffs also sought a preliminary injunction to preclude Defendants’ \n4  proposed use of Section 2808.  See id., Dkt. No. 29 at 13–15, 23–25.  However, the Court found \n5  that Plaintiffs could not show irreparable harm as needed to warrant an injunction because as of \n6  May 2019, Defendants had not yet made a final decision as to whether to use Section 2808 funds.  \n7  Id., Dkt. No. 144 at 51–53. \n8  The Court subsequently affirmed its ruling on Defendants’ use of Section 8005, granting in \n9  part the motions for partial summary judgment filed by California, New Mexico, and the Sierra \n10  Club Plaintiffs, and denying Defendants’ motions for partial summary judgment.  See California, \n11  No. 19-cv-00872-HSG, Dkt. No. 185; Sierra Club, No. 19-cv-00892-HSG, Dkt. No. 185.  The \n12  Court entered a permanent injunction, prohibiting Defendants from taking any action to construct \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  a border barrier in the six sectors that Defendants identified in New Mexico, Arizona, and \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  California, using funds reprogrammed by DoD under Section 8005.  Sierra Club, No. 19-cv-\ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  00892-HSG, Dkt. No. 185 at 10. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Following the Court’s summary judgment orders, Defendants filed an emergency \nS d nr\nee 17  application with the Ninth Circuit for a stay of the injunction.  On July 3, 2019, the Ninth Circuit \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  motions panel denied the stay application, finding that Defendants’ border barrier construction \n19  was not authorized by any statutory appropriation, such that the proposed reprogramming and use \n20  of these funds violated the Appropriations Clause.  See Sierra Club v. Trump, 929 F.3d 670, 676–\n21  77 (9th Cir. 2019).  The motions panel further held—over Defendants’ objection—that Plaintiffs \n22  have an equitable cause of action to challenge Defendants’ funding proposal as unconstitutional, \n23  and that Plaintiffs satisfied any “zone of interests” test that may apply to their claim.  See id. at \n24  694–704; see also Section III.A below. \n25  On July 26, 2019, the Supreme Court stayed the permanent injunction pending resolution \n26  of the government’s appeal before the Ninth Circuit and any subsequent writ of certiorari.  See \n27  Trump v. Sierra Club, 140 S. Ct. 1 (2019).  In the one-paragraph decision, the Supreme Court \n28  stated that “the Government has made a sufficient showing at this stage that the plaintiffs have no \n9 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 10 of 47\n \n1  cause of action to obtain review of the Acting Secretary’s compliance with Section 8005.”  Id.  \n2  The Supreme Court, however, provided no further explication of its reasoning, and the appeal \n3  before the Ninth Circuit regarding Section 8005 remains pending. \n4  In the interim, the parties agreed to stay the summary judgment briefing schedule as to \n5  Section 2808 and the Treasury Forfeiture Fund until the Acting Secretary of Defense and U.S. \n6  Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”), respectively, reached a final decision to fund specific \n7  barrier construction projects under these provisions.  See California, No. 19-cv-00872-HSG, Dkt. \n8  Nos. 199, 200; Sierra Club, No. 19-cv-00892-HSG, Dkt. Nos. 191, 197.  Because the Secretary of \n9  Defense has since announced his authorization for border barrier construction projects pursuant to \n10  Section 2808, as detailed in Section I.A.ii above, the parties now move for partial summary \n11  judgment as to this proposal. \n12  II.  LEGAL STANDARD \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Summary judgment is proper when a “movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  A fact is “material” if it “might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.”  Anderson \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).  And a dispute is “genuine” if there is evidence \nS d nr\nee 17  in the record sufficient for a reasonable trier of fact to decide in favor of the nonmoving party.  Id.  \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  But in deciding if a dispute is genuine, the court must view the inferences reasonably drawn from \n19  the materials in the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, Matsushita Elec. \n20  Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587–88 (1986), and “may not weigh the evidence \n21  or make credibility determinations,” Freeman v. Arpaio, 125 F.3d 732, 735 (9th Cir. 1997), \n22  overruled on other grounds by Shakur v. Schriro, 514 F.3d 878, 884–85 (9th Cir. 2008).  If a court \n23  finds that there is no genuine dispute of material fact as to only a single claim or defense or as to \n24  part of a claim or defense, it may enter partial summary judgment.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). \n25  III.  DISCUSSION \n26  A.  Plaintiffs’ Cause of Action \n27  As a threshold matter, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs lack a cause of action through \n28  which they may challenge the proposed use of military construction funds under Section 2808.  \n10 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 11 of 47\n \n1  They argue that Plaintiffs may not seek equitable relief through an implied cause of action under \n2  the Constitution, and that Plaintiffs fall outside the zone of interests protected by Section 2808 and \n3  the CAA.  As Defendants acknowledge, they raised the same arguments before this Court and the \n4  Ninth Circuit motions panel in the context of Plaintiffs’ challenge to funding a border wall using \n5  Section 8005.  In response, the Ninth Circuit engaged in a detailed discussion—and rejection—of \n6  each point, concluding that “Plaintiffs have an avenue for seeking relief.”  See Sierra Club, 929 \n7  F.3d at 694–704; see also Sierra Club, No. 19-cv-00892-HSG, Dkt. No. 245 (Brief of Amici \n8  Curiae Federal Courts Scholars). \n9  First, the Ninth Circuit held that Plaintiffs could challenge the reprogramming of funds \n10  under Section 8005 “through an equitable action to enjoin unconstitutional official conduct.”  \n11  Sierra Club, 929 F.3d at 694.  Plaintiffs’ argument there, as here, is that Defendants’ attempt to \n12  reprogram funds for border barrier construction violates the Appropriations Clause, and thus \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  separation of powers principles, because “Defendants lack any background constitutional authority \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  to appropriate funds.”  See id. at 696.  The Ninth Circuit confirmed that such a claim is \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  “fundamentally a constitutional one,” and “Plaintiffs may seek equitable relief to remedy an \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  alleged constitutional violation.”  Id. at 695–97.  That Defendants rely on Section 8005 (or here, \nS d nr\nee 17  Section 2808) as the basis for their efforts to reallocate funds for border barrier construction does \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  not convert a constitutional claim into a statutory one.  See id. at 697 (“It cannot be that simply by \n19  pointing to any statute, governmental defendants can foreclose a constitutional claim.”). \n20  Second, the Ninth Circuit expressed “doubt[] that any zone of interests test applies to \n21  Plaintiffs’ equitable cause of action to enjoin a violation of the Appropriations Clause.”  Id. at 700.  \n22  A zone of interests test is used “to ‘determine, using traditional tools of statutory interpretation, \n23  whether a legislatively conferred cause of action encompasses a particular plaintiff’s claim.’”  Id. \n24  (quoting Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 127 (2014)).  The \n25  test “ask[s] whether the plaintiff’s ‘interests fall within the zone of interests protected by the law \n26  invoked.’”  Id. (quoting Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 129).  The Ninth Circuit highlighted the problems \n27  with applying a zone of interests test to Plaintiffs’ constitutional claim:  “[W]here the very claim is \n28  that no statutory or constitutional provision authorized a particular governmental action, it makes \n11 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 12 of 47\n \n1  little sense to ask whether any statutory or constitutional provision was written for the benefit of \n2  any particular plaintiffs.”  Id. at 701 (emphasis omitted).  Moreover, “[b]ecause the Constitution \n3  was not created by any act of Congress, it is hard to see how the zone of interests test would even \n4  apply.”  Id. at 702.  Thus, the Court concluded that “it is likely sufficient here that Plaintiffs would \n5  be concretely injured by the alleged Appropriations Clause violation, and that no zone of interests \n6  test applies to their claim.”  Id. at 701. \n7  Third, even if a zone of interests test did apply to such a constitutional claim, the Ninth \n8  Circuit explained that the proper inquiry is whether Plaintiffs fall within the zone of interests of \n9  the constitutional provision, and not the statute Defendants raise in defense.  Id. at 703–04.  The \n10  Court explained that “individuals, too, are protected by the operations of separation of powers and \n11  checks and balances,” and thus, Plaintiffs’ contention “that their rights or liberties were infringed \n12  by a violation of the Appropriations Clause . . . falls within any zone of interests required to \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  enforce that clause’s provisions.”  Id. at 704 (quotation omitted). \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  i.  Miller v. Gammie \nrts fo\niD tc 15  Defendants urge the Court to disregard the Ninth Circuit’s reasoning in light of the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Supreme Court’s opinion staying the permanent injunction as to Section 8005.  See Trump, 140 S. \nS d nr\nee 17  Ct. at 1.  Defendants argue that the “Supreme Court decision sends a strong signal” that they \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  ultimately will prevail on the claim that their exercise of authority under Section 8005 may not be \n19  challenged by these Plaintiffs.  See Sierra Club, No. 19-cv-00892-HSG, Dkt. No. 236 at 11.  This \n20  claimed “strong signal” is based on a sentence in the Supreme Court’s stay order stating that “the \n21  Government has made a sufficient showing at this stage that the plaintiffs have no cause of action \n22  to obtain review of the Acting Secretary’s compliance with Section 8005.”  See Trump, 140 S. Ct. \n23  at 1. 6  However, notwithstanding Defendants’ characterization of this “signal,” the Court may not \n24 \n                                                 \n6 The October 15, 2019, veto message went further, claiming that the proclamation itself “has \n25 \nwithstood judicial challenge in the Supreme Court.”  See S.J. Res. 54 Veto Message.  This is \ninaccurate:  the injunction that was the subject of the stay involved a funding source that did not \n26 \ndepend on the emergency declaration, and the validity of the proclamation has never been \naddressed by the Ninth Circuit or the Supreme Court.  See Sierra Club, 929 F.3d at 686 \n27 \n(explaining that the Ninth Circuit’s opinion “does not address any sources of funds Defendants \nmight use to build a border barrier except those reprogrammed under section 8005”), 679, & n.1 \n28 \n(explaining that DoD’s proposed use of funds reprogrammed under Section 8005 to provide \n12 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 13 of 47\n \n1  so readily disregard the Ninth Circuit’s opinion.  The Ninth Circuit has cautioned that only in \n2  cases of “clear irreconcilability” can district courts “consider themselves bound by the intervening \n3  higher authority and reject the prior opinion of [the Ninth Circuit] as having been effectively \n4  overruled.”  Miller v. Gammie, 335 F.3d 889, 899–900 (9th Cir. 2003) (en banc).  “This is a high \n5  standard,” which “requires [the district court] to look at more than the surface conclusions of the \n6  competing authority.”  Rodriguez v. AT & T Mobility Servs. LLC, 728 F.3d 975, 979 (9th Cir. \n7  2013) (quotation omitted). \n8  At this stage, the Court can only speculate regarding the reasoning underlying the stay, \n9  including what it means for how the Supreme Court may ultimately assess the merits of these two \n10  cases.7  As Justice Breyer explained, “[t]his case raises novel and important questions about the \n11  ability of private parties to enforce Congress’ appropriations power.”  Trump, 140 S. Ct. 1 \n12  (Breyer, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  Because the Supreme Court opinion does \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  not address these questions directly, the Court cannot find that it is “clearly irreconcilable with the \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  reasoning or theory” in the Ninth Circuit panel opinion.  See Miller, 335 F.3d at 899; accord Close \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  v. Sotheby’s, Inc., 894 F.3d 1061, 1074 (9th Cir. 2018) (holding that even where a prior panel \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  opinion’s “reasoning would be suspect today, [] it is not clearly irreconcilable with intervening \nS d nr\nee 17  higher authority”); Doe v. Trump, 284 F. Supp. 3d 1182, 1184–85 (W.D. Wash. 2018) (“[T]his \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  court is not at liberty to simply ignore binding Ninth Circuit precedent based on Defendants’ \n19  divination of what the Supreme Court was thinking when it issued the stay orders . . . .”).  The \n20  Ninth Circuit’s opinion in Sierra Club v. Trump therefore controls this Court’s analysis. \n21  ii.  Zone of Interests \n22  Following the Ninth Circuit’s reasoning, as it must, the Court finds that Plaintiffs may \n23  challenge Defendants’ funding for border barrier construction under Section 2808.  As with their \n24 \n                                                 \n25 \nsupport for other agencies under section 284 “does not require the declaration of a national \nemergency”).  \n26 \n7 During oral argument on the motions, counsel for Defendants also acknowledged that he did not \nknow the precise grounds on which the Supreme Court stayed the permanent injunction.  Counsel \n27 \nopined that the majority could have “meant there is not a cause of action period, or there’s not a \ncause of action for these plaintiffs because of the zone of interests test” applicable to their claim.  \n28 \nSee California, No. 19-cv-00872-HSG, Dkt. No. 254 at 53:17–20. \n13 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 14 of 47\n \n1  challenge to Defendants’ use of funds under Section 8005, Plaintiffs’ claim that Defendants’ use \n2  of military construction authority under Section 2808 violates the Appropriations Clause is \n3  “fundamentally a constitutional” claim.  See Sierra Club, 929 F.3d at 696–97.  And to the extent \n4  Plaintiffs must fall within the zone of interests of the Appropriations Clause to assert this claim, \n5  see id. at 703–04, the Court finds this “low bar” easily satisfied here.  See Cook v. Billington, 737 \n6  F.3d 767, 771 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (Kavanaugh, J.) (“A plaintiff with Article III standing satisfies the \n7  requirement unless his interests are so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes \n8  implicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress intended to permit the \n9  suit.” (quotation omitted)). \n10  The Court first looks to the fundamental interests protected by the Appropriations Clause, \n11  and observes that the importance of those interests cannot be overstated.  The Appropriations \n12  Clause “is particularly important as a restraint on Executive Branch officers:  If not for the \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Appropriations Clause, the Executive would possess an unbounded power over the public purse of \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  the nation; and might apply all its monied resources at his pleasure.”  U.S. Dep’t of Navy v. Fed. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Labor Relations Auth., 665 F.3d 1339, 1347 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (Kavanaugh, J.) (quotation omitted).  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  As such, members of the public, and not just Congress, have an interest in ensuring that the \nS d nr\nee 17  Constitution’s checks on executive power are upheld.  As the Ninth Circuit noted, “[t]he \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Appropriations Clause is a vital instrument of separation of powers, which has as its aim the \n19  protection of individual rights and liberties—not merely separation for separation’s sake.”  Sierra \n20  Club, 929 F.3d at 704.  Both State and Sierra Club Plaintiffs assert that if Defendants proceed with \n21  their proposed spending plan in contravention of Congress’ appropriations judgment, they will \n22  suffer injury to their “environmental, professional, aesthetic, and recreational interests.”  Id.  In \n23  short, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have a cause of action to challenge Defendants’ invocation of \n24  Section 2808 as unconstitutional, and proceeds to analyze this claim below. \n25  B.  Section 2808 \n26  The Ninth Circuit’s opinion in Sierra Club v. Trump further guides the Court’s analysis of \n27  Plaintiffs’ constitutional claim.  See Sierra Club, 929 F.3d at 689–92.  Plaintiffs’ claim—and the \n28  legal theory undergirding both cases—is that Defendants seek to circumvent Congress’ \n14 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 15 of 47\n \n1  appropriations power, and its judgment to provide the Administration with limited funds for \n2  specified and limited border barrier construction, by seeking funding through alternative channels.  \n3  Defendants’ counsel characterized the Administration’s approach as “a full-court press,” meaning \n4  they are using any means that they contend are available to them to fund a border wall.  See \n5  California, No. 19-cv-00872-HSG, Dkt. No. 254 at 73:5–19.  Although Plaintiffs appear to \n6  challenge all funding for border barrier construction outside of the CAA, for purposes of this \n7  order, Defendants contend that in Section 2808, Congress allowed Defendants to make this \n8  reallocation from existing military construction projects to the border barrier construction.  \n9  Because Congress only exercises its appropriations power through statutes, the Ninth Circuit \n10  accordingly focused its analysis on the text and purpose of Defendants’ asserted defense.  Sierra \n11  Club, 929 F.3d at 689–92.  The critical inquiry, therefore, is whether Section 2808 authorizes this \n12  reallocation.  If it does not, “then Defendants are acting outside of any statutory appropriation and \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  are therefore spending funds contrary to Congress’s appropriations decisions.”  Id. at 689.  The \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Court therefore analyzes whether Defendants’ conduct falls within the statutory authority provided \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  by Section 2808. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Under Section 2808, the Secretary of Defense may use funds previously appropriated for \nS d nr\nee 17  other projects in limited circumstances where three factors are satisfied:  (1) there is a national \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  emergency that requires use of the armed forces, and (2) “military construction projects” are \n19  (3) “necessary to support such use of the armed forces.”  See 10 U.S.C. § 2808(a).  Plaintiffs \n20  challenge all three conditions, arguing that Defendants fail to satisfy any of them. \n21  i.  Justiciability \n22  As a threshold matter, Defendants assert that the Court may not assess whether they have \n23  satisfied the statute’s requirements, because their decision to undertake military construction \n24  pursuant to Section 2808 was entirely committed to agency discretion.  See Sierra Club, No. 19-\n25  cv-00892-HSG, Dkt. No. 236 at 15–16, 19–20.  Defendants reason that there is no meaningful \n26  standard against which the Court can determine whether the President or Secretary of Defense \n27  exceeded the authority granted by Congress by declaring a national emergency that required use of \n28  the armed forces; authorizing use of Section 2808; or undertaking military construction projects \n15 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 16 of 47\n \n1  under Section 2808.  Id.  In short, Defendants contend that the President and Secretary of Defense \n2  have unreviewable discretion, under both the NEA and Section 2808, to determine whether an \n3  emergency exists that meets the statutory criteria.  Plaintiffs indicated during oral argument that \n4  they are not challenging the President’s emergency declaration per se, but rather whether it meets \n5  the statutory criteria for an emergency under Section 2808.  See California, No. 19-cv-00872-\n6  HSG, Dkt. No. 254 at 12:6–16:12.  The Court addresses that narrow challenge as part of its \n7  statutory analysis in Section III.B.ii.  Here, however, the Court cabins its analysis to Defendants’ \n8  argument that their invocation of Section 2808 itself is committed to agency discretion by law, and \n9  as such, is nonjusticiable.  See 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2).  The Court disagrees that its ability to review \n10  Defendants’ conduct is so circumscribed. \n11  As the Ninth Circuit has repeatedly held, “[t]he default rule is that agency actions are \n12  reviewable under federal question jurisdiction, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 . . . even if no statute \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  specifically authorizes judicial review.”  See Perez v. Wolf, No. 18-35123, 2019 WL 6224421, at \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  *5 (9th Cir. Nov. 11, 2019) (quoting ANA Int’l, Inc. v. Way, 393 F.3d 886, 890 (9th Cir. 2004)).  A \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  decision is generally committed to agency discretion by law, and thus not subject to judicial \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  review, when a court would have “no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency’s \nS d nr\nee 17  exercise of discretion.”  Id. at *5 (quotation omitted).  This is rare.  “Only where there is truly ‘no \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  law to apply’ ha[s] [the Ninth Circuit] found an absence of meaningful standards of review.”  Id. \n19  at *6 (quoting Spencer Enterprises, Inc. v. United States, 345 F.3d 683, 688 (9th Cir. 2003)).  \n20  Courts must assess “the language of the statute and whether the general purposes of the statute \n21  would be endangered by judicial review.’”  ASSE Int’l, Inc. v. Kerry, 803 F.3d 1059, 1068 (9th \n22  Cir. 2015) (quotation omitted). \n23  Engaging in this exercise, the Ninth Circuit recently explained that “courts routinely treat \n24  discretion-laden standards as providing ‘law to apply.’”  Perez, 2019 WL 6224421, at *8–*9 \n25  (collecting cases).  In Perez v. Wolf, the Ninth Circuit held that U-Visa determinations made by \n26  the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (“USCIS”) are subject to judicial review \n27  because the statutory framework provides a meaningful standard against which to assess the \n28  agency’s exercise of discretion.  Id. at 15–16.  The statutory provision requires that a U-Visa \n16 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 17 of 47\n \n1  applicant: \n \n2  (1) has suffered “substantial physical or mental abuse” as a result of \nhaving been a victim of qualifying criminal activity; (2) “possesses \n3  information” about qualifying criminal activity; and (3) “has been \nhelpful, is being helpful, or is likely to be helpful” to an authority \n4  “investigating or prosecuting” qualifying criminal activity. \n5   \n6  Id. at *8 (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(U)(i)).  Although terms such as “substantial” and “helpful” \n7  contain an element of subjectivity, the Ninth Circuit nevertheless found that they constituted “law \n8  to apply.”  Id. \n9  The Court finds that Section 2808 likewise provides “meaningful standards” for reviewing \n10  Defendants’ compliance with its conditions.  The diversion of funds from existing military \n11  construction projects is only authorized for (1)  “military construction projects” that are \n12  (2) “necessary to support such use of the armed forces.”  See 10 U.S.C. § 2808(a).  Congress \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  defined military construction as “any construction, development, conversion, or extension of any \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  kind carried out with respect to a military installation, whether to satisfy temporary or permanent \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  requirements, or any acquisition of land or construction of a defense access road.”  Id. § 2801(a).  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  And Congress defined “military installation,” in turn, as “a base, camp, post, station, yard, center, \nS d nr\nee 17  or other activity under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of a military department or, in the case of \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  an activity in a foreign country, under the operational control of the Secretary of a military \n19  department or the Secretary of Defense, without regard to the duration of operational control.”  Id. \n20  § 2801(c)(4).  Section 2808 therefore establishes statutory standards that constrain its use.  And \n21  applying these standards to determine “whether the reprogramming of funds is consistent with the \n22  Appropriations Clause and [Section 2808] . . . is a familiar judicial exercise.”  See Sierra Club, \n23  929 F.3d at 687 (quotation omitted). \n24  That the statute conditions authorization on the existence of a national emergency and the \n25  use of the armed forces does not, on its own, convert the legal exercise of statutory interpretation \n26  into a purely political one.  The Ninth Circuit’s opinion in United States v. Spawr Optical \n27  Research, Inc., is illustrative.  In Spawr, President Gerald Ford relied on the continued existence \n28  of two national emergencies to forbid the shipment of certain strategic items to foreign countries \n17 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 18 of 47\n \n1  under the Trading with the Enemy Act (“TWEA”).  685 F.2d 1076, 1079–80 (9th Cir. 1982).  \n2  During a national emergency, TWEA empowered the president to “regulate, . . . prevent or \n3  prohibit . . . any exportation of . . . or transactions involving[] any property in which any foreign \n4  country . . . has any interest.”  50 U.S.C. § 4305(b)(1)(B).  The Ninth Circuit distinguished \n5  between “the essentially political questions surrounding the declaration or continuance of a \n6  national emergency,” on the one hand, and the legal question of “whether the actions taken \n7  pursuant to a national emergency comport with the power delegated by Congress,” on the other.  \n8  See Spawr, 685 F.2d at 1080–81.  The Ninth Circuit held that courts “are free to review” whether \n9  the Executive Branch has legal authority to act, and went on to determine whether the regulations \n10  at issue were rationally related to the emergencies.  See id. at 1081 (concluding that “President \n11  Ford’s effort to limit the exportation of strategic items clearly had a rational relationship to the \n12  prevention of aggression and armed conflict”). \na \ntr in\nuoro 13    The Court fully appreciates that “[n]ational-security policy is the prerogative of the \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Congress and President,” and that their military judgments are due deference.  See Ziglar v. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. 1843, 1861 (2017); see also Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U.S. 57, 66 (1981) \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  (acknowledging “a healthy deference to legislative and executive judgments in the area of military \nS d nr\nee 17  affairs”).  But “the judiciary appropriately exercises its constitutional function where the question \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  is whether Congress or the Executive is aggrandizing its power at the expense of another branch.”  \n19  Sierra Club, 929 F.3d at 687 (quotation omitted).  As the Ninth Circuit explained, “‘courts cannot \n20  avoid their responsibility merely because the issues have political implications.’”  Id. (quoting \n21  Zivotofsky v. Clinton, 566 U.S. 189, 196 (2012)).  The Court accordingly may, and must, \n22  determine whether Defendants have exceeded the limits set by Congress regarding spending under \n23  Section 2808, while affording both branches due deference.  As summarized by the Ninth Circuit \n24  in another case in which the Executive Branch invoked national security concerns in support of its \n25  nonjusticiability argument: \n26   \nTo  declare  that  courts  cannot  even  look  to  a  statute  passed  by \n27  Congress to fulfill international obligations turns on its head the role \nof the courts and our core respect for a co-equal political branch, \n28  Congress.  Interpreting and applying [the statute at issue] does not \n18 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 19 of 47\n \nprevent the military from planning and building bases.  It requires \n1  only  that  the  executive  take  into  account  certain  procedural \nobligations, required by Congress, before it takes steps forward.  The \n2  courts may then look to whether the executive complied with its \nobligations.  We may consider national security concerns with due \n3  respect when the statute is used as a basis to request injunctive relief.  \nThis is not a grim future, and certainly no grimmer than one in which \n4  the executive branch can ask the court for leave to ignore acts of \nCongress. \n5 \n6  Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Mattis, 868 F.3d 803, 825–26 (9th Cir. 2017). \n7  ii.  Statutory Interpretation \n8  Having found that Section 2808 provides meaningful standards against which the Court \n9  may analyze Defendants’ conduct under the statute, the Court reviews their compliance with those \n10  standards.  The Court provided its initial impression as to Defendants’ compliance with Section \n11  2808 in its preliminary injunction order in Sierra Club v. Trump.  See Sierra Club, 19-cv-00892-\n12  HSG, Dkt. No. 144 at 42–46.  At the time, the Court expressed reservations that “border barrier \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  construction could reasonably constitute a ‘military construction project’ such that Defendants’ \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  invocation of Section 2808 would be lawful,” and also raised concerns that Defendants’ \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  interpretation of Section 2808 would cede unbounded authority to Defendants to redirect military \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  construction funds.  See id. at 42–43.  Now that Defendants have specified how they intend to use \nS d nr\nee 17  Section 2808, the Court confirms its preliminary analysis, finding that the eleven border barrier \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  projects are not  “military construction projects” that are “necessary to support such use of the \n19  armed forces.”  See 10 U.S.C. § 2808(a). \n20  a.  Emergency Requiring Use of the Armed Forces \n21  Sierra Club Plaintiffs alone challenge the President’s February 15 declaration of a national \n22  emergency to the extent that the President simultaneously concluded that this emergency required \n23  use of the armed forces.8  See Sierra Club, No. 19-cv-00892-HSG, Dkt. No. 210 at 9–11.  Sierra \n24  Club Plaintiffs couch this as a statutory condition, and thus as a matter of statutory interpretation \n25  under Section 2808 rather than one of policy or politics.  The Court is not persuaded. \n26 \n                                                 \n27 \n8 State Plaintiffs, on the other hand, explicitly note that for purposes of their motion for partial \nsummary judgment they are not challenging the President’s declaration of a national emergency.  \n28 \nSee California, No. 19-cv-00872-HSG, Dkt. No. 220 at 8. \n19 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 20 of 47\n \n1  Sierra Club Plaintiffs assert that there is no true emergency at the southern border, and that \n2  even if there were, DHS, not DoD, has jurisdiction over protecting the nation’s borders.  In \n3  support of their challenge, Sierra Club Plaintiffs point to the text of the proclamation itself, which \n4  states in relevant part: \n \n5  [R]ecent years have seen sharp increases in the number of family units \nentering and seeking entry to the United States and an inability to \n6  provide detention space for many of these aliens while their removal \nproceedings  are  pending . . .  [T]he  Department  of  Defense  has \n7  provided  support  and  resources  to  the  Department  of  Homeland \nSecurity at the southern border.  Because of the gravity of the current \n8  emergency situation, it is necessary for the Armed Forces to provide \nadditional support to address the crisis. \n9   \n10  Proclamation No. 9844.  Plaintiffs contend that “unarmed parents and children seeking refuge do \n11  not require a military response.”  See Sierra Club, No. 19-cv-00892-HSG, Dkt. No. 210 at 11.  \n12  Plaintiffs also point to comments made by DoD officials outside the proclamation that the \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  situation at the border is “not a military threat.”  See, e.g., id., Dkt. No. 210-2, Ex. 15 at 50–52 \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  (Acting U.S. Secretary of Defense Shanahan and General Joseph Dunford concurring that the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  “situation on the southern border” is a “security challenge” and “not a military threat”); Ex. 16 at 2 \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  (Admiral Michael M. Gilday, Operations Director of the Joint Staff, stating that “[n]one of the \nS d nr\nee 17  capabilities that we are providing are combat capabilities” and “[i]t’s not a war zone along the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  border”).  Rather, in Plaintiffs’ view, Defendants are using DoD’s temporary and limited support \n19  of DHS—the civilian agency that Congress has tasked with border security and immigration \n20  enforcement—to justify funding the border barriers that DHS has sought to build.  See, e.g., 6 \n21  U.S.C. §§ 202, 251; 8 U.S.C. §§ 1103(a)(5), (a)(10). \n22  At bottom, Plaintiffs’ theory is premised on the idea that the proclamation was designed \n23  solely to avoid Congress’ appropriations judgment and that the emergency is a convenient pretext.  \n24  The Court acknowledges that both the timing and nature of the emergency raise obvious questions.  \n25  The Administration repeatedly and unsuccessfully sought appropriations from Congress for border \n26  barrier construction.  When Congress and the President could not agree on such funding, the \n27  President suggested his willingness to declare a national emergency if Congress refused to \n28  appropriate the money he requested.  See, e.g., California, 19-cv-00872-HSG, Dkt. No. 59-4, Ex. \n20 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 21 of 47\n \n1  21.  When asked about his threshold for declaring an emergency, the President stated, “[m]y \n2  threshold will be if I can’t make a deal with people that are unreasonable.”  See George Sargent, \n3  Trump: I have the ‘absolute right’ to declare a national emergency if democrats defy me, Wash. \n4  Post (Jan. 9, 2019), https://tinyurl.com/y5f5eqwg.  And the President then declared the national \n5  emergency one day after Congress passed the CAA, which limited appropriations for border \n6  barrier construction.  See Proclamation No. 9844.  In announcing the national emergency \n7  declaration, the President explained, “I could do the wall over a longer period of time.  I didn’t \n8  need to do this.  But I’d rather do it much faster. . . .  And I think that I just want to get it done \n9  faster, that’s all.”  See California, No. 19-cv-00872-HSG, Dkt. No. 59-4, Ex. 50. \n10  All this said, there is no precedent for a court overriding a President’s discretionary \n11  judgment as to what is and is not an emergency.  That one of the conditions to invoke Section \n12  2808 is that the emergency require use of the armed forces does not alter the nature of the inquiry.  \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Sierra Club Plaintiffs are still asking the Court to evaluate the “policy choice[] and value \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  determination[]” underlying the President’s emergency proclamation.  Japan Whaling Ass’n v. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Am. Cetacean Soc., 478 U.S. 221, 230 (1986).  Plaintiffs have not cited, and the Court has not \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  found, any case in which a court has assessed the nature and validity of an emergency \nS d nr\nee 17  proclamation.  Cf. California, No. 19-cv-00872-HSG, Dkt. No. 254 at 12:6–16:12.  To the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  contrary, as discussed in Section III.B.i above, the Ninth Circuit has characterized “the declaration \n19  or continuance of a national emergency” as an “essentially political question[].”  Spawr, 685 F.2d \n20  at 1080–81.  The Court accordingly finds that whether the national emergency truly exists, and \n21  requires use of the armed forces, are nonjusticiable political questions. \n22  The Court nevertheless acknowledges the significant constitutional tension inherent in the \n23  President’s invocation of a national emergency under the NEA for the avowed purpose of \n24  accessing money to fund projects that Congress expressly considered and declined to fund.  It is \n25  apparent that at the time Congress enacted the NEA it did not envision the statute would (or even \n26  could) be used to circumvent the will of Congress.  As the Court previously explained, Congress \n27  initially reserved the right to terminate a national emergency with a simple majority and without \n28  the opportunity for a presidential veto.  See Sierra Club, No. 19-cv-00892-HSG, Dkt. No. 144 at \n21 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 22 of 47\n \n1  13–14, & n.8; see also id., Dkt. No. 219 at 10–15 (Brief of Amici Curiae Brennan Center for \n2  Justice and the Cato Institute) (“Brennan Center Brief”).  Thus, prior to the Supreme Court’s \n3  opinion in INS v. Chadha, it would have been impossible for the President to use the NEA to \n4  somehow bypass the will of a congressional majority.  See 462 U.S. at 944–58; see also Sierra \n5  Club, No. 19-cv-00892-HSG, Dkt. No. 219 (Brennan Center Brief) at 15 (“The notion that \n6  Congress intended the NEA as an affirmative delegation of unlimited discretion to the president—\n7  one that would allow the president to circumvent the will of Congress on specific policy \n8  proposals—is contradicted by this and every other aspect of the legislative history.”).   \n9  Still, Congress is not without recourse.  Under the NEA, “[a]ny national emergency \n10  declared by the President in accordance with this subchapter shall terminate if . . . there is enacted \n11  into law a joint resolution terminating the emergency.”  50 U.S.C. § 1622(a)(1).  Moreover, the \n12  NEA not only allows, but in fact obligates, Congress to “consider a vote on a joint resolution to \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  determine whether that emergency shall be terminated” every six months.  See id. § 1622(b).  \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Congress thus has the authority to monitor and if needed, reverse, the President’s determination \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  that circumstances at the southern border constitute a national emergency.  That Congress has so \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  far been unable to override the President’s veto with a two-thirds majority vote does not somehow \nS d nr\nee 17  transform this fundamentally political question into a legal one.  Because the national emergency \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  remains in effect, the Court may not opine as to whether the President properly invoked the NEA \n19  by declaring a national emergency requiring the use of the armed forces at the southern border. \n20  b.  Military Construction Project \n21  Next, the parties disagree as to whether the border barrier construction projects constitute \n22  “military construction projects” for purposes of Section 2808.9  As noted above, Congress defined \n23  the term “military construction” to “include[] any construction, development, conversion, or \n24  extension of any kind carried out with respect to a military installation, whether to satisfy \n25 \n                                                 \n9 During the hearing, Sierra Club Plaintiffs explained that they are not challenging whether the two \n26 \nprojects on the Barry M. Goldwater Range, an existing military installation, constitute military \nconstruction for purposes of Section 2808.  See California, No. 19-cv-00872-HSG, Dkt. No. 254 \n27 \nat 85:12–19.  Defendants have identified these two projects as Yuma Project 2 and Yuma Project \n10/27.  But Plaintiffs still challenge whether any of the eleven projects are necessary to support \n28 \nuse of the armed forces.  See Section III.B.ii.c. \n22 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 23 of 47\n \n1  temporary or permanent requirements, or any acquisition of land or construction of a defense \n2  access road . . . .”  10 U.S.C. § 2801(a).  Because it is apparent that border barrier construction \n3  constitutes “construction,” the critical question before the Court is whether the eleven proposed \n4  projects are being “carried out with respect to a military installation.”  Id.; see also id. § 2801(b) \n5  (“A military construction project includes all military construction work . . . necessary to produce \n6  a complete and useable facility or a complete and usable improvement to an existing facility.”). \n7  A “military installation,” in turn, “means a base, camp, post, station, yard, center, or other \n8  activity under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of a military department . . . .”  Id. § 2801(c)(4).  \n9  Defendants do not attempt to characterize the projects as either a “base, camp, post, station, yard, \n10  [or] center.”  See id. § 2801(c)(4).  Instead, they reason that the 175 miles of proposed border \n11  barrier construction fall within the “other activity” definition because DoD has obtained—or will \n12  obtain—administrative jurisdiction over the land for these projects and assign it to Fort Bliss in \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Texas.  See California, No. 19-cv-00872-HSG, Dkt. No. 236-7, Ex. 7 (General Order No. 2019-\nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  36).  By obtaining administrative jurisdiction over the land in this way, they conclude, all eleven \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  projects will be part of an existing military installation.  Id.  In other words, Defendants contend \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  that “military installation” is “inclusive of [any] activities under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of \nS d nr\nee 17  a military department.”  See id., Dkt. No. 236 at 13.  The Court finds several flaws with this \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  expansive interpretation. \n19  First, Defendants’ interpretation requires the Court to disregard the plain language of the \n20  statute.  Defendants would have the Court transform the definition of “military installation” to \n21  include not just “other activity,” but “any activity” under military jurisdiction.  That simply is not \n22  what the statute says.10  As the Supreme Court has noted, when interpreting a statute, context \n23  matters.  See, e.g., McDonnell v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 2355, 2368 (2016) (“[W]e look to the \n24 \n                                                 \n25 \n10 In its opposition to Sierra Club Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction as to Section \n2808, see Sierra Club, No. 19-cv-00892-HSG, Dkt. No. 64 at 21–23, Defendants initially posited \n26 \nthat the as-yet unidentified border barrier projects would fall within the “other activity” category.  \nApplying traditional tools of statutory construction, the Court explained that “a base, camp, post, \n27 \nstation, yard, [and] center” are all discrete and traditional military locations, and “other activity” \nmust refer to similar locations.  The Court incorporates that reasoning again here, in all respects.  \n28 \nSee id., Dkt. No. 144 at 44–45. \n23 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 24 of 47\n \n1  context in which the words appear.”); see also ASARCO, LLC v. Celanese Chem. Co., 792 F.3d \n2  1203, 1210 (9th Cir. 2015) (“[T]he plain language of a statute should be enforced according to its \n3  terms, in light of its context.”).  And here, as the Court cautioned before, the terms “base, camp, \n4  post, station, yard, [or] center” are not mere surplusage to ignore, but rather supply meaning and \n5  provide boundaries to the term “other activity.”  See, e.g., McDonnell, 136 S. Ct. at 2369 \n6  (explaining that canons of construction are “wisely applied . . . to avoid the giving of unintended \n7  breadth to the Acts of Congress” (quotation omitted)); Yates v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 1074, \n8  1087 (2015) (“Had Congress intended ‘tangible object’ in § 1519 to be interpreted so generically \n9  as to capture physical objects as dissimilar as documents and fish, Congress would have had no \n10  reason to refer specifically to ‘record’ or ‘document.’  The Government’s unbounded reading of \n11  ‘tangible object’ would render those words misleading surplusage.”); CSX Transp., Inc. v. Ala. \n12  Dept. of Revenue, 562 U.S. 277, 295 (“We typically use ejusdem generis to ensure that a general \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  word will not render specific words meaningless.”).  Defendants do not even attempt to explain \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  how the proposed projects are similar in nature or scope to “a base, camp, post, station, yard, [or] \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  center,” 10 U.S.C. § 2801(c)(4), and the Court finds that they are not. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Rather than engaging with the text of the statute, Defendants rely heavily on the Supreme \nS d nr\nee 17  Court’s decision in United States v. Apel, 571 U.S. 359, 368 (2014).  There, the Supreme Court \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  noted that “‘military duty’ and ‘military protection’ are synonymous with the exercise of military \n19  jurisdiction,” and that the term “‘military installation’ is used [that way] elsewhere in federal law.”  \n20  Id. (emphasis omitted).  The Supreme Court, however, was not analyzing the definition of military \n21  installations under Section 2808 or 10 U.S.C. § 2801(c)(4).  The case involved an entirely \n22  different statute under Title 18, which imposed a criminal fine on anyone who reentered a \n23  “military, naval, or Coast Guard reservation, post, fort, arsenal, yard, station, or installation” after \n24  being removed.  See 18 U.S.C. § 1342.  The question before the Court in Apel was whether a \n25  public easement on an Air Force base was still considered part of the military installation.  The \n26  Court rejected “[t]he use-it-or-lose-it rule” that § 1342 only applied where the military had \n27  exclusive use, possession, or control over the property in question.  Apel, 571 U.S. at 372.  In \n28  doing so, the Court cited the language of 10 U.S.C. § 2801(c)(4), but did not engage in any \n24 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 25 of 47\n \n1  analysis of its possible limitations.  See id. at 368.  Indeed, to the extent Apel provides any insight \n2  for the interpretation of Section 2808, it is simply that statutes must be read in context, and with an \n3  eye toward common sense.  Id. at 369–72. \n4  Defendants also suggest that Congress intended “military installation” in Section 2808 to \n5  be read broadly because elsewhere it defined the term differently.  Under 10 U.S.C. § 2687(g)(1), \n6  for example, Congress defined “military installation” in the context of base closures to “mean[] a \n7  base, camp, post, station, yard, center, homeport facility for any ship, or other activity under the \n8  jurisdiction of the Department of Defense,” but excluded “any facility used primarily for civil \n9  works, rivers and harbors projects, or flood control projects.”  Id.  The Court acknowledges that \n10  Congress may provide different definitions in different statutes, but this does not open the door to \n11  a limitless definition of military installation in Section 2808.  Again, part of the inquiry is context \n12  and congressional intent, but Defendants do not engage with either. \na \ntr in\nuoro 13   Second, Defendants’ interpretation would grant them essentially boundless authority to \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  reallocate military construction funds to build anything they want, anywhere they want, provided \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  they first obtain jurisdiction over the land where the construction will occur.  Although Defendants \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  attempt to reassure the Court that they “are not arguing that the entire southern U.S. border” \nS d nr\nee 17  constitutes a military installation for purposes of Section 2808, see California, No. 19-cv-00872-\nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  HSG, Dkt. No. 236 at 13, there is nothing in their interpretation to preclude them from doing so.  \n19  When asked during the hearing whether Defendants’ reading of Section 2808 had a limiting \n20  principle, counsel could not articulate one.  See id., Dkt. No. 254 at 62:21–64:3. \n21  The scale of what is possible under this reading is immense.  The eleven projects at issue \n22  in the instant motions are illustrative.  Defendants acknowledge that nine of the proposed projects \n23  are on federal public domain or non-public land, not previously under military jurisdiction.  See \n24  id., Dkt. Nos. 206 at 2–4, 206-1, Ex. 1.  These nine projects, which cover 140 of the 175 total \n25  miles of border barrier construction at issue, are located on land spanning several hundred miles in \n26  Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas.  But Fort Bliss, the military installation to which \n27  Defendants will administratively assign the land, is located near El Paso, Texas.  Defendants \n28  suggest that projects located several hundred miles away from Fort Bliss are nevertheless “carried \n25 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 26 of 47\n \n1  out with respect to [that] military installation,” provided Defendants complete the right paperwork.  \n2  See 10 U.S.C. § 2801(a).11  Under this interpretation, construction can be considered “carried out \n3  with respect to a military installation” even if it is otherwise wholly unrelated to the installation’s \n4  functions, purpose, or even geography.  Indeed, Defendants do not offer any substantive \n5  connection between the proposed construction here and Fort Bliss.  Instead they acknowledge that \n6  the construction sites are assigned administratively to Fort Bliss “for real property accountability \n7  purposes.”  See California, No. 19-cv-00872-HSG, Dkt. No. 251 at 4; see id., Dkt. No. 251-1 at \n8  ¶¶ 7–11.  They further state that “Fort Bliss is the largest, most capable Active Army installation \n9  in the vicinity of the southern border.”  Id.  The Court is not persuaded that Congress intended \n10  “military construction” to have no stronger connection to a military installation than Defendants’ \n11  own administrative convenience.  If this were true, Defendants could redirect billions of dollars \n12  from projects to which Congress appropriated funds to projects of Defendants’ own choosing, all \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  without congressional approval (and in fact directly contrary to Congress’ decision not to fund \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  these projects).  Elevating form over substance in this way risks “the Executive [] aggrandizing its \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  power at the expense of [Congress].”  Sierra Club, 929 F.3d at 687 (quotation omitted). \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Third, Defendants’ interpretation contravenes clear congressional intent to limit—not \nS d nr\nee 17  expand—executive emergency powers.  The NEA was passed in 1976 as a reform measure, \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  following concern about the duration of the national emergencies that presidents had declared \n19  historically, and the scope of their related emergency powers.  See L. Elaine Halchin, National \n20  Emergency Powers, Cong. Research Serv., 98-505 (Aug. 5, 2019).  For example, an emergency \n21  declaration that was issued at the start of the Korean War in 1950 was still being used decades \n22 \n                                                 \n23 \n11 The Court notes that in an August 21, 2019, “Action Memo,” the Assistant Secretary of \nDefense, Homeland Defense and Global Security said that in order for border barrier projects to \n24 \nconstitute military construction projects, a military department would need to report the land in its \ninventory “either as its own installation or as part of an existing, nearby military installation.”  AR \n25 \nat 3 (emphasis added).  Defendants now contend that this common-sense “nearby” condition is not \nactually a formal requirement of the statute.  See California, No. 19-cv-00872-HSG, Dkt. No. 251 \n26 \nat 3–4.  Even if that is technically true, the Court finds it plain that Defendants’ characterization of \nthe breadth of the asserted power to cobble together far-flung parcels as part of one “military \n27 \ninstallation” goes far beyond any historical example they cite.  See id., Dkt. No. 249 at 7–8 (citing \nauxiliary landing field located 40 miles away from main military installation as an example of a \n28 \n“geographically separated location[] . . . part of, but physically separate from” that installation). \n26 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 27 of 47\n \n1  later with respect to the Vietnam War.  Id. at 7.  In 1973, there were four national emergencies still \n2  in effect from 1933, 1950, 1970, and 1971.  See id.  The Senate, therefore, created a special \n3  committee, known as the Special Committee on National Emergencies and Delegated Emergency \n4  Powers, to evaluate this issue.  See id. at 7–8.  Through its work, the Committee identified 470 \n5  provisions of federal law that granted the president extensive emergency powers.  See id. at 8. \n6  The Committee developed legislation—the NEA—to limit the scope of such emergency \n7  powers.  In support of the NEA, the Committee explained the need to place limits on the \n8  presidential use of emergency powers: \n9   \nRight now, hundreds of emergency statutes confer enough authority \n10  on the President to rule the country without reference to normal \nconstitutional process.  Revelations of how power has been abused by \n11  high  government  officials  must  give  rise  to  concern  about  the \npotential  exercise,  unchecked  by  the  Congress  or  the  American \na  12  people, of this extraordinary power.  The National Emergencies Act \ntr in would end this threat and [e]nsure that the powers now in the hands \nuoro 13  of the Executive will be utilized only in time of genuine emergency \nCfi\n tla and then only under safeguards providing for Congressional review. \ncC 14 \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  See Sierra Club, No. 19-cv-00892-HSG, Dkt. No. 219 (Brennan Center Brief) at 12–13 (quoting \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  The National Emergencies Act (Public Law 94-412), Source Book: Legislative History, Text, and \nS d nr\nee 17  Other Documents (1976) (“NEA Source Book”).  In its report, the Committee noted that “[t]he \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  National Emergencies Act is not intended to enlarge or add to Executive power.  Rather the statute \n19  is an effort by the Congress to establish clear procedures and safeguards for the exercise by the \n20  President of emergency powers conferred upon him by other statutes.”  Id. at 14 (quoting NEA \n21  Source Book). \n22  In keeping with this narrower view of executive emergency powers, Section 2808 has \n23  rarely been used, and never to fund projects for which Congress withheld appropriations.  Rather, \n24  Section 2808 has been used to build projects like aircraft hangars, barracks, airfield runways, \n25  detention facilities, logistics hubs, and waste water treatment plants.  See Vassalotti, at 2–3.  \n26  Defendants’ invocation of Section 2808 for border barrier construction, in conflict with Congress’ \n27 \n28 \n27 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 28 of 47\n \n1  judgment on those projects, is simply unprecedented, contrary to the Administration’s claims. 12  \n2  This, on its own, is enough to warrant close scrutiny:  “When an agency claims to discover in a \n3  long-extant statute an unheralded power to regulate a significant portion of the American \n4  economy, we typically greet its announcement with a measure of skepticism.”  Util. Air \n5  Regulatory Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 324 (2014) (quotation omitted).  Put simply, the Court \n6  does not find that Section 2808 was intended to be used to resolve policy disputes with Congress \n7  or to provide the Executive Branch with unchecked power to transform the responsibilities \n8  assigned by law to a civilian agency into military ones by reclassifying large swaths of the \n9  southern border as “military installations.”  Such an interpretation defies both the text and spirit of \n10  the statute.  The Court, therefore, finds that the border barrier construction projects, with the \n11  exception of the two projects on the Barry M. Goldwater range, are not “carried out with respect to \n12  a military installation” within the meaning of Section 2808. \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  c.  Necessary to Support Use of the Armed Forces \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Even assuming the border barrier construction could somehow be considered military \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  construction for purposes of Section 2808, the parties also disagree as to whether the proposed \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  projects are necessary to support the use of the armed forces.  Defendants rely on a lengthy \nS d nr\nee 17  administrative record, which, they say, explains why the projects are necessary to provide such \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  support.  But even crediting all facts in the administrative record, and giving due deference to the \n19  strategic and military determinations in it, the Court finds that Defendants have not established \n20  that the projects are necessary to support the use of the armed forces. \n21  The problem is twofold.  Inherent in Defendants’ argument and the administrative record is \n22  that the proposed border barrier projects are intended to support and benefit DHS, a civilian \n23  agency, rather than the armed forces.  And although the administrative record explains why such \n24 \n                                                 \n25 \n12 Compare S.J. Res. 54 Veto Message (“Proclamation 9844 was neither a new nor novel \napplication of executive authority.  Rather it is the sixtieth Presidential invocation of the [NEA].  \n26 \nIt relies upon the same statutory authority used by both of the previous two Presidents to \nundertake more than 18 different military construction projects from 2001 through 2013.”), with \n27 \nSierra Club, No. 19-cv-00892-HSG, Dkt. No. 219 (Brennan Center Brief) at 20 (“Perhaps most \nsignificantly, in none of these cases did presidents invoke emergency powers to take action after \n28 \nCongress had explicitly considered and rejected legislation to authorize such action.”).  \n28 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 29 of 47\n \n1  border barrier projects may be beneficial to DHS’s mission, Defendants have not established that \n2  they are in fact necessary to support the use of the armed forces—which is the statutory limitation \n3  set by Congress.  The Court discusses each issue in turn. \n4  On April 4, 2018, the President directed the Secretary of Defense to support DHS “in \n5  securing the southern border and taking other necessary actions” due to “[t]he crisis at our \n6  southern border.”  See California, 19-cv-00872-HSG, Dkt. No. 59-4, Ex. 27.  The President \n7  further empowered the Secretary of Defense to “request use of National Guard personnel to assist” \n8  as needed.  Id.  As of August 13, 2019, DoD had approximately 5,500 personnel supporting DHS \n9  in its “border security mission.”  See AR at 1, 45.  DoD personnel are generally serving in \n10  “support roles that relieve DHS personnel of non-law enforcement duties,” such as “logistics, \n11  planning, and intelligence analysis” and “monitoring and detection support” through “operating \n12  mobile surveillance cameras units or providing aerial reconnaissance.”  Id. at 42.  DHS stated that \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  the proposed border barrier projects that DHS recommended to DoD would “give a distinct and \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  enduring advantage to [U.S. Border Patrol] as a force multiplier,” and would “likely reduce DHS’s \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  reliance on DoD for force protection, surveillance support, engineering support, air support, \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  logistical support, and strategic communications assistance.”  Id. at 43 (quotation omitted).  In \nS d nr\nee 17  sum, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and DHS summarized that the projects would \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  “allow DoD to provide support to DHS more efficiently and effectively.”  See id. at 48; see also \n19  id. at 59–71. \n20  The administrative record therefore illustrates that the border barrier construction projects \n21  are intended to benefit DHS and its subagencies, including CBP and U.S. Border Patrol (“USBP”).  \n22  The record explains that physical barriers, such as those proposed, may “[i]mprove CBP’s \n23  detection, identification, classification, and response capabilities,” AR at 4; “[r]educe \n24  vulnerabilities in key border areas and the time it takes for Border Patrol agents to apprehend \n25  illegal migrants,” id.; “reduce the challenges to CBP,” id. at 61; “serve to channel illegal \n26  immigrants towards locations that are operationally advantageous to DHS,” id.; “reduce the \n27  enforcement footprint and compress USBP operations,” id. at 43; “enable CBP agents to focus less \n28  on the rugged terrain,” id. at 69; and as noted above, “give a distinct and enduring advantage to \n29 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 30 of 47\n \n1  USBP as a force multiplier,” id. at 43; see also id. at 121–24.  As DoD representatives have \n2  forthrightly explained, funding under Section 2808 would “all go to adding significantly new \n3  capabilities to DHS’s ability to prevent illegal entry.”  See Sierra Club, No. 19-cv-00892-HSG, \n4  Dkt. No. 210-2, Ex. 17 at 5. \n5  That the border barrier projects would benefit DHS is unsurprising, as Congress \n6  empowered that agency to “[s]ecur[e] the borders, territorial waters, ports, terminals, waterways, \n7  and air, land, and sea transportation systems of the United States.”  6 U.S.C. § 202; see also 8 \n8  U.S.C. §§ 1103(a)(5) (charging the Secretary of Homeland Security with “the power and duty to \n9  control and guard the boundaries and borders of the United States”).  But this is a civilian agency, \n10  and not part of the armed forces.  The commission of these responsibilities to DHS is no secret:  \n11  the entire reason for the longest shutdown of the Federal government in history was that the \n12  President sought over $5 billion in appropriations to DHS for these exact projects, and Congress \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  exercised its constitutional prerogative to decline to authorize that spending.  Put another way, the \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  entire dispute in this case arises from the Executive’s efforts to find other ways to help DHS do \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  what Congress directly said it would not authorize when it rejected the Executive’s DHS budget \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  request.  \nS d nr\nee 17  Defendants suggest that the assistance to DHS is merely a byproduct of helping DoD.  See, \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  e.g., California, No. 19-cv-00872-HSG, Dkt. No. 249 at 10.  Yet the administrative record \n19  suggests that the proposed projects may actually reduce DHS’s need for DoD support.  See, e.g., \n20  AR at 4 (noting that the projects “could ultimately reduce the demand for DoD support at the \n21  southern border over time”).  As the President put it, “[i]f we had a wall, we don’t need the \n22  military because we’d have a wall.”  See Sierra Club, No. 19-cv-00892-HSG, Dkt. No. 210-2, Ex. \n23  13 at 5.  Defendants do not explain how the projects are necessary to support the use of the armed \n24  forces while simultaneously obviating the need for those forces.  This appears to defy the purpose \n25  of Section 2808, which specifically refers to construction that is necessary to support the use of the \n26  armed forces, not to construction that the armed forces will not use once constructed.  Again, \n27  Defendants’ argument proves too much.  Under their theory, any construction could be converted \n28  into military construction—and funded through Section 2808—simply by sending armed forces \n30 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 31 of 47\n \n1  temporarily to provide logistical support to a civilian agency during construction.  But Congress, \n2  and not Defendants, holds the power of the purse.  The Court declines to interpret Section 2808 to \n3  provide the Secretary of Defense with almost limitless authority to use billions of dollars of its \n4  appropriations to build projects for the benefit of DHS, even when Congress specifically declined \n5  to give DHS itself the funds to build those projects.  See, e.g., Util. Air Regulatory Grp., 573 U.S. \n6  at 324 (“We expect Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency decisions of vast \n7  economic and political significance.” (quotation omitted)). \n8  The administrative record also fails to establish that the border barrier construction projects \n9  are “necessary to support [] use of the armed forces.”  See 10 U.S.C. § 2808(a) (emphasis added).  \n10  The Oxford English Dictionary defines “necessary” as “[i]ndispensable, vital, essential.”  See \n11  Necessary, OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY ONLINE (last visited Nov. 20, 2019); accord MERRIAM-\na  12  WEBSTER ONLINE DICTIONARY (defining “necessary” as “absolutely needed: required”) (last \ntr in\nuoro 13  visited Nov. 20, 2019).  Yet Defendants simply contend that the projects will “allow DoD to \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  provide support to DHS more efficiently and effectively.”  See AR at 48.  Even accepting this \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  conclusion as true, promoting efficiency and efficacy is not tantamount to necessity, given the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  nature of the construction at issue.  And the Court declines Defendants’ invitation to blur this \nS d nr\nee 17  distinction.  There is simply nothing in the record before the Court indicating that the eleven \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  border barrier projects—however helpful—are necessary to support the use of the armed forces. \n19  The Court does not lightly reach the conclusion that the record does not support \n20  Defendants’ claim of necessity here.  The undersigned deeply respects the work of the United \n21  States armed forces, and understands and is grateful for the innumerable sacrifices made by \n22  military women and men, and their families, in service of our country.  See California, No. 19-cv-\n23  00872-HSG, Dkt. No. 232 (IAVA Brief) at 9 (“Service members are used to discomfort.  They \n24  signed up to endure hardships so that the rest of American society could live freely and \n25  comfortably. . . .  But they should never be asked to work in unnecessarily unsafe or harmful \n26  conditions, or to wait even longer for basic facilities that are already long overdue.”).  And the \n27  Court has no doubt that Congress shares this respect and gratitude.  Were this case about \n28  constructing hangars for storage of aircraft used in “aerial reconnaissance,” or building a control \n31 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 32 of 47\n \n1  center for “operating mobile surveillance camera units,” AR at 42, the circumstances likely would \n2  be very different. \n3  But the Court cannot blind itself to the plain reality presented in this case:  the border \n4  barrier projects Defendants now assert are “necessary to support the use of the armed forces” are \n5  the very same projects Defendants sought—and failed—to build under DHS’s civilian authority, \n6  because Congress would not appropriate the requested funds.  Even where review is “deferential,” \n7  courts “are ‘not required to exhibit a naiveté from which ordinary citizens are free.’”  See Dep’t of \n8  Commerce v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2575 (2019) (quoting United States v. Stanchich, 550 \n9  F.2d 1294, 1300 (2d Cir. 1977) (Friendly, J.)); see also Karnoski v. Trump, 926 F.3d 1180, 1202 \n10  (9th Cir. 2019) (“Of course, deference does not mean abdication.”) (quotation omitted).  DoD \n11  officials have forthrightly acknowledged that the border barrier projects are intended to fulfill the \n12  President’s priorities.  During a congressional hearing on the reprogramming of funds for border \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  barrier construction, Acting U.S. Secretary of Defense Shanahan explained that “given a legal \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  order from the commander in chief, we are executing on that order.”  See John Wagner, Paul \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Sonne, and Dan Lamothe, Pentagon announces $1 billion transfer for border barriers, angering \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Democrats, Wash. Post (March 26, 2019), https://tinyurl.com/y2njmvsk.  Similarly, when asked \nS d nr\nee 17  during the hearing about prioritizing the border wall over military readiness and modernization, \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  U.S. Army Secretary Esper said “I’m saying that the Department of Defense made decisions based \n19  on what the president set as priorities, and we are following through.  We are executing.”  Id.   \n20  The parties do not suggest that additional factfinding would buttress or clarify the rationale \n21  or need for the projects.  The Court therefore finds that the projects are not necessary to support \n22  the use of the armed forces.  As the Supreme Court has explained, “[r]egardless of how serious the \n23  problem an administrative agency seeks to address, . . . it may not exercise its authority in a \n24  manner that is inconsistent with the administrative structure that Congress enacted into law.”  FDA \n25  v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 125 (2000) (quotation omitted).  \n26  Accordingly, taking into account the totality of the record, the Court finds that Defendants have \n27  not satisfied the mandatory conditions set by Congress in Section 2808, and that they thus are not \n28  authorized to redirect military construction funds to the eleven border barrier projects they have \n32 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 33 of 47\n \n1  identified. \n2  C.  APA \n3  State Plaintiffs further contend that Defendants’ conduct is reviewable as unlawful under \n4  the APA.  Plaintiffs first suggest that by failing to comply with the statutory conditions in Section \n5  2808, Defendants have acted “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short \n6  of statutory right.”  See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C).  Such arguments, however, collapse into the same \n7  analysis of Section 2808 that the Court detailed in Section III.B above.  See Sierra Club, 929 at \n8  689–92.  The Ninth Circuit acknowledged when analyzing Section 8005 that “Plaintiffs either \n9  have an equitable cause of action to enjoin a constitutional violation, or they can proceed on their \n10  constitutional claims under the Administrative Procedure Act, or both.”  Id. at 676–77.  However, \n11  the analysis—whether under the Constitution or the APA—remains the same.  Id.13 \n12  State Plaintiffs also make a second and distinct claim that Defendants have violated the \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  APA’s prohibition on arbitrary and capricious agency action.  See California, No. 19-cv-00872-\nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  HSG, Dkt. No. 220 at 13–15.  Plaintiffs argue that in identifying and reallocating funds from 128 \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  existing military construction projects, Defendants did not “address any of the harms to public \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  health and safety” that would result from defunding those projects.  Id. at 13.  The Court finds this \nS d nr\nee 17  argument meritless.  “The scope of review under the ‘arbitrary and capricious’ standard is narrow \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  and a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of \n19  U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).  Rather, “the agency must \n20  examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a \n21  rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.”  Id. (quotation omitted).  Here, \n22  the administrative record provides such an explanation, indicating that Defendants identified \n23  projects for defunding to “provide [DoD] time to work with [Congress] to determine opportunities \n24  to restore funds for these important military construction projects . . . .”  California, No. 19-cv-\n25 \n                                                 \n26 \n13 Although Sierra Club Plaintiffs do not raise an independent claim under the APA, they note, as \nthe Ninth Circuit has recognized, that the Court may consider their claim challenging the use of \n27 \nmilitary construction funds either as an equitable action to enjoin unconstitutional conduct or \nunder the APA as final agency action that violates the Constitution.  See Sierra Club, No. 19-cv-\n28 \n00892-HSG, Dkt. No. 210 at 21–22 (citing Sierra Club, 929 at 676–77). \n33 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 34 of 47\n \n1  00872-HSG, Dkt. No. 206-2, Ex. 2 at 2.  For the same reasons discussed above, it is not the \n2  Court’s task to decide whether it finds the substance of Defendants’ rationale for defunding or \n3  delaying these projects persuasive or wise, and State Plaintiffs’ disagreement with that rationale \n4  does not make the decision arbitrary and capricious. \n5  D.  National Environmental Policy Act \n6  Plaintiffs also seek a declaratory judgment deeming unlawful Defendants’ failure to \n7  comply with NEPA before undertaking the proposed military construction projects under Section \n8  2808.14  NEPA is intended “to promote efforts which will prevent or eliminate damage to the \n9  environment and biosphere and stimulate the health and welfare of man.”  42 U.S.C. § 4321.  \n10  Under NEPA, federal agencies must assess the environmental impact of agency actions that \n11  “significantly affect[ ] the quality of the human environment.”  Id. § 4332(C).  Where an agency’s \n12  project “might significantly affect environmental quality,” NEPA compels preparation of an \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Environmental Impact Statement (“EIS”).  See WildEarth Guardians v. Provencio, 923 F.3d 655, \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  669 (9th Cir. 2019).  Plaintiffs contend that Defendants were required to prepare an EIS for the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  proposed border barrier construction projects, but failed to do so here. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  In response, Defendants point to the language of Section 2808, which by its terms, \nS d nr\nee 17  authorizes “the Secretary of Defense, without regard to any other provision of law, [to] undertake \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  military construction projects . . . .”  10 U.S.C. § 2808.  The Secretary of Defense mirrored this \n19  language in directing the Secretary of the Army “to expeditiously undertake the eleven border \n20 \n                                                 \n14 State Plaintiffs also attempt to expand their NEPA cause of action to include the land transfer \n21 \nfrom the Department of the Interior for the proposed border barrier construction projects, but their \ncomplaint does not assert such a claim.  See California, No. 19-cv-00872-HSG, Dkt. No. 47 at \n22 \n¶¶ 392–99.  Rather, their NEPA claim explicitly states that “Defendant DHS is in violation of \nNEPA and the APA because it failed to prepare an [Environmental Impact Statement] concerning \n23 \nborder wall development projects that will have adverse effects on the environment . . . .”  Id. at \n¶ 397.  Even reading the complaint liberally, the operative complaint does not “give the defendant \n24 \nfair notice of what the plaintiff’s claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.”  See Pickern v. \nPier 1 Imports (U.S.), Inc., 457 F.3d 963, 968 (9th Cir. 2006) (holding district court did not err in \n25 \nfinding plaintiff failed to provide adequate notice of her claims where she presented specific \nfactual grounds for those claims for first time on summary judgment) (quotation omitted).  The \n26 \nCourt may not now grant summary judgment as to a claim that State Plaintiffs never asserted until \ntheir motion for summary judgment, when they never sought leave to amend the complaint.  See \n27 \nWasco Prod., Inc. v. Southwall Techs., Inc., 435 F.3d 989, 992 (9th Cir. 2006) (“Simply put, \nsummary judgment is not a procedural second chance to flesh out inadequate pleadings.” \n28 \n(quotation omitted)). \n34 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 35 of 47\n \n1  barrier military construction projects,” and “to do so without regard to any other provision of law \n2  that may impede the expeditious construction of such projects in response to the national \n3  emergency.”  See California, No. 19-cv-00872-HSG, Dkt.

The Court finds \n4  that the language in Section 2808 is clear on its face, and permits the Secretary of Defense, if \n5  properly acting within his authority under Section 2808, to undertake military construction \n6  projects without regard to NEPA. \n7  Plaintiffs attempt to restrict this “notwithstanding” language by divorcing Defendants’ \n8  ability to re-prioritize military construction projects from their ability to actually construct those \n9  projects.  Plaintiffs urge that only the former power to “restructur[e] construction priorities” may \n10  be undertaken “without regard to any other provision of law.”  See, e.g., Sierra Club, No. 19-cv-\n11  00892-HSG, Dkt. No. 210 at 19–20.  The Court finds no evidence for this reading, as the statute \n12  permits the Secretary to “undertake military construction projects,” not just to prioritize them. \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Plaintiffs next contend that the Court should still read the “notwithstanding” language \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  narrowly because had Congress intended to waive NEPA’s requirements, the statute would have \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  included language that the projects be undertaken “without delay” or “expeditiously.”  Id. at 20.  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  However, there are no magic words constraining Congress’ ability to empower Defendants to \nS d nr\nee 17  proceed without consideration of NEPA or other laws.  Rather, the Court must “tak[e] into account \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  the whole of the statutory context in which [the notwithstanding clause] appears.”  See United \n19  States v. Novak, 476 F.3d 1041, 1046 (9th Cir. 2007).  Here, Plaintiffs’ argument is belied by the \n20  statutory prerequisite that there be a declaration of war or a national emergency before Section \n21  2808 may be used for military construction.  Such a condition, by its nature, normally would \n22  require speed.  The Court finds it unreasonable to conclude that in the face of war or a national \n23  emergency, Congress would require Defendants to engage in the time-intensive EIS process prior \n24  to undertaking projects “necessary to support [] use of the armed forces.”  See 10 U.S.C. § 2808.  \n25  Plaintiffs’ concern that Section 2808 would “empower[] the Secretary of Defense to build almost \n26  anything, anywhere,” see Sierra Club, No. 19-cv-00892-HSG, Dkt. No. 210 at 21, ignores the \n27  conditions discussed in Section III.B.ii above.  Section 2808 has limits.  It may only be invoked in \n28  the event of war or a national emergency, and the Secretary of Defense still must establish that the \n35 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 36 of 47\n \n1  proposal is a military construction project necessary to support the use of the armed forces. \n2  This does not, however, end the inquiry.  To be sure, had Defendants acted within their \n3  authority under Section 2808 in proposing the eleven border barrier construction projects, the \n4  Court finds that their conduct likely would not violate NEPA.  But the Court has already found \n5  that Defendants have not properly invoked Section 2808, so that the “without regard to any other \n6  provision of law” language is not triggered.  Put another way, the question of whether Defendants \n7  are required to comply with NEPA with respect to the eleven projects is derivative of the parties’ \n8  Section 2808 arguments.  The Court does not understand Defendants to suggest that any authority \n9  other than Section 2808 excuses them from complying with NEPA as to these projects.  The Court \n10  thus need not reach whether a proper invocation of Section 2808 could theoretically still require \n11  compliance with NEPA under different circumstances.15 \n12 \na  E.  Injunctive Relief \ntr in\nuoro 13  Having found that Defendants’ intended use of military construction funds under Section \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  2808 is unlawful, the Court next considers Plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief.  It is a well-\ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  established principle of equity that a permanent injunction is appropriate when:  (1) a plaintiff will \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  “suffer[ ] an irreparable injury” absent an injunction; (2) available remedies at law are \nS d nr\nee 17  “inadequate;” (3) the “balance of hardships” between the parties supports an equitable remedy; \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  and (4) the public interest is “not disserved.”  eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, LLC, 547 U.S. 388, 391 \n19  (2006).  Defendants do not challenge whether the available remedies at law are inadequate.  See, \n20  e.g., Sierra Club, No. 19-cv-00892-HSG, Dkt. No. 236 at 28–34.  The Court thus addresses the \n21  remaining factors. \n22  i.  Irreparable Injury \n23  The State Plaintiffs identify several theories of irreparable injury that will occur in the \n24  absence of an injunction, including environmental and financial harm, as well as harm to their \n25 \n                                                 \n15 State Plaintiffs appear to seek reconsideration of the Court’s prior order regarding whether \n26 \nDefendants violated NEPA for purposes of Section 8005 and 10 U.S.C. § 284.  See California, \nNo. 19-cv-00872-HSG, Dkt. No. 220, at 5, 19–20, & n.3.  State Plaintiffs acknowledge that they \n27 \ndo so to preserve this issue for appeal.  Id. at 5, n.3.  The Court declines to reconsider its prior \norder given Plaintiffs have failed to provide any new law or factual evidence warranting further \n28 \nanalysis. \n36 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 37 of 47\n \n1  ability to enforce state laws concerning the protection of environmental and natural resources.  The \n2  Sierra Club Plaintiffs, in turn, identify aesthetic and recreational harm, as well as organizational \n3  harm to their missions in diverting resources to respond to Defendants’ proposed projects.  The \n4  Court recognizes that these injuries are distinct, and first addresses the Sierra Club Plaintiffs’ \n5  alleged injuries.  Because, as explained more fully below, the Court finds that Sierra Club \n6  Plaintiffs have established that a permanent injunction is warranted as to all eleven proposed \n7  projects, the Court denies State Plaintiffs’ duplicative request for a permanent injunction as moot. \n8  a.  Aesthetic and Recreational Harm \n9  Sierra Club Plaintiffs contend that absent a permanent injunction Defendants’ conduct will \n10  irreparably harm their members’ aesthetic and recreational interests as the construction “will \n11  impede [their] ability to enjoy, work, and create in the wilderness areas they have used for years \n12  along the U.S.-Mexico border.”  See Sierra Club, 19-cv-00892-HSG, Dkt. No. 210 at 26.  As this \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Court has previously noted, “it is well-established in the Ninth Circuit that an organization can \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  demonstrate irreparable harm by showing that the challenged action will injure its members’ \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  enjoyment of public land.  See id., Dkt. No. 144 at 49 (citing All. for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  632 F.3d 1127, 1135 (9th Cir. 2011)).  And here, Plaintiffs provide declarations from their \nS d nr\nee 17  members detailing how Defendants’ eleven proposed border barrier construction projects will \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  harm their ability to recreate in and otherwise enjoy public land along the border.  See, e.g., id., \n19  Dkt. No. 210-1, Exs. 1–19. \n20  In response, Defendants attempt to minimize Plaintiffs’ injuries by arguing that many of \n21  the challenged construction projects are surrounded by private land or are in areas previously \n22  disturbed by at least some border barrier construction.  See id., Dkt. Nos. 236 at 28–31, 236-6, Ex. \n23  6.  Defendants further suggest that any access limitations imposed by the new construction would \n24  be de minimis, especially as to the two projects on the Barry M. Goldwater Range, where only a \n25  third of the miles scheduled for construction are accessible to the public.  See id., Dkt. No. 236 at \n26  30.  Defendants conclude that Plaintiffs’ asserted harm is thus little more than their subjective \n27  opinion about whether a border wall would be unsightly.  Id.  The Court is not persuaded. \n28  As an initial matter, the Ninth Circuit has “never required a plaintiff to show that he has a \n37 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 38 of 47\n \n1  right of access to the site on which the challenged activity is occurring, or that he has an absolute \n2  right to enjoy the aesthetic or recreational activities that form the basis of his concrete interest.”  \n3  Cantrell v. City of Long Beach, 241 F.3d 674, 681 (9th Cir. 2001).  In Cantrell, for example, the \n4  Ninth Circuit credited birdwatchers’ allegations that they would suffer harm from the defendant’s \n5  construction, which would hinder them from viewing birds and nests on a naval station from \n6  publicly accessible locations.  Such an approach is sensible as “an area can be observed and \n7  enjoyed from adjacent land,” such that plaintiffs may still suffer injury to their aesthetic and \n8  recreational interests even when not physically on the affected land.  See id.  Here too, Plaintiffs \n9  have explained that the proposed projects may be seen from miles away, and affect their \n10  recreational and aesthetic interests, even when they are not standing directly on the areas proposed \n11  for construction.  See, e.g., Sierra Club, 19-cv-00892-HSG, Dkt. No. 210-1, Ex. 4; id., Ex. 9.   \n12  Defendants’ reliance on Center for Food Safety v. Vilsack does not undermine the \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  significance of Plaintiffs’ injury.  Defendants point to a sentence in a footnote that states “a \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  plaintiff may establish standing to seek injunctive relief yet fail to show the likelihood of \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  irreparable harm necessary to obtain it.”  636 F.3d 1166, 1171, n.6 (9th Cir. 2011).  This point is \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  true as far as it goes, but the plaintiffs in Vilsack had only raised possible concerns about genetic \nS d nr\nee 17  contamination, not a likelihood of injury.  Id. at 1173.  In Vilsack, the plaintiffs suggested that the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  defendants’ genetically modified sugar beets could cross-pollinate with their crops, causing injury.  \n19  See id. at 1172.  The Ninth Circuit explained that the undisputed evidence, however, indicated that \n20  the defendants’ plants were “biologically incapable of flowering or cross-pollinating” in a way \n21  that could affect the plaintiffs’ plants.  Id. at 1173.  Because the alleged harm was a biological \n22  impossibility, the Ninth Circuit found that there was no likelihood of irreparable injury warranting \n23  an injunction. \n24  Here, in contrast, Plaintiffs have detailed the harm that would result if the border barrier \n25  construction projects continue.  Defendants’ argument in response is that the land for the \n26  challenged projects “is  already heavily disturbed with border infrastructure” as much of the land \n27  occupies existing “law enforcement corridors.”  Sierra Club, 19-cv-00892-HSG, Dkt. No. 236 at \n28  28.  But as the Court has previously explained, Defendants’ proposal would significantly alter the \n38 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 39 of 47\n \n1  existing landscape, and even the proposed changes to the existing infrastructure are substantial.  \n2  See id., Dkt. No. 144 at 50. \n3  The Court is also not persuaded that the preexistence of some construction means Plaintiffs \n4  here cannot suffer an injury from additional construction.  Defendants do not cite a case that \n5  warrants such a sweeping limitation.  In Gallatin Wildlife Association v. U.S. Forest Services, the \n6  plaintiffs sought to enjoin sheep grazing that had occurred for the past 150 years.  See No. cv 15-\n7  27-BU-BMM, 2015 WL 4528611, at *4 (D. Mont. July 27, 2015).  The court found that the \n8  plaintiffs had “failed to demonstrate that allowing the domestic grazing to occur this year will \n9  cause any new harm to the landscape that has not already occurred in the past 150 years.”  Id.  \n10  That the sheep had grazed in the area before was not itself decisive; instead, the court considered \n11  the nature and scale of their continued and additive effect on the land at issue.  And in Center for \n12  Biological Diversity v. Hays, the court found that the plaintiffs had not established irreparable \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  injury where the land at issue could not be used for recreational purposes at all due to the scale of \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  preexisting dead trees that threatened the safety of visitors.  No. 2:15-cv-01627-TLN-CMK, 2015 \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  WL 5916739, at *1, *10 (E.D. Cal. Oct. 8, 2015).  The plaintiff’s interest in studying these trees \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  was thus irrelevant as he could not access them regardless of the defendant’s conduct.  Id. \nS d nr\nee 17  In sum, the Court finds that the funding and construction of these border barrier projects, if \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  indeed barred by law, cannot be easily remedied after the fact.  To the contrary, as the Ninth \n19  Circuit has acknowledged, “[t]he harm here, as with many instances of this kind of harm, is \n20  irreparable for the purposes of the preliminary injunction analysis.”  See League of Wilderness \n21  Defenders/Blue Mountains Biodiversity Project v. Connaughton, 752 F.3d 755, 764 (9th Cir. \n22  2014).  Accordingly, the Court finds that Sierra Club Plaintiffs have established irreparable injury \n23  to their aesthetic and recreational interests in the absence of a permanent injunction. \n24  b.  Organizational Harm \n25  Sierra Club Plaintiffs further contend that Defendants’ conduct has irreparably harmed the \n26  missions and activities of the Southern Border Communities Coalition (“SBCC”) and its member \n27  organizations, which include the Texas Civil Rights Project (“TCRP”), Southwest Environmental \n28  Center (“SWEC”), and American Friends Service Committee (“AFSC”).  Each has had to divert \n39 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 40 of 47\n \n1  resources to combat the impact of the proposed construction. \n2  The Supreme Court has recognized that an organization may suffer harm if the challenged \n3  conduct frustrates its activities and drains its resources.  See, e.g., Havens Realty Corp. v. \n4  Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 377–79 (1982).  In Havens Reality, a nonprofit corporation challenged the \n5  defendants’ alleged “racial steering” practices, in which real estate brokers encouraged racial \n6  segregation by directing members of racial or ethnic  groups to buildings or neighborhoods \n7  occupied primarily by members of the same race of ethnic group.  Id. at 367, & n.1.  The \n8  organization’s “purpose was to make equal opportunity in housing a reality . . . .”  Id. at 368 \n9  (quotation omitted).  The Supreme Court explained that the organization’s need to divert resources \n10  “to identify and counteract” the defendants’ discriminatory practices “constitute[d] far more than \n11  simply a setback to the organization’s abstract social interests” in equal access to housing.  See id. \n12  at 379–80.  Similarly, in National Council of La Raza v. Cegavske, the Ninth Circuit further \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  recognized that an organization may establish concrete harm if the defendant’s conduct changes \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  “business as usual” for the organization, such that resources spent to counter a defendant’s \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  conduct “would have [been] spent on some other aspect of their organizational purpose . . . or any \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  other activity that advances their goals.”  800 F.3d 1032, 1040 (9th Cir. 2015) (quotation omitted).  \nS d nr\nee 17  In Cegavske, the Ninth Circuit acknowledged that had the state complied with the National Voter \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Registration Act, the organization could have spent its resources elsewhere, such as increasing its \n19  voter education efforts, rather than on voter registration drives in communities where the \n20  defendant should have offered voter registration opportunities.  Id.; accord Fair Hous. Council of \n21  San Fernando Valley v. Roommate.com, LLC, 666 F.3d 1216, 1219 (9th Cir. 2012). \n22  That is precisely what Plaintiffs have established here, as Defendants’ conduct has \n23  significantly altered “business as usual” for the Plaintiff organizations, and will continue to do so \n24  without a permanent injunction: \n25  •  SBCC’s “principal goals are to protect human rights, dignity, and safety” in the \n26  border regions of the United States.  Sierra Club, No. 19-cv-00892-HSG, Dkt. \n27  No. 210-1, Ex. 7 at 41–46.  SBCC has spent considerable time and resources \n28  advocating against appropriations for border barrier construction and in urging \n40 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 41 of 47\n \n1  Congress to terminate the national emergency.  As a result, SBCC has diverted \n2  time and resources away from its “other initiatives, including Border Patrol \n3  accountability, community engagement on local health and education issues, \n4  and public education about immigration policies more broadly.”  Id. at 45. \n5  •  TCRP has diverted resources to protect Texas landowners in Laredo who are at \n6  risk of having their non-public property condemned for the border barrier \n7  construction projects, id., Ex. 6 at 35–39.  They have staged events to educate \n8  communities about these projects and their rights, are working to create a \n9  network of advocates for this work.  Because of this work, TCRP has had to \n10  divert time and resources away from their other projects to protect border \n11  communities outside of Laredo. \n12  •  SWEC’s mission is to “reverse the accelerating loss of plants and animals \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  worldwide through protection and restoration of native wildlife and their \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  habitats in the southwest.”  Id., Ex. 3 at 16–17.  Though based in New Mexico, \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  its restoration and education work extends into Eastern Arizona and West \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Texas.  However, in light of the proposed border barrier projects, SWEC has \nS d nr\nee 17  significantly reduced its restoration work to divert resources to monitor \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  construction and educate members and the public about the proposed \n19  construction and its likely impact. \n20  •  AFSC works with migrant communities in San Diego and El Centro to \n21  document abuses by law enforcement and collaborate with community groups \n22  to address local issues.  Id., Ex. 13 at 74–75.  However, if the border barrier \n23  projects in these areas proceed, they will have to decrease the time and \n24  resources they spend on their other services, including know-your-rights \n25  trainings and leadership development courses, so they can monitor the \n26  construction and provide outreach resources to the affected communities. \n27  Defendants counter that Plaintiffs’ missions as public advocacy groups have not been \n28  injured, and more critically still, that Plaintiffs have not established any nexus between their injury \n41 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 42 of 47\n \n1  and Defendants’ conduct.  Defendants first contend that the organizations may continue their \n2  advocacy work in the face of the border barrier projects, but as the Ninth Circuit recognized in \n3  Cegavske, it is enough that these organizations “would have spent [resources] on some other \n4  aspect of their organizational purpose . . . or any other activity that advances their goals,” in the \n5  absence of the border barrier construction projects.  See 800 F.3d at 1040.  Here, the Plaintiff \n6  organizations have spent resources creating new education, outreach, and monitoring programs \n7  related to the construction projects, rather than on other activities related to their respective \n8  missions.  Defendants’ suggestion that there is no nexus between Plaintiffs’ harm and Defendants’ \n9  conduct is similarly unavailing.  The organizations work in and with border communities to \n10  protect and restore the environment, as is the case with SWEC, and promote the safety of border \n11  communities, as is the case with SBCC, TCRP, and AFSC.  But because the organizations believe \n12  the border barrier projects impede these respective missions, they have altered “business as usual” \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  to combat these projects and educate others about them.  Defendants’ blanket conclusion that the \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  border barrier construction projects “in no way impede or disrupt their day-to-day activities,” \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Sierra Club, No. 19-cv-00892-HSG, Dkt. No. 247 at 24, simply is not supported by the record.  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  The Court finds that Sierra Club Plaintiffs have thus established irreparable injury to their \nS d nr\nee 17  organizational missions in the absence of a permanent injunction. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  i.  Balance of Equities and Public Interest \n19  The parties all acknowledge that when the government is a party to a case in which a \n20  preliminary injunction is sought, the balance of the equities and public interest factors merge.  See \n21  Drakes Bay Oyster Co. v. Jewell, 747 F.3d 1073, 1092 (9th Cir. 2014).  And in these cases, the \n22  parties’ asserted injuries collapse into the equities they assert. \n23  According to Defendants, these factors tilt in their favor, because they have “compelling \n24  interests in safety and in the integrity of our borders,” and “in ensuring that [the country’s] \n25  military forces are properly supported and have the necessary resources to ensure mission \n26  success.”  See Sierra Club, No. 19-cv-00892-HSG, Dkt. No. 236 at 33.  As the Court has \n27  previously acknowledged, “the public has a ‘weighty’ interest ‘in efficient administration of the \n28  immigration laws at the border.’”  See E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, 932 F.3d 742, 779 \n42 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 43 of 47\n \n1  (9th Cir. 2018) (quoting Landon v. Plasencia, 459 U.S. 21, 34 (1982)). \n2  Yet Defendants’ argument again fails to recognize that Congress has already engaged in \n3  the difficult balancing of Defendants’ proffered interests and the need for border barrier \n4  construction in passing the CAA.  See CAA, § 230(a)(1), 133 Stat. 13.  Defendants have not \n5  pointed to any factual developments that were not before Congress and that may have altered its \n6  judgment to appropriate just $1.375 billion in funding for limited border barrier construction.  The \n7  Court appreciates the complexity of the policy judgments at hand, and further understands that \n8  Defendants may strongly disagree with Congress’ determination.  But the Court has found that \n9  Defendants do not have the statutory authority under Section 2808 to redirect military construction \n10  funds for the planned border barrier construction.  And as such, Defendants have not identified a \n11  mechanism by which they may override Congress’ appropriations judgment.  As the Court \n12  explained in its orders related to Section 8005, “Defendants’ position on these factors boils down \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  to an argument that the Court should not enjoin conduct found to be unlawful because the ends \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  justify the means.  No case supports this principle.”  See Sierra Club, 19-cv-00892-HSG, Dkt. No. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  185 at 8.  The Court finds that “the public [] has an interest in ensuring that statutes enacted by \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  their representatives are not imperiled by executive fiat,” E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant, 932 F3d at \nS d nr\nee 17  779, and that these constitutional separation of powers principles outweigh Defendants’ concerns \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  about the efficiency of DHS.  Accordingly, the Court follows the Ninth Circuit’s reasoning that \n19  the public interest “is best served by respecting the Constitution’s assignment of the power of the \n20  purse to Congress, and by deferring to Congress’s understanding of the public interest as reflected \n21  in its repeated denial of more funding for border barrier construction.”  Sierra Club, 929 F.3d at \n22  677. \n23  In his concurrence in the landmark 1952 case of Youngstown Sheet and Tube Co. v. \n24  Sawyer, which addressed the scope of executive power during a time of war on the Korean \n25  Peninsula, Justice Frankfurter articulated a principle that remains as important today as it was \n26  then: \nIt is one thing to draw an intention of Congress from general language \n27  and  to  say  that  Congress  would  have  explicitly  written  what  is \ninferred,  where  Congress  has  not  addressed  itself  to  a  specific \n28  situation.    It  is  quite  impossible,  however,  when  Congress  did \n43 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 44 of 47\n \nspecifically address itself to a problem, as Congress did to that of \n1  seizure  [of  steel  mills  by  the  President],  to  find  secreted  in  the \ninterstices of legislation the very grant of power which Congress \n2  consciously withheld.  To find authority so explicitly withheld is not \nmerely to disregard in a particular instance the clear will of Congress.  \n3  It is to disrespect the whole legislative process and the constitutional \ndivision of authority between President and Congress. \n4 \n5   343 U.S. 579, 610 (Frankfurter, J., concurring). \n6  After a lengthy legislative process, Congress specifically declined to provide the funding \n7  sought by the Executive for the border barrier construction at issue in this case.  The Executive has \n8  made plain its determination to nonetheless proceed with the construction by any means necessary, \n9  notwithstanding Congress’ contrary exercise of its constitutionally-absolute power of the purse.  \n10  As Justice Frankfurter explained long ago, that position both disregards the clear will of Congress \n11  and disrespects the whole legislative process and the separation of powers enshrined in the \n12  Constitution.  Because the Court finds Defendants’ proposed use of funds under Section 2808 \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  unlawful, the Court finds that the balance of hardships and public interest favor Plaintiffs, and \nCfi\n tclaC 14  counsel in favor of a permanent injunction.16 \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  IV.  STAY PENDING APPEAL \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62(c) authorizes a district court to stay enforcement of a \nS d nr\nee 17  permanent injunction pending appeal.  See Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776 (1987).  “A \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  stay is not a matter of right, even if irreparable injury might otherwise result.”  Nken v. Holder, \n19  556 U.S. 418, 427 (2009) (quotation omitted).  Rather, the decision to grant or deny a stay is \n20  committed to the district court’s discretion.  Id.  In determining whether to issue a stay, a court \n21  examines several factors including:  (1) whether the applicant has made a strong showing that he is \n22  likely to succeed on the merits of the appeal; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured \n23  absent a stay; (3) whether a stay will substantially injure the non-moving party; and (4) where the \n24  public interest lies.  See Leiva-Perez v. Holder, 640 F.3d 962, 964 (9th Cir. 2011). \n25 \n                                                 \n16 The Court further notes that on December 10, 2019, the United States District Court for the \n26 \nWestern District of Texas also entered an order permanently enjoining “agency head Defendants \nMark T. Esper, Chad F. Wilf, Todd, T. Semonite, David Bernhardt, and Steven T. Mnuchin . . . \n27 \nfrom using § 2808 funds beyond the $1.375 billion in the 2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act \nfor border wall construction.”  See El Paso County v. Trump, No. 3:19-cv-0066-DB (W.D. Tex.), \n28 \nDkt. No. 136 at 21. \n44 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 45 of 47\n \n1  Although the Court has considered similar factors as part of its permanent injunction \n2  analysis above, the Supreme Court’s stay of this Court’s prior injunction order appears to reflect \n3  the conclusion of a majority of that Court that the challenged construction should be permitted to \n4  proceed pending resolution of the merits.  Accordingly, the Court finds in its discretion that the \n5  lengthy history of this action; the prior appellate record; and the pending appeal before the Ninth \n6  Circuit on the merits of Plaintiffs’ Section 8005 claim, which will address several of the threshold \n7  legal and factual issues raised in this order, warrant a stay of the permanent injunction pending \n8  appeal.  Plaintiffs may, of course, petition the Ninth Circuit to lift this stay. \n9  V.  CERTIFICATION FOR APPEAL \n10  Given the parties’ express request to certify for appeal the Court’s prior orders regarding \n11  Section 8005, the Court also considers whether certification is appropriate here.  Appellate courts \n12  generally only have jurisdiction to hear appeals from final orders.  See 28 U.S.C. § 1291.  Federal \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) allows for a narrow exception to this final judgment rule, permitting \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  courts to “direct entry of a final judgment as to one or more, but fewer than all, claims or parties \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  only if the court expressly determines that there is no just reason for delay.”  Entry of judgment \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  under Rule 54(b) thus requires:  (1) a final judgment; and (2) a determination that there is no just \nS d nr\nee 17  reason for delay of entry.  See Pakootas v. Teck Cominco Metals, Ltd., 905 F.3d 565, 574 (9th Cir. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  2018) (quoting Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. Gen. Elec. Co., 446 U.S. 1, 7–8 (1980)).  The Court finds \n19  both requirements satisfied here. \n20  A.  Finality of Judgment \n21  A final judgment is “a decision upon a cognizable claim for relief” that is “an ultimate \n22  disposition of an individual claim entered in the course of a multiple claims action.”  Curtiss-\n23  Wright Corp., 446 U.S. at 7.  The Court finds this requirement satisfied because the Court’s award \n24  of partial summary judgment in this order is “an ultimate disposition” of Plaintiffs’ claims related \n25  to Defendants’ purported reliance on Section 2808 for border barrier construction. \n26  B.  No Just Reason for Delay \n27  As the Ninth Circuit has explained, “[j]udgments under Rule 54(b) must be reserved for \n28  the unusual case in which the costs and risks of multiplying the number of proceedings and of \n45 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 46 of 47\n \n1  overcrowding the appellate docket are outbalanced by pressing needs of the litigants for an early \n2  and separate judgment as to some claims or parties.”  Morrison-Knudsen Co. v. Archer, 655 F.2d \n3  962, 965 (9th Cir. 1981).  Accordingly, an explanation of findings “should include a determination \n4  whether, upon any review of the judgment entered under the rule, the appellate court will be \n5  required to address legal or factual issues that are similar to those contained in the claims still \n6  pending before the trial court.”  Id. at 965.  “The greater the overlap the greater the chance that \n7  [the Court of Appeals] will have to revisit the same facts—spun only slightly differently—in a \n8  successive appeal.”  Wood v. GCC Bend, LLC, 422 F.3d 873, 882 (9th Cir. 2005).  “[P]lainly, \n9  sound judicial administration does not require that Rule 54(b) requests be granted routinely.”  Id. \n10  at 879 (quotation omitted).  \n11  As with its partial summary judgment order related to Section 8005, the Court finds there \n12  is no just reason for delay under the circumstances.  Whether Defendants’ actions comport with \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  the statutory requirements of Section 2808 and whether Defendants’ actions comport with the \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  remaining statutory requirements related to the outstanding claims are distinct inquiries, largely \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  based on distinct law.  The Court therefore finds that “sound judicial administration” is best served \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  by the Court certifying this judgment for appeal, in light of the undisputedly significant interests at \nS d nr\nee 17  stake in this case.  See Wood, 422 F.3d at 879. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  VI.  CONCLUSION \n19  For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART \n20  Plaintiffs’ motions for partial summary judgment and DENIES Defendants’ motions for partial \n21  summary judgment.  Specifically, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ request for declaratory judgment \n22  that Defendants’ intended use of military construction funds under Section 2808 for the eleven \n23  border barrier construction projects that the Secretary of Defense identified as Yuma Project 2; \n24  Yuma Project 10/27; Yuma Project 3; Yuma Project 6; San Diego Project 4; San Diego Project 11; \n25  El Paso Project 2; El Paso Project 8; Laredo Project 5; Laredo Project 7; El Centro Project 5; and \n26  El Centro Project 9, is unlawful.  See Sierra Club, No. 19-cv-00892-HSG, Dkt. Nos. 201, 201-1, \n27  & Ex. 1.  The Court DENIES Plaintiffs’ request for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief \n28  concerning Defendants’ (1) invocation of Section 2808 beyond these projects; (2) reliance on \n46 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 258   Filed 12/11/19   Page 47 of 47\n1  Section 2808 to excuse them from complying with NEPA as to the eleven proposed projects; and \n2  (3)decision to defer outstanding military construction projects.\n3  The terms of the permanent injunction are as follows:  Defendants Mark T. Esper, in his \n4  official capacity as Secretary of Defense; and Chad F. Wolf, in his official capacity as Acting \n5  Secretary of Homeland Security (collectively, “Defendants”), and all persons acting under their \n6  direction, are permanently enjoined from using military construction funds appropriated for other \n7  purposes to build a border wall in the areas Defendants have identified as Yuma Project 2; Yuma \n8  Project 10/27; Yuma Project 3; Yuma Project 6; San Diego Project 4; San Diego Project 11; El \n9  Paso Project 2; El Paso Project 8; Laredo Project 5; Laredo Project 7; El Centro Project 5; and El \n10  Centro Project 9.  Nevertheless, as discussed in Section IV above, the Court exercises its \n11  discretion to STAY the permanent injunction pending appeal. \n12  The Clerk is directed to enter final judgment in favor of Plaintiffs and against Defendants \na \nrt ni\nouor 13  with respect to Defendants’ purported reliance on Section 2808 to fund border barrier \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  construction.  This judgment will be certified for immediate appeal pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  IT IS SO ORDERED. \nd Srn \nee 17  Dated:  12/11/2019 \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  ______________________________________ \nHAYWOOD S.

The only issue presently before the Court concerns \n21  Defendants’ intended reprogramming of funds under Sections 8005 and 9002 of the Department of \n22  Defense Appropriations Act, 2019, Pub. L. No. 115-245, 132 Stat. 2981 (2018), and subsequent \n23  use of such funds under 10 U.S.C. § 284 (“Section 284”) for border barrier construction.3   \n24 \n                                                 \n25 \n1 Acting Secretary Esper is automatically substituted for former Acting Secretary Patrick M. \nShanaham.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(d). \n26 \n2 Acting Secretary McAleenan is automatically substituted for former Secretary Kirstjen M. \nNielsen.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(d). \n27 \n3 The relevant background for this motion is essentially unchanged since the Court’s preliminary \ninjunction order.  The Court thus incorporates in full here the factual background and statutory \n28 \nframework as set forth in that order.  See Dkt. No. 144. \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 185   Filed 06/28/19   Page 2 of 11\n \n1  After carefully considering the parties’ arguments, the Court GRANTS IN PART and \n2  DENIES IN PART Plaintiffs’ motion, and DENIES Defendants’ motion.4  The Court also \n3  certifies this judgment for immediate appeal pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil \n4  Procedure.  Last, the Court DENIES Defendants’ request for a stay of any injunction pending \n5  appeal. \n6  I.  LEGAL STANDARD \n7  Summary judgment is proper when a “movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to \n8  any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  \n9  A fact is “material” if it “might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.”  Anderson \n10  v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).  And a dispute is “genuine” if there is evidence \n11  in the record sufficient for a reasonable trier of fact to decide in favor of the nonmoving party.  Id.  \n12  But in deciding if a dispute is genuine, the court must view the inferences reasonably drawn from \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  the materials in the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,  Matsushita Elec. \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587–88 (1986), and “may not weigh the evidence \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  or make credibility determinations,” Freeman v. Arpaio, 125 F.3d 732, 735 (9th Cir. 1997), \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  overruled on other grounds by Shakur v. Schriro, 514 F.3d 878, 884–85 (9th Cir. 2008).  If a court \nS d nr\nee 17  finds that there is no genuine dispute of material fact as to only a single claim or defense or as to \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  part of a claim or defense, it may enter partial summary judgment.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). \n19  The parties agree that the issue presently before the Court is properly resolved on their \n20  cross-motions for partial summary judgment.  Pls.’ Mot. at 8–9; Defs.’ Mot. at 9.   \n21  II.  DISCUSSION \n22  In their motion, Plaintiffs request that the Court (1) enter final judgment in their favor \n23  “declaring unlawful Defendants’ transfer of Fiscal Year 2019 appropriated funds to the \n24  Department of Defense’s [(“DoD’s”)] Section 284 account, the use of those funds for construction \n25  of a border wall, and Defendants’ failure to comply with NEPA for this construction”; (2) issue a \n26 \n                                                 \n27 \n4 In light of the extended oral argument regarding these issues at the preliminary injunction \nhearing, see Dkt. No. 138, the Court finds these matters appropriate for disposition without oral \n28 \nargument and the matters are deemed submitted, see Civil L.R. 7-1(b). \n2 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 185   Filed 06/28/19   Page 3 of 11\n \n1  permanent injunction prohibiting Defendants from so funding border barrier construction “prior to \n2  complying with NEPA”; and (3) enjoin such unlawful use of funds generally.  Pls.’ Mot. at 1.  \n3  Defendants’ motion seeks a final determination that their intended use of funds under Sections \n4  8005, 9002, and 284 for border barrier construction is lawful.  Defs.’ Mot. at 2.  Defendants also \n5  request that the Court certify this judgment for appeal under Rule 54(b).  Id. at 24–25. \n6  A.  Declaratory Relief \n7  Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment finding unlawful Defendants’ (1) reprogramming of \n8  funds under Sections 8005 and 9002, (2) use of those funds for border barrier construction under \n9  Section 284, and (3) failure to comply with NEPA before pursuing any such construction.  See \n10  Pls.’ Mot. at 1. \n11  1.  Sections 8005, 9002, and 284 \n12  Starting with Section 8005, the Court previously held that Plaintiffs were likely to succeed \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  on their arguments that Defendants’ intended reprogramming of funds under Section 8005 to the \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Section 284 account to fund border barrier construction in El Paso Sector 1 and Yuma Sector 1 is \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  unlawful.  In particular, the Court found that Plaintiffs were likely to show that (1) the item for \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  which funds are requested has been denied by Congress; (2) the transfer is not based on \nS d nr\nee 17  “unforeseen military requirements”; and (3) accepting Defendants’ proposed interpretation of \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Section 8005’s requirements would raise serious constitutional questions.5  Dkt. No. 144 (“PI \n19  Order”) at 31–42. \n20  The Court previously only considered Defendants’ reprogramming and subsequent use of \n21  funds for border barrier construction for El Paso Sector Project 1 and Yuma Sector Project 1.  It \n22  did not consider Defendants’ more-recently announced reprogramming and subsequent diversion \n23  of funds for border barrier construction for the El Centro Sector Project and Tucson Sector \n24  Projects 1–3, pending further development of the record as to those projects.  See id. at 12.  To \n25  fund these projects, Defendants again invoked Section 8005, as well as DoD’s “special transfer \n26 \n                                                 \n5 The Court did not consider whether Defendants’ reprogramming of funds was for a “higher \n27 \npriority item”—an independently necessary requirement under Section 8005—because \nDefendants’ planned use of such reprogrammed funds failed multiple other Section 8005 \n28 \nrequirements.  The Court similarly does not consider the “higher priority item” requirement here. \n3 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 185   Filed 06/28/19   Page 4 of 11\n \n1  authority under section 9002 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2019, and section \n2  1512 of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019.”  See Dkt. \n3  No. 118-1 (“Rapuano Second Decl.”) ¶ 7.  Defendants’ Section 9002 authority, however, is \n4  subject to Section 8005’s limitations.  See Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2019, Pub. \n5  L. No. 115-245, § 9002, 132 Stat. 2981, 3042 (2018) (providing that “the authority provided in \n6  this section is in addition to any other transfer authority available to the Department of Defense \n7  and is subject to the same terms and conditions as the authority provided in section 8005 of this \n8  Act”); see also Defs.’ Mot. at 10 n.4 (acknowledging that Section 9002 is subject to Section \n9  8005’s requirements).  Because Defendants agree that all such authority is subject to Section \n10  8005’s substantive requirements, the Court refers to these requirements collectively by reference \n11  to Section 8005.   \n12  In their pending motion, “Defendants acknowledge that the Court previously rejected \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  [their] arguments about the proper interpretation of § 8005 in its [preliminary injunction] order.”  \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Defs.’ Mot. at 10.  Defendants contend that the Court’s findings were wrong for two reasons: (1) \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  “Plaintiffs fall outside the zone of interests of § 8005 and thus cannot sue to enforce it”; and (2) \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  “DoD has satisfied the requirements set forth in § 8005.”  Id. at 10–13.  But Defendants here offer \nS d nr\nee 17  no evidence or argument that was not already considered in the Court’s preliminary injunction \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  order.  For example, Defendants continue to argue that under Lexmark International, Inc. v. Static \n19  Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118 (2014), the zone-of-interests test applies to Plaintiffs’ \n20  claims.  Compare Opp. at 10, with Dkt. No. 64 at 14–15.  And the Court continues to find that the \n21  test has no application in an ultra vires challenge, which operates outside of the APA framework, \n22  and the Court incorporates here its prior reasoning on this point.  PI Order at 29–30.   \n23  Defendants also continue to assert that DoD did not transfer funds for an item previously \n24  denied by Congress and that the transfer was for an “unforeseen” requirement.  Compare Opp. at \n25  11–13, with Dkt. No. 64 at 16–18.  But Defendants again present no new evidence or argument for \n26  why the Court should depart from its prior decision, and it will not.  The Court thus stands by its \n27  prior finding that Defendants’ proposed interpretation of the statute is unreasonable, and agrees \n28  with Plaintiffs that Defendants’ intended reprogramming of funds under Section 8005—and \n4 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 185   Filed 06/28/19   Page 5 of 11\n \n1  necessarily under Section 9002 as well—to the Section 284 account for border barrier construction \n2  is unlawful.  See PI Order at 31–42.  Because no new factual or legal arguments persuade the \n3  Court that its analysis in the preliminary injunction order was wrong, Plaintiffs’ likelihood of \n4  success on the merits has ripened into actual success.  The Court accordingly GRANTS Plaintiffs’ \n5  request for declaratory judgment that such use of funds reprogrammed under Sections 8005 and \n6  9002 for El Paso Sector Project 1, Yuma Sector Project 1, El Centro Sector Project, and Tucson \n7  Sector Projects 1–3 is unlawful.6 \n8  Turning to Section 284, the Court finds that it need not determine whether Plaintiffs are \n9  entitled to declaratory judgment that Defendants’ invocation of Section 284 is also unlawful.  \n10  When a party requests declaratory judgment, “the question in each case is whether the facts \n11  alleged, under all the circumstances, show that there is a substantial controversy, between parties \n12  having adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  declaratory judgment.”  Md. Cas. Co. v. Pac. Coal & Oil Co., 312 U.S. 270, 273 (1941).  Having \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  determined that Defendants’ proposed reprogramming of funds under Sections 8005 and 9002 is \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  unlawful, no immediate adverse legal interests warrant a declaratory judgment concerning Section \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  284.  Defendants acknowledge that all of the money they plan to spend on border barrier \nS d nr\nee 17  construction under Section 284 is money transferred into the relevant account under Sections 8005 \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  and 9002.  See Dkt. No. 131 at 4.  Given this acknowledgment, the Court’s ruling as to Sections \n19  8005 and 9002 obviates the need to independently assess the lawfulness of Defendants’ invocation \n20  of Section 284. \n21  2.  NEPA \n22  Separate and apart from whether Defendants’ invocations of Sections 8005, 9002, and 284 \n23  to fund border barrier construction conform with respective statutory requirements, Plaintiffs seek \n24  a declaratory judgment deeming unlawful Defendants’ failure to comply with NEPA before \n25  pursuing such construction.  See, e.g., Pls.’ Mot. at 24.  Plaintiffs acknowledge that they present \n26 \n                                                 \n6 Plaintiffs’ motion seeks a broader declaratory judgment that any use of reprogrammed funds for \n27 \nborder barrier construction, even outside of these particular sectors, is unlawful.  See Mot. at 23–\n24.  Given that Defendants have not yet authorized any border barrier construction outside of the \n28 \ncontested sectors, the Court declines to issue such a declaratory judgment. \n5 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 185   Filed 06/28/19   Page 6 of 11\n \n1  identical arguments previously raised and rejected by the Court in its preliminary injunction order.   \n2  See id. at 18 n.3.  Presented with no new evidence or argument that was not already considered in \n3  the Court’s preliminary injunction order, the Court continues to find that the pertinent waivers \n4  issued by DHS are dispositive of the NEPA claims, for the reasons detailed in the Court’s previous \n5  order.  See PI Order at 46–48. \n6  B.  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n7  It is a well-established principle of equity that a permanent injunction is appropriate when: \n8  (1) a plaintiff will “suffer[] an irreparable injury” absent an injunction; (2) available remedies at \n9  law are “inadequate;” (3) the “balance of hardships” between the parties supports an equitable \n10  remedy; and (4) the public interest is “not disserved.”  eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, LLC, 547 U.S. \n11  388, 391 (2006).  Defendants do not dispute that available remedies at law are inadequate.  The \n12  Court thus only considers the remaining factors. \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  1.  Plaintiffs Have Shown They Will Suffer Irreparable Harm Absent a \nCfi\n tla Permanent Injunction. \nciC 14   \nrts fo\niD tc 15  Plaintiffs contend that absent an order permanently enjoining the contemplated border \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  barrier construction in the areas designated El Paso Sector 1, Yuma Sector 1, El Centro Sector, \nS d nr\nee 17  and Tucson Sectors 1–3, its members “will suffer irreparable harm to their recreational and \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  aesthetic interests.”  Mot. at 20–22.  The Court agrees and finds that Plaintiffs have shown that \n19  they will suffer irreparable harm to their members’ aesthetic and recreational interests in the \n20  identified areas absent injunctive relief.  As the Court previously noted, it is well-established in the \n21  Ninth Circuit that an organization can demonstrate irreparable harm by showing that the \n22  challenged action will injure its members’ enjoyment of public land.  See PI Order at 49.  And \n23  Plaintiffs here provide declarations from their members detailing how Defendants’ proposed use \n24  of funds reprogrammed under Sections 8005 and 9002 will harm their ability to recreate in and \n25  otherwise enjoy public land along the border.  See Pls.’ Mot. at 21–22 (citing Dkt. No. 168-1 Ex. 1 \n26  (Bevins Decl.) ¶ 7; id. Ex. 2 (Del Val Decl.) ¶¶ 9–10; id. Ex. 3 (Bixby Decl.) ¶ 6; id. Ex. 4 (Munro \n27  Decl.) ¶¶ 9, 11; id. Ex. 5 (Walsh Decl.) ¶¶ 12, 15; id. Ex. 6 (Evans Decl.) ¶ 8; id. Ex. 7 (Armenta \n28  Decl.) ¶¶ 6–8; id. Ex. 8 (Ramirez Decl.) ¶¶ 5, 8; id. Ex. 9 (Hartmann Decl.) ¶¶ 8, 9; id. Ex. 10 \n6 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 185   Filed 06/28/19   Page 7 of 11\n \n1  (Hudson Decl.) ¶¶ 10–11; id. Ex. 11 (Dahl Decl.) ¶ 8; id. Ex. 13 (Gerrodette Decl.) ¶¶ 6, 8; id. Ex. \n2  14 (Case Decl.) ¶¶ 10–12; id. Ex. 17 (Tuell Decl.) ¶¶ 7, 10; Ex. 18 (Ardovino Decl.) ¶ 6).   \n3  Defendants do not contest the truthfulness of Plaintiffs’ declarants’ assertions that the \n4  challenged border barrier construction will harm their recreational interests.  Defendants instead \n5  contend that Plaintiffs’ alleged recreational harms are insufficient because even with the proposed \n6  border barrier construction, Plaintiffs’ members have plenty of other space to enjoy.  See Defs.’ \n7  Mot. at 21–22.  In their words, border barrier construction “will not impact land uses in the \n8  thousands of acres surrounding the limited project areas, where the forms of recreation Plaintiffs \n9  enjoy will remain possible.”  Id. at 22.  Defendants’ argument—unsupported by any case law—\n10  proves too much.  See All. for Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1135 (9th Cir. 2011) \n11  (holding this argument’s “logical extension is that a plaintiff can never suffer irreparable injury \n12  resulting from environmental harm in [one] area as long as there are other areas [] that are not \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  harmed”).  Given that Plaintiffs’ declarants’ characterization of the harm they will suffer is \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  undisputed as a factual matter, the result under Ninth Circuit law is that Plaintiffs have shown they \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  will suffer irreparable harm absent a permanent injunction.   \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  2.  Balance of Hardships and Public Interest Support a Permanent \nS d nr Injunction \nee 17   \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  The parties agree that the Court should consider the balance of the equities and public \n19  interest factors together, because the government is a party to the case.  See Pls.’ Mot. at 22; Defs.’ \n20  Mot. at 23–24; see also Drakes Bay Oyster Co. v. Jewell, 747 F.3d 1073, 1092 (9th Cir. 2014).  As \n21  they did at the preliminary injunction stage, Defendants here contend that these factors tilt in their \n22  favor because the Government has a strong interest in border security.  Defs.’ Br. at 23.  \n23  Defendants also contend that an injunction would “permanently deprive DoD of its authorization \n24  to use the funds at issue to complete the projects, because the funding will lapse at the end of the \n25  fiscal year” and that DoD will “incur unrecoverable fees and penalties” while construction is \n26  suspended.  Id. at 23–24.   \n27  As the Court explained in its preliminary injunction order, the Ninth Circuit has recognized \n28  that “the public has a ‘weighty’ interest ‘in efficient administration of the immigration laws at the \n7 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 185   Filed 06/28/19   Page 8 of 11\n \n1  border,’” and the Court does not minimize this interest.  See E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, \n2  909 F.3d 1219, 1255 (9th Cir. 2018) (quoting Landon v. Plasencia, 459 U.S. 21, 34 (1982)).  But \n3  “the public also has an interest in ensuring that statutes enacted by their representatives are not \n4  imperiled by executive fiat.”  Id. (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  And the Court \n5  notes that Congress considered all of Defendants’ proffered needs for border barrier construction, \n6  weighed the public interest in such construction against Defendants’ request for taxpayer money, \n7  and struck what it considered to be the proper balance—in the public’s interest—by making \n8  available only $1.375 billion in funding, which was for certain border barrier construction not at \n9  issue here.  See Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019, Pub. L. No. 116-6, § 230(a)(1), 133 \n10  Stat. 13, 28 (2019).  Most important, Defendants overlook that these factors are informed by the \n11  Court’s finding that Defendants do not have the purported statutory authority to reprogram and use \n12  funds for the planned border barrier construction.  Absent such authority, Defendants’ position on \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  these factors boils down to an argument that the Court should not enjoin conduct found to be \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  unlawful because the ends justify the means.  No case supports this principle. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Because the Court finds Defendants’ proposed use of funds reprogrammed under Sections \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  8005 and 9002 unlawful, the Court finds that the balance of hardships and public interest favors \nS d nr\nee 17  Plaintiffs, and counsels in favor of a permanent injunction.   \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  C.  Certification for Appeal \n19  Finally, Defendants request that the Court certify this judgment for appeal under Rule \n20  54(b).  Appellate courts generally only have jurisdiction to hear appeals from final orders.  See 28 \n21  U.S.C. § 1291.  Rule 54(b) allows for a narrow exception to this final judgment rule, permitting \n22  courts to “direct entry of a final judgment as to one or more, but fewer than all, claims or parties \n23  only if the court expressly determines that there is no just reason for delay.”  Entry of judgment \n24  under Rule 54(b) thus requires: (1) a final judgment; and (2) a determination that there is no just \n25  reason for delay of entry.  See Pakootas v. Teck Cominco Metals, Ltd., 905 F.3d 565, 574 (9th Cir. \n26  2018) (quoting Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. Gen. Elec. Co., 446 U.S. 1, 7–8 (1980)). \n27  1.  Finality of Judgment \n28  A final judgment is “a decision upon a cognizable claim for relief” that is “an ultimate \n8 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 185   Filed 06/28/19   Page 9 of 11\n \n1  disposition of an individual claim entered in the course of a multiple claims action.”  Curtiss-\n2  Wright Corp., 446 U.S. at 7 (citing Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Mackey, 351 U.S. 427 (1956)).  The \n3  Court finds this requirement satisfied because the Court’s award of partial summary judgment in \n4  this order is “an ultimate disposition” of Plaintiffs’ claims related to Defendants’ purported \n5  reliance on Sections 8005, 9002, and 284 for border barrier construction. \n6  2.  No Just Reason for Delay \n7  As the Ninth Circuit has explained, “[j]udgments under Rule 54(b) must be reserved for \n8  the unusual case in which the costs and risks of multiplying the number of proceedings and of \n9  overcrowding the appellate docket are outbalanced by pressing needs of the litigants for an early \n10  and separate judgment as to some claims or parties.”  Morrison-Knudsen Co. v. Archer, 655 F.2d \n11  962, 965 (9th Cir. 1981).  Accordingly, an explanation of findings “should include a determination \n12  whether, upon any review of the judgment entered under the rule, the appellate court will be \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  required to address legal or factual issues that are similar to those contained in the claims still \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  pending before the trial court.”  Id. at 965.  “The greater the overlap the greater the chance that \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  [the Court of Appeals] will have to revisit the same facts—spun only slightly differently—in a \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  successive appeal.”  Wood v. GCC Bend, LLC, 422 F.3d 873, 882 (9th Cir. 2005).  “[P]lainly, \nS d nr\nee 17  sound judicial administration does not require that Rule 54(b) requests be granted routinely.”  Id. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  at 879 (internal quotation marks omitted).  \n19  The Court finds there is no just reason for delay under the circumstances.  In their motion, \n20  Defendants contend that “[t]he legal and factual issues do not ‘intersect and overlap’ with the \n21  outstanding claims in this case, which focus on separate statutory authorities, and final judgment \n22  on these claims will not result in piecemeal appeals on the same sets of facts.”  Defs.’ Mot. at 25.  \n23  The Court agrees.  Whether Defendants’ actions comport with the statutory requirements of \n24  Sections 8005 and 9002 and whether Defendants’ actions comport with the remaining statutory \n25  requirements related to outstanding claims are distinct inquiries, largely based on distinct law.  \n26  The Court also recognizes that Defendants’ appeal of the Court’s preliminary injunction order is \n27  currently pending before the Court of Appeals, which recently issued an order holding the briefing \n28  on that appeal in abeyance pending this order.  See Sierra Club v. Trump, No. 19-16102 (9th Cir. \n9 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 185   Filed 06/28/19   Page 10 of 11\n \n1  2019), ECF Nos. 65–66.  This suggests to the Court that the Court of Appeals agrees that “sound \n2  judicial administration” is best served by the Court certifying this judgment for appeal, in light of \n3  the undisputedly significant interests at stake in this case.  See Wood, 422 F.3d at 879. \n4  III.  CONCLUSION \n5  For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART \n6  Plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment and DENIES Defendants’ motion for partial \n7  summary judgment.  Specifically, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ request for declaratory judgment \n8  that Defendants’ intended use of funds reprogrammed under Sections 8005 and 9002 of the \n9  Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2019, for border barrier construction in El Paso Sector \n10  1, Yuma Sector 1, El Centro Sector, and Tucson Sectors 1–3, is unlawful.  The Court DENIES \n11  Plaintiffs’ request for declaratory judgment concerning Defendants’ (1) invocation of Sections \n12  8005 and 9002 beyond these sectors, (2) invocation of Section 284, and (3) compliance with \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  NEPA. \nCfi\n tclaC 14  The terms of the permanent injunction are as follows7:  Defendants Mark T. Esper, in his \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  official capacity as Acting Secretary of Defense, Kevin K. McAleenan, in his official capacity as \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Acting Secretary of Homeland Security, Steven T. Mnuchin, in his official capacity as Secretary \nS d nr\nee 17  of the Department of the Treasury, and all persons acting under their direction, are enjoined from \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  taking any action to construct a border barrier in the areas Defendants have identified as El Paso \n19  Sector 1, Yuma Sector 1, El Centro Sector, and Tucson Sectors 1–3 using funds reprogrammed by \n20  DoD under Sections 8005 and 9002 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2019. \n21  The Clerk is directed to enter final judgment in favor of Plaintiffs and against Defendants \n22  with respect to Defendants’ purported reliance on Sections 8005, 9002, and 284 to fund border \n23  barrier construction.  This judgment will be certified for immediate appeal pursuant to Rule 54(b) \n24  of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n25  // \n26  // \n27 \n                                                 \n7 The Court finds that an injunction against the President personally is not warranted here.

No. 4:19-cv-00892-HSG  \n   Northern District of California,  \n   v.   Oakland  \n     \nDONALD J. TRUMP, in his official  ORDER \ncapacity as President of the United States; et \nal.,  \n  \n          Defendants-Appellants. \n \nBefore:  CLIFTON, N.R. SMITH, and FRIEDLAND, Circuit Judges. \n \nOrder by Judges Clifton and Friedland \nDissent by Judge N.R. Smith \nCLIFTON and FRIEDLAND, Circuit Judges: \nThis emergency proceeding arises from a challenge to a decision by the \nPresident and certain of his cabinet members (collectively, “Defendants”)1 to \n                                           \n1 When federal officials are parties to litigation, we usually refer to them \ncollectively as “the Government.”  That terminology seems inapt in this \nproceeding given that the question before us is whether the Executive Branch of \nthe federal government is attempting to exercise authority that is allocated by the \nConstitution to the Legislative Branch of the federal government, and whether the \nExecutive Branch is doing so without authorization from the Legislative Branch.  \n \n        \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 2 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 2 of 105\n“reprogram” funds appropriated by Congress to the Department of Defense \n(“DoD”) for Army personnel needs and to redirect those funds toward building a \nbarrier along portions of our country’s southern border.   \nThis reprogramming decision was made after President Trump had \nrepeatedly sought appropriations from Congress for the construction of a border \nbarrier.  Although Congress provided some funding for those purposes, it \nconsistently refused to pass any measures that met the President’s desired funding \nlevel, creating a standoff that led to a 35-day partial government shutdown.  The \nPresident signed the budget legislation that ended the shutdown, but he then \ndeclared a national emergency and pursued other means to get additional funding \nfor border barrier construction beyond what Congress had appropriated.  One of \nthose means, and the one at issue in this emergency request for a stay, was a \nreprogramming of funds by DoD in response to a request by the Department of \nHomeland Security (“DHS”). \nSpecifically, DoD relied on section 8005 of the Department of Defense \nAppropriations Act of 2019 and related provisions to reprogram approximately \n$2.5 billion, moving the funds from DoD to DHS, for the purpose of building \n                                           \nAnd the House of Representatives, which is part of the Legislative Branch, has \nfiled an amicus brief opposing the Executive Branch’s position.  To avoid \nconfusion, we therefore refer to the President and the cabinet members sued here \ncollectively as “Defendants.” \n   2     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 3 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 3 of 105\nborder barriers in certain locations within Arizona, California, and New Mexico.  \nSection 8005 authorizes the Secretary of Defense to transfer funds for military \npurposes if the Secretary determines that the transfer is “for higher priority items, \nbased on unforeseen military requirements” and “the item for which funds are \nrequested has [not] been denied by the Congress.”  Pub. L. No. 115-245, § 8005, \n132 Stat. 2981, 2999 (2018) (hereinafter “section 8005”). \nThe Sierra Club and the Southern Border Communities Coalition \n(collectively, “Plaintiffs”) sued Defendants to enjoin the reprogramming and the \nfunds’ expenditure.  They argued that the requirements of section 8005 had not \nbeen satisfied and that the use of the funds to build a border barrier was \naccordingly unsupported by any congressional appropriation and thus \nunconstitutional.  A federal district court agreed with Plaintiffs and enjoined \nDefendants from using reprogrammed funds to construct a border barrier.  \nDefendants now move for an emergency stay of the district court’s injunction.  \nTo rule on Defendants’ motion, we consider several factors, including \nwhether Defendants have shown that they are likely to succeed on the merits of \ntheir appeal, the degree of hardship to each side that would result from a stay or its \ndenial, and the public interest in granting or denying a stay.   \nWe conclude, first, that Defendants are not likely to succeed on the merits of \ntheir appeal.  The Appropriations Clause of the Constitution provides that “No \n   3     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 4 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 4 of 105\nMoney shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations \nmade by Law.”  U.S. Const. art I., § 9, cl. 7.  Defendants assert that, through \nsection 8005, Congress authorized DoD to reprogram the funds at issue.  We agree \nwith Plaintiffs, however, that the requirements of section 8005 have not been met.  \nSpecifically, the need for which the funds were reprogrammed was not \n“unforeseen,” and it was an item for which funds were previously “denied by the \nCongress.”  Defendants do not argue that their contrary interpretation of section \n8005 is entitled to any form of administrative deference, and we hold that no such \ndeference would be appropriate in any event.   \nBecause section 8005 did not authorize DoD to reprogram the funds—and \nDefendants do not and cannot argue that any other statutory or constitutional \nprovision authorized the reprogramming—the use of those funds violates the \nconstitutional requirement that the Executive Branch not spend money absent an \nappropriation from Congress.   \nDefendants contend that these Plaintiffs are unlikely to prevail because they \nlack a cause of action through which to challenge the reprogramming.  We \ndisagree.  Plaintiffs either have an equitable cause of action to enjoin a \nconstitutional violation, or they can proceed on their constitutional claims under \nthe Administrative Procedure Act, or both.  To the extent any zone of interests test \n   4     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 5 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 5 of 105\nwere to apply to Plaintiffs’ constitutional claims, we hold that it would be satisfied \nhere.   \nConsidering the remaining factors relevant to Defendants’ request for a \nstay—the degree of hardship that may result from a stay or its denial, and the \npublic interest at stake—we are not persuaded that a stay should be entered.  There \nis a strong likelihood that Plaintiffs will prevail in this litigation, and Defendants \nhave a correspondingly low likelihood of success on appeal.  As for the public \ninterest, we conclude that it is best served by respecting the Constitution’s \nassignment of the power of the purse to Congress, and by deferring to Congress’s \nunderstanding of the public interest as reflected in its repeated denial of more \nfunding for border barrier construction.  We therefore hold that a stay of the district \ncourt’s order granting Plaintiffs an injunction is not warranted. \nI.  Factual & Procedural Background \nPresident Trump has made numerous requests to Congress for funding for \nconstruction of a barrier on the U.S.-Mexico border.  In his proposed budget for \nFiscal Year 2018, for example, the President requested $2.6 billion for border \nsecurity, including “funding to plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the \nsouthern border.”  Office of Mgmt. & Budget, Exec. Office of the President, \nBudget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 2018, at 18 (2017).  Congress \npartially obliged, allocating in the 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act $1.571 \n   5     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 6 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 6 of 105\nbillion for border fencing, “border barrier planning and design,” and the \n“acquisition and deployment of border security technology.”  Consolidated \nAppropriations Act, 2018, Pub. L. No. 115-141, div. F, tit. II, § 230(a), 132 Stat. \n348, 616 (2018).  Throughout 2018, House and Senate lawmakers introduced \nnumerous bills that would have authorized or appropriated additional billions for \nborder barrier construction.  Specifically, Congress considered and rejected the \nSecuring America’s Future Act of 2018, H.R. 4760, 115th Cong. § 1111 (2018) \n(instructing the Secretary of Homeland Security to take necessary actions to build a \nphysical barrier on the southern border); the Border Security and Immigration \nReform Act of 2018, H.R. 6136, 115th Cong. § 5101 (2018) (appropriating \n$16.625 billion for a border wall); the American Border Act, H.R. 6415, 115th \nCong. § 4101 (2018) (same); the Fund and Complete the Border Wall Act, H.R. \n6657, 115th Cong. § 2 (2018) (creating a “Secure the Southern Border Fund” for \nappropriations for border barrier construction); the Build the Wall, Enforce the \nLaw Act of 2018, H.R. 7059, 115th Cong. § 9 (2018) (again, appropriating \n$16.625 billion for a “border wall system”); the 50 Votes for the Wall Act, H.R. \n7073, 115th Cong. § 2 (2018) (establishing a “Border Wall and Security Trust \nFund” of up to $25 billion to “construct a wall (including physical barriers and \nassociated detection technology, roads, and lighting)” along the U.S.-Mexico \nborder); and the WALL Act of 2018, S. 3713, 115th Cong. § 2 (2018) \n   6     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 7 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 7 of 105\n(appropriating $25 billion for the construction of a border wall).  Lawmakers spent \ncountless hours considering these various proposals, but none ultimately passed. \nThe situation reached an impasse in December 2018.  During negotiations \nwith Congress over an appropriations bill to fund various parts of the federal \ngovernment for the remainder of the fiscal year, the President announced his \nunequivocal position that “any measure that funds the government must include \nborder security.”  C-SPAN, Farm Bill Signing (Dec. 20, 2018), https://www.c-\nspan.org/video/?456189-1/president-government-funding-bill-include-money-\nborder-wall.  He declared that he would not sign any funding bill that did not \nallocate substantial funding for a physical barrier on the U.S.-Mexico border.  \nErica Werner et al., Trump Says He Won’t Sign Senate Deal to Avert Shutdown, \nDemands Funds for Border Security, Wash. Post (Dec. 21, 2018), \nhttps://wapo.st/2EIpkHu?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.6e7c259f6857 (“Werner et al.”).  \nThe President also stated that he was willing to declare a national emergency and \nuse other mechanisms to get the money he desired if Congress refused to allocate \nit.

But the Senate rejected the bill.  The \nPresident could not reach an agreement with lawmakers on whether the spending \nbill would include border barrier funding, triggering what would become the \nnation’s longest partial government shutdown.  Werner et al., supra; Mihir Zaveri \net al., The Government Shutdown Was the Longest Ever.  Here’s the History., N.Y. \nTimes (Jan. 25, 2019), https://nyti.ms/2RATHG9.   \nOn January 6, 2019, during the shutdown, the President “request[ed] $5.7 \nbillion for construction of a steel barrier for the Southwest border” in a letter to the \nSenate Committee on Appropriations, explaining that the request “would fund \nconstruction of a total of approximately 234 miles of new physical barrier,” \nincluding in the top ten priority areas in the Border Security Improvement Plan \ncreated by Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”).  Letter from Russell T. \nVought, Acting Dir. of the Office of Mgmt. and Budget, to Richard Shelby, \nChairman of the Senate Comm. on Appropriations (Jan. 6, 2019).  This represented \na $4.1 billion increase over the President’s February 2018 request for $1.6 billion \nfor the Fiscal Year 2019 budget, which had been for the construction of “65 miles \n   8     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 9 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 9 of 105\nof border wall in south Texas.”  Office of Mgmt. & Budget, Exec. Office of the \nPresident, Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2019, 58 (2018).   \nAfter 35 days, the government shutdown ended without an agreement \nproviding increased border barrier funding.  Remarks Delivered by President \nTrump on the Government Shutdown (Jan. 25, 2019), \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-\ngovernment-shutdown/.  Congress passed and the President signed a stopgap \nspending measure to reopen for three weeks the parts of the Government that had \nbeen shut down.  H.R.J. Res. 28, 116th Cong. (2019).  But the President made clear \nthat he still intended to build a border barrier, with or without funding from \nCongress.  As the Acting White House Chief of Staff explained, the President was \nprepared to both reprogram money and declare a national emergency to obtain a \ntotal sum “well north of $5.7 billion.”  Gregg Re, Border Wall Talks Break Down \nAhead of Second Possible Government Shutdown, Fox News (Feb. 10, 2019), \nhttps://fxn.ws/2SmNK0I.  \nCongress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019 (“CAA”) on \nFebruary 14, 2019, which included the Department of Homeland Security \nAppropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2019.  Pub. L. No. 116-6, div. A, 133 Stat. 13 \n(2019).  The CAA appropriated only $1.375 billion of the $5.7 billion the President \nhad sought in border barrier funding and specified that the $1.375 billion was “for \n   9     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 10 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 10 of 105\nthe construction of primary pedestrian fencing . . . in the Rio Grande Valley \nSector.”  Id. § 230(a)(1), 133 Stat. at 28.  Congress also imposed several \nlimitations on the use of those funds, including by not allowing construction within \ncertain wildlife refuges and parks.  Id. § 231, 133 Stat. at 28.   \nThe President signed the CAA into law the following day.  Statement by the \nPresident, The White House (Feb. 15, 2019), \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-by-the-president-28/.  \nHe concurrently issued a proclamation under the National Emergencies Act, 50 \nU.S.C. §§ 1601-1651, “declar[ing] that a national emergency exists at the southern \nborder of the United States.” Proclamation No. 9844, 84 Fed. Reg. 4949 (Feb. 15, \n2019) (“Proclamation No. 9844”).   \nProclamation No. 9844 described “a border security and humanitarian crisis \nthat threatens core national security interests” because the border served as a major \nentry point for criminals, gang members, and illicit narcotics and the number of \nfamily units entering the United States had recently increased.  Id.  It declared that \nthis “emergency situation” necessitated support from the Armed Forces.  Id.  The \nproclamation made available to DoD “the construction authority provided in” 10 \nU.S.C. § 2808, which is limited to presidential declarations “that require[] use of \nthe armed forces,” id. § 2808(a).  \n   10     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 11 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 11 of 105\nAn accompanying White House Fact Sheet explained that the President was \n“using his legal authority to take Executive action to secure additional resources” \nto build a border barrier.  President Donald J. Trump’s Border Security Victory, \nThe White House (Feb. 15, 2019), https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-\nstatements/president-donald-j-trumps-border-security-victory/.  It continued: \n“Including funding in Homeland Security appropriations, the Administration has \nso far identified up to $8.1 billion that will be available to build the border wall \nonce a national emergency is declared and additional funds have been \nreprogrammed.”  Id.  The fact sheet specifically identified three funding sources: \n(1) “[a]bout $601 million from the Treasury Forfeiture Fund,” 31 U.S.C. \n§ 9705(a); (2) “[u]p to $2.5 billion under the Department of Defense \n[reprogrammed] funds transferred [to DHS] for Support for Counterdrug \nActivities” pursuant to 10 U.S.C. § 284 (“section 284”);2 and (3) “[u]p to $3.6 \nbillion reallocated from [DoD] military construction projects under the President’s \n                                           \n2 Title 10, Chapter 15 of the U.S. Code describes various forms of military \nsupport for civilian law enforcement agencies.  Within that chapter, section 284 \nauthorizes the Secretary of Defense to “provide support for the counterdrug \nactivities . . . of any other department or agency of the Federal Government” if it \nreceives a request from “the official who has responsibility for the counterdrug \nactivities.”  10 U.S.C. §§ 284(a), 284(a)(1)(A).  The statute permits, among other \nthings, support for “[c]onstruction of roads and fences and installation of lighting \nto block drug smuggling corridors across international boundaries of the United \nStates.”  Id. § 284(b)(7).  DoD’s provision of support for other agencies pursuant to \nsection 284 does not require the declaration of a national emergency. \n \n   11     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 12 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 12 of 105\ndeclaration of a national emergency” pursuant to 10 U.S.C. § 2808 (“section \n2808”), which provides that the Secretary of Defense may authorize military \nconstruction projects whenever the President declares a national emergency that \nrequires use of the armed forces.  Id.   \nThe House and Senate adopted a joint resolution terminating the President’s \ndeclaration of a national emergency pursuant to Congress’s authority under 50 \nU.S.C. § 1622(a)(1).  H.R.J. Res. 46, 116th Cong. (2019).  The President vetoed \nthe joint resolution, Veto Message to the House of Representatives for H.J. Res. 46, \nThe White House (Mar. 15, 2019), https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-\nstatements/veto-message-house-representatives-h-j-res-46/, and a vote in the House \nto override the veto fell short of the required two-thirds majority, 165 Cong. Rec. \nH2799, H2814-15 (2019). \nAlmost immediately, executive branch agencies began to use the funds \nidentified in Proclamation 9844 for border barrier construction.  The same day the \nPresident issued the proclamation, the Department of the Treasury approved \nDHS’s December 2018 request to use treasury forfeiture funds to enhance border \nsecurity infrastructure, providing up to $601 million in funding.3  Letter from \n                                           \n3 The three funding sources the White House had identified were to “be used \nsequentially and as needed.”  President Donald J. Trump’s Border Security \nVictory, The White House (Feb. 15, 2019).  In other words, the government first \nbegan spending the treasury forfeiture funds, followed by DoD funding \n \n   12     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 13 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 13 of 105\nDavid F. Eisner, Assistant Sec’y for Mgmt., U.S. Dep’t of the Treasury, to the \nHouse and Senate Appropriations Comms.’ Subcomms. on Fin. Servs. & Gen. \nGov’t (Feb. 15, 2019).  Then, on February 25, DHS submitted a request to DoD for \nassistance, pursuant to section 284, with construction of fences, roads, and lighting \nwithin eleven drug-smuggling corridors identified by DHS along the border.  \nMemorandum re: Request for Assistance Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. § 284 from \nChristina Bobb, Exec. Sec’y, DHS, to Capt. Hallock N. Mohler, Jr., Exec. Sec’y, \nDoD, (Feb. 25, 2019).  In response to that request, on March 25, the Acting \nSecretary of Defense, Patrick Shanahan, approved the transfer of up to $1 billion in \nfunds from DoD to DHS for the three highest priority drug-smuggling corridors: \nthe Yuma Sector Project 1 and Yuma Sector Project 2 in Arizona, and the El Paso \nSector Project 1 in New Mexico.4  Letter from Patrick M. Shanahan, Acting Sec’y \nof Def., DoD, to Kirstjen Nielsen, Sec’y of Homeland Sec., DHS (Mar. 25, 2019).  \nTo fund the approved projects, Shanahan invoked section 8005 of the \nDepartment of Defense Appropriations Act of 2019 and section 1001 of the John \nS. McCain National Defense Authorization Act (“NDAA”) for Fiscal Year 2019 to \n“reprogram” approximately $1 billion from Army personnel funds to the \n                                           \nreprogrammed under section 8005 and transferred to DHS pursuant to section 284, \nand finally military construction funds reallocated under section 2808. \n4 The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which is tasked with initial project \nscoping and construction, has since decided not to fund or construct Yuma Project \n2 under § 284. \n   13     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 14 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 14 of 105\ncounter-narcotics support budget, which Shanahan asserted then made those funds \navailable for transfer to DHS pursuant to section 284.  Section 8005 authorizes the \nSecretary of Defense to transfer up to $4 billion “of working capital funds of the \nDepartment of Defense or funds made available in this Act to the Department of \nDefense for military functions (except military construction).”  The Secretary must \nfirst determine that “such action is necessary in the national interest” and obtain \napproval from the White House Office of Management and Budget.  Section 8005 \nfurther provides that the authority to transfer may only be used “for higher priority \nitems, based on unforeseen military requirements, than those for which originally \nappropriated and in no case where the item for which funds are requested has been \ndenied by the Congress.”5  It also imposes a “prompt[]” congressional notification \nrequirement for all transfers made under its authority.  Reprogramming of funds \nunder section 8005 does not require the declaration of a national emergency.   \nA memo from Shanahan asserted that the statutory requirements for \nreprogramming under section 8005 had been met: that the items to be funded were \na higher priority than the Army personnel funds; that the need to provide support \nfor the Yuma and El Paso Projects was “an unforeseen military requirement not \n                                           \n5 Equivalent language restricting the circumstances in which reprogramming \nis permitted has been included in defense appropriations statutes since 1974.

Shanahan, \nActing Sec’y of Def., DoD, to Under Sec’y of Def. (Comptroller)/Chief Fin. \nOfficer (Mar. 25, 2019).  Specifically, DoD concluded that “Army personnel funds \nwere available for transfer because expenditures for service member pay and \ncompensation, retirements benefits, food, and moving expenses through the end of \nfiscal year 2019 [would] be lower than originally budgeted.”  As required by \nsection 8005, Shanahan also formally notified Congress of the reprogramming \nauthorization, explaining that the reprogrammed funds were “required” so that \nDoD could provide DHS the support it requested under section 284.6 \nThe next day, both the House Committee on Armed Services and the House \nCommittee on Appropriations formally disapproved of DoD’s section 8005 \nreprogramming.  The Armed Services Committee wrote in a letter to DoD that it \n“denie[d] this [reprogramming] request,” and that the committee “[did] not \napprove the proposed use of Department of Defense funds to construct additional \n                                           \n6 DoD had previously adhered to a “gentlemen’s agreement” with Congress \nwhere it sought approval from the relevant committees before reprogramming \nfunds, rather than simply notifying them after the decision had been finalized.  \nHouse Armed Services Committee Holds Hearing on Fiscal 2020 Defense \nAuthorization, CQ Cong.

Visclosky, Chairman of \nthe Def. Subcomm. of the U.S. House of Representatives Comm. on \nAppropriations (Mar. 26, 2019). \nOfficials at DoD and DHS pressed forward with reprogramming-enabled \nborder barrier construction plans.  In early April, DoD awarded contracts for work \nin the Yuma and El Paso Project areas, and the agencies began environmental \nplanning and consultation.

(Apr. 9, \n2019), https://dod.defense.gov/News/Contracts/Contract-View/Article/1809986/.  \nMeanwhile, Shanahan reported on May 8 that DoD and DHS had secured \nfunding for DHS to build about 256 miles of border barrier using both treasury \nforfeiture funds and reprogrammed monies.

On May \n9, Shanahan invoked section 8005 and section 1001 of the NDAA again—along \nwith related reprogramming provisions, section 9002 of the Department of Defense \nAppropriations Act of 2019 and section 1512 of the NDAA7—to authorize an \nadditional $1.5 billion in reprogramming to fund four more projects.  \nMemorandum re: Additional Support to the Dep’t of Homeland Security from \nPatrick M. Shanahan, Acting Sec’y of Def., DoD (May 9, 2019).  The new \nprojects, El Centro Project 1 and Tucson Sector Projects 1, 2, and 3, are located in \nCalifornia and Arizona.  Around the same time, the President indicated that he \nexpected to approve additional projects using funds authorized by the national \nemergency declaration pursuant to section 2808, although no concrete action has \n                                           \n7 Section 9002 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2019 \nauthorizes the Secretary of Defense to transfer up to $2 billion between the \nappropriations or funds made available to DoD if he determines “that such action is \nnecessary in the national interest” and obtains approval from the Office of \nManagement and Budget.  Pub. L. No. 115-245, § 9002, 132 Stat 2981, 3042 \n(2018).  Section 9002 “is subject to the same terms and conditions as the authority \nprovided in section 8005.”  Id.  Section 1512 of the NDAA likewise provides a \nspecial transfer authority for up to $3.5 billion upon determination that it is \n“necessary in the national interest,” and, under section 1001 of the NDAA, is \nsubject to identical terms and conditions as 8005.  Pub. L. No. 115-232, § 1512, \n132 Stat. 1636, 2096 (2018).  Because it is uncontested that all of these \nreprogramming provisions are subject to section 8005’s requirements, we refer to \nthese requirements collectively by reference to section 8005.

See White House Memorandum on Sequencing of \nBorder Barrier Construction Authorities (Mar. 4, 2019). \n  On February 19, 2019, the Sierra Club and Southern Border Communities \nCoalition filed a lawsuit against Donald J. Trump, in his official capacity as \nPresident of the United States; Patrick M. Shanahan, in his official capacity as \nActing Secretary of Defense; Kirstjen M. Nielsen, in her official capacity as \nSecretary of Homeland Security; and Steven Mnuchin, in his official capacity as \nSecretary of the Treasury (collectively, “Defendants,” see supra n.1).8  This \nlawsuit followed closely on the heels of a related action brought by a coalition of \nstates against the same group of Defendants and others. \n  Plaintiffs are two nonprofit organizations who sued on behalf of themselves \nand their members.  The Sierra Club is dedicated to enjoyment of the outdoors and \nenvironmental protection, and it engages in advocacy and public education on \nissues such as habitat destruction, land use, and the human and environmental \nimpact of construction projects, including the proposed construction of the border \nbarrier.

Plaintiffs also \nallege that Defendants are acting ultra vires (without authority) in seeking to divert \nfunding without statutory authority to do so.   \nPlaintiffs allege that Defendants’ use of the reprogrammed funds would \ninjure their members because the noise of construction, additional personnel, visual \nblight, and negative ecological effects that would accompany a border barrier and \nits construction would detract from their ability to hike, fish, enjoy the desert \nlandscapes, and observe and study a diverse range of wildlife in areas near the \nU.S.-Mexico border.  Plaintiffs also allege that they participated in the legislative \nprocess by “devot[ing] substantial staff and other resources towards legislative \nadvocacy leading up to the appropriations bill passed by Congress in February \n2019, specifically directed towards securing Congress’s denial of substantial \nfunding to the border wall.”  The Complaint requests declaratory and permanent \n   19     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 20 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 20 of 105\ninjunctive relief to prevent construction of the border barrier using the funding at \nissue in the lawsuit.  \n  On April 4, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, asking the \ndistrict court to enter a “preliminary injunction prohibiting Defendants and all \npersons associated with them from taking action to build a border wall using funds \nor resources from the Defense Department; and specifically enjoining construction \nof the wall segments in the . . . ‘Yuma Sector Projects 1 and 2 and El Paso Sector \nProject 1 [areas].’”  In particular, Plaintiffs moved to enjoin Defendants from using \nDoD’s reprogramming authority in section 8005 to transfer funds from Army \npersonnel into the counterdrug appropriations line, from subsequently using \nsection 284 to divert those funds from DoD’s counterdrug appropriations line to be \nused by DHS for border barrier construction, from invoking section 2808 to divert \nfunds appropriated to military construction projects, and from taking any further \naction before complying with NEPA’s procedural requirements.  Plaintiffs argued \nthat a preliminary injunction was necessary because Defendants had already \ndiverted funds, and that Plaintiffs would be irreparably harmed if Defendants \nproceeded with their threatened construction during the pendency of the district \ncourt proceedings.  After receiving briefing from both sides, the district court held \na multiple-hour hearing on May 17, 2019.  \n   20     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 21 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 21 of 105\nOn May 24, the district court issued an order granting the motion in part and \ndenying it in part.  Sierra Club v. Trump, No. 4:19-cv-00892-HSG, 2019 WL \n2247689 (N.D. Cal. May 24, 2019).  After concluding that Plaintiffs had standing \nto bring their challenge, the district court held that Plaintiffs were entitled to a \npreliminary injunction with respect to the section 8005 reprogramming authority \nbecause they would likely succeed in arguing that Defendants acted ultra vires, \nthey had demonstrated that they would be irreparably harmed, and the balance of \nequities weighed in their favor.  Id. at *13-23, *27-28, *29.  The court declined to \nrule on Plaintiffs’ likelihood of success on their section 2808 arguments, however, \nbecause Defendants had not yet disclosed a plan for diverting funds under that \nauthority.  Id. at *25, *28-29.  Finally, the court concluded that Plaintiffs were \nunlikely to succeed on their NEPA argument.  Id. at *26.  It accordingly granted \nthe following preliminary injunction: \nDefendants Patrick M. Shanahan, in his official capacity as Acting Secretary \nof Defense, Kevin K. McAleenan, in his official capacity as Acting \nSecretary of Homeland Security, Steven T. Mnuchin, in his official capacity \nas Secretary of the Department of the Treasury, and all persons acting under \ntheir direction, are enjoined from taking any action to construct a border \nbarrier in the areas Defendants have identified as Yuma Sector Project 1 and \nEl Paso Sector Project 1 using funds reprogrammed by DoD under Section \n8005 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2019.  \n \n   21     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 22 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 22 of 105\nId. at 30.9   \nDefendants filed a motion in the district court to stay the preliminary \ninjunction pending appeal.  The district court denied that motion, concluding that \nDefendants were unlikely to prevail on the merits and that the “request to proceed \nimmediately with the enjoined construction would not preserve the status quo” but \nrather would “effectively moot [Plaintiffs’] claims.”  Sierra Club v. Trump, No. \n4:19-cv-00892-HSG, 2019 WL 2305341, at *1 (N.D. Cal. May 30, 2019). \nOn June 3, 2019, Defendants filed an emergency motion with this court \nrequesting a stay pending appeal.  Defendants implored our court to act as quickly \nas possible because they were incurring daily fees and penalties from contractors \ndue to the suspension of construction and because, if the injunction remained in \nplace, Defendants would need to begin the process of reprogramming the funds \nagain by the end of June or else face the risk of being deprived of the use of those \nfunds entirely.10  \n                                           \n9 The district court simultaneously denied the motion for a preliminary \ninjunction in the related case brought by states, explaining that there was no \nlikelihood of irreparable injury once it had granted the injunction in the Sierra \nClub case.  See State v. Trump, No. 4:19-cv-00872-HSG, 2019 WL 2247814, at \n*17 (N.D. Cal. May 24, 2019). \n10 We note that Defendants did not file any motion to expedite the appeal \nitself, and as explained below, actually filed a motion to delay the expedited \nbriefing schedule our court had issued for the preliminary injunction appeal, asking \nus to let the parties wait until after further anticipated decisions in the district court \nand our court’s decision on their stay motion to propose a new briefing schedule \nthat could govern “any” full appeal. \n   22     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 23 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 23 of 105\nInitial briefing on the stay motion was completed on June 14, and we heard \noral argument on June 20.  On June 24, we requested supplemental briefing from \nthe parties on issues that arose during oral argument but that had not been briefed.  \nThat briefing was completed on June 28. \nMeanwhile, proceedings continued in the district court.  On May 29, \nPlaintiffs filed a motion for a supplemental preliminary injunction to block the \nadditional planned construction in California and Arizona using funds \nreprogrammed under sections 8005 and 9002 of the Department of Defense \nAppropriations Act of 2019, as well as section 1512 of the 2019 NDAA.  Plaintiffs \nacknowledged that the motion “present[ed] virtually identical legal questions \nregarding whether the proposed plan for funding border barrier construction \nexceeds the Executive Branch’s lawful authority” to the ones that the court had \ndecided in its May 24 order granting in part Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary \ninjunction.  On June 12, 2019, Plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment, \nseeking a permanent injunction based on the same arguments made in their initial \nand supplemental motions for a preliminary injunction.  Defendants cross-moved \nfor summary judgment, resting on the same arguments they had made against the \npreliminary injunction.  Briefing on those motions was completed on June 24. \nOn June 28, the district court issued an order granting in part and denying in \npart Plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment, and denying Defendants’ \n   23     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 24 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 24 of 105\ncross-motion for partial summary judgment.  Sierra Club v. Trump, No. \n4:19-cv-00892-HSG, 2019 WL 2715422 (N.D. Cal. June 28, 2019).  In that order, \nthe court issued a permanent injunction prohibiting Defendants from using \nreprogrammed funds to construct a border barrier in the El Paso and Yuma Sectors \n(the subject of the initial preliminary injunction) as well as the more recently-\nannounced El Centro and Tucson Sector areas (the subject of the motion for a \nsupplemental preliminary injunction).11  Id. at *6.  The district court concluded that \nPlaintiffs’ legal challenge was meritorious, that Plaintiffs had shown that they \nwould suffer irreparable harm absent a permanent injunction, and that the balance \nof hardships and the public interest supported a permanent injunction.  Id. at *4-5.  \nThe court heeded Defendants’ request to certify the judgment for immediate \n                                           \n11 The terms of the permanent injunction are identical to those of the \npreliminary injunction, but it also covers funds reprogrammed under sections 8005 \nand 9002 for construction in the El Centro and Tucson sectors.  In full, the \npermanent injunction states: \nDefendants Mark T. Esper, in his official capacity as Acting Secretary of \nDefense, Kevin K. McAleenan, in his official capacity as Acting Secretary \nof Homeland Security, Steven T. Mnuchin, in his official capacity as \nSecretary of the Department of the Treasury, and all persons acting under \ntheir direction, are enjoined from taking any action to construct a border \nbarrier in the areas Defendants have identified as El Paso Sector 1, Yuma \nSector 1, El Centro Sector, and Tucson Sectors 1–3 using funds \nreprogrammed by DoD under Sections 8005 and 9002 of the Department of \nDefense Appropriations Act, 2019. \nSierra Club, 2019 WL 2715422, at *6. \n   24     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 25 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 25 of 105\nappeal, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b), and it denied Defendants’ request to stay the \ninjunction pending appeal.  Id. at *5-6. \nDefendants filed an immediate notice of appeal from that decision.  At \nDefendants’ request, we consolidated their new appeal with the pending appeal of \nthe preliminary injunction.  Defendants now seek a stay of the permanent \ninjunction pending appeal, resting on the same arguments they made about the \npreliminary injunction because the underlying legal questions are identical. \nII.  Issues Not Before the Court \nBefore turning to the merits, we highlight what is not at issue in this appeal.  \nFirst, Defendants at oral argument acknowledged that they are “not challenging \n[Article III] standing for purposes of the stay motion.”  Thus, Defendants do not \ndispute that Plaintiffs have suffered an “actual or imminent,” “concrete and \nparticularized,” “injury in fact” that is “fairly traceable” to Defendants’ actions and \nthat will “likely” be “redressed by a favorable decision.”  Lujan v. Defs. of \nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992) (quotation marks and alterations omitted); \nSpokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016).  We have satisfied ourselves \nthat Defendants’ assessment is correct.  See Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw \nEnvtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 180 (2000) (discussing a court’s sua \nsponte obligation to assure itself that it has jurisdiction before proceeding to the \nmerits).  Plaintiffs have alleged enough to satisfy the requirements for standing \n   25     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 26 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 26 of 105\nunder Article III at this stage of the litigation.  Id. at 181-83 (holding that the \nplaintiffs’ injuries from environmental harm were sufficient for standing). \nSecond, although Defendants may have access to other funding sources to \nbuild a border barrier, the only source at issue in this stay motion is section 8005 \nreprogramming.12  The district court’s preliminary injunction order discussed \nvarious other potential sources, including the Treasury Forfeiture Fund and money \nreallocated after a national emergency declaration for “military construction \nprojects” under section 2808.  Sierra Club v. Trump, No. 4:19-cv-00892-HSG, \n2019 WL 2247689, at *11 (N.D. Cal. May 24, 2019).  The injunction, however, \nonly concerns section 8005 reprogramming for border barrier construction in \nYuma Sector Project 1, El Paso Sector 1, El Centro Sector 1, and Tucson Sectors \n1-3.  We have not been asked to expand the scope of the injunction, and the parties \nhave not addressed in this stay motion any non-section 8005 funding sources.  \nAccordingly, our decision does not address any sources of funds Defendants might \nuse to build a border barrier except those reprogrammed under section 8005.   \nThird, as the district court observed in the preliminary injunction order,  \nThe case is not about whether the challenged border \nbarrier construction plan is wise or unwise.  It is not \n                                           \n12 As noted above, the parties do not contest that the related reprogramming \nprovisions—section 9002 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of \n2019 and section 1512 of the NDAA—are subject to section 8005’s requirements.  \nWe accordingly refer to these requirements collectively by reference to section \n8005. \n   26     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 27 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 27 of 105\nabout whether the plan is the right or wrong policy \nresponse to existing conditions at the southern border of \nthe United States.  These policy questions are the subject \nof extensive, and often intense, differences of opinion, \nand this Court cannot and does not express any view as to \nthem.   \nSierra Club, 2019 WL 2247689, at *1.  Our consideration is limited to legal \nquestions regarding the authority of the Executive Branch under the Constitution \nand under statutes enacted into law by Congress. \nIII.  Justiciability \n  Defendants have not argued that jurisdiction over this action is lacking.  Nor \nhave they asserted that Plaintiffs’ challenge to the section 8005 reprogramming \npresents a nonjusticiable “political question.”  They have contended, however, that \n“[t]he real separation-of-powers concern is the district court’s intrusion into the \nbudgeting process,” which “is between the Legislative and Executive Branches—\nnot the judiciary.”  We consider, therefore, whether it is appropriate for the courts \nto entertain Plaintiffs’ action in the first place.  We conclude that it is. \n“Cases” and “controversies” that contain “a textually demonstrable \nconstitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department,” Baker \nv. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 217 (1962), or “revolve around policy choices and value \ndeterminations constitutionally committed for resolution to the halls of Congress or \nthe confines of the Executive Branch,” Japan Whaling Ass’n v. Am. Cetacean Soc., \n478 U.S. 221, 230 (1986), present a “narrow exception” to our responsibility to \n   27     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 28 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 28 of 105\ndecide cases properly before us, Zivotofsky ex rel. Zivotofsky v. Clinton, 566 U.S. \n189, 195 (2012).   \nNowhere does the Constitution grant Congress the exclusive ability to \ndetermine whether the Executive Branch has violated the Appropriations Clause.  \nSee Office of Pers. Mgmt. v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414, 425 (1990).  Nor does the \nConstitution leave the Executive Branch to police itself.  Rather, the judiciary \n“appropriately exercises” its constitutional function “where the question is whether \nCongress or the Executive is ‘aggrandizing its power at the expense of another \nbranch.’”  Zivotofsky, 566 U.S. at 197 (quoting Freytag v. Comm’r, 501 U.S. 868, \n878 (1991)).  \nThe current action does not ask us to decide whether the projects for which \nDefendants seek to reprogram funds are worthy or whether, as a policy judgment, \nfunds should be spent on them.  Instead, we are asked whether the reprogramming \nof funds is consistent with the Appropriations Clause and section 8005.  That “is a \nfamiliar judicial exercise.”  Id. at 196. \nChief Justice Marshall’s answer to “whether the legality of an act of the head \nof a department be examinable in a court of justice” or “only politically \nexaminable” remains the same: “[W]here a specific duty is assigned by law, and \nindividual rights depend upon the performance of that duty, . . . the individual who \nconsiders himself injured, has a right to resort to the laws of his country for a \n   28     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 29 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 29 of 105\nremedy.”  Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 165-66 (1803).  Pursuant to \nits exclusive power of appropriation, Congress imposed on the Executive Branch a \nduty—contained in section 8005—not to transfer funds unless certain \ncircumstances were present.  As discussed above, see supra Section II, Defendants \nhave not disputed that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged injuries that satisfy \nArticle III’s standing requirement to enable them to pursue this action.  Although \n“our decision may have significant political overtones,” Japan Whaling Ass’n, 478 \nU.S. at 230, “courts cannot avoid their responsibility merely ‘because the issues \nhave political implications,’” Zivotofsky, 566 U.S. at 196 (quoting INS v. Chadha, \n462 U.S. 919, 943 (1983)).  In sum, it is appropriate for this action to proceed in \nfederal court.  \nIV.  Stay Standards \nWe decide whether to issue a stay by considering four factors, reiterated by \nthe Supreme Court in Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418 (2009):  \n(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is \nlikely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be \nirreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will \nsubstantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding; and \n(4) where the public interest lies.   \nId. at 434 (quoting Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776 (1987)).  The first two \nfactors “are the most critical,” and we only reach the last two “[o]nce an applicant \nsatisfies the first two factors.”  Id. at 434-35.   \n   29     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 30 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 30 of 105\nThe requirement that an applicant for a stay make a “strong showing” may \nbe explained at least in part by the fact that “[a] stay is not a matter of right, even if \nirreparable injury might otherwise result.”  Id. at 433 (quoting Virginian Ry. Co. v. \nUnited States, 272 U.S. 658, 672 (1926)).  Indeed, “[a] stay is an intrusion into the \nordinary processes of administration and judicial review.”  Id. at 427 (quotation \nmarks omitted).  Issuing a stay is therefore “an exercise of judicial discretion” not \nto be issued “reflexively,” but rather based on the circumstances of the particular \ncase.  Id. at 427, 433.  “The party requesting a stay bears the burden of showing \nthat the circumstances justify an exercise of that discretion.”  Id. at 433-34.  Here, \nDefendants carry those burdens because it is Defendants who have sought a stay. \nThat being said, the unusual circumstances of this case complicate our \ntypically restrained approach to assessing the merits in this procedural posture.  \nWhen deciding whether to issue a stay, we usually speak about the merits in \nprobabilistic “likelihood” terms, in part because we recognize that the “ordinary \nprocesses of administration and judicial review” best ensure “careful review and a \nmeaningful decision.”  Id. at 427 (quotation marks omitted).  Particularly given a \nrecent increase in emergency petitions asking for injunctive relief or stays of \ninjunctive relief, we think it is especially important for courts to strive to follow the \ntraditional process of judicial review.  Otherwise, we are forced to decide “justice \non the fly.”  Id. \n   30     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 31 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 31 of 105\nHere, however, both sides contend that we must evaluate the merits of this \ncase now to preserve their interests—both agree that there is no time for the \n“ordinary” course of appellate review.13  As Defendants represented in their \nbriefing and again at oral argument, if the injunction remains in place, DoD’s \nauthority to spend the remaining challenged funds on border barrier construction, \nor to redirect them for other purposes, will lapse.  At the same time, as the district \ncourt noted, allowing Defendants to move forward with spending the funds will \nallow construction to begin, causing immediate, and likely irreparable, harm to \nPlaintiffs.  Sierra Club v. Trump, No. 4:19-cv-00892-HSG, 2019 WL 2247689, at \n*27-28 (N.D. Cal. May 24, 2019).  In either scenario, many of the issues in this \ncase may become moot or largely moot before fuller litigation of the appeal can be \ncompleted.  Accordingly, we proceed to evaluate the merits more fully than we \notherwise might in response to a stay request.14 \n                                           \n13 The dissent suggests that we should not be analyzing the merits at this \nstage because there will be a fuller appeal later.  Dissent at 2 n.1.  That argument \ndepends on disbelieving Defendants’ assertions that the Executive Branch will lose \nits ability to spend the reprogrammed money by the beginning of July, if not \nearlier.  To the extent Defendants’ representations about their imminent injury are \nnot credible, Defendants certainly do not deserve the equitable relief of a stay. \n14 In an appeal from a district court’s grant of a permanent injunction, we \nmay “affirm the district court on any ground supported by the record.”  Sony \nComputer Entm’t, Inc. v. Connectix Corp., 203 F.3d 596, 608 (9th Cir. 2000) \n(quoting Charley’s Taxi Radio Dispatch Corp. v. SIDA of Haw., Inc., 810 F.2d \n869, 874 (9th Cir. 1987)).  Evaluating whether Defendants have a likelihood of \n \n   31     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 32 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 32 of 105\nV.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nIn their operative Complaint, Plaintiffs framed their claim in various ways.  \nPlaintiffs asserted constitutional claims based on violations of separation of powers \nprinciples, the Appropriations Clause, and the Presentment Clause; a claim that \nDefendants acted ultra vires; and a statutory claim under the Consolidated \nAppropriations Act of 2019.15  Because we conclude that Plaintiffs’ claim is, at its \ncore, one alleging a constitutional violation, we focus on that issue.  More than one \nlegal doctrine offers Plaintiffs a cause of action to raise that claim, and Plaintiffs’ \nsuccess under each depends on whether Defendants’ actions indeed violate the \nConstitution. \nA. Plaintiffs’ Constitutional Claim \n  The Constitution’s Appropriations Clause provides that “No Money shall be \ndrawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.”  \nU.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 7.  In addition to safeguarding “the public treasure, the \ncommon fund of all,” and providing “a most useful and salutary check upon . . . \ncorrupt influence and public peculation,” it ensures that the “the executive [does \nnot] possess an unbounded power over the public purse of the nation.”  3 Joseph \n                                           \nsuccess on appeal therefore requires assessing whether there are clear grounds for \naffirmance supported by the record. \n15 Plaintiffs also separately asserted a NEPA claim.  The parties have not \nmade any arguments about the NEPA claim in these stay proceedings, so we do not \naddress it. \n   32     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 33 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 33 of 105\nStory, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States § 1342 (Boston, \nHilliard, Gray & Co. ed. 1833).   \nThis approach to the power of the purse comported with the Founders’ \n“declared purpose of separating and dividing the powers of government,” namely \n“to ‘diffus[e] power the better to secure liberty.’”  Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, \n721 (1986) (alteration in original) (quoting Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. \nSawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring)); see also INS v. \nChadha, 462 U.S. 919, 949-50 (1983) (collecting sources and explaining the \nFounders’ belief in “the need to divide and disperse power in order to protect \nliberty”).  In response to critiques that his proposed Constitution would \ndangerously concentrate power in a single central government, James Madison \nargued that the risk of abuse of such power was low because “the sword and purse \nare not to be given to the same member” of the government.  3 Debates in the \nSeveral State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution 393 \n(Jonathan Elliot ed., 2d ed. 1836).  Instead, Madison explained that “[t]he purse is \nin the hands of the representatives of the people,” who “have the appropriation of \nall moneys.”  Id.   \nPlaintiffs’ principal legal theory is that Defendants seek to spend funds for a \ndifferent purpose than that for which Congress appropriated them, thereby \n   33     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 34 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 34 of 105\nviolating the Appropriations Clause.16  Defendants’ defense to this claim is that, \nthrough section 8005, Congress allowed Defendants to make this reallocation.  If \nDefendants were correct that section 8005 allowed this spending reallocation, \nPlaintiffs’ claim would fail, because the spending would be consistent with \nCongress’s appropriation legislation.  If section 8005 does not authorize the \nreallocation, however, then Defendants are acting outside of any statutory \nappropriation and are therefore spending funds contrary to Congress’s \nappropriations decisions.  We believe Plaintiffs are correct that there is no statutory \nappropriation for the expenditures that are the subject of the injunction.  \nReprogramming and spending those funds therefore violates the Appropriations \nClause.   \n1. Section 8005’s Meaning \n  Defendants argue that they are likely to prevail on appeal because Congress \nhas authorized DoD to reprogram funds, the planned use of funds is consistent with \nthat reprogramming authorization, and this spending is therefore authorized by an \nappropriation from Congress as the Appropriations Clause requires.  We disagree.  \n                                           \n16 Throughout this litigation, Plaintiffs’ claim has been framed in various \nways.  The lack of compliance with section 8005 has sometimes been labeled ultra \nvires as outside statutory authority or as outside the President’s Article II powers, \nand spending without an appropriation has been described as a violation of the \nAppropriations Clause.  However their claim is labeled, Plaintiffs’ theory is \nultimately the same.   \n   34     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 35 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 35 of 105\nDoD’s proposed expenditures are not authorized by the applicable reprogramming \nstatute.  They therefore are not “in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.”  \nU.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 7. \nAt bottom, this constitutional issue turns on a question of statutory \ninterpretation.  Section 8005 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of \n2019 provides that the Secretary of Defense may reprogram funds for certain \nmilitary functions other than those for which they were initially appropriated, but it \nlimits the Secretary’s ability to do so to a narrow set of circumstances.  Pub. L. No. \n115-245, § 8005, 132 Stat. 2981, 2999 (2018).17  Transferred funds must address \n                                           \n17 Section 8005 provides, in relevant part:  \n \nUpon determination by the Secretary of Defense that such action \nis necessary in the national interest, he may, with the approval of \nthe Office of Management and Budget, transfer not to exceed \n$4,000,000,000 of working capital funds of the Department of \nDefense or funds made available in this Act to the Department of \nDefense for military functions (except military construction) \nbetween such appropriations or funds or any subdivision thereof, \nto be merged with and to be available for the same purposes, and \nfor the same time period, as the appropriation or fund to which \ntransferred: Provided, That such authority to transfer may not be \nused unless for higher priority items, based on unforeseen military \nrequirements, than those for which originally appropriated and in \nno case where the item for which funds are requested has been \ndenied by the Congress . . . Provided further, That no part of the \nfunds in this Act shall be available to prepare or present a request \nto the Committees on Appropriations for reprogramming of funds, \nunless for higher priority items, based on unforeseen military \nrequirements, than those for which originally appropriated and in \n \n   35     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 36 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 36 of 105\n“higher priority items, based on unforeseen military requirements, than those for \nwhich originally appropriated.”  Id.  And “in no case” may the Secretary use the \nfunds “where the item for which reprogramming is requested has been denied by \nthe Congress.”  Id.  We conclude, as Plaintiffs argue, that those requirements are \nnot satisfied. \ni.  “Unforeseen” \nPlaintiffs argue that the President’s repeated and unsuccessful requests for \nmore border barrier funding make the request here obviously not unforeseen.  \nDefendants assert in response, without citation, that “[a]n expenditure is \n‘unforeseen’ . . . if DoD was not aware of the specific need when it made its \nbudgeting requests.”  Defendants contend that DoD could not have foreseen the \n“need to provide support” to DHS for border barrier construction in the relevant \nsectors when it made its budget requests for 2019, before DHS’s own budget was \neven finalized.  \n  Defendants mistakenly focus on the assertion that DoD “could not have \nanticipated that DHS would request specific support for roads, fences, and \nlighting.”  Even assuming that is true, the fact remains that DHS came to DoD for \nfunds because Congress refused to grant DHS itself those funds.  And when \n                                           \nno case where the item for which reprogramming is requested has \nbeen denied by the Congress. \n   36     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 37 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 37 of 105\nproperly viewed as applying to the broader “requirement” of a border wall, not to \nDHS’s specific need to turn to an entity other than Congress for funds, it is not \ncredible that DoD did not foresee this requirement.  The long history of the \nPresident’s efforts to build a border barrier and of Congress’s refusing to \nappropriate the funds he requested makes it implausible that this need was \nunforeseen. \nii.  “Denied by the Congress” \n  Even if there could be doubt about how to interpret “unforeseen,” it is clear \nthat Congress denied this request.  Because each of section 8005’s conditions must \nbe satisfied for DoD’s reprogramming and spending to be constitutionally \npermissible, this conclusion alone undermines Defendants’ likelihood of success \non the merits on appeal.  \nDefendants urge that “an ‘item for which funds are requested’” refers to “a \nparticular budget item” for section 8005 purposes, so “Congress’s decisions with \nrespect to DHS’s more general request for border-wall funding [are] irrelevant.”  \nBut this interpretation, which would require that a specific funding request be \nexplicitly rejected by Congress, is not compatible with the plain text of section \n8005.  First, the statute refers to “item[s] . . . denied by the Congress,” not to \nfunding requests denied by the Congress, suggesting that the inquiry centers on \nwhat DoD wishes to spend the funds on, not on the form in which Congress \n   37     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 38 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 38 of 105\nconsidered whether to permit such spending.  Second, Defendants give the term \n“denied” a meaning other than its “ordinary, contemporary, and common” one.  \nUnited States v. Iverson, 162 F.3d 1015, 1022 (9th Cir. 1998).  In common usage, a \ngeneral denial of something requested can, and in this case does, encompass more \nspecific or narrower forms of that request.  To illustrate, if someone offered a new \njob asks her potential future employer for a larger compensation package than was \nincluded in the job offer and the request is denied, she has been denied a five \npercent higher salary even if her request did not specifically ask for that amount.   \nAs the district court noted, Defendants’ reading of section 8005 also would \nproduce the perverse result that DoD could, by declining to present Congress with \na particular line item to deny, reprogram funds for a purpose that Congress refused \nto grant another agency elsewhere in the budgeting process.18  In other words, it \nwould simply invite creative repackaging.  But putting a gift in different wrapping \npaper does not change the gift.  Identifying the request to Congress as having come \npreviously from DHS instead of from DoD does not change what funding was \nrequested for: a wall along the southern border. \nConstruing section 8005 with an eye towards the ordinary and \ncommon-sense meaning of “denied,” real-world events in the months and years \n                                           \n18 That result would hardly comport with Congress’s stated desire in drafting \nthe language currently in section 8005 “to tighten congressional control of the \nreprogramming process.”  H.R. Rep. No. 93-662, at 16 (1973). \n   38     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 39 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 39 of 105\nleading up to the 2019 appropriations bills leave no doubt that Congress considered \nand denied appropriations for the border barrier construction projects that DoD \nnow seeks to finance using its section 8005 authority.  Long before the emergency \ndeclaration and DoD’s reprogramming at issue here, the President made plain his \ndesire to construct a border barrier, requesting $5.7 billion from Congress to do so.  \nThroughout 2018, Congress considered multiple bills that would have supported \nconstruction of such a barrier; it passed none of them.  See supra Section I.  \nThat DoD never specifically requested from Congress the specific sums at \nissue here for the specific purpose of counterdrug funding at the southern border \n(and that Congress therefore never had cause to deny that specific request) is of no \nmoment.  The amount to be appropriated for a border barrier occupied center stage \nof the budgeting process for months, culminating in a prolonged government \nshutdown that both the Legislative and Executive Branches clearly understood as \nhinging on whether Congress would accede to the President’s request for $5.7 \nbillion to build a border barrier.     \nIn sum, Congress considered the “item” at issue here—a physical barrier \nalong the entire southern border, including in the Yuma, El Paso, Tucson, and El \nCentro sectors—and decided in a transparent process subject to great public \nscrutiny to appropriate less than the total amount the President had sought for that \nitem.  To call that anything but a “denial” is not credible.   \n   39     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 40 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 40 of 105\n2. Defendants’ Interpretation and Agency Deference \nDefendants did not argue in their briefing to the district court, their stay \nmotion, or their supplemental briefing that their contrary interpretation of section \n8005 is entitled to agency deference.  Even setting aside whether Defendants’ \nfailure to raise such an argument may operate as a waiver or forfeiture, we \nconclude that their position is unworthy of deference when evaluated under \ntraditional standards for reviewing agency action. \nUnder the two-step framework articulated in Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. \nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984), a reviewing court \nwill often defer to an agency’s interpretation of an ambiguous statute administered \nby the agency.  Id. at 843.  To determine whether the Chevron framework governs \nat all, however, there is a threshold “step zero” inquiry in which we ask whether “it \nappears that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules \ncarrying the force of law, and [whether] the agency interpretation claiming \ndeference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.”  United States v. \nMead Corp., 533 U.S. 218, 226-27 (2001).  “Delegation of such authority may be \nshown in a variety of ways, [such] as by an agency’s power to engage in \nadjudication or notice-and-comment rulemaking, or by some other indication of a \ncomparable congressional intent.”  Id. at 227.  And to evaluate whether the agency \nexercised its authority, we look to “the interpretive method used and the nature of \n   40     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 41 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 41 of 105\nthe question at issue,” considerations that may include “the interstitial nature of the \nlegal question, the related expertise of the [a]gency, the importance of the question \nto administration of the statute, the complexity of that administration, and the \ncareful consideration the [a]gency has given the question over a long period of \ntime.”  Barnhart v. Walton, 535 U.S. 212, 222 (2002).  If we determine that (1) \nCongress did not intend to delegate interpretive authority to the agency, or (2) that \nthe agency did not take the challenged action in exercise of that authority, we defer \nto the agency only to the extent that the agency’s reasoning is persuasive.  Mead, \n533 U.S. at 234 (citing Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134 (1944)). \nUnder this framework, DoD’s current interpretation of section 8005 is not \nentitled to deference.  First, it does not appear that Congress intended to delegate to \nDoD the power to interpret section 8005.  DoD’s authorizing and appropriating \nstatutes do not contain an explicit grant of rulemaking power to the agency.  \nSection 8005 could suggest a potential congressional intent to delegate to DoD the \nauthority to interpret the phrase “higher priority items, based on unforeseen \nmilitary requirements,” because these are subjects about which DoD has expertise.  \nBut the same is not true of the “denied by the Congress” limitation, given that DoD \nhas no clear expertise in assessing what “denied by the Congress” might mean.  \nMoreover, as discussed above, Congress’s intent in inserting the “denied by the \n   41     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 42 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 42 of 105\nCongress” limitation in the first place was to tighten the fiscal reins and retain \ncongressional control over the appropriations process.  See supra n.18. \nSecond, the agency has not advanced its interpretation in a manner that \nwould typically trigger review under Chevron.  There is no question that DoD did \nnot conduct notice-and-comment rulemaking or other formalized procedures in \ninterpreting section 8005.  See Mead, 533 U.S. at 230 (“[T]he overwhelming \nnumber of our cases applying Chevron deference have reviewed the fruits of \nnotice-and-comment rulemaking or formal adjudication.”).  Nor were there any \nother features in DoD’s interpretive process here that might otherwise justify \nChevron deference.  See Barnhart, 535 U.S. at 222.  There is no indication that \nDoD’s decision was the product of “careful consideration . . . over a long period of \ntime” or any other procedural rigor that would more closely approximate a formal \nrulemaking.  Id.  On the contrary, DoD’s interpretation appears to have emerged in \na matter of weeks.  And to the extent that DoD has mustered further support for its \ninterpretation during this litigation, that litigating position is not entitled to \nChevron deference.  Price v. Stevedoring Servs. of Am., Inc., 697 F.3d 820, 830 \n(9th Cir. 2012) (en banc) (“Without a basis in agency regulations or other binding \nagency interpretations, there is usually no justification for attributing to an agency \nlitigating position ‘the force of law.’” (quoting Mead, 533 U.S. at 227)).  \n   42     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 43 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 43 of 105\nAccordingly, we conclude that Chevron deference to DoD’s interpretation of \nsection 8005 is not warranted. \n  An agency action not entitled to Chevron deference may nevertheless carry \npersuasive weight based on the factors that the Supreme Court enumerated in \nSkidmore, 323 U.S. at 140.  See Mead, 533 U.S. at 234-35.  Under Skidmore, we \nlook to “the thoroughness evident in [the agency’s] consideration, the validity of its \nreasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those \nfactors which give it power to persuade.”  323 U.S. at 140.   \nDoD’s interpretation of section 8005 does not warrant deference under \nSkidmore’s standards either.  The two documents in the record that appear to \ncontain DoD’s analysis of the section 8005 requirements—the official \nreprogramming action and a related memorandum to DoD’s comptroller—are \nentirely conclusory.  The reprogramming action merely parrots the statute without \nanalysis:  \nThis reprogramming action provides funding in support of higher \npriority items, based on unforeseen military requirements, than those \nfor which originally appropriated; and is determined to be necessary \nin the national interest.  It meets all administrative and legal \nrequirements, and none of the items has previously been denied by the \nCongress. \nThe memorandum contains little more, stating that “[t]he need to provide \nsupport . . . was . . . not known at the time of the [Fiscal Year] 2019 budget \nrequest” and that Congress had not denied funding for the items.  The Supreme \n   43     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 44 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 44 of 105\nCourt has found unpersuasive under Skidmore agency determinations containing \nfar more reasoning than that which we confront here.  See Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 \nU.S. 243, 253-54 (2006) (rejecting as unpersuasive under Skidmore an interpretive \nrule announced by the Attorney General that “[i]ncorporat[ed] the legal analysis of \na memorandum he had solicited from his Office of Legal Counsel”); Christensen v. \nHarris County, 529 U.S. 576, 581, 587 (2000) (rejecting as unpersuasive under \nSkidmore an interpretation in an opinion letter containing brief textual analysis and \ncitation to operative regulations).   \nDefendants’ interpretation also fails to rest on the sort of expertise that might \ninspire deference.  See Gonzales, 546 U.S. at 269 (“[Skidmore] deference here is \ntempered by the Attorney General’s lack of expertise in this area.”); cf. Kisor v. \nWilkie, No. 18-15, 2019 WL 2605554, at *9 (U.S. June 26, 2019) (explaining that \nwhen an agency interprets its own regulation, its “interpretation must in some way \nimplicate its substantive expertise” to be entitled to deference); compare Mead, \n533 U.S. at 235 (“There is room at least to raise a Skidmore claim here, where . . . \n[the agency] can bring the benefit of specialized experience to bear on the subtle \nquestions in this case.”). \n* * * \nWithout section 8005’s statutory authorization to reprogram funds for \nsection 284 security measures, no congressional action permits Defendants to use \n   44     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 45 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 45 of 105\nthose funds to construct border barriers.  “The President’s power . . . must stem \neither from an act of Congress or from the Constitution itself.  There is no statute \nthat expressly authorizes the President to [act] as he did here.  Nor is there any act \nof Congress to which our attention has been directed from which such a power can \nfairly be implied.”  Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 585.  Defendants’ attempt to \nreprogram and spend these funds therefore violates the Appropriations Clause and \nintrudes on Congress’s exclusive power of the purse, for it would cause funds to be \n“drawn from the Treasury” not “in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.”  \nU.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 7.   \nB. Whether Plaintiffs Have a Cause of Action \nDefendants argue that none of the foregoing analysis matters because \nPlaintiffs lack a cause of action to challenge the reprogramming of funds at issue \nhere.  We disagree.  Plaintiffs may bring their challenge through an equitable \naction to enjoin unconstitutional official conduct, or under the judicial review \nprovisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq., as \na challenge to a final agency decision that is alleged to violate the Constitution, or \nboth.  Either way, Plaintiffs have an avenue for seeking relief. \n1.

Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 135 S. Ct. 1378, 1384 (2015); see \nalso Corr. Servs. Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U.S. 61, 74 (2001) (“[I]njunctive relief has \nlong been recognized as the proper means for preventing entities from acting \nunconstitutionally.”).  “The ability to sue to enjoin unconstitutional actions by state \nand federal officers is the creation of courts of equity, and reflects a long history of \njudicial review of illegal executive action, tracing back to England.”  Armstrong, \n135 S. Ct. at 1384; see also Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo S.A. v. All. Bond Fund, \nInc., 527 U.S. 308, 318-19 (1999) (“[T]he substantive prerequisites for obtaining \nan equitable remedy as well as the general availability of injunctive relief . . . \ndepend on traditional principles of equity jurisdiction.” (quoting 11A Charles Alan \nWright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure § 2941, at 31 (2d ed. 1995)).  \nIn Youngstown, for example, the Supreme Court heard a challenge to a \nwartime presidential order directing the Secretary of Commerce to seize and \noperate a majority of the nation’s steel mills.  343 U.S. at 582.  Acting pursuant to \nthe presidential order, the Secretary of Commerce issued possessory orders that \nrequired the seized companies to operate according to the Secretary’s direction.  Id. \nat 583.  The plaintiff steel mill owners challenged the order as amounting to \nlawmaking, a function that “the Constitution has expressly confided to the \nCongress and not to the President.”  Id. at 582.

Id. at \n587.  The Court therefore held that “th[e] seizure order [could not] stand.”  Id. at \n589. \nMore recently, in Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392 (2018), the Supreme \nCourt heard a challenge to a presidential proclamation restricting the entry of \ncertain foreign nationals into the United States on the ground that it violated the \nEstablishment Clause of the First Amendment.  Id. at 2403.  Plaintiffs were \nindividuals who alleged that they were injured by being separated from relatives \nbarred from entering the country.  Id. at 2416.  Without discussing whether a cause \nof action existed to challenge the alleged constitutional violation, the Court \nreached the merits of the plaintiffs’ Establishment Clause claim.  See id. at \n2416-17.  The government had contended that the plaintiffs’ claims were not \njusticiable because the Establishment Clause did not give them a legally protected \ninterest in the admission of particular foreign nationals, but the Court rejected this \nargument and proceeded to evaluate the merits of the plaintiffs’ claim.  Id. at 2416.  \nTrump v. Hawaii and Youngstown therefore support the conclusion that Plaintiffs \nmay seek equitable relief to remedy an alleged constitutional violation.  \n   47     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 48 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 48 of 105\nConsistent with these cases, our court allowed an equitable action to enforce \nthe Appropriations Clause in United States v. McIntosh, 833 F.3d 1163 (9th Cir. \n2016).  In McIntosh, appellants were criminal defendants who had been federally \nindicted on marijuana-related offenses.  Id. at 1168-69.  They sought to enjoin their \nprosecutions, claiming that a congressional appropriations rider prohibited the \nDepartment of Justice (“DOJ”) from spending money on their prosecutions \nbecause their marijuana-related activities were licensed under state law.  Id. at \n1169, 1177.  We held that the defendant-appellants could properly “enjoin their \nprosecutions on the grounds that [DOJ] [was] prohibited from spending funds to \nprosecute them” if they could demonstrate that their conduct was authorized by \nstate law and thus fell within what the appropriations rider was enacted to protect.  \nId. at 1169, 1174.  As we explained: “Congress has enacted an appropriations rider \nthat specifically restricts DOJ from spending money to pursue certain activities,” \nand it had acted within its “‘exclusive province’” in doing so.  Id. at 1172 (quoting \nTenn. Valley Auth. v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153, 194 (1978)).  Once Congress has so acted, \n“it is for . . . the courts to enforce” its decisions.  Id. (quoting Tenn. Valley Auth., \n437 U.S. at 194).  Contrary to the dissent’s characterization, we did not in \nMcIntosh treat the alleged constitutional violation only “as a defense for criminal \ndefendants.”  Dissent at 21.  Instead we held that “Appellants . . . can seek—and \n   48     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 49 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 49 of 105\nhave sought—to enjoin [an agency] from spending funds” contrary to Congress’s \nrestrictions.  McIntosh, 833 F.3d at 1172. \nRelying on Dalton v. Specter, 511 U.S. 462 (1994), Defendants argue that \nthere cannot be a constitutional cause of action here.  Dalton involved a challenge \nto the President’s discretionary decision to agree to a specific military base closure \nincluded in a base closure package proposed by an independent commission \npursuant to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (“DBCRA”).  \nId. at 464-66.  The Supreme Court held that the plaintiff’s statutory challenge to \nthe President’s decision failed because the statute gave the President unfettered \ndiscretion.  Id. at 474-76.  The Court then also rejected the argument that because \nthe President had allegedly violated the statute, he had acted unconstitutionally.  Id. \nat 472-74.  In explanation, the Court stated that “every action by the President, or \nby another executive official, in excess of his statutory authority is [not] ipso facto \nin violation of the Constitution.”  Id. at 472.  The Court did not say, however, that \naction in excess of statutory authority can never violate the Constitution or give \nrise to a constitutional claim.  Statutory and constitutional claims are not mutually \nexclusive.  Indeed, the Court went on in Dalton to state that Youngstown “cannot \nbe read for the proposition that an action taken by the President in excess of his \nstatutory authority necessarily violates the Constitution.”  Id. at 473 (emphasis \n   49     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 50 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 50 of 105\nadded).  There would have been no reason for the Court to include the word \n“necessarily” if the two claims were always mutually exclusive. \nIn Dalton, the President’s authority was put at issue because of the \ncontention that he had violated requirements set by DBCRA.  It was only because \nCongress had enacted a statutory process for closing bases that the Court \nconsidered whether it could review the President’s compliance with DBCRA and \nultimately concluded that it could not because the statute gave the President \nunreviewable discretion.  Id. at 474-76.  It was in that context that the Court \nexplained that an allegation that the President had not complied with the statute \nwould not necessarily become a constitutional claim through an ultra vires theory.  \nId. at 472-73.  Because DBCRA authorized unfettered discretion by the President \nto either approve or disapprove the package of base closures as a whole, the Court \nhad no occasion to consider the constitutional implications of violating statutes, \nsuch as section 8005, that authorize executive action contingent on satisfaction of \ncertain requirements.19  Here, unlike in Dalton, Plaintiffs’ claim is not one “simply \nalleging that the President has exceeded his statutory authority.”  Id. at 473 \n                                           \n19 The dissent notes that when Congress appropriates funds in lump-sum \namounts, and leaves it to the unfettered discretion of the agency to re-allocate \nfunds, no judicial review is available.  Dissent at 8 (citing Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 \nU.S. 182, 193 (1993)).  That principle has no bearing here.  Section 8005 does not \ninvolve a lump sum whose allocation is committed to the agency’s discretion, but \ninstead imposes restrictions on when and for what purposes the agency may use \nreprogrammed funds. \n   50     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 51 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 51 of 105\n(emphasis added).  Rather, Plaintiffs claim that to the extent Defendants did not \nhave statutory authority to reprogram the funds, they acted in violation of \nconstitutional separation of powers principles because Defendants lack any \nbackground constitutional authority to appropriate funds—making Plaintiffs’ claim \nfundamentally a constitutional one.20  Dalton therefore does not foreclose \nPlaintiffs’ constitutional claim here.21 \n                                           \n20 Defendants rely on Harrington v. Schlesinger, 528 F.2d 455 (4th Cir. \n1975), in which the Fourth Circuit held that the claims of several individual \ntaxpayers who alleged that the government was spending money in violation of \ntwo statutes did not satisfy the test for taxpayer standing enunciated in Flast v. \nCohen, 392 U.S. 83 (1968), because they “present[ed] no constitutional challenge \nto any congressional appropriation,” Harrington, 528 F.2d at 457.  Harrington is \nlargely inapposite, because Plaintiffs do not rely on taxpayer standing here.  The \ncourt in Harrington noted, however, that “[i]f there were a clear and flagrant \nviolation of congressional limitations upon expenditures, a court in a taxpayer suit \nmight find its intervention appropriate.” Id. at 458.  Thus, if Harrington has any \npersuasive value here, we think it is in suggesting that Plaintiffs do have a cause of \naction because, as we have discussed, there has been a clear violation of Congress’ \nlimits on expenditures. \n21 The dissent suggests that Train v. City of New York, 420 U.S. 35 (1975), \nsupports the proposition that a claim attacking the Executive Branch’s reading of \nan appropriations statute sounds only in that statute and not in the Constitution.  \nDissent at 8-9.  But the plaintiffs in Train argued not that the Executive Branch \nwas spending money that Congress had never appropriated, rather that the \nExecutive Branch was refusing to allot money Congress had specifically instructed \nit to spend.  420 U.S. at 42.  There was thus no constitutional claim at issue in \nTrain, and if there had been, it would have had nothing to do with the prohibitions \non unauthorized spending imposed by the Appropriations Clause.  The Supreme \nCourt in Train considered only the statutory question whether an Executive Branch \nagency had failed to comply with a specific statutory mandate because that was the \nonly issue in that case, not because the existence of a statute had any bearing on \nconstitutional reviewability. \n \n   51     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 52 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 52 of 105\nDefendants also cannot be right in their apparent contention that as long as \nan official identifies some statutory authorization for his actions, doing so makes \nany challenge to those actions statutory and precludes constitutional review.  It \ncannot be that simply by pointing to any statute, governmental defendants can \nforeclose a constitutional claim.  At the risk of sounding tautological, only if the \nstatute actually permits the action can it even possibly give authority for that \naction.22  For the reasons explained above, section 8005 does not permit the action \nhere.   \nCongress may, of course, limit a court’s equitable power to enjoin acts \nviolating federal law.  See Armstrong, 135 S. Ct. at 1385 (explaining that an \nequitable remedy is not available where Congress has demonstrated an “intent to \nforeclose” that form of relief, as where a statutory provision (1) expressly provided \na method of enforcing a substantive right, or (2) lacked a judicially administrable \nstandard (quoting Verizon Md., Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm’n of Md., 535 U.S. 635, \n647 (2002))).  But Defendants do not argue that Congress has demonstrated any \n                                           \n22 Although in Youngstown the President conceded that no statute authorized \nhis actions, and relied only on his Article II powers, 343 U.S. at 587, we do not see \nhow Defendants’ willingness or unwillingness to concede that a particular statute \ndoes not authorize their actions should affect whether Plaintiffs in this case have a \ncause of action—particularly when, as we have discussed, we think it quite clear \nthat section 8005 does not authorize the reprogramming.  Thus, we do not think \nthat the concession in Youngstown was determinative, or that the lack of a \nconcession is determinative here.   \n   52     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 53 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 53 of 105\nsuch intent to limit equitable remedies here, and we have identified no statute that \ndoes so.  Indeed, to foreclose a remedy for a constitutional violation, Congress \nmust demonstrate its intent by “clear and convincing evidence.”  Weinberger v. \nSalfi, 422 U.S. 749, 762 (1975) (quoting Johnson v. Robinson, 415 U.S. 361, 373 \n(1974)); see also City of Chicago v. Int’l Coll. of Surgeons, 522 U.S. 156, 183 \n(1997) (“[J]udicial review of [federal] administrative action is the rule, and \nnonreviewability an exception which must be demonstrated.” (alterations in \noriginal) (quoting Barlow v. Collins, 397 U.S. 159, 166 (1970)).  \n2. Administrative Procedure Act Cause of Action \nPlaintiffs’ claim is also cognizable under the APA.  The APA provides for \njudicial review of “[a]gency action made reviewable by statute and final agency \naction for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.”  5 U.S.C. § 704.  \nHere, Plaintiffs have a cause of action under the APA as long as there has been \nfinal agency action, and as long as Congress has not limited review of such actions \nthrough other statutes or committed them to agency discretion.  Neither of these \nbars to APA relief is present here.  See 5 U.S.C. §§ 701(a), 704, 706; Bennett v. \nSpear, 520 U.S. 154, 175 (1997). \nThe APA mandates that a court “shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside \nagency action . . . found to be . . . contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, \nor immunity.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B).  Plaintiffs’ challenge is to a final agency \n   53     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 54 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 54 of 105\naction and alleges that the action violates the Appropriations Clause, so it falls \nwithin the APA’s scope.23 \nAlthough section 701(a)(2) of the APA “preclude[s] judicial review of \ncertain categories of administrative decisions,” this case does not involve such an \n“administrative decision traditionally regarded as committed to agency discretion.”  \nLincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 191-92 (1993).  In their emergency stay motion and \nrelated supplemental briefing, Defendants do not argue that DoD’s actions were \ncommitted to “agency discretion by law,” so as to preclude review under the APA.  \nWe agree with Defendants’ implicit concession that this is not a case involving a \n“statute . . . drawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard against \nwhich to judge the agency’s exercise of discretion.”  Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. \n821, 830 (1985).   \nAny constitutional challenge that Plaintiffs may advance under the APA \nwould exist regardless of whether they could also assert an APA claim that DoD’s \n                                           \n23 Defendants argue that DoD’s reprogramming action is not a final agency \naction in part because it “imposes no obligations and confers no rights upon \nplaintiffs.” Exec. Tan Br. at 14.  But the question we must ask in determining \nfinality is whether the agency action imposes obligations on the agency, not \nwhether it imposes obligations on Plaintiffs.  See Bennett, 520 U.S. at 177 (holding \nthat the challenged agency actions were final because they “alter[ed] the legal \nregime to which the action agency [wa]s subject” (emphasis added)).  Here, as we \nhave discussed, the reprogramming action purports to affect DoD’s legal right to \nuse particular funds to build a border barrier instead of the purpose for which they \nwere originally appropriated.  \n   54     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 55 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 55 of 105\napplication of section 8005 was “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or \nlimitations, or short of statutory right.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C); see Webster v. Doe, \n486 U.S. 592, 602-04 (1988) (holding that a plaintiff may raise under the APA a \nconstitutional challenge to agency action even where the plaintiff lacks an avenue \nunder the APA to argue that the same agency action is invalid for statutory or \nprocedural reasons).  If “Congress intends to preclude judicial review of \nconstitutional claims[,] its intent to do so must be clear.”  Webster, 487 U.S. at 603.  \nCongress has not done so here.   \n3. Survival of at Least One Cause of Action \nThe dissent argues that Plaintiffs’ claim is necessarily one encompassed by \nthe APA, and that the availability of an APA cause of action precludes Plaintiffs’ \nequitable claim.  We do not think that the APA forecloses Plaintiffs’ equitable \nclaim.  And even if it did, then for the reasons we have discussed, Plaintiffs would \nhave an APA claim.  Either way, it cannot be that both an equitable claim and an \nAPA claim foreclose the other, leaving Plaintiffs with no recourse.   \nIt is true that the APA is the general mechanism by which to challenge final \nagency action.  See Weyerhaeuser Co. v. U.S. Fish & Wildlife Serv., 139 S. Ct. \n361, 370 (2018) (noting the “basic presumption of judicial review [created by the \nAPA] for one ‘suffering legal wrong because of agency action’” (quoting Abbott \nLabs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 140 (1967)).  But this does not mean the APA \n   55     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 56 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 56 of 105\nforecloses other causes of action.  In Navajo Nation v. Department of the Interior, \n876 F.3d 1144 (9th Cir. 2017), we explained that “a court is foreclosed by [APA \nsection] 704 from entertaining claims brought under the APA seeking review of \nnon-final agency action (and not otherwise permitted by law),” but that this final \nagency action limitation does not apply “to other types of claims (like . . . \nconstitutional claims).”  Id. at 1170.   \nLikewise, in Presbyterian Church v. United States, 870 F.2d 518 (9th Cir. \n1989), we allowed constitutional claims to proceed without even deciding whether \nan APA cause of action was available.  There, plaintiff churches brought claims for \ninjunctive relief against the United States, DOJ, and the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service (“INS”) and certain INS officials, alleging violations of \ntheir First and Fourth Amendment rights by INS agents’ surreptitious recording of \ntheir church services.  Id. at 520.  The district court dismissed the plaintiffs’ claims \nas, in relevant part, barred by sovereign immunity.  Id. at 521.  We reversed, \nholding that APA section 702 waived the government defendants’ sovereign \nimmunity for claims seeking non-monetary relief.  Id. at 523-24.  We further \nexplained that this waiver of sovereign immunity was not limited to suits involving \nan “agency action” as defined under the APA.  Id. at 525.  We therefore did not \nreach the question whether the actions challenged in that case were ones for which \nthe APA would provide a cause of action.  Id. at 525 n.8.  Rather, we remanded for \n   56     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 57 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 57 of 105\nfurther analysis of standing and mootness, and, if the district court determined it \nhad jurisdiction, for evaluation of the plaintiffs’ constitutional claims.  Id. at 529.  \nNavajo Nation and Presbyterian Church clearly contemplate that claims \nchallenging agency actions—particularly constitutional claims—may exist wholly \napart from the APA.   \nIn fact, the APA provides for judicial review only of “[a]gency action made \nreviewable by statute and final agency action for which there is no other adequate \nremedy in a court.”  5 U.S.C. § 704.  Here, no statute expressly makes Plaintiffs’ \nclaims reviewable, but, as we have explained, Plaintiffs do have an adequate \nremedy in a court: an equitable cause of action for injunctive relief.  If either form \nof their claim precludes the other, it would therefore seem that their equitable \nclaim to enjoin unconstitutional action would preclude their APA claim to enjoin \nunconstitutional action.  But even if it is the other way around, these causes of \naction cannot possibly be the legal equivalent of baking soda and vinegar—when \nthey come in contact, there is no reason to believe they both go up in smoke.  \nC. Zone of Interests \nDefendants argue that even if a cause of action generally exists to challenge \nthe reprogramming, Plaintiffs must satisfy a “zone of interests” test to establish \nthat they, specifically, have a cause of action for the constitutional violation they \nallege here.  Defendants argue that this test would apply to Plaintiffs’ claim \n   57     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 58 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 58 of 105\nwhether characterized as an equitable cause of action to enjoin a constitutional \nviolation or as an APA claim.  We are doubtful that a zone of interests test applies \nto Plaintiffs’ equitable cause of action.  Although we recognize that the APA \ngenerally does carry a zone of interests test, there is some lack of clarity with \nrespect to what that might look like in a constitutional context.  We need not \nresolve these ambiguities in the case law, however, because we believe Plaintiffs \nfall within any zone of interests test that may apply. \n1. Applicability of a Zone of Interests Test \nCourts apply the zone of interests test to “determine, using traditional tools \nof statutory interpretation, whether a legislatively conferred cause of action \nencompasses a particular plaintiff’s claim.”  Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static Control \nComponents, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 127 (2014).  To determine whether a plaintiff \nsatisfies this test we ask whether the plaintiff’s “interests fall within the zone of \ninterests protected by the law invoked.”  Id. at 129 (quotation marks omitted).  In \nanswering this question, we recognize that “the breadth of the [applicable] zone of \ninterests varies according to the provisions of law at issue.”  Id. at 130 (quoting \nBennett, 520 U.S. at 163).     \nThe zone of interests test derives from the Supreme Court’s decision in \nAssociation of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150 \n(1970), where the Court articulated a limit on causes of action conferred by the \n   58     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 59 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 59 of 105\nAPA.  But the Court clarified in Lexmark that the test “applies to all statutorily \ncreated causes of action . . . and that Congress is presumed to ‘legislate against the \nbackground of’ the zone-of-interests limitation, ‘which applies unless it is \nexpressly negated.’”  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 129 (emphasis added) (quoting Bennett, \n520 U.S. at 163).24  \nWe are doubtful that any zone of interests test applies to Plaintiffs’ equitable \ncause of action to enjoin a violation of the Appropriations Clause, particularly after \nLexmark.   \nAs an initial matter, we are skeptical that there could be a zone of interests \nrequirement for a claim alleging that official action was taken in the absence of all \nauthority, like that which Plaintiffs assert here.  The D.C. Circuit’s decision in \nHaitian Refugee Center v. Gracey, 809 F.2d 794 (D.C. Cir. 1987), explains why it \ndoes not make sense to treat such claims as carrying a zone of interests \nrequirement.  There, the court heard a challenge to a government program for \n                                           \n24 Many pre-Lexmark cases refer to the zone of interests test—and the \nbroader question whether a particular plaintiff has a cause of action—as a part of \nthe standing inquiry (and, more specifically, as a component of “prudential \nstanding”).  See Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 126-27.  In Lexmark, however, the Court \nclarified that the zone of interests test does not go to a plaintiff’s standing but \nrather to whether the plaintiff has a cause of action.  Id. at 127, 128 n.4.  The Court \nsuggested that holding otherwise would be “in some tension with [the Court’s] \nrecent affirmation of the principle that ‘a federal court’s obligation to hear and \ndecide’ cases within its jurisdiction ‘is virtually unflagging.’”  Id. at 126 (quoting \nSprint Commc’ns, Inc. v. Jacobs, 571 U.S. 69, 77 (2013). \n   59     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 60 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 60 of 105\nintercepting ships carrying undocumented immigrants, in which the plaintiffs \nargued that the program exceeded authority granted by statute or the Constitution.  \nId. at 797-98.  The court ultimately held that the plaintiffs lacked standing.  Id. at \n800-01.  But, citing Youngstown in its discussion, the D.C. Circuit noted that the \nplaintiffs were not required to “show that their interests [fell] within the zones of \ninterests of the constitutional and statutory powers invoked by the President in \norder to . . . challenge the . . . program as ultra vires.”  Id. at 811 n.14.  \n“Otherwise,” the court explained, “a meritorious litigant, injured by ultra \nvires action, would seldom have standing to sue since the litigant’s interest \nnormally will not fall within the zone of interests of the very statutory or \nconstitutional provision that he claims does not authorize action concerning that \ninterest.”  Id.  In other words, where the very claim is that no statutory or \nconstitutional provision authorized a particular governmental action, it makes little \nsense to ask whether any statutory or constitutional provision was written for the \nbenefit of any particular plaintiffs. \nConsistent with this logic, Youngstown did not apply a zone of interests test.  \nAlthough we acknowledge that Youngstown was decided before the Supreme Court \nhad formally articulated a zone of interests test, Youngstown did not address any \nsimilar concept, either.  Rather, the Court held that the President had unlawfully \nintruded on the lawmaking function reserved to Congress without ever discussing \n   60     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 61 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 61 of 105\nwhether the plaintiffs, steel mill owners whose property was ordered to be seized, \nwere the intended beneficiaries of the structural provisions in Article II.   \nSimilarly, in Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417 (1998), which \naddressed a Presentment Clause challenge, the Supreme Court said nothing about a \nzone of interests requirement.  In that case, two sets of plaintiffs challenged the \nconstitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act, which allowed the President to veto \nonly particular provisions in enacted laws, rather than the entire law.  Id. at 420-21.  \nOne set of plaintiffs consisted of the City of New York, a hospital and two hospital \nassociations, and unions representing hospital employees.  Id. at 425.  Another \nconsisted of a cooperative of Idaho potato growers, and an individual potato \nfarmer.  Id.  All the plaintiffs alleged that they were injured by the President’s \ncancellation of particular line items in the budget that would have inured to their \nfinancial benefit.  Id. at 421.  The Supreme Court held that the Act violated the \nstructural protections provided by the Presentment Clause, without asking whether \nthe plaintiffs fell within any zone of interests of that clause.  Id. at 436-48.   \nThe Appropriations Clause likewise operates as a structural protection built \ninto our constitutional system.  Just as the Court in Clinton treated as sufficient that \nthe plaintiffs were concretely injured as a result of the alleged Presentment Clause \nviolation, we believe it is likely sufficient here that Plaintiffs would be concretely \n   61     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 62 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 62 of 105\ninjured by the alleged Appropriations Clause violation, and that no zone of \ninterests test applies to their claim.   \nEven if a zone of interests test may have been applied to some cases \nconsidering constitutional claims like Plaintiffs’ prior to Lexmark, we think that \nLexmark has called into question its continuing applicability to constitutional \nclaims.  Lexmark focuses on Congress’s intent in creating statutory causes of \naction, casting doubt on Defendants’ argument that a zone of interests test has any \nrole to play here, where Plaintiffs’ theory derives from the Constitution.  The Court \nin Lexmark described the purpose of the zone of interests test as being to discern \nwhether a statutory cause of action exists—specifically, “whether a legislatively \nconferred cause of action encompasses a particular plaintiff’s claim.”  572 U.S. at \n127.  Because the Constitution was not created by any act of Congress, it is hard to \nsee how the zone of interests test would even apply.25   \n                                           \n25 Defendants argue that an equitable cause of action to enjoin a \nconstitutional violation is, at its root, a creation of statute, and is therefore \nencompassed within Lexmark’s references to causes of action created by statute.  \nAlthough Defendants are correct that Congress granted federal courts equity \njurisdiction by statute, see Grupo Mexicano, 527 U.S. at 318 (“The Judiciary Act \nof 1789 conferred on the federal courts jurisdiction over all suits . . . in equity.” \n(quotation marks omitted)); see also 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (“The district courts shall \nhave original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or \ntreaties of the United States.”), we think it a stretch to conclude that the traditional \nequitable cause of action to enjoin a constitutional violation was therefore created \nby statute.  Indeed, the lower federal courts are created entirely by statute, see An \nAct to Establish the Judicial Courts of the United States §§ 2-6, 1 Stat. 73 (1789), \n \n   62     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 63 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 63 of 105\nIndeed, in its recent decision in Tennessee Wine & Spirits Retailers Ass’n v. \nThomas, No. 18-96, 2019 WL 2605555 (U.S. June 26, 2019), in which the \nplaintiffs alleged a violation of the dormant Commerce Clause, the Supreme Court \ndid not even mention the zone of interests test.  Given that the Court did apply a \nzone of interests test in Boston Stock Exchange v. State Tax Commission, 429 U.S. \n318 (1977), a pre-Lexmark dormant Commerce Clause case, Tennessee Wine \nsupports the idea that Lexmark has changed the landscape.  See 429 U.S. at 602 \nn.3. \nFor all of these reasons, we doubt that any zone of interests test applies to \nPlaintiffs’ equitable cause of action. \nWe recognize that the Supreme Court has consistently applied a zone of \ninterests test to causes of action arising under the APA.  When the Court has \napplied the zone of interests test in APA actions, however, it has analyzed the zone \nof interests of the statute the agency is alleged to have violated, not any zone of \ninterests of the APA itself.  In Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi \nIndians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209 (2012), for example, the Court examined an APA \naction alleging that the government had exceeded its statutory authority to take title \n                                           \nbut this does not mean that all constitutional claims filed in a federal district court \nare really statutory claims.  See, e.g., Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. \nBureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 397 (1971) (recognizing “a cause of action \nunder the Fourth Amendment” for damages).   \n   63     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 64 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 64 of 105\nto a piece of property “for the purpose of providing land for Indians.”  Id. at 211 \n(quoting the Indian Reorganization Act, 25 U.S.C. § 465 (2012) (current version at \n25 U.S.C. § 5108)).  It concluded that the plaintiff, who lived near land that had \nbeen acquired by the Secretary of the Interior for an Indian tribe seeking to open a \ncasino, was “arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by” \nthe Indian Reorganization Act, which “authorize[d] the acquisition of property ‘for \nthe purpose of providing land for Indians.’”  Id. at 211-12, 224-26 (first quoting \nAss’n of Data Processing Serv. Orgs., 397 U.S. at 153, then quoting 25 U.S.C. \n§ 465 (2012) (current version at 25 U.S.C. § 5108)).  In so doing, it departed from \nthe reasoning of the district court, which had concluded that the plaintiff fell \noutside the Act’s zone of interests because he was “not an Indian, nor [did] he \npurport to seek to protect or vindicate the interests of any Indians or Indian tribes.”  \nPatchak v. Salazar, 646 F. Supp. 2d 72, 77 (D.D.C. 2009).  And in Air Courier \nConference of America v. American Postal Workers Union, 498 U.S. 517 (1991), \nthe Court asked whether postal workers bringing a claim under the APA were \nwithin the zone of interests protected by the Private Express Statutes on which \ntheir claims depended.26   \n                                           \n26 In Bennett, the Court noted that because the zone of interests test “varies \naccording to the provisions of law at issue, . . . what comes within the zone of \ninterests of a statute for purposes of obtaining judicial review . . . under the \n‘generous review provisions’ of the APA may not do so for other purposes.”  520 \n \n   64     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 65 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 65 of 105\nHere, rather than looking at a statute underlying an APA action to determine \nthe relevant zone of interests, we would need to look at the Appropriations Clause.  \nBecause, as we have discussed, we are doubtful that any zone of interests test \napplies to claims seeking to enjoin a violation of the Appropriations Clause, we \nthink it is possible that the present type of APA claim is distinct from typical APA \nclaims and that there is no zone of interests requirement here.  We need not decide \nthat question, however, because we believe that, even if a zone of interests test \napplied here, it would be satisfied.   \n2. Whether Any Zone of Interests Test Is Satisfied \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs cannot satisfy the zone of interests test \nbecause their claims fall outside the zone of interests of section 8005.  Although \nPlaintiffs’ Complaint did assert a claim under section 8005, it also asserted \nconstitutional claims, including a claim for a violation of the Appropriations \nClause.  To the extent any zone of interests test applies to that constitutional claim \n(whether brought in equity or under the APA), it requires us to ask whether \nPlaintiffs fall within the zone of interests of the Appropriations Clause, not of \nsection 8005.  And when the Supreme Court has applied a zone of interests test to \n                                           \nU.S. at 163 (quoting Clark v. Sec. Indus. Ass’n, 479 U.S. 388, 400 n.16 (1987)).  \nWe read this not to suggest that a particular zone of interests test applies to all \nAPA actions, but that when analyzing whether a plaintiff falls within the zone of \ninterests of a particular statute, courts should be particularly lenient if a violation of \nthat statute is being asserted through an APA claim.   \n   65     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 66 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 66 of 105\nclaims about structural provisions of the Constitution, it has applied a very lenient \nversion of that test.   \nFor example, in Boston Stock Exchange, the Court held that plaintiff \nbusinesses that alleged financial injury from a state tax that discriminated against \nout-of-state businesses fell within the zone of interests of the implied dormant \nCommerce Clause, which functions as a limit on a state’s power relative to that of \nCongress to regulate interstate commerce.  429 U.S. at 320 n.3.  Although the suit \nwas not brought by Congress seeking to protect its Commerce Clause authority, or \neven by another state alleging harm from the defendant state’s tax law, the Court \nheld that the plaintiffs were permitted to assert that the state defendant had acted in \na manner that infringed on Congress’s constitutional authority.  Id. \nMore recently, in McIntosh, we allowed criminal defendants charged with \nmarijuana-related offenses to seek an injunction prohibiting DOJ from spending \nfunds in violation of the Appropriations Clause.  833 F.3d at 1168, 1172.  We \nexplained: “When Congress has . . . expressly prohibit[ed] DOJ from spending \nfunds on certain actions, federal criminal defendants may seek to enjoin the \nexpenditure of those funds, and we may exercise jurisdiction over a district court’s \ndirect denial of a request for such injunctive relief.”  Id. at 1172-73.  To the extent \nwe implicitly applied a zone of interests test to the criminal defendants, it was not a \nrestrictive one—indeed, our primary concern was to confirm that the defendants \n   66     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 67 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 67 of 105\nhad standing to challenge the Appropriations Clause violation (and we concluded \nthey did).  Id. at 1173-74. \nAccordingly, if Plaintiffs must fall within a zone of interests served by the \nconstitutional provision they seek to vindicate, we are persuaded that they do.  The \nAppropriations Clause is a vital instrument of separation of powers, which has as \nits aim the protection of individual rights and liberties—not merely separation for \nseparation’s sake.  See supra section V.A.  As Justice Kennedy put it in Clinton:  \n[I]f a citizen who is taxed has the measure of the tax or the decision to \nspend determined by the Executive alone, without adequate control by \nthe citizen’s Representatives in Congress, liberty is threatened. . . .  \nThe individual loses liberty in a real sense if that instrument is not \nsubject to traditional constitutional constraints. \n524 U.S. at 451 (Kennedy, J., concurring).  Because “individuals, too, are \nprotected by the operations of separation of powers and checks and balances,” it \nfollows that “they are not disabled from relying on those principles in otherwise \njusticiable cases and controversies.”  Bond v. United States, 564 U.S. 211, 223 \n(2011).      \nPlaintiffs assert that if Defendants’ allegedly unconstitutional spending \nproceeds, they will suffer injuries to their environmental, professional, aesthetic, \nand recreational interests.  Those individual rights and interests resemble myriad \ninterests that the Supreme Court has concluded—either explicitly or tacitly—fall \nwithin any applicable zone of interests encompassed by structural constitutional \n   67     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 68 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 68 of 105\nprinciples like separation of powers.  See, e.g., Chadha, 462 U.S. at 935-36, \n951-52 (allowing a plaintiff with an interest in avoiding deportation to bring a \nconstitutional claim based on bicameralism and presentment requirements); Bos. \nStock Exch., 429 U.S. at 602 n.3 (allowing a plaintiff stock exchange with an \ninterest in avoiding a state tax to bring a claim enforcing Congress’s dominion over \nthe regulation of interstate commerce).  Plaintiffs’ claim that their rights or liberties \nwere infringed by a violation of the Appropriations Clause therefore falls within \nany zone of interests required to enforce that clause’s provisions.   \nVI.  The Remaining Stay Factors \nOur focus to this point has been on the first of the four factors to be \nconsidered in deciding a motion to stay, “whether the stay applicant has made a \nstrong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits.”  Nken v. Holder, 556 \nU.S. 418, 434 (2009).  The second factor, “whether the applicant will be \nirreparably injured absent a stay,” was identified in Nken together with the first \nfactor as “the most critical.”  Id.   \nThe Supreme Court observed in Nken that the third and fourth factors—\nwhether issuance of a stay will substantially injure other parties and where the \npublic interest lies—“merge when the Government is the opposing party.”  Id. at \n435.  That case involved an application for a stay of removal by a noncitizen who \nwas facing deportation.  The motion before us presents a variant on that situation.  \n   68     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 69 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 69 of 105\nHere, it is Defendants who seek a stay, so the question whether Defendants will be \nirreparably injured absent a stay may, in practical terms, merge with consideration \nof the public interest. \nPublic interest is a concept to be considered broadly.  The Court noted in \nNken, for example, that there is a public interest in “preventing aliens from being \nwrongfully removed,” but also that there is “always a public interest in prompt \nexecution of removal orders.”  Id. at 436. \nDefendants have discussed these three remaining factors together in terms of \nthe “equitable balance of harms.”  There is logic in that, so we will do the same, \nconsidering the respective impacts on Defendants, Plaintiffs and others interested \nin the proceedings, and the general public. \nThe primary harm cited by Defendants if a stay is not granted is that a “delay \nin the construction of border fencing pending appeal will create irreparable harm” \nbecause “deadly drugs [will] flow into this country in the interim.”  They argue \nthat CBP has recorded over 4,000 “drug-related events” between border crossings \nin the El Paso, El Centro, Tucson, and Yuma Sectors in Fiscal Year 2018 and cites \nCBP’s seizure of thousands of pounds of marijuana and lesser amounts of other \nillegal substances, including cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and fentanyl.  \nWe do not question in the slightest the scourge that is illegal drug trafficking \nand the public interest in combatting it.  Our circuit includes several border states, \n   69     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 70 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 70 of 105\nand our courts deal with no small number of cases involving illegal drugs crossing \nthose states’ borders. \nDefendants have not actually spoken to the more relevant questions, \nhowever.  What will be the impact of building the barriers they propose?  Even \nmore to the point, what would be the impact of delaying the construction of those \nbarriers?  If these specific leaks are plugged, will the drugs flow through \nsomewhere else?  We do not know, but the evidence before us does not support a \nconclusion that enjoining the construction of the proposed barriers until this appeal \nis fully resolved will have a significant impact. \nTo begin with, the statistics cited by Defendants describe drug trafficking \nthat CBP has detected with existing barriers and law enforcement efforts.  They do \nnot tell us how much gets through undetected or what additional amounts would be \nstopped by the proposed barriers.  \nAs Plaintiffs point out, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration’s \nmost recent assessment, the “majority of the [heroin] flow is through [privately \noperated vehicles] entering the United States at legal ports of entry, followed by \ntractor-trailers, where the heroin is co-mingled with legal goods.”  Drug \nEnforcement Admin., 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment 19 (2018), \nhttps://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/2018-11/DIR-032-\n18%202018%20NDTA%20final%20low%20resolution.pdf.  Only “a small \n   70     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 71 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 71 of 105\npercentage of all heroin seized by [CBP] along the land border was between Ports \nof Entry.”  Id.  Fentanyl transiting the southern border is likewise most commonly \nsmuggled in “multi-kilogram loads” in vehicles crossing at legal ports of entry.  Id. \nat 33.  Defendants have not disputed these assessments.   \nThat does not lead to a conclusion that leaks should not be plugged.  It does \nsuggest, however, that Defendants’ claim that failing to stay the injunction pending \nappeal will cause significant irreparable harm is supported by much less than meets \nthe eye.  Congress could have appropriated funds to construct these barriers if it \nconcluded that the expenditure was in the public interest, but it did not. \nFor similar reasons, we are unmoved by Defendants’ contention that “the \ninjunction threatens to permanently deprive DoD of its authorization to use the \nfunds at issue to complete” the selected projects, including “approximately $1.1 \nbillion it has transferred for these projects but has not yet obligated via \nconstruction contracts,” because “the funding will likely lapse during the appeal’s \npendency.”  A lapse in funding does not mean that the money will disappear from \nthe Treasury.  The country will still have that money.  It could be spent in the \nfuture, including through appropriations enacted by Congress for the next fiscal \nyear.  The lapse simply means that Defendants’ effort to justify spending those \nfunds based on the appropriations act for the current fiscal year and the authority to \nreprogram funds under section 8005 may be thwarted.   \n   71     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 72 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 72 of 105\nDefendants’ identification of this lapse as a factor that should tip the balance \nof harms in their favor actually serves instead to illustrate the underlying weakness \nin their position.  Defendants’ rush to spend this money is necessarily driven by \ntheir understanding that Congress did not appropriate requested funding for these \npurposes in the current budget and their expectation that Congress will not \nauthorize that spending in the next fiscal year, either.  The effort by Defendants to \nspend this money is not consistent with Congress’s power over the purse or with \nthe tacit assessment by Congress that the spending would not be in the public \ninterest. \nFinally, Defendants maintain that a stay is necessary because DoD “is \nincurring unrecoverable fees and penalties of hundreds of thousands of dollars to \nits contractors for each day that construction is suspended.”  But that liability \nresulted from Defendants’ own decisions about how to proceed in the face of \nlitigation.  Plaintiffs filed their motion for a preliminary injunction on April 4, \n2019, and a hearing was held on May 17.  When DoD awarded contracts on April \n9 for El Paso Project Sector 1, and May 15 for Yuma Project Sector 1 and Tucson \nProject Sectors 1-3, DoD knew this litigation was pending and that the district \ncourt had been asked to enter a preliminary injunction.  Placing significant weight \non financial obligations that Defendants knowingly undertook would, in effect, \nreward them for self-inflicted wounds. \n   72     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 73 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 73 of 105\nMoving to the impacts on the Plaintiffs, Defendants denigrate those impacts \nas limited to “aesthetic and recreational injuries.”  As noted above, see supra \nSection II, Defendants have elected not to dispute that Plaintiffs’ interests are \nsufficiently substantial to support Article III standing.  Environmental injuries have \nbeen held sufficient in many cases to support injunctions blocking substantial \ngovernment projects.  The Supreme Court has observed that “[e]nvironmental \ninjury, by its nature, can seldom be adequately remedied by money damages and is \noften permanent or at least of long duration, i.e., irreparable.  If such injury is \nsufficiently likely, therefore, the balance of harms will usually favor the issuance \nof an injunction to protect the environment.”  Amoco Prod. Co. v. Village of \nGambell, 480 U.S. 531, 545 (1987).  \nAs to the public interest, we conclude that the public interest weighs \nforcefully against issuing a stay.  The Constitution assigns to Congress the power \nof the purse.  Under the Appropriations Clause, it is Congress that is to make \ndecisions regarding how to spend taxpayer dollars.  As we have explained, see \nsupra Section V.C.2., the Appropriations Clause serves as a check by requiring \nthat “not a dollar of [money in the Treasury] can be used in the payment of any \nthing not thus previously sanctioned” by Congress,” as “[a]ny other course would \ngive to the fiscal officers a most dangerous discretion.”  Reeside v. Walker, 52 U.S. \n   73     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 74 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 74 of 105\n272, 291 (1850).  In the words of then-Judge Kavanaugh, the Appropriations \nClause is \na bulwark of the Constitution’s separation of powers \namong the three branches of the National Government.  It \nis particularly important as a restraint on Executive \nBranch officers: If not for the Appropriations Clause, the \nexecutive would possess an unbounded power over the \npublic purse of the nation; and might apply all its monied \nresources at his pleasure. \n  \nU.S. Dep’t of Navy v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth., 665 F.3d 1339, 1347 (D.C. Cir. \n2012) (Kavanaugh, J.) (quotation marks omitted).  The Clause prevents the \nExecutive Branch from “even inadvertently obligating the Government to pay \nmoney without statutory authority.”  Id.  The public interest in ensuring protection \nof this separation of powers is foundational and requires little elaboration.  See \nsupra Section V.A.   \nSimilarly, when Congress chooses how to address a problem, “[i]t is quite \nimpossible . . . to find secreted in the interstices of legislation the very grant of \npower which Congress consciously withheld,” as doing so is “not merely to \ndisregard in a particular instance the clear will of Congress,” but “to disrespect the \nwhole legislative process and the constitutional division of authority between \nPresident and Congress.”  Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 609 (1952) (Frankfurter, J., \nconcurring).  Congress did not appropriate money to build the border barriers \nDefendants seek to build here.  Congress presumably decided such construction at \n   74     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 75 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 75 of 105\nthis time was not in the public interest.  See id.; supra Section V.A.1.ii.  It is not \nfor us to reach a different conclusion. \nThe public interest and the balance of hardships do not support granting the \nmotion to stay.  \nVII.  Conclusion \nIn his concurrence in Youngstown, Justice Jackson made eloquent comments \nthat seem equally apt today: \nThe essence of our free Government is “leave to live by no man’s \nleave, underneath the law”—to be governed by those impersonal forces \nwhich we call law.  Our Government is fashioned to fulfill this concept so \nfar as humanly possible.  The Executive, except for recommendation and \nveto, has no legislative power.  The executive action we have here originates \nin the individual will of the President and represents an exercise of authority \nwithout law. . . .  With all its defects, delays and inconveniences, men have \ndiscovered no technique for long preserving free government except that the \nExecutive be under the law, and that the law be made by parliamentary \ndeliberations. \n \nSuch institutions may be destined to pass away. But it is the duty of \nthe Court to be last, not first, to give them up. \n \n343 U.S. at 654-55 (Jackson, J., concurring). \n  Heeding Justice Jackson’s words, we deny Defendants’ motion for a stay. \n   75     \n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 76 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 76 of 105\nFILED\nSierra Club v.

DWYER, CLERK\nU.S. COURT OF APPEALS\nThe majority here takes an uncharted and risky approach—turning every\nquestion of whether an executive officer exceeded a statutory grant of power into a\nconstitutional issue. This approach is in contradiction to the most fundamental\nconcepts of judicial review. The majority has created a constitutional issue where\nnone previously existed. See Dalton v. Specter, 511 U.S. 462, 472–74 (1994). We\nhave no right to expand the Judiciary’s role in this manner and, as explained in\ngreater detail below, the majority’s approach has been expressly rejected by the\nSupreme Court.\nTurning to the merits of the case before us, we are asked solely whether we\nshould stay a permanent injunction prohibiting Defendants from transferring\ncertain funds within the budget of the Department of Defense (DoD) to support\ncounterdrug activities, while the parties await a final ruling on the merits of the\npermanent injunction order.

Id. at 435. Although\n“[t]he first two factors . . . are the most critical,” id. at 434, we must “give serious\nconsideration to the public interest factor,” Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. v. Winter,\n1The majority ignores this declaration. Maj. Op. at 31. The parties have\nasked us to expedite our decision, but they have not asked us to make a merits\ndecision in contravention of traditional procedure. Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418,\n427 (2009) (recognizing that the “ordinary processes of administration and judicial\nreview” best ensure “careful review and a meaningful decision” (citation omitted)).\nWhether an issue may become moot during the course of an appeal does not\nchange the scope of our review for a motion to stay. Even though the parties rely\non their previous briefs for purposes of this motion, they do not suggest that they\ndo not have additional arguments for the merits of appeal. We should not be\ndeciding the merits of these issues (potentially binding the merits panel).\n2\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 78 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 78 of 105\n502 F.3d 859, 863 (9th Cir. 2007). In any event, the decision to grant or deny a\nstay is discretionary. Nken, 556 U.S. at 433–34. Here, each factor favors issuing a\nstay.2\nI.  Defendants are Likely to Succeed on the Merits\nThe district court granted a permanent injunction in Plaintiffs’ favor based\non a purported statutory claim under the DoD Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year\n2019, Pub. L. No. 115-245, §§ 8005, 9002, 132 Stat. 2981, 2999. See Permanent\nInjunction Order at 3–4, 6–8. The district court analyzed only whether Defendants\nexceeded their statutory authority under § 8005, without discussing whether they\nalso separately violated any constitutional provision. See generally id.\n2Whether Defendants are likely to succeed on the merits of this appeal\nultimately turns on whether the district court abused its discretion in issuing the\npermanent injunction. See La Quinta Worldwide LLC v. Q.R.T.M., S.A. de C.V.,\n762 F.3d 867, 879 (9th Cir. 2014). Thus, even though this is only a motion to stay,\nwe review the district court’s grant of a permanent injunction for abuse of\ndiscretion, and we review its legal conclusions de novo. Aircraft Serv. Int’l, Inc. v.\nInt’l Bhd. of Teamsters, 779 F.3d 1069, 1072 (9th Cir. 2015) (en banc). “It is an\nabuse of discretion to apply the wrong legal standard.” United States v. Emmett,\n749 F.3d 817, 819 (9th Cir. 2014). As explained in greater detail below, the district\ncourt abused its discretion here by failing to analyze Plaintiffs’ claim under the\nAdministrative Procedure Act. See, e.g., Permanent Injunction Order at 4 (“[T]he\nCourt continues to find that the [zone of interests] test has no application in an\nultra vires challenge, which operates outside of the APA framework.”). The\nmajority does not defend the district court’s decision, but rules in Plaintiffs’ favor\nunder a completely different—yet equally faulty—legal theory. \n3\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 79 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 79 of 105\nNevertheless, the majority views Plaintiffs’ claim as, “at its core, one alleging a\nconstitutional violation.” Maj. Op. at 32. As discussed below, viewing Plaintiffs’\nclaim as alleging a statutory violation is the proper approach. Dalton, 511 U.S. at\n472–74.\nWhen their claim is properly viewed as alleging a statutory violation,\nPlaintiffs have no mechanism to challenge Defendants’ actions. Plaintiffs have\nneither an implied statutory cause of action under § 8005, nor an equitable cause of\naction. See generally Dalton, 511 U.S. at 472–76. Nor do Plaintiffs have a cause of\naction to challenge the DoD’s § 8005 reprogramming under the Administrative\nProcedure Act (APA), as they fall outside of the zone of interests for such a claim.\nConsequently, Defendants have made a strong showing that they are likely to\nsucceed on the merits of their appeal.\n1. Plaintiffs Claim Is Properly Viewed as Alleging a Statutory Violation\nBecause we are allowed to affirm the permanent injunction “on any ground\nsupported by the record,” Sony Comput. Entm’t, Inc. v. Connectix Corp., 203 F.3d\n596, 608 (9th Cir. 2000) (citation omitted), the majority denies Defendants’ motion\nfor a stay by re-characterizing Plaintiffs’ claim as a constitutional\nviolation—despite the contrary ground relied on by the district court in its\n4\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 80 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 80 of 105\ndecision3—which the majority now analyzes on the fly.\nThe majority’s primary mistake is drawing no distinction between a claim\nthat an agency is violating a statute and a claim that an agency is violating the\nConstitution:\nIf  section  8005  does  not  authorize  the  reallocation,  however,  then\nDefendants are acting outside of any statutory appropriation and are\ntherefore  spending  funds  contrary  to  Congress’s  appropriations\ndecisions. . . . The lack of compliance with section 8005 has sometimes\nbeen labeled ultra vires as outside statutory authority or as outside the\nPresident’s Article II powers, and spending without an appropriation has\nbeen described as a violation of the Appropriations Clause. However\ntheir claim is labeled, Plaintiffs’ theory is ultimately the same.  \nMaj. Op. at 34 & n.16. This approach is flatly contradicted by Dalton and related\ncases, which clarified the distinction between “claims of constitutional violations\nand claims that an official has acted in excess of his statutory authority” and\ndeclared that “[o]ur cases do not support the proposition that every action by the\nPresident, or by another executive official, in excess of his statutory authority is\n3The district court construed Plaintiffs’ claim as an ultra vires action to\nenforce § 8005. Permanent Injunction Order at 4. It determined that principles of\nconstitutional avoidance required it to first analyze whether § 8005 supported the\nreprogramming, and reach the constitutional analysis only if necessary. Sierra\nClub v. Trump, No. 19-CV-00892-HSG, 2019 WL 2247689, *18 (N.D. Cal. March\n24, 2019); Permanent Injunction Order at 5 (“[N]o new factual or legal arguments\npersuade the Court that its analysis in the preliminary injunction order was\nwrong.”). Thus, the court never conducted a constitutional analysis of this\nquestion. \n5\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 81 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 81 of 105\nipso facto in violation of the Constitution.” Dalton, 511 U.S. at 472.\nIndeed, recasting Plaintiffs’ challenge—fundamentally a dispute about\nwhether the DoD erred in deciding that the pre-conditions of § 8005 were met—as\na constitutional claim against the DoD for violating the Appropriations Clause\ncontradicts several lines of caselaw. \nFirst, Dalton clarifies that cases such as Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v.\nSawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952) involve constitutional violations, because “[t]he only\nbasis of authority asserted was the [executive’s] inherent constitutional power.”\nDalton, 511 U.S. at 473. In those instances, “the case necessarily turned on\nwhether the Constitution authorized the [executive’s] actions,” only “[b]ecause no\nstatutory authority was claimed.” Id. (emphasis added). \nThis is not that type of case. As noted by the majority, Plaintiffs’ claim\nentirely rises or falls on whether the DoD complied with the limitations in § 8005.\nMaj. Op. at 34 (“If Defendants were correct that section 8005 allowed this\nspending reallocation, Plaintiffs’ claim would fail, because the spending would be\nconsistent with Congress’s appropriation legislation. If section 8005 does not\nauthorize the reallocation, however, then Defendants are acting outside of any\nstatutory appropriation and are therefore spending funds contrary to Congress’s\nappropriations decisions.”). The DoD offers no other source of authority besides a\n6\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 82 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 82 of 105\nstatute. Accordingly, this case “concern[s] only issues of statutory interpretation”\nand “no constitutional question whatever is raised.” Dalton, 511 U.S. at 474 n.6\n(emphasis added) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \nSecond, applying Dalton to the Appropriations Clause context requires us to\nreject the majority’s logic, which relies on the assumption that every violation of\nan appropriations statute is necessarily a constitutional violation. In Dalton,\nCongress granted the President discretion to take certain actions, and the plaintiffs\nasserted that he had exceeded that authority. Id. at 474. The plaintiffs further\nclaimed that, because the President had exceeded his statutory authority, he had\nalso violated the Constitution. Id. That is precisely the majority’s approach in this\ncase. See Maj. Op. at 51 (“Plaintiffs claim that to the extent Defendants did not\nhave statutory authority to reprogram the funds, they acted in violation of\nconstitutional separation of powers principles because Defendants lack any\nbackground constitutional authority to appropriate funds.”). The Supreme Court\nrejected this type of constitutional claim, flatly reminding us that “[t]he distinction\nbetween claims that an official exceeded his statutory authority, on the one hand,\nand claims that he acted in violation of the Constitution, on the other, is too well\nestablished to permit this sort of evisceration.” Dalton, 511 U.S. at 474.  \nFinally, the distinction between an Appropriations Clause violation and a\n7\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 83 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 83 of 105\nnon-constitutional “exceeding statutory authority” claim turns on the degree of\ndiscretion Congress has provided to the agency or President in appropriating funds.\nOn the one hand, if Congress has entirely withdrawn agency discretion over the\nwho, what, when, where, and why of agency spending, an Appropriations Clause\nviolation may lie. See, e.g., United States v. McIntosh, 833 F.3d 1163, 1172, 1175\n(9th Cir. 2016). On the other hand, if Congress has merely appropriated a lump-\nsum amount and leaves it to the agency to re-allocate funds toward a particular\nstatutory purpose, Congress has provided such discretion to the agency that, not\nonly could there be no constitutional violation, a challenger does not even have a\nviable “exceeding statutory authority” claim.4 See Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182,\n193 (1993). Section 8005, which appropriates funds to the DoD and makes\nallocating those funds incumbent on the Secretary’s determination of the “national\ninterest” and other factors, falls somewhere in the middle. Unlike the\nappropriations language in McIntosh, which we observed “specifically restricts [the\nDepartment of Justice (DOJ)] from spending money to pursue certain activities,”\n833 F.3d at 1172 (emphasis added), or the non-discretionary “not to exceed” and\n“shall be allotted” language in Train v. City of New York, 420 U.S. 35, 42 (1975),\n4The statutory claims in Dalton ultimately failed on this basis. See Dalton,\n511 U.S. at 474–76.\n8\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 84 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 84 of 105\n§ 8005 provides some discretion over the who, what, when, where, and why of\nagency spending. Yet, unlike the virtually unfettered discretion of the agency to re-\nallocate funds towards particular statutory purposes in Lincoln, 508 U.S. at\n192–93, § 8005 constrains the discretion and the DoD is “not free simply to\ndisregard statutory responsibilities.” Id. at 193 (emphasis added). Accordingly, the\nDoD’s reprogramming of funds is a judicially reviewable statutory claim. The\nmajority overlooks these points.\nIn attempting to distinguish Dalton, the majority misstates the chronology of\nthe Supreme Court’s decision, claiming that “[t]he Supreme Court held that the\nplaintiff’s statutory challenge to the President’s decision failed because the statute\ngave the President unfettered discretion . . . [and] then also rejected the argument\nthat because the President had allegedly violated the statute, he had acted\nunconstitutionally.” Maj. Op. at 49. However, the Supreme Court declared first that\nthere was no constitutional issue, Dalton, 511 U.S. at 472–74, and only thereafter\ndetermined that the plaintiffs’ statutory claim failed based on the President’s\nunfettered discretion, id. at 474–76. Consequently, the Court’s conclusion that “no\nconstitutional question whatever is raised” did not stem from its later conclusion\nthat the President had, in fact, acted within his statutory authority in that case. Id. at\n474 n.6; see also id. at 476–77 (“In sum . . . [t]he claim that the President exceeded\n9\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 85 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 85 of 105\nhis authority under the 1990 Act is not a constitutional claim, but a statutory one.\nWhere a statute, such as the 1990 Act, commits decisionmaking to the discretion of\nthe President, judicial review of the President’s decision is not available.”\n(emphasis added)).\nThe majority also attempts to distinguish Dalton on the grounds that it “did\nnot say . . . that action in excess of statutory authority can never violate the\nConstitution or give rise to a constitutional claim.” Maj. Op. at 49. Albeit true that\nclaims alleging statutory violations and those alleging constitutional violations are\nnot mutually exclusive, Dalton expressly discussed when the two may be asserted\ntogether—by pointing to cases where the constitutionality of the authorizing statute\nitself is called into question. Dalton, 511 U.S. at 473 n.5; see, e.g., Chamber of\nCommerce of United States v. Reich, 74 F.3d 1322, 1325 (D.C. Cir. 1996)\n(determining that a claim raised a constitutional violation, because it alleged that\nthe relevant statutory authority itself was “an unconstitutional delegation” of\nCongressional power). But Plaintiffs have not alleged that § 8005 is itself\nunconstitutional.\nThe majority’s approach would turn our current system of administrative\nreview on its head, directing courts in this circuit to deem unconstitutional any\nreviewable executive actions (i.e., any actions that are not entirely within the\n10\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 86 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 86 of 105\nactor’s discretion) that exceed a statutory grant of authority. Such an approach\ndirectly contradicts the Supreme Court’s declaration that “[o]ur cases do not\nsupport the proposition that every action by the President, or by another executive\nofficial, in excess of his statutory authority is ipso facto in violation of the\nConstitution.”5 Dalton, 511 U.S. at 472. For those reasons, the majority’s approach\nis flawed; no claim of a constitutional violation exists in this case.\n2. Plaintiffs have no Implied Statutory Claim\nWhether Plaintiffs have an implied statutory cause of action under § 8005\nturns on “whether Congress intended to create a private cause of action.”\nKarahalios v. Nat’l Fed’n of Fed. Emps., Local 1263, 489 U.S. 527, 532 (1989)\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\nHere, “[t]here is no express suggestion” that Congress intended a direct\njudicial remedy for a § 8005 violation, and “neither the language nor the structure\nof the Act shows any congressional intent to provide a private cause of action to”\njudicially enforce such a violation. Id. at 532–33. Likewise, “[n]othing in the\n5The majority’s approach is also directly contradicted by the D.C. Circuit. In\nMountain States Legal Foundation v. Bush, our sister circuit determined that “[n]o\nconstitutional . . . claim is before us, as the President exercised his delegated\npowers under the Antiquities Act,” precisely because “that statute includes\nintelligible principles to guide the President’s actions.” 306 F.3d 1132, 1137 (D.C.\nCir. 2002) (emphasis added). \n11\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 87 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 87 of 105\nlegislative history of [§ 8005] has been called to our attention indicating that\nCongress contemplated direct judicial enforcement.” Id. at 533. \nFurthermore, § 8005 is directed not at private parties or individuals, but at\nthe Secretary of Defense; creates no apparent individual rights, much less an\nindividual remedy; and “lacks the sort of rights-creating language needed to imply\na private right of action.” Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 135 S. Ct.\n1378, 1387 (2015).\n3. Plaintiffs have no APA Claim\nWith Dalton limiting our ability to construe Plaintiffs’ claim as alleging a\nconstitutional violation, and with no implied statutory cause of action to challenge\nthe agency’s action as a violation of § 8005, Plaintiffs are left with challenging the\nDoD’s reprogramming under the APA as an “abuse of discretion,” “not in\naccordance with law,” or “in excess of statutory jurisdiction.” See 5 U.S.C.\n§ 706(2)(A), (C). See Clouser v. Espy, 42 F.3d 1522, 1527 n.5 (9th Cir. 1994)\n(construing a plaintiff’s challenge to Forest Service rulings “as issued without\nstatutory authority” to be “a claim challenging agency action ‘in excess of statutory\njurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right’ under 5 U.S.C.\n§ 706(2)(C)”). However, although the APA is the proper vehicle for challenging\nthe DoD’s § 8005 reprogramming, Plaintiffs are not a proper party to bring such a\n12\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 88 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 88 of 105\nclaim, as they fall outside § 8005’s zone of interests. The majority errs by\nfashioning an equitable claim to bypass the APA’s limitations.\na. The APA is the Proper Vehicle for Challenging the DoD’s \nAction\nWhere a statute imposes obligations on a federal agency but “does not give\nrise to a ‘private’ right of action against the federal government[,] [a]n aggrieved\nparty may pursue its remedy under the APA.” San Carlos Apache Tribe v. United\nStates, 417 F.3d 1091, 1096–99 (9th Cir. 2005) (explaining how a federal action is\nnearly always reviewable under the APA for conformity with statutory obligations\neven absent a “private right of action”). In other words, the APA opens the door for\njudicial review provided: (1) the agency’s action is “final,” 5 U.S.C. § 704; (2) the\nstatute imposing obligations on the federal agency does not “preclude judicial\nreview,” id. § 701(a)(1); and (3) the agency action is not “committed to agency\ndiscretion by law,” id. § 701(a)(2). See Weyerhaeuser Co. v. U.S. Fish & Wildlife\nServ., 139 S. Ct. 361, 370 (2018). Each element is satisfied here.\nFirst, the agency’s action satisfies the test for “final agency action” for\npurposes of 5 U.S.C. § 704. The finality of an agency’s action turns on whether the\ndecision represents the “consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process”\nand whether it determines rights or obligations, or from which “legal consequences\nwill flow.” Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177–78 (1997) (citation omitted). After\n13\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 89 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 89 of 105\napproving the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) request for support\nunder 10 U.S.C. § 284, the Secretary of Defense concluded support could be\nfunded through the reprogramming of funds under § 8005. The Secretary found the\n§ 8005 criteria were met. Following the necessary procedures, the DoD transferred\nthe funds to the Drug Interdiction and Counter-Drug Activities, Defense,\nappropriation account. Because the DoD committed those funds for § 284(b)(7)\nsupport, “legal consequences [began to] flow.” See Bennett, 520 U.S. at 178\n(citation omitted). Indeed, Defendants acknowledge that the § 8005 transfer was\nnecessary for authorizing support under § 284 and constructing the wall.\nSecond, as explained above, § 8005 does not “preclude judicial review.” See\n5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(1). Further, neither party presented “clear and convincing\nevidence” that § 8005 precludes APA’s default remedy. See Abbott Labs. v.\nGardner, 387 U.S. 136, 140–41 (1967), abrogated on other grounds by Califano v.\nSanders, 430 U.S. 99 (1977).\nFinally, the DoD’s reprogramming of funds under § 8005 is not “committed\nto agency discretion by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2). Defendants do not argue to the\ncontrary, nor would such an argument succeed. The APA embodies a broad\npresumption of judicial review of agency action.

(quoting Lincoln, 508 U.S. at 191).\nThe appropriation scheme governing § 8005 allows the DoD to reprogram\nfunds provided the transferred funds address “higher priority items, based on\nunforeseen military requirements, than those for which originally appropriated.”6\n§ 8005. And “in no case” may the Secretary use the funds “where the item for\nwhich reprogramming is requested has been denied by the Congress.” Id. Thus, we\ndo not confront one of those rare circumstances where a court would have no\nmeaningful standard for judging the agency’s exercise of discretion. See\nWeyerhaeuser, 139 S.

See Alaska Dep’t of Envtl. Conservation v.\nEPA, 540 U.S. 461, 487 (2004). Skidmore deference operates like a sliding scale,\nmeaning the degree of deference we give the agency’s interpretation of a statute\n“depend[s] upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its\nreasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those\nfactors which give it power to persuade, if lacking power to control.” Skidmore,\n323 U.S. at 140. We also consider whether the agency has changed its position or\nwhether its interpretation “was framed for the specific purpose of aiding a party in\nthis litigation.” Fed. Express Corp. v. Holowecki, 552 U.S. 389, 400 (2008).\n9Because the majority concludes Plaintiffs’ APA claim is constitutional, we\n(continued...)\n16\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 92 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 92 of 105\nThe zone of interests test requires a court to determine whether, “in view of\nCongress’ evident intent to make agency action presumptively reviewable, a\nparticular plaintiff should be heard to complain of a particular agency decision.”\nClarke v. Sec. Indus. Ass’n, 479 U.S. 388, 399 (1987). “[T]he relevant zone of\ninterests is not that of the APA itself, but rather the zone of interests to be protected\nor regulated by the statute that the plaintiff says was violated.” E. Bay Sanctuary\nCovenant v. Trump, 909 F.3d 1219, 1244 (9th Cir. 2018) (alteration omitted)\n(quoting Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak,\n567 U.S. 209, 224 (2012)). “[W]e first discern the interests arguably to be\nprotected by the statutory provision at issue; we then inquire whether the plaintiff’s\ninterests affected by the agency action in question are among them.” Nat’l Credit\nUnion Admin. v. First Nat’l Bank & Tr. Co., 522 U.S. 479, 492 (1998) (alteration\nand internal quotation marks omitted). \nAlthough, “in the APA context, . . . the test is not ‘especially demanding,’”\nLexmark, 572 U.S. at 130, it “is not toothless,” Nw. Requirements Utils. v. FERC,\n9(...continued)\ndisagree as to what zone of interests applies. However, as a statutory claim,\nPlaintiffs must fall within the zone of interests of § 8005. They have failed to do\nso. Because this claim should not be viewed as a constitutional claim under the\nAppropriations Clause, it is not necessary to decide whether Plaintiffs could (or\nwould need to) fall within that zone of interests. \n17\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 93 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 93 of 105\n798 F.3d 796, 808 (9th Cir. 2015). “In cases where the plaintiff is not itself the\nsubject of the contested regulatory action, the test denies a right of review if the\nplaintiff’s interests are so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes\nimplicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress intended\nto permit the suit.” Clarke, 479 U.S. at 399. Even under this generous standard, we\nhave found certain APA claims fail the zone of interests test.10 See, e.g., Ashley\nCreek Phosphate Co. v. Norton, 420 F.3d 934, 940 (9th Cir. 2005) (“[P]urely\neconomic interests do not fall within [the National Environmental Policy Act’s\n(NEPA)] zone of interests” because “the zone of interests that NEPA protects [is]\nenvironmental.”); Havasupai Tribe v. Provencio, 906 F.3d 1155, 1166–67 (9th Cir.\n2018) (recognizing that the plaintiff’s environmental interests fell outside the\nMining Act’s zone of interests, but within the Federal Land Policy and\nManagement Act’s zone of interests); Nw. Requirements Utils., 798 F.3d at 809\n(determining zone of interests test not satisfied where the plaintiffs’ goals were\nlikely to frustrate rather than further statutory objectives).\n10Plaintiffs cite the D.C. Circuit’s decision in Scheduled Airlines Traffic\nOffices, Inc. v. Department of Defense, 87 F.3d 1356 (D.C. Cir. 1996) as\n“illustrat[ing] the expansive zone of interests for claims arising under statutes\nprotecting Congress’s control over appropriations decisions.” However, that case\nmerely applied the same zone of interests test that we do here to determine that the\nplaintiff’s economic interests were “sufficiently congruent” with the statute and fell\nwithin the zone of interests. Id. at 1360.\n18\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 94 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 94 of 105\nHere, Plaintiffs’ interests fall outside § 8005’s zone of interests. Section\n8005 operates only to authorize the Secretary of Defense to transfer previously-\nappropriated funds between DoD accounts, based upon certain conditions and\ncircumstances. This statute arguably protects Congress and those who would have\nbeen entitled to the funds as originally appropriated; and as a budgetary statute\nregarding the transfer of funds among DoD accounts, it arguably protects economic\ninterests. Plaintiffs have not asserted that they would have been entitled to the\nfunds but for the transfer, nor have they raised any other economic interests.\nRather, they assert aesthetic, recreational, and generalized environmental interests\nthat will be affected, not by the transfer of funds, but by the building of the border\nwall. Nothing in § 8005 requires that aesthetic, recreational, or environmental\ninterests be considered before a transfer is made, nor does the statute even address\nsuch interests. At best, Plaintiffs’ interests are only “marginally related to . . . the\npurposes implicit in the statute [such] that it cannot reasonably be assumed that\nCongress intended to permit the suit,” Clarke, 479 U.S. at 399, and they fall\noutside § 8005’s zone of interests. Thus, Plaintiffs may not bring this APA claim,\nbecause their interests are not protected by the relevant statute.\nc. The Existence of an APA Claim Also Precludes an Equitable \nConstitutional Claim\nEven though these Plaintiffs lack a cause of action under the APA, this court\n19\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 95 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 95 of 105\ncannot save their claim by fashioning an “equitable” work-around to assert a\nconstitutional claim, as the majority has done. Even if we ignored the discretion\n§ 8005 provides to the DoD and thus could reframe Plaintiffs’ claim as a\nconstitutional one, the APA’s “scope of review” provision would cover it. Those\nprovisions provide that a reviewing court shall:\n[H]old unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions\nfound to be—\n(A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not\nin accordance with law;\n(B) contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity;\n(C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or\nshort of statutory right[.]\n5 U.S.C. § 706(2) (emphasis added). Where courts can review an agency action\nunder the APA to ensure the agency has not abused its discretion, violated the\nConstitution, or otherwise operated outside its authority, we have no business\ndevising additional “equitable” causes of action. Here, an avenue for challenging\nthe DoD’s reprogramming action exists under the APA—just not for these\nPlaintiffs. Thus, there is no reason to resort to the extraordinary step of implying an\nequitable cause of action for these Plaintiffs. \nAs the majority recognizes, “[t]he ability to sue to enjoin unconstitutional\nactions by state and federal officers is the creation of courts of equity.” See \nArmstrong, 135 S. Ct. at 1384–85. However, this “judge-made remedy” does not\n20\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 96 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 96 of 105\nprovide courts the unfettered power to enjoin executive action; our power “is\nsubject to express and implied statutory limitations.” Id. at 1385. The majority\nignores this limitation, relying on inapposite cases to conclude that a federal\ncourt’s “equity” jurisdiction allows any would-be plaintiff to avoid proceeding\nunder the APA. Maj. Op. at 46–47. That the Supreme Court considered challenges\nto a president’s action in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579\n(1952) and Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392 (2018) lends the majority no support;\nthe APA does not apply to the President, see Dalton, 511 U.S. at 468, so no\nplaintiff would have an APA claim in those cases. Yet this case is about an agency\naction, and therefore the APA applies. Moreover, McIntosh arose in a very\ndifferent context; our court did not “allow[] an equitable action to enforce the\nAppropriations Clause,” Maj. Op. at 48, we considered the Appropriations Clause\nas a defense for criminal defendants indicted for federal marijuana offenses,\nMcIntosh, 833 F.3d at 1168 (“We are asked to decide whether criminal defendants\nmay avoid prosecution for various federal marijuana offenses on the basis of a\ncongressional appropriations rider that prohibits the United States Department of\nJustice from spending funds to prevent states’ implementation of their own medical\nmarijuana laws.”). Allowing defendants to invoke constitutional principles as a\ndefense is common, see, e.g., Bond v. United States, 564 U.S. 211, 225–26 (2011),\n21\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 97 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 97 of 105\nand distinguishable from the affirmative enforcement that the majority provides\nhere.11    \nThe majority’s reliance on Armstrong highlights its fundamental\nmisunderstanding of cases involving a court’s equitable power to enjoin acts\nviolating federal law. Maj. Op. at 52–53. Congress has not displaced the possibility\nof judge-made equitable remedies against federal agencies through the APA, see\nArmstrong, 135 S. Ct. at 1385, it codified judicial review of agency action.12 Cf. W.\nRadio Servs. Co. v. U.S. Forest Serv., 578 F.3d 1116, 1123 (9th Cir. 2009) (“The\nfact that APA’s procedures are available where no other adequate alternative\nremedy exists further indicates Congress’s intent that courts should not devise\n11The majority misunderstands my point about the distinguishing features of\nMcIntosh. Maj. Op. at 48. The question facing the McIntosh court was whether\ncriminal defendants could halt their prosecutions by attacking how the DOJ was\nfunding the prosecutions. 833 F.3d at 1172–73. All of the defendants “filed\nmotions to dismiss or to enjoin on the basis of the rider.” Id. at 1170. In granting\nrelief, the court stated that it “need not decide in the first instance exactly how the\ndistrict courts should resolve claims that the DOJ is spending money to prosecute a\ndefendant in violation of an appropriations rider. We therefore take no view on the\nprecise relief required and leave that issue to the district courts in the first\ninstance.” Id. at 1172 n.2. As such, McIntosh simply did not address or\ncontemplate an injunction to enjoin spending funds parallel to the pending criminal\nproceedings.\n12Without supporting authority, the majority even suggests that the\navailability of an equitable cause of action would preclude an APA claim under the\nAPA provision providing for judicial review when “there is no other adequate\nremedy in a court.” Maj. Op. at 57 (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 704).   \n22\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 98 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 98 of 105\nadditional, judicially crafted default remedies.”); San Carlos Apache Tribe, 417\nF.3d at 1096–97 (“[C]reating a direct private action against the federal government\nmakes little sense in light of the administrative review scheme set out in the\nAPA.”).13 \nThe majority’s failure to channel Plaintiffs’ claims through the APA’s\nframework for challenging agency action will inevitably lead to peculiar results.\nWhat prevents future plaintiffs from simply challenging any agency action\n“equitably,” thereby avoiding the APA’s limited judicial review under the\n“arbitrary and capricious” standard, so that a court may substitute its own judgment\nfor that of the agency? See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n. of\nUnited States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983). The\nmajority offers no reason to distort decades of administrative law practice to\nrecognize Plaintiffs’ “equitable” action when the APA provides for review of the\n13The majority’s reliance on Navajo Nation v. Department of the Interior,\n876 F.3d 1144 (9th Cir. 2017) and Presbyterian Church v. United States, 870 F.2d\n518 (9th Cir. 1989) is misplaced. Presbyterian Church reserved the determination\nof whether there was “agency action” within the meaning of the APA, 870 F.2d at\n525 n.8, meaning there was no “alternative” APA claim. Navajo Nation addressed\nthe limits of the APA’s waiver of sovereign immunity, but offered no guidance\nabout the propriety of bringing parallel claims espousing the same theory under\ntwo different causes of action (under the APA and “equitably”). 876 F.3d at\n1171–72. Thus, neither case stands for the proposition that, where (as here) an\nagency action is reviewable under the APA, Plaintiffs may bring a parallel\n“equitable” claim.\n23\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 99 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 99 of 105\nDoD’s reprogramming actions.\nAlthough it may seem unjust that Plaintiffs have no viable recourse for their\nasserted injuries, “[t]he judicial power of the United States conferred by Article III\nof the Constitution is upheld just as surely by withholding judicial relief where\nCongress has permissibly foreclosed it, as it is by granting such relief where\nauthorized by the Constitution or by statute.” Dalton, 511 U.S. at 477. Plaintiffs’\nrelief has been permissibly foreclosed here, and Defendants have accordingly\ndemonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the merits of their appeal.\nII.  The Other Relevant Factors Also Favor a Stay\nTo reemphasize, the issue before us is a motion to stay the district court’s\ninjunction under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 8. We are limited to decide\nonly whether a stay should be granted until the appeal on the merits is final.\nAlthough “[a] stay is not a matter of right, even if irreparable injury might\notherwise result,” it is “an exercise of judicial discretion, and the propriety of its\nissue is dependent upon the circumstances of the particular case.” Nken, 556 U.S.\nat 433 (citations, alteration, and quotation marks omitted). Here, the circumstances\nof this case merit our discretionary relief pending appeal. \nEven if Defendants had failed to show a strong likelihood of success on the\nmerits, they “may be entitled to prevail if [they] can demonstrate a ‘substantial case\n24\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 100 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 100 of 105\non the merits’ and the second and fourth factors [irreparable injury and public\ninterest] militate in [their] favor.” Winter, 502 F.3d at 863. Because Plaintiffs have\nno viable claim for relief, Defendants have more than demonstrated a substantial\ncase on the merits.14 Therefore, our panel must “give serious consideration” to the\nsecond and fourth factors. Id.\nAs to irreparable harm, Defendants argue that without a stay they will be\nprevented from ever using the enjoined funds to complete the identified projects\naddressed by the permanent injunction. Defendants are likely correct. The funding\nfor those projects will lapse on September 30th, and even if Defendants prevail in\nthis court’s final ruling, we could not order or permit Defendants to spend funds\ngranted in a lapsed appropriation. See, e.g., City of Houston v. Dep’t of Hous. &\nUrban Dev., 24 F.3d 1421, 1424, 1426–27 (D.C. Cir. 1994). No one appears to\ndispute that this will likely be the practical consequence if a stay is denied.\n14As to the discretionary standard of review, the district court did not apply\nthe second and fourth factors (for the short period of time for which this appeal\nwould be pending) to the request for the permanent injunction. Thus, its factual\nfindings are not clear as to the motion before us. It did have the occasion to apply\nthese two factors in its analysis of the stay of the preliminary injunction. However,\nin its analysis of that stay, it chose to ignore these factors, concluding that,\n“[b]ecause the Court finds that Defendants have not met their burden to make a\nstrong showing that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their appeal, the\nCourt need not further address the other Nken factors.” Sierra Club v. Trump, No.\n19-CV-00892-HSG, 2019 WL 2305341, at *2 n.2 (N.D. Cal. May 30, 2019). This\nconclusion was an abuse of discretion. See Winter, 502 F.3d at 862.\n25\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 101 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 101 of 105\nCongress may opt to appropriate new funds for these projects in the future, but that\npossibility is irrelevant. Simply, the permanent injunction will certainly render\nDefendants unable to use the funds at issue here under § 284(b)(7). Thus, there is a\n“possibility that . . . corrective relief will [not] be available at a later date, in the\nordinary course of litigation.” See Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 90 (1974).\nTherefore, Defendants have demonstrated that they will be irreparably injured if a\nstay is not issued. See id. \nAs to the public interest, Defendants argue that their interests in preventing\ndrug trafficking easily outweigh Plaintiffs’ aesthetic, recreational, and generalized\nenvironmental injuries. In the narrow context of this stay motion, Defendants are\ncorrect. Even though environmental injuries may be significant in the long term,\nthe injunction will only be stayed for a short period.15 If the DoD is precluded from\nobligating these funds in the 2019 fiscal year, it must forgo providing support\nunder § 284(b)(7). Defendants have adequately demonstrated that the public\ninterest weighs in their favor for supporting § 284(b)(7) for at least three reasons.16  \n15As previously noted, the parties have suggested that an expedited briefing\nschedule will be requested. Given the need for a timely resolution of this case, this\ncase should be resolved shortly.\n16Whether the district court appropriately balanced these interests when it\nissued the permanent injunction is not before us. Our inquiry is limited to the\nmotion to stay, and the final determination on the balance on interests is one that\n(continued...)\n26\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 102 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 102 of 105\nFirst, no one disputes that Defendants have broad authority to carry out a\nvariety of actions aimed at disrupting the cross-border flow of narcotics in the\naffected areas. Cf. United States v. Guzman-Padilla, 573 F.3d 865, 889 (9th Cir.\n2009). Nor does anyone dispute that Defendants are authorized by statute to\nconstruct fencing and other barriers for that purpose in the areas at issue in this\nlawsuit. See 10 U.S.C. § 284(b)(7). Nor even does anyone seriously dispute the\nDoD’s determination that drug trafficking along our southern border (including in\nthe project areas at issue here) threatens the safety and security of our nation and\nits citizens. See Winter, 502 F.3d at 862 (“We customarily give considerable\ndeference to the Executive Branch’s judgment regarding foreign policy and\nnational defense.” (citing Dep’t of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 529 (1988))); see\nalso Franklin, 505 U.S. at 818. Given this significant national security interest, the\npublic would benefit more from a stay that—while this appeal is pending—permits\nDefendants to effect the policies that it has determined are necessary to minimize\nthat threat, than it would from a decision that hampers Defendants’ ability to\ncombat this threat throughout the present appellate process.17\n16(...continued)\nthe merits panel will ultimately decide.\n17The record does not reflect that Congress “denied” funding under § 284.\nThe funds at issue here will be used solely to “provide support for the counterdrug\n(continued...)\n27\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 103 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 103 of 105\nSecond, if the injunction is allowed to remain in effect, it will, for reasons\noutlined above, potentially cause irreparable harm to Defendants. On the other\nhand, the irreparable harm to Plaintiffs during this relatively short period (if a stay\nis granted) is less clear. Defendants have represented to this court that the projects\nat issue are needed to protect national security and must go forward even if there is\na possibility that a merits panel may eventually order them to remove whatever\nwas constructed while a stay was in place. This is not the sort of determination that\ncourts will ordinarily second guess. See Winter, 502 F.3d at 862; Franklin, 505\nU.S. at 818 (recognizing “the principle of judicial deference that pervades the area\nof national security”); see also Munaf v. Geren, 553 U.S. 674, 689 (2008) (“We\ntherefore approach these questions cognizant that ‘courts traditionally have been\n17(...continued)\nactivities.” § 284. The fact that there were numerous discussions surrounding the\nbuilding of a wall, during the budgetary negotiations and the shut down of the\ngovernment, does not alter what Congress set forth in its appropriations bill for the\nDoD. See Salazar v. Ramah Navajo Chapter, 567 U.S. 182, 200 (2012) (“An\nagency’s discretion to spend appropriated funds is cabined only by the ‘text of the\nappropriation,’ not by Congress’ expectations of how the funds will be spent, as\nmight be reflected by legislative history.” (citation omitted)). Nowhere in the DoD\nAppropriations Act are there limitations on its ability to act under § 284. Moreover,\nthe transfer of funds stays within the DoD’s allotted appropriations and does not\nincrease the appropriations of the DHS. Even if we should look to all appropriation\nacts, the only limitations placed on the DHS “for the construction of pedestrian\nfencing” were for geographic areas and “funds made available by this Act or prior\nActs.” See Pub. L. No. 116-6, § 231, 133 Stat. 13, 28. see also id. § 232.\n28\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 104 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 104 of 105\nreluctant to intrude upon the authority of the Executive in military and national\nsecurity affairs.’” (quoting Egan, 484 U.S. at 530)). It is difficult to determine that\nPlaintiffs’ inability to recreate in and otherwise enjoy this public land would\noutweigh the claimed national interests during the limited period of time the\nrequested stay would be in place—especially considering Plaintiffs do not have a\nviable cause of action to challenge Defendants’ actions under § 8005.\nThird, the district court’s reasoning that the public interest does not favor\nDefendants, because the public has a generalized interest in ensuring that the\nExecutive acts within the limits imposed by statute and by the Constitution, simply\nbegs the question. If a court accepts the premise that Defendants exceeded\nstatutory or constitutional limitations on its authority, then the public has an\ninterest in seeing that the Executive Branch is “reined in.” However, if Defendants\nshow that they did not exceed those bounds, then the public interest articulated by\nPlaintiffs and the district court has no merit. Moreover, when considering whether\nto grant a stay, the public interest factor cannot rise or fall on how the appeal is\nultimately resolved on its merits. That analysis would collapse the public interest\nfactor into the first element of the four-part test. \nIn conclusion, because Defendants have more than demonstrated a\nsubstantial case on the merits, and because the second and fourth factors “militate\n29\n\nCase: 19-16102, 07/03/2019, ID: 11354254, DktEntry: 76, Page 105 of 105\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 192   Filed 07/03/19   Page 105 of 105\nin [their] favor,” we should exercise our discretion and issue a stay pending the\nappeal of the district court’s permanent injunction. See Winter, 502 F.3d at 863. It\nmakes little sense to tie Defendants’ hands while the appellate process plays out,\nespecially given Plaintiffs’ lack of a viable claim and given the national security\nconsiderations present in this case.\n30",

On February 15, 2019, President Donald Trump invoked his authority under the \n3  National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. §§ 1601–1651, to declare a national emergency and divert \n4  billions of dollars appropriated for other purposes to carry out his campaign promise to build a wall \n5  along the U.S.-Mexico border.  \n6  2.  The President’s declaration was made solely out of disagreement with Congress’s \n7  decision about the proper funding level, location, and timetable for constructing a border wall. On \n8  the same day that President Trump signed his declaration, he also signed an act of Congress \n9  appropriating only $1.375 billion for the border wall. The law Congress passed not only denied the \n10  President the additional billions he had demanded, but also imposed substantial restrictions on the \n11  location and timing of border wall construction.  \n12  3.  In announcing his declaration of a national emergency, the President stated, “I don’t \n13  need to do this,” but explained that he preferred to build the border wall faster than Congress’s \n14  appropriation would allow. \n15  4.  The President’s declaration plainly states that the invocation of an emergency is to \n16  address a “long-standing” problem of “large-scale unlawful migration through the southern border” \n17  and the President’s opinion that the number of families seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border \n18  presents an “emergency.” In fact, there was and is no national emergency to justify the President’s \n19  action, only his disagreement with Congress’s duly enacted decisions on the extent and pace of \n20  spending on the border wall. \n21  5.  On its face, the declaration does not meet the requirements of the statutory \n22  authorization that the President invokes, 10 U.S.C. § 2808. That law, duly enacted by Congress, \n23  provides that the President may declare an emergency to deploy military construction funds “that are \n24  necessary to support such [emergency] use of the armed forces.” The declaration does not set forth \n25  any actual emergency, any use of the armed forces required to address such an emergency, or how a \n26  diversion of military construction funds is necessary to support the use of the armed forces of the \n27  United States. The President has also instructed his subordinates to divert additional sources of \n28 \n1 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: __________ \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-KAW   Document 1   Filed 02/19/19   Page 4 of 33\n1  Departments of Defense and Treasury funds that Congress restricted for other purposes, in an effort \n2  to secure the appropriations that Congress denied him for the border wall.  \n3  6.  Neither a declaration of emergency nor the Defense and Treasury funding statutes the \n4  administration has invoked permit the President to disregard Congress’s enacted appropriations \n5  legislation. The President’s actions violate both those statutes and the Constitution. \n6  7.  Plaintiffs Sierra Club and Southern Border Communities Coalition are harmed by the \n7  President’s unlawful declaration of a national emergency and bring this action seeking declaratory \n8  and injunctive relief and other remedies as set forth below. \n9  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n10  8.  This case arises under the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019, Pub. Law No. \n11  116-6; Article I, section 9, clause 7 of the U.S. Constitution; Article I, section 7 of the U.S. \n12  Constitution; the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. § 4332; the Administrative \n13  Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701–706, and other acts of Congress. This Court has subject matter \n14  jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 (federal question), 1361 (mandamus), 1651 (All Writs Act) and \n15  2201 (declaratory relief). \n16  9.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1) because the defendants are agencies of \n17  the United States and officers of the United States acting in their official capacity and (1) at least one \n18  plaintiff resides in this district; and/or (2) a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to \n19  the claims occurred in this district.  \n20  10.  In addition to the harm caused to Plaintiff Sierra Club described below, the \n21  challenged action will have an impact throughout the Northern District of California, including in \n22  Contra Costa County and Monterey County, where the Department of Defense maintains several \n23  bases and facilities. The challenged action jeopardizes millions of dollars of Department of Defense \n24  funding for constructions projects at military bases in this District. \n25  PARTIES \n26  11.  Plaintiff Sierra Club is incorporated in the State of California as a nonprofit public \n27  benefit corporation with headquarters in Oakland, California. Sierra Club is a national organization \n28  with 67 chapters and more than 825,000 members dedicated to exploring, enjoying, and protecting \n2 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: __________ \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-KAW   Document 1   Filed 02/19/19   Page 5 of 33\n1  the wild places of the earth; to educating and enlisting humanity to protect and restore the quality of \n2  the natural and human environment; and to using all lawful means to carry out these objectives. \n3  Many of Sierra Club’s members reside, work, recreate, and/or enjoy areas along the border of the \n4  United States and Mexico. Sierra Club has more than 400,000 members in California, over 9,700 of \n5  whom belong to its San Diego Chapter. Sierra Club’s Grand Canyon Chapter, which covers the State \n6  of Arizona, has more than 16,000 members. Sierra Club’s Rio Grande Chapter includes over 10,000 \n7  members in New Mexico and West Texas. Sierra Club’s Lone Star Chapter, which covers the State \n8  of Texas, has more than 26,100 members, more than 440 of whom live in the Lower Rio Grande \n9  Valley.  \n10  12.  Sierra Club’s nationwide advocacy includes educating and mobilizing the public on \n11  issues of habitat destruction, divided local communities, land use, and myriad other human and \n12  environmental impacts associated with border wall construction activities. Sierra Club is committed \n13  to the protection of threatened and endangered species that inhabit the areas surrounding the \n14  proposed border walls as well as their habitat. Sierra Club has been actively involved in protecting \n15  habitat along the southern border for many years, including work to promote conservation on state, \n16  federal, and private lands along and adjacent to the border, and its members regularly use and enjoy \n17  areas along the border. Sierra Club members live near and regularly visit the California-Mexico \n18  border around San Diego for hiking, birdwatching, photography, and other recreational and aesthetic \n19  uses, and have worked to promote conservation of wildlife and habitat along the border.  \n20  13.  Sierra Club brings this action on its own behalf and on behalf of its members. Sierra \n21  Club members live near and frequently visit the parks, refuges, and other public lands along the \n22  United States-Mexico border for hiking, birdwatching, photography and other professional, \n23  scientific, recreational, and aesthetic uses. Among the areas visited by Sierra Club members are: the \n24  Tijuana Estuary (California), the Otay Mountain Wilderness (California), the Jacumba Wilderness \n25  Area (California), the Sonoran Desert (Arizona), Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge (Arizona), \n26  the Chihuahan Desert (New Mexico), Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge (Texas), the Lower Rio \n27  Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge (Texas), Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park (Texas), La \n28  Lomita Historical Park (Texas), and the National Butterfly Center (Texas). Sierra Club members \n3 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: __________ \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-KAW   Document 1   Filed 02/19/19   Page 6 of 33\n1  also reside, work, and recreate in and around cities and towns affected by the border wall, including \n2  but not limited to Santa Teresa, New Mexico; San Ysidro and Imperial Beach, California; Roma, \n3  Texas; Rio Grande City, Texas; Escobares, Texas; La Grulla, Texas; and Salineño, Texas. \n4  14.  Sierra Club’s members obtain recreational, professional, scientific, educational, and \n5  aesthetic benefits from their activities in these areas, and from wildlife dependent upon habitat that \n6  includes these areas. Sierra Club and its members have been and will continue to be injured by the \n7  construction of a border wall and related infrastructure. Such injuries are particularly significant \n8  because the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is proceeding with border work without first \n9  complying with decades-old environmental and public safety laws and regulations that were enacted \n10  for the very purpose of protecting the places, species, and values Sierra Club members work to \n11  protect. The requested relief will redress these injuries. \n12  15.  Sierra Club has devoted and continues to devote substantial resources to advocacy \n13  opposing the Department of Homeland Security’s border wall construction, intended to avoid the \n14  injuries to Sierra Club’s interests described above. Those efforts include formation of Sierra Club \n15  Borderlands, a coalition intended to investigate the environmental and social impacts of the border \n16  wall, and educate the public regarding those impacts. Sierra Club also devoted substantial staff and \n17  other resources towards legislative advocacy leading up to the appropriations bill passed by \n18  Congress in February 2019, specifically directed towards securing Congress’s denial of substantial \n19  funding to the border wall. Because of President Trump’s emergency declaration, Sierra Club has \n20  been forced to redirect resources to continue and amplify its advocacy—despite Congress’s decision \n21  to limit funding for near-term construction. For example, Sierra Club has allocated staff and \n22  volunteers within its national headquarters in Oakland to support veterans who intend to travel to \n23  Texas to oppose continued wall construction. As a result of the President’s emergency declaration, \n24  Sierra Club has also redirected staff and volunteers within its California offices to investigate and \n25  assess the extent of construction activities along the border in those areas outside those delineated by \n26  congressional appropriations, and the impacts of those activities.  \n27  16.  Plaintiff Southern Border Communities Coalition (“SBCC”) is a program of Alliance \n28  San Diego, a nonprofit public benefit corporation with headquarters in San Diego, California. SBCC \n4 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: __________ \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-KAW   Document 1   Filed 02/19/19   Page 7 of 33\n1  brings together 60 organizations from California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas to promote \n2  policies and solutions that improve quality of life in border communities, including fair border \n3  enforcement policies that respect human dignity and human rights and prevent loss of life, as well as \n4  rational and humane immigration-reform policies affecting the border region. Additionally, SBCC \n5  engages in oversight of U.S. Customs and Border Protection and its components, including Border \n6  Patrol, and advocates for accountability and transparency in the government policies and practices \n7  that impact border communities.  \n8  17.  SBCC brings this action on behalf of its members and on its own behalf. SBCC’s \n9  members live in and around the border lands impacted by the President’s declaration of a national \n10  emergency, in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. They recreate in and derive other \n11  benefits from public lands, including areas for which border barrier funding has not been \n12  appropriated or for which the deployment of funds has been prohibited. The ongoing and imminent \n13  construction of border infrastructure, including the border wall and fencing, will restrict members’ \n14  access to these and other lands, degrading their quality of life. It has additional negative \n15  consequences: dividing and fragmenting the communities in which SBCC members live; dividing \n16  the binational character of these communities by increasing members’ fears about traveling back-\n17  and-forth across the border; heightening racial division and promoting hostility towards immigrants \n18  and communities of color in border communities; and decreasing eco- and other forms of tourism \n19  that generate significant revenue.  \n20  18.  President Trump’s declaration also exposes SBCC’s membership to heightened risk \n21  from flooding, as well as risks to clean water, clean air and other natural resources. These threats are \n22  magnified by the government’s refusal to comply with constitutional and statutory limits on \n23  construction. The border wall directly harms members economically, culturally, recreationally, \n24  aesthetically, and religiously. The requested relief would redress these injuries. \n25  19.  Further, the declaration of a national emergency and the improper diversion of funds \n26  has already and will continue to impair SBCC’s mission and divert SBCC’s resources. SBCC has \n27  mobilized its staff and its affiliates to monitor and respond to the diversion of funds and the \n28  construction caused by and accompanying the national emergency declaration. It has organized, \n5 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: __________ \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-KAW   Document 1   Filed 02/19/19   Page 8 of 33\n1  supported, or participated in grassroots advocacy to respond to ongoing and imminent construction \n2  throughout the border lands, including in San Diego, Tucson, Las Cruces, El Paso, and the Rio \n3  Grande Valley, and will continue to do so in response to new construction caused by the President’s \n4  declaration. SBCC has responded locally and nationally to the President’s declaration to highlight \n5  the impacts it will have on border communities. It has engaged in rapid-response political outreach \n6  and advocacy. And it has responded to several calls from local officials, congressional \n7  representatives, and the public about the President’s national emergency declaration and the impacts \n8  it will have on the border lands and on border communities, providing information, guidance, and \n9  support to organizations and individuals that depend on SBCC. The time and cost associated with \n10  these activities has interfered with SBCC’s core advocacy regarding border militarization, Border \n11  Patrol law-enforcement activities, and immigration reform. SBCC must take these actions in \n12  furtherance of its mission to improve the quality of life in border communities. \n13  20.  Defendant DONALD J. TRUMP is the President of the United States, and is sued in \n14  his official capacity. \n15  21.  Defendant PATRICK M. SHANAHAN, Acting Secretary of Defense, is sued in his \n16  official capacity. Acting Secretary Shanahan is responsible for ensuring that Department of Defense \n17  actions comply with applicable laws. Acting Secretary Shanahan is responsible for carrying out the \n18  diversion of military construction funds for the construction of the border wall under President \n19  Trump’s declaration of national emergency. \n20  22.  Defendant KIRSTJEN M. NIELSEN, Secretary of Homeland Security, is sued in her \n21  official capacity. Secretary Nielsen is responsible for ensuring that Department of Homeland \n22  Security actions comply with applicable laws. Secretary Nielsen is responsible for carrying out the \n23  construction of the border wall and otherwise implementing President Trump’s declaration of \n24  national emergency. \n25  23.  Defendant STEVEN MNUCHIN, Secretary of the Treasury, is sued in his official \n26  capacity. Secretary Mnuchin is responsible for carrying out the diversion of Treasury funds for the \n27  construction of the border wall under President Trump’s declaration of national emergency. \n28   \n6 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: __________ \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-KAW   Document 1   Filed 02/19/19   Page 9 of 33\n1  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n2  24.  On February 15, 2019, President Trump declared a national emergency in order to \n3  secure funding for his border wall. The President’s declaration came after a weeks-long stalemate \n4  between the President and Congress, during which the President repeatedly threatened to declare a \n5  national emergency if Congress did not fund the construction of the border wall to the extent and at \n6  the pace the President preferred. \n7  25.  Contrary to the appropriations bills duly enacted by Congress for construction of \n8  border barriers, which included specific limitations and “carve-out” areas, President Trump has \n9  repeatedly stated that he will build a “big, beautiful” 1,000 mile-long wall along the U.S.-Mexico \n10  border.  \n11  26.  Congress’s latest appropriation for the border wall—enacted specifically in response \n12  to the President’s call for action to end an impasse that included a six-week government shutdown—\n13  included only $1.375 billion. In announcing his declaration of national emergency, however, \n14  President Trump expressly disagreed with Congress’s appropriation decision and instead called for \n15  more than $8 billion for border wall construction. \n \n16 \n \nPresident Trump Has Repeatedly Failed to Secure from Congress his Desired Level of \n17 \nAppropriations for Wall Construction. \n18  27.  Since taking office in 2017, President Trump and his executive branch officials have \n19  sought appropriations to fund construction of the border wall. In its repeated appropriation requests, \n20  the Trump administration has acknowledged that it cannot build a border wall without congressional \n21  authorization.  \n22  28.  In March 2017, the President asked Congress for $1.4 billion for the border wall for \n23  the remainder of fiscal year 2017, and an additional $2.6 billion for fiscal year 2018. On May 1, \n24  2017, Congress agreed on a bipartisan bill to fund the government through September 30, 2017. \n25  Congress rejected the President’s request for wall funding, but increased spending on border security \n26  by $1.5 billion. Three days after tweeting that the country “needs a good ‘shutdown’ in September,” \n27  the President signed the bill on May 5, 2017. \n28 \n7 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: __________ \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-KAW   Document 1   Filed 02/19/19   Page 10 of 33\n1  29.  On March 23, 2018, Congress rejected the President’s request for $1.6 billion to build \n2  a border wall in the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas. Congress instead allocated $1.6 billion for \n3  border security including new technology and repairs to existing barriers, as well as $641 million for \n4  about 33 miles of new fencing that had been authorized by the Secure Fence Act of 2006, Public \n5  Law 109–367.  \n6  30.  Congress did not accede to the President’s requests for more border wall funding \n7  throughout the remainder of 2018.  \n \n8 \n \n9 \nPresident Trump Refuses to Sign a Congressional Appropriations Package that Does Not \nInclude his Desired Amount of Border Wall Funding and Threatens to Declare a National \n10 \nEmergency. \n11  31.  On December 11, 2018, during his latest round of budget negotiations with Congress, \n12  the President announced that he would be “proud” to shut down the government if he did not receive \n13  his requested $5.7 billion in wall funding. When it was clear that both chambers of Congress would \n14  pass funding legislation necessary to keep the federal government open, President Trump declared \n15  that he would not sign any funding legislation—including legislation unanimously approved by the \n16  Senate to keep the government funded through February 8, 2019—without $5 billion to build his \n17  proposed border wall. \n18  32.  On December 21, 2018, the United States entered into a partial government \n19  shutdown. The shutdown would last 35 days, making it the longest in the nation’s history. President \n20  Trump threatened to draw the shutdown out for “a very long period of time—months or even \n21  years”—unless Congress gave him the money he was demanding for the border wall. \n22  33.  As the shutdown ground on, President Trump attempted to strike a compromise. He \n23  announced on January 19, 2019, that he was willing to temporarily extend the Deferred Action for \n24  Childhood Arrivals and Temporary Protected Status programs in exchange for $5.7 billion for a \n25  border wall. Democratic leaders rejected the proposal as a “non-starter” that merely put forth \n26  previously rejected offers. They urged the President to open the government before beginning \n27  negotiations over border security. \n28 \n8 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: __________ \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-KAW   Document 1   Filed 02/19/19   Page 11 of 33\n1  34.  Frustrated by Congress’s consistent rejection of his demand for funding, President \n2  Trump threatened to declare a national emergency and build a wall without congressional approval. \n3  According to the President, he could “call a national emergency and build it very quickly.” \n4  35.  For several weeks, President Trump repeated his threat to invoke a national \n5  emergency to circumvent Congress’s funding authority. On January 9, 2019, he stated that “I have \n6  an absolute right to do national emergency if I want,” and revealed that his “threshold” for invoking \n7  the emergency would be if he “can’t make a deal with people that are unreasonable.” \n8  36.  On January 10, 2019, the President referred to ongoing negotiations with the House \n9  and the Senate and said “If this doesn’t work out, probably I will [declare a national emergency]. I \n10  would almost say definitely.” He explained that “[i]f we don’t make a deal, I would say 100 percent, \n11  but I don’t want to say 100 percent,” and that “[i]f we don’t make a deal, I would say it would be \n12  very surprising to me that I would not declare a national emergency and just fund it through the \n13  various mechanisms.” \n14  37.  Despite encouragement from Senate Republicans to agree to reopen the government \n15  for a short period to negotiate with Democrats, President Trump promised to remain steadfast in his \n16  demands for a wall along the United States-Mexico border. He would not declare a national \n17  emergency “so fast,” he said, because, although “[i]t’s the easy way out, . . . Congress should do it.”  \n18  38.  On January 25, 2019, faced with worsening national gridlock as a result of the 35-day \n19  shutdown, President Trump agreed to sign legislation that would keep the government open until \n20  February 15, 2019. This stopgap legislation did not include any funding for a border wall and had \n21  previously been rejected by the President.  \n22  39.  In ending the government shutdown, the President stated that if he were unable to \n23  “work with the Democrats and negotiate,” then “obviously we’ll do the emergency because that’s \n24  what it is. It’s a national emergency.” \n25  40.  After the shutdown ended, a bipartisan committee of negotiators from the House and \n26  Senate began work on a compromise appropriations bill that would include some funding for border \n27  security. President Trump publicly expressed his skepticism that negotiations would be fruitful, \n28 \n9 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: __________ \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-KAW   Document 1   Filed 02/19/19   Page 12 of 33\n1  declaring that the negotiators were “wasting their time” and that he would “get [the wall] built one \n2  way or the other.” \n3  41.  On January 31, 2019, President Trump stated that “we’ve set the stage for what’s \n4  going to happen on February 15 if a deal is not made.” The next day, he said “I think there’s a good \n5  chance that we’ll have to do” an emergency proclamation.  \n6  42.  As House and Senate negotiators deliberated over a deal to avert another government \n7  shutdown, Trump administration officials started laying the groundwork for a possible national \n8  emergency declaration. Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney stated that “[w]e’ll take \n9  as much money as [Congress] can give us and then we’ll go off and find the money someplace \n10  else…but [the wall] is going to get built with or without Congress.”  \n11  43.  On February 11, 2019, congressional negotiators finalized a funding deal. The \n12  agreement included $1.375 billion for fencing and other physical barriers along 55 miles of the U.S.-\n13  Mexico border and included numerous restrictions on the timing and location of construction.  \n14  44.  President Trump stated that he was “not happy” with Congress’s compromise deal \n15  and would find “other methods” to finance a wall without explicit approval form Congress.  \n \n16 \n \nCongress Considered and Specifically Rejected the President’s Wall Funding Demands in \n17 \nEnacting the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019. \n18  45.  On February 14, 2019, Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of \n19  2019. \n20  46.  Congress’s enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019 occurred \n21  against a backdrop of its consideration and rejection of the President’s $5.7 billion border wall \n22  demand. On December 20, 2018, the House of Representatives had passed a continuing resolution \n23  that met the President’s request for $5.7 billion in border wall funding. The Senate did not pass the \n24  same legislation. When both houses of Congress came to an agreement and enacted the Consolidated \n25  Appropriations Act of 2019, they elected to exclude the President’s requested $5.7 billion in wall \n26  funds. \n27  47.  The House Appropriations Committee Chair, Representative Nita Lowey, confirmed \n28  that congressional negotiators considered, and “frankly, . . . denie[d] the President billions of dollars \n10 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: __________ \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-KAW   Document 1   Filed 02/19/19   Page 13 of 33\n1  in funding for the concrete wall that he demanded.” Senator Patrick Leahy, Vice Chairman of the \n2  Senate Appropriations Committee, who was actively involved in negotiations on the 2019 \n3  Consolidated Appropriations Act, stated “[t]he agreement does not fund President Trump’s wasteful \n4  wall.” 165 Cong. Rec. S1362 (daily ed. Feb 14, 2019). \n5  48.  Congress’s appropriations judgment, as expressed in the law that passed both \n6  chambers, is that only $1.375 billion should be used to construct a border wall, and that such a wall \n7  must be limited geographically to the Rio Grande Valley Sector. The bill provided only a fraction of \n8  the $5.7 billion that the President demanded for the border wall, allocating $1.375 billion for roughly \n9  55 miles of pedestrian fencing in the Rio Grande Valley Sector of the southern border. The \n10  appropriations act includes numerous carve-outs that prevent wall construction in parks and wildlife \n11  areas, and requires the approval of local officials and a public comment period before initiating \n12  construction in cities situated along the border. \n13  49.  Congress specifically prohibited the use of any appropriated funds in specific sections \n14  of the Rio Grande Valley, forbidding the use of any funds to construct a barrier “(1) within the Santa \n15  Ana Wildlife Refuge; (2) within the Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park; (3) within La Lomita \n16  Historical Park; (4) within the National Butterfly Center; or (5) within or east of the Vista del Mar \n17  Ranch tract of the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge.” Pub. Law No. 116-6 § 231. \n18  50.  In addition, Congress forbade the use of appropriated funds for construction within \n19  the city limits of Roma, Texas; Rio Grande City, Texas; Escobares, Texas; La Grulla, Texas; and \n20  within Salineño, Texas, until local elected officials and the public have had an opportunity to \n21  comment on any plans for construction. Pub. Law No. 116-6 § 232. \n \n22 \n \nPresident Trump Declares a National Emergency, Instructing his Secretaries of Defense and \n23 \nHomeland Security to Construct his Wall in the Absence of Congressional Authorization. \n24  51.  President Trump stated that he would sign the appropriations bill and simultaneously \n25  declare a national emergency. According to the President, $1.375 billion from Congress is “not so \n26  much” for a border wall and the emergency declaration would allow him to supplement what \n27  Congress has authorized “[s]o we have a chance of getting close to $8 billion [and] . . . build a lot of \n28  wall.” \n11 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: __________ \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-KAW   Document 1   Filed 02/19/19   Page 14 of 33\n1  52.  On February 15, 2019, President Trump declared a national emergency in order to \n2  secure his preferred level of funding for his border wall. See “Presidential Proclamation on \n3  Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Southern Border of the United States” (“the \n4  Proclamation”).   \n5  53.  In announcing his declaration of national emergency, President Trump stated that he \n6  decided to declare an emergency because he was dissatisfied with the pace of Congress’s spending. \n7  “I wanted to do it faster. I could do the wall over a longer period of time. I didn’t need to do this, but \n8  I’d rather do it much faster.” \n9  54.  While admitting that the appropriations bill provided him with a substantial amount \n10  of border wall funding, the President declared that he was still “not happy with it” because “on the \n11  wall, [Congress] skimped.”  \n12  55.  The President also expressed his disdain for Congress’s decision to include carve-out \n13  areas where wall construction is prohibited, and emphasized the importance of a contiguous wall. \n14  “The only weakness is they [individuals crossing the southern border] go to a wall and then they go \n15  around the wall. They go around the wall and in . . . . They go through areas where you have no \n16  wall.” \n17  56.  The President acknowledged that he “went through Congress . . . made a deal . . . got \n18  almost $1.4 billion” and was “successful, in that sense.” Explaining his declaration of national \n19  emergency, he stated that he “could do the wall over a longer period of time” using congressionally \n20  authorized funds but that he’d “rather do it much faster.” \n21  57.  The President’s senior policy advisor, Stephen Miller, confirmed that emergency and \n22  supplemental funding would allow for the construction of “hundreds of miles” of border wall by \n23  September 2020—much faster than congressionally authorized funding would allow. \n24  58.  In describing the nature of the purported national emergency, the text of the \n25  Proclamation (attached and incorporated herein as Exhibit A) refers to a “long-standing” problem of \n26  “large-scale unlawful migration through the southern border” that has “worsened” in recent years \n27  due to “sharp increases in the number of family units entering and seeking entry to the United States \n28  and an inability to provide detention space” for them. It further states that these family units “are \n12 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: __________ \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-KAW   Document 1   Filed 02/19/19   Page 15 of 33\n1  often released into the country and are often difficult to remove from the United States because they \n2  fail to appear for hearings, do not comply with orders of removal, or are otherwise difficult to \n3  locate.” \n4  59.  The Proclamation states that “[b]ecause of the gravity of the current emergency \n5  situation, it is necessary for the Armed Forces to provide additional support to address the crisis.” \n6  The Proclamation further states “that this emergency requires use of the Armed Forces and, in \n7  accordance with section 301 of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. § 1631), that the \n8  construction authority provided in section 2808 of title 10, United States Code, is invoked and made \n9  available, according to its terms, to the Secretary of Defense.”  \n10  60.  The Proclamation directs the Secretary of Defense, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. § 2808, to \n11  order members of the Ready Reserve to “assist and support the activities of the Secretary of \n12  Homeland Security at the southern border” and orders the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland \n13  Security, “if necessary,” to take action for “transfer and acceptance of jurisdiction over border \n14  lands.”  \n15  61.  According to a “fact sheet” issued by the White House, entitled “President Donald J. \n16  Trump’s Border Security Victory,” the President has identified $3.6 billion to be reallocated from \n17  Department of Defense military construction projects pursuant to 10 U.S.C. § 2808, $601 million to \n18  be reallocated from the Treasure Forfeiture Fund, and $2.5 billion to be reallocated from Department \n19  of Defense funds for counterdrug activities. The use of such funds was duly limited by Congress to \n20  specific purposes pursuant to its authority under the Constitution.  \n21  62.  The President intends to spend approximately $8.1 billion for construction of the \n22  border wall, many times the $1.375 billion appropriated by Congress. \n23  63.  The President’s unlawful reallocation of military construction funds will jeopardize \n24  construction projects at military bases and sites across the country, including in this District and \n25  throughout California.  \n26  64.  The Trump administration has explained that the President’s previous $5.7 billion \n27  request for border wall construction will “fund construction of a total of approximately 234 miles of \n28  new physical barrier and fully fund the top 10 priorities in CBP’s Border Security Improvement \n13 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: __________ \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-KAW   Document 1   Filed 02/19/19   Page 16 of 33\n1  Plan.” See Jan. 6, 2019 letter from Russell T. Vought, OMB Acting Director, to Senator Richard \n2  Shelby, Appropriations Committee Chairman. \n3   \n4  Construction of President Trump’s Wall Will Have Devastating Effects on the Environment.  \n5  65.  Through the expenditure of diverted emergency funds in 2019, the administration \n6  expects to continue with construction of “more than 330 miles of border wall in the U.S. Border \n7  Patrol’s highest priority locations across the Southwest border.” This includes areas all along the \n8  U.S.-Mexico border in which construction is ongoing. It also includes areas for which the \n9  Department of Homeland Security plans have been announced, contracts have been awarded, \n10  resources have been mobilized, or waivers have been issued.  \n11  66.  According to the Department of Homeland Security, in 2019 it will commence \n12  construction of 215 miles of border wall. This construction will occur in ecologically sensitive \n13  habitats and other border lands known for their outstanding hiking, wildlife viewing, photography, \n14  and wilderness values. For example, the Department of Homeland Security has notified the public it \n15  intends to commence wall construction in California’s San Diego and El Centro Sectors; Arizona’s \n16  Yuma Sector; New Mexico’s El Paso Sector; and, Texas’s Laredo and Rio Grande Valley Sectors.  \n17  67.  Examples of the environmental consequences can be seen in California’s San Diego \n18  and El Centro Sectors, where border wall construction would be devastating. Any new wall \n19  construction in these areas would be in or near the Otay Mountain Wilderness Area and the Jacumba \n20  Wilderness Area. These areas are habitat to more than 100 sensitive plant and animal species that are \n21  listed as “endangered,” “threatened,” or “rare” under the federal Endangered Species Act of 1973, 16 \n22  U.S.C. § 1531 et seq., and/or the California Endangered Species Act, Cal. Fish & Game Code § 2050 \n23  et seq. For example, the federally and state-endangered Peninsular Desert Bighorn sheep has a range \n24  that includes mountainous terrain in Mexico near the United States-Mexico border and extends north \n25  across the border through the Jacumba Wilderness to California’s Anza-Borrego State Park.  \n26  68.  Likewise, construction is imminent in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, \n27  notwithstanding Congress’s decision to prevent the Trump administration from building a wall in \n28  five areas nationally recognized for their ecological and recreational value. The administration’s \n14 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: __________ \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-KAW   Document 1   Filed 02/19/19   Page 17 of 33\n1  commitment to construct border walls in the Rio Grande Valley Sector means these areas are \n2  threatened with irreversible damage despite express Congressional direction to preserve them. Initial \n3  construction activities include accessing the project area with heavy equipment, creating and using \n4  staging areas, the conduct of earthwork, excavation, fill, and site preparation, and installation and \n5  upkeep of physical barriers, roads, supporting elements, drainage, erosion controls, safety features, \n6  lighting, cameras, and sensors. As a result of border wall construction, local communities would be \n7  more vulnerable to flooding, divided by border wall infrastructure, and suffer irreparable damage to \n8  cultural, historic, and recreational sites.  \n9  69.  In addition to ongoing and imminent construction, the President’s diversion of funds \n10  not appropriated by Congress to expand and expedite the border wall has injured the Sierra Club and \n11  SBCC. Both organizations have been compelled to respond to the declared emergency to safeguard \n12  their and their members’ interests, including by diverting resources from the organizations’ \n13  campaigns to unveil ongoing and imminent construction, educate their members, and respond to \n14  threats to their organizational missions. Staff and affiliates have participated in grassroots advocacy, \n15  engaged in rapid-response political outreach and advocacy with congressional and local elected \n16  officials, and responded to requests from their members, the public, and elected officials about the \n17  threat and implementation of unlawful expedited construction. The circumvention of legal processes, \n18  lack of transparency, notice, and consultation, have frustrated the organizations’ efforts to work \n19  towards their missions on behalf of their members. \n20  70.  Defendants have not conducted a public review of these activities’ impacts on the \n21  environment and local communities that complies with NEPA.  \n22 \nLEGAL BACKGROUND \n23 \nThe Constitution Vests Congress with Exclusive Authority to Determine the Appropriation of \n24 \nPublic Funds. \n25  71.  The Constitution bans the expenditure of any public funds by any branch of the \n26  federal government, including the Executive Branch, absent enactment of a law appropriating such \n27  funds: “No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by \n28  Law . . . .” U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 7. The Constitution thus vests Congress, and only Congress, \n15 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: __________ \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-KAW   Document 1   Filed 02/19/19   Page 18 of 33\n1  with the power to spend public funds, and it must do so by passing identical appropriations bills in \n2  both the House and the Senate. Public funds may only be expended as specified in such duly enacted \n3  appropriations laws. Except as specifically authorized by Congress, the Executive Branch has no \n4  authority to expend public funds that have not been thus appropriated. \n5  72.  The Appropriations Clause, in Article I, section 9, clause 7 of the Constitution, \n6  provides that “No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations \n7  made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public \n8  Money shall be published from time to time.” \n9  73.  The Appropriations Clause “assure[s] that public funds will be spent according to the \n10  letter of the difficult judgments reached by Congress as to the common good and not according to \n11  the individual favor of Government agents or the individual pleas of litigants.” Office of Pers. Mgmt. \n12  v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414, 428 (1990). \n13  74.  Congress also may enact authorization legislation to establish, continue, or modify an \n14  agency, program, or government function. Congressional authorization of a program, however, does \n15  not confer power on the Executive Branch to expend public funds. Only a specific appropriations \n16  law can do that. \n17  75.  Although Congress may combine an authorization and an appropriation in a single \n18  bill, it may (and most often does) enact them separately. In keeping with its broad constitutional \n19  authority, Congress may choose not to appropriate funds for an authorized program, or Congress \n20  may appropriate a different amount of money than the amount (if any) provided for in an \n21  authorization. Congress also may limit the purposes for which appropriated funds may be used.  \n22  76.  Appropriations laws generally take one of two forms: (a) temporary appropriations, \n23  which typically are enacted on an annual basis, and (b) permanent appropriations, which are few in \n24  number and which (i) remain in effect until Congress repeals or modifies them, and (ii) permit \n25  federal agencies to expend public funds without the need for passage of a temporary appropriations \n26  bill in the current Congress. For an appropriation to be considered permanent, the law must clearly \n27  and expressly so provide.  \n28 \n16 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: __________ \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-KAW   Document 1   Filed 02/19/19   Page 19 of 33\n1  77.  By providing funding to the Executive Branch through temporary (typically annual) \n2  appropriations, Congress ensures Executive Branch accountability by forcing the Executive Branch \n3  to return to Congress each year to seek continued funding for authorized agencies, programs, and \n4  government functions. This process provides Congress the opportunity to determine a suitable \n5  amount of funding after careful consideration. \n6  78.  Temporary appropriations also reinforce and further Congress’ constitutional \n7  responsibility to oversee the Executive Branch, and thereby act as a check upon the Executive \n8  Branch, as the Framers intended. \n9   \nThe Constitution Does Not Allow Appropriations to be Made by Executive Fiat, Rather than \n10 \nBy Law. \n11  79.  “It is for Congress, proceeding under the Constitution, to say what amount may be \n12  drawn from the Treasury in pursuance of an appropriation.” Hooe v. United States, 218 U.S. 322, \n13  333 (1910). If the Executive Branch spends money in violation of an appropriation law, “it would be \n14  drawing funds from the Treasury without authorization by statute and thus violating the \n15  Appropriations Clause.” United States v. McIntosh, 833 F.3d 1163, 1175 (9th Cir. 2016). \n16  80.  No statute can provide the President with authority to spend in excess of \n17  congressional limitations, or to draw money from the Treasury by executive declaration in a manner \n18  that contravenes the appropriations that have been made by law. “Any exercise of a power granted \n19  by the Constitution to one of the other branches of Government is limited by a valid reservation of \n20  congressional control over funds in the Treasury.” Office of Pers. Mgmt., 496 U.S. at 425. \n21  81.  Nor can Congress endow the President with the power to reallocate money within the \n22  federal budget by executive emergency declaration. “The Constitution is a compact enduring for \n23  more than our time, and one Congress cannot yield up its own powers, much less those of other \n24  Congresses to follow.” Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. at 452 (Kennedy, J., concurring). \n25   \nThe Constitution’s Presentment Clause Requires that the President Either Approve a Bill or \n26 \nReturn it to Congress with Objections. \n27 \n82.  The Presentment Clause, Article I, Section 7, Clause 2, provides that “[e]very Bill \n28 \nwhich shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a Law, \n17 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: __________ \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-KAW   Document 1   Filed 02/19/19   Page 20 of 33\n1  be presented to the President of the United States: If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall \n2  return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the \n3  Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it.” \n4  83.  The President has no constitutional authority to modify the appropriations bills passed \n5  by Congress. “There is no provision in the Constitution that authorizes the President to enact, to \n6  amend, or to repeal statutes.” Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. at 438. This restriction dates \n7  back to the founding: “Our first President understood the text of the Presentment Clause as requiring \n8  that he either approve all the parts of a Bill, or reject it in toto.” Id. at 440 (quotation marks omitted). \n9  84.  “Where the President does not approve a bill, the plan of the Constitution is to give to \n10  the Congress the opportunity to consider his objections and to pass the bill despite his disapproval.” \n11  Wright v. United States, 302 U.S. 583, 596 (1938).  \n12   \nCongress Has Strictly Restricted the Use of Appropriated Funds for Emergency Military \n13 \nConstruction Authority Under 10 U.S.C. § 2808. \n14 \n85.  Congress imposed binding restrictions on the President’s emergency powers to use \n15 \nmilitary construction funds for non-appropriated projects. Specifically, Congress limited the use of \n16 \nemergency military construction funds only for projects (a) undertaken during a national emergency \n17 \n“that requires use of the armed forces,” and (b) that “are necessary to support such use of the armed \n18 \nforces.” 10 U.S.C. § 2808.  \n19 \n86.  For purposes of Section 2808, Congress defines the term “military construction” as \n20 \nincluding “any construction, development, conversion, or extension or any kind carried out with \n21 \nrespect to a military installation . . . or any acquisition of land or construction of a defense access \n22 \nroad.” Congress defined “military installation” as a “base, camp, post, station, yard, center, or other \n23 \nactivity under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of a military department . . . .” 10 U.S.C. § 2801(a). \n24 \n87.  The emergency construction authority under 10 U.S.C. § 2808 has been used in the \n25 \npast only for military construction directly linked to a military installation connected to war efforts \n26 \nabroad and for protection of weapons of mass destruction.   \n27   \n28   \n18 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: __________ \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-KAW   Document 1   Filed 02/19/19   Page 21 of 33\nCongress Has Expressly Restricted the Use of Appropriated Funds for Military Construction \n1 \nof Border Fencing Under 10 U.S.C. § 284. \n2 \n88.  Congress imposed binding restrictions on the Secretary of Defense’s authority to \n3 \nprovide support for construction of border fences. Specifically, Congress authorized the use of \n4 \nDepartment of Defense support only for “[c]onstruction of roads and fences and installation of \n5 \nlighting to block drug smuggling corridors across international boundaries of the United States,” \n6 \nrather than across an entire international border. 10 U.S.C. § 284(b)(7). \n7 \n89.  In addition, Congress blocked the Secretary of Defense from redetermining the \n8 \nfunding balance struck by Congress, by permanently reallocating funding levels between the \n9 \nDepartment of Defense and other agencies. Accordingly, 10 U.S.C. § 277 provides that “to the \n10 \nextent otherwise required by section 1535 of title 31 (popularly known as the “Economy Act”) or \n11 \nother applicable law, the Secretary of Defense shall require a civilian law enforcement agency to \n12 \nwhich support is provided under this chapter to reimburse the Department of Defense for that \n13 \nsupport.” \n14 \n \nCongress Did Not Permit the President to Use the Treasury Forfeiture Fund as an \n15 \nUnrestricted Slush Fund. \n16 \n90.  Congress established the Department of the Treasury Forfeiture Fund to permit the \n17 \nuse of forfeited funds for specifically delineated law enforcement purposes. See 31 U.S.C. § 9705. \n18 \n91.  These purposes range from the payment of “compensation to informers,” “payment \n19 \nfor services of experts and consultants needed by a Department of Treasury law enforcement \n20 \norganization to carry out the organization’s duties relating to seizure and forfeiture,” and similar \n21 \nexpenditures relating to the seizure and forfeiture program. 31 U.S.C § 9705(a). \n22 \n92.  Congress did not authorize use of the Treasury Forfeiture Fund to pay for \n23 \nconstruction of a border wall. \n24 \n \nThe National Environmental Policy Act Requires Agencies to Consider and Make Public the \n25 \nEnvironmental Impact of Their Actions. \n26 \n93.  NEPA is the “basic national charter for protection of the environment.” 40 C.F.R. § \n27 \n1500.1(a) (1978). It was enacted with the ambitious objectives of “encourag[ing] productive and \n28 \nenjoyable harmony between man and his environment . . . to promote efforts which will prevent or \n19 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: __________ \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-KAW   Document 1   Filed 02/19/19   Page 22 of 33\n1  eliminate damage to the environment and biosphere and stimulating the health and welfare of man; \n2  and to enrich the understanding of the ecological systems and natural resources important to the \n3  Nation . . . .” 42 U.S.C. § 4321. \n4  94.  In order to achieve these goals, NEPA contains several “action forcing” procedures, \n5  most significantly the mandate to prepare an environmental impact statement (“EIS”) on major \n6  federal actions “significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.” Robertson v. Methow \n7  Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 348 (1989); 42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C).  \n8  95.  The Council on Environmental Quality (“CEQ”) was created to administer NEPA and \n9  has promulgated NEPA regulations, which are binding on all federal agencies. See 42 U.S.C. §§ \n10  4342, 4344; 40 C.F.R. §§ 1500–1508 (1978). \n11  96.  When a federal agency is not certain whether an EIS is required, it must prepare a \n12  briefer document, known as an environmental assessment (“EA”). 40 C.F.R. § 1508.9 (1978). If the \n13  agency concludes in an EA that an action may have significant impacts on the environment, then an \n14  EIS must be prepared. Id. § 1501.4. If an EA concludes that there are no significant impacts to the \n15  environment, the federal agency must provide a detailed statement of reasons why the action’s \n16  impacts are insignificant and issue a Finding of No Significant Impact (“FONSI”). Id. § 1508.13. \n17  97.  The Supreme Court has found that the preparation and public circulation of EISs and \n18  EAs promotes NEPA’s broad environmental objectives in two primary ways: “It ensures that the \n19  agency, in reaching its decision, will have available, and will carefully consider, detailed information \n20  concerning significant environmental impacts; it also guarantees that the relevant information will be \n21  made available to the larger audience that may also play a role in both the decision-making process \n22  and the implementation of that decision.” Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. at 349. \n23  98.  NEPA requires that “agencies shall integrate the NEPA process with other planning at \n24  the earliest possible time to insure that planning and decisions reflect environmental values, to avoid \n25  delays later in the process, and to head off potential conflicts.” 40 C.F.R. § 1501.2 (1978); id. § \n26  1502.5 (“An agency shall commence preparation of an [EIS] as close as possible to the time the \n27  agency is developing or is presented with a proposal . . . .”). The Ninth Circuit has interpreted these \n28 \n20 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: __________ \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-KAW   Document 1   Filed 02/19/19   Page 23 of 33\n1  regulations as requiring the NEPA process to be conducted “before any irreversible and irretrievable \n2  commitment of resources.” Connor v. Burford, 848 F.2d 1441, 1446 (9th Cir. 1998). \n3  99.   A “[p]roposal exists at that stage in the development of an action when an  \n4  agency . . . has a goal and is actively preparing to make a decision on one or more alternative means \n5  of accomplishing that goal and the effects can be meaningfully evaluated.” 40 C.F.R. § 1508.23. \n6  Actions are defined to “include new and continuing activities including projects and programs \n7  entirely or partly financed, assisted, conducted, regulated, or approved by federal agencies,” and \n8  include “[a]pproval of specific projects, such as construction or management activities located in a \n9  defined geographic area,” as well as “actions approved by permit or other regulatory decision as well \n10  as federal and federally assisted activities.” Id. §§ 1508.18(a) & (b)(4). \n11  100.  For activities covering multiple landscape types and jurisdictions, agencies may \n12  prepare a programmatic EIS (“PEIS”). A PEIS evaluates the effects of broad proposals or planning-\n13  level decisions that may include any or all of the following: a wide range of individual actions; \n14  implementation over a long timeframe; and/or implementation across a large geographic area. \n15  101.  The Department of Homeland Security has not promulgated regulations to implement \n16  NEPA, but has issued an Instruction Manual. Instruction Manual 023-01-001-01, Revision 01, \n17  Implementation of NEPA (Nov. 6, 2014) (“DHS NEPA Manual”). The Manual specifically includes \n18  “proposed construction, land use, activity, or operation that has the potential to significantly affect \n19  environmentally sensitive areas” as an action “normally requiring” the preparation of at least an EA. \n20  102.  Echoing the general NEPA requirements regarding the need to conduct NEPA early \n21  in the process, the DHS NEPA Manual directs the Department of Homeland Security to “integrate[] \n22  the NEPA process with other planning efforts at the earliest possible stage so that environmental \n23  factors are considered with sufficient time to have a practical influence on the decision-making \n24  process before decisions are made.” DHS NEPA Manual, at p. IV-1. The Manual directs that agency \n25  components that process applications for Department of Homeland Security funding or approval, \n26  “have a responsibility to integrate NEPA requirements early in the application process,” and to \n27  ensure that “completion of the NEPA process occurs before making a decision to approve” the \n28  proposal. \n21 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: __________ \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-KAW   Document 1   Filed 02/19/19   Page 24 of 33\n1  103.  NEPA requires that the Agencies involve the public in preparing and considering \n2  environmental documents that implement the Act. 40 C.F.R. § 1506.6; id. § 1506.6(b)(1) (requiring \n3  federal agencies to “[p]rovide public notice of NEPA-related hearings, public meetings, and the \n4  availability of environmental documents so as to inform those persons and agencies who may be \n5  interested or affected”). \n6  104.  The CEQ regulations further direct federal agencies to “insure that environmental \n7  information is available to public officials and citizens before decisions are made,” and mandate that \n8  “public scrutiny [is] essential to implementing NEPA.” 40 C.F.R. § 1500.1(b). \n9  105.  In analyzing an action’s environmental effects, an agency must also consider the \n10  effects of both: “connected actions,” meaning those that are “[c]losely related,” including actions \n11  that “[c]annot or will not proceed unless other actions are taken previously or simultaneously,” and \n12  actions that are “interdependent parts of a larger action and depend on the larger action for their \n13  justification”; and “cumulative actions,” meaning those that “when viewed with other proposed \n14  actions have cumulatively significant impacts.” 40 C.F.R. § 1508.25.  \n15  106.  The Ninth Circuit has held that a “complete failure to involve or even inform the \n16  public” about the agency’s preparation of a NEPA document violates the statute’s public \n17  participation requirements. Citizens for Better Forestry v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 341 F.3d 961, 970 \n18  (9th Cir. 2003). \n19  107.  Underlying all of NEPA’s procedural requirements is the mandate that agencies take \n20  a “hard look” at all of the environmental impacts and risks of a proposed action. As stated by the \n21  Ninth Circuit, “general statements about ‘possible effects’ and ‘some risk’ do not constitute a ‘hard \n22  look’ absent a justification regarding why more definitive information could not be provided.” Blue \n23  Mountains Biodiversity Project v. Blackwood, 161 F.3d 1208, 1213 (9th Cir. 1998) (internal citations \n24  omitted). \n25  DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n26  108.  Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury if Defendants take action to build a wall in \n27  reliance on the Proclamation, or in implementing the President’s direction to use funds pursuant to \n28  10 U.S.C. §§ 284, 2808 and 31 U.S.C § 9705, and Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n22 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: __________ \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-KAW   Document 1   Filed 02/19/19   Page 25 of 33\n1  CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n2 \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019, Pub. Law No. 116-6) \n3 \n109.  Neither the President nor any other federal official can take an action that exceeds the \n4 \nscope of their constitutional and/or statutory authority. \n5 \n110.  Congress has explicitly limited Defendants’ authority to construct a border wall \n6 \nthrough exercise of its constitutional appropriations power in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of \n7 \n2019. Congress’s appropriations judgment is that only $1.375 billion should be used to construct a \n8 \nborder wall, that such a wall must be limited geographically to 55 miles within the Rio Grande \n9 \nValley Sector, and that construction of a border wall should not proceed at this time with respect to \n10 \nnumerous areas specifically described in the law.  \n11 \n111.  Congress enacted the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019 against the backdrop \n12 \nof the President’s continued demand for $5.7 billion in unrestricted border wall funding for \n13 \nconstruction of a contiguous barrier between the United States and Mexico. “Congress has expressed \n14 \nits will to withhold this power from the President as though it had said so in so many words.” \n15 \nYoungstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 602 (1952) (Frankfurter, J., concurring). \n16 \n112.  The President has nonetheless instructed the Secretaries of Homeland Security and \n17 \nDefense to act beyond the limitations imposed by Congress by spending approximately $8.1 billion \n18 \nto build a wall across the border, in purported reliance on a patchwork of older, more general statutes \n19 \nthat are silent on wall construction. \n20 \n113.  The statutes the President purports to rely on, 10 U.S.C. §§ 284, 2808 and 31 U.S.C \n21 \n§ 9705, do not authorize wall construction outside of the limited geographic, monetary, and \n22 \nscheduling bounds set by Congress in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019. \n23 \n114.  “[T]he meaning of one statute may be affected by other Acts, particularly where \n24 \nCongress has spoken subsequently and more specifically to the topic at hand.” F.D.A. v. Brown & \n25 \nWilliamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 133 (2000). “This is particularly so where the scope of the \n26 \nearlier statute is broad but the subsequent statutes more specifically address the topic at hand.” Id. at \n27 \n143. Therefore, “a specific policy embodied in a later . . . statute should control [judicial] \n28 \n23 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: __________ \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-KAW   Document 1   Filed 02/19/19   Page 26 of 33\n1  construction of the [earlier broad] statute, even though it ha[s] not been expressly amended.” Id. \n2  (quotations and citations omitted; brackets in original).  \n3  115.  Use of funds under 10 U.S.C. § 2808 in accordance with the President’s Proclamation \n4  to construct the border wall violates the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019. It funds the wall \n5  in excess of the amount established by Congress and it denies funds from other projects that \n6  Congress chose to fund. \n7  116.  The President’s Proclamation does not meet the conditions required for invocation of \n8  10 U.S.C. § 2808 because it does not identify an emergency requiring use of the armed forces.  \n9  117.  The President’s Proclamation additionally does not meet the conditions required for \n10  invocation of 10 U.S.C. § 2808 because construction of a border wall is not a military construction \n11  project supporting the armed forces. \n12  118.  Use of funds under 10 U.S.C. § 284 to construct the border wall violates the \n13  Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019.  \n14  119.  The Department of Defense’s use of funds under 10 U.S.C. § 284 to construct a \n15  contiguous fence across the international boundaries of the United States is contrary to Congress’s \n16  requirement that construction under that statute must be limited to drug smuggling corridors.  \n17  120.  Congress did not delegate to the Secretary of Defense the decision to construct a \n18  contiguous fence across the southern border through a bill providing for military support of law \n19  enforcement activities. Interpretation of statutes “must be guided to a degree by common sense as to \n20  the manner in which Congress is likely to delegate a policy decision of such economic and political \n21  magnitude . . . .” Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. at 133. \n22  121.  In addition, use of funds under 10 U.S.C. § 284 to construct the border wall is \n23  contrary to Congress’s judgment in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019 because funds not \n24  appropriated for wall construction cannot be reimbursed to the Department of Defense under 10 \n25  U.S.C. § 277. \n26  122.  Use of the Treasury Forfeiture Fund under 31 U.S.C. § 9705 to construct the border \n27  wall violates the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019. Congress did not authorize use of the \n28  Treasury Forfeiture Fund to pay for construction of a border wall, and any general authorization for \n24 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: __________ \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-KAW   Document 1   Filed 02/19/19   Page 27 of 33\n1  use of funds in that statute must be interpreted against Congress’s more specific passage of the \n2  Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019.  \n3  123.  Defendants are acting ultra vires in using funds to construct the border wall beyond \n4  the restrictions Congress imposed in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019.  \n5   \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n6 \n(Separation of Powers, Article I, Section 9, Clause 7 of the Constitution) \n7 \n124.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n8 \n125.  Defendants may not “draw[] [Money] from the Treasury, but in Consequence of \n9 \nAppropriations made by Law.” U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 7.  \n10 \n126.  Congress has explicitly limited Defendants’ authority to construct a border wall \n11 \nthrough exercise of its constitutional appropriations power in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of \n12 \n2019.  \n13 \n127.  The President has nonetheless instructed the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland \n14 \nSecurity to act beyond the limitations imposed by Congress by spending approximately $8.1 billion \n15 \nto build a wall across the border.  \n16 \n128.  “It is one thing to draw an intention of Congress from general language and to say \n17 \nthat Congress would have explicitly written what is inferred, where Congress has not addressed itself \n18 \nto a specific situation. It is quite impossible, however, when Congress did specifically address itself \n19 \nto a problem . . . to find secreted in the interstices of legislation the very grant of power which \n20 \nCongress consciously withheld. To find authority so explicitly withheld is not merely to disregard in \n21 \na particular instance the clear will of Congress. It is to disrespect the whole legislative process and \n22 \nthe constitutional division of authority between President and Congress.” Youngstown, 343 U.S. at \n23 \n609 (Frankfurter, J., concurring). \n24 \n129.  Because the statutes the President purports to rely on, 10 U.S.C. §§ 284, 2808 and 31 \n25 \nU.S.C § 9705, do not authorize wall construction outside of the limited geographic, monetary, and \n26 \nscheduling bounds set by Congress in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019, the use of those \n27 \nstatutes to fund border wall construction usurps Congress’s legislative authority and violates the \n28 \nConstitution’s separation of powers. \n25 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: __________ \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-KAW   Document 1   Filed 02/19/19   Page 28 of 33\n \n1 \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Appropriations Clause, Article I, Section 9, Clause 7 of the Constitution) \n2 \n130.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n3 \n131.  The Constitution only permits money to be withdrawn from the Treasury by an \n4 \nappropriation made by law. U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 7. \n5 \n132.  In the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019, Congress has appropriated only \n6 \n$1.375 billion for border wall construction.  \n7 \n133.  The President asserts that he has independent authority under 10 U.S.C. §§ 284 and \n8 \n2808 and 31 U.S.C § 9705 to order that billions more be spent on the wall than provided in those \n9 \nlegislative appropriations. The President has ordered the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland \n10 \nSecurity to implement his determination that additional billions be spent on construction of the \n11 \nborder wall. \n12 \n134.  Congress cannot give the President the authority to make an appropriation, including \n13 \nby statutes that provide authority for emergency proclamations.  \n14 \n135.  Congress cannot give the President authority to contravene restrictions on the use of \n15 \nTreasury funds for construction of a border wall, contained within an appropriations law that \n16 \nCongress has passed and the President has signed. \n17 \n136.  To the extent that 10 U.S.C. §§ 284 and 2808 and 31 U.S.C § 9705 authorize the \n18 \nPresident to allocate money from the Department of the Treasury by executive proclamation, rather \n19 \nthan by law, and in contravention of restrictions contained in Congress’s appropriations’ laws, they \n20 \nviolate the Constitution. \n21 \n \n22 \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n23  (Presentment Clause, Article I, Section 7, Clause 2) \n24  137.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n25  138.  The Presentment Clause requires that when Congress passes an appropriations bill, \n26  the President has only two options: he must sign it, or return it with his objections so that Congress \n27  may consider them. \n28 \n26 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: __________ \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-KAW   Document 1   Filed 02/19/19   Page 29 of 33\n1  139.  Instead of following this mandatory requirement, the President signed a bill to which \n2  he objected, and announced that he would use the National Emergencies Act to reallocate funds to \n3  his liking. \n4  140.  Because the President has purported to modify or repeal the appropriations bill passed \n5  by Congress, including by improperly relying on an emergency proclamation to lift restrictions \n6  Congress imposed on border wall funding in the appropriations bill, his actions violate the \n7  Presentment Clause. \n8  141.  To the extent that 10 U.S.C. §§ 284 and 2808 and 31 U.S.C § 9705 authorize the \n9  President to modify or repeal Congress’s appropriations legislation by executive proclamation, rather \n10  than by law, they violate the Constitution. \n \n11 \n \nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n12 \n(National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. § 4332) \n13 \n142.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth herein.  \n14 \n143.  The Secretaries of Defense, Homeland Security, and the Treasury must ensure that \n15 \ntheir agencies prepare an environmental impact statement on major Federal actions “significantly \n16 \naffecting the quality of the human environment,” and prepare an environmental assessment to \n17 \ndetermine whether any such significant effects exist. Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizen Council, \n18 \n490 U.S. 332, 348 (1989); Metcalf v. Daley, 214 F.3d 1135, 1142 (9th Cir. 2000); 42 U.S.C. § \n19 \n4332(2)(C). A federal agency “bears the primary responsibility to ensure that it complies with \n20 \nNEPA.” ’Ilio’Ulaokalani Coal. v. Rumsfeld, 464 F.3d 1083, 1092 (9th Cir. 2006). “When an agency \n21 \ndecides to proceed with an action in the absence of an EA or EIS, the agency must adequately \n22 \nexplain its decision.” Alaska Ctr. for Env’t v. U.S. Forest Serv., 189 F.3d 851, 859 (9th Cir. 1999).  \n23 \n144.   NEPA requires that the Defendants involve the public in preparing and considering \n24 \nenvironmental documents that implement the Act. 40 C.F.R. § 1506.6 (1978); id. § 1506.6(b)(1) \n25 \n(requiring federal agencies to “[p]rovide public notice of NEPA-related hearings, public meetings, \n26 \nand the availability of environmental documents so as to inform those persons and agencies who \n27 \nmay be interested or affected”). \n28 \n27 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: __________ \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-KAW   Document 1   Filed 02/19/19   Page 30 of 33\n1  145.  Border wall construction is a final agency action, for purposes of the Defendants’ \n2  obligations under NEPA. \n3  146.  As directed by Defendant Trump’s Proclamation, Defendants Shanahan, Nielsen, and \n4  Mnuchin violate NEPA and NEPA’s implementing regulations by authorizing border wall \n5  construction without first conducting the necessary environmental analysis of the impacts of the \n6  actions in an EA or EIS, or a programmatic EIS, in light of the potentially significant impacts that \n7  the action will have, including both cumulative effects and the effects of connected actions.  \n8  147.  As directed by Defendant Trump’s Proclamation, Defendants Shanahan, Nielsen, and \n9  Mnuchin further violate NEPA and NEPA’s implementing regulations by failing to initiate and \n10  complete NEPA at the earliest possible time in the planning process.  \n11  148.  As directed by Defendant Trump’s Proclamation, Defendants Shanahan, Nielsen, and \n12  Mnuchin have utterly failed and/or refused to involve the public in its decision-making processes for \n13  border construction. This failure to provide for any public participation in relation to their approval \n14  of border wall construction violates NEPA and its implementing regulations. \n \n15 \n \nSIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n16 \n(Ultra Vires) \n17  149.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n18  150.  Defendants are acting ultra vires in seeking to divert funding pursuant to 10 U.S.C. § \n19  2808 for failure to meet the criteria required under that statute. There is no emergency requiring the \n20  use of the armed forces along the U.S.-Mexico border, construction of a border wall is not a \n21  “military construction project,” and construction of a border wall is not “necessary to support such \n22  use of the armed forces.” \n23  151.  Defendants are acting ultra vires in seeking to divert funding pursuant to 10 U.S.C. § \n24  284 for failure to meet the criteria required under that statute. Construction of the border wall does \n25  not constitute the construction of a road or fence to block “drug smuggling corridors.” In addition, \n26  use of funds under 10 U.S.C. § 284 to construct the border wall in the face of Congress’s judgment \n27  that additional money should not be spent on the wall would violate the Consolidated Appropriations \n28 \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: __________ \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-KAW   Document 1   Filed 02/19/19   Page 31 of 33\n1  Act of 2019 because such money, having not been appropriated for wall construction, cannot be \n2  reimbursed to the Department of Defense under 10 U.S.C. § 277. \n3  152.  Defendants are acting ultra vires in seeking to divert funding pursuant to 31 U.S.C. § \n4  9705 because they fail to meet the criteria required under that statute. Congress did not authorize use \n5  of the Treasury Forfeiture Fund to pay for construction of a border wall, and the general \n6  authorization for use of funds in that statute is controlled by Congress’s more specific passage of the \n7  Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019. \n \n8 \n \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n9 \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray that this Court:  \n10 \n(A)  Declare the President’s direction that the Defense Department reallocate funds to \n11 \nsupport construction of a border wall under 10 U.S.C. § 2808 to be ultra vires, in \n12 \nexcess of presidential authority under Article II of the Constitution, an infringement \n13 \non legislative authority, a violation of the Presentment Clause, and invalid;  \n14 \n(B)  Enjoin Defendants Shanahan, Nielsen, and Mnuchin from taking action to build a \n15 \nborder wall using funds from the Defense Department or Treasury Asset Forfeiture \n16 \nFund, or on any basis that depends on the President’s unlawful emergency \n17 \ndeclaration; \n18 \n(C)  Declare that Defendants Shanahan, Nielsen, and Nielsen have violated NEPA and its \n19 \nimplementing regulations with respect to the border wall project by, inter alia, failing \n20 \nto conduct any NEPA analysis, failing to provide any opportunity for public \n21 \nparticipation, and failing to take a “hard look” at the potential environmental impacts \n22 \nof the border wall project; \n23 \n(D)  Enjoin Defendants Shanahan, Nielsen, and Mnuchin from implementing the border \n24 \nwall project until and unless Defendants comply with NEPA, the Endangered Species \n25 \nAct, and the implementing regulations for those laws; \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nCASE NO: __________ \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-KAW   Document 1   Filed 02/19/19   Page 32 of 33\n1  (E)  Award Plaintiffs their reasonable costs of litigation, including reasonable attorneys’ \n2  fees and costs, pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2412 and/or \n3  other authority; and  \n4  (F)  Grant such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. \n \n5 \nDated:  February 19, 2019  Respectfully submitted,  \n   \n6 \n  /s/ Cecillia D.

It \n4  is not about whether the plan is the right or wrong policy response to existing conditions at the \n5  southern border of the United States.  These policy questions are the subject of extensive, and \n6  often intense, differences of opinion, and this Court cannot and does not express any view as to \n7  them.  See Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392, 2423 (2018) (indicating that the Supreme Court \n8  “express[ed] no view on the soundness of the policy” at issue there); In re Border Infrastructure \n9  Envtl. Litig., 284 F. Supp. 3d 1092, 1102 (S.D. Cal. 2018) (noting that the court “cannot and does \n10  not consider whether underlying decisions to construct the border barriers are politically wise or \n11  prudent”).  Instead, this case presents strictly legal questions regarding whether the proposed plan \n12  for funding border barrier construction exceeds the Executive Branch’s lawful authority under the \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Constitution and a number of statutes duly enacted by Congress.  See In re Aiken Cty., 725 F.3d \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  255, 257 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (“The underlying policy debate is not our concern. . . .  Our more \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  modest task is to ensure, in justiciable cases, that agencies comply with the law as it has been set \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  by Congress.”). \nS d nr\nee 17  Assessing whether Defendants’ actions not only conform to the Framers’ contemplated \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  division of powers among co-equal branches of government but also comply with the mandates of \n19  Congress set forth in previously unconstrued statutes presents a Gordian knot of sorts.  But the \n20  federal courts’ duty is to decide cases and controversies, and “[t]hose who apply the rule to \n21  particular cases, must of necessity expound and interpret that rule.”  See Marbury v. Madison, 1 \n22  Cranch 137, 177 (1803).  Rather than cut the proverbial knot, however, the Court aims to untie \n23  it—no small task given the number of overlapping legal issues.  And at this stage, the Court then \n24  must further decide whether Plaintiffs have met the standard for obtaining the extraordinary \n25  remedy of a preliminary injunction pending resolution of the case on the merits. \n26  After carefully considering the parties’ arguments, the Court GRANTS IN PART and \n27  DENIES IN PART Plaintiffs’ motion. \n28  // \n2 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 3 of 56\n \n1  I.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n2  The President has long voiced support for a physical barrier between the United States and \n3  Mexico.  See, e.g., Request for Judicial Notice, California v. Trump, No. 4:19-cv-00872-HSG \n4  (N.D. Cal. Apr. 8, 2019), ECF No. 59-4 (“States RJN”) Ex. 3 (June 16, 2016 Presidential \n5  Announcement Speech) (“I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, \n6  believe me, and I’ll build them very inexpensively, I will build a great, great wall on our southern \n7  border.  And I will have Mexico pay for that wall.”).2  Upon taking office in 2017, the President’s \n8  administration repeatedly sought appropriations from Congress for border barrier construction.  \n9  See, e.g., Budget of the U.S. Government: A New Foundation for American Greatness: Fiscal Year \n10  2018, Office of Mgmt. & Budget 18 (2017), https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-\n11  content/uploads/2017/11/budget.pdf (requesting “$2.6 billion in high-priority tactical \n12  infrastructure and border security technology, including funding to plan, design, and construct a \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  physical wall along the southern border”).  Congress provided some funding, including $1.571 \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  billion for fiscal year 2018.  See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, Pub. L. No. 115-141, div. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  F, tit. II, § 230(a) 132 Stat. 348 (2018).  And Congress considered several bills that, if passed, \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  would have authorized or otherwise appropriated billions of dollars more for border barrier \nS d nr\nee 17  construction.  See States RJN Exs. 14–20.  None passed.   \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  In December 2018—as Congress and the President were negotiating an appropriations bill \n19  to fund various federal departments for what remained of the fiscal year—the President announced \n20  that he would not sign any funding legislation that lacked substantial funds for border barrier \n21  construction.  Farm Bill Signing, C-SPAN (Dec. 20, 2018), https://www.c-\n22 \n                                                 \n23 \n2 Defendants do not oppose the Plaintiff States’ request to take judicial notice of various \ndocuments.  The Court finds it may take judicial notice of documents from Plaintiff States’ request \n24 \nthat are cited in this order, all of which are: (1) statements of government officials or entities that \nare not subject to reasonable dispute; (2) bills considered by Congress or other legislative history; \n25 \nor (3) other public records and government documents available on reliable internet sources, such \nas government websites.  See DeHoog v. Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV, 899 F.3d 758, 763 n.5 \n26 \n(9th Cir. 2018) (taking “judicial notice of government documents, court filings, press releases, and \nundisputed matters of public record”); Hawaii v.

Any measure that funds the government must include border \n3  security. . . .  Walls work whether we like it or not.  They work better than anything.”).  Congress \n4  did not pass a bill with the President’s desired border barrier funding and, due to this impasse, the \n5  United States entered into the nation’s longest partial government shutdown.   \n6  The President and those in his administration stated on several occasions before, during, \n7  and after the shutdown that, although Congress should make the requisite funds available for \n8  border barrier construction, the President was willing to use a national emergency declaration and \n9  other reprogramming mechanisms as funding backstops.  For example, during a December 11, \n10  2018 meeting with congressional representatives, the President stated that “if we don’t get what \n11  we want [for border barrier construction funding], one way or the other – whether it’s through \n12  [Congress], through a military, through anything you want to call [sic] – I will shut down the \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  government.  Absolutely.”  States RJN Ex. 21.  The White House initially requested only $1.6 \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  billion for border barrier construction for the fiscal year 2019 budget, for sixty-five miles of border \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  barrier construction “in south Texas.”  See Supplemental Request for Judicial Notice, California v. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Trump, No. 4:19-cv-00872-HSG (N.D. Cal. Apr. 8, 2019), ECF No. 112-1, Ex. 51, at 58.  \nS d nr\nee 17  However, the White House increased its request on January 6, 2019, when the Acting Director of \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  the Office of Management and Budget transmitted a letter to the U.S. Senate Committee on \n19  Appropriations, “request[ing] $5.7 billion for construction of a steel barrier for the Southwest \n20  border,” and explaining that the request “would fund construction of a total of approximately 234 \n21  miles of new physical barrier.”  See Dkt. No. 36 (“Citizen Groups RJN”) Ex. A, at 1.3  The \n22  increased request specified that “[a]ppropriations bills for fiscal year (FY) 2019 that have already \n23  been considered by the current and previous Congresses are inadequate to fully address these \n24  critical issues,” including the need for border barrier construction funds.  Id.  Days later, the \n25  President explained:  “If we declare a national emergency, we have a tremendous amount of funds \n26 \n                                                 \n27 \n3 The Court takes judicial notice of documents submitted by the Citizen Group Plaintiffs, \nconsideration of which Defendants do not oppose, and the accuracy of the contents of which \n28 \nsimilarly “cannot be questioned.”  See discussion supra note 2. \n4 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 5 of 56\n \n1  – tremendous – if we want to do that, if we want to go that route.  Again, there is no reason why \n2  we can’t come to a deal. . . .  [Congress] could stop this problem in 15 minutes if they wanted to.”   \n3  States RJN Ex. 13. \n4  After the government shutdown ended, the President and others in his administration \n5  reaffirmed their intent to fund a border barrier, with or without Congress’s blessing.  On February \n6  9, 2019, the President explained that even if Congress provided less than the requested funding for \n7  a border barrier, the barrier “[would] get built one way or the other!”  Citizen Groups RJN Ex. C.  \n8  The next day, the Acting White House Chief of Staff explained that the Administration intended to \n9  accept whatever funding Congress would offer and then use other measures to reach the \n10  President’s desired funding level for border barrier construction:   \n \n11  The President is going to build a wall.  You saw what the Vice-\nPresident said there, and that’s our attitude at this point, which is:  \na  12  We’ll take as much money as you can give us, and then we’ll go off \ntr in and find the money someplace else, legally, in order to secure that \nuoro 13  southern barrier.  But this is going to get built, with or without \nCfi\nt la Congress. \nciC 14   \nrts fo\niD tc 15  See Fox News, Mick Mulvaney on chances of border deal, Democrats ramping up investigation of \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Trump admin, YouTube (Feb. 10, 2019), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_Z0xx_zS0M.  He \nS d nr\nee 17  went on to detail that the Administration was prepared to both reprogram money and declare a \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  national emergency to unlock funds:  \n \n19  There are other funds of money that are available to [the President] \nthrough what we call reprogramming.  There is money that he can get \n20  at and is legally allowed to spend, and I think it -- needs to be said \nagain and again that all of this is going to be legal.  There are statutes \n21  on the books as to how any President can do this. . . .  There are certain \nfunds of money that he can  get  to  without declaring a national \n22  emergency and other funds that he can only get to after declaring a \nnational emergency.   \n23   \n24  Id.  All told, the “whole pot” of such funds was “well north of $5.7 billion.”  Id.  And with respect \n25  to a national emergency declaration in particular, the Acting White House Chief of Staff \n26  explained:  “The President doesn’t want to do it. . . .  He would prefer legislation because that’s \n27  the right way to go, and it’s the proper way to spend money in this country.”  Id. \n28  On February 14, 2019, Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019 \n5 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 6 of 56\n \n1  (“CAA”), Pub. L. No. 116-6, 133 Stat. 13 (2019).  The CAA consolidated separate appropriations \n2  acts related to different federal agencies into one bill, including for present purposes the DHS \n3  Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2019.  See id., div. A.  The CAA made available $1.375 \n4  billion—less than one quarter of the $5.7 billion sought by the President—“for the construction of \n5  primary pedestrian fencing, including levee pedestrian fencing, in the Rio Grande Valley Sector.”  \n6  Id. § 230(a)(1), 133 Stat. at 28.  Congress limited the use of these funds both as to the type of \n7  pedestrian fencing—only “operationally effective designs deployed as of the date of the \n8  Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 . . . such as currently deployed steel bollard designs”—and \n9  geographically—no funds were available for construction within (1) the Santa Ana Wildlife \n10  Refuge, (2) the Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park, (3) La Lomita Historical park, (4) the \n11  National Butterfly Center, or (5) within or east of the Vista del Mar Ranch tract of the Lower Rio \n12  Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge.  Id. §§ 230(b), 231, 133 Stat. at 28.  The CAA further \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  imposed notice and comment requirements prior to the use of any funds for the construction of \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  barriers within certain city limits.  Id. § 232, 133 Stat. at 28–29.  Section 739 of the CAA \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  provided: \n sir\net  \ntatsiD 16  None of the funds made available in this or any other appropriations \nS d nr Act may be used to increase, eliminate, or reduce funding for a \nee 17  program, project, or activity as proposed in the President’s budget \nth\nintr request for a fiscal year until such proposed change is subsequently \nUo\nN 18  enacted in  an appropriation Act, or unless such change is made \npursuant to the reprogramming or transfer provisions of this or any \n19  other appropriations Act. \n20  Id. § 739, 133 Stat. at 197. \n21  On February 15, 2019, the President not only signed the CAA into law but also issued a \n22  proclamation “declar[ing] that a national emergency exists at the southern border of the United \n23  States.”  Proclamation No. 9844, 84 Fed. Reg. 4,949 (Feb. 15, 2019).  In announcing the national \n24  emergency declaration, the President declared that although he “went through Congress” for the \n25  $1.375 billion in funding, he was “not happy with it.”  States RJN Ex. 50.  The President added: “I \n26  could do the wall over a longer period of time.  I didn’t need to do this.  But I’d rather do it much \n27  faster. . . .  And I think that I just want to get it done faster, that’s all.”  Id. \n28  The proclamation itself provided: \n6 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 7 of 56\n \n \n1  The current situation at the southern border presents a border security \nand humanitarian crisis that threatens core national security interests \n2  and constitutes a national emergency.  The southern border is a major \nentry point for criminals, gang members, and illicit narcotics.  The \n3  problem  of  large-scale  unlawful  migration  through  the  southern \nborder is long-standing, and despite the executive branch’s exercise \n4  of existing statutory authorities, the situation has worsened in certain \nrespects in recent years.  In particular, recent years have seen sharp \n5  increases in the number of family units entering and seeking entry to \nthe United States and an inability to provide detention space for many \n6  of these aliens while their removal proceedings are pending.  If not \ndetained, such aliens are often released into the country and are often \n7  difficult to remove from the United States because they fail to appear \nfor hearings, do not comply with orders of removal, or are otherwise \n8  difficult to locate.  In response to the directive in my April 4, 2018, \nmemorandum and subsequent requests for support by the Secretary of \n9  Homeland Security, the Department of Defense has provided support \nand resources to the Department of Homeland Security at the southern \n10  border.  Because of the gravity of the current emergency situation, it \nis necessary for the Armed Forces to provide additional support to \n11  address the crisis. \n12  Proclamation No. 9844, 84 Fed. Reg. 4,949.  The proclamation then invoked and made available \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  to relevant Department of Defense (“DoD”) personnel two statutory authorities.  First, the \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  proclamation made available the authority to “order any unit, and any member not assigned to a \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  unit organized to serve as a unit, in the Ready Reserve . . . to active duty for not more than 24 \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  consecutive months,” under 10 U.S.C. § 12302.  Id.  Second, the proclamation made available “the \nS d nr\nee 17  construction authority provided in [10 U.S.C. § 2808].”  Id.  As is necessary to invoke Section \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  2808, the proclamation “declar[ed] that this emergency requires use of the Armed Forces.”  Id.; \n19  see also 10 U.S.C. § 2808(a) (limiting construction authority to presidential declarations “that \n20  require[] use of the armed forces”). \n21  As additional information regarding the national emergency declaration, the White House \n22  simultaneously issued a “fact sheet[],” which explained that “the Administration [had] so far \n23  identified up to $8.1 billion that will be available to build the border wall once a national \n24  emergency is declared.”  Citizen Groups RJN Ex. G.  The White House specifically identified \n25  three funding sources, purportedly to be used sequentially: \n26  •  “About $601 million from the Treasury Forfeiture Fund” (“TFF”); \n27  •  “Up to $2.5 billion under the Department of Defense funds transferred for Support for \n28  Counterdrug Activities” (10 U.S.C. § 284) (“Section 284”); and \n7 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 8 of 56\n \n1  •  “Up to $3.6 billion reallocated from Department of Defense military construction \n2  projects under the President’s declaration of a national emergency” (10 U.S.C. § 2808) \n3  (“Section 2808”). \n4  Id.   \n5  In declaring a national emergency, the President invoked his authority under the National \n6  Emergencies Act (“NEA”), Pub. L. 94–412, 90 Stat. 1255 (1976) (codified as amended at 50 \n7  U.S.C. §§ 1601–1651).  This appears to have been the first time in American history that a \n8  President declared a national emergency to secure funding previously withheld by Congress.  As \n9  another historical first, Congress passed a joint resolution to terminate the President’s declaration \n10  of a national emergency.  See H.R.J. Res. 46, 116th Cong. (2019).  The President vetoed \n11  Congress’s joint resolution on March 15, 2019.4  See Veto Message to the House of \n12  Representatives for H.J. Res. 46, The White House (Mar. 15, 2019), \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/veto-message-house-representatives-h-j-res-46/.  \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  The House voted 248-181 to override the President’s veto, which fell short of the required two-\ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  thirds majority.  165 Cong. Rec. 2,799, 2,814–15 (2019). \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Following the President’s national emergency declaration, executive officers reaffirmed \nS d nr\nee 17  what the President and his administration had been saying for months:  the Administration was \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  content to first request border barrier construction funding from Congress, and then augment \n19  whatever they received with funds from alternative sources.  Then-Secretary of Homeland \n20  Security Nielsen described this mindset on March 6, 2019, while testifying before the House \n21  Homeland Security Committee:  “[The President] hoped Congress would act, that it didn’t have to \n22  come to issuing an emergency declaration, if Congress had met his request to fund the resources \n23  that [U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”)] has requested.”  3/6/2019 Nielsen Testimony, \n24  C-SPAN (Mar. 6, 2019), https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4787939/362019-nielsen-testimony. \n25  Since the national emergency declaration, Defendants have taken significant steps toward \n26  using the funds at issue in this motion for border barrier construction.  On February 15, 2019, the \n27 \n                                                 \n4 As described below, the Congress that passed the NEA did not contemplate the possibility of a \n28 \npresidential veto. \n8 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 9 of 56\n \n1  Treasury approved a request from the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) to make \n2  available up to $601 million from the Treasury Forfeiture Fund, which Defendants “intend[] to \n3  obligate . . . before the end of Fiscal Year 2019.”  See Case No. 4:19-cv-00872-HSG, ECF No. 89-\n4  8 (“Flossman Second Decl.”) ¶¶ 9, 11.

See id. ¶ 10 (providing that construction “will begin no earlier than May 25, \n12  2019”). \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  To fund the Section 284 diversion, Defendant Shanahan simultaneously invoked Section \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  8005 of the most-recent DoD appropriations act to “reprogram” $1 billion from Army personnel \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  funds to the counter-narcotics support budget.

No. 115-245, § 8005, 132 Stat. 2981, 2999 (2018).  \nS d nr\nee 17  Defendant Shanahan also formally notified Congress of the authorization, explaining that \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  reprogrammed funds under Section 8005 were “required” so that DoD could provide DHS the \n19  support it requested under Section 284.  States RJN Ex. 32, at 1; see also id. Ex. 33, at 2 (DHS’s \n20  February 25, 2019 request for support under Section 284).   \n21  The next day, Defendant Shanahan appeared before the House Armed Services Committee \n22  to testify in support of the President’s budget request for fiscal year 2020.  See Case No. 4:19-cv-\n23  00872-HSG, ECF No. 89-12.  The Committee Chairman asked Defendant Shanahan why DoD did \n24  not first seek approval from relevant congressional committees before reprogramming funds under \n25  Section 8005, as would have been consistent with a “gentlemen’s agreement[]” between Congress \n26 \n                                                 \n27 \n5 Defendants have since elected not to fund or construct Yuma Project 2 using funds \nreprogrammed or diverted under Sections 8005 or 284.  See Dkt. No. 118-1 (“Rapuano Second \n28 \nDecl.”) ¶ 4. \n9 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 10 of 56\n \n1  and the Executive.  Id. at 13 (“But one of the sort of gentlemen’s agreements about [giving \n2  reprogramming authority for up to $4 billion last year] was if you reprogram money, you will not \n3  do it without first getting the approval of all for [sic] relevant committees . . . .  For the first time \n4  since we’ve [given such reprogramming authority] . . . . you are not asking for our permission.”).  \n5  The Chairman noted that “the result of” ignoring the gentlemen’s agreement likely would be \n6  Congress declining to provide such broad reprogramming authority in the future.  Id.  Defendant \n7  Shanahan conceded that “discretionary reprogramming” was “traditionally done in coordination” \n8  with Congress, but explained that the Administration discussed unilateral reprogramming “prior to \n9  the declaration of a national emergency,” recognized “the significant downsides of the [sic] losing \n10  what amounts to a privilege,” and nonetheless decided to move forward with unilaterally \n11  reprogramming funds despite that risk.  Id. at 14.  The same day as the hearing, both the House \n12  Committee on Armed Services and the House Committee on Appropriations formally disapproved \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  of the Section 8005 reprogramming.  See States RJN Ex. 35 (“The committee denies this request.  \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  The committee does not approve the proposed use of [DoD] funds to construct additional physical \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  barriers and roads or install lighting in the vicinity of the United States border.”); id. Ex. 36 (“The \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Committee has received and reviewed the requested reprogramming action . . . .  The Committee \nS d nr\nee 17  denies the request.”). \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  On April 24, 2019, Defendant McAleenan, the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security, \n19  published in the Federal Register notices of determination concerning the “construction of barriers \n20  and roads in the vicinity of the international land border in Luna County, New Mexico and Doña \n21  Ana County, New Mexico,” and “in Yuma County, Arizona”—in other words, areas encompassed \n22  by the El Paso Sector and Yuma Sector Projects.  See Determination Pursuant to Section 102 of \n23  the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, as Amended, 84 Fed. \n24  Reg. 17,185, 17,186 (Apr. 24, 2019); Determination Pursuant to Section 102 of the Illegal \n25  Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, as Amended, 84 Fed.

The Acting Secretary invoked his authority under Section 102(c) of the \n27 \n28 \n10 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 11 of 56\n \n1  Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (“IIRIRA”)6 “to waive all \n2  legal requirements that [he], in [his] sole discretion, determine[d] necessary to ensure the \n3  expeditious construction of barriers and roads authorized by section 102 of IIRIRA.”  See, e.g., 84 \n4  Fed. Reg. at 17,186.  The waiver asserts that “areas in the vicinity of the United States border, \n5  located in [these regions], are areas of high illegal entry,” for which “[t]here is presently an acute \n6  and immediate need to construct physical barriers and roads.”  See id.  The designated “Project \n7  Areas” encompass all portions of New Mexico and Arizona for which Defendants presently intend \n8  to construct physical barriers.  Finding this action “necessary,” the Acting Secretary invoked \n9  Section 102(c) to waive “in their entirety” numerous federal laws—including the National \n10  Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”), Pub. L. No. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 (1970) (codified as \n11  amended at 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321–4370b)—“with respect to the construction of physical barriers and \n12  roads . . . in the project area[s].”  See id. \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  On May 8, 2019, Defendant Shanahan, appearing before the Senate Defense \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  Appropriations Subcommittee, testified:  “We now have on contract sufficient funds to build about \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  256 miles of barrier,” explaining that this funding derived in part from “treasury forfeiture funds, \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  as well as reprogramming.”  Acting Defense Secretary Shanahan Testifies on 2020 Budget \nS d nr\nee 17  Request, C-SPAN (May 8, 2019), https://www.c-span.org/video/?460437-1/acting-defense-\nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  secretary-shanahan-testifies-2020-budget-request.

See Rapuano Second Decl. ¶ 6; see also \n3  Rapuano Decl. Ex. A, at 3, 6–7 (describing project locations).

STATUTORY FRAMEWORK \n2  A.  The National Emergencies Act \n3  In 1976, Congress enacted the National Emergencies Act “to insure that the exercise of \n4  national emergency authority is responsible, appropriate, and timely.”  Comm. on Gov’t \n5  Operations & the Special Comm. on Nat’l Emergencies & Delegated Emergency Powers, 94th \n6  Cong., 2d Sess., The National Emergencies Act (Public Law 94–412) Source Book: Legislative \n7  History, Texts, and Other Documents, at 1 (1976) (“NEA Source Book”).  The NEA rescinded \n8  several existing national emergencies, repealed many statutes, and created procedural guidelines \n9  for congressional oversight over future presidents’ declarations of national emergencies.   \n10  The NEA first permits that after “specifically declar[ing] a national emergency,” the \n11  president may exercise emergency powers authorized by Congress in other federal statutes.  50 \n12  U.S.C. § 1621.  To exercise any statutory emergency power, the president must first specify the \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  power or authority under which the president or other officers will act, “either in the declaration of \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  a national emergency, or by one or more contemporaneous or subsequent Executive orders \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.”  Id. § 1631.   \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Section 1622 then establishes a procedure for Congress to terminate any declared national \nS de nre 17  emergency through a joint resolution.8  As initially drafted, Congress meant for the joint resolution \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  to terminate the declared national emergency by itself—the NEA did not require a presidential \n19  signature on the joint resolution, nor was it subject to a presidential veto.  In part because \n20  Congress had power under the NEA to terminate national emergencies with a simple majority in \n21  both houses, Congress neither defined the term “national emergency,” nor “ma[de] any attempt to \n22  define when a declaration of national emergency is proper.”  NEA Source Book at 9, 278–92.  In \n23  rejecting a proposed amendment to the NEA that would have “spelled out” for the executive what \n24  may constitute a national emergency, the House of Representatives observed the “impossibility” \n25  of future presidents vetoing any joint resolution.  Id. at 279–80.  House members there observed: \n26 \n                                                 \n8 The initial version of the NEA referred to a “concurrent resolution.”  That language was changed \n27 \nto “joint resolution” in 1985.  See Foreign Relations Authorization Act, “22 USC 2651 note” \nFiscal Years 1986 and 1987, Pub. L. No. 99-93, § 801(1)(A), 99 Stat. 405, 448 (1985).  For \n28 \nsimplicity’s sake, the Court only uses the term “joint resolution,” as the statute now reads.  \n13 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 14 of 56\n \n \n1  Mr. Conyers. . . .  Mr. Chairman, my final participation in this debate \nrevolves around the reason of this question:  What happens if the \n2  President of the United States vetoes the congressional termination of \nthe emergency power?  Is that contemplatable within the purview of \n3  this legislation? \n \n4  . . . \n \n5  Mr. Flowers.  Mr. Chairman, on the advice of counsel we have \nresearched  that  thoroughly.    A  concurrent  resolution  would  not \n6  require  Presidential  signature  of  acceptance.    It  would  be  an \nimpossibility that it would be vetoed. \n7   \nMr. Conyers.  So there would be no way that the President could \n8  interfere with the Congress? \n \n9  Mr. Flowers.  The gentleman is correct. \n10  Id. \n11  Congress’s unilateral power under the NEA to terminate national emergency declarations \n12  ended in 1983, when the Supreme Court in INS v. Chadha ruled that the president must have \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  power to approve or veto congressional acts, such as a terminating joint resolution under the NEA.  \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  See 462 U.S. 919 (1983).  Two years later, Congress amended the NEA to reflect that the joint \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  resolution must be “enacted into law” to terminate an emergency, thereby rendering the NEA \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Chadha-compliant.  See Pub. L. No. 99-93, § 801(1)(A), 99 Stat. 405, 448 (1985).   \nS d nr\nee 17  By some estimates, there are 123 statutory powers available to a president who declares a \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  national emergency.  See A Guide to Emergency Powers and Their Use, Brennan Ctr. for Justice \n19  (2019), www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legislation/Emergency%20Powers_Printv2.pdf.  \n20  And in the more than forty years since Congress enacted the NEA, presidents have declared \n21  almost sixty national emergencies.  See Declared National Emergencies Under the National \n22  Emergencies Act, 1978-2018, Brennan Ctr. for Justice (2019), \n23  www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/analysis/NEA%20Declarations.pdf.  \n24  Until now, Congress had never invoked its emergency termination powers.  \n25  B.  Section 284 \n26  Under Section 284, “[t]he Secretary of Defense may provide support for the counterdrug \n27  activities . . . of any other department or agency of the Federal Government” if “such support is \n28  requested . . . by the official who has responsibility for [such] counterdrug activities.”  10 U.S.C. \n14 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 15 of 56\n \n1  § 284(a), (a)(1)(A).  Section 284 defines permissible “[t]ypes of support” under the statute, \n2  including support for “[c]onstruction of roads and fences and installation of lighting to block drug \n3  smuggling corridors across international boundaries of the United States.”  Id. § 284(b)(7).  The \n4  statute also mandates congressional notification before the Secretary of Defense provides \n5  certain—but not all—types of support.  Id. § 284(h).  For one, Section 284 requires the Secretary \n6  of Defense to submit to the appropriate congressional committee “a description of any small scale \n7  construction project for which support is provided.”  Id. § 284(h)(1)(B).  Section 284 defines \n8  “small scale construction” as “construction at a cost not to exceed $750,000 for any project.”  Id. \n9  § 284(i)(3). \n10  Congress first provided DoD with authority to support such counterdrug activities in 1991, \n11  in what is commonly referred to as “Section 1004.”  See National Defense Authorization Act for \n12  Fiscal Year 1991, Pub. L. No. 101-510, § 1004, 104 Stat. 1485, 1629–30 (1990).  The initial \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  iteration of Section 1004 made available $50 million in funds for fiscal year 1991 alone, and \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  contained no congressional notification requirement or per-project cap on the provision of support.  \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Id. § 1004(g), 104 Stat. at 1630.  Congress subsequently renewed Section 1004 on a regular basis.9  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Congress ultimately codified Section 1004 at 10 U.S.C. § 284 in 2016.  See National Defense \nS d nr\nee 17  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, Pub. L.

L. No. 115-245, div. A, tit. VI, 132 Stat. 2981, 2997 (2018).  All \n5  funds DoD now purports to make available for support to DHS under Section 284 come from the \n6  counter-narcotics support line of appropriation, out of what is known as the “drug interdiction \n7  fund.”  Rapuano Decl. ¶ 5, Ex. D.  But when Secretary Shanahan first authorized support to DHS \n8  under Section 284 on March 25, 2019, the counter-narcotics support line only contained \n9  $238,306,000 in unobligated funds.  See Dkt. No. 131 at 4 (citing Rapuano Decl. ¶ 5, Ex. D, at 2).  \n10  Therefore, although DoD seeks to make available $2.5 billion in support to DHS “under Section \n11  284,” Defendants have not used—and do not intend to use in the near future—any of the counter-\n12  narcotics support funds appropriated by Congress in fiscal year 2019 for border barrier \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  construction.  Id. (noting that all $2.5 billion in border barrier construction support to DHS under \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  Section 284 is attributable to Section 8005 and 9002 reprogramming).  In other words, every \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  dollar of Section 284 support to DHS and its enforcement agency, CBP, is attributable to \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  reprogramming mechanisms. \nS d nr\nee 17  DoD’s provision of support under Section 284 does not require a national emergency \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  declaration. \n19  C.  Section 8005 \n20  “An amount available under law may be withdrawn from one appropriation account and \n21  credited to another or to a working fund only when authorized by law.”  31 U.S.C. § 1532.  \n22  Section 8005 of the fiscal year 2019 Department of Defense Appropriations Act authorizes the \n23  Secretary of Defense to transfer up to $4 billion “of working capital funds of the Department of \n24  Defense or funds made available in this Act to the Department of Defense for military functions \n25  (except military construction).”  § 8005, 132 Stat. at 2999.  The Secretary must first determine that \n26  “such action is necessary in the national interest.”  Id.  Section 8005 further provides that such \n27  authority to transfer may only be used (1) for higher priority items than those for which originally \n28  appropriated, and (2) based on unforeseen military requirements, but (3) in no case where the item \n16 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 17 of 56\n \n1  for which funds are requested has been denied by the Congress.10  Id.   \n2  DoD’s Section 8005 transfer authority has existed in largely the same form since at least \n3  fiscal year 1974.  See Department of Defense Appropriation Act, 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-238, § 735, \n4  87 Stat. 1026, 1044 (1974).  That year, Congress added the “denied by Congress” provision “to \n5  tighten congressional control of the reprogramming process,” and in response to incidents where \n6  “[DoD] [had] requested that funds which have been specifically deleted in the legislative process \n7  be restored through the reprogramming process.”  H.R. Rep. No. 93-662, at 16 (1973).  The House \n8  Committee on Appropriations “believ[ed] that to concur in such actions would place committees \n9  in the position of undoing the work of the Congress,” and that “henceforth no such requests will \n10  be entertained.”  Id. \n11  On February 25, 2019, DHS submitted a request to DoD for assistance blocking drug-\n12  smuggling corridors under Section 284.  See Rapuano Decl. ¶ 3; States RJN Ex. 33.  And on \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  March 25, 2019, DoD invoked Section 8005 to transfer $1 billion from funds Congress previously \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  appropriated for military personnel costs to the drug interdiction fund, which DoD then intends to \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  use to provide DHS’s requested “assistance” by constructing border barriers using its Section 284 \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  authority.  See Rapuano Decl. ¶ 5, Ex. D.  Despite the recent dispute between the President and \nS d nr\nee 17  Congress over funding for border barrier construction, and although the President had directed \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  DoD nearly a year prior to support DHS “in securing the southern border and taking other \n19  necessary actions,” including the provision of “military personnel,” Federal Defendants purported \n20  to invoke Section 8005 “based on unforeseen military requirements.”  Id.; see also States RJN Ex. \n21  27 (April 4, 2018 presidential memorandum).  On May 9, 2019, Defendants invoked Section 8005 \n22  and a related reprogramming provision to authorize the transfer of an additional $1.5 billion in \n23  funding into the drug interdiction fund, which then is slated to be used under Section 284 for \n24  border barrier construction.  See Rapuano Second Decl. ¶¶ 6–7, Ex. C.   \n25  The reprogramming of funds under Section 8005 does not require a national emergency \n26  declaration. \n27 \n                                                 \n28 \n10 10 U.S.C. § 2214(b) contains identical transfer authority. \n17 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 18 of 56\n \n1  D.  Section 2808 \n2  Under Section 2808, the Secretary of Defense “may undertake military construction \n3  projects, and may authorize the Secretaries of the military departments to undertake military \n4  construction projects, not otherwise authorized by law.”  10 U.S.C. § 2808(a).  Section 2808 \n5  requires that the President first declare a national emergency under the NEA “that requires use of \n6  the armed forces.”  Id.  And the Secretary of Defense must use the funds for “military construction \n7  projects . . . that are necessary to support such use of the armed forces.”  Id. \n8  Congress defined the term “military construction” as it is used in Section 2808 to \n9  “include[] any construction, development, conversion, or extension of any kind carried out with \n10  respect to a military installation, whether to satisfy temporary or permanent requirements, or any \n11  acquisition of land or construction of a defense access road (as described in section 210 of title \n12  23).”  10 U.S.C. § 2801(a).  And Congress defined the term “military installation” to “mean[] a \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  base, camp, post, station, yard, center, or other activity under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of a \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  military department or, in the case of an activity in a foreign country, under the operational control \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  of the Secretary of a military department or the Secretary of Defense, without regard to the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  duration of operational control.”  Id. § 2801(c)(4). \nS d nr\nee 17  Presidents have twice invoked Section 2808’s military construction authority.  In 1990, \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  President George H.W. Bush authorized emergency construction authority “to deal with the threat \n19  to the national security and foreign policy of the United States caused by the invasion of Kuwait \n20  by Iraq.”  Exec. Order No. 12,734, 55 Fed. Reg, 48,099 (Nov. 14, 1990).  President George W. \n21  Bush later authorized emergency construction authority in the aftermath of the September 11, \n22  2001 terrorist attacks.  Exec. Order. No. 13,235, 66 Fed. Reg. 58,343 (Nov. 16, 2001).  To date, \n23  DoD has only once used its Section 2808 military construction authority domestically, when it \n24  authorized $35 million in funds to secure weapons of mass destruction in five states.  See Michael \n25  J. Vassalotti, Brendan W. McGarry, Military Construction Funding in the Event of a National \n26  Emergency, Cong. Research Serv. 2 & tbl. 1 (January 11, 2019). \n27  According to Defendants, the Acting Secretary of Defense “has not yet decided to \n28  undertake or authorize any barrier construction projects under section 2808.”  Rapuano Decl. ¶ 14.  \n18 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 19 of 56\n \n1  DoD undertook an internal review process, to identify “existing military construction projects of \n2  sufficient value to provide up to $3.6 billion of funding.”  Id. ¶ 15.  The review process identified \n3  such funding for border barrier construction, but the Acting Secretary nevertheless “has taken no \n4  action on this information and has not yet decided to undertake or authorize any barrier \n5  construction projects under section 2808.”  See Dkt. No. 131-2 (“Rapuano Third Decl.”) ¶ 6.  \n6  Defendants have represented that they “will inform the Court” once a decision is made to use \n7  Section 2808 to fund border barrier construction.  See Dkt. No. 131 at 3. \n8  E.  Treasury Forfeiture Fund (Section 9705) \n9  Through 31 U.S.C. § 9705, Congress established in the Treasury of the United States a \n10  separate fund known as the “Department of the Treasury Forfeiture Fund.”  31 U.S.C. § 9705(a).  \n11  Funds are generally available to the Secretary of the Treasury “with respect to seizures and \n12  forfeitures made pursuant to [applicable] law,” and for certain “law enforcement purposes.”  Id.  \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  State and local law enforcement agencies that participate in the seizure or forfeiture of property \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  may receive “[e]quitable sharing payments.”  Id. § 9705(a)(1)(G).  Section 9705(a)(1)(G) details \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  three statutory avenues for the provision of such equitable sharing payments:  “Equitable sharing \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  payments made to other Federal agencies, State and local law enforcement agencies, and foreign \nS d nr\nee 17  countries pursuant to section 616(c) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1616a(c)), section 981 of \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  title 18, or subsection (h) of this section, and all costs related thereto.”  Equitable sharing \n19  payments are statutorily capped, however, by the value of seized property.  31 U.S.C. \n20  § 9705(b)(2).  After the TFF has accounted for not only the current fiscal year’s mandatory \n21  expenses—which include equitable sharing payments—but also set aside adequate funds for the \n22  following fiscal year’s mandatory expenses, unobligated balances are available to the Secretary of \n23  the Treasury, to be used “in connection with the law enforcement activities of any Federal \n24  agency.”  31 U.S.C. § 9705(g)(4)(B).  This is commonly referred to as “Strategic Support.”  See \n25  Case No. 4:19-cv-00872-HSG, ECF No. 89-9 (“Farley Decl.”) ¶ 11. \n26  In late December 201811—during the government shutdown and just before the \n27 \n                                                 \n11 The exact date of the request is unclear due to Defendants’ inconsistent representations.  \n28 \nCompare Flossman Second Decl. ¶ 9 (indicating the request was made on December 26, 2018), \n19 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 20 of 56\n \n1  Administration sought $5.7 billion from Congress to fund border barrier construction—DHS \n2  requested $681 million in Strategic Support funding “for border security.”  Id. ¶ 24; see also States \n3  RJN Ex. 25 (January 6, 2019 request for $5.7 billion in funding for border barrier construction).  \n4  The Treasury ultimately determined that it could make available to CBP, DHS’s enforcement \n5  agency, up to $601 million from the TFF, in two tranches.  Farley Decl. ¶¶ 24–25; Opp. at 9.  The \n6  first tranche—$242 million—was made available for obligation on March 14, 2019.  See Opp. at \n7  9.  Save for a small portion “for program support on the TFF funded projects,” CBP intends to \n8  obligate the first tranche “on an Interagency Agreement (IAA) with the U.S. Army Corps of \n9  Engineers . . . by June 2019.”  Dkt. No. 131-1 (“Flossman Third Decl.”) ¶ 4.  Defendants represent \n10  that “CBP intends to obligate all available TFF funds before the end of Fiscal Year 2019 or, if not, \n11  before the end of the 2019 calendar year.”  Flossman Second Decl. ¶ 11.  The second tranche—\n12  $359 million—“is expected to be made available for obligation at a later date upon Treasury’s \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  receipt of additional anticipated forfeitures.”  See Opp. at 9.  CBP intends to use funds from the \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  TFF “exclusively for projects in the Rio Grande Valley Sector,” in Texas.  See Flossman Third \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Decl. ¶ 5. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  The Secretary of Treasury’s use of funds in the TFF for Strategic Support does not require \nS d nr\nee 17  a national emergency declaration. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  F.  National Environmental Policy Act \n19  NEPA establishes a “national policy which will encourage productive and enjoyable \n20  harmony between man and his environment[,] to promote efforts which will prevent or eliminate \n21  damage to the environment and biosphere and stimulate the health and welfare of man.”  42 \n22  U.S.C. § 4321.  To this end, NEPA compels federal agencies to assess the environmental impact \n23  of agency actions that “significantly affect[ ] the quality of the human environment.”  Id. \n24  § 4332(C).  NEPA  \n \n25  serves two fundamental objectives.  First, it “ensures that the agency, \nin  reaching  its  decision,  will  have  available,  and  will  carefully \n26  consider, detailed information concerning significant environmental \nimpacts.”  And, second, it requires “that the relevant information will \n27 \n                                                 \n28 \nwith Farley Decl. ¶ 24 (indicating the request was made on December 29, 2018). \n20 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 21 of 56\n \nbe made available to the larger audience that may also play a role in \n1  both  the decisionmaking process  and the implementation of that \ndecision.” \n2   \n3  WildEarth Guardians v. Provencio, No. 17-17373, 2019 WL 1983455, at *7 (9th Cir. May 6, \n4  2019) (quoting WildEarth Guardians v. Mont. Snowmobile Ass’n, 790 F.3d 920, 924 (9th Cir. \n5  2015)).  NEPA does not establish substantive environmental standards; rather, it sets “action-\n6  forcing” procedures that compel agencies to take a “hard look” at environmental consequences.  \n7  See Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 348–50 (1989).  “NEPA’s \n8  purpose is to ensure that ‘the agency will not act on incomplete information, only to regret its \n9  decision after it is too late to correct.’”  Friends of the Clearwater v. Dombeck, 222 F.3d 552, 557 \n10  (9th Cir. 2000) (quoting Marsh v. Or. Nat. Res. Council, 490 U.S. 360, 371 (1989)).  And the \n11  Ninth Circuit commands that courts “strictly interpret” NEPA’s procedural requirements “to the \n12  fullest extent possible,” as consistent with NEPA’s policies.  Churchill Cty. v. Norton, 276 F.3d \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  1060, 1072 (9th Cir. 2001) (quoting Lathan v. Brinegar, 506 F.2d 677, 687 (9th Cir. 1974) (en \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  banc)).  “[G]rudging, pro forma compliance will not do.” Id. (quoting Lathan, 506 F.2d at 693). \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Where an agency’s project “might significantly affect environmental quality,” NEPA \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  compels preparation of what is known as an Environmental Impact Statement (“EIS”).  Provencio, \nS d nr\nee 17  2019 WL 1983455, at *7 (emphasis added).  To prevail on a claim that an agency violated its duty \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  to prepare an EIS, a plaintiff need only raise “substantial questions whether a project may have a \n19  significant [environmental] effect.”  Id. (quoting Blue Mountains Biodiversity Project v. \n20  Blackwood, 161 F.3d 1208, 1212 (9th Cir. 1998)).  An action’s “significance” depends on “both \n21  context and intensity.”  40 C.F.R. § 1508.27; see also id. § 1508.27(b) (setting forth ten factors to \n22  “consider[] in evaluating intensity”).  Even where a project does not require an EIS, agencies \n23  generally must prepare an Environmental Assessment (“EA”) which, in part, serves to “[b]riefly \n24  provide sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an environmental \n25  impact statement or a finding of no significant impact.”  See 40 C.F.R. § 1508.9(a)(1).   \n26  “[A]gency action taken without observance of the procedure required by law will be set \n27  aside.”  Save the Yaak Comm. v. Block, 840 F.2d 714, 717 (9th Cir. 1988). \n28  // \n21 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 22 of 56\n \n1  III.  LEGAL STANDARD \n2  A preliminary injunction is a matter of equitable discretion and is “an extraordinary \n3  remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.” \n4  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008).  “A plaintiff seeking preliminary \n5  injunctive relief must establish that [it] is likely to succeed on the merits, that [it] is likely to suffer \n6  irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in [its] favor, \n7  and that an injunction is in the public interest.”  Id. at 20.  Alternatively, an injunction may issue \n8  where “the likelihood of success is such that serious questions going to the merits were raised and \n9  the balance of hardships tips sharply in [the plaintiff’s] favor,” provided that the plaintiff can also \n10  demonstrate the other two Winter factors.  All. for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, \n11  1131–32 (9th Cir. 2011) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  Under either standard, \n12  Plaintiffs bear the burden of making a clear showing that they are entitled to this extraordinary \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  remedy.  Earth Island Inst. v. Carlton, 626 F.3d 462, 469 (9th Cir. 2010).  The most important \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  Winter factor is likelihood of success on the merits.  See Disney Enters., Inc. v. VidAngel, Inc., 869 \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  F.3d 848, 856 (9th Cir. 2017).   \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  IV.  ANALYSIS \nS d nr\nee 17  In the pending motion, Plaintiffs seek to enjoin Defendants from using certain diverted \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  federal funds and resources for border barrier construction.  Specifically, Plaintiffs move to enjoin \n19  Defendants from (1) invoking Section 8005’s reprogramming authority to channel funds into \n20  DoD’s drug interdiction fund, (2) invoking Section 284 to divert monies from DoD’s drug \n21  interdiction fund for border barrier construction on the southern border of Arizona and New \n22  Mexico, (3) invoking Section 2808 to divert monies from appropriated DoD military construction \n23  projects for border barrier construction,12 and (4) taking any further action related to border barrier \n24  construction until Defendants comply with NEPA. \n25  Defendants oppose each basis for injunctive relief.  Defendants further contend that the \n26  Plaintiffs lack standing to bring their Sections 8005 and 2808 claims.  The Court addresses these \n27 \n                                                 \n28 \n12 Only the Citizen Group Plaintiffs challenge the diversion of funds under Section 2808. \n22 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 23 of 56\n \n1  threshold issues first before turning to Plaintiffs’ individual bases for injunctive relief. \n2  A.  Article III Standing \n3  A plaintiff seeking relief in federal court bears the burden of establishing “the irreducible \n4  constitutional minimum” of standing.  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016) \n5  (quoting Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992)).  First, the plaintiff must have \n6  “suffered an injury in fact.”  Id.  This requires “an invasion of a legally protected interest” that is \n7  concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent, rather than conjectural or hypothetical.  Lujan, \n8  504 U.S. at 560 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Second, the plaintiff’s injury must be “fairly \n9  traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant.”  Spokeo, 136 S. Ct. at 1547.  Third, the \n10  injury must be “likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.”  Id. (citing Lujan, 504 U.S. \n11  at 560–61). \na  12  1.  Plaintiffs Have Standing for Their 8005 Claim. \ntr in\nuoro 13  Defendants argue that Plaintiffs lack standing to challenge Defendants’ invocation of \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  Section 8005 to reprogram funds into the drug interdiction fund, so that Defendants can then \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  divert that money wholesale to border barrier construction using Section 284.  See Opp. at 14.13  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Defendants do not dispute that Plaintiffs have standing to challenge the use of funds from the drug \nS d nr\nee 17  interdiction fund for border barrier construction under Section 284.  Defendants nonetheless \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  reason that harm from construction using drug interdiction funds under Section 284 does not \n19  establish standing to challenge Defendants’ use of Section 8005 to supply those funds.  Id.  \n20  Defendants argue that standing requires that the plaintiff be the “object” of the challenged agency \n21  action, but that the Section 8005 augmentation of the drug interdiction fund and the use of that \n22  money for construction are two distinct agency actions.  Id. (citing Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562).  \n23  According to Defendants, the “object” of the Section 8005 reprogramming was “simply mov[ing] \n24  funds among DoD’s accounts.”  Id. (citing Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562). \n25  Defendants’ logic fails in all respects.  As an initial matter, it is not credible to suggest that \n26 \n                                                 \n13 Defendants also argue Plaintiffs lack standing because they fall outside Section 8005’s “zone of \n27 \ninterests.”  See Opp. at 18–19.  Because the Court finds Defendants’ “zone of interests” challenge \nderivative of Defendants’ misunderstanding of ultra vires review, the Court addresses those \n28 \nmatters together, below.  See infra Section IV.B.1. \n23 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 24 of 56\n \n1  the “object” of the Section 8005 reprogramming is anything but border barrier construction, even \n2  if the reprogrammed funds make a pit stop in the drug interdiction fund.  Since Defendants first \n3  announced that they would reprogram funds using Section 8005, they have uniformly described \n4  the object of that reprogramming as border barrier construction.  See Rapuano Decl. ¶ 5 (providing \n5  that “the Acting Secretary of Defense decided to use DoD’s general transfer authority under \n6  section 8005 . . . to transfer funds between DoD appropriations to fund [border barrier \n7  construction in Arizona and New Mexico]”); id. Ex. D, at 1 (notifying Congress that the \n8  “reprogramming action” under Section 8005 is for “construction of additional physical barriers \n9  and roads in the vicinity of the United States border”).   \n10  Nor does Lujan impose Defendants’ proffered strict “object” test.  The Lujan Court \n11  explained that “when the plaintiff is not himself the object of the government action or inaction he \n12  challenges, standing is not precluded, but it is ordinarily substantially more difficult to establish.”  \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  504 U.S. at 562 (internal quotation marks omitted).  And the Supreme Court was concerned in \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  particular with “causation and redressability,” which are complicated inquiries when a plaintiff’s \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  standing “depends on the unfettered choices made by independent actors not before the courts and \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  whose exercise of broad and legitimate discretion the courts cannot presume either to control or to \nS d nr\nee 17  predict.”  Id. (quoting ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U.S. 605, 615 (1989) (Kennedy, J.)).  As \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  concerns causation, the Ninth Circuit recently explained that Article III standing only demands a \n19  showing that the plaintiff’s injury is “fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant, and \n20  not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.”  Mendia v. \n21  Garcia, 768 F.3d 1009, 1012 (9th Cir. 2014) (quoting Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 167 \n22  (1997)).  “Causation may be found even if there are multiple links in the chain connecting the \n23  defendant’s unlawful conduct to the plaintiff’s injury, and there’s no requirement that the \n24  defendant’s conduct comprise the last link in the chain.  As we’ve said before, what matters is not \n25  the length of the chain of causation, but rather the plausibility of the links that comprise the \n26  chain.”  Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \n27  No complicated causation inquiry is necessary here, as there are no independent absent \n28  actors.  More important, if there were ever a case where standing exists even though the \n24 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 25 of 56\n \n1  challenged government action is nominally directed to some different “object,” this is it.  Neither \n2  the parties nor the Court harbor any illusions that the point of reprogramming funds under Section \n3  8005 is to use those funds for border barrier construction.  And under Ninth Circuit law, there is \n4  no requirement that the challenged conduct be the last link in the causal chain.  Rather, even if \n5  there is an intervening link between the Section 8005 reprogramming and the border barrier \n6  construction itself, any injury caused by the border barrier construction is nonetheless “fairly \n7  traceable” to the Section 8005 reprogramming under the circumstances.  See id.  The Court thus \n8  cannot accept the Government’s “two distinct actions” rationale as a basis for shielding \n9  Defendants’ actions from review. \n10  2.  Plaintiffs Have Standing for Their Section 2808 Claim. \n11  Defendants argue that Plaintiffs lack standing to challenge Defendants’ diversion of funds \n12  under Section 2808 “because the Acting Secretary of Defense has not yet decided to undertake or \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  authorize any barrier construction projects under [Section] 2808.”  Opp. at 21.  Defendants \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  describe the status of the Section 2808 diversion as follows: \ni\nrts fo  \niD tc 15  The Acting Secretary of Defense has not yet decided to undertake or \n sir\net authorize any barrier construction projects under section 2808.  To \ntatsiD 16  inform  the Acting Secretary’s decision, on March 20, 2019, the \nS d nr Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  provided  a  prioritized  list  of \nee 17  proposed  border-barrier-construction  projects  that  DHS  assesses \nth\nintr would improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the armed forces \nUo\nN 18  supporting OHS in securing the southern border.  On April 11, 2019, \nas a follow-up to the Chairman’s preliminary assessment of February \n19  10, 2019, the Acting Secretary instructed the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff to provide, by May 10, 2019, a detailed assessment of \n20  whether and how specific military construction projects could support \nthe use of the armed forces in addressing the national emergency at \n21  the southern border. \n \n22  Also on April 11, 2019, the Acting Secretary instructed the DoD \nComptroller,  in  consultation  with  the  Secretaries  of  the  military \n23  departments, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Under \nSecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, the Under \n24  Secretary of Defense for Policy, and the heads of any other relevant \nDoD components to identify, by May 10, 2019, existing military \n25  construction projects of sufficient value to provide up to $3.6 billion \nof funding for his consideration. \n26   \n27  Rapuano Decl. ¶¶ 14–15.  According to Defendants, absent some express decision to authorize or \n28  undertake a particular project, Plaintiffs’ injury is speculative:  “It is entirely possible that no \n25 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 26 of 56\n \n1  barrier projects will be constructed pursuant to [Section] 2808, and that, if they are, they will be \n2  [sic] built in any location where Plaintiffs would have a claim to a cognizable injury.”  Opp. at 21. \n3  Defendants ask too much of Plaintiffs.  A plaintiff need not present undisputable proof of a \n4  future harm.  The injury-in-fact requirement instead permits standing when a risk of future injury \n5  is “at least imminent.”  See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 564 n.2.  And while courts must ensure that the \n6  “actual or imminent” measure of harm is not “stretched beyond its purpose, which is to ensure that \n7  the alleged injury is not too speculative for Article III purposes,” see id., the Ninth Circuit has \n8  consistently held that a “‘credible threat’ that a probabilistic harm will materialize” is enough, see \n9  Nat. Res. Def. Council v. EPA, 735 F.3d 873, 878 (9th Cir. 2013) (quoting Covington v. Jefferson \n10  Cty., 358 F.3d 626, 641 (9th Cir. 2004)). \n11  At this stage, Plaintiffs have carried their burden to demonstrate that there is a “credible \n12  threat” that Defendants will divert funds under Section 2808 for border barrier construction in a \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  location where Plaintiffs would have a claim to a cognizable injury.  As detailed in Defendants’ \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  supporting declaration, a decision on the use of Section 2808 to authorize border barrier \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  construction is forthcoming, as the DoD has now received necessary information which it intends \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  to use to make decisions.  See Rapuano Third Decl. ¶ 6.  Further, the Court cannot ignore that the \nS d nr\nee 17  President invoked Section 2808 to enable the diversion of funds for border barrier construction.  \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  See Citizen Groups RJN Ex. D.  The White House in fact provided in February 2019 that funds \n19  under Section 2808 “will be available.”  Id. Ex. G.  There is thus no speculation necessary for the \n20  Court to find that Defendants will continue with their current course of conduct and exercise their \n21  authority under Section 2808 in the manner directed by the President.  See Cent. Delta Water \n22  Agency v. United States, 306 F.3d 938, 950 (9th Cir. 2002) (“Although [Nelsen v. King County, \n23  895 F.2d 1248, 1251–52 (9th Cir. 1990)] certainly requires us to consider all the circumstances \n24  related to a threatened future harm, including whether the threatened harm may result from a chain \n25  of contingencies, the possibility that defendants may change their course of conduct is not the type \n26  of contingency to which we referred in Nelsen.”). \n27  Finally, as to Defendants’ claim that they might use Section 2808 funds in a location where \n28  Plaintiffs would not have a claim to a cognizable injury, it is highly unlikely that this would be the \n26 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 27 of 56\n \n1  case, as Plaintiffs have demonstrated that their members span the entire U.S.-Mexico border.  See, \n2  e.g., Dkt. No. 32 ¶ 3 (“SBCC’s membership spans the borderlands from California to Texas.”).   \n3  B.  Plaintiffs Have Shown They Are Entitled to a Preliminary Injunction. \n4  Applying the Winter factors, the Court finds Plaintiffs are entitled to a preliminary \n5  injunction as to Defendants’ use of Section 8005’s reprogramming authority to channel funds into \n6  the drug interdiction fund so that those funds may be ultimately used for border barrier \n7  construction in El Paso Sector Project 1 and Yuma Sector Project 1. \n8  1.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \n9  The crux of Plaintiffs’ case is that Defendants’ methods for funding border barrier \n10  construction are unlawful.  And Plaintiffs package that core challenge in several ways.  For \n11  present purposes, Plaintiffs contend that Defendants’ actions (1) violate Congress’s most-recent \n12  appropriations legislation, (2) are unconstitutional, (3) exceed Defendants’ statutory authority—in \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  other words, are ultra vires—and (4) violate NEPA.  \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  The Court begins with a discussion of the law governing the appropriation of federal funds.  \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Under the Appropriations Clause of the Constitution, “No Money shall be drawn from the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.”  U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 7.  \nS d nr\nee 17  “The Clause’s words convey a ‘straightforward and explicit command’:  No money ‘can be paid \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  out of the Treasury unless it has been appropriated by an act of Congress.’”  U.S. Dep’t of Navy v. \n19  FLRA, 665 F.3d 1339, 1346 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (quoting OPM v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414, 424 \n20  (1990)).  “The Clause has a ‘fundamental and comprehensive purpose . . . to assure that public \n21  funds will be spent according to the letter of the difficult judgments reached by Congress as to the \n22  common good and not according to the individual favor of Government agents.’”  United States v. \n23  McIntosh, 833 F.3d 1163, 1175 (9th Cir. 2016) (quoting Richmond, 496 U.S. at 427–28).  It \n24  “protects Congress’s exclusive power over the federal purse,” and “prevents Executive Branch \n25  officers from even inadvertently obligating the Government to pay money without statutory \n26  authority.”  FLRA, 665 F.3d at 1346–47 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).   \n27  “Federal statutes reinforce Congress’s control over appropriated funds,” and under federal \n28  law “appropriated funds may be applied only ‘to the objects for which the appropriations were \n27 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 28 of 56\n \n1  made.’”  Id. at 1347 (quoting 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a)).  Moreover, “[a]n amount available under law \n2  may be withdrawn from one appropriation account and credited to another or to a working fund \n3  only when authorized by law.”  31 U.S.C. § 1532.  “[A]ll uses of appropriated funds must be \n4  affirmatively approved by Congress,” and “the mere absence of a prohibition is not sufficient.”  \n5  FLRA, 665 F.3d at 1348.  In summary, “Congress’s control over federal expenditures is \n6  ‘absolute.’”  Id. (quoting Rochester Pure Waters Dist. v. EPA, 960 F.2d 180, 185 (D.C. Cir. \n7  1992)). \n8  Rather than dispute these principles, Defendants contend that the challenged conduct \n9  complies with them.  See Opp. at 26 (“The Government is not relying on independent Article II \n10  authority to undertake border construction; rather, the actions alleged are being undertaken \n11  pursuant to express statutory authority.”).  Accordingly, one of the key issues in dispute is whether \n12  Congress in fact provided “express statutory authority” for Defendants’ challenged actions.  \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Turning to Plaintiffs’ claims, it is necessary as a preliminary matter to outline the measure \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  and lens of reviewability the Court applies in assessing such broad challenges to actions by \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  executive officers.  As a first principle, the Court finds that it has authority to review each of \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Plaintiffs’ challenges to executive action.  “It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial \nS d nr\nee 17  department to say what the law is.”  Marbury, 1 Cranch at 177.  In determining what the law is, \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  the Court has a duty to determine whether executive officers invoking statutory authority exceed \n19  their statutory power.  See Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 135 S. Ct. 1378, 1384 \n20  (2015).  And even where executive officers act in conformance with statutory authority, the Court \n21  has an independent duty to determine whether authority conferred by act of the legislature \n22  nevertheless runs afoul of the Constitution.  See Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 448 \n23  (1998).  \n24  Once a case or controversy is properly before a court, in most instances that court may \n25  grant injunctive relief against executive officers to enjoin both ultra vires acts—that is, acts \n26  exceeding the officers’ purported statutory authority—and unconstitutional acts.  The Supreme \n27  Court recently reaffirmed this core equitable power: \n \n28  It is true enough that we have long held that federal courts may in \n28 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 29 of 56\n \nsome circumstances grant injunctive relief against state officers who \n1  are violating, or planning to violate, federal law.  But that has been \ntrue  not  only  with  respect  to  violations  of  federal  law  by  state \n2  officials, but also with respect to violations of federal law by federal \nofficials. . . .  What our cases demonstrate is that, in a proper case, \n3  relief may be given in a court of equity . . .  to prevent an injurious act \nby a public officer. \n4   \nThe ability to sue to enjoin unconstitutional actions by state and \n5  federal officers is the creation of courts of equity, and reflects a long \nhistory of judicial review of illegal executive action, tracing back to \n6  England. \n7  Armstrong, 135 S. Ct. at 1384 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \n8  Misunderstanding the presumptive availability of equitable relief to enforce federal law, \n9  Defendants contend that Plaintiffs fail to identify a statutory private right of action, that Plaintiffs \n10  must challenge Defendants’ conduct through the framework of the APA, and that to the extent \n11  ultra vires review is available, “Plaintiffs [must] show that the challenged action ‘contravene[s] \n12  clear and mandatory statutory language.’”  See Opp. at 12–13.  But as Plaintiffs detail at length in \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  their reply brief, ultra vires review exists outside of the APA framework, and Defendants’ \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  heightened standard for ultra vires review only applies where Congress has foreclosed judicial \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  review, which is not the case here.  See Reply at 2–5; see also Dkt. No. 107 (Brief of Amici Curiae \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Federal Courts Scholars).14 \nS d nr\nee 17  Due to their mistaken framing of the scope of ultra vires review, Defendants also \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  incorrectly posit that Plaintiffs must establish that they fall within the “zone of interests” of a \n19  particular statute to challenge actions taken by the government under that statute.  See Opp. at 14–\n20  15.  The “zone of interests” test, however, only relates to statutorily-created causes of action.  See \n21  Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 129 (2014) (explaining that \n22  “[t]he modern ‘zone of interests’ formulation . . . . applies to all statutorily created causes of \n23  action”).  The test has no application in an ultra vires challenge, which operates outside of the \n24 \n                                                 \n25 \n14 Congress may displace federal courts’ equitable power to enjoin unlawful executive action, but \na precluding statute must at least display an “intent to foreclose” injunctive relief.  Armstrong, 135 \n26 \nS. Ct. at 1385.  Courts have found such implied foreclosure where (1) the statute provides an \nexpress administrative remedy, and (2) the statute is otherwise judicially unadministrable in \n27 \nnature.  Id. at 1385–86.  No party contends that the statutes at issue in this case either expressly \nforeclose equitable relief or provide an express administrative remedy, which might warrant a \n28 \nfinding of implied foreclosure of equitable relief. \n29 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 30 of 56\n \n1  APA framework.  See Haitian Refugee Ctr. v. Gracey, 809 F.2d 794, 811 n.14 (D.C. Cir. 1987) \n2  (“Appellants need not, however, show that their interests fall within the zones of interests of the \n3  constitutional and statutory powers invoked by the President in order to establish their standing to \n4  challenge the interdiction program as ultra vires.”); see also 33 Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal \n5  Practice and Procedure § 8302 (2d ed. 2019) (explaining that the “zone of interests” test is to \n6  determine whether a plaintiff “seeks to protect interests that ‘arguably’ fall within the ‘zone of \n7  interests’ protected by that provision”).  In other words, where a plaintiff seeks to vindicate a right \n8  protected by a statutory provision, the plaintiff must demonstrate that it arguably falls within the \n9  zone of interests Congress meant to protect by enacting that provision.  But where a plaintiff seeks \n10  equitable relief against a defendant for exceeding its statutory authority, the zone-of-interests test \n11  is inapposite.  Any other interpretation would lead to absurd results.  The very nature of an ultra \n12  vires action posits that an executive officer has gone beyond what the statute permits, and thus \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  beyond what Congress contemplated.  It would not make sense to demand that Plaintiffs—who \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  otherwise have standing—establish that Congress contemplated that the statutes allegedly violated \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  would protect Plaintiffs’ interests.  It is no surprise, then, that the Supreme Court’s recent \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  discussion of ultra vires review in Armstrong did not once reference this test.  \nS d nr\nee 17  In reviewing the lawfulness of Defendants’ conduct, the Court thus begins each inquiry by \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  determining whether the disputed action exceeds statutory authority.  For unless an animating \n19  statute sanctions a challenged action, a court need not reach the second-level question of whether \n20  it would be unconstitutional for Congress to sanction such conduct.  See Nw. Austin Mun. Util. \n21  Dist. No. One v. Holder, 557 U.S. 193, 205 (2009) (explaining the “well-established principle \n22  governing the prudent exercise of this Court’s jurisdiction that normally the Court will not decide \n23  a constitutional question if there is some other ground upon which to dispose of the case”) \n24  (quoting Escambia Cty. v. McMillan, 466 U.S. 48, 51 (1984) (per curiam)).  This is not to say, \n25  however, that the yardstick of statutory authority overlooks constitutional concerns entirely.  “The \n26  so-called canon of constitutional avoidance . . . counsel[s] that ambiguous statutory language be \n27  construed to avoid serious constitutional doubts.”  FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. \n28  502, 516 (2009).  Nonetheless, a court presented with both ultra vires and constitutional claims \n30 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 31 of 56\n \n1  should begin by determining whether the statutory authority supports the action challenged, and \n2  only reach the constitutional analysis if necessary. \n3  a.  Sections 284 and 8005 \n4  At the President’s direction, Defendants intend to divert $2.5 billion, $1 billion of which is \n5  the subject of the pending motion, to the DoD’s drug interdiction fund for border barrier \n6  construction.15  To do so, Defendants rely on Section 284(b)(7), which authorizes the Secretary of \n7  Defense to support other federal agencies for the “[c]onstruction of roads and fences and \n8  installation of lighting to block drug smuggling corridors across international boundaries of the \n9  United States.”  See The Funds Available to Address the National Emergency at Our Border, The \n10  White House, https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/funds-available-address-national-\n11  emergency-border (Feb. 26, 2019).  To satisfy the President’s directive, Defendants intend to rely \n12  on their reprogramming authority under Section 8005, and plan to “augment” the drug interdiction \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  fund with the entire $2.5 billion in funds that DoD will then use for the construction.  Id.   \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  Plaintiffs challenge both the augmentation of the drug interdiction fund through Section \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  8005 and the use of funds from the drug interdiction fund under Section 284.  Turning first to the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  augmentation of funds, Section 8005 authorizes the reprogramming of up to $4 billion “of \nS d nr\nee 17  working capital funds of the Department of Defense or funds made available in this Act to the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Department of Defense.”  The transfer must be (1) either (a) DoD working capital funds or (b) \n19  “funds made available in this Act to the [DoD] for military functions (except military \n20  construction),” (2) first determined by the Secretary of Defense as necessary in the national \n21  interest, (3) for higher priority items than those for which originally appropriated, (4) based on \n22  unforeseen (5) military requirements, and (6) in no case where the item for which funds are \n23 \n                                                 \n15 The Court here only considers the lawfulness of Defendants’ March 25, 2019 invocation of \n24 \nSection 8005 to reprogram $1 billion, given the parties’ agreement that this order need not address \nDefendants’ recently announced intent to use Sections 8005, 9002, and 284 to fund border barrier \n25 \nconstruction in the El Centro Sector and Tucson Sector Projects.  The parties reached this \nagreement after counsel for Defendants represented at the hearing on this motion that “no \n26 \nconstruction will start [with those funds] until at least 45 days from” the May 17, 2019 hearing \ndate.  See Dkt. No. 138 at 55:16–17.  The parties confirmed that they would agree to a schedule to \n27 \nsupplement the record, to permit the Court to review in a timely manner the lawfulness of the new \nreprogramming, under the framework set forth in this order.  Id. at 59:14–60:2.  The parties have \n28 \nsince agreed on a schedule.  See Dkt. No. 142.  \n31 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 32 of 56\n \n1  requested has been denied by Congress.  Plaintiffs argue that Defendants’ actions fail the last three \n2  requirements.  The Court first considers whether the reprogramming Defendants propose here is \n3  for an item for which funds were requested but denied by Congress. \n4  i.  Plaintiffs are Likely to Show That the Item for Which \nFunds Are Requested Has Been Denied by Congress. \n5   \n6  Plaintiffs argue that Defendants are transferring funds for a purpose previously denied by \n7  Congress.  Mot. at 16.  Defendants dispute, however, whether Congress’s affirmative \n8  appropriation of funds in the CAA to DHS constitutes a “denial” of appropriations to DoD’s \n9  “counter-drug activities in furtherance of DoD’s mission under [Section] 284.”  Opp. at 16.  In \n10  their view, “the item” for which funds are requested, for present purposes, is counterdrug activities \n11  under Section 284.  Id.  And Defendants maintain that “nothing in the DHS appropriations statute \n12  indicates that Congress ‘denied’ a request to fund DoD’s statutorily authorized counter-drug \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  activities, which expressly include fence construction.”  Id.  In other words, even though DoD’s \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  counterdrug authority under Section 284 is merely a pass-through vessel for Defendants to funnel \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  money to construct a border barrier that will be turned over to DHS, Citizen Groups RJN Ex. I, at \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  10, Defendants argue that the Court should only consider whether Congress denied funding to \nS d nr\nee 17  DoD. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success as to their argument that Congress previously \n19  denied “the item for which funds are requested,” precluding the proposed transfer.  On January 6, \n20  2019, the President asked Congress for “$5.7 billion for construction of a steel barrier for the \n21  Southwest border,” explaining that the request “would fund construction of a total of \n22  approximately 234 miles of new physical barrier.”  Citizen Groups RJN Ex. A, at 1.  The request \n23  noted that “[a]ppropriations bills for fiscal year (FY) 2019 that have already been considered by \n24  the current and previous Congresses are inadequate to fully address these critical issues,” to \n25  include the need for barrier construction funds.  Id.  The President’s request did not specify the \n26  mechanics of how the $5.7 billion sought would be used for the proposed steel barrier \n27  construction.  Id.  Nonetheless, in the CAA passed by Congress and signed by the President, \n28  Congress appropriated only $1.375 billion for the construction of pedestrian fencing, of a specified \n32 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 33 of 56\n \n1  type, in a specified sector, and appropriated no other funds for barrier construction.  The Court \n2  agrees with Plaintiffs that they are likely to show that the proposed transfer is for an item for \n3  which Congress denied funding, and that it thus runs afoul of the plain language of Section 8005 \n4  and 10 U.S.C. § 2214(b) (“Section 2214”).16  \n5  As Defendants acknowledge, in interpreting a statute, the Court applies the principle that \n6  “the plain language of [the statute] should be enforced according to its terms, in light of its \n7  context.”  ASARCO, LLC v. Celanese Chem. Co., 792 F.3d 1203, 1210 (9th Cir. 2015).  In its \n8  amicus brief, the House recounts legislative history that provides critical context for the Court’s \n9  interpretative task.  The House explains that the “denied by the Congress” restriction was imposed \n10  on DoD’s transfer authority in 1974 to “tighten congressional control of the reprogramming \n11  process.”  Dkt. No. 47 (“House Br.”) at 10 (citing H.R. Rep. No. 93-662, at 16 (1973)).  The \n12  House committee report on the appropriations bill from that year explained that “[n]ot frequently, \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  but on some occasions, the Department ha[d] requested that funds which have been specifically \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  deleted in the legislative process be restored through the reprogramming process,” and that “[t]he \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Committee believe[d] that to concur in such actions would place committees in the position of \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  undoing the work of the Congress.”  H.R. Rep. No. 93-662, at 16.  Significantly, the Committee \nS d nr\nee 17  stated that such a position would be “untenable.”  Id.  Consistent with this purpose, Congress has \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  described its intent that appropriations restrictions of this sort be “construed strictly” to “prevent \n19  the funding for programs which have been considered by Congress and for which funding has \n20  been denied.”  See H.R. Rep. No. 99-106, at 9 (1985) (discussing analogous appropriations \n21  restriction in Pub. L. No. 99-169, § 502(b), 99 Stat. 1005 (codified at 50 U.S.C. § 3094(b)).   \n22  The Court finds that the language and purpose of Section 8005 and Section 2214(b) likely \n23  preclude Defendants’ attempt to transfer $1 billion from funds Congress previously appropriated \n24  for military personnel costs to the drug interdiction fund for the construction of a border barrier.  \n25 \n                                                 \n26 \n16 See Fox News, Mick Mulvaney on chances of border deal, Democrats ramping up investigation \nof Trump admin, YouTube (Feb. 10, 2019), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_Z0xx_zS0M  \n27 \n(statement by Acting White House Chief of Staff that “[w]e’ll take as much money as you can \ngive us, and then we’ll go off and find the money someplace else, legally, in order to secure that \n28 \nsouthern barrier.  But this is going to get built, with or without Congress.”).   \n33 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 34 of 56\n \n1  Defendants argue that “Congress never denied DoD funding to undertake the [Section] 284 \n2  projects at issue,” Opp. at 16, such that Section 8005 and Section 2214(b) are satisfied.  But in the \n3  Court’s view, that reading of those sections is likely wrong, when the reality is that Congress was \n4  presented with—and declined to grant—a $5.7 billion request for border barrier construction.  \n5  Border barrier construction, expressly, is the item Defendants now seek to fund via the Section \n6  8005 transfer, and Congress denied the requested funds for that item.  See 10 U.S.C. § 2214(b) \n7  (explaining that transfer authority “may not be used if the item to which the funds would be \n8  transferred is an item for which Congress has denied funds”) (emphasis added).  And Defendants \n9  point to nothing in the language or legislative history of the statutes in support of their assertion \n10  that only explicit congressional denial of funding for “[Section] 284 projects,” or even DoD \n11  projects generally, would trigger Section 8005’s limitation.  Opp. at 16.  It thus would be \n12  inconsistent with the purpose of these provisions, and would subvert “the difficult judgments \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  reached by Congress,” McIntosh, 833 F.3d at 1175, to allow Defendants to circumvent Congress’s \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  clear decision to deny the border barrier funding sought here when it appropriated a dramatically \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  lower amount in the CAA.  See Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 609 \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  (1952) (Frankfurter, J., concurring) (“It is quite impossible . . . when Congress did specifically \nS d nr\nee 17  address itself to a problem . . . to find secreted in the interstices of legislation the very grant of \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  power which Congress consciously withheld.  To find authority so explicitly withheld is not \n19  merely to disregard in a particular instance the clear will of Congress.  It is to disrespect the whole \n20  legislative process and the constitutional division of authority between President and Congress.”). \n21  ii.  Plaintiffs are Likely to Show That the Transfer is Not \nBased on “Unforeseen Military Requirements.” \n22   \n23  Plaintiffs next argue that any need for border barrier construction—to the extent there is a \n24  need—was long “foreseen,” noting that the President supported his fiscal year 2019 budget \n25  request for border barrier funding with a description that such a barrier “is critical to combating \n26  the scourge of drug addiction that leads to thousands of unnecessary deaths.”  Mot. at 16 (quoting \n27  Citizen Groups RJN Ex. R, at 16). \n28  In response, Defendants again seek to minimize the pass-through nature of DoD’s counter-\n34 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 35 of 56\n \n1  drug activities authority under Section 284.  While not disputing that the President requested—and \n2  was denied—more-comprehensive funds for border barrier construction, Defendants instead note \n3  that “[t]he President’s 2019 budget request did not propose additional funding for DoD’s \n4  counterdrug activities under [Section] 284.”  Opp. at 16.  Defendants then argue that because DHS \n5  only formally requested Section 284 support in February 2019, the need for Section 284 support \n6  only become foreseen in February 2019.  Id. at 16–17. \n7  Separate and apart from the Court’s analysis above regarding whether Congress previously \n8  denied funding for the relevant item, Plaintiffs also have shown a likelihood of success as to their \n9  argument that Defendants fail to meet the “unforeseen military requirement” condition for the \n10  reprogramming of funds under Section 8005.  As the House notes in its amicus brief, DoD has \n11  used this authority in the past to transfer funds based on unanticipated circumstances (such as \n12  hurricane and typhoon damage to military bases) justifying a departure from the scope of spending \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  previously authorized by Congress.  House Br. at 10 (citing Office of the Under Secretary of \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  Defense (Comptroller), DoD Serial No. FY 04-37 PA, Reprogramming Action (Sept. 3, 2004)).  \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Here, however, Defendants claim that what was “unforeseen” was “[t]he need for DoD to exercise \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  its [Section] 284 authority to provide support for counter-drug activities,” which “did not arise \nS d nr\nee 17  until February 2019, when DHS requested support from DoD to construct fencing in drug \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  trafficking corridors.”  Opp. at 16. \n19  Defendants’ argument that the need for the requested border barrier construction funding \n20  was “unforeseen” cannot logically be squared with the Administration’s multiple requests for \n21  funding for exactly that purpose dating back to at least early 2018.  See Citizen Groups Ex. R \n22  (February 2018 White House Budget Request describing “the Administration’s proposal for $18 \n23  billion to fund the border wall”); see also States RJN Exs. 14–20 (failed bills); id. Ex. 21 \n24  (December 11, 2018 transcript from a meeting with members of Congress, where the President \n25  stated that “if we don’t get what we want [for border barrier construction funding], one way or the \n26  other – whether it’s through you, through a military, through anything you want to call [sic] – I \n27  will shut down the government”); Case No. 4:19-cv-00872-HSG, ECF No. 89-12, at 14 (testimony \n28  of Defendant Shanahan before the House Armed Services Committee explaining that the \n35 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 36 of 56\n \n1  Administration discussed unilateral reprogramming “prior to the declaration of a national \n2  emergency”).  Further, even the purported need for DoD to provide DHS with support for border \n3  security has similarly been long asserted.  See States RJN Ex. 27 (April 4, 2018 presidential \n4  memorandum directing the Secretary of Defense to support DHS “in securing the southern border \n5  and taking other necessary actions” due to “[t]he crisis at our southern border”).  Defendants’ \n6  suggestion that by not specifically seeking border barrier funding under Section 284 by name, the \n7  Administration can later contend that as far as DoD is concerned, the need for such funding is \n8  “unforeseen,” is not likely to withstand scrutiny.  \n9  Interpreting “unforeseen” to refer to the request for DoD assistance, as opposed to the \n10  underlying “requirement” at issue, also is not reasonable.  By Defendants’ logic, every request for \n11  Section 284 support would be for an “unforeseen military requirement,” because only once the \n12  request was made would the “need to exercise authority” under the statute be foreseen.  There is \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  no logical reason to stretch the definition of “unforeseen military requirement” from requirements \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  that the government as a whole plainly cannot predict (like the need to repair hurricane damage) to \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  requirements that plainly were foreseen by the government as a whole (even if DoD did not realize \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  that it would be asked to pay for them until after Congress declined to appropriate funds requested \nS d nr\nee 17  by another agency).  Nothing presented by the Defendants suggests that its interpretation is what \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Congress had in mind when it imposed the “unforeseen” limitation, especially where, as here, \n19  multiple agencies are openly coordinating in an effort to build a project that Congress declined to \n20  fund.  The Court thus finds it likely that Plaintiffs will succeed on this claim.17  \n21  iii.  Accepting Defendants’ Proposed Interpretation of \nSection 8005’s Requirements Would Likely Raise Serious \n22  Constitutional Questions. \n23  The Court also finds it likely that Defendants’ reading of these provisions, if accepted, \n24  would pose serious problems under the Constitution’s separation of powers principles.  Statutes \n25  must be interpreted to avoid a serious constitutional problem where another “construction of the \n26 \n                                                 \n27 \n17 Because the Court has found that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their argument that the \nreprogramming violates the two Section 8005 conditions discussed above, it need not reach at this \n28 \nstage their argument that the border barrier project is not a “military requirement” at all. \n36 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 37 of 56\n \n1  statute is fairly possible by which the question may be avoided.” Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, \n2  689 (2001) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  Constitutional avoidance is “thus a \n3  means of giving effect to congressional intent,” as it is presumed that Congress did not intend to \n4  create an alternative interpretation that would raise serious constitutional concerns.  Clark v. \n5  Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 382 (2005).  Courts thus “have read significant limitations into . . . \n6  statutes in order to avoid their constitutional invalidation.”  Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 689 (citation \n7  omitted).  \n8    As Plaintiffs point out, the upshot of Defendants’ argument is that the Acting Secretary of \n9  Defense is authorized to use Section 8005 to funnel an additional $1 billion to the Section 284 \n10  account for border barrier construction, notwithstanding that (1) Congress decided to appropriate \n11  only $1.375 billion for that purpose; (2) Congress’s total fiscal year 2019 appropriation available \n12  under Section 284 for “[c]onstruction of roads and fences and installation of lighting to block drug \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  smuggling corridors across international boundaries of the United States” was $517 million, much \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  of which already has been spent; and (3) Defendants have acknowledged that the Administration \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  considered reprogramming funds for border barrier construction even before the President signed \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  into law Congress’s $1.375 billion appropriation.  See Department of Defense and Labor, Health \nS d nr\nee 17  and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act, 2019, Pub. L. No. 115-245, div. A, tit. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  VI, 132 Stat. 2981, 2997 (2018) (appropriating $881 million in funds “[f]or drug interdiction and \n19  counter-drug activities” in fiscal year 2019, $517 million of which is “for counter-narcotics \n20  support”); Dkt. No. 131 at 4 (indicating that Defendants have not used—and do not intend to use \n21  in the near future—any funds appropriated by Congress for counter-narcotics support for border \n22  barrier construction); Case No. 4:19-cv-00872-HSG, ECF No. 89-12, at 14 (testimony of \n23  Defendant Shanahan before the House Armed Services Committee explaining that the \n24  Administration discussed unilateral reprogramming “prior to the declaration of a national \n25  emergency”).  Put differently, according to Defendants, Section 8005 authorizes the Acting \n26  Secretary of Defense to essentially triple—or quintuple, when considering the recent additional \n27  $1.5 billion reprogramming—the amount Congress allocated to this account for these purposes, \n28  notwithstanding Congress’s recent and clear actions in passing the CAA, and the relevant \n37 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 38 of 56\n \n1  committees’ express disapproval of the proposed reprogramming.  See States RJN Ex. 35 (“The \n2  committee denies this request.  The committee does not approve the proposed use of [DoD] funds \n3  to construct additional physical barriers and roads or install lighting in the vicinity of the United \n4  States border.”); id. Ex. 36 (“The Committee has received and reviewed the requested \n5  reprogramming action . . . .  The Committee denies the request.”).  Moreover, Defendants’ \n6  decision not to refer specifically to Section 284 in their $5.7 billion funding request deprived \n7  Congress of even the opportunity to reject or approve this funding item.18 \n8  The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that reading Section 8005 to permit this massive \n9  redirection of funds under these circumstances likely would amount to an “unbounded \n10  authorization for Defendants to rewrite the federal budget,” Reply at 14, and finds that \n11  Defendants’ reading likely would violate the Constitution’s separation of powers principles.  \n12  Defendants contend that because Congress did not reject (and, indeed, never had the opportunity \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  to reject) a specific request for an appropriation to the Section 284 drug interdiction fund, DoD \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  can use Section 8005 to route anywhere up to the $4 billion cap set by that statute, to be spent for \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  the benefit of DHS via Section 284.  But this reading of DoD’s authority under the statute would \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  render meaningless Congress’s constitutionally-mandated power to assess proposed spending, \nS d nr\nee 17  then render its binding judgment as to the scope of permissible spending.  See FDA v. Brown & \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 133 (2000) (holding that the interpretation of statutes \n19  “must be guided to a degree by common sense as to the manner in which Congress is likely to \n20  delegate a policy decision of such economic and political magnitude”); Util. Air Regulatory Grp. \n21  v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 324 (2014) (“We expect Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to \n22  an agency decisions of vast economic and political significance.”) (internal quotation marks \n23  omitted).  This is especially true given that Congress has repeatedly rejected legislation that would \n24 \n                                                 \n25 \n18 Defendants do not convincingly explain why the amount now sought to be transferred under \nSection 8005 could not have been sought directly from Congress as part of the fiscal year 2019 \n26 \nappropriation to the DoD Section 284 account to cover requests for counterdrug support, given \nthat the President has consistently maintained since before taking office that border barrier funding \n27 \nis necessary.  If the answer is that the Administration expected, or hoped, that Congress would \nappropriate the funds to DHS directly, that highlights rather than mitigates the present problem \n28 \nwith Defendants’ position. \n38 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 39 of 56\n \n1  have funded substantially broader border barrier construction, as noted above, deciding in the end \n2  to appropriate only $1.375 billion.  See City & Cty. of San Francisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, \n3  1234 (9th Cir. 2018) (“In fact, Congress has frequently considered and thus far rejected legislation \n4  accomplishing the goals of the Executive Order.  The sheer amount of failed legislation on this \n5  issue demonstrates the importance and divisiveness of the policies in play, reinforcing the \n6  Constitution’s ‘unmistakable expression of a determination that legislation by the national \n7  Congress be a step-by-step, deliberate and deliberative process.’”) (citing Chadha, 462 U.S. at \n8  959).  In short, the Constitution gives Congress the exclusive power “not only to formulate \n9  legislative policies and mandate programs and projects, but also to establish their relative priority \n10  for the Nation,” McIntosh, 833 F.3d at 1172, and “Congress cannot yield up its own powers” in \n11  this regard, Clinton, 524 U.S. at 452 (Kennedy, J., concurring).  Defendants’ interpretation of \n12  Section 8005 is inconsistent with these principles.   \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  While Defendants argue that the text and history of Section 284 suggest that their proposed \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  transfer and use of the funds are within the scope of what Congress has permitted previously, Opp. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  at 18, that argument only highlights the serious constitutional questions that accepting their \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  position would create.  First, Defendants note that in the past DoD has completed what they \nS d nr\nee 17  characterize as “large-scale fencing projects” with Congress’s approval.  Opp. at 18 (citing H.R. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Rep. No. 103-200, at 330–31 (1993)).  But Congress’s past approval of relatively small \n19  expenditures, that were well within the total amount allocated by Congress to DoD under Section \n20  284’s predecessor, speaks not at all to Defendants’ current claim that the Acting Secretary has \n21  authority to redirect sums over a hundred orders of magnitude greater to that account in the face of \n22  Congress’s appropriations judgment in the CAA.  Similarly, whether or not Section 284 formally \n23  “limits” the Secretary to “small scale construction” (defined in Section 284(i)(3) as “construction \n24  at a cost not to exceed $750,000 for any project”), reading the statute to suggest that Congress \n25  requires reporting of tiny projects but nonetheless has delegated authority to DoD to conduct the \n26  massive funnel-and-spend project proposed here is implausible, and likely would raise serious \n27  questions as to the constitutionality of such an interpretation.  See Whitman v. Am. Trucking \n28  Ass’ns, 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001) (noting that Congress “does not, one might say, hide elephants \n39 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 40 of 56\n \n1  in mouseholes”).  \n2   Similarly, if “unforeseen” has the meaning that Defendants claim, Section 8005 would \n3  give the agency making a request for assistance under Section 284 complete control over whether \n4  that condition is met, simply by virtue of the timing of the request.  As here, DHS could wait and \n5  see whether Congress granted a requested appropriation, then turn to DoD if Congress declined, \n6  and DoD could always characterize the resulting request as raising an “unforeseen” requirement \n7  because it did not come earlier.  Under this interpretation, DoD could in essence make a de facto \n8  appropriation to DHS, evading congressional control entirely.  The Court finds that this \n9  interpretation likely would pose serious problems under the Appropriations Clause, by ceding \n10  essentially boundless appropriations judgment to the executive agencies. \n11  Finally, the Court has serious concerns with Defendants’ theory of appropriations law, \n12  which presumes that the Executive Branch can exercise spending authority unless Congress \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  explicitly restricts such authority by statute.  Counsel for Defendants advanced this theory at the \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  hearing on this motion, arguing that when Congress passed the recent DoD appropriations act \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  containing Section 8005, it “could have” expressly “restrict[ed] that authority” to preclude \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  reprogramming funds for border barrier construction.  See Dkt. No. 138 at 76:16–77:3.  According \nS d nr\nee 17  to Defendants:  “If Congress had wanted to deny DOD this specific use of that [reprogramming] \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  authority, that’s something it needed to actually do in an explicit way in the appropriations \n19  process.  And it didn’t.”  Id. at 77:21–24.  But it is not Congress’s burden to prohibit the Executive \n20  from spending the Nation’s funds: it is the Executive’s burden to show that its desired use of those \n21  funds was “affirmatively approved by Congress.”  See FLRA, 665 F.3d at 1348 (“[A]ll uses of \n22  appropriated funds must be affirmatively approved by Congress,” and “the mere absence of a \n23  prohibition is not sufficient.”).  To have this any other way would deprive Congress of its absolute \n24  control over the power of the purse, “one of the most important authorities allocated to Congress \n25  in the Constitution’s ‘necessary partition of power among the several departments.’”  Id. at 1346–\n26  47 (quoting The Federalist No. 51, at 320 (James Madison) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961)). \n27  To the extent Defendants believe the Ninth Circuit’s decision in McIntosh suggests \n28  anything to the contrary, the Court disagrees.  Defendants appeared to argue at the hearing on this \n40 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 41 of 56\n \n1  motion that McIntosh stands for the principle that the Executive enjoys unfettered spending power \n2  unless Congress crafts an appropriations rider cabining such authority.  See Dkt. No. 138 at 75:5–\n3  10.  As counsel for Defendants put it, “[Plaintiffs] want to say that something was denied by \n4  Congress if it wasn’t funded by Congress. . . .  But that is just not how these statutes are written \n5  and that’s not how [McIntosh] tells us we interpret the appropriations statute.”  Id. at 75:13–20.  \n6  But Defendants overlook that no party in McIntosh disputed that the government’s use of funds \n7  was authorized but for the appropriations rider at issue in that case.  See 833 F.3d at 1175 (“The \n8  parties dispute whether the government’s spending money on their prosecutions violates [the \n9  appropriations rider].”).  It is thus unremarkable that when faced with a dispute exclusively \n10  concerning whether the government’s otherwise-authorized spending of money violated an \n11  appropriations rider, the Ninth Circuit held that “[i]t is a fundamental principle of appropriations \n12  law that we may only consider the text of an appropriations rider.”  Id. at 1178; see also Dkt. No. \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  138 at 75:5–10 (defense counsel relying on this language from McIntosh).  \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  Unlike in McIntosh, where the sole dispute concerned the scope of an external limitation \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  on an otherwise-authorized spending of money, the present dispute concerns the scope of \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  limitations within Section 8005 itself on the authorization of reprogramming funds.  Whether \nS d nr\nee 17  Congress gives authority in the first place is not the same issue as whether Congress later restricts \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  that authority.  And it cannot be the case that Congress must draft an appropriations rider to \n19  breathe life into the internal limitations in Section 8005 establishing that the Executive may only \n20  reprogram money based on unforeseen military requirements, and may not do so where the item \n21  for which funds are requested has been denied by Congress.  To adopt Defendants’ position would \n22  read out these limitations entirely, which the Court cannot do.  See Life Techs. Corp. v. Promega \n23  Corp., 137 S. Ct. 734, 740 (2017) (“Whenever possible, however, we should favor an \n24  interpretation that gives meaning to each statutory provision.”).  To give meaning to—and thus to \n25  construe the scope of—these internal limitations is wholly consistent with McIntosh, which \n26  explained that the Executive’s authority to spend is at all times limited “by the text of the \n27  appropriation.”  833 F.3d at 1178 (internal quotation marks omitted). \n28  For all of these reasons, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success \n41 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 42 of 56\n \n1  as to their argument that the reprogramming of $1 billion under Section 8005 to the Section 284 \n2  account for border barrier construction is unlawful.19 \n3  b.  Section 2808 \n4  At the President’s direction, the DoD intends to use up to $3.6 billion in military \n5  construction funding to facilitate border barrier construction.  Defendants rely on Section 2808, \n6  under which the Secretary of Defense may “undertake military construction projects, and may \n7  authorize the Secretaries of the military departments to undertake military construction projects, \n8  not otherwise authorized by law.”  10 U.S.C. § 2808(a).  As is relevant here, Section 2808 requires \n9  that (1) the President first declare a national emergency in accordance with the NEA that “requires \n10  use of the armed forces,” (2) the use of funds be for “military construction projects,” and (3) the \n11  military construction projects be “necessary to support such use of the armed forces.”  Id.  \n12  Plaintiffs contend that Defendants’ plan to use Section 2808 to build a barrier on the U.S.-Mexico \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  border fails all three requirements. \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  Under the circumstances, it is unclear how border barrier construction could reasonably \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  constitute a “military construction project” such that Defendants’ invocation of Section 2808 \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  would be lawful.  Section 2808 authorizes the Secretary of Defense to “undertake military \nS d nr\nee 17  construction projects.”  And Congress defined the term “military construction,” as it is used in \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Section 2808, to “include[] any construction, development, conversion, or extension of any kind \n19  carried out with respect to a military installation, whether to satisfy temporary or permanent \n20  requirements, or any acquisition of land or construction of a defense access road.”  10 U.S.C. \n21 \n                                                 \n22 \n19 Defendants have now acknowledged that all of the money they plan to spend on border barrier \nconstruction under Section 284 is money transferred into that account under Section 8005.  See \n23 \nDkt. No. 131 at 4.  Given this acknowledgment, and the Court’s finding that Plaintiffs are likely to \nshow that the Section 8005 reprogramming is unlawful, the Court need not at this stage decide \n24 \nwhether Defendants would have been permitted to use for border barrier construction any \nremaining funds that Congress appropriated to the Section 284 account for fiscal year 2019.  The \n25 \nCourt notes that the House confirmed in its own lawsuit that it “does not challenge the expenditure \nof any remaining appropriated funds under section 284 on the construction of a border wall.”  \n26 \nUnited States House of Representatives’ Application for a Preliminary Injunction at 30, U.S. \nHouse of Representatives v. Mnuchin, No. 1:19-cv-00969 (TNM) (D.D.C. Apr. 23, 2019), ECF \n27 \nNo. 17; see also House Br. at 17 (requesting preliminary injunction “prohibiting defendants from \ntransferring and spending funds in excess of what Congress appropriated for counter-narcotics \n28 \nsupport under 10 U.S.C. § 284”). \n42 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 43 of 56\n \n1  § 2801(a).  Congress in turn defined the term “military installation” to “mean[] a base, camp, post, \n2  station, yard, center, or other activity under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of a military \n3  department or, in the case of an activity in a foreign country, under the operational control of the \n4  Secretary of a military department or the Secretary of Defense, without regard to the duration of \n5  operational control.”  Id. § 2801(c)(4). \n6  Plaintiffs reason that border barrier construction does not constitute construction “carried \n7  out with respect to a military installation,” because (1) the U.S.-Mexico border is not a military \n8  “base, camp, post, station, yard, center” or “defense access road;” and (2) securing the border is \n9  not an “activity under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of a military department.”  Mot. at 14.  \n10  Instead, Congress assigned responsibility for “[s]ecuring the borders” to DHS.  See 6 U.S.C. \n11  § 202.  Defendants respond that although the statute defines both “military construction” and its \n12  nested term, “military installation,” “[b]road terms defining military construction as ‘includ[ing]’ \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  (but not limited to, see 10 U.S.C. § 101(f)(4)) construction with respect to a military installation, \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  and defining military installation to include non-specified ‘other activity,’ are not the kind of clear \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  and mandatory statutory language that is a necessary predicate to an ultra vires claim.”  Opp. at 23. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Defendants’ arguments prove too much.  As explained above, Defendants misunderstand \nS d nr\nee 17  the standard for ultra vires review.  More to the merits, the plain language of the relevant statutory \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  definitions does not demonstrate the sort of unbounded authority that Defendants suggest.  \n19  Turning first to the statutory definition of “military construction,” that it uses the word “includes” \n20  when it provides that military construction “includes any construction, development, conversion, \n21  or extension of any kind carried out with respect to a military installation” is irrelevant.  No one \n22  disputes that border barrier construction constitutes “construction.”  What matters is that Section \n23  2801(a) limits such construction—however broad that term might be—to construction related to a \n24  military installation.  In other words, the critical language of Section 2801(a) is not the word \n25  “includes,” it is the condition “with respect to a military installation.” \n26  Turning next to the statutory definition of “military installation,” Section 2801(c)(4) \n27  provides in relevant part that it “means a base, camp, post, station, yard, center, or other activity \n28  under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of a military department.”  And Defendants make no \n43 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 44 of 56\n \n1  attempt to characterize the U.S.-Mexico border or a border barrier as a “base, camp, post, station, \n2  yard, [or] center.”  Nor could they.  Defendants instead contend that border barrier construction is \n3  authorized under the catch-all term “other activity.”  See Dkt. No. 138 at 92:9–93:22.  \n4  In interpreting Section 2801 to determine whether Defendants’ plan to construct a barrier \n5  on the U.S.-Mexico border falls within the “other activity” category, the Court applies “traditional \n6  tools of statutory construction.”  Rumsey Indian Rancheria of Wintun Indians v. Wilson, 64 F.3d \n7  1250, 1257 (9th Cir. 1994), amended on denial of reh’g by 99 F.3d 321 (9th Cir. 1996).  The Court \n8  “begin[s] with the statute’s language, which is conclusive unless literally applying the statute’s \n9  text demonstrably contradicts Congress’s intent.”  Chemehuevi Indian Tribe v. Newsom, 919 F.3d \n10  1148, 1151 (9th Cir. 2019).  “When deciding whether the language is plain, courts must read the \n11  words in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.”  Id. (quoting \n12  Rainero v. Archon Corp., 844 F.3d 832, 837 (9th Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks and \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  alterations omitted)).   \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  Applying traditional tools of statutory construction, Section 2801 likely precludes treating \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  the southern border as an “other activity.”  Defendants on this point fail to appreciate that the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  words immediately preceding “or other activity” in Section 2801(c)(4)— “a base, camp, post, \nS d nr\nee 17  station, yard, [and] center”—provide contextual limits on the catch-all term.  The Court thus relies \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  on the doctrine of noscitur a sociis, “which is that a word is known by the company it keeps.”  \n19  Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., Inc., 513 U.S. 561, 575 (1995).  Courts apply this rule “to avoid ascribing \n20  to one word a meaning so broad that it is inconsistent with its accompanying words, thus giving \n21  ‘unintended breadth to the Acts of Congress.’” Id. (quoting Jarecki v. G.D. Searle & Co., 367 U.S. \n22  303, 307 (1961)).  The Supreme Court has relied on this canon of statutory interpretation many \n23  times when construing detailed statutory lists followed by catch-all-type terms.  Most recently, in \n24  Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis, the Court limited the term “other concerted activities” in Section 7 of \n25  the National Labor Relations Act to refer to “things employees ‘just do’ for themselves in the \n26  course of exercising their right to free association in the workplace,” rather than any concerted \n27  activity whatsoever—including class and collective actions—because the term appeared at the end \n28  of a detailed list of specific activities, none of which “speak[] to the procedures judges or \n44 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 45 of 56\n \n1  arbitrators must apply in disputes that leave the workplace and enter the courtroom or arbitral \n2  forum.”  138 S. Ct. 1612, 1625 (2018).  Before that, in Gustafson, the Supreme Court construed \n3  the word “communication” as used in Section 2(10) of the Securities Act of 1933 to “refer[] to a \n4  public communication” and not any communication whatsoever, because the word followed a list \n5  of other terms—“prospectus, notice, circular, advertisement, [and] letter”—in consideration of \n6  which “it [was] apparent that the list refers to documents of wide dissemination.”  513 U.S. at 575. \n7  Noscitur a sociis applies with equal force in the present circumstance.  The term “other \n8  activity” appears after a list of closely related types of discrete and traditional military locations: \n9  “a base, camp, post, station, yard, [and] center.”  It is thus proper to construe “other activity” as \n10  referring to similar discrete and traditional military locations.  The Court does not readily see how \n11  the U.S.-Mexico border could fit this bill.   \n12  The Court also finds relevant the ejusdem generis canon of statutory interpretation, which \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  counsels that “[w]here general words follow specific words in a statutory enumeration, the general \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  words are construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  preceding specific words.”  Wash. State Dept. of Social & Health Servs. v. Guardianship Estate of \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Keffeler, 537 U.S. 371, 384 (2003) (quoting Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U.S. 105, 114–\nS d nr\nee 17  15 (2001)).  At the hearing on this motion, Defendants argued that the term “other activity” \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  “capture[s] everything under the jurisdiction of the secretary of a military department.”  Dkt. No. \n19  138 at 92:9–13.  The Court disagrees.  Had Congress intended for “other activity” in Section \n20  2801(c)(4) to be so broad as to transform literally any activity conducted by a Secretary of a \n21  military department into a “military installation”, there would have been no reason to include a list \n22  of specific, discrete military locations.  See Yates v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 1074, 1087 (2015) \n23  (“Had Congress intended ‘tangible object’ in § 1519 to be interpreted so generically as to capture \n24  physical objects as dissimilar as documents and fish, Congress would have had no reason to refer \n25  specifically to ‘record’ or ‘document.’  The Government’s unbounded reading of ‘tangible object’ \n26  would render those words misleading surplusage.”); CSX Transp., Inc. v. Ala. Dept. of Revenue, \n27  562 U.S. 277, 295 (“We typically use ejusdem generis to ensure that a general word will not \n28  render specific words meaningless.”). \n45 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 46 of 56\n \n1  To be clear, “other activity” is not an empty term.  Congress undoubtedly contemplated \n2  that military installations would encompass more than just “a base, camp, post, station, yard, [or] \n3  center.”  But the Court need not stake out the term’s outer limits here.  All that matters for present \n4  purposes is that, in context and with an eye toward the overall statutory scheme, nothing \n5  demonstrates that Congress ever contemplated that “other activity” has such an unbounded reading \n6  that it would authorize Defendants to invoke Section 2808 to build a barrier on the southern \n7  border.   \n8  Despite its concerns with Defendants’ arguments on this point, the Court need not now \n9  address whether Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that Defendants’ \n10  ultimate plan to divert funds under Section 2808 is ultra vires.  That is because, as discussed \n11  below, Plaintiffs have not met their independently necessary burden of showing a likelihood of \n12  irreparable harm from the use of funds under Section 2808 for construction at as-yet-unspecified \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  locations so as to be entitled to a preliminary injunction. \nCfi\nt la\nciC 14  c.  NEPA \nrts fo\niD tc 15  After Plaintiffs filed the instant motion—and one day before Defendants filed their \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  opposition—the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security invoked his authority under Section \nS d nr\nee 17  102(c) of IIRIRA to waive any NEPA requirements for construction in the El Paso and Yuma \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  sectors.  See Opp. at 25–26; see also Determination Pursuant to Section 102 of the Illegal \n19  Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, as Amended, 84 Fed. Reg. \n20  17185-01 (Apr. 24, 2019); REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-13, § 102, 119 Stat. 231, 306 \n21  (May 11, 2005) (amending Section 102(c) to reflect that the Secretary “ha[s] the authority to \n22  waive all legal requirements” that, in the “Secretary’s sole discretion,” are “necessary to ensure \n23  expeditious construction” of barriers and roads).  The Acting Secretary later waived NEPA \n24  requirements for the El Centro and Tucson Sectors Projects as well, on the same basis.  See \n25  Determination Pursuant to Section 102 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \n26  Responsibility Act of 1996, as Amended, 84 Fed. Reg. 21,798 (May 15, 2019); Determination \n27  Pursuant to Section 102 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of \n28  1996, as Amended, 84 Fed. Reg. 21,800 (May 15, 2019).   \n46 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 47 of 56\n \n1  Defendants contend that such waivers preclude Plaintiffs from advancing a NEPA claim.  \n2  Opp. at 26 (citing In re Border Infrastructure Envtl. Litig., 915 F.3d 1213, 1221 (9th Cir. 2019)).  \n3  Plaintiffs respond that DHS’s authority to waive NEPA requirements for construction under \n4  IIRIRA does not extend to construction undertaken by DoD under its own spending authority.  \n5  Reply at 18–19.  Plaintiffs further contend that “Defendants’ argument is incompatible with their \n6  own claim that they are not constructing the El Paso and Yuma sections of border wall under \n7  IIRIRA authority, but instead under the wholly separate DoD authority,” and suggest that \n8  “Defendants cannot have it both ways.”  Reply at 18–19. \n9  Neither set of Plaintiffs appears to contest that the waivers, if applicable, would be \n10  dispositive of the NEPA claims.  See, e.g., Plaintiff States’ Reply at 16, California v. Trump, No. \n11  4:19-cv-00872-HSG (N.D. Cal. May 2, 2019), ECF No. 112 (“States Reply”) (“Plaintiffs do not \n12  dispute DHS’s ability to waive NEPA compliance when constructing barriers pursuant to \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  [IIRIRA], with funds specifically appropriated by Congress to be used for that construction.”) \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  (emphasis in original); see also In re Border Infrastructure Envtl. Litig., 915 F.3d at 1221 (“[A] \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  valid waiver of the relevant environmental laws under section 102(c) is an affirmative defense to \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  all the environmental claims [including NEPA claims],” and is “dispositive of [those] claims.”).  \nS d nr\nee 17  But Plaintiffs contend that “the DHS Secretary’s waiver under IIRIRA does not waive DOD’s \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  obligations to comply with NEPA prior to proceeding with El Paso Project 1 under DOD’s \n19  statutory authority, 10 U.S.C. § 284, and using DOD’s appropriations,” so that “DHS’s waiver has \n20  no application to this project.”  States Reply at 16 (emphasis added); see also Reply at 19 \n21  (“Defendants identify no statutory authority for a waiver for ‘expeditious construction’ under \n22  DOD’s § 284 authority, and none exists.”). \n23  The Court finds that Plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on their NEPA argument because \n24  of the waivers issued by DHS.  DoD’s authority under Section 284 is derivative.  Under the \n25  statute, DoD is limited to providing support (including construction support) to other agencies, and \n26  may invoke its authority only in response to a request from such an agency.  See 10 U.S.C. § 284 \n27  (“The Secretary of Defense may provide support for the counterdrug activities . . . of any other \n28  department or agency of the Federal Government,” including support for “[c]onstruction of roads \n47 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 48 of 56\n \n1  and fences,” if “such support is requested . . . by the official who has responsibility for the \n2  counterdrug activities.”).  Here, DHS has made such a request, invoking “its authority under \n3  Section 102 of IIRIRA to install additional physical barriers and roads” in designated areas, \n4  seeking support for its “ability to impede and deny illegal entry and drug smuggling activities.”  \n5  Citizen Groups RJN Ex. I, at 1.  DHS requested DoD’s assistance “[t]o support DHS’s action \n6  under Section 102.”  Id. at 2.  Plaintiffs’ argument would require the Court to find that even \n7  though it is undisputed that DHS could waive NEPA’s requirements if it were paying for the \n8  projects out of its own budget, that waiver is inoperative when DoD provides support in response \n9  to a request from DHS.  The Court finds it unlikely that Congress intended to impose different \n10  NEPA requirements on DoD when it acts in support of DHS’s Section 102 authority in response to \n11  a direct request under Section 284 than would apply to DHS itself.20  See Defs. of Wildlife v. \n12  Chertoff, 527 F. Supp. 2d 119, 121, 129  (D.D.C. 2007) (finding DHS’s Section 102 waiver \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  authority authorized the DHS Secretary to waive legal requirements where the U.S. Army Corps \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  of Engineers, a federal agency within the DoD, was constructing border fencing “on behalf of \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  DHS”).21 \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  2.  Likelihood of Irreparable Injury \nS d nr\nee 17  Plaintiffs advance three theories of irreparable harm: (1) harm to their members’ aesthetic \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  and recreational interests in areas threatened by border barrier construction; (2) constitutional \n19  harm; and (3) harm to Plaintiff SBCC and its member organizations’ ability to carry out their \n20  missions.  Mot. at 22–25; Reply at 19–24.  Critical to this analysis is that while Defendants have \n21  committed to fund border barrier construction in the El Paso Sector 1 and Yuma Sector 1 projects \n22 \n                                                 \n23 \n20 Plaintiff States argue that “[i]n another context, Congress explicitly allows the DOD Secretary \nto request ‘the head of another agency responsible for the administration of navigation or vessel-\n24 \ninspection laws to waive compliance with those laws to the extent the Secretary considers \nnecessary.’”  States Reply at 17 (citing 46 U.S.C. § 501(a)).  The Court finds this statute to be \n25 \nirrelevant to the issue here.  In this case, DoD is acting solely in response to DHS’s request for \nsupport under Section 102; DHS has undisputed authority to issue waivers under that section; and \n26 \nit would not make sense to make NEPA compliance a condition of DoD’s derivative support \nnotwithstanding DHS’s waiver.   \n27 \n21 To the extent Plaintiffs’ argument is that the government “cannot have it both ways,” the Court \nagrees, to the extent it found a likelihood of success as to Plaintiffs’ Section 8005 argument, as \n28 \ndiscussed in Section IV.B.1.a, above. \n48 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 49 of 56\n \n1  using funds reprogrammed and subsequently used under Sections 8005 and 284, Defendants have \n2  not committed to fund any border barrier construction using Section 2808.  Because of this \n3  distinction, the Court addresses the two categories separately.  \n4  a.  Sections 8005 and 284 \n5  The Court finds that Plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of irreparable harm to their \n6  members’ aesthetic and recreational interests in the areas known as El Paso Sector Project 1 and \n7  Yuma Sector Project 1. \n8  As the Ninth Circuit has explained, “it would be incorrect to hold that all potential \n9  environmental injury warrants an injunction.”  League of Wilderness Defs./Blue Mountains \n10  Biodiversity Project v. Connaughton, 752 F.3d 755, 764 (9th Cir. 2014).  “Environmental injury,” \n11  however, “by its nature, can seldom be adequately remedied by money damages and is often \n12  permanent or at least of long duration, i.e., irreparable.”  Amoco Prod. Co. v. Vill. of Gambell, \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Alaska, 480 U.S. 531, 545 (1987).  Plaintiffs must nonetheless demonstrate that irreparable injury \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  “is likely in the absence of an injunction.”  Winter, 555 U.S. at 22.  Mere “possibility” of \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  irreparable harm does not merit a preliminary injunction.  Id.  But it is well-established in the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Ninth Circuit that an organization can demonstrate irreparable harm by showing that the \nS d nr\nee 17  challenged action will injure its members’ enjoyment of public land.  See All. for Wild Rockies, \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  632 F.3d at 1135. \n19  Turning to Plaintiffs’ aesthetic and recreational interests, Plaintiffs provide declarations \n20  from several members, detailing how Defendants’ proposed use of funds reprogrammed under \n21  Section 8005 and then used under Section 284 for border barrier construction will harm their \n22  ability to recreate in and otherwise enjoy public land along the border.  See Dkt. No. 30 (“Del Val \n23  Decl.”) ¶¶ 7–9 (alleging harm from border barrier construction and the accompanying lighting in \n24  the Yuma Sector Project 1 to declarant’s “ability to fish” and general enjoyment of natural \n25  environment); Dkt. No. 31 (“Munro Decl.”) ¶ 11 (alleging harm from border barrier construction \n26  in El Paso Sector Project 1 to declarant’s “happiness and sense of fulfillment,” which she \n27  “derive[s] from visiting these beautiful landscapes”); Dkt. No. 34 (“Bixby Decl.”) ¶¶ 6, 12 \n28  (alleging harm from border barrier construction in El Paso Sector Project 1 to declarant’s hiking \n49 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 50 of 56\n \n1  and camping interests); Dkt. No. 35 (“Walsh Decl.”) ¶¶ 8–12 (alleging harm from border barrier \n2  construction in El Paso Sector Project 1 to declarant’s recreational interests, including “bird \n3  watching and hiking”).   \n4  Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ alleged recreational harms are insufficient for two \n5  reasons.  First, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated “that any species-level \n6  impacts are likely as a result of border wall construction.”  See Opp. at 29.  But Defendants here \n7  misunderstand Plaintiffs’ theory.  Plaintiffs’ declarants nowhere state that their recreational \n8  interest is merely the enjoyment of a particular species.  Defendants’ second argument is that their \n9  planned “replacement of existing pedestrian border infrastructure . . . will not change conditions \n10  where Mr. Del Val fishes.”  Id. at 30–31.  But Defendants here understate the effects of what they \n11  now characterize as mere “replacement of existing pedestrian border infrastructure.”  By \n12  Defendants’ own description, they intend to replace four-to-six-foot vehicle barriers in the Yuma \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Sector Project 1 area with a thirty-foot “bollard wall,” where “[t]he bollards are steel-filled \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  concrete that are approximately six inches in diameter and spaced approximately four inches \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  apart” and accompanied by lighting.  See Dkt. No. 64-9 (“Enriquez Decl.”) ¶ 12 & Ex. C, at 2-1.  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Even if the characteristics of the wall were unchanged—which is not the case—Mr. Del Val \nS d nr\nee 17  alleges recreational harms from not only the bollard wall construction but also the accompanying \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  lighting, which does not currently exist.  See Del Val Decl. ¶ 9.  Because the Court finds that \n19  Defendants’ proposed construction in Yuma Sector Project 1 constitutes a change in conditions for \n20  Mr. Del Val, it rejects Defendants’ second challenge to Plaintiffs’ alleged recreational harms.  \n21  Plaintiffs have shown that Defendants’ proposed construction will lead to a substantial \n22  change in the environment, the nature of which will harm their members’ aesthetic and \n23  recreational interests.  The funding of border barrier construction, if indeed barred by law, cannot \n24  be remedied easily after the fact, and yet Defendants intend to commence construction \n25  immediately and complete it expeditiously.  Thus, “[t]he harm here, as with many instances of this \n26  kind of harm, is irreparable for the purposes of the preliminary injunction analysis.”  See League \n27  of Wilderness Defenders/Blue Mountains Biodiversity Project, 752 F.3d at 764. \n28  // \n50 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 51 of 56\n \n1  b.  Section 2808 \n2  Because Defendants have not disclosed a plan for diverting funds under Section 2808 for \n3  border barrier construction, the Court cannot now determine a likelihood of harm to Plaintiffs’ \n4  members’ aesthetic and recreational interests.  The Court thus turns to Plaintiffs’ other theories of \n5  irreparable injury. \n6  To start, to the extent Plaintiffs rely on American Trucking Associations, Inc. v. City of Los \n7  Angeles, 559 F.3d 1046, 1058–59 (9th Cir. 2009), for the principle that a constitutional violation \n8  alone suffices to show irreparable harm, the Court finds that principle unavailing.  See Mot. at 25.  \n9  Even under that theory of irreparable harm, Plaintiffs must demonstrate some likely irreparable \n10  harm in the absence of a preliminary injunction barring the challenged action, and not simply a \n11  constitutional violation.  See id. (noting that the constitutional violation must be “coupled with the \n12  damages incurred,” which in that case involved “a good deal of economic harm in the interim”). \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Plaintiffs primary alternative theory of irreparable injury is that Defendants’ invocation of \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  and use of funds under Section 2808 for border barrier construction has harmed and continues to \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  harm Plaintiff SBCC and its member organizations’ ability to carry out their missions.  See Mot. at \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  23–25.  To this end, Plaintiffs describe that “several senior SBCC staff have devoted a ‘majority’ \nS d nr\nee 17  of their time to analyzing and responding to” Defendants’ invocation of Sections 2808 and 284.  \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Id. at 24.  Defendants acts purportedly have forced SBCC to “field[] inquiries from members, \n19  journalists and elected officials; create[] new educational materials, media toolkits and multimedia \n20  content; and host[] trainings for staff and partners.”  Id.  Tending to these activities has frustrated \n21  SBCC and its member organizations’ ability to focus on their “core missions.”  Id.  In Plaintiffs’ \n22  view, “[s]uch injuries are sufficient to demonstrate a likelihood of irreparable harm and justify \n23  preliminary injunctive relief.”  Id. \n24  But Plaintiffs conflate the type of harm to organizational mission that gives rise to Article \n25  III standing and the type of harm necessary for a preliminary injunction.  There is no dispute that \n26  the “perceptibl[e] impair[ment]” of an organization’s ability to carry out its mission that results in \n27  a “drain on the organization’s resources” is enough for Article III standing.  See Havens Realty \n28  Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 379 (1982).  But to warrant a preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs \n51 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 52 of 56\n \n1  must do more than just assert irreparable harm.  Winter commands that plaintiffs seeking a \n2  preliminary injunction establish that they are “likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \n3  preliminary relief.”  555 U.S. at 20 (emphasis added).  Plaintiffs ignore the “in the absence of \n4  preliminary relief” component, but Winter is not complicated on this point.  Under Winter, \n5  Plaintiffs must demonstrate that preliminary injunctive relief will prevent some irreparable injury \n6  that is likely to occur before the Court has time to decide the case on the merits.  In other words, \n7  Plaintiffs must present some persuasive counterfactual analysis showing a likelihood that \n8  irreparable harm would occur absent an injunction, but would not occur if an injunction is granted.  \n9  But as it stands, nothing indicates that Plaintiffs’ proffered “diversion” of funds or resources \n10  would change at all if the Court were to issue an injunction.  With or without an injunction, \n11  Plaintiffs will have to continue to litigate this case and otherwise divert resources in the manner \n12  they have described until the case is resolved. \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  All three cases on which Plaintiffs rely to support their mission-frustration theory support \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  the Court’s conclusion.  First, in Valle de Sol Inc. v. Whiting, plaintiffs faced a “credible threat of \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  prosecution” under an allegedly unconstitutional statute, where the resulting injury could not be \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  remedied by monetary damages.  732 F.3d 1006, 1029 (9th Cir. 2013).  But that is the \nS d nr\nee 17  quintessential sort of irreparable harm warranting an injunction.  See Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  123, 155–56 (1908) (“The various authorities we have referred to furnish ample justification for \n19  the assertion that individuals who, as officers of the state, are clothed with some duty in regard to \n20  the enforcement of the laws of the state, and who threaten and are about to commence \n21  proceedings, either of a civil or criminal nature, to enforce against parties affected an \n22  unconstitutional act, violating the Federal Constitution, may be enjoined by a Federal court of \n23  equity from such action.”).  Next, in East Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, the plaintiff \n24  organizations sufficiently demonstrated that they faced a substantial loss of funding in the absence \n25  of an injunction.  354 F. Supp. 3d 1094, 1116 (N.D. Cal. 2018); see also Cty. of Santa Clara v. \n26  Trump, 250 F. Supp. 3d 497, 537 (N.D. Cal. 2017) (“Without clarification regarding the Order’s \n27  scope or legality, the Counties will be obligated to take steps to mitigate the risk of losing millions \n28  of dollars in federal funding, which will include placing funds in reserve and making cuts to \n52 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 53 of 56\n \n1  services.”).  Finally, in League of Women Voters v. Newby, plaintiffs demonstrated that their \n2  mission interest in registering voters faced likely irreparable injury absent a preliminary injunction \n3  because registration deadlines would pass before resolution of the case on the merits.  838 F.3d 1, \n4  9 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (“Because, as a result of the Newby Decisions, those new obstacles \n5  unquestionably make it more difficult for the Leagues to accomplish their primary mission of \n6  registering voters, they provide injury for purposes both of standing and irreparable harm.  And \n7  that harm is irreparable because after the registration deadlines for the November election pass, \n8  there can be no do over and no redress.”) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \n9  In all three cases, a counterfactual existed which demonstrated the need for a preliminary \n10  injunction.  In Valle, injunctive relief meant the difference between prosecution under an \n11  unconstitutional statute or not.  In East Bay Sanctuary Covenant and County of Santa Clara, \n12  injunctive relief meant the difference between organizations losing substantial funding or not.  In \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  League of Women Voters, injunctive relief meant the difference between registering voters for an \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  election in keeping with organizations’ mission interests or not.  Here, however, Plaintiffs present \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  no evidence that injunctive relief will make any difference to the purported harm to their mission \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  interests, which will continue until this case’s resolution.  Plaintiffs thus have not carried their \nS d nr\nee 17  burden to show that the “extraordinary remedy” of a preliminary injunction is warranted in this \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  regard.  See Winter, 555 U.S. at 20. \n19  Although the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not yet met their burden of showing \n20  irreparable harm in the absence of a preliminary injunction, the Court fully expects that if and \n21  when Defendants identify border barrier construction locations where Section 2808 funds will be \n22  used, Plaintiffs will have the opportunity to submit materials in support of their irreparable harm \n23  claim.  The Court takes Defendants at their word that they “will inform the Court” immediately \n24  once a decision is made to use Section 2808 to fund border barrier construction.  See Dkt. No. 131 \n25  at 3. \n26  3.  Balance of Equities and Public Interest \n27  When the government is a party to a case in which a preliminary injunction is sought, the \n28  balance of the equities and public interest factors merge.  Drakes Bay Oyster Co. v. Jewell, 747 \n53 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 54 of 56\n \n1  F.3d 1073, 1092 (9th Cir. 2014).  According to Defendants, these factors tilt in their favor, \n2  because their “weighty” interest in border security and immigration-law enforcement, as \n3  sanctioned by Congress, outweighs Plaintiffs’ “speculative” injuries.  Opp. at 34–35.  The Ninth \n4  Circuit has recognized that “the public has a ‘weighty’ interest ‘in efficient administration of the \n5  immigration laws at the border,’” and the Court does not minimize this interest.  See E. Bay \n6  Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, 909 F.3d 1219, 1255 (9th Cir. 2018) (quoting Landon v. Plasencia, \n7  459 U.S. 21, 34 (1982)).  On the other hand, “the public also has an interest in ensuring that \n8  statutes enacted by their representatives are not imperiled by executive fiat.”  Id. (internal \n9  quotation marks and brackets omitted).  And the Court has found above that Plaintiffs’ injuries as \n10  to El Paso Sector Project 1 and Yuma Sector Project 1 are not speculative, and will be irreparable \n11  in the absence of an injunction.  Accordingly, this factor favors Plaintiffs, and counsels in favor of \n12  a preliminary injunction, to preserve the status quo until the merits of the case can be promptly \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  resolved.22 \nCfi\nt la\nciC 14  V.  CONCLUSION \nrts fo\niD tc 15  Congress’s “absolute” control over federal expenditures—even when that control may \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  frustrate the desires of the Executive Branch regarding initiatives it views as important—is not a \nS d nr\nee 17  bug in our constitutional system.  It is a feature of that system, and an essential one.  See FLRA, \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  665 F.3d at 1346–47 (“The power over the purse was one of the most important authorities \n19  allocated to Congress in the Constitution’s ‘necessary partition of power among the several \n20  departments.’”) (quoting The Federalist No. 51, at 320 (James Madison)).  The Appropriations \n21  Clause is “a bulwark of the Constitution’s separation of powers among the three branches of the \n22  National Government,” and is “particularly important as a restraint on Executive Branch officers.”  \n23  Id. at 1347.  In short, the position that when Congress declines the Executive’s request to \n24 \n                                                 \n25 \n22 The Court observes that, although Congress appropriated $1.571 billion for physical barriers \nand associated technology along the Southwest border for fiscal year 2018, counsel for the House \n26 \nhas represented to the Court that the Administration has stated as recently as April 30, 2019 that \nCBP represents it has only constructed 1.7 miles of fencing with that funding.  See Dkt. No. 139; \n27 \nsee also Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, Pub. L. No. 115-141, div. F, tit. II, § 230(a) 132 \nStat. 348 (2018).  This representation tends to undermine Defendants’ claim that irreparable harm \n28 \nwill result if the funds at issue on this motion are not deployed immediately. \n54 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 144   Filed 05/24/19   Page 55 of 56\n \n1  appropriate funds, the Executive nonetheless may simply find a way to spend those funds “without \n2  Congress” does not square with fundamental separation of powers principles dating back to the \n3  earliest days of our Republic.  See City & Cty of San Francisco, 897 F.3d at 1232 (“[I]f the \n4  decision to spend is determined by the Executive alone, without adequate control by the citizen’s \n5  Representatives in Congress, liberty is threatened.”) (internal quotation marks and brackets \n6  omitted) (quoting Clinton, 524 U.S. at 451) (Kennedy, J., concurring).  Justice Frankfurter wrote \n7  in 1952 that “[i]t is not a pleasant judicial duty to find that the President has exceeded his powers,” \n8  Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 614 (Frankfurter, J., concurring), and that remains no less true today.  \n9  But “if there is a separation-of-powers concern here, it is between the President and Congress, a \n10  boundary that [courts] are sometimes called upon to enforce.”  E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant, 909 \n11  F.3d at 1250; see also Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Mattis, 868 F.3d 803, 825–26 (9th Cir. \n12  2017) (“To declare that courts cannot even look to a statute passed by Congress to fulfill \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  international obligations turns on its head the role of the courts and our core respect for a co-equal \nCfi\nt la\ncC 14  political branch, Congress.”).  Because the Court has found that Plaintiffs are likely to show that \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Defendants’ actions exceeded their statutory authority, and that irreparable harm will result from \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  those actions, a preliminary injunction must issue pending a resolution of the merits of the case. \nS d nr\nee 17  For the foregoing reasons, the Court hereby GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  WITHOUT PREJUDICE Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.  The terms of the \n19  injunction are as follows23:  Defendants Patrick M. Shanahan, in his official capacity as Acting \n20  Secretary of Defense, Kevin K. McAleenan, in his official capacity as Acting Secretary of \n21  Homeland Security, Steven T. Mnuchin, in his official capacity as Secretary of the Department of \n22  the Treasury, and all persons acting under their direction, are enjoined from taking any action to \n23  construct a border barrier in the areas Defendants have identified as Yuma Sector Project 1 and El \n24  Paso Sector Project 1 using funds reprogrammed by DoD under Section 8005 of the Department \n25  of Defense Appropriations Act, 2019. \n26  A case management conference is set for June 5, 2019 at 2:00 p.m.  At the case \n27 \n                                                 \n23 The Court finds that an injunction against the President personally is not warranted here.

No. 146 (“Mot.”).  Defendants seek a stay of the Court’s May 24, 2019 \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  preliminary injunction order pending the outcome of their recently filed appeal to the United \ns ir\net\ntatsiD 16  States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  See Dkt. No. 144 (“Order”).  The Order enjoined \nS d nr\nee 17  Defendants from “taking any action to construct a border barrier in the areas Defendants have \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  identified as Yuma Sector Project 1 and El Paso Sector Project 1 using funds reprogrammed by \n19  DoD under Section 8005 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2019.”  Id. at 55.1 \n20  “A stay is not a matter of right, even if irreparable injury might otherwise result.”  Nken v. \n21  Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 433 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Instead, it is “an exercise of \n22  judicial discretion,” and “the propriety of its issue is dependent upon the circumstances of the \n23  particular case.”  Id. (internal quotation and alteration marks omitted).  The party seeking a stay \n24  bears the burden of justifying the exercise of that discretion.  Id. at 433–34. \n25 \n                                                 \n26 \n1 Reasonably, Defendants “request that the Court rule on this motion expeditiously,” without a \nresponse from Plaintiffs, and without oral argument, so that Defendants may promptly seek relief \n27 \nin the Ninth Circuit if the Court denies the motion to stay.  Mot. at 1.  The Court finds this matter \nappropriate for disposition without oral argument and the matter is deemed submitted.  See Civil \n28 \nL.R. 7-1(b).  The Court further finds that no response from Plaintiffs is necessary. \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 152   Filed 05/30/19   Page 2 of 2\n \n1  Whether to grant a stay pending appeal involves a similar inquiry as whether to issue a \n2  preliminary injunction.  Tribal Vill. of Akutan v. Hodel, 859 F.2d 662, 663 (9th Cir. 1988).  Courts \n3  consider four familiar factors:  “(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he \n4  is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a \n5  stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the \n6  proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.”  Nken, 556 U.S. at 434 (noting overlap with \n7  Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7 (2008)).  The first two factors “are \n8  the most critical.”  Id.   \n9  The Court will not stay its preliminary injunction order pending Defendants’ appeal.  The \n10  Court does not find that Defendants are likely to prevail on the merits of their appeal.  In granting \n11  the preliminary injunction, the Court rejected all of the arguments Defendants now advance \n12  regarding their intended use of funds reprogrammed by DoD under Section 8005, and found that \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Plaintiffs, not Defendants, were likely to succeed on the merits of their respective arguments.  The \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Court incorporates that reasoning here.  Moreover, Defendants’ request to proceed immediately \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  with the enjoined construction would not preserve the status quo pending resolution of the merits \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  of Plaintiffs’ claims, and would instead effectively moot those claims.  Finally, the Court \nS d nr\nee 17  continues to see no reason that the merits of this case cannot be resolved expeditiously, enabling \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  the parties to litigate a final judgment on appeal, rather than a preliminary injunction. \n19  For these reasons, the Court DENIES Defendants’ Motion to Stay.2  Defendants’ Motion \n20  to Shorten Time is TERMINATED AS MOOT.

The district court injunction permanently enjoined spending funds under\n10 U.S.C. § 2808 for eleven specified border barrier construction projects, but the\ndistrict court stayed the injunction pending appeal.

The district court in\nthe Western District of Texas has issued a substantially similar injunction\nprecluding using § 2808 funds beyond what Congress has otherwise appropriated\nfor border wall construction.  See El Paso Cty v. Trump, No. EP-19-CV-66-DB\n(W.D. Tex. Dec. 10, 2019).  In addition, the Supreme Court has already stayed an\ninjunction previously granted by the district court in this case.

As the district court concluded, “the Supreme Court’s\nstay of this Court’s prior injunction order appears to reflect the conclusion of a\nmajority of that Court that the challenged construction should be permitted to\nproceed pending resolution of the merits.”  Sierra Club v.

Given the existence of a spending\ninjunction and the Supreme Court’s stay order, we decline to reverse the district\ncourt’s grant of a stay pending appeal at this time, without prejudice to renewal or\nreconsideration pending further developments.

The House has a compelling institutional interest in this \n \n4 \n \n  suit, which seeks to enjoin the Administration from spending federal funds without a valid \n5 \n \n  Congressional appropriation and, indeed, in defiance of a clear Congressional refusal to appropriate \n6 \n \n  funds in excess of $1.35 billion for a border wall.1   \n7 \n \n \n8  The Appropriations Clause of the Constitution, U.S. Const., Art. I, § 9, cl. 7, vests Congress \n \n \n9    with “exclusive power over the federal purse,” and is “one of the  most important authorities \n10 \nallocated to Congress in the Constitution’s ‘necessary partition of power among the several \n11 \ndepartments.’”  U.S. Dep’t of the Navy v. FLRA, 665 F.3d 1339, 1346 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (quoting \n12 \nThe Federalist No. 51, at 320 (James Madison) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961)).  Notwithstanding this \n13 \nbedrock  constitutional  principle,  the  Administration  seeks  to  invoke  inapposite  general \n14 \nappropriations authorities to circumvent Congress’s rejection of President Trump’s demand for $5 \n15 \n16  billion for a border wall.  As President Trump recently stated, “we’re taking money from all over \n17  because as you know the Democrats don’t want us to build the wall.”2 \n18 \nSpecifically, plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment concerns the Administration’s \n19 \nreprogramming of $3.6 billion from Department of Defense (DOD) military construction projects \n20 \nto border wall construction under 10 U.S.C. § 2808.  As demonstrated below and in plaintiffs’ \n21 \nfilings, the Administration’s invocation of Section 2808 in defense of its unconstitutional spending \n22 \n23  on the border wall fails.3  Most importantly, Section 2808 does not authorize spending that \n24 \n                                                           \n1  No counsel for a party authored this brief in whole or in part, and no person other than \n25  amicus curiae and its counsel made a monetary contribution to its preparation or submission.   \n2 The White House, A Message from President Trump on the Border Wall, YouTube (Sept. \n26  9, 2019), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fEdhud7RJI. \n3  The House fully supports plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief in this case.  The House \n27  has focused this brief on the Appropriations Clause issues of greatest concern to the House and \ndoes not address all of the arguments raised by plaintiffs to avoid burdening the Court with \n28  repetitive briefing. \n \n     \nBRIEF OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AS AMICUS CURIAE (4:19-cv-00892-HSG) \n1 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 230   Filed 10/22/19   Page 7 of 21\n \n \n \n \n1    Congress has blatantly refused to provide.  And, in any event, Section 2808 only authorizes the \n \n2 \n  reprogramming  of  military  construction  funds  subject  to  specific  requirements,  which  the \n \n3 \n   \nAdministration has not met here.  \n \n4 \n \n  This Court should grant summary judgment to plaintiffs on their claims with respect to \n5 \n \n  expenditures  the  Administration  purports  to  make  under  Section  2808  and  forbid  the \n6 \n \n \nAdministration from spending funds under Section 2808 on the construction of a border wall.   \n7 \n \n \n8  BACKGROUND \n \n \n9    This dispute grew directly out of the pitched battle that the Pre sident and Congress waged \n10 \nover the subject of this litigation—funding for a border wall.  Although the President originally \n11 \nrequested “$1.6 billion to construct approximately 65 miles of border wall,”4 by the middle of 2018, \n12 \nhe was “press[ing] Republicans to give him $5 billion as a down payment on his wall.”5  Near the \n13 \nend of the 115th Congress, he and Congress faced an impasse on the issue.  \n14 \nIn December 2018, President Trump held a televised meeting with then-House Minority \n15 \n16  Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, to negotiate fiscal year 2019 \n17  appropriations for a border wall.6  During that meeting, the President reiterated his demand for $5 \n18 \nbillion for a border wall.  He also warned that “[i]f we don’t get what we want one way or the other, \n19 \nwhether it’s through you, through a military, through anything you want to call it, I will shut down \n20 \nthe government.”7 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n                                                           \n4  Office of Mgmt. & Budget, Fiscal Year 2019: Efficient, Effective, Accountable: An \n24 \nAmerican Budget: Budget of the U.S. Government 58 (2018), https://perma.cc/MD3C-62YP. \n5  Rachael Bade, Immigration Storm Bears Down on Republicans, Politico (July 2, 2018), \n25 \nhttps://perma.cc/D8LJ-DLTK; see also Letter from Russell T.

More than two weeks later, President Trump addressed \n \n3 \n   \nthe nation from the Oval Office, imploring Congress to “do[] its job” and “pass a bill that ends this \n \n4 \n \n  crisis.”8  Congress still refused to appropriate the funds he sought for the border wall, and on \n5 \n \n  January 25, 2019, President Trump signed a continuing resolution to fund the Government through \n6 \n \n  February 14, 2019.9  Over the next several weeks, a bipartisan conference committee negotiated a \n7 \n \n \n8  deal to fund the government.  While those negotiations were underway, the Acting White House \n \n \n9    Chief of Staff stated that the southern border wall “is going to get built, w  ith or without Congress.”10 \n10 \nUltimately, Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, Pub L. No. 116-\n11 \n6, 133 Stat. 13 (CAA), which appropriated only $1.375 billion for construction of fencing in the \n12 \nRio Grande Valley area of the border.  Id. § 230, 133 Stat. at 28.  On February 15, 2019, President \n13 \nTrump signed the CAA into law.11  That same day, however, he expressed dissatisfaction with the \n14 \nappropriation for border wall construction and announced that his Administration would instead \n15 \n16  spend up to $8.1 billion for that purpose.12  \n17 \nThe White House stated that it would draw funding from three sources to supplement the \n18 \namount appropriated by Congress: \n19 \n•  About $601 million from the Treasury Forfeiture Fund \n20  •  Up to $2.5 billion under the Department of Defense funds transferred for Support for \nCounterdrug Activities (Title 10 United States Code, section 284) \n21 \n22 \n                                                           \n23 \n8  Full Transcripts: Trump’s Speech on Immigration and the Democratic Response, N.Y. \nTimes (Jan. 8, 2019), https://perma.cc/UJ6C-VZ37. \n24 \n9  See Further Additional Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019, Pub.

To \nprovide additional authority to the Department of Defense to support the Federal \n13 \nGovernment’s response to the emergency at the southern border, I hereby declare \nthat this emergency requires use of the Armed Forces and, in accordance with \n14 \nsection 301 of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1631), that the construction \nauthority provided in section 2808 of title 10, United States Code, is invoked and \n15 \nmade available, according to its terms, to the Secretary of Defense and, at the \n16  discretion  of  the  Secretary  of  Defense,  to  the  Secretaries  of  the  military \ndepartments.15  \n17 \nThe House is unaware of any other instance in American history where a President has declared a \n18 \nnational emergency to obtain funding after having failed to win Congressional approval for an \n19 \n20  appropriation.16  \n21  The  President’s  proclamation  outlines  the  asserted  basis  for  the  national  emergency \n22 \ndeclaration.

I made a deal.  I \n13 \ngot almost $1.4 billion when I wasn’t supposed to get one dollar—not one dollar.  ‘He’s not going \n14 \nto get one dollar.’  Well, I got $1.4 billion.  But I’m not happy with it.”23  \n15 \n16  Reiterating that he was “successful” in getting Democrats to appropriate funding for the \n17 \nwall, President Trump explained why he nevertheless declared a national emergency: “So I did—I \n18 \nwas successful, in that sense, but I want to do it faster.  I could do the wall over a longer period of \n19 \ntime.  I didn’t need to do this.  But I’d rather do it much faster . . . And I think that I just want to \n20 \nget it done faster, that’s all.24 \n21 \n22 \n                                                           \n23 \n17  See National Emergency Proclamation, https://perma.cc/7SHF-Z2XL.  \n18  Id.   \n24 \n19  Remarks by President Trump on the National Security and Humanitarian Crisis on Our \nSouthern  Border,  White  House  (Feb.  15,  2019)  (Feb.  15  Rose  Garden  Remarks), \n25 \nhttps://perma.cc/5SE7-FS7F. \n20  Id.   \n26 \n21  Id.   \n22  Id.   \n27 \n23  Id.   \n24  Id.  \n28 \n \n \n     \nBRIEF OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AS AMICUS CURIAE (4:19-cv-00892-HSG) \n5 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 230   Filed 10/22/19   Page 11 of 21\n \n \n \n \n1    Congress swiftly rebuked President Trump’s decision to declare a national emergency at \n \n2 \n  the southern border and spend in excess of what Congress had appropriated on the construction of \n \n3 \n   \na border wall.  On February 26, 2019, the House adopted House Joint Resolution 46 by a vote of \n \n4 \n \n  245 to 182, terminating President Trump’s national emergency declaration pursuant to section 202 \n5 \n \n  of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. § 1622.25  On March 14, 2019, the Senate passed the \n6 \n \n  joint resolution by a vote of 59 to 41.26  The joint resolution was supported by numerous \n7 \n \n \n8  Republicans, such as Senator Mitt Romney, who stated that his vote of disapproval was “a vote for \n \n \n9    the Constitution and for the balance of powers that is at its core.”27  P resident Trump vetoed the \n10 \njoint resolution on March 15, 2019.28 \n11 \nThe Administration has since then taken various steps to advance construction of the wall, \n12 \nand most recently it authorized eleven border wall projects in California, Arizona, New Mexico \n13 \nand Texas pursuant to Section 2808.29  The Secretary of Defense stated that these eleven projects \n14 \n“are necessary to support the use of the armed forces in connection with the national emergency.”30  \n15 \n16  He asserted that the projects “will deter illegal entry, increase the vanishing time of those illegally \n17  crossing the border, and channel migrants to ports of entry.”31  In his view, this would “reduce the \n18 \ndemand for DoD personnel and assets at the locations where the barriers are constructed and allow \n19 \nthe redeployment of DoD personnel and assets to other high-traffic areas on the border without \n20 \n21 \n                                                           \n22 \n25  165 Cong.

Defendants Have Violated the Appropriations Clause. \n7 \n \n \nPlaintiffs have asserted a constitutional claim under the Appropriations Clause.  As the \n8 \n \n \n9    history recited above makes clear, Congress rejected President Trump’ s request for over $5 billion \n10 \nfor  a  border  wall,  but  the  Administration  nonetheless  decided  to  build  the  wall  “without \n11 \nCongress.” 33    This  decision  violates  the  Appropriations  Clause,  which  dictates  that  the \n12 \nAdministration may spend funds—including to build a border wall—only if, and to the extent that, \n13 \nCongress appropriates funds for that purpose.  See, e.g., Reeside v. Walker, 52 U.S. (11 How.) 272, \n14 \n291 (1850) (“It is a well-known constitutional provision, that no money can be taken or drawn from \n15 \n16  the Treasury except under an appropriation by Congress.”).   \n17  Having precipitated the longest government shutdown in history because Congress would \n18 \nnot appropriate the amount of funds it wanted for a border wall, the Administration now claims to \n19 \nhave found “secreted in the interstices of legislation the very grant of power which Congress \n20 \nconsciously withheld.”  Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 609 (1952) \n21 \n(Frankfurter, J., concurring).  As relevant here, the Administration relies on Section 2808.  But this \n22 \nstatute  does  not  authorize  spending  in  excess  of  the  funds  that  Congress  has  appropriated, \n23 \n24  particularly where, as here, Congress has denied additional expenditures for a particular purpose. \n25 \n26 \n                                                           \n27  32  Id. \n33 Andrew O’Reilly, Mulvaney Says Border Wall Will Get Built, ‘With or Without’ Funding \n28  from Congress, Fox News (Feb. 10, 2019), https://perma.cc/NGM3-2FML. \n \n     \nBRIEF OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AS AMICUS CURIAE (4:19-cv-00892-HSG) \n7 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 230   Filed 10/22/19   Page 13 of 21\n \n \n \n \n1    II.  Section 2808 Does Not Allow Defendants to Spend More on a Border Wall \n  than Congress Appropriated.   \n2 \n \n \nDefendants are not authorized to spend federal funds on the construction of a border wall \n3 \n   \n \n4  under Section 2808.  As this Court correctly recognized, “[u]nder the circumstances, it is unclear \n \n \n5    how border barrier construction could reasonably constitute a ‘military construction project’ such \n \n6 \n  that Defendants’ invocation of Section 2808 would be lawful.”  Sierra Club v. Trump, 379 F. Supp. \n \n7 \n \n3d 883, 919 (N.D. Cal. 2019); see id. at 921 (expressing “concern[] with Defendants’ arguments” \n \n8 \n \n  on Section 2808 but determining at that time that plaintiffs had not shown irreparable harm because \n9 \n   \nthe Section 2808 construction project locations had not yet been specified).   \n10 \nSection 2808 provides: \n11 \n12  In the event of a declaration of war or the declaration by the President of a national \nemergency in accordance with the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) that \n13 \nrequires use of the armed forces, the Secretary of Defense, without regard to any other \nprovision of law, may undertake military construction projects, and may authorize the \n14 \nSecretaries of the military departments to undertake military construction projects, not \n15  otherwise authorized by law that are necessary to support such use of the armed forces. \nSuch projects may be undertaken only within the total amount of funds that have been \n16  appropriated for military construction, including funds appropriated for family housing, \nthat have not been obligated. \n17 \n10 U.S.C. § 2808(a).  Section 2808(a) thus authorizes the Secretary of Defense to redirect \n18 \nunobligated military construction funds to other projects subject to three specific limitations: \n19 \n20  (1) there must be a national emergency “that requires use of the armed forces,” (2) the funding must \n21 \nbe spent on a “military construction project[],” and (3) the project must be “necessary to support \n22 \n[the] use of the armed forces.”  Id.  \n23 \n1.  In order to transfer funds under Section 2808, there must be a national emergency that \n24 \n“requires the use of the armed forces”—not simply use of the armed forces’ money.  There is no \n25 \nsuch national emergency here.   \n26 \n27  Border security is a matter for domestic law enforcement, specifically DHS and Customs \n28  and Border Patrol (CBP).  See 6 U.S.C. § 202.  CBP is the “largest federal law enforcement agency \n \n     \nBRIEF OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AS AMICUS CURIAE (4:19-cv-00892-HSG) \n8 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 230   Filed 10/22/19   Page 14 of 21\n \n \n \n \n1    in  the  United  States,”  and  its  mission  is  to  “safeguard  America’s  borders.”34   Indeed,  the \n \n2 \n  Administration recognized this fact when it used $601 million from the Treasury Forfeiture Fund35 \n \n3 \n   \nto construct a border wall, because money from this fund can be applied only to “law enforcement \n \n4 \n \n  activities.”  31 U.S.C. § 9705 (g)(4)(B).  Moreover, the military is expressly prohibited from \n5 \n \n  making “direct active use of Federal troops” to execute domestic law under the Posse Comitatus \n6 \n \n \nAct, 18 U.S.C. § 1385.  See also United States v. Dreyer¸ 804 F.3d 1266, 1272 (9th Cir. 2015).  The \n7 \n \n \n8  Administration has made no showing that armed forces are “required” to address the described \n \n \n9    “emergency.”  Indeed, the then-Acting Secretary of Defense has acknow  ledged that the situation at \n10 \nthe border does not constitute “a military threat,”36 and another top-level defense official has \n11 \ntestified that “[n]one of the capabilities that we are providing [at the southern border] are combat \n12 \ncapabilities.”37   \n13 \nPresident Trump’s proclamation asserts that the situation at the border has “worsened” due \n14 \nto “sharp increases in the number of family units entering and seeking entry to the United States \n15 \n16  and an inability to provide detention space.”38  But this trend has long been apparent,39 and the \n17 \nhumanitarian and other issues it raises are a matter for domestic law enforcement, not the armed \n18 \nforces.  And there is no argument that the circumstances at the border require even the use of DOD \n19 \nmoney (as distinct from armed forces personnel):  The President has stated that the Democrats \n20 \nappropriated for border security “so much money, we don’t know what to do with it.”40 \n21 \n22 \n                                                           \n34 See, e.g., Snapshot; A Summary of CBP Facts and Figures, U.S. Customs & Border \n23  Protection (Dec. 2018), https://perma.cc/H3JS-PH9C. \n35  See Border Victory Fact Sheet, https://perma.cc/77SZ-GA4E. \n24  36  Department of Defense Budget Posture: Hearing Before the S.

It requires, if anything, enhanced domestic law \n \n3 \n   \nenforcement.  As President Trump admits, Congress has appropriated a “crazy” amount of money \n \n4 \n \n  for this purpose.  Congress has simply chosen to allocate most of that money to border security \n5 \n \n  activities that do not include construction of a border wall.  The Administration cannot plausibly \n6 \n \n \nclaim that the armed forces are nevertheless “required” so that DOD can build a wall that Congress \n7 \n \n \n8  deemed unnecessary.   \n \n \n9    2.  In any event, a border wall is not a “military construction pro ject” as that term is defined \n10 \nby statute.  Section 2801(a) defines “military construction” as “any construction, development, \n11 \nconversion, or extension of any kind carried out with respect to a military installation.”  A “military \n12 \ninstallation,” in turn, is “a base, camp, post, station, yard, center, or other activity under the \n13 \njurisdiction of the Secretary of a military department.”  10 U.S. C. § 2801(c)(4); see id. § 2801(b) \n14 \n(“military construction project” includes “all military construction work . . . necessary to produce \n15 \n16  a complete and usable facility or a complete and usable improvement to an existing facility”).   \n17 \nThe Administration’s border wall projects do not constitute “military construction” because, \n18 \nwith the exception of two projects on the Barry M. Goldwater Range, the border wall projects are \n19 \nnot being “carried out with respect to a military installation.”  Simply put, the southern border is \n20 \nnot a militarized zone.  It is the responsibility of DHS and CBP to ensure border security, not DOD.  \n21 \nSee supra at 9.  Indeed, the Administration has previously invoked 10 U.S.C. § 8005 as a source of \n22 \n23  transfer authority to transfer DOD funds for purposes of other border wall projects, and that section \n24  prohibits transfers for purposes of “military construction.”  See Brief of the U.S. House of \n25 \nRepresentatives as Amicus Curiae in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction at \n26 \n2-3, 11, Sierra Club v.

Trump, \n7 \n \n \n8  No. 4:19-cv-00892 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 16, 2019), ECF No. 206 (Administrative Record), Part 1 at 3.  \n \n \n9    But even if these land acquisitions were valid, they do not transfor m the planned border wall \n10 \nconstruction into military construction projects.  As explained, a “military installation,” is defined \n11 \nto mean “a base, camp, post, station, yard, center, or other activity under the jurisdiction of the \n12 \nSecretary of a military department.”  10 U.S.C. § 2801(c)(4).  The border lands at issue here are \n13 \nplainly not military bases, posts, stations, yards or centers—regardless of whether they are owned \n14 \nby DOD.  See Sierra Club, 379 F. Supp. 3d at 920 (“Defendants make no attempt to characterize \n15 \n16  the U.S.-Mexico border or a border barrier as a ‘base, camp, post, station, yard, [or] center.’  Nor \n17 \ncould they.” (emphasis added)).  And, as this Court has correctly noted, “Section 2801 likely \n18 \nprecludes treating the southern border as an ‘other activity.’”  Id. \n19 \n“The term ‘other activity’ appears after a list of closely related types of discrete and \n20 \ntraditional military locations: ‘a base, camp, post, station, yard, [and] center.’”  Id. at 921; see \n21 \nCircuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U.S. 105, 114-15 (2001) (“[W]here general words follow \n22 \n23  specific words in a statutory enumeration, the general words are construed to embrace only objects \n24  similar in nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding specific words.”  (quotation marks \n25 \nomitted)).  “Had Congress intended for ‘other activity’ in Section 2801(c)(4) to be so broad as to \n26 \ntransform literally any activity conducted by a Secretary of a military department into a ‘military \n27 \ninstallation,’ there would have been no reason to include a list of specific, discrete military \n28 \n \n     \nBRIEF OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AS AMICUS CURIAE (4:19-cv-00892-HSG) \n11 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 230   Filed 10/22/19   Page 17 of 21\n \n \n \n \n1    locations.”  Sierra Club, 379 F. Supp. 3d at 921.  As this Court explained, “[i]t is thus proper to \n \n2 \n  construe ‘other activity’ as referring to similar discrete and traditional military locations.”  Id.  It \n \n3 \n   \nremains difficult to “see how the U.S.-Mexico border could fit this bill.”  Id.  The administrative \n \n4 \n \n  record does not suggest that troops are stationed on the land where the border wall projects will be \n5 \n \n  built or that such land is otherwise in use as a military post, station, yard, or center, or other similar \n6 \n \n \nmilitary location.  Simply put, “in context and with an eye toward the overall statutory scheme, \n7 \n \n \n8  nothing demonstrates that Congress ever contemplated that ‘other activity’ has such an unbounded \n \n \n9    reading that it would authorize Defendants to invoke Section 2808 to bu ild a barrier on the southern \n10 \nborder.”  Id. \n11 \nFinally, accepting the Administration’s argument that “military construction projects” \n12 \nshould include land that DOD is acquiring for the purpose of constructing a border wall and \n13 \nconstruction of that wall for use by the Customs and Border Patrol—not the military—circumvents \n14 \nthe prohibitions of Section 2808 and does not represent a good faith reading of the statute’s \n15 \n16  requirements.  The House is aware of no prior use of Section 2808 funds for a construction project \n17  that will not be used by the military.41  Using Section 2808 funds to obtain land for DOD to \n18 \npurportedly create new military installations to build facilities that will be used for non-military \n19 \npurposes is inconsistent with the intent of Section 2808, and in clear defiance of Section 2808’s \n20 \nlimitation “to construction related to a military installation”—i.e., construction on “types of discrete \n21 \nand traditional military locations.”  Sierra Club, 379 F.

A border wall is not “necessary to support [the] use of the armed forces.”  DHS describes \n \n2 \n  its mission as “gain[ing], maintain[ing], and expand[ing] operational control of the U.S. Border \n \n3 \n   \nbetween ports of entry,” and views border barriers as a “critical capability[y]” to achieve this \n \n4 \n \n  mission.42  Over the past year and a half, the President has ordered a few thousand troops to assist \n5 \n \n  the DHS and the CBP at the border.  Consistent with the Posse Comitatus Act, however, troops are \n6 \n \n \nlimited to “support roles that relieve DHS personnel of non-law enforcement duties (e.g., logistics, \n7 \n \n \n8  planning, and intelligence analysis) or that provide monitoring and detection support (i.e., operating \n \n \n9    mobile surveillance camera units or providing aerial reconnaissance).” 43 \n10 \nWhile DOD has asserted that a border wall is “necessary” to support the troops because it \n11 \n“will reduce the demand” for the troops at barrier locations,44 this assertion falls far short of \n12 \ndemonstrating that the border wall is necessary to support the use of the armed forces.  It is, at best, \n13 \nan argument that a border wall will reduce the need for domestic law enforcement at the border.  \n14 \nPut differently, the fact that the border wall will make it easier for DHS and CBP to do their jobs—\n15 \n16  and potentially reduce or change the way that DOD back-up is used—does not mean that the wall \n17 \nis “necessary to support [the] use of the armed forces.”  The relationship between the wall and the \n18 \n“armed forces” is too indirect and attenuated to satisfy this standard of necessity.   \n19 \n *  *  *   \n20 \nThe Administration’s expenditure of Section 2808 funds defies the mandate of Congress \n21 \nand infringes on the Congressional power of the purse.  This Court should not “stretch th[e] words \n22 \n23  [of Section 2808’s three prerequisites] beyond their normal meaning to give legal cover to the \n24  Administration’s transgression.”  Schneider v.

Section 2808 is one \n25 \n26 \n                                                           \n42  Administrative Record, Part 1 at 42, 54. \n27 \n43  Id., Part 1 at 42.  \n44  Id., Part 1 at 47. \n28 \n \n \n     \nBRIEF OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AS AMICUS CURIAE (4:19-cv-00892-HSG) \n13 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-00892-HSG   Document 230   Filed 10/22/19   Page 19 of 21\n \n \n \n \n1    of the scores of statutes that the President may invoke by declaring a national emergency under the \n \n2 \n  National Emergencies Act.45  The National Emergencies Act was “not intended to grant additional \n \n3 \n   \nauthority to the President,” but instead to make clear that “[t]he President can only exercise those \n \n4 \n \n  powers delegated to him in other statutes.”46  Section 2808 thus limits the circumstances and \n5 \n \n  manner in which the President can exercise this transfer authority.  If courts fail to enforce these \n6 \n \n \nlimits, as a practical matter, the President’s emergency authority will be unbounded.   \n7 \n \n \n8  Indeed, accepting the Administration’s interpretation of Section 2808 and other purported \n \n \n9    authorities for the transfer of DOD funds would transform the shutdow n of the federal government \n10 \ninto mere political theater.  The Administration would have known when 2019 DOD appropriations \n11 \nwere passed on September 28, 2018, see Pub. L. No. 115-245, 132 Stat. 2981, that DOD could \n12 \ntransfer billions of dollars in wall funding under the provisions it has now invoked.  If, as the \n13 \nAdministration claims, it possessed the authority after September 2018 to transfer these funds for \n14 \nborder wall construction, it surely would not have precipitated the longest government shutdown \n15 \n16  in history because Congress refused to appropriate the money it requested for that purpose.  The \n17 \nAdministration’s actions at the end of last year speak far louder than its arguments before this Court \n18 \nnow.  \n19 \nThis Court should hold that the Administration’s expenditure of up to $3.6 billion under \n20 \nSection 2808 for border wall construction violates the Appropriations Clause and is otherwise \n21 \nunauthorized.  \n22 \n23  CONCLUSION \n24  For the foregoing reasons, plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment should be \n25 \ngranted.    \n26 \n                                                           \n27  45 See  A  Guide  to  Federal  Emergency  Powers  and  Their  Use,  Brennan  Ctr.

TRUMP\nBefore:  Sidney R. Thomas, Chief Judge, and Kim McLane\nWardlaw and Daniel P. Collins, Circuit Judges.\nOpinion by Chief Judge Thomas;\nDissent by Judge Collins\nSUMMARY*\nAppropriations\nThe panel affirmed the district court’s judgment in an\naction brought by the Sierra Club and the Southern Border\nCommunities  Coalition  (collectively  the  “Sierra  Club”)\nchallenging the Department of Defense’s budgetary transfers\nto fund construction of a wall on the southern border of the\nUnited States in California, New Mexico, and Arizona.\nAt issue is whether Section 8005 and Section 9002 of the\nDepartment of Defense Appropriations Act of 2019 (“Section\n8005”)  authorized  the  budgetary  transfers  to  fund\nconstruction of the wall.\nThe  panel  held  that  the  Sierra  Club  had  Article  III\nstanding to pursue its claims.  Specifically, the panel held that\nSierra Club’s thousands of members live near and frequently\nvisit  areas  along  the  U.S.-Mexico  border  for  hiking,\nbirdwatching, photography, and other professional, scientific,\nrecreational, and aesthetic activities; and construction of a\nborder wall and related infrastructure will acutely injure these\n* This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court.

TRUMP 3\ninterests because the Department of Homeland Security is\nproceeding with border wall construction without ensuring\ncompliance  with  any  federal  or  state  environmental\nregulations designed to protect these interests.  Additionally, \nthe interests of Sierra Club’s members in the lawsuit are\ngermane to the organization’s purpose.  Similarly, the panel\nheld that the Southern Border Communities Coalition alleged\nfacts that support that it had standing to sue on behalf of itself\nand its member organizations.  The panel further held that\nSierra Club’s injuries were fairly traceable to the Section\n8005 transfers.  In addition, the panel held that the injury to\nSierra Club members and Southern Border Communities\nCoalition was likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial\ndecision. \nIn companion appeal State of California v. Trump, Nos.\n19-16299 and 19-16336, slip op. (9th Cir. June 26, 2020)\n(published concurrently), the panel held that Section 8005 did\nnot authorize the transfers of funds at issue here.  The panel\nreaffirmed this holding here.\nThe  panel  held  that  the  Executive  Branch  lacked\nindependent constitutional authority to authorize the transfer\nof funds.  The panel noted that the Appropriations Clause of\nthe U.S. Constitution exclusively grants the power of the\npurse to Congress.  The panel held that the transfer of funds\nviolated  the  Appropriations  Clause,  and,  therefore,  was\nunlawful.   \nThe panel held that the Sierra Club was a proper party to\nchallenge the Section 8005 transfers, and concluded that\nSierra Club had both a constitutional and an ultra vires cause\nof action.  First, the panel held that where plaintiffs, like\nSierra Club, establish that they satisfy the requirements of\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  44  ooff  8822\n4 SIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP\nArticle III standing, they may invoke separation of powers\nconstraints,  like  the  Appropriations  Clause,  to  challenge\nagency spending in excess of its delegated authority.  Because\nthe federal defendants not only exceeded their delegated\nauthority,  but  also  violated  an  express  constitutional\nprohibition designed to protect individual liberties, the panel\nheld that Sierra Club had a constitutional cause of action.\nSecond, the panel held that the Sierra Club had an equitable\nultra vires cause of action to challenge the Department of\nDefense’s transfer of funds.  Where it is alleged that the\nDepartment of Defense has exceeded the statutory authority\ndelegated by Section 8005, plaintiffs like Sierra Club can\nchallenge this agency action.\nThe panel rejected the federal defendants’ additional\narguments. First, the federal defendants asserted that Sierra\nClub’s challenge must be construed as an Administrative\nProcedure Act (“APA”) claim, rather than as a constitutional\nor ultra vivres cause of action.  The panel held that the APA\nis not to be construed as an exclusive remedy, and the APA\ndoes not displace all constitutional and equitable causes of\naction.  Second, the federal defendants asserted that the zone\nof interests test must apply to any challenge brought by\nSierra Club, and that Section 8005 prescribes the relevant\nzone of interests.  The panel held that Sierra Club fell within\nthe  Appropriations  Clause’s  zone  of  interests.    The\nunconstitutional  transfer  of  funds  here  infringed  upon\nSierra  Club’s  members’  liberty  interests,  harming  their\nenvironmental, aesthetic, and recreational interests.  The\npanel concluded that the Sierra Club had a cause of action to\nchallenge the transfers.\nFinally, the panel held that the district court did not abuse\nits discretion in granting Sierra Club a permanent injunction\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  55  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP 5\nenjoining the federal defendants from spending the funds at\nissue.  First, the panel agreed with the district court that Sierra\nClub would suffer irreparable harm to its recreational and\naesthetic  interests  absent  injunction.    Second,  the  panel\nagreed with the district court that the balance of equities and\nthe public interest favored injunctive relief.  The panel held\nthat the Supreme Court’s decision in Winter v. NRDC, Inc.,\n555 U.S. 7 (2008), did not require the panel to vacate the\ninjunction.  \nJudge Collins dissented.  He agreed that at least the Sierra\nClub established Article III standing, but in his view the\norganizations lacked any cause of action to challenge the\ntransfers.  Even assuming that they had a cause of action\nJudge Collins would conclude that the transfers were lawful. \nAccordingly, he would reverse the district court’s partial\nsummary judgment for the organizations and remand for an\nentry of partial summary judgment in favor of the defendants.\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  66  ooff  8822\n6 SIERRA CLUB V.

TRUMP 9\nOPINION\nTHOMAS, Chief Judge:\nWe consider in this appeal challenges by the Sierra Club\nand the Southern Border Communities Coalition (“SBCC”)1\nto the Department of Defense’s budgetary transfers to fund\nconstruction of the wall on the southern border of the United\nStates in California, New Mexico, and Arizona.  Specifically,\nwe consider whether Section 8005 and Section 9002 of the\nDepartment of Defense Appropriations Act of 2019, Pub. L.\nNo.  115-245,  132  Stat.  2981  (2018)  (“Section  8005”)2\nauthorized the budgetary transfers.  In a companion appeal,\nState of California, et al. v. Trump et al., Nos. 19-16299 and\n19-16336,  we  considered  similar  challenges  filed  by  a\ncollective group of States.  However, because Sierra Club\nasserts different legal theories, and this case, when presented,\nwas in a different procedural posture, we treat this appeal\nseparately.    We  conclude  that  the    transfers  were  not\nauthorized, and that plaintiffs have a cause of action.  We\naffirm the judgment of the district court.\n1 We refer throughout this opinion to Sierra Club and SBCC together\nas “Sierra Club,” unless otherwise noted.\n2 For simplicity, because the transfer authorities are both subject to\nSection 8005’s substantive requirements, this opinion refers to these\nauthorities collectively as Section 8005, as did the district court and the\nmotions panel.  Our holding in this case therefore extends to both the\ntransfer of funds pursuant to Section 8005 and Section 9002.\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  1100  ooff  8822\n10 SIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP\nI\nWe  recounted  the  essential  underlying  facts  in  the\ncompanion case.  However, we briefly outline them here for\nconvenience of reference.\nThe President has long supported the construction of a\nborder wall on the southern border between the United States\nand  Mexico.    Since  the  President  took  office  in  2017,\nhowever, Congress has repeatedly declined to provide the\namount of funding requested by the President.\nThe debate over border wall funding came to a head in\nDecember  of  2018.    During  negotiations  to  pass  an\nappropriations bill for the remainder of the fiscal year, the\nPresident announced that he would not sign any legislation\nthat  did  not  allocate  substantial  funds  to  border  wall\nconstruction.  On January 6, 2019, the White House requested\n$5.7  billion  to  fund  the  construction  of  approximately\n234 miles of new physical barrier.3  Budget negotiations\nconcerning  border  wall  funding  reached  an  impasse,\ntriggering the longest partial government shutdown in United\nStates history.\nAfter 35 days, the government shutdown ended without\nan agreement to provide increased border wall funding in the\namount requested by the President.  On February 14, 2019,\nCongress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of\n2019 (“CAA”), which included the Department of Homeland\nSecurity Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2019, Pub. L.\n3 Some form of a physical barrier already exists at the site of some of\nthe construction projects.  In those places, construction would reinforce or\nrebuild the existing portions.\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  1111  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V.

The  CAA\nappropriated only $1.375 billion for border wall construction,\nspecifying that the funding was for “the construction of\nprimary pedestrian fencing . . . in the Rio Grande Valley\nSector.”  Id. § 230(a)(1).  The President signed the CAA into\nlaw the following day.\nThe President concurrently issued a proclamation under\nthe National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. §§ 1601–1651,\n“declar[ing] that a national emergency exists at the southern\nborder  of  the  United  States.”    Proclamation  No.  9,844,\n84 Fed. Reg. 4949 (Feb. 15, 2019).4  An accompanying White\nHouse Fact Sheet explained that the President was “using his\nlegal authority to take Executive action to secure additional\nresources” to build a border wall, and it specified that “the\nAdministration [had] so far identified up to $8.1 billion that\n[would] be available to build the border wall once a national\nemergency  [was]  declared  and  additional  funds  [were]\nreprogrammed.”  The Fact Sheet identified several funding\nsources, including $2.5 billion of Department of Defense\n(“DoD”) funds that could be transferred to provide support\nfor  counterdrug  activities  of  other  federal  government\nagencies under 10 U.S.C. § 284 (“Section 284”).5  Executive\n4 Subsequently, Congress adopted two joint resolutions terminating\nthe President’s emergency declaration pursuant to its authority under 50\nU.S.C. § 1622(a)(1).

On February 25, the\nDepartment of Homeland Security (“DHS”) submitted to\nDoD a request for Section 284 assistance to block drug\nsmuggling corridors.  In particular, it requested that DoD\nfund “approximately 218 miles” of wall using this authority,\ncomprised of numerous projects.  On March 25, Acting\nSecretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan approved three border\nwall construction projects: Yuma Sector Projects 1 and 2 in\nArizona and El Paso Sector Project 1 in New Mexico.  On\nMay  9,  Shanahan  approved  four  more  border  wall\nconstruction projects: El Centro Sector Project 1 in California\nand Tucson Sector Projects 1–3 in Arizona.\nAt the time Shanahan authorized Section 284 support for\nthese border wall construction projects, the counter-narcotics\nsupport account contained only $238,306,000 in unobligated\nfunds, or less than one tenth of the $2.5 billion needed to\ncomplete those projects.  To provide the support requested,\nShanahan invoked the budgetary transfer authority found in\nSection 8005 of the 2019 DoD Appropriations Act to transfer\nfunds  from  other  DoD  appropriations  accounts  into  the\nSection 284 Drug Interdiction and Counter-Drug Activities-\nDefense appropriations account.\nFor  the  first  set  of  projects,  Shanahan  transferred\n$1 billion from Army personnel funds.  For the second set of\nprojects, Shanahan transferred $1.5 billion from “various\nexcess appropriations,” which contained funds originally\ndrug smuggling corridors across international boundaries of the United\nStates.” Id. § 284(b)(7).

DoD deviated from this practice\nhere—it  did  not  request  congressional  approval  before\nauthorizing the transfer.  Further, the House Committee on\nArmed Services and the House Committee on Appropriations\nboth  wrote  letters  to  DoD  formally  disapproving  of  the\nreprogramming action after the fact.  Moreover, with respect\nto the second transfer, Shanahan expressly directed that the\ntransfer of funds was to occur “without regard to comity-\nbased policies that require prior approval from congressional\ncommittees.”\nIn  the  end,  Section  8005  was  invoked  to  transfer\n$2.5 billion of DoD funds appropriated for other purposes to\nfund border wall construction.\nII\nOn  February  19,  2019,  Sierra  Club  filed  a  lawsuit\nchallenging the Executive Branch’s funding of the border\nwall.7  Sierra Club pled theories of violation of the 2019\n7 California, New Mexico, and fourteen other states had filed a\nlawsuit the previous day challenging the same border wall funding.

SBCC  alleged  that  since  the  Federal\nDefendants proposed border wall construction, it has had to\n“mobilize[] its staff and its affiliates to monitor and respond\nto the diversion of funds and the construction caused by and\naccompanying the national emergency declaration.”  These\n“activities have consumed the majority of SBCC staff’s time,\nthereby interfering with SBCC’s core advocacy regarding\nborder  militarization,  Border  Patrol  law-enforcement\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  2222  ooff  8822\n22 SIERRA CLUB V.

It makes no difference that\nthe border wall construction is the product of other statutory\nprovisions, such as Section 284, in addition to Section 8005. \n“Causation may be found even if there are multiple links in\nthe chain connecting the defendant’s unlawful conduct to the\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  2233  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V.

A judicial order\nprohibiting the Federal Defendants from spending the money\ntransferred pursuant to Section 8005 would stop construction,\nthereby preventing the harm alleged by Plaintiffs.  Thus,\nSierra Club and SBCC have established that their members\nsatisfy the demands of Article III standing to challenge the\nFederal Defendants’ actions.\nIV\nFirst,  we  consider  whether  Section  8005  or  any\nconstitutional provision authorized DoD to transfer the funds\nat issue.

See Sierra Club, 140 S.\nCt. at 1.  We heed the words of the Court, and carefully\nanalyze  Sierra  Club’s  arguments.    Having  done  so,  we\nconclude that Sierra Club has both a constitutional and an\nultra vires cause of action.\nIn reaching this result, we realize that this is a rare case in\nwhich the “judiciary may . . . have to intervene in determining\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  2266  ooff  8822\n26 SIERRA CLUB V.

We hold that it does.\nCertain  provisions  of  the  Constitution  give  rise  to\nequitable causes of action.  Such causes of action are most\nplainly  available  with  respect  to  provisions  conferring\nindividual rights, such as the Establishment Clause or the\nFree Exercise Clause.  See Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392,\n2416 (2018); Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83 (1968).  But certain\nstructural provisions give rise to causes of action as well.  See\nNat. Labor Relations. Bd. v.

The Court considered “whether a person indicted for\nviolating  a  federal  statute  has  standing  to  challenge  its\nvalidity  on  the  grounds  that,  by  enacting  it,  Congress\nexceeded its powers under the Constitution, thus intruding\nupon the sovereignty and authority of the States.”  564 U.S.\nat 214.  The Court held that “[j]ust as it is appropriate for an\nindividual, in a proper case, to invoke separation-of-powers\nor checks-and-balances constraints, so too may a litigant, in\na proper case, challenge a law as enacted in contravention of\nconstitutional principles of federalism.”  Id. at 223–24.  It\nreasoned  that  the  challenge  was  permissible  because\n“structural principles secured by the separation of powers\nprotect the individual as well,” and “[a]n individual has a\ndirect interest in objecting to laws that upset the constitutional\nbalance . . . when the enforcement of those laws causes injury\nthat is concrete, particular, and redressable.”  Id. at 222.  In\nother  words,  an  individual  who  otherwise  meets  the\nrequirements  of  Article  III  standing  may  challenge\ngovernment  action  that  violates  structural  constitutional\nprovisions intended to protect individual liberties.\nWe have held that the Appropriations Clause contains\nsuch a cause of action.  See McIntosh, 833 F.3d at 1173–74. \nIn McIntosh, defendants moved to enjoin their prosecutions\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  2288  ooff  8822\n28 SIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP\nfor  federal  marijuana  offenses  on  the  grounds  that  a\ncongressional appropriations rider prohibited the Department\nof Justice from spending federal funds on such prosecutions. \nId. at 1168.  We held that “[the Appropriations Clause]\nconstitutes a separation-of-powers limitation that Appellants\ncan invoke to challenge their prosecutions.”  Id. at 1175.  The\nopinion reasoned that so long as a litigant satisfies the Article\nIII  standing  requirements,  he  or  she  can  challenge\nAppropriations Clause violations because “[o]nce Congress,\nexercising its delegated powers, has decided the order of\npriorities in a given area, it is for . . . the courts to enforce\nthem when enforcement is sought.”  Id. at 1172 (quoting\nTenn. Valley Auth. v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153, 194 (1978)).  In\nMcIntosh, we also reaffirmed the Supreme Court’s statement\nin  Bond  that  “both  federalism  and  separation-of-powers\nconstraints in the Constitution serve to protect individual\nliberty, and a litigant in a proper case can invoke such\nconstraints ‘[w]hen government acts in excess of its lawful\npowers.’”  Id. at 1174 (quoting Bond, 564 U.S. at 222).12\nThe cause of action available to the plaintiffs in McIntosh\nis available to Sierra Club here.  Congress decided the order\nof priorities for border security.  In doing so, it chose to\nallocate $1.375 billion to fund the construction of pedestrian\n12  The  Federal  Defendants  incorrectly  characterize  McIntosh’s\nconstitutional holding as dicta.  The McIntosh Court discussed the\navailability of a constitutional cause of action, analogizing to Bond and\nCanning, and stating that “Appellants have standing to invoke separation-\nof-powers provisions of the Constitution to challenge their criminal\nconvictions.”  833 F.3d at 1174.  Because the Court “confront[ed] an issue\ngermane to the eventual resolution of the case,” and “resolve[d] it after\nreasoned consideration in a published opinion,” McIntosh’s constitutional\nholding is “the law of the circuit.”  Cetacean Cmty. v. Bush, 386 F.3d\n1169, 1173 (9th Cir. 2004) (quotations and citation omitted).\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  2299  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V.

It declined to\nprovide additional funding for projects in other areas, and it\ndeclined  to  provide  the  full  $5.7  billion  sought  by  the\nPresident: it is for the courts to enforce Congress’s priorities,\nand we do so here.  Where plaintiffs, like Sierra Club,\nestablish that they satisfy the requirements of Article III\nstanding, they may invoke separation-of-powers constraints,\nlike the Appropriations Clause, to challenge agency spending\nin excess of its delegated authority.\nThe Federal Defendants argue that Dalton v. Specter,\n511 U.S. 462 (1994) forecloses this result.  They assert that\nDalton’s proposition that not “every action by the President,\nor by another executive official, in excess of his statutory\nauthority is ipso facto in violation of the Constitution,” means\nthat when there is a claim that an Executive Branch official\nacted  in  excess  of  his  statutory  authority,  there  is  no\nconstitutional violation.  Id. at 472.  But Dalton does not hold\nthat every action in excess of statutory authority is not a\nconstitutional violation.13  Rather, Dalton suggests that some\n13 Notably, the plaintiffs in Dalton never alleged that the President\nviolated the Constitution and sought review “exclusively under the\n[Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”)].”  Id. at 471.  Only the Court of\nAppeals “sought to determine whether non-APA review, based on either\ncommon law or constitutional principles, was available.”  Id.  The\nSupreme Court did not consider whether the President had violated a\nspecific constitutional prohibition; instead, it took issue only with the\nCourt of Appeals’ contention that “whenever the President acts in excess\nof his statutory authority, he also violates the constitutional separation-of-\npowers doctrine.”  Id.  The Supreme Court’s objection to this conclusion\nis  unsurprising  in  the  context  of  the  Defense  Base  Closure  and\nRealignment Act of 1990 at issue in Dalton.  The Constitution divides\nauthority with respect to the military between Congress and the President. \nHere, in contrast, the Constitution delegates exclusively to Congress the\npower of the purse.\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  3300  ooff  8822\n30 SIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP\nactions in excess of statutory authority may be constitutional\nviolations,  while  others  may  not.    Specifically,  Dalton\nsuggests that a constitutional violation may occur when an\nofficer violates an express prohibition of the Constitution.  Id.\n(citing Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau\nof Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 396–97 (1971) for the distinction\nbetween “actions contrary to [a] constitutional prohibition,”\nand those “merely said to be in excess of the authority\ndelegated . . . by the Congress”).  The Appropriations Clause\ncontains such a constitutional prohibition, declaring that “[n]o\nMoney shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence\nof Appropriations made by Law . . . .”  U.S. Const. art.1, § 9,\ncl. 7.  Under Dalton, then, violations of the Appropriations\nClause may give rise to viable causes of action.\nDalton’s discussion of Youngstown only underscores this\npoint.  The Court determined that Youngstown could not stand\nfor the proposition “that an action taken by the President in\nexcess of his statutory authority necessarily violates the\nConstitution” because in Youngstown “no statutory authority\nwas claimed.”  Dalton, 511 U.S. at 473 (emphasis added). \nThe Court concluded only that “claims simply alleging that\nthe President has exceeded his statutory authority are not\n‘constitutional’ claims, subject to judicial review.”  Id.  Thus,\nDalton and its discussion of Youngstown do not address\nsituations in which the President exceeds his or her statutory\nauthority,  and  in  doing  so,  also  violates  a  specific\nconstitutional prohibition, as is the case here.\nNeither does Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Center, Inc.,\n575 U.S. 320 (2015), require an opposite result here.  In\nArmstrong, the Supreme Court rejected the argument that the\nSupremacy Clause created a private right of action.  Id.\nat  325–27.    But  the  Supremacy  Clause  is  not  the\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  3311  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V.

Cooke ed. 1961)), the\nAppropriations Clause contains an explicit prohibition, which\nprotects individual liberty, because “[a]ny exercise of a power\ngranted by the Constitution to one of the other branches of\nGovernment is limited by a valid reservation of congressional\ncontrol over funds in the Treasury,”  McIntosh, 833 F.3d at\n1175.  “The individual loses liberty in a real sense if [the\nappropriations  power]  is  not  subject  to  traditional\nconstitutional constraints.”  Clinton v. City of New York,\n524 U.S. at 451 (Kennedy, J., concurring).  Thus, while it\nmight be “strange” “to give a clause that makes federal law\nsupreme a reading that limits Congress’s power to enforce\nthat law,” Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 326, it is entirely sensible\nto  give  a  clause  that  restricts  the  power  of  the  federal\ngovernment as a whole a reading that safeguards individual\nliberty.\nTherefore,  because  the  Federal  Defendants  not  only\nexceeded  their  delegated  authority,  but  also  violated  an\nexpress  constitutional  prohibition  designed  to  protect\nindividual  liberties,  we  hold  that  Sierra  Club  has  a\nconstitutional cause of action here.\nB\nSecond, we consider whether Sierra Club has an equitable\nultra  vires  cause  of  action  to  challenge  the  Federal\nDefendants’ transfer.  We hold that it does.\nWhether Sierra Club can assert an equitable ultra vires\ncause of action turns on “whether the relief [it] request[s] . . .\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  3322  ooff  8822\n32 SIERRA CLUB V.

Equitable actions to enjoin ultra\nvires official conduct do not depend upon the availability of\na statutory cause of action; instead, they seek a “judge-made\nremedy”  for  injuries  stemming  from  unauthorized\ngovernment conduct, and they rest on the historic availability\nof equitable review.  Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 327.  “The\nsubstantive prerequisites for obtaining an equitable remedy\n. . . depend on traditional principles of equity jurisdiction.” \nGrupo Mexicano, 527 U.S. at 318–19 (quotations and citation\nomitted).\nThe relief Sierra Club requests has been traditionally\navailable.  “The ability to sue to enjoin unconstitutional\nactions by state and federal officers is the creation of courts\nof equity, and reflects a long history of judicial review of\nillegal  executive  action,  tracing  back  to  England.” \nArmstrong,  575  U.S.  at  327  (citing  Jaffe  &  Henderson,\nJudicial Review and the Rule of Law: Historical Origins,\n72 L.Q. Rev. 345 (1956)); see also Harmon v. Brucker,\n355 U.S. 579, 581–82 (1958) (“Generally, judicial relief is\navailable  to  one  who  has  been  injured  by  an  act  of  a\ngovernment official which is in excess of his express or\nimplied  powers.”).    Such  causes  of  action  have  been\ntraditionally available in American courts: “[w]hen Congress\nlimits its delegation of power, courts infer (unless the statute\nclearly  directs  otherwise)  that  Congress  expects  this\nlimitation to be judicially enforced.”  Dart v. United States,\n848 F.2d 217, 223 (D.C. Cir. 1988).\nThe passage of the APA has not altered this presumption. \n“Prior to the APA’s enactment . . . courts had recognized the\nright of judicial review of agency actions that exceeded\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  3333  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V.

There, Congress passed numerous statutes\nauthorizing the President to take personal and real property\nunder specific conditions.  343 U.S. at 585–86.  During the\nKorean War, however, President Truman signed an executive\norder seizing most of the nation’s steel mills, even though the\nconditions of the statutes had not been satisfied as a matter of\nfact.  Id. at 582, 586.  It fell to the Supreme Court to\ndetermine whether the President had constitutional authority\nto seize the steel mills—it held he did not and affirmed the\ndistrict court injunction.  Id. at 588–589.  The Court never\nquestioned that it had the authority to provide the requested\nrelief.\nSuch is the case here.  Section 8005 authorizes DoD to\ntransfer funds under certain conditions; however, as explained\npreviously, DoD failed to satisfy those conditions.  Likewise,\nas  explained  previously,  the  Executive  Branch  lacks\nindependent  constitutional  authority  to  fund  border  wall\nconstruction.  If an equitable ultra vires action was available\nto the plaintiffs in Youngstown, it surely must be available to\nSierra Club here.\nA number of D.C. Circuit cases reaffirm that review is\nordinarily available when an agency exceeds its delegation of\nauthority.  In Chamber of Commerce of the United States v.\nReich, the D.C.

Cir.  1996).    The\ngovernment argued that the Chamber of Commerce lacked a\nstatutory  cause of action and that APA review was not\navailable  because  the  challenge  was  directed  at  the\nPresident’s statutory authority to issue the executive order,\nand the President is not an agency within the meaning of the\nAPA.  See id.  The court agreed that APA review was not\navailable, but it held that non-statutory review remained\navailable.  See id. at 1327.  The court held that “[i]f a plaintiff\nis unable to bring his case predicated on either a specific or a\ngeneral statutory review provision, he may still be able to\ninstitute  a non-statutory review action.”  Id.  The court\nreasoned in part that “[t]he responsibility of determining the\nlimits of statutory grants of authority . . . is a judicial function\nentrusted  to  the  courts  by  Congress  by  the  statutes\nestablishing  courts  and  marking  their  jurisdiction.”    Id.\n(quoting Stark v. Wickard, 321 U.S. 288, 310 (1944)).\nLikewise, in Dart v. United States, the D.C. Circuit\nconsidered whether the plaintiff could challenge the Secretary\nof Commerce’s decision to impose civil sanctions for a\nviolation of the Export Administration Act (“EAA”).  See\n848 F.2d at 219.  The court held that even though the EAA\nexpressly limited judicial review, the court retained the ability\nto  review  whether  the  Secretary  exceeded  the  authority\ndelegated by the statute.  See id. at 223–34.  It explained that\n“the presumption of judicial review is particularly strong\nwhere  an  agency  is  alleged  to  have  acted  beyond  its\nauthority.”  Id. at 223.  It ultimately concluded that the\nSecretary had done just that and invalidated the sanctions he\nimposed.\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  3355  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP 35\nThese cases support our holding here that Sierra Club has\nan equitable ultra vires cause of action to challenge DoD’s\ntransfer of funds.  Where it is alleged that DoD has exceeded\nthe statutory authority delegated by Section 8005, plaintiffs\nlike Sierra Club can challenge this agency action.\nThe Federal Defendants contend that an equitable cause\nof  action  is  not  available  to  Sierra  Club  here  because\nequitable remedies are available only when they have been\n“traditionally  available  in  the  specific  circumstances\npresented,” and that the remedies sought here have not been\ntraditionally available in the specific circumstances presented\nby this case.\nThe Federal Defendants cite Grupo Mexicano in support\nof this argument, but that case provides little support for their\nposition.  In Grupo Mexicano, the Court considered whether\na  district  court  had  the  power  to  issue  a  preliminary\ninjunction to prevent the transfer of assets in which no lien or\nequitable interest was claimed.  See 527 U.S. at 318.  The\nCourt concluded it did not.  See id. at 333.  It held that a\ndistrict  court  cannot  grant  relief  that  “has  never  been\navailable before—and especially (as here) a type of relief that\nhas been specifically disclaimed by longstanding judicial\nprecedent,” particularly when “there is absolutely nothing\nnew about debtors’ trying to avoid paying their debts, or\nseeking to favor some creditors over others.”  Id. at 322; see\nid. at 333.\nHere, however, the plaintiffs request a type of relief that\nis consistent with our longstanding precedent.  Indeed, as\nexplained above, the Supreme Court has actually granted\ninjunctive relief in circumstances very similar to these.  See,\ne.g., Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 589.  Further, unlike attempts\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  3366  ooff  8822\n36 SIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP\nto avoid paying debts, instances of Executive Branch ultra\nvires action are, fortunately, relatively rare, and unlikely to\noccur in contexts likely to repeat themselves precisely.  Thus,\nthe  justifications  for  limiting  equitable  relief  in  Grupo\nMexicano are not present here, and courts are able to grant the\nrelief sought by Sierra Club.\nWe  therefore  hold  that  Sierra  Club  may  assert  an\nequitable ultra vires cause of action to challenge DoD’s\ntransfer of funds.\nC\nThe Federal Defendants raise a number of additional\narguments.  We address them here.\nFirst, the Federal Defendants assert that Sierra Club’s\nchallenge must be construed as an APA claim, rather than as\na constitutional or ultra vires cause of action.  But neither of\nthe two cases cited by the Federal Defendants compel this\nconclusion.  The Federal Defendants cite Hoefler v. Babbitt,\n139 F.3d 726, 728 (9th Cir. 1998) for the proposition that\n“[t]he APA is the sole means for challenging the legality of\nfederal agency action,” but there, we did not consider whether\nplaintiffs had a constitutional or ultra vires cause of action;\nrather,  we  considered  whether  the  action  was  properly\nconsidered under the APA or the Quiet Title Act.  See id.\nat  728–29.    We  ultimately  held  that  the  former  was\nappropriate.  See id. at 729.  To extrapolate from a general\nstatement made in this context, as the Federal Defendants do\nhere, goes too far.\nLikewise, in Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 175 (1997),\nthe  Court  did  not  consider  whether  plaintiffs  had  a\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  3377  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP 37\nconstitutional cause of action; rather, the Court considered\nwhether the citizen-suit provision of the Endangered Species\nAct (“ESA”) provided an exclusive statutory remedy, or\nwhether a cause of action was also available under the APA. \nThe Court ultimately determined that “[n]othing in the ESA’s\ncitizen-suit provision expressly precludes review under the\nAPA, nor do we detect anything in the statutory scheme\nsuggesting a purpose to do so.”  Id.  If anything, this case\nunderscores  that  the  APA  is  not  to  be  construed  as  an\nexclusive remedy.  Thus, the APA does not displace all\nconstitutional and equitable causes of action.\nSecond, the Federal Defendants assert that the zone of\ninterests test must apply to any challenge brought by Sierra\nClub, and that Section 8005 prescribes the relevant zone of\ninterests.  We reject this argument.\nThe zone of interests test limits which plaintiffs can\ninvoke statutorily created causes of action.  Although earlier\ncases,  such  as  Association  of  Data  Processing  Services\nOrganizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150 (1970), suggested\nthat the test applied to constitutional causes of action, the\nSupreme Court’s most recent zone of interests case, Lexmark\nInternational,  Inc.  v.  Static  Control  Components,  Inc.,\n572 U.S. 118 (2014), clarifies that the test applies only to\nstatutory causes of action and causes of action under the\nAPA.  See id. at 129 (“[T]he modern ‘zone of interests’\nformulation originated . . . as a limitation on the cause of\naction for judicial review conferred by the [APA],” but “[w]e\nhave  since  made  clear,  however,  that  it  applies  to  all\nstatutorily created causes of action.” (emphasis added)).\nCommon sense supports this approach.  As Judge Bork\nexplained in Haitian Refugee Center v. Gracey,\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  3388  ooff  8822\n38 SIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP\nAppellants need not, however, show that their\ninterests fall within the zones of interests of\nthe  constitutional  and  statutory  powers\ninvoked by the President in order to establish\ntheir standing to challenge the interdiction\nprogram  as  ultra  vires.  Otherwise,  a\nmeritorious  litigant,  injured  by  ultra  vires\naction, would seldom have standing to sue\nsince the litigant’s interest normally will not\nfall within the zone of interests of the very\nstatutory or constitutional provision that he\nclaims does not authorize action concerning\nthat interest. For example, were a case like\nYoungstown,  to  arise  today,  the  steel  mill\nowners would not be required to show that\ntheir interests fell within the zone of interests\nof the President’s war powers in order to\nestablish  their  standing  to  challenge  the\nseizure of their mills as beyond the scope of\nthose powers.\n809 F.2d 794, 811 n.14 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (emphasis added). \nWe agree with Judge Bork.14  It would make little sense to\n14 While the dissent asserts that we rely on the wrong portion of Judge\nBork’s opinion, we disagree.  Section 8005 cannot merely be read as a\nstatutory  provision  limiting  the  authority  conferred  when  it  is\nsimultaneously a statutory power invoked by the President.  In any case,\nas explained below, the relevant limitation here is not the inapplicable\nstatutory power invoked by the Executive—Section 8005—but instead the\nrestriction on unlawful action—the Appropriations Clause.  See also Ctr.\nfor Biodiversity v. Trump, No. 1:19-cv-00408, 2020 WL 1643657 at *25\n(D.D.C. Apr. 2, 2020) (quoting the same language from Haitian Refugee\nCenter and holding that plaintiffs “thus need not satisfy the zone of\ninterests test for their ultra vires claims.”).\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  3399  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP 39\nrequire Sierra Club to demonstrate that it falls within the zone\nof  interests  of  Section  8005.    Congress  may  not  have\ncontemplated the environmental advocacy group when it\nincluded  Section  8005  in  the  defense  budget,  but\nnevertheless, Sierra Club has asserted a legally cognizable\ninjury.  The fact Congress did not have Sierra Club as a\nparticular plaintiff in mind when it authorized Section 8005’s\ntransfer authority does not make its injury less real, nor\nDoD’s action more lawful.\nIf  the  zone  of  interests  test  applies  at  all,  the\nAppropriations Clause of the Constitution defines the zone of\ninterests because it is the “particular provision of law upon\nwhich  [Sierra  Club]  relies”  in  seeking  relief.    Bennett,\n520 U.S. at 175–76.  Section 8005 is relevant only because,\nto the extent it applies, it authorizes executive action that\notherwise would be unconstitutional or ultra vires.  That a\nstatute is relevant does not transform a constitutional claim\ninto a statutory one.  Sierra Club’s cause of action stems from\nthe  Federal  Defendants’  violation  of  the  Appropriations\nClause because it seeks to enforce the limits mandated by the\nclause.\nTo the extent the zone of interests test ever applies to\nconstitutional causes of action, it asks only whether a plaintiff\nis “arguably within the zone of interests to be protected . . . by\nthe . . . constitutional guarantee in question.”  Boston Stock\nExch. v. State Tax Comm’n, 429 U.S. 318, 320 n.3 (1977)\n(quoting Data Processing, 397 U.S. at 153).  This renders the\ntest nearly superfluous: so long as a litigant is asserting an\ninjury in fact to his or her constitutional rights, he has a cause\nof action.  See ERWIN CHEMERINKSY, FEDERAL JURISDICTION\n112 (7th ed. 2016) (citing LAURENCE TRIBE, AMERICAN\nCONSTITUTIONAL LAW 446 (3d ed. 2000)).\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  4400  ooff  8822\n40 SIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP\nApplying that generous formulation of the test here,\nSierra Club falls within the Appropriations Clause’s zone of\ninterests.  Here, Sierra Club is an organization within the\nUnited States that is protected by the Constitution.  The\nAppropriations Clause is a “bulwark of the Constitution’s\nseparation of powers,” U.S. Dep’t. of Navy v. Fed. Labor\nRelations Auth., 665 F.3d 1339, 1347 (D.C. Cir. 2012), and\nthe “separation of powers can serve to safeguard individual\nliberty,” McIntosh, 833 F.3d at 1174 (quoting Noel Canning,\n573 U.S. at 525).  The unconstitutional transfer of funds here\ninfringed  upon  Sierra  Club’s  members’  liberty  interests,\nharming  their  environmental,  aesthetic,  and  recreational\ninterests.  Thus, Sierra Club falls within the Clause’s zone of\ninterests, and Sierra Club has a cause of action to challenge\nthe transfers.\nVI\nFinally, we consider whether the district court abused its\ndiscretion in granting Sierra Club a permanent injunction\nenjoining the Federal Defendants from spending the funds at\nissue.  We hold it did not, and we affirm the district court\ninjunction.\nA  permanent  injunction  is  appropriate  when:  (1)  a\nplaintiff will suffer an irreparable injury absent injunction,\n(2) remedies available at law are inadequate,15 (3) the balance\nof  hardships  between  the  parties  supports  an  equitable\nremedy, and (4) the public interest would not be disserved. \neBay Inc. v. MercExchange, LLC, 547 U.S. 388, 391 (2006). \nWhen the government is a party to the case, the court should\nconsider the balance of hardships and public interests factors\n15 The parties do not contest this factor and so we do not address it.\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  4411  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP 41\ntogether.  See Drakes Bay Oyster Co. v. Jewell, 747 F.3d\n1073, 1092 (9th Cir. 2014).  Although injunctive relief “does\nnot follow from success on the merits as a matter of course,” \nWinter v. NRDC, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 32 (2008), we review a\ndistrict court’s decision to grant a permanent injunction for\nabuse of discretion, see eBay, 547 U.S. at 391.\nThe district court did not abuse its discretion in weighing\nthese  factors  and  determining  that  injunctive  relief  was\nwarranted.  First, we agree with the district court that Sierra\nClub would suffer irreparable harm to its recreational and\naesthetic interests absent injunction.  An organization can\ndemonstrate irreparable harm by showing that the challenged\naction will injure its members’ enjoyment of public lands. \nSee All. for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1135\n(9th Cir. 2011) (finding irreparable harm when the Forest\nService’s  proposed  project  would  harm  the  Alliance’s\nmembers’ ability to “view, experience, and utilize” national\nforest areas in an undisturbed state).  We conclude that Sierra\nClub sufficiently demonstrated that the Federal Defendants’\nproposed use of funds would harm its members ability to\nrecreate and enjoy public lands along the border such that it\nwill suffer irreparable harm absent injunction.\nThe Federal Defendants’ arguments to the contrary are\nunpersuasive.  The Federal Defendants submit that Sierra\nClub will not be irreparably harmed because its members\nhave plenty of other space to enjoy.  We have already rejected\nthe essence of the Federal Defendants’ argument.  See All. for\nthe Wild Rockies, 632 F.3d at 1135 (concluding that the\nForest  Service’s  argument  that  plaintiffs  can  “view,\nexperience, and utilize other areas of the forest” “proves too\nmuch,” because its logical extension is that a “plaintiff can\nnever suffer irreparable injury resulting from environmental\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  4422  ooff  8822\n42 SIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP\nharm in a forest as long as there are other areas of the forest\nthat are not harmed” (internal citations omitted)).\nMoreover, we agree with the district court that the balance\nof equities and the public interest favor injunctive relief here. \nThe public has an important interest in “ensuring that statutes\nenacted  by  their  representatives  are  not  imperiled  by\nexecutive  fiat.”    E.  Bay  Sanctuary  Covenant  v.  Trump,\n932 F.3d 742, 779 (9th Cir. 2018) (quotations and citation\nomitted).  By passing the CAA, Congress made a calculated\nchoice to fund only one segment of border barrier.  The\npublic interest favors enforcing this decision.  In contrast, the\nFederal Defendants cannot suffer harm “from an injunction\nthat  merely  ends  an  unlawful  practice.”    Rodriguez  v.\nRobbins, 715 F.3d 1127, 1145 (9th Cir. 2013) (citing Zepeda\nv. INS, 753 F.2d 719, 727 (9th Cir. 1983) (“[T]he INS cannot\nreasonably assert that it is harmed in any legally cognizable\nsense by being enjoined from constitutional violations.”)). \nWe agree with the district court that the Federal Defendants’\nposition essentially “boils down to an argument that the Court\nshould not enjoin conduct found to be unlawful because the\nends justify the means.”  No matter how great the collateral\nbenefits of building a border wall may be, the transfer of\nfunds for construction  remains unlawful.  The equitable\nmaxim “he who comes in equity must come with clean\nhands” would be turned on its head if unlawful conduct by\none party precluded a court from granting equitable relief to\nthe opposing party.  The district court properly concluded that\nthe balance of equities and the public interest favor injunctive\nrelief.\nThe Federal Defendants’ additional arguments do not\ncompel a different result.  First, the Supreme Court’s decision\nin Winter does not require us to vacate the injunction.  In\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  4433  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP 43\nWinter, the Supreme Court reversed a preliminary injunction\nenjoining the Navy from using a particular type of sonar that\nwas essential to its training exercises because it violated\nNEPA and a number of federal environmental laws.  555 U.S.\nat 16–17.  Key distinctions between this case and Winter\nrender it inapposite.  There, plaintiffs’ “ultimate legal claim\n[was] that the Navy must prepare an [environmental impact\nstatement], not that it must cease sonar training” because the\nuse of the sonar had otherwise been sanctioned by law.  Id.\nat 32.  Having determined that the “continuation of the\nexercises . . . was ‘essential to national security,’” id. at 18,\nthe President had used his statutory authority to “exempt from\ncompliance those elements of the Federal agency activity that\n[were] found by the Federal court to be inconsistent with an\napproved State program,” 16 U.S.C. § 1456(c)(1)(B).  In\naddition, the Council on Environmental Quality (“CEQ”) had\nauthorized the Navy to implement alternative arrangements\nto NEPA compliance that would allow the Navy to conduct\nits training exercises under mitigation procedures, but it\nimposed  additional  notice,  research,  and  reporting\nrequirements.  Winter, 555 U.S. at 18–19.\nBy contrast, here, Sierra Club’s ultimate legal claim is\nthat  DoD  cannot  legally  use  Section  8005  to  fund\nconstruction of the border wall, and moreover, that no such\nexemption applies.  If anything, Section 8005 itself is a\ndefense  against  the  Executive  Branch’s  unconstitutional\ntransfer of funds; however, as discussed previously, it offers\nno such legal cover here.  Therefore, while the use of the\nsonar was not unlawful at the time the Supreme Court vacated\nthe injunction in Winter, DoD’s transfer of funds here is. \nWhile the injunction here “merely ends an unlawful practice,”\nRodriguez,  715  F.3d  at  1145,  the  injunction  in  Winter\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  4444  ooff  8822\n44 SIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP\nenjoined  conduct  that  had  been  sanctioned  by  law,  see\nWinter, 555 U.S. at 32.\nMoreover, the public interest at issue in Winter more\nclearly favored vacating the injunction.  “Antisubmarine\nwarfare [was] [] the Pacific Fleet’s top war-fighting priority.” \nWinter, 555 U.S. at 12.  Accordingly, the use of MFA sonar\nduring training missions was deemed “mission-critical,” id.\nat 14, because it is not only the “most effective technology,”\nid.  at  13,  but  “the  only  proven  method  of  identifying\nsubmerged diesel-electric submarines operating on battery\npower,” id. at 14.  On the other side of the equation, “the\nmost serious possible injury [to plaintiffs] would be harm to\nan unknown number of marine mammals.”  Id. at 26.  The\nCourt reasonably concluded that the “balance of equities and\nconsideration of the overall public interest . . . tip strongly in\nfavor of the Navy.”  Id.\nThe balance of interests does not so starkly favor the\nFederal Defendants here.  Although they allege that the\ninjunction “frustrates the government’s ability to stop the\nflow of drugs across the border,” unlike the government in\nWinter, the Federal Defendants have failed to demonstrate\nthat construction of the border wall would serve this purpose,\nor alternatively, that an injunction would inhibit this purpose. \nThe Federal Defendants cite drug trafficking statistics, but\nfail to address how the construction of additional physical\nbarriers  would  further  the  interdiction  of  drugs.    The\nExecutive Branch’s failure to show, in concrete terms, that\nthe  public  interest  favors  a  border  wall  is  particularly\nsignificant given that Congress determined fencing to be a\nlower budgetary priority and the Department of Justice’s own\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  4455  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V.

In  each  case,  a  distinct  group  of\nplaintiffs brought suit challenging the Acting Secretary of\nDefense’s invocation of § 8005 and § 9002 of the Department\nof Defense Appropriations Act, 2019 (“DoD Appropriations\nAct”), Pub.

In California v.

The district\ncourt granted declaratory relief to both sets of plaintiffs\ninvalidating the transfers, but it granted permanent injunctive\nrelief only to the Organizations.  The majority concludes that\nthe Organizations have Article III standing; that they have a\ncause  of  action  to  challenge  the  transfers  under  the\nAppropriations Clause of the Constitution as well as a cause\nof action under an equitable  ultra vires theory; that the\ntransfers were unlawful; and that the district court properly\ndetermined that the Organizations are entitled to declaratory\nand injunctive relief.  I agree that at least the Sierra Club has\nestablished  Article  III  standing,  but  in  my  view  the\nOrganizations lack any cause of action to challenge the\ntransfers.

Before\nturning  to  the  merits,  I  will  briefly  review  both  that\nframework and that history.\nA\nUpon  request  from  another  federal  department,  the\nSecretary of Defense is authorized to “provide support for the\ncounterdrug activities” of that department by undertaking the\n“[c]onstruction  of  roads  and  fences  and  installation  of\nlighting  to  block  drug  smuggling  corridors  across\ninternational boundaries of the United States.”  10 U.S.C.\n§ 284(a), (b)(7).  On February 25, 2019, the Department of\nHomeland Security (“DHS”) made a formal request to DoD\nfor such assistance.  Noting that its counterdrug activities\nincluded the construction of border infrastructure, see Illegal\nImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of\n1996 (“IIRIRA”), Pub. L. No. 104-208, Div. C, § 102(a),\n110 Stat. 3009-546, 3009-554 (1996) (codified as amended as\na note to 8 U.S.C. § 1103), DHS requested that “DoD,\npursuant to its authority under 10 U.S.C. § 284(b)(7), assist\nwith the construction of fences[,] roads, and lighting” in\nseveral specified “Project Areas” in order “to block drug-\nsmuggling  corridors  across  the  international  boundary\nbetween the United States and Mexico.”\nOn  March  25,  2019,  the  Acting  Defense  Secretary\ninvoked § 284 and approved the provision of support for\nDHS’s “El Paso Sector Project 1” (which would involve DoD\nconstruction of border fencing, roads, and lighting in Luna\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  4499  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP 49\nand Doña Ana Counties in New Mexico), as well as for, inter\nalia, DHS’s “Yuma Sector Project 1” (which would involve\nDoD construction of similar border infrastructure in Yuma\nCounty, Arizona).  Thereafter, the Secretary of Homeland\nSecurity invoked his authority under § 102(c) of IIRIRA to\nwaive a variety of federal environmental statutes with respect\nto the planned construction of border infrastructure in the\nrelevant portions of the El Paso Sector and the Yuma Sector,\nas well as “all . . . state . . . laws, regulations, and legal\nrequirements of, deriving from, or related to the subject of,”\nthose federal laws.  See 84 Fed. Reg. 17185, 17187 (Apr. 24,\n2019); 84 Fed. Reg. 17187, 17188 (Apr. 24, 2019).\nSubsequently,  on  May  9,  2019,  the  Acting  Defense\nSecretary again invoked § 284, this time to approve DoD’s\nconstruction of similar border infrastructure to support DHS’s\n“El Centro Sector Project 1” in Imperial County, California,\nand DHS’s “Tucson Sector Projects 1, 2, and 3” in Pima and\nCochise Counties in Arizona.  Less than a week later, the\nSecretary of Homeland Security again invoked his authority\nunder  IIRIRA  §  102(c)  to  waive  federal  and  state\nenvironmental laws, this time with respect to the construction\nin the relevant sections of the El Centro Sector and the\nTucson Sector.  See 84 Fed. Reg. 21800, 21801 (May 15,\n2019); 84 Fed. Reg. 21798, 21799 (May 15, 2019).\nAlthough § 284 authorized the Acting Defense Secretary\nto provide this support, there were insufficient funds in the\nrelevant DoD appropriation to do so.  Specifically, for Fiscal\nYear 2019, Congress had appropriated for “Drug Interdiction\nand  Counter-Drug  Activities,  Defense”  a  total  of  only\n$670,271,000 that could be used for counter-drug support. \nSee DoD Appropriations Act, Title VI, 132 Stat. at 2997\n(appropriating, under Title governing “Other Department of\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  5500  ooff  8822\n50 SIERRA CLUB V.

That  transfer  was\naccomplished by moving $993,627,000 from the “Military\nPersonnel, Army” appropriation and $6,373,000 from the\n“Reserve Personnel, Army” appropriation.\nTo support the El Centro Sector Project 1 and Tucson\nSector Projects 1, 2, and 3, the Acting Secretary on May 9,\n2019  again  invoked  his  transfer  authority  to  move  an\nadditional  $1.5  billion  into  the  “Drug  Interdiction  and\nCounter-Drug Activities, Defense” appropriation.  Pursuant\nto § 8005 of the DoD Appropriations Act, DoD transferred a\ntotal of $818,465,000 from 12 different DoD appropriations\ninto the “Drug Interdiction and Counter-Drug Activities,\nDefense” appropriation.  Invoking the Secretary’s distinct but\ncomparable  authority  under  §  9002  to  transfer  funds\nappropriated under the separate Title governing “Overseas\nContingency  Operations,”  DoD transferred  $604,000,000\nfrom the “Afghanistan Security Forces Fund” appropriation\nand  $77,535,000  from  the  “Operation  and  Maintenance,\nDefense-Wide” appropriation into the “Drug Interdiction and\nCounter-Drug Activities, Defense” appropriation.\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  5511  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP 51\nB\nThe complex procedural context of this case involves two\nparallel lawsuits and four appeals to this court, and it has\nalready produced one published Ninth Circuit opinion that\nwas promptly displaced by the Supreme Court.\n1\nThe Organizations filed this action in the district court\nagainst the Acting Defense Secretary, DoD, and a variety of\nother federal officers and agencies.  In their March 18, 2019\nFirst Amended Complaint, they sought to challenge, inter\nalia, any transfer of funds by the Acting Secretary under\n§ 8005 or § 9002.  California and New Mexico, joined by\nseveral other States, filed a similar action, and their March\n13, 2019 First Amended Complaint also sought to challenge\nany  such  transfers.    Both  sets  of  plaintiffs  moved  for\npreliminary injunctions in early April 2019.  The portion of\nthe States’ motion that was directed at the § 8005 transfers\nwas asserted only on behalf of New Mexico and only with\nrespect to the construction on New Mexico’s border (i.e., El\nPaso Sector Project 1).  The Organizations’ motion was\nlikewise directed at El Paso Sector Project 1, but it also\nchallenged Yuma Sector Projects 1 and one other project\n(“Yuma Sector Project 2”).\nAfter concluding that the Organizations were likely to\nprevail on their claims that the transfers under § 8005 were\nunlawful  and  that  these  organizational  plaintiffs  had\ndemonstrated  a  “likelihood  of  irreparable  harm  to  their\nmembers’ aesthetic and recreational interests,” the district\ncourt on May 24, 2019 granted a preliminary injunction\nenjoining Defendants from using transferred funds for “Yuma\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  5522  ooff  8822\n52 SIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP\nSector  Project  1  and  El  Paso  Sector  Project  1.”2    In  a\ncompanion  order,  however,  the  district  court  denied\npreliminary injunctive relief to the States.  Although the court\nheld that New Mexico was likely to succeed on its claim that\nthe transfers under § 8005 were unlawful, the court concluded\nthat, in light of the grant of a preliminary injunction against\nEl Paso Sector Project 1 to the Organizations, New Mexico\nwould not suffer irreparable harm from the denial of its\nduplicative  request  for  such  relief.    On  May  29,  2019,\nDefendants appealed the preliminary injunction in favor of\nthe Organizations, and after the district court refused to stay\nthat  injunction,  Defendants  moved  in  this  court  for  an\nemergency stay on June 3, 2019.  New Mexico did not appeal\nthe district court’s denial of its duplicative request for a\npreliminary injunction.\n2\nWhile the Defendants’ emergency stay request was being\nbriefed and considered in this court, the Organizations moved\nfor partial summary judgment on June 12, 2019.  The motion\nwas limited to the issue of whether the transfers under § 8005\nand § 9002 were lawful, and it requested corresponding\ndeclaratory relief, as well as a permanent injunction against\nthe use of transferred funds for all six projects (El Paso Sector\nProject 1, El Centro Sector Project 1, Yuma Sector Project 1,\nand Tucson Sector Projects 1, 2, and 3).  California and New\nMexico (but not the other States) filed a comparable summary\njudgment motion that same day, directed only at El Paso\n2 By the time the district court ruled, DoD had decided not to use\nfunds transferred under § 8005 for any construction in Yuma Sector\nProject 2, and so the request for a preliminary injunction as to that project\nwas moot.\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  5533  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP 53\nSector Project 1 and El Centro Sector Project 1.  Defendants\nfiled cross-motions for summary judgment on the legality of\nthe transfers under § 8005 and § 9002 with respect to the\ncorresponding projects at issue in each case.\nOn  June  28,  2019,  the  district  court  granted  partial\nsummary judgment and declaratory relief to both sets of\nplaintiffs, concluding that the transfers under § 8005 and\n§  9002  were  unlawful.    The  court  granted  permanent\ninjunctive relief to the Organizations against all six projects,\nbut it denied any such relief to California and New Mexico. \nThe district court concluded that California and New Mexico\nhad  failed  to  prove  a  threat  of  future  demonstrable\nenvironmental harm.  The court expressed doubts about the\nStates’ alternative theory that they had demonstrated injury to\ntheir sovereign interests, but the court ultimately concluded\nthat it did not need to resolve that issue.  As before, the\ndistrict court instead held that California and New Mexico\nwould  not  suffer  any  irreparable  harm  in  light  of  the\nduplicative relief granted to the Organizations.  The district\ncourt  denied  Defendants’  cross-motions  for  summary\njudgment in both cases.  Invoking its authority under Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 54(b), the district court entered\npartial judgments in favor of, respectively, the Sierra Club\nand SBCC, and California and New Mexico.  The district\ncourt  denied  Defendants’  request  to  stay  the  permanent\ninjunction pending appeal.\n3\nOn June 29, 2019, Defendants timely appealed in both\ncases and asked this court to stay the permanent injunction\nbased on the same briefing and argument that had been\npresented in the preliminary injunction appeal.

TRUMP\nand New Mexico timely cross-appealed nine days later.  On\nJuly 3, 2019, this court consolidated Defendants’ appeal of\nthe judgment and permanent injunction with Defendants’\npending appeal of the preliminary injunction.3  That same\nday, a motions panel of this court issued a 2–1 published\ndecision  denying  Defendants’  motion  for  a  stay  of  the\npermanent injunction (which had overtaken the preliminary\ninjunction).  See Sierra Club v. Trump, 929 F.3d 670 (9th Cir.\n2019).\nDefendants then applied to the Supreme Court for a stay\nof the permanent injunction pending appeal, which the Court\ngranted on July 26, 2019.  See Trump v. Sierra Club, 140 S.\nCt. 1 (2019).  That stay remains in effect “pending disposition\nof the Government’s appeal in the United States Court of\nAppeals  for  the  Ninth  Circuit  and  disposition  of  the\nGovernment’s petition for a writ of certiorari, if such writ is\ntimely sought.”  Id. at 1.  In granting the stay, the Court\nconcluded  that  “the  Government  has  made  a  sufficient\nshowing at this stage that [the Sierra Club and SBCC] have\nno cause of action to obtain review of the Acting Secretary’s\ncompliance with Section 8005.”  Id.\nII\nDefendants have not contested the Article III standing of\nthe Sierra Club and SBCC on appeal, but as the majority\nnotes, “‘the court has an independent obligation to assure that\nstanding exists, regardless of whether it is challenged by any\nof the parties.’”  See Maj. Opin. at 17 n.9 (quoting  Summers\nv. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 499 (2009)). As “an\n3 This court later consolidated the appeal and cross-appeal in the\nStates’ case with the already-consolidated appeals in this case.\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  5555  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V.

Defenders\nof Wildlife (Lujan v. Defenders), 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992). \nThus, although well-pleaded allegations are enough at the\nmotion-to-dismiss stage, they are insufficient to establish\nstanding at the summary-judgment stage.  Id.  “In response to\na summary judgment motion, . . . the plaintiff can no longer\nrest on such mere allegations, but must set forth by affidavit\nor other evidence specific facts, which for purposes of the\nsummary judgment motion will be taken to be true.”  Id.\n(simplified).\nIn reviewing standing sua sponte in the context of cross-\nmotions for summary judgment, it is appropriate to apply the\nmore lenient standard that takes the plaintiffs’ evidence as\ntrue and then asks whether a reasonable trier of fact could\nfind Article III standing.  Lujan v. Defenders, 504 U.S. at 563\n(applying this standard in evaluating whether Government’s\ncross-motion  for  summary  judgment  should  have  been\ngranted).  In their briefs below concerning the parties’ cross-\nmotions,  the  Sierra  Club  and  SBCC  each  asserted  that\nDefendants’ allegedly unlawful conduct caused harm to their\nmembers’ recreational, aesthetic, and environmental interests. \nAccepting the Organizations’ evidence as true, and drawing\nall reasonable inferences in their favor, a reasonable trier of\nfact  could  conclude  that  at  least  the  Sierra  Club  has\nassociational standing under Hunt v. Washington State Apple\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  5566  ooff  8822\n56 SIERRA CLUB V.

Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333 (1977).4  Under the Hunt test,\nan  association  has  standing  if  “(a)  its  members  would\notherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the\ninterests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization’s\npurpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted nor the relief\nrequested requires the participation of individual members in\nthe lawsuit.”  Id. at 343.  The Sierra Club has presented\nsufficient evidence as to each of these three requirements.\nTo establish that its members would suffer irreparable\nharm  absent  a  permanent  injunction,  the  Sierra  Club\npresented declarations from members who regularly visit the\nrespective project areas.  These members described how the\nconstruction and the resulting border barriers would interfere\nwith their enjoyment of the surrounding landscape and would\nimpede their ability to fish, to hunt, to monitor and document\nwildlife and vegetation for educational purposes, and to\nparticipate in other activities near the project sites.  These\ninjuries  to  the  members’  recreational,  aesthetic,  and\nenvironmental interests are sufficient to constitute an injury-\nin-fact for Article III purposes.  See Lujan v. Defenders,\n504 U.S. at 562–63 (“Of course, the desire to use or observe\nan  animal  species,  even  for  purely  esthetic  purposes,  is\nundeniably a cognizable interest for purpose of standing.”). \nMoreover,  these  injuries  are  fairly  traceable  to  the\nconstruction, and an injunction blocking the transfers would\nredress  those  injuries  by  effectively  stopping  that\n4 The district court explicitly addressed Article III standing only in\nconnection with the preliminary injunction motion.  Although Article III\nstanding was not revisited when the Organizations subsequently moved\nfor summary judgment and a permanent injunction, the Organizations’\nshowing of injury in support of a permanent injunction provides a\nsufficient basis for evaluating their Article III standing.\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  5577  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP 57\nconstruction.  See id. at 560–61.  This evidence is therefore\nsufficient to establish that these members would have Article\nIII standing to sue in their own right.\nThe other Hunt requirements are also satisfied.  These\nmembers’ interests are clearly germane to the Sierra Club’s\nmission to protect the natural environment and local wildlife\nand plant life.  And in seeking declaratory and injunctive\nrelief,  the  lawsuit  does  not  require  the  participation  of\nindividual members.  See Hunt, 432 U.S. at 343.\nBecause the Sierra Club satisfies the applicable standing\nrequirements as to all of the challenged projects, we may\nproceed to the merits without having to address SBCC’s\nstanding.  See Secretary of the Interior v. California, 464 U.S.\n312, 319 n.3 (1984) (“Since the State of California clearly\ndoes have standing, we need not address the standing of the\nother [plaintiffs], whose position here is identical to the\nState’s.”).  And given my view that the Organizations’ legal\nchallenges fail, I perceive no obstacle to entering judgment\nagainst both the Sierra Club and SBCC without determining\nwhether the latter has standing.  See Steel Co. v. Citizens for\na Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 98 (1998).\nIII\nAfter  examining  the  Article  III  standing  of  the\nOrganizations, the majority then proceeds straight to the\nmerits of whether the transfers were unlawful.  See Maj.\nOpin. at 23.  But we ought not address that issue unless we\nhave first determined that the Organizations have asserted a\nviable cause of action that properly brings that issue before\nus.  See Air Courier Conf. v. American Postal Workers Union\nAFL-CIO, 498 U.S. 517, 530–31 (1991).

TRUMP\nbelatedly gets to that question in Section V of its opinion,\nholding that the Organizations have two viable causes of\naction: an equitable cause of action under the Constitution\nand an ultra vires cause of action.  See Maj. Opin. at 25.  I\ndisagree with that conclusion, and I also disagree with the\nOrganizations’ alternative argument that they have a valid\ncause of action under the Administrative Procedure Act\n(“APA”).  See Trump v. Sierra Club, 140 S. Ct. at 1 (“[T]he\nGovernment has made a sufficient showing at this stage that\nthe plaintiffs have no cause of action to obtain review of the\nActing Secretary’s compliance with Section 8005.”).5\n5 In its merits analysis, the majority scarcely cites the motions panel’s\npublished decision, which addressed the Organizations’ likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits of many of the same issues before us.  I agree with\nthe majority’s implicit rejection of the Organizations’ contention that the\nmotions panel’s opinion bars this merits panel from examining these\nissues afresh.  Although the motions panel decision is a precedent, it\nremains subject to reconsideration by this court until we issue our\nmandate.  See United States v. Houser, 804 F.2d 565, 567–68 (9th Cir.\n1986) (distinguishing, on this point, between reconsideration of a prior\npanel’s decision “during the course of a single appeal” and a decision “on\na prior appeal”); cf. Gonzalez v. Arizona, 677 F.3d 383, 389 n.4 (9th Cir.\n2012) (en banc) (three-judge panel lacks authority to overrule a decision\nin a prior appeal in the same case).  To the extent that Lair v. Bullock, 798\nF.3d 736, 747 (9th Cir. 2015), suggests otherwise, that suggestion is dicta\nand directly contrary to our decision in Houser.  See East Bay Sanctuary\nCovenant v. Trump, 950 F.3d 1242, 1261–65 (9th Cir. 2020).  In all\nevents, the precedential force of the motions panel’s opinion was largely,\nif not entirely, vitiated by the Supreme Court’s subsequent decision to\ngrant the very stay that the motions panel’s opinion denied.  I do not\nagree, however, with the majority’s disregard of the Supreme Court’s\norder in this case—a disregard that hardly befits the “wary and humble”\nattitude the majority professes.  See Maj.

TRUMP 59\nA\nAlthough the Organizations invoke the APA only as a\nfallback to their preferred non-statutory claims, I think it is\nappropriate to first consider whether they have a statutory\ncause of action under the APA.  Cf. Chamber of Commerce\nv. Reich, 74 F.3d 1322, 1326–27 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (suggesting\nthat, if a plaintiff relies on both the APA and non-statutory-\nreview claims, the APA claim should be considered first). \nEven assuming arguendo that the APA does not displace\nreliance upon alternative non-statutory causes of action, see\ninfra at 69, the contours of any express cause of action under\nthe  APA  certainly  provide  appropriate  context  for  the\nconsideration of any non-statutory claim.\nIn authorizing suit by any person “adversely affected or\naggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant\nstatute,” 5 U.S.C. § 702, the APA incorporates the familiar\nzone-of-interests test, which reflects a background principle\nof law that always “applies unless it is expressly negated,”\nBennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 163 (1997); see also Lexmark\nInt’l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118,\n129 (2014).6  That test requires a plaintiff to “establish that\nthe injury he complains of (his aggrievement, or the adverse\neffect upon him) falls within the ‘zone of interests’ sought to\nbe protected by the statutory provision whose violation forms\nthe legal basis for his complaint.”  Lujan v. NWF, 497 U.S. at\n6 The Supreme Court has not squarely addressed whether the zone-of-\ninterests test applies to a plaintiff who claims to have “suffer[ed] legal\nwrong because of agency action,” which is the other class of persons\nauthorized to sue under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 702.  See Lujan v. National\nWildlife Fed. (Lujan v. NWF), 497 U.S. 871, 882–83 (1990).

Because the APA was\nintended to confer “generous review” of agency action, the\nzone-of-interests test is more flexibly applied under that\nstatute than elsewhere, and it requires only a showing that the\nplaintiff is “arguably within the zone of interests to be\nprotected  or  regulated  by  the  statute  or  constitutional\nguarantee in question.”  Association of Data Processing Serv.\nOrgs., Inc. v.

That question is easy here. \nThe Organizations’ complaint alleges that the challenged\ntransfers are not authorized by § 8005 and § 9002 because\n“[t]he diversion of funding to build a border wall or fence is\nnot based on unforeseen military requirements”; “the building\nof a permanent border wall is not a ‘military requirement’”;\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  6611  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V.

Lujan v. NWF,\n497 U.S. at 886.\nAlthough the Organizations invoke the Appropriations\nClause  and  the  constitutional  separation  of  powers  in\ncontending that Defendants’ actions are unlawful, any such\nconstitutional violations here can be said to have occurred\nonly if the transfers violated the limitations  set forth in\n§  8005:  if  Congress  authorized  DoD  to  transfer  the\nappropriated funds from one account to another, and to spend\nthem  accordingly,  then  the  money  has  been  spent  “in\nConsequence of Appropriations made by Law,” U.S. CONST.\nart.

NWF, 497 U.S.\nat 886.  To maintain a claim under the APA, therefore, the\nOrganizations must establish that they are within the zone of\ninterests of § 8005.9\n8 The only possible exception is the Organizations’ argument that\n§ 8005 itself violates the Presentment Clause.  As explained below, that\ncontention is frivolous.  See infra at 71–72.\n9 The Organizations briefly contend that DoD has exceeded its\nauthority under § 284 and has violated the National Environmental Policy\nAct (“NEPA”), but even assuming arguendo that the Organizations have\na cause of action to raise any such challenges, they are patently without\nmerit.  The Organizations note that § 284 contains a special reporting\nrequirement for “small scale construction” projects, which are defined as\nprojects costing $750,000 or less, 10 U.S.C. § 284(h)(1)(B), (i)(3), and\nthey argue that this shows that Congress did not authorize projects on the\nscale at issue here.  The inference is a non sequitur: the fact that Congress\nrequires special reporting of these smaller projects does not mean that they\nare the only projects authorized.  Congress may have imposed such a\nunique reporting requirement in order to capture the sort of smaller-scale\nactivities that might otherwise have escaped its notice.  And the fact that\npast expenditures under § 284 have happened to be for more modest\nprojects is irrelevant, because nothing in the text of § 284 imposes any\nsuch  size  limits  on  the  projects  authorized  by  that  statute.    The\nOrganizations’ reliance on NEPA is likewise meritless.  We have upheld\nDHS’s waiver of NEPA under § 102(c) of IIRIRA, see In re Border\nInfrastructure Envtl. Litig., 915 F.3d 1213, 1225 (9th Cir. 2019), and the\ndistrict court correctly concluded that the waiver applies to construction\nthat DoD undertakes under § 284 to “provide support” to DHS at DHS’s\n“request[],” 10 U.S.C. § 284.

First Nat’l Bank &\nTrust Co. (NCUA), 522 U.S. 479, 492 (1998) (simplified). \nIdentifying the interests protected by § 8005 is not difficult,\nand here the Organizations’ asserted interests are not among\nthem.\nSection 8005 is a grant of general transfer authority that\nallows the Secretary of Defense, if he determines “that such\naction is necessary in the national interest” and if the Office\nof Management and Budget approves, to transfer from one\nDoD “appropriation” into another up to $4 billion of the\nfunds  that  have  been  appropriated  under  the  DoD\nAppropriations Act “for military functions (except military\nconstruction).”  See 132 Stat. at 2999.  Section 8005 contains\nfive provisos that further regulate this transfer authority, and\nthe only limitations on the Secretary’s authority that the\nOrganizations claim were violated here are all contained in\nthe first such proviso.  That proviso states that “such authority\nto transfer may not be used unless for higher priority items,\nbased on unforeseen military requirements, than those for\nwhich originally appropriated and in no case where the item\nfor  which  funds  are  requested  has  been  denied  by  the\nCongress.”  Id.10  The remaining provisos require prompt\nnotice to Congress “of all transfers made pursuant to this\n10 Similar language has been codified into permanent law.

Id.\nFocusing on “the particular provision of law upon which\nthe plaintiff relies,” Bennett, 520 U.S. at 175–76, makes clear\nthat § 8005 as a whole, and its first proviso in particular,\nare  aimed  at  tightening  congressional  control  over  the\nappropriations  process.    The  first  proviso’s  general\nprohibition on transferring funds for any item that “has been\ndenied by the Congress” is, on its face, a prohibition on using\nthe  transfer  authority  to  effectively  reverse  Congress’s\nspecific  decision  to  deny  funds  to  DoD  for  that  item. \n132 Stat. at 2999.  The second major limitation imposed by\nthe first proviso states that the transfer authority is not to be\nused unless, considering the items “for which [the funds\nwere] originally appropriated,” there are “higher priority\nitems” for which the funds should now be used in light of\n“military requirements” that were “unforeseen” in DoD’s\nrequest for Fiscal Year 2019 appropriations.  Id.  The obvious\nfocus of this restriction is likewise to protect congressional\njudgments about appropriations by (1) restricting DoD’s\nability to reprioritize the use of funds differently from how\nCongress decided to do so and (2) precluding DoD from\ntransferring funds appropriated by Congress for “military\nfunctions”  for  purposes  that  do  not  reflect  “military\nrequirements.”    The  remaining  provisos,  including  the\ncongressional reporting requirement, all similarly aim to\nmaintain congressional control over appropriations.  And all\nof the operative restrictions in § 8005 that the Organizations\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  6655  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP 65\ninvoke here are focused solely on limiting DoD’s ability to\nuse  the  transfer  authority  to  reverse  the  congressional\njudgments reflected in DoD’s appropriations.\nIn  addition  to  preserving  congressional  control  over\nDoD’s appropriations, § 8005 also aims to give DoD some\nmeasure of flexibility to make necessary changes.  Notably,\nin  authorizing  the  Secretary  to  make  transfers  among\nappropriations, § 8005’s first proviso specifies only one\ncriterion that he must consider in exercising that discretion:\nhe must determine whether the item for which the funds will\nbe used is a “higher priority item[]” in light of “unforeseen\nmilitary requirements.”  132 Stat. at 2999 (emphasis added). \nUnder the statute, he need not consider any other factor\nconcerning either the original use for which the funds were\nappropriated or the new use to which they will now be put.\nIn light of these features of § 8005, the “interests” that the\nOrganizations claim are “affected by the agency action in\nquestion” are not “among” the “interests arguably to be\nprotected” by § 8005.  NCUA, 522 U.S. at 492 (simplified). \nIn  particular,  the  Organizations’  asserted  recreational,\naesthetic, and environmental interests clearly lie outside the\nzone of interests protected by § 8005.  The statute does not\nmention recreational, aesthetic, and environmental interests,\nnor does it require the Secretary to consider such interests. \nOn the contrary, the statute requires him only to consider\nwhether an item is a “higher priority” in light of “military\nrequirements,” and it is otherwise entirely neutral as to the\nuses to which the funds will be put.  Indeed, that neutrality is\nreflected on the face of the statute, which says that, once the\ntransfer is made, the funds are “merged with and . . . available\nfor the same purposes, and for the same time period, as the\nappropriation  or  fund  to  which  transferred.”    132  Stat.\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  6666  ooff  8822\n66 SIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP\nat 2999 (emphasis added).  Because the alleged recreational,\naesthetic, and environmental harms that the Organizations\nassert here play no role in the analysis that § 8005 requires\nthe Secretary to conduct, and are not among the harms that\n§  8005’s  limitations  seek  to  address  or  protect,  the\nOrganizations’ interests in avoiding these harms are not\nwithin § 8005’s zone of interests.\nMoreover, focusing on the specific interests for which the\nOrganizations have presented sufficient evidentiary support\nat the summary-judgment stage, see Lujan v. NWF, 497 U.S.\nat 884–85, further confirms that, in deciding whether to\nredirect excess military personnel funds under § 8005 to\nassist DHS by building fencing to stop international drug\nsmuggling, the Acting Secretary of Defense did not have to\ngive  even  the  slightest  consideration  to  whether  that\nreprogramming of funds would disrupt views of the desert\nlandscape or affect local flora and fauna.  Put simply, the\nOrganizations’  recreational,  aesthetic,  and  environmental\ninterests are “‘so marginally related to . . . the purposes\nimplicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed\nthat  Congress  intended  to  permit  the  suit.’”    Patchak,\n567 U.S. at 225 (quoting Clarke, 479 U.S. at 399).\n3\nThe Organizations nonetheless claim that they fall within\n§ 8005’s zone of interests because § 8005 was “aimed at\ntightening congressional control over executive spending,”\nand the Organizations’ interests do not “meaningfully diverge\nfrom Congress’s interests in enacting the statute.”  This\ncontention fails.  As the Supreme Court made clear in Lujan\nv. NWF, the zone-of-interests test requires the plaintiff to\nmake a factual showing that the plaintiff itself, or someone\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  6677  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V.

I am aware of no precedent that would support the\nview that these Organizations can represent the interests of\nCongress (akin to NWF’s representation of the interests of its\nmembers), much less that they can do so merely because they\nare sympathetic to Congress’s perceived policy objectives.11 \nBut the Organizations do not actually rely on such a novel\ntheory.    Instead,  the  Organizations  suggest  that,  merely\nbecause their overall litigation objectives here do not diverge\nfrom those of Congress, they have thereby satisfied the zone-\nof-interests test with respect to their own interests.  This\ntheory is clearly wrong.\nThe critical flaw in the Organizations’ analysis is that it\nrests, not on the interests they are asserting (preservation of\nlandscape, flora, fauna, etc.), but on the legal theory that the\nOrganizations invoke to protect those interests here.  But the\nzone-of-interests test focuses on the former and not the latter. \nSee Lujan v. NWF, 497 U.S. at 885–89.

By definition, anyone who alleges\na violation of a particular statute has thereby invoked a legal\ntheory  that  does  not  “meaningfully  diverge”  from  the\ninterests of those other persons or entities who are within that\nstatute’s zone-of-interests.  Such a tautological congruence\nbetween  the  Organizations’  legal  theory  and  Congress’s\ninstitutional interests is not sufficient to satisfy the zone-of-\ninterests test here.\nThe  Organizations  suggest  that  their  approach  is\nsupported  by  the  D.C.  Circuit’s  decision  in  Scheduled\nAirlines  Traffic  Offices,  Inc.  v.  Department  of  Defense,\n87 F.3d 1356 (D.C. Cir. 1996), but that is wrong.  As the\nopinion in that case makes clear, the D.C. Circuit was relying\non the same traditional zone-of-interests test, under which a\nplaintiff’s  interests  are  “outside  the  statute’s  ‘zone  of\ninterests’ only ‘if the plaintiff’s interests are so marginally\nrelated to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the\nstatute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress\nintended to permit the suit.’”  87 F.3d at 1360 (quoting\nClarke, 479 U.S. at 399).  The court mentioned “congruence”\nin the course of explaining why the plaintiff’s interests in that\ncase  were  “not  more  likely  to  frustrate  than  to  further\nstatutory  objectives,”  i.e.,  why  those  interests  were  not\ninconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute.  Id.\n(simplified).  It did not thereby suggest—and could not\nproperly have suggested—that the mere lack of any such\ninconsistency is alone sufficient under the zone-of-interests\ntest.  Here, the problem is not that the Organizations’ interests\nare inconsistent with the purposes of § 8005, but rather that\nthey are too “marginally related” to those purposes.

Sierra Club v. Trump, 929 F.3d at 715 (N.R.\nSmith, J., dissenting) (suggesting that “those who would have\nbeen entitled to the funds as originally appropriated” may be\nwithin the zone of interests of § 8005), but in any event, we\nare not entitled to bend the otherwise applicable—and already\nlenient—standards to ensure that someone will be able to sue\nin this case or others like it.\nB\nAs noted earlier, the Organizations only invoke the APA\nas a fallback option, and they instead insist that they may\nassert claims under the Constitution, as well as an equitable\ncause  of  action  to  enjoin  “ultra  vires”  conduct.    The\nOrganizations do not have a cause of action under either of\nthese theories.\n1\nThe Organizations contend that they are not required to\nsatisfy any zone-of-interests test to the extent that they assert\nnon-APA causes of action to enjoin Executive officials from\ntaking unconstitutional action.12  Even assuming that an\n12 It is not entirely clear that the Organizations are alternatively\ncontending that APA claims to enjoin unconstitutional conduct, see 5\nU.S.C. § 706(2)(B), are exempt from the zone-of-interests test.

The Organizations have failed\nto allege the sort of constitutional claim that might give rise\nto such an equitable action, because their “constitutional”\nclaim is effectively the very same § 8005-based claim dressed\nup in constitutional garb.  And even if this claim counted as\na “constitutional” one, it would still be governed by the same\nzone of interests defined by the relevant limitations in § 8005.\na\nThe Organizations assert three constitutional claims in\ntheir operative complaint: (1) that Defendants have violated\nthe  constitutional  separation  of  powers  by  “usurp[ing]\nCongress’s legislative authority”; (2) that Defendants have\nviolated  the  Presentment  Clause  by  “modify[ing]  or\nrepeal[ing] Congress’s appropriations legislation by executive\nproclamation, rather than by law”; and (3) that Defendants\nhave violated the Appropriations Clause by “allocat[ing]\nmoney from the Department of the Treasury by executive\nproclamation, rather than by law, and in contravention of\nrestrictions contained in Congress’s appropriations’ laws.” \nProcessing, 397 U.S. at 153 (zone-of-interests test requires APA claimant\nto show that its interest “is arguably within the zone of interests to be\nprotected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in\nquestion”).

In its\nstrong form, the Organizations’ argument is that, even if\n§  8005  authorized  the  transfers  in  question  here,  those\ntransfers nonetheless violated the Presentment Clause.  In its\nmore limited form, the Organizations’ argument is that the\ntransfers violated the separation of powers, the Presentment\nClause, and the Appropriations Clause because the transfers\nwere not authorized by § 8005.\nI need not address whether the Organizations have an\nequitable cause of action to assert the strong form of their\nconstitutional argument, because in my view that argument\non the merits is so “wholly insubstantial and frivolous” that\nit would not even give rise to federal jurisdiction.  Bell v.\nHood, 327 U.S. 678, 682–83 (1946); see also Steel Co.,\n523 U.S. at 89.  If § 8005 allowed the transfers here, then that\nnecessarily means that the Executive has properly spent funds\nthat Congress, by statute, has appropriated and allowed to be\nspent for that purpose.  Cf. Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182,\n192  (1993)  (“allocation  of  funds  from  a  lump-sum\nappropriation is another administrative decision traditionally\nregarded  as  committed  to  agency  discretion”).

See Clinton\nv. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 444 (1998).

Under Dalton v. Specter, 511 U.S. 462\n(1994),  this  theory—despite  its  constitutional  garb—is\nproperly  classified  as  “a  statutory  one,”  id.  at  474.    It\ntherefore does not fall within the scope of the asserted non-\nAPA equitable cause of action to enjoin unconstitutional\nconduct.13\nIn Dalton, the Court addressed a non-APA claim to enjoin\nExecutive  officials  from  implementing  an  allegedly\nunconstitutional Presidential decision to close certain military\nbases under the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act\nof 1990.  511 U.S. at 471.14  But the claim in Dalton was not\nthat the President had directly transgressed an applicable\nconstitutional limitation; rather, the claim was that, because\nExecutive officials “violated the procedural requirements” of\nthe  statute  on  which  the  President’s  decision  ultimately\nrested,  the  President  thereby  “act[ed]  in  excess  of  his\nstatutory  authority”  and  therefore  “violate[d]  the\n13 There remains the Organizations’ claim that statutory violations\nmay be enjoined under a non-APA ultra vires cause of action for equitable\nrelief, but that also fails for the reasons discussed below.  See infra at\n79–80.\n14 The plaintiffs in Dalton also asserted a claim under the APA itself,\nbut that claim failed for the separate reason that the challenged final action\nwas taken by the President personally, and the President is not an\n“agency” for purposes of the APA.  See 511 U.S. at 469.\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  7733  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP 73\nconstitutional separation-of-powers doctrine.”  Id. at 471–72. \nThe Supreme Court rejected this effort to “eviscerat[e]” the\nwell-established “distinction between claims that an official\nexceeded his statutory authority, on the one hand, and claims\nthat he acted in violation of the Constitution, on the other.” \nId. at 474 (emphasis added).  As the Court explained, its\n“cases do not support the proposition that every action by the\nPresident, or by another executive official, in excess of his\nstatutory  authority  is  ipso  facto  in  violation  of  the\nConstitution.”    Id.  at  472.    The  Court  distinguished\nYoungstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579\n(1952), on the ground that there “the Government disclaimed\nany statutory authority for the President’s seizure of steel\nmills,” and as a result the Constitution itself supplied the rule\nof decision for determining the legality of the President’s\nactions.  Dalton, 511 U.S. at 473.  Because the “only basis of\nauthority asserted was the President’s inherent constitutional\npower as the Executive and the Commander in Chief of the\nArmed Forces,” Youngstown thus “necessarily turned on\nwhether the Constitution authorized the President’s actions.” \nId. (emphasis added).  By contrast, given that the claim in\nDalton was that the President had violated the Constitution\nbecause Executive officials had “violated the terms of the\n1990 Act,” the terms of that statute provided the applicable\nrule of decision and the claim was therefore “a statutory one.” \nId. at 474.  And because those claims sought to enjoin\nconduct  on  the  grounds  that  it  violated  statutory\nrequirements, it was subject to the “longstanding” limitation\nthat non-APA “review is not available when the statute in\nquestion  commits  the  decision  to  the  discretion  of  the\nPresident.”  Id.\nUnder  Dalton,  the  Organizations’  purported\n“constitutional”  claims—at  least  in  their  more  limited\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  7744  ooff  8822\n74 SIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP\nversion—are properly classified as statutory claims that do\nnot  fall  within  any  non-APA  cause  of  action  to  enjoin\nunconstitutional conduct.  511 U.S. at 474.  Here, as in\nDalton, Defendants have “claimed” the “statutory authority”\nof § 8005, and any asserted violation of the Constitution\nwould occur only if, and only because, Defendants’ conduct\nis assertedly not authorized by § 8005.  Id. at 473.  The rule\nof  decision  for  this  dispute  is  thus  not  supplied,  as  in\nYoungstown, by the Constitution; rather, it is supplied only by\n§  8005.    Id.  at  473–74.    Because  these  claims  by  the\nOrganizations are thus “statutory” under Dalton, they may\nonly proceed, if at all, under an equitable cause of action to\nenjoin ultra vires conduct, and they would be subject to any\nlimitations  applicable  to such  claims.    Id. at  474.  The\nOrganizations do assert such a fallback claim here, but it fails\nfor the reasons I explain below.  See infra at 79–80.\nb\nBut even if the Organizations’ claims may properly be\nclassified as constitutional ones for purposes of the particular\nequitable cause of action they invoke here, those claims\nwould still fail.\nTo  the  extent  that  the  Organizations  argue  that  the\nConstitution itself grants a cause of action allowing any\nplaintiff with an Article III injury to sue to enjoin an alleged\nviolation  of  the  Appropriations  Clause,  the  Presentment\nClause, or the separation of powers, there is no support for\nsuch a theory.  None of the cases cited by the Organizations\ninvolved putative plaintiffs, such as the Organizations here,\nwho are near the outer perimeter of Article III standing.

McIntosh, 833 F.3d 1163, 1174–75\n(9th Cir. 2016) (criminal defendants sought to enjoin, based\non an appropriations rider and the Appropriations Clause, the\nJustice Department’s expenditure of funds to prosecute them),\nor they involved a suit based on an express statutory cause of\naction, see Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. at 428\n(noting  that  right  of  action  was  expressly  conferred  by\n2 U.S.C. § 692(a)(1) (1996 ed.)).\nMoreover,  the  majority’s  novel  contention  that  the\nConstitution  requires  recognizing,  in  this  context,  an\nequitable cause of action that extends to the outer limits of\nArticle III cannot be squared with the Supreme Court’s\ndecision  in  Armstrong  v.  Exceptional  Child  Ctr.,  Inc.,\n575 U.S. 320 (2015).  There, the Court rejected the view that\nthe Supremacy Clause itself created a private right of action\nfor equitable relief against preempted statutes, and instead\nheld that any such equitable claim rested on “judge-made”\nremedies that are subject to “express and implied statutory\nlimitations.”  Id. at 325–27.  The Supremacy Clause provides\na  particularly  apt  analogy  here,  because  (like  the\nAppropriations Clause) the asserted “unconstitutionality” of\nthe challenged action generally depends upon whether it falls\nwithin or outside the terms of a federal statute: a state statute\nis “unconstitutional under the Supremacy Clause” only if it is\n“contrary  to  federal  law,”  Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena\nAirport Auth. v. City of Burbank, 136 F.3d 1360, 1361–62\n(9th  Cir.  1998),  and  here,  the  transfers  violated  the\nAppropriations  Clause  only  if  they  were  barred  by  the\nlimitations in § 8005.  And just as the Supremacy Clause\nprotects Congress’s “broad discretion with regard to the\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  7766  ooff  8822\n76 SIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP\nenactment of laws,” Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 325–26, so too\nthe Appropriations Clause protects “congressional control\nover funds in the Treasury,” McIntosh, 833 F.3d at 1175.  It\nis “unlikely that the Constitution gave Congress such broad\ndiscretion”  to  enact  appropriations  laws  only  to\nsimultaneously  “require[]  Congress  to  permit  the\nenforcement of its laws” by any “private actor[]” with even\nminimal Article III standing, thereby “limit[ing] Congress’s\npower” to decide how “to enforce” the spending limitations\nit enacts.  Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 325–26.15\nThe Appropriations Clause thus does not itself create a\nconstitutionally required cause of action that extends to the\nlimits of Article III.  On the contrary, any equitable cause of\naction to enforce that clause would rest on a “judge-made”\nremedy: as Armstrong observed, “[t]he ability to sue to enjoin\nunconstitutional actions by state and federal officers is the\ncreation of courts of equity, and reflects a long history of\njudicial review of illegal executive action, tracing back to\nEngland.”  575 U.S. at 327.  At least where, as here, the\ncontours  of  the  applicable  constitutional  line  (under  the\n15 The majority asserts that Armstrong is distinguishable on the\ngrounds that the Appropriations Clause is supposedly more protective of\nindividual liberty than the Supremacy Clause.  See Maj. Opin. at 30–31. \nNothing is cited to support this comparative assertion, which seems highly\ndoubtful: there is no reason to think that Congress’s ability, in the exercise\nof its enumerated powers, to preempt potentially oppressive state laws is\nany less protective of individual liberty than is Congress’s ability to insert\nriders in appropriations bills.  Moreover, to the extent that these clauses\nprotect individual liberty, they both do so only as a consequence of\nprotecting  congressional  authority  within  our  overall  constitutional\nstructure.  Armstrong’s core point—that it would be “strange indeed” to\nconstrue a clause that protects congressional power as simultaneously\nsaddling  Congress  with  a  particular  enforcement  method—remains\nequally applicable to both.  575 U.S. at 326.\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  7777  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V.

Id.\nOne long-established “‘judicially self-imposed limit[] on\nthe  exercise  of  federal  jurisdiction’”—including  federal\nequitable jurisdiction—is the requirement “that a plaintiff’s\ngrievance must arguably fall within the zone of interests\nprotected  or  regulated  by  the  statutory  provision  or\nconstitutional  guarantee  invoked  in  the  suit.”    Bennett,\n520 U.S. at 162 (quoting Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 751\n(1984)).  This limitation is not confined to the APA, but\nrather reflects a “prudential standing requirement[] of general\napplication”  that  always  “applies  unless  it  is  expressly\nnegated” by Congress.  Id. at 163.16  Because Congress has\nnot expressly negated that test in any relevant respect, the\nOrganizations’  equitable  cause  of  action  to  enforce  the\nAppropriations Clause here remains subject to the zone-of-\ninterests test.  Cf. Thompson v. North American Stainless, LP,\n16 The majority wrongly contends that, by quoting this language from\nBennett, and stating that the zone-of-interests test therefore “applies to all\nstatutorily created causes of action,” Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 129 (emphasis\nadded), the Court in Lexmark thereby intended to signal that the test only\napplies to statutory claims and not to non-statutory equitable claims.  See\nMaj. Opin. at 36–37.  Nothing in Lexmark actually suggests any such\nnegative pregnant; instead, the Court’s reference to “statutorily created\ncauses of action” reflects nothing more than the fact that only statutory\nclaims were before the Court in that case.  See 572 U.S. at 129.  Moreover,\nLexmark notes that the zone-of-interests test’s roots lie in the common\nlaw, id. at 130 n.5, and Bennett (upon which Lexmark relied) states that\nthe  test  reflects  a  “prudential  standing  requirement[]  of  general\napplication” that applies to any “exercise of federal jurisdiction,” 520 U.S.\nat 162–63.\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  7788  ooff  8822\n78 SIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP\n562 U.S. 170, 176–77 (2011) (construing a cause of action as\nextending to “any person injured in the Article III sense”\nwould often produce “absurd consequences” and is for that\nreason rarely done).  And given the unique nature of an\nAppropriations  Clause  claim,  as  just  discussed,  the  line\nbetween constitutional and unconstitutional conduct here is\ndefined entirely by the limitations in § 8005, and therefore\nthe  relevant  zone  of  interests  for  the  Organizations’\nAppropriations-Clause-based equitable claim remains defined\nby  those  limitations.    Thus,  contrary  to  the  majority’s\nconclusion, see Maj. Opin. at 39–40, the Organizations are\noutside the applicable zone of interests for this claim as well.\nIn arguing for a contrary view, the Organizations rely\nheavily on United States v. McIntosh, asserting that there\nwe  granted  non-APA  injunctive  relief  based  on  the\nAppropriations  Clause  without  inquiring  whether  the\nclaimants were within the zone of interests of the underlying\nappropriations statute.  McIntosh cannot bear the considerable\nweight that the Organizations place on it.\nIn McIntosh, we asserted interlocutory jurisdiction over\nthe district courts’ refusal to enjoin the expenditure of funds\nto prosecute the defendants—an expenditure that allegedly\nviolated  an  appropriations  rider  barring  the  Justice\nDepartment from spending funds to prevent certain States\nfrom “‘implementing their own laws that authorize the use,\ndistribution,  possession,  or  cultivation  of  medical\nmarijuana.’”  833 F.3d at 1175; see also id. at 1172–73.  We\nheld that the defendants had Article III standing and that, if\nthe Department was in fact “spending money in violation” of\nthat rider in prosecuting the defendants, that would produce\na violation of the Appropriations Clause that could be raised\nby the defendants in challenging their prosecutions.  Id.\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  7799  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP 79\nat 1175.  After construing the meaning of the rider, we then\nremanded the matter for a determination whether the rider\nwas  being  violated.    Id.  at  1179.    Contrary  to  the\nOrganizations’ dog-that-didn’t-bark theory, nothing can be\ngleaned from the fact that the zone-of-interests test was never\ndiscussed in McIntosh.  See Cooper Indus., Inc. v. Aviall\nServs, Inc., 543 U.S. 157, 170 (2004) (“‘Questions which\nmerely lurk in the record, neither brought to the attention of\nthe court nor ruled upon, are not to be considered as having\nbeen  so  decided  as  to  constitute  precedents.’”)  (quoting\nWebster v. Fall, 266 U.S. 507, 511 (1925)).  Moreover, any\nsuch silence seems more likely to have been due to the fact\nthat it was so overwhelmingly obvious that the defendants\nwere within the rider’s zone of interests that the point was\nincontestable and uncontested.  An asserted interest in not\ngoing to prison for complying with state medical-marijuana\nlaws seems well within the zone of interests of a statute\nprohibiting interference with the implementation of such state\nlaws.\n2\nThe only remaining question is whether the Organizations\nmay evade the APA’s zone-of-interests test by asserting a\nnon-APA claim for ultra vires conduct in excess of statutory\nauthority.  Even assuming that such a cause of action exists\nalongside the APA, cf. Trudeau v. Federal Trade Comm’n,\n456 F.3d 178, 189–90 (D.C. Cir. 2006), I conclude that it\nwould be subject to the same zone-of-interests limitations as\nthe Organizations’ APA claims and therefore likewise fails.\nFor the same reasons discussed above, any such equitable\ncause of action rests on a judge-made remedy that is subject\nto the zone-of-interests  test.  See supra at 74–79.  The\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  8800  ooff  8822\n80 SIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP\nOrganizations identify no case from the Supreme Court or\nthis court affirmatively holding that the zone-of-interests test\ndoes not apply to a non-APA equitable cause of action to\nenjoin  conduct  allegedly  in  excess  of  express  statutory\nlimitations on statutory authority, and I am aware of none. \nIndeed, it makes little sense, when evaluating a claim that\nExecutive officials exceeded the limitations  in a federal\nstatute, not to ask whether the plaintiff is within the zone of\ninterests protected by those statutory limitations.  Cf. Haitian\nRefugee Ctr. v. Gracey, 809 F.2d 794, 811 n.14 (D.C. Cir.\n1987) (although plaintiff asserting ultra vires claim may not\nneed to show that its interests “fall within the zones of\ninterests of the constitutional and statutory powers invoked”\nby Executive officials, when “a particular constitutional or\nstatutory provision was intended to protect persons like the\nlitigant  by  limiting  the  authority  conferred,”  then  “the\nlitigant’s interest may be said to fall within the zone protected\nby  the  limitation”)  (emphasis  added).17    Here,  those\nlimitations are supplied by § 8005, and the Organizations are\nnot within the zone of interests of that statute.18\n17 The majority thus relies on the wrong portion of Judge Bork’s\nopinion in Haitian Refugee Center.  See Maj. Opin. at 37–39.  This case\nturns on a “statutory provision” that “limit[s] the authority conferred.” \n809 F.2d at 811 n.14.  If the Executive had contended that it had power to\ntransfer the funds regardless of § 8005, then this case would look more\nlike Youngstown, but no such extravagant claim has been pressed in this\ncase.  On the contrary, Defendants concede that, if the requirements of\n§ 8005 were not met, then the transfers were unlawful.\n18 Even if the Organizations were correct that the zone-of-interests test\ndoes not apply to a non-APA equitable cause of action, that would not\nnecessarily  mean  that  such  equitable  jurisdiction  extends,  as  the\nOrganizations suggest, to the outer limits of Article III.  Declining to apply\nthe  APA’s  generous  zone-of-interests  test  might  arguably  render\napplicable the sort of narrower review of agency action that preceded the\n\nCCaassee:  41:91-91-6c1v0-020, 80962/2-H6/S2G02  0 D, IoDc:u 1m1e7n3t4 259209 ,   DFikletEdn 0tr6y/:2 168/270-1  ,  PPaaggee  8811  ooff  8822\nSIERRA CLUB V. TRUMP 81\n*     *     *\nGiven that each of the Organizations’ asserted theories\nfail, the Organizations lack any cause of action to challenge\nthe DoD’s transfer of funds under § 8005.\nIV\nAlternatively, even if the Organizations had a cause of\naction, their claims would fail on the merits, because the\nchallenged transfers did not violate § 8005 or § 9002.  In the\ncompanion  appeal,  California  v.  Trump,  the  majority\nconcluded that § 8005 and § 9002 did not authorize the\ntransfers at issue, and I concluded that these provisions did\nauthorize the transfers.  Just as the majority “reaffirm[s] this\nholding  here  and  conclude[s]  that  Section  8005  did  not\nauthorize the transfer of funds,” Maj. Opin. at 24, I reaffirm\nmy previous conclusion that § 8005 and § 9002 authorized\nthe transfers.\nV\nBased on the foregoing, I conclude that at least the Sierra\nClub has Article III standing, but that the Organizations lack\nany cause of action to challenge these § 8005 and § 9002\ntransfers.  Alternatively, if the Organizations did have a cause\nof action, their claims fail on the merits as a matter of law\nbecause the transfers complied with the limitations in § 8005\nand § 9002.  I therefore would reverse the district court’s\npartial grant of summary judgment to the Organizations and\nwould  remand  the  matter  with  instructions  to  grant\nAPA standards articulated in Data Processing, 397 U.S. at 153.
