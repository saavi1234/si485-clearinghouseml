    "summary": "<p>On March 27, 2018, four nonprofit fair housing organizations filed this suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs sued Facebook under the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3613; two of the plaintiffs also sued under the New York City Human Rights Law. Represented by private and in-house counsel, the plaintiffs alleged that Facebook created categories on its advertising platform that facilitated unlawful housing discrimination in housing ads and sought declaratory and injunctive relief, damages, and attorney’s fees. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that Facebook’s advertising tools allowed users to target ads based on sex, family status, disability, national origin, and other protected characteristics in violation of the Fair Housing Act and New York City’s anti-discrimination laws. </p><p>This case developed from a series of investigations into Facebook’s advertising tools by the plaintiffs (the National Fair Housing Alliance, the Fair Housing Justice Center, Inc., the Housing Opportunities Project for Excellence, Inc., and the Fair Housing Council of Greater San Antonio). The plaintiffs created and submitted their own ads to Facebook in New York, Washington, D.C., Miami, and San Antonio. According to the plaintiffs, their experiments showed that Facebook allowed advertisers to exclude families with children, women, and users with interests based on disability and national origin. For example, the National Fair Housing Alliance posted ads for a fictional real estate company and requested it not be shown to “parents with toddlers,” “parents with preschoolers,” “parents with early school-age children,” “moms of grade school kids,” and “moms of high school kids;” the Alliance claimed that by combining these exclusions, advertisers could discriminate against people with children. The plaintiffs then conducted similar experiments in other jurisdictions using other protected criteria. (Facebook had previously removed certain race-based targeting methods because of an earlier <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-lets-advertisers-exclude-users-by-race\">controversy</a> about “affinity marketing.”) </p><p>On June 4, 2018, the defendants motioned to transfer the case to the Northern District of California or, alternatively, to dismiss the case. Facebook argued that, by agreeing to its terms of use when creating their Facebook accounts, the plaintiffs agreed to have their suits litigated in California. Facebook also argued under the first-filed rule that <i>Onuoha v. Facebook</i>, a pending suit in California, had priority over the plaintiffs’ suit. In addition, Facebook argued that the court did not have personal jurisdiction and that the plaintiffs did not have standing. Finally, Facebook argued that it was immune from suit under the Communications Decency Act and that the plaintiffs failed to allege discriminatory conduct by Facebook itself. </p><p>On June 25, 2018, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. The plaintiffs clarified their original complaint by alleging that Facebook provides a service related to \"the business of selling or renting dwellings\" under the Fair Housing Act and that its creation of categories was discriminatory. The court (Judge John G. Koeltl) denied Facebook’s motion to transfer or dismiss as moot on July 2, 2018, likely because of the plaintiffs’ amendment. Later that month, Facebook again moved to transfer or dismiss. </p><p>Over the course of the fall, the parties briefed the pending motions. They also engaged in settlement talks that yielded a motion to dismiss by the plaintiffs on February 6, 2019, and a motion to re-open the case to enter the settlement on March 16. </p><p>In March 2019, <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/03/facebook-settles-civil-rights-lawsuits-over-ad-discrimination/\">Facebook reached settlements</a> in three civil rights cases and two complaints before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over ad discrimination on its platform. The settlement included National Fair Housing Alliance v. Facebook (S.D.N.Y), <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17161\">Communications Workers of America v. Facebook (EEOC)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17159\">Spees v. Facebook (EEOC)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15527\">Mobley v. Facebook (N.D. Cal.)</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17157\">Riddick v. Facebook (N.D. Cal.)</a>, all available on the Clearinghouse. Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg commented on the settlement in a blog post: “There is a long history of discrimination in the areas of housing, employment, and credit, and this harmful behavior should not happen through Facebook ads…We can do better.” Sandburg attributed the civil rights audit in Facebook’s decision to settle. </p><p>Pursuant to the settlement agreement, specific to National Fair Housing Alliance, Facebook agreed to pay $1,950,000 to plaintiffs for alleged damages. Additionally, Facebook agreed to provide $500,000 in credit for advertising on Facebook to the plaintiffs. Facebook also agreed to create and administer to certain employees a training program on federal housing law in consultation with the National Fair Housing Alliance. The parties agreed that the plaintiffs could continue to run test ads on Facebook to monitor the efficacy of Facebook’s policy changes. And Facebook agreed to meet with the National Fair Housing Alliance at least once every six months to review Facebook’s ad targeting policies.  </p><p>The parties agreed that Hunter Hughes III or another mutually agreeable mediator would resolve disputes about implementing the settlement agreement before the parties would return to court. The duration of the settlement was defined as a three-year period from the date that Facebook implemented certain reforms about ad creation specified in the agreement. The court approved the settlement on March 29, 2019 and retained jurisdiction to enforce it. </p><p>The terms of the settlement included promises by Facebook to make significant changes to their advertising tools to curb the availability of advertisers to target users based on protected characteristics. The changes will affect Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger. Facebook agreed to create a separate portal for ads in areas of housing, employment and credit. The parties agreed to monitor the changes for three years and to study the potential that the algorithm creates unintended bias. Finally, Facebook promised to change how it targets audiences for advertisements without using protected classes like race and gender to generate an audience. </p><p>As of April 2020, the settlement was being enforced.</p><p></p>",

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n1. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act (“FHA”), a statute \nintended to end discrimination in housing markets throughout the United States.  For decades, \nthe FHA has prohibited both publishers and advertisers from “targeting” ads based on sex, \nfamily status, disability, national origin, and other protected characteristics.\n2. Given this milestone, it is all the more egregious and shocking that Defendant \nFacebook continues to enable landlords and real estate brokers to bar families with children, \nwomen, and others from receiving rental and sales ads for housing.  Facebook has created a pre-\npopulated list of demographics, behaviors, and interests that makes it possible for housing \nadvertisers to exclude certain home seekers from ever seeing their ads.  Facebook’s conduct is \nillegal under the FHA.\n3. Housing advertising has of course changed in the last fifty years, moving beyond \nbillboards, “for rent” signs, and classifieds in the newspaper, to online advertising.  Facebook’s \nability to customize an online audience for advertisements based on its vast trove of user data has \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689   Document 1   Filed 03/27/18   Page 2 of 52\nmade it the biggest advertising agency in the world—the advertising platform of choice for \nmillions of businesses.  But Facebook has abused its enormous power. \n4. Over the past months, Plaintiffs, four nonprofit organizations with the common \nmission of eliminating housing discrimination and promoting residential integration, investigated \nFacebook’s conduct.  Plaintiffs created dozens of housing advertisements and completed \nFacebook’s full ad submission and review process.  Plaintiffs’ investigations in New York, \nWashington D.C., Miami, and San Antonio confirm that Facebook first provides the option for \nadvertisers to exclude families with children and women from receiving advertisements, as well \nas users with interests based on disability and national origin.  Then Facebook approves and \npermits advertisers to publish these ads in a discriminatory manner without consumers ever \nknowing they have been excluded.\n5. Discriminatory advertising is just as damaging as discrimination at the point of \nrental or sale.  If women with school-age children are categorically excluded from the Facebook \nadvertising audience for a rental apartment in a community with high-performing schools and \nother amenities, they are effectively denied access to that housing opportunity.  Facebook and its \nadvertisers have made the ad invisible to them.  At the same time, Facebook’s ad platform can \nfurther that same landlord’s illegal efforts to maintain a segregated, adults-only rental \ncomplex.  Whereas in the past, the excluded group might see the “for rent” sign or newspaper \nclassified ad because the ads were located in a public forum, the stealth nature of Facebook’s \ntechnology hides housing ads from entire groups of people.  Facebook’s algorithms can ensure \nexclusion and deny access to housing.  As technology develops, Facebook’s precise ability to \ntarget groups and promote discrimination will surely only grow.\n2\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689   Document 1   Filed 03/27/18   Page 3 of 52\n6. Even before Plaintiffs conducted their most recent investigations, Facebook was \non notice for more than a year—from Plaintiffs and media reports (including by ProPublica)—\nthat its advertising platform violated fair housing laws.\n7. As Facebook significantly increases its presence in housing advertising and the \nhousing marketplace,1 it must first end its discriminatory advertising practices. \nII. JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n8. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, as \nPlaintiffs assert federal claims under the FHA; under 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(4) as Plaintiffs seek to \nsecure equitable and other relief under federal civil rights laws; and under \n42 U.S.C. § 3613(a)(1)(A) as Plaintiffs seek appropriate relief regarding a discriminatory \nhousing practice under the Fair Housing Act. \n9. The Court has supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ local law claims under \nthe New York City Human Rights Law pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a), as these claims are so \nrelated to their federal claims in this action that they form part of the same case or controversy. \n10. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Facebook pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. \n4(k)(1) and New York Civil Practice Law and Rules § 302(a)(1) because Facebook transacts \nbusiness within the state, § 302(a)(2) because Facebook has committed tortious and \ndiscriminatory acts within the state, § 302(a)(3)(i) because Facebook has committed a tortious \nand discriminatory act without the state causing injury to persons within the state, and regularly \ndoes business in the state, § 302(a)(3)(ii) because Facebook has committed a tortious and \ndiscriminatory act without the state causing injury to persons within the state, and derives \nsubstantial revenue from interstate commerce, and § 302(a)(4). \n1 Ben Lane, Facebook Launches Massive Push Into Real Estate Listings, Housingwire.com (Nov. 13, 2017), \nhttps://www.housingwire.com/articles/41797-facebook-launches-massive-push-into-real-estate-listings. \n3\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689   Document 1   Filed 03/27/18   Page 4 of 52\n11. Declaratory and injunctive relief is sought and authorized by 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 \nand 2202. \n12. Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1), as Defendant \nFacebook resides in this District in which it is subject to the Court’s personal jurisdiction, and \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) in that a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise \nto Plaintiffs’ claims occurred in this District. \nA. Facebook’s Contacts with New York  \n13. Facebook maintains a corporate office in this District located at 335 Madison \nAvenue, New York, New York, 10017. \n14. Facebook is registered with the New York State Division of Corporations and \nassigned DOS ID #3842367l, with an appointed agent for service located at 80 State Street, \nAlbany, New York, 12207. \n15. Upon information and belief, Facebook employs approximately 1,000 people. \n16. Facebook opened its New York office in 2012, stating that the New York office \n“won’t just be a satellite office, it will be a core part of our engineering staff.”2\n17. Facebook conducts advertising, engineering, and other activities in this District. \n18. According to Facebook, “Almost all of our big teams are centered around \nproducts that specifically benefit from being in New York . . . either teams working closely with \nlocal industries, products that address the experience of an urban environment, or center around \ntalent that is abundant on the east coast (like AI Research or Mobile Engineering).”3\n2 Jason Kincaid, Facebook To Open Engineering Office in NYC, techcrunch.com (Dec. 2, 2011), \nhttps://techcrunch.com/2011/12/02/facebook-to-open-engineering-office-in-nyc.\n3 Director of Engineering at Facebook AI Explains the Advantages of New York Tech, Huffington Post.com (Jan. \n22, 2016), https://www.huffingtonpost.com/quora/director-of-engineering-a_b_9052764.html (emphasis supplied). \n4\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689   Document 1   Filed 03/27/18   Page 5 of 52\n19. As the largest city in the United States, New York City—with a total of more than \n3 million households according to the 2010 United States Census—is also the largest housing \nmarket in the country.4  As of 2011, New York City had a total of 3.35 million housing units, of \nwhich 65% were rental units, 30% were owner units, and 5% were vacant but not available for \nsale or rent.  The vacancy rate in 2011 for rental units in New York City was only 3.12%.  Half \nof the City’s housing units were in buildings of 20 or more units as of 2011.   \n20. The New York City housing market is unique in that, unlike other cities in the \nUnited States where landlords handle advertising and renting apartments directly, many \nlandlords use real estate agents to advertise apartments for rent and locate prospective renters.  \nAs of 2013, Manhattan alone had 27,000 licensed real estate brokers and sales persons working \nin both the sales and rental markets.5  These real estate brokers and agents use online real estate \nadvertising, including on Facebook.   \n21. For the New York City housing consumer, access to Facebook’s online real estate \nadvertising is crucial given the City’s low vacancy rate, high competition for dwelling units, and \nheavy reliance on real estate brokers and agents. \n22. Upon information and belief, Facebook receives a substantial amount of revenue \nfrom advertisements that are sold to New York area companies or target New York residents, \nincluding an estimated reach of millions of people within the District. \n23. Upon information and belief, a portion of this substantial revenue comes from \nhousing advertisements that are sold to landlords and real estate brokers in the New York area \nand target New York residents.  \n4 New York City Consolidated Plan, 2015-2-19 Needs Assessment & Market Analysis, December 16, 2016, NA-1. \n5 Leigh Kamping-Carder, Ranks of Manhattan brokers swell, as market strengthens, The Real Deal (Dec. 10, 2012), \navailable at https://therealdeal.com/2012/12/10/ranks-of-new-york-city-brokers-swell-as-market-strengthens/.  \n5\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689   Document 1   Filed 03/27/18   Page 6 of 52\nIII.

LEGAL BACKGROUND: DISCRIMINATORY ADVERTISING \n34. The Fair Housing Act states that it shall be unlawful “[t]o make, print, or publish, \nor cause to be made, printed, or published any notice, statement, or advertisement, with respect \nto the sale or rental of a dwelling that indicates any preference, limitation, or discrimination \nbased on race, color, religion, sex, handicap,8 familial status, or national origin, or an intention to \nmake any such preference, limitation, or discrimination.”  42 U.S.C. § 3604(c). \n35. Under its implementing regulations, the FHA provides that:\n“(c) Discriminatory  notices,  statements  and  advertisements \ninclude,  but  are  not  limited  to:  (1) Using  words,  phrases, \nphotographs,  illustrations,  symbols  or  forms  which  convey  that \ndwellings are available or not available to a particular group of \npersons because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial \nstatus, or national origin . . . (3) Selecting media or locations for \nadvertising the sale or rental of dwellings which deny particular \nsegments  of  the  housing  market  information  about  housing \nopportunities  because  of  race,  color,  religion,  sex,  handicap, \nfamilial  status,  or  national  origin.  (4) Refusing  to  publish \nadvertising for the sale or rental of dwellings . . . because of race, \ncolor, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin.  \n 24 C.F.R. § 100.75. \n36. The Fair Housing Act’s advertising prohibitions apply to “all written or oral \nnotices or statements by a person engaged in the sale or rental of a dwelling” which include “any \napplications, flyers, brochures, deeds, signs, banners, posters, billboards, or any documents used \nwith respect to the sale or rental of a dwelling.”  24 C.F.R. § 100.75(b). \n7See Facebook Marketplace to Post Apartment List Rental Homes, naahq.org (Nov. 9, 2017), \nhttps://www.naahq.org/news-publications/facebook-marketplace-post-apartmentlist-rental-homes .  \n8 Hereinafter, the term “disability” shall be used for the term “handicap.” \n9\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689   Document 1   Filed 03/27/18   Page 10 of 52\n37. In the advertising context, these prohibitions apply to both the person who drafted \nor placed the ad as well as the publisher of the ad because the negative effect of discriminatory \nadvertising would be magnified if widely circulated by newspapers and other mass media.  See\nUnited States v. Hunter, 459 F.2d 205, 215 (4th Cir. 1972).  Under the FHA, illegal advertising \npractices not only discourage or prevent buyers and renters from accessing information about \nhousing opportunities, but also create an impression that housing segregation is legal, thus \nfacilitating future discrimination by others.  SeeSpann v. Colonial Village, Inc., 899 F.2d 24, 29 \n(D.C. Cir. 1990).\n38. It is black-letter law that publishing advertisements that indicate discriminatory \npreferences is illegal. See Ragin v. New York Times, 923 F.2d 995 (2d Cir. 1991).\n39. The continuing presence of discriminatory advertising practices serves to \nencourage both the housing provider and the home seeker to believe housing discrimination is \n“an accepted norm despite the FHA’s pronouncements to the contrary.”  Schwemm, Robert, \nDiscriminatory Housing Statements and § 3604(c): A New Look at the Fair Housing Act’s Most \nIntriguing Provision, 29 Fordham Urb. L. J. 187, 250 (2001).  \nV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA. Facebook’s Powerful and Far-Reaching Advertising Platform\n40. Facebook generated over $40 billion dollars in revenue last year, almost all of \nwhich was made through selling advertisements on its website.\n41. Facebook’s platform provides advertisers with “a number of different ways to \nengage with people on Facebook, the most important of which is the News Feed which displays \nan algorithmically-ranked series of stories and advertisements individualized for each person.”9\n9 Facebook Investor Relations,  https://investor.fb.com/financials/sec-filings-details/default.aspx?FilingId=12512043 \n(Facebook, Inc. Annual Report for the Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2017).   \n10\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689   Document 1   Filed 03/27/18   Page 11 of 52\n42. As Facebook promotes itself to its prospective advertisers, its greatest advertising \nasset is its user base of over 2 billion people.10  This user base includes not only Facebook users, \nbut users of other applications owned by Facebook, including Instagram.  Facebook collects a \nremarkable amount of information about each one of these users.  It gathers this information both \nthrough self-reported information on Facebook, and through tracking its users’ online activity—\nboth on Facebook itself and elsewhere through the internet.  The end result has been described as \n“arguably the most complete consumer profile on earth,”11 as it reflects each Facebook user’s \ndemographics, location, interests, and online behaviors.\n43. Facebook then uses this treasure trove of information to enable advertisers to \n“target the people who are right for [their] business.”12\n44. Using its vast collection of user data, Facebook has created a platform that \nenables advertisers to seek out potential audiences with great specificity.  Advertisers can target \nusers based on information as general as geographic location, or as specific as their birthday. \n1. Facebook’s Use of “Include” and “Exclude” Options \n45. Facebook has designed its advertising platform so that advertisers can “target” \ntheir audience using two general actions—“including” specific types of people and “excluding” \nspecific types of people. \n46. Facebook develops and provides its advertisers with a pre-populated list of \nhundreds of demographics, behaviors, and interests (the “Facebook Pre-Populated List”).  \n10 https://www.facebook.com/business/products/ads (last visited March 21, 2018). \n11 Caitlin Dewey, 98 personal data points that Facebook uses to target ads to you, Wash. Post (Aug. 19, 2016), \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/08/19/98-personal-data-points-that-facebook-uses-to-\ntarget-ads-to-you/?utm_term=.58ce94764ccf .  \n12 https://www.facebook.com/business/products/ads/ad-targeting (last visited March 21, 2018). \n11\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689   Document 1   Filed 03/27/18   Page 12 of 52\nAdvertisers then scroll through this Facebook-created content and select which characteristics \nthey would like to “include” and which they would like “exclude” from the ad’s audience. \n47. For example, when an advertiser checks the pre-populated box to “include” the \ndemographic of parents with toddlers (01-02), parents with toddlers (01-02) become the target \naudience for the ad and only parents will receive the ad on their Facebook pages or in their News \nFeeds.  Non-parents will not receive the ad. \n48. When an advertiser “excludes” a specific demographic, behavior, or interest, no \nperson who reflects that quality will receive the ad.  If an advertiser checks the pre-populated \nbox to exclude people who have an interest in cooking, no one with that interest will receive the \nadvertisement on their Facebook page or in their News Feed.  \n49. These features can also be used simultaneously.  For example, if an advertiser \n“includes” parents but also “excludes” people with an interest in cooking, the ad will only appear \non the Facebook pages or in the News Feeds of parents who do not have an interest in cooking. \nNon-parents (who are excluded because they were not “included” in the “target” audience) and \npeople with an interest in cooking (who were “excluded” even if they otherwise would be in the \ntarget audience) will not receive the ad. \n50. As advertisers add and subtract groups from their potential audience, Facebook \nprovides them with real time estimates of how many people can view their advertisements.  A \nscreenshot of how this appears on Facebook’s platform is attached hereto as Exhibit A. \n51. Facebook has placed these features on at least two different advertising \nplatforms—by “boosting” posts and through Facebook Ad Manager.\n12\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689   Document 1   Filed 03/27/18   Page 13 of 52\n2. Facebook’s Use of “Boosts” \n52. In order to “boost” a post, a business will first create a post to be published on its \nFacebook page.  This could be information about the business, a new promotion—anything that \nthe business would like to share with its customers.   \n53. The advertiser may then pay to “boost” that post by having it appear as an \nadvertisement on the Facebook pages or in the News Feeds of various other Facebook users.   \n54. To select which Facebook users receive that “boosted” advertisement, the \nbusiness may use the same “inclusion” and “exclusion” features described above.\n55. While any Facebook user may view the ad on the business’s Facebook page, only \nusers in the audience selected by the advertiser will receive a “boosted” advertisement on their \nown Facebook pages or in their news feeds.   \n56. For example, a restaurant may post about a new addition to its menu on its \nFacebook page.  It could then “boost” that post to an “included” or “targeted” audience—i.e., \npersons who live within 10 miles of the restaurant and have an interest in Italian food—both \ncategories in the Facebook Pre-Populated List.  In this circumstance, any Facebook user could \nview the post by navigating to the restaurant’s Facebook page, but only those in the targeted \naudience would receive the advertisement on their own pages or in their News Feeds.  \n3. Facebook “Ad Manager” \n57. Facebook also offers its advertisers the option to use Facebook Ad Manager.  \nUsing Ad Manager, an advertiser can customize exactly who will receive its advertisement, as \nwell as various other features such as where and how frequently the ad appears on the Facebook \naccounts of its targeted audience.  In this circumstance, only the audience selected using the \n“inclusion” and “exclusion” features above will be able to view the ad.  \n13\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689   Document 1   Filed 03/27/18   Page 14 of 52\n58. For example, a restaurant could create an advertisement using Ad Manager for a \nnew menu item and then select its audience using the “inclusion” and “exclusion” features—i.e., \n“include” persons who live within ten miles of the restaurant and have an interest in Italian food \nbut “exclude” persons with an interest in cooking.  In this circumstance only persons who live \nwithin ten miles of the restaurant, have an interest in Italian food, but do not have an interest in \ncooking, will be able to view the post.\nB. ProPublica Reveals Facebook’s Discriminatory Housing Advertising \nPlatform \n59. On October 28, 2016, the investigative news nonprofit ProPublica published an \narticle reporting that Facebook’s online platform enabled advertisers to exclude Facebook users \nassigned black, Hispanic and other “ethnic affinities” from seeing advertisements in the housing \ncategory through its advertising portal.13\n60. In response to ProPublica’s article, NFHA investigated Facebook’s practices. \n61. On November 3, 2016, NFHA created an advertisement using Facebook Ad \nManager.  The ad was for a fictitious apartment for rent and NFHA selected for it to be \nadvertised across the United States.  Using the “exclusions” feature within Ad Manager, NFHA \nselected the demographic preset options of “African-Americans” and “Hispanics” to exclude \nAfrican-Americans and Hispanics from the ad’s potential audience.  Facebook approved this ad.\nNFHA was able to run its ad for three days.  A screenshot of these demographic preset options is \nattached hereto as Exhibit B. \n62. On November 3, 2016, NFHA sent Facebook a letter stating that Facebook’s \nadvertising features appeared to violate the FHA and state laws, and that it was “illegal for an \n13 Julia Angwin and Terry Parris Jr., Facebook Lets Advertisers Exclude Users By Race, Propublica.org (Oct. 28, \n2016), https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-lets-advertisers-exclude-users-by-race.  \n14\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689   Document 1   Filed 03/27/18   Page 15 of 52\nonline advertiser to filter housing-related advertising in a discriminatory manner on the basis of \nrace, religion, national origin and other protected characteristics.” \n63. On November 7, 2016, Facebook’s representative responded to NFHA via email \nstating: “We think ethnic affinity marketing is really valuable in promoting diversity of the \nvoices and images on our platform, but we also understand the concerns we’re hearing about \nwrongful discrimination.  At this point, we’re listening to stakeholders like you and considering \nthe way forward.” \n64. On November 10, 2016, NFHA met with Facebook representatives with regard to \nthe discriminatory advertising platform.  NFHA explained to the Facebook representatives \npresent that the Fair Housing Act and civil rights laws prohibited any system which excluded \ncertain categories of people from viewing advertisements for housing, employment or credit.  \nNFHA requested that Facebook cease and remedy its discriminatory behavior. \n65. On November 11, 2016, NFHA sent Facebook citations to legal cases regarding \nits liability for its advertising platform. \n66. On November 11, 2016, Facebook posted a statement on its “Newsroom” titled \n“Improving Enforcement and Promoting Diversity: Updates to Ethnic Affinity Marketing,” in \nwhich it stated that it would “disable the use of ethnic affinity marketing for ads that we identify \nas offering housing, employment or credit.”14\n67. On February 8, 2017, Facebook published a statement on its website titled, \n“Improving Enforcement and Promoting Diversity: Updates to Ads Policies and Tools.”15\n14 Erin Egan, Improving Enforcement and Promoting Diversity: Updates to Ethnic Affinity Marketing,\nnewsroom.fb.com, (Nov. 11, 2016), https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/11/updates-to-ethnic-affinity-marketing/.  \n15Improving Enforcement and Promoting Diversity: Updates to Ads Policies and Tools, newsroom.fb.com, (Feb. 8, \n2017), https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/02/improving-enforcement-and-promoting-diversity-updates-to-ads-\npolicies-and-tools/.  \n15\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689   Document 1   Filed 03/27/18   Page 16 of 52\nFacebook committed to end the use of “ethnic affinity marketing” for ads that it identified as \noffering housing, employment, or credit.  For ads that use Facebook’s other exclusion and \ninclusion categories, Facebook said it would require housing, employment, and credit advertisers \nto “self-certify” that their ads complied with anti-discrimination laws. \n68. In its self-certification feature, Facebook states that “when running an ad for an \napartment for rent, it may be illegal to exclude people who have children from that \nopportunity.”16\n69. On November 21, 2017, more than a year after its original report, ProPublica \npublished a second story revealing that Facebook continued to create content enabling housing \nadvertisers to exclude users by prohibited categories such as race and national origin.17\n70. ProPublica reported that it had bought dozens of rental housing ads on Facebook, \nbut asked that they not be shown to certain categories of users, such as African-Americans, \nmothers of high school kids, people interested in wheelchair ramps, Jews, expats from Argentina, \nand Spanish speakers.  Facebook had approved all of these ads.   \n71. Based on Facebook’s prior announcement that it would end the use of “ethnic \naffinity marketing” for housing opportunities, Facebook should have rejected the ads purchased \nby ProPublica that excluded viewers on the basis of race.  The other ads should have prompted a \nscreen to pop up asking for self-certification.  ProPublica reported that it never encountered a \nself-certification screen, and Facebook rejected none of its ads.\n16Id.\n17 Julia Angwin, Ariana Tobin and Madeleine Varner, Facebook (Still) Letting Housing Advertisers Exclude Users \nby Race, propublica.org (Nov. 21, 2017), https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-advertising-discrimination-\nhousing-race-sex-national-origin.  \n16\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689   Document 1   Filed 03/27/18   Page 17 of 52\nC. Plaintiffs’ Investigation Into Facebook’s Housing Advertising Platform \nConfirms Discriminatory Practices Continue \n72. In response to ProPublica’s November 21, 2017 report, NFHA commenced an \ninvestigation into Facebook’s advertising practices.\n73. On November 30, 2017, NFHA created a Facebook page for a non-existent real \nestate company entitled “Metro Boutique Rentals.”  Through this page, NFHA staff viewed \nFacebook’s Ad Manager and Boost features. \n74. In summary, NFHA’s initial investigation into Facebook’s practices found as \nfollows: \na. The Facebook Pre-Populated List provided housing advertisers with the option of \nexcluding potential audience members from housing ads on the basis of demographic \ncategories that Facebook created, including race and national origin.\nb. At some point, Facebook eliminated the option from the Facebook Pre-Populated List \nfor housing advertisers to exclude potential audience members from housing \nopportunities on the basis of race and national origin.    \nc. The Facebook Pre-Populated List made it possible for housing advertisers to exclude \npeople from seeing their ads on the basis of their family status in a variety of ways.  It \nprovided checkboxes that housing advertisers could use to remove persons from their \npotential audience, such as parents with toddlers (01-02), parents with preschoolers \n(03-05), parents with early school-age children (06-08), moms of grade school kids, \nand moms of high school kids.  A screenshot of how these exclusions appear on \nFacebook’s Boost and Ad Manager features is attached hereto as Exhibit C.\nd. The Facebook Pre-Populated List made it possible for housing advertisers to \n“include” potential audience members based on an interest in “no kids.” \n17\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689   Document 1   Filed 03/27/18   Page 18 of 52\ne. The Facebook Pre-Populated List enabled housing advertisers to exclude people from \nseeing their ads on the basis of sex.  It provided checkboxes that housing advertisers \ncould use to exclude either men or women from viewing their ads by checking the \nbox to “include” the other.  A screenshot of how these exclusions appear on \nFacebook’s Boost and Ad Manager features is attached hereto as Exhibit D.\nf. The Facebook Pre-Populated List enabled housing advertisers to exclude on the basis \nof interests that are the equivalent of protected characteristics, such as: Interest in \nDisabled American Veteran, Interest in Disabled Parking Permit, Interest in \nDisability.gov, Interest in Telemundo, and Interest in English as a second language.  \nScreenshots of how these exclusions on Facebook’s Boost and Ad Manager features \nare attached hereto as Exhibit E. \ng. Facebook had created algorithms to provide “suggested” audiences to advertisers \nbased on the audiences selected in their prior ads.  Facebook’s “suggestions” included \ndemographic and interest categories that discriminate on the basis of protected \ncharacteristics such as sex, familial status, disability, race, or national origin. \n1. Facebook’s Discrimination in the Washington, D.C. Housing Market \na. Boost Investigation\n75. On January 2, 2018, NFHA created an ad for a fictitious apartment for rent and \nthen used Facebook’s Boost feature to promote the ad in Washington, D.C.  Using the Facebook \nPre-Populated List and the “exclusions” feature within Boost, NFHA selected the preset options \nof those with interests in the “National Association for Bikers with a Disability,” “Disabled \nAmerican Veterans,” “Disability.gov,” and “Disabled Parking Permit” to exclude from the \nBoost’s potential audience.   Facebook estimated that the Boost would reach 1.2 million people.   \n18\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689   Document 1   Filed 03/27/18   Page 19 of 52\n76. On January 2, 2018, NFHA created an ad for a fictitious apartment for rent and \nthen used Facebook’s Boost feature to promote the ad in Washington, D.C.  Using the Facebook \nPre-Populated List  and the “exclusions” feature within Boost, NFHA selected the preset options \nof those with interests in “Telemundo,” “English as a second language,” and “Univision \nDeports” to exclude from the Boost’s potential audience.  Facebook estimated that the Boost \nwould reach 1.2 million people.   \n77. On January 3, 2018, NFHA created an ad for a fictitious apartment for rent and \nthen used Facebook’s Boost feature to target the ad to the Washington, D.C. market.  Using the \nFacebook Pre-Populated List and the “inclusion” feature within Boost, NFHA selected the preset \ndemographic option of “men,” thereby excluding women from the Boost’s potential audience.  \nFacebook estimated that the Boost would reach 500,000 people.\n78. On January 3, 2018, NFHA created an ad for a fictitious apartment for rent and \nthen used Facebook’s Boost feature to target the ad to the Washington, D.C market.  Using the \nFacebook Pre-Populated List and the “exclusions” feature within Boost, NFHA selected the \npreset demographic options of “parents with toddlers (01-02 years), parents with preschoolers \n(03-05 years), parents with early school-age children (06-08 years), and parents with preteens \n(13-18 years)” to exclude families with young children from the Boost’s potential audience.  \nFacebook estimated that the Boost would reach 1.2 million people.   \n79. In January 2018 and February 2018, NFHA created multiple ads for fictitious \napartments for rent and again used Facebook’s Boost feature to target each ad to the Washington, \nD.C market.  NFHA then used the Facebook Pre-Populated List and the “exclusion” features \nwithin Boost to select multiple combinations of the  preset demographic options of “parents with \ntoddlers (01-02),” “parents with preschoolers (03-05),” “parents with early school-age children \n19\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689   Document 1   Filed 03/27/18   Page 20 of 52\n(06-08),” “parents with teenagers (13-18),” “parents with preteens (08-12),” “corporate moms,” \n“stay-at-home moms,” “moms of grade school kids,” “moms of high school kids,” “fit moms,” \n“green moms,” “big-city moms,” “trendy moms,” “soccer moms,” and “moms of preschool kids”  \nto exclude families with young children and mothers from the Boost’s potential audience.  In \nmany of these Boosts and in additional Boosts targeted to the Washington, D.C. market, NFHA \nused the Facebook Pre-Populated List and the “inclusion” feature within Boost to select the \npreset demographic option of “men,” thereby excluding women from the Boosts’ potential \naudience.  Facebook estimated that these Boosts would reach anywhere from 58,000 to 580,000 \npeople.\nb. Ad Manager Investigation\n80. On December 14, 2017, NFHA created an ad using Facebook Ad Manager for a \nfictitious apartment for rent.  NFHA selected Washington, D.C. as the market for the ad to run in.\nUsing the Facebook Pre-Populated List and the “exclusions” feature within Ad Manager, NFHA \nselected the preset demographic options of “new parents (0-12 months)” and “parents with \npreschoolers (03-05)” to exclude families with young children from the ad’s potential audience.\nFacebook estimated that the ad would reach 77,000 people.   \n81. Throughout February 2018, NFHA created additional ads for fictitious apartments \nfor rent using Facebook Ad Manager and again selected Washington, D.C. as the market for the \nads to run in.  Using the Facebook Pre-Populated List and the “exclusions” feature within Ad \nManager, NFHA selected combinations of the preset options of “corporate moms,” “stay-at-\nhome moms,” “moms of grade school kids,” “moms of high school kids,” “fit moms,” “green \nmoms,” “big-city moms,” “trendy moms,” “soccer moms” and “moms of preschool kids” to \nexclude mothers from the ad’s potential audience.  In many of these ads and in additional ads \ntargeted to the Washington, D.C. market, NFHA used the Facebook Pre-Populated List and the \n20\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689   Document 1   Filed 03/27/18   Page 21 of 52\n“inclusion” feature within Ad Manager to select the preset demographic option of “men,” \nthereby excluding women from the ad’s potential audience.  Facebook estimated that these ads \nwould reach anywhere from 48,000 to 820,000 people.   \nc. Investigation of Other Major Housing Markets  \n82. In light of its investigation of Facebook’s practices in the Washington, D.C. \nhousing market, NFHA investigated other major housing markets across the United States.  \n83. On February 1, 2018, NFHA created four ads for fictitious apartments for rent and \nthen used Facebook’s Boost feature to target one ad each to four major markets in different \nregions of the country.  Using the Facebook Pre-Populated List and Boost’s “inclusion” feature, \nNFHA selected the preset interest inclusion option of “no kids” and the present demographic \ninclusion option of “men” to target for the ad.  Using the “exclusions” feature within Boost for \neach ad,  NFHA selected the demographic preset options of “corporate moms,” “stay-at-home \nmoms,” “moms of grade school kids,” “moms of high school kids,” “fit moms,” “green moms,”  \n“big-city moms,” “trendy moms,” “soccer moms,” “moms of preschool kids,” “parents with \ntoddlers (01-02),” “parents with preschoolers (03-05),” “parents with early school-age children \n(06-08),” “parents with teenagers (13-18),” and “parents with preteens (08-12)” to exclude \nfamilies with young children and mothers from each Boost’s potential audience.  Facebook \nestimated that these four Boosts would reach a total of 463,000 people.\n84. Having determined that Facebook had likely developed the same discriminatory \ncontent in other major housing markets, NFHA contacted three of its member groups; FHJC, \nHOPE, and FHCGSA.  NFHA provided these groups with training on how to use the Facebook \nadvertising features and conduct a similar investigation.  These groups investigated on their own \nand jointly with NFHA to assess Facebook’s discriminatory practices in their home markets.  \n21\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689   Document 1   Filed 03/27/18   Page 22 of 52\n2. Facebook’s Discrimination in the New York, New York Housing \nMarket\na. Boost Investigation\n85. On January 30, 2018, NFHA created an ad for a fictitious apartment for rent and \nthen used Facebook’s Boost feature to target the ad to the New York City, New York market.  \nUsing the Facebook Pre-Populated List and Boost’s “inclusion” and “exclusion” features, NFHA \nselected combinations of (1) the preset interest inclusion option of “no kids” and the present \ndemographic inclusion option of “men” to target for the ad, and (2) the preset demographic \nexclusion options of “moms of grade school kids,” “moms of high school kids,” “moms of \npreschool kids” and “stay-at-home moms,” “parents with toddlers (01-02 years),” “parents with \npreschoolers (03-05 years),” “parents with early school-age children (06-08 years),” “parents \nwith teenagers (13-18 years),” and “parents with preteens (08-12 years) to exclude families with \nchildren and mothers from the Boost’s potential audience.  Facebook estimated that this Boost \nwould reach 280,000 people.   \n86. On February 13, 2018, FHJC created an ad for a fictitious apartment for rent and \nthen used Facebook’s Boost feature to target the ad to the New York City, New York market and \nits surrounding areas within ten miles.  Using the Facebook Pre-Populated List and the \n“exclusions” feature within Boost, FHJC selected the preset demographic options of  “parents \nwith toddlers (01-02 years),” “parents with preschoolers (03-05 years),” “parents with early \nschool-age children (06-08 years),” “parents with teenagers (13-18 years), and “parents with \npreteens (08-12 years)” to exclude families with young children from the Boost’s potential \naudience.  NFHA also used the Facebook Pre-Populated List and the “inclusion” feature within \nBoost to select the preset demographic option of “men,” and thereby exclude women from the \nBoost’s potential audience.  Facebook estimated that the Boost would reach 95,000 people.   \n22\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689   Document 1   Filed 03/27/18   Page 23 of 52\n87. On February 13, 2018, FHJC created an ad for a fictitious apartment for rent and \nthen used Facebook’s Boost feature to target the ad to the New York City, New York market and \nits surrounding areas within ten miles.  Using the Facebook Pre-Populated List “inclusion” \nfeature within Boost, FHJC selected the preset demographic option of “men”, thereby excluding \nwomen from the Boosts’ potential audience.  Facebook estimated that the Boost would reach \n44,000 people.\nb. Ad Manager Investigation\n88. In February 2018, NFHA created two ads for fictitious apartments for rent, and \nselected New York City, New York as the market for the ads to run in.

On February 12, 2018, NFHA created an ad for a fictitious apartment for rent and \nthen used Facebook’s Boost feature to target the ad to the San Antonio, Texas market.  Using the \nFacebook Pre-Populated List and the “exclusions” feature within Boost, NFHA selected the \npreset demographic options of “parents with toddlers (01-02 years),” “parents with preschoolers \n(03-05 years),” “parents with early school-age children (06-08 years),” “parents with teenagers \n(13-18 years),” and “parents with preteens (08-12 years)” to exclude families with young \nchildren from the Boost’s potential audience.

On February 23, 2018, FHCGSA created three ads using Facebook Ad Manager \nfor fictitious apartments for rent.  FHCGSA selected San Antonio, Texas and its surrounding \nareas within ten miles as the market for the ad to run in.  Using the Facebook Pre-Populated List \nand the “exclusions” feature within Ad Manager, FHCGSA selected combinations of the preset \noptions of “corporate moms,” “stay-at-home moms,” “moms of grade school kids,” “moms of \nhigh school kids,” “fit moms,” “green moms,”  “big-city moms,” “trendy moms,” “soccer \nmoms,” “moms of preschool kids,” “parents with toddlers (01-02 years),” “parents with \npreschoolers (03-05 years),” “parents with early school-age children (06-08 years),” “parents \nwith teenagers (13-18 years),” and “parents with preteens (08-12 years)”  to exclude mothers and \nfamilies with young children from the ad’s potential audience.

Facebook estimated that the ads would reach 340,000, and 440,000 people \nrespectively.\nD. Common Allegations Regarding the Results of Plaintiffs’ Investigation into \nFacebook’s Discriminatory Housing Advertising   \n101. Facebook approved all of the Boosts and ads described above in paragraphs 75-\n100 in anywhere from one minute to approximately one hour.   \n102. After Facebook approved them, all of the Boosts and ads described above in \nparagraphs 75-100 were removed from Facebook by the respective Plaintiff that created them. \n103. Facebook’s Advertising Policies do not comply with the Fair Housing Act or with \nstate and local fair housing laws, including in New York.\n104. Under the caption “Discriminatory Practices,” Facebook states: “Ads must not \ndiscriminate or encourage discrimination against people based on personal attributes such as \nrace, ethnicity, color, national origin, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, \nfamily status, disability, medical or genetic condition.”18\n105. This policy misleads Facebook users because, for example, it does not state that \nthere are additional categories of prohibited discrimination in state and local fair housing laws \nsuch as marital status, military status, status as a survivor of domestic violence, lawful source of \nincome, including rental subsidies, and others. \n106. The policy further misstates the obligations imposed by the FHA because, among \nother things, it does not explain that indicating a preference or limitation based on a protected \n18\nhttps://www.facebook.com/policies/ads/prohibited_content/discriminatory_practices# (last visited March 27, \n2018).\n29\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689   Document 1   Filed 03/27/18   Page 30 of 52\ncharacteristic constitutes illegal discrimination and that advertisements that deny particular \nsegments of the housing market information about housing opportunities violate the FHA. \n107. Although Facebook stopped approving housing advertisements that used  its \n“ethnic affinity” option in late 2017, it continues to create and develop content that facilitates \nadvertisers excluding certain audiences based on legally protected characteristics.   \n108. Facebook develops and provides the Facebook Pre-Populated List that enables \nlandlords and real estate agents to exclude people from receiving housing advertisements based \non family status and sex.    \n109. Between December 14, 2017 and February 23, 2018, Facebook accepted for \npublication forty advertisements from Plaintiffs that excluded potential home seekers on the \nbasis of family status and/or sex.\n110. Facebook provides “interests” categories for housing advertisements that permit a \nlandlord or real estate firm to exclude users based on disability-related factors (for example, by \nchecking the pre-populated category of “Interest in Disabled Parking Permit”) and national \norigin (for example, “Interest in Telemundo”). \n111. These categories deny information about housing opportunities to persons with \ndisabilities, persons living with or associating with persons with disabilities, and/or persons who \nare Hispanic or speak Spanish and are more likely to be Hispanic.  These “interest” categories \nare the equivalent of demographic exclusion categories labeled “disability” or “Hispanic.”  There \nis no lawful reason for Facebook to create this content that enables advertisers to exclude \npotential audience members for housing ads on these bases.   \n112. As recently as March 23, 2018, NFHA attempted to “edit” an ad that it created in \nNovember 2016 that excluded potential audience members only on the basis of race and national \n30\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689   Document 1   Filed 03/27/18   Page 31 of 52\norigin.  NFHA received a message from Facebook stating that “some of the detailed targeting \nselections you originally used in your Saved Audience are no longer available.  They won’t show \nup in this audience targeting, but the associated ads will still deliver to the original \naudience.  However, you’ll be unable to use these detailed targeting selections if you edit this \naudience or try running future ads with it” (emphasis added).  \n113. Based on this message, it appears that even though Facebook removed \ndiscriminatory demographic selections that allowed advertisers to exclude on the basis of race \nand national origin from the Facebook Pre-Populated List, it still allows previously existing ads \nthat excluded or targeted on these bases to continue to do so. \n114. By creating the Facebook Pre-Populated List, Facebook materially contributes to \nongoing violations of the Fair Housing Act made through its advertising platform.  \n115. Plaintiffs’ investigation demonstrates that despite notice from NFHA and other \ncivil rights groups as early as 2016 of its clear violations of the federal Fair Housing Act, \nFacebook has continued to engage in discriminatory housing advertising practices.   \n116. Facebook has acted intentionally, willfully, and with reckless disregard of existing \nfederal and local fair housing rights.\nVI. HARM TO PLAINTIFFS CAUSED BY FACEBOOK THROUGH DIVERSION \nOF RESOURCES AND FRUSTRATION OF MISSION \n117. Facebook’s discriminatory and unlawful practices have frustrated and continue to \nfrustrate each Plaintiff’s mission of ensuring that all people have equal access to housing \nopportunities and promoting residential integration across the country, as well as in the New \nYork City, Washington, D.C., Miami, and San Antonio metropolitan areas. \n118. In an effort to address and to counteract the effects of Defendant’s discriminatory \nconduct, prior to the filing of this action, each of the Plaintiffs has diverted resources and staff \n31\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689   Document 1   Filed 03/27/18   Page 32 of 52\nfrom other activities to investigate and document Defendant’s policies and practices.  Each \nPlaintiff also engaged in public education efforts, prior to this filing, to raise awareness of \ndiscriminatory housing advertising practices in the communities each Plaintiff serves. \n119. Prior to the filing of this Complaint, NFHA diverted and expended financial \nresources and staff time to, among other things, design and implement the investigation, \nincluding time to train and work with other Plaintiffs on their investigations; review and analyze \nthe investigative results; and conduct legal research and seek legal advice from attorneys.    \n120. FHJC, HOPE, and FHCGSA each expended staff time and other resources to \ninvestigate Defendant’s advertising practices, which diverted staff and resources away from \nother organizational activities, prior to the filing of this Complaint.  Among other things, FHJC, \nHOPE, and FHCGSA spent time being trained by NFHA to use Facebook’s advertising platform, \ncreate a non-existent realty firm, and design and document their efforts to create and place \nhousing advertisements on Facebook. \n121. If Facebook had complied with the requirements of the FHA after being informed \nof them by NFHA, then Plaintiffs would not have devoted considerable staff time and resources \nto identify the nature and scope of Facebook’s advertising policies and practices.\n122. Each Plaintiff’s mission is frustrated when Facebook excludes members of the \npublic from access to housing advertising and information about housing opportunities based on \ntheir sex, familial status, disability, race, national origin, or other protected characteristics. \n123. Because Facebook’s discriminatory advertising practices alleged in this \nComplaint violate federal, state, and local fair housing laws they undermine rather than advance \nequal housing opportunity and perpetuate the harms of residential segregation.   \n32\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689   Document 1   Filed 03/27/18   Page 33 of 52\n124. To address and attempt to counteract the effects of Facebook’s discriminatory \nconduct, prior to the filing of this action, each Plaintiff has engaged in public education \ncampaigns to raise public awareness of the problem of discriminatory housing advertising and to \neducate housing providers about their legal obligations under fair housing laws not to advertise \nhousing for rent or sale in a discriminatory manner. \n125. In early 2018, NFHA drafted guidelines for housing advertisers that it posted on \nits website in English and Spanish with a link to specific information about each state’s fair \nhousing laws, a copy of the HUD fair housing logo for advertisers to use, previously produced \npublic service announcements, and a recorded webinar on discriminatory advertising held by \nNFHA in April 2017. \n126. In early 2018, each Plaintiff expended staff time to develop education campaigns \nand design advertisements for social media aimed to reach housing providers who place ads and \nconsumers searching for housing in the Washington D.C., New York City, Miami, and San \nAntonio metropolitan regions.  Plaintiffs posted these ads on Facebook and Twitter on an \nongoing basis, including translating ads into Spanish. \n127. During this same time period, each Plaintiff expended staff time to communicate \nand coordinate with each other about their individual education campaigns to ensure Plaintiffs \nwere providing a consistent message reaching both housing providers and consumers in each \nmetropolitan area.  Each Plaintiff also has expended staff time prior to filing this Complaint to \nbegin to design workshops, a webinar, consumer flyers, and/or fact sheets.  Finally, NFHA has \nbegun to contact on-line education providers who offer courses on using social media for \nadvertising to request that they distribute information about housing advertising guidelines and \nbest practices that comply with fair housing laws. \n33\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689   Document 1   Filed 03/27/18   Page 34 of 52\n128. As a direct and proximate result of Facebook’s discriminatory practices described \nabove, each Plaintiff has suffered and will continue to suffer a diversion of its resources and a \nfrustration of its mission. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a),(c),(f): Familial Status, Sex, Disability, Race, and \nNational Origin Discrimination) \n129. Plaintiffs restate and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs above as \nif fully set forth herein. \n130. The housing advertised for rent or sale on Facebook using the platform described \nabove are “dwellings” as defined by the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3602(b). \n131.

New York City Administrative Code § 8-107(6) declares that it “shall be an \nunlawful discriminatory practice for any person to aid, abet, incite, compel or coerce the doing of \nany of the acts forbidden under this chapter.” \n135. The housing advertised for rent or sale on Facebook using the platform described \nabove are “housing accommodations” as defined by the New York City Human Rights Law, § 8-\n102(10).\n136. Facebook’s creation of preset categories on its advertising platform that facilitate \nunlawful discrimination in housing advertisements constitutes aiding, abetting, inciting and \ncompelling the doing of acts forbidden under Section 8-107(5)(3) of the New York City \nAdministrative Code, including the “declar[ing], print[ing] or circulat[ing] or caus[ing] to be \ndeclared, printed or circulated any statement, advertisement or publication . . . which expresses, \ndirectly or indirectly, any limitation, specification or discrimination as to race, creed, color, \nnational origin, gender, age, disability, sexual orientation, marital status, partnership status, or \nalienage or citizenship status, or any lawful source of income, or whether children are, may be, \nor would be residing with a person, or any intent to make such limitation, specification or \ndiscrimination” (emphasis added).  \n35\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689   Document 1   Filed 03/27/18   Page 36 of 52\n137. Facebook’s creation of preset categories on its platform that enable unlawful \ndiscrimination in housing advertisements violated, and continues to violate, Section 8-107(5)(e) \nby denying persons access to Facebook’s real estate advertisements on the basis of familial status \nand gender. \n138.

This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act (“FHA”), a statute \nintended to end discrimination in housing markets throughout the United States.  For decades, \nthe FHA has prohibited both publishers and advertisers from “targeting” ads based on sex, \nfamily status, disability, national origin, and other protected characteristics.\n2. Given this milestone, it is all the more egregious and shocking that Defendant \nFacebook continues to create content for landlords and real estate brokers to bar families with \nchildren, women, and others from receiving rental and sales ads for housing.  Facebook has \nengaged in discrimination by design—stripping data from its users and using it to create \ndiscriminatory advertising content: a pre-populated list of demographics, behaviors, and interests \nfrom which housing advertisers select in order to exclude certain home seekers from ever seeing \ntheir ads.  \n3. Housing advertising has of course changed in the last fifty years, moving beyond \nbillboards, “for rent” signs, and classifieds in the newspaper, to online advertising.  Facebook’s \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689-JGK   Document 33   Filed 06/25/18   Page 2 of 58\nability to customize an online audience for advertisements based on its vast trove of user data has \nmade it the biggest advertising agency in the world—the platform of choice for millions of \nbusinesses.  But Facebook has abused its enormous power. \n4. Over the past months, Plaintiffs, four nonprofit organizations with the common \nmission of eliminating housing discrimination and promoting residential integration, investigated \nFacebook’s conduct.  Plaintiffs created dozens of housing advertisements and completed \nFacebook’s full ad submission and review process.  Plaintiffs’ investigations in New York, \nWashington, D.C., Miami, and San Antonio confirm that Facebook first provides the option for \nadvertisers to exclude families with children and women from receiving advertisements, as well \nas users with interests based on disability and national origin.  Then Facebook approves the ads \nand permits advertisers to publish these ads in a discriminatory manner without consumers ever \nknowing they have been excluded.\n5. Discriminatory advertising is just as damaging as discrimination at the point of \nrental or sale.  If women with school-age children are categorically excluded from the Facebook \nadvertising audience for a rental apartment in a community with high-performing schools and \nother amenities, they are effectively denied access to that housing opportunity.  Facebook and its \nadvertisers have made the ad invisible to them.  At the same time, Facebook’s ad platform can \nfurther landlords’ illegal efforts to maintain a segregated, adults-only rental complex.  Whereas \nin the past, the excluded group might see the “for rent” sign or newspaper classified ad because \nthe ads were located in a public forum, the stealth nature of Facebook’s technology hides \nhousing ads from entire groups of people.  Facebook’s algorithms can ensure exclusion and deny \naccess to housing.  Facebook’s ability to target groups and promote discrimination so precisely \nwill surely only improve as the company continues to refine its technology.  \n2\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689-JGK   Document 33   Filed 06/25/18   Page 3 of 58\n6. Even before Plaintiffs conducted their most recent investigations, Facebook was \non notice for more than a year—from Plaintiffs and media reports (including by ProPublica)—\nthat its advertising platform violated fair housing laws.\n7. As Facebook significantly increases its presence in housing advertising and the \nhousing marketplace,1 it must first end its discriminatory advertising practices. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n8. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, as \nPlaintiffs assert federal claims under the FHA; under 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(4) as Plaintiffs seek to \nsecure equitable and other relief under federal civil rights laws; and under \n42 U.S.C. § 3613(a)(1)(A) as Plaintiffs seek appropriate relief regarding a discriminatory \nhousing practice under the FHA. \n9. The Court has supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ local law claims under \nthe New York City Human Rights Law pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a), as these claims are so \nrelated to their federal claims in this action that they form part of the same case or controversy. \n10. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Facebook pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. \n4(k)(1) and New York Civil Practice Law and Rules § 302(a)(1) because Facebook transacts \nbusiness within the state, § 302(a)(2) because Facebook has committed tortious and \ndiscriminatory acts within the state, § 302(a)(3)(i) because Facebook has committed a tortious \nand discriminatory act without the state causing injury to persons within the state, and regularly \ndoes business in the state, § 302(a)(3)(ii) because Facebook has committed a tortious and \ndiscriminatory act without the state causing injury to persons within the state, and derives \nsubstantial revenue from interstate commerce, and § 302(a)(4). \n1 Ben Lane, Facebook Launches Massive Push Into Real Estate Listings, Housingwire.com (Nov. 13, 2017), \nhttps://www.housingwire.com/articles/41797-facebook-launches-massive-push-into-real-estate-listings. \n3\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689-JGK   Document 33   Filed 06/25/18   Page 4 of 58\n11. Declaratory and injunctive relief is sought and authorized by 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 \nand 2202. \n12. Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1), as Defendant \nFacebook resides in this District in which it is subject to the Court’s personal jurisdiction, and \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) in that a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise \nto Plaintiffs’ claims occurred in this District. \nA. Facebook’s Contacts with New York  \n13. Facebook maintains a corporate office in this District located at 335 Madison \nAvenue, New York, New York 10017. \n14. Facebook is registered with the New York State Division of Corporations and \nassigned DOS ID #3842367l, with an appointed agent for service located at 80 State Street, \nAlbany, New York 12207. \n15. Upon information and belief, Facebook employs approximately 1,000 people. \n16. Facebook opened its New York office in 2012, stating that the New York office \n“won’t just be a satellite office, it will be a core part of our engineering staff.”2\n17. Facebook conducts advertising, engineering, and other activities in this District. \n18. According to Facebook, “Almost all of our big teams are centered around \nproducts that specifically benefit from being in New York . . . either teams working closely with \nlocal industries, products that address the experience of an urban environment, or center around \ntalent that is abundant on the east coast (like AI Research or Mobile Engineering).”3\n2 Jason Kincaid, Facebook To Open Engineering Office in NYC, techcrunch.com (Dec. 2, 2011), \nhttps://techcrunch.com/2011/12/02/facebook-to-open-engineering-office-in-nyc.\n3Director of Engineering at Facebook AI Explains the Advantages of New York Tech, Huffington Post.com (Jan. 22, \n2016), https://www.huffingtonpost.com/quora/director-of-engineering-a_b_9052764.html (emphasis supplied). \n4\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689-JGK   Document 33   Filed 06/25/18   Page 5 of 58\n19. As the largest city in the United States, New York City—with a total of more than \n3 million households according to the 2010 United States Census—is also the largest housing \nmarket in the country.4  As of 2011, New York City had a total of 3.35 million housing units, of \nwhich 65% were rental units, 30% were owner units, and 5% were vacant but not available for \nsale or rent.  The vacancy rate in 2011 for rental units in New York City was only 3.12%.  Half \nof the City’s housing units were in buildings of 20 or more units as of 2011.   \n20. The New York City housing market is unique in that, unlike other cities in the \nUnited States where landlords handle advertising and renting apartments directly, many \nlandlords use real estate agents to advertise apartments for rent and locate prospective renters.  \nAs of 2013, Manhattan alone had 27,000 licensed real estate brokers and sales persons working \nin both the sales and rental markets.5  These real estate brokers and agents use online real estate \nadvertising, including on Facebook.   \n21. For the New York City housing consumer, access to Facebook’s online real estate \nadvertising is crucial given the City’s low vacancy rate, high competition for dwelling units, and \nheavy reliance on real estate brokers and agents. \n22. Upon information and belief, Facebook receives a substantial amount of revenue \nfrom advertisements that are sold to New York-area companies or target New York residents, \nincluding an estimated reach of millions of people within the District. \n23. Upon information and belief, a portion of this substantial revenue comes from \nhousing advertisements that are sold to landlords and real estate brokers in the New York-area \nand target New York residents.  \n4 New York City Consolidated Plan, 2015-2-19 Needs Assessment & Market Analysis, December 16, 2016, NA-1. \n5 Leigh Kamping-Carder, Ranks of Manhattan brokers swell, as market strengthens, The Real Deal (Dec. 10, 2012), \nhttps://therealdeal.com/2012/12/10/ranks-of-new-york-city-brokers-swell-as-market-strengthens/.  \n5\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689-JGK   Document 33   Filed 06/25/18   Page 6 of 58\nTHE PARTIES \n24.

As of March 2017, Facebook had approximately 4 million advertisers using its \nplatform.  Many of these advertisers are real estate brokers, residential property owners, and real \nestate management companies offering housing for rent or for sale.7\nLEGAL BACKGROUND: DISCRIMINATORY ADVERTISING \n34. The Fair Housing Act states that it shall be unlawful “[t]o make, print, or publish, \nor cause to be made, printed, or published any notice, statement, or advertisement, with respect \nto the sale or rental of a dwelling that indicates any preference, limitation, or discrimination \nbased on race, color, religion, sex, handicap,8 familial status, or national origin, or an intention to \nmake any such preference, limitation, or discrimination.”  42 U.S.C. § 3604(c). \n35. Under its implementing regulations, the FHA provides that:\n(c) Discriminatory notices, statements and advertisements include, \nbut  are  not  limited  to:  (1) Using  words,  phrases,  photographs, \nillustrations, symbols or forms which convey that dwellings are \navailable or not available to a particular group of persons because \nof race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national \norigin . . . . (3) Selecting media or locations for advertising the sale \nor  rental  of  dwellings  which  deny  particular  segments  of  the \nhousing market information about housing opportunities because \nof race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national \norigin. (4) Refusing to publish advertising for the sale or rental of \ndwellings  .  .  .  because  of  race,  color,  religion,  sex,  handicap, \nfamilial status, or national origin.  \n 24 C.F.R. § 100.75. \n36. The Fair Housing Act further makes it unlawful “[t]o represent to any person \nbecause of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin that any \ndwelling is not available for inspection, sale, or rental when such dwelling is in fact so \navailable.”  42 U.S.C. § 3604(d).   \n7See Facebook Marketplace to Post Apartment List Rental Homes, naahq.org (Nov. 9, 2017), \nhttps://www.naahq.org/news-publications/facebook-marketplace-post-apartmentlist-rental-homes .  \n8 Hereinafter, the term “disability” shall be used for the term “handicap” unless quoting from the statutory text.  \n9\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689-JGK   Document 33   Filed 06/25/18   Page 10 of 58\n37. The Fair Housing Act’s advertising prohibitions apply to “all written or oral \nnotices or statements by a person engaged in the sale or rental of a dwelling” which include “any \napplications, flyers, brochures, deeds, signs, banners, posters, billboards, or any documents used \nwith respect to the sale or rental of a dwelling.”  24 C.F.R. § 100.75(b). \n38. In the advertising context, these prohibitions apply to both the person who drafted \nor placed the ad as well as the publisher of the ad because the negative effect of discriminatory \nadvertising would be magnified if widely circulated by newspapers and other mass media.  See\nUnited States v. Hunter, 459 F.2d 205, 215 (4th Cir. 1972).  Under the FHA, illegal advertising \npractices not only discourage or prevent buyers and renters from accessing information about \nhousing opportunities, but also create an impression that housing segregation is legal, thus \nfacilitating future discrimination by others.  SeeSpann v. Colonial Village, Inc., 899 F.2d 24, 29 \n(D.C. Cir. 1990).\n39. It is black-letter law that publishing advertisements that indicate discriminatory \npreferences or limit the information available on the basis of discriminatory preferences is \nillegal. SeeRagin v. New York Times, 923 F.2d 995 (2d Cir. 1991); 24 C.F.R. § 100.80(b)(4) \n(explaining that § 3604(d) prohibits “[l]imiting information, by word or conduct, regarding \nsuitably priced dwellings available for inspection, sale or rental, because of race, color, religion, \nsex, handicap, familial status, or national origin”). \n40. The continuing presence of discriminatory advertising practices serves to \nencourage both the housing provider and the home seeker to believe housing discrimination is \n“an accepted norm despite the FHA’s pronouncements to the contrary.”  Robert Schwemm, \nDiscriminatory Housing Statements and § 3604(c): A New Look at the Fair Housing Act’s Most \nIntriguing Provision, 29 Fordham Urb.

Lastly, the FHA provides that “it shall be unlawful to deny any person access to \nor membership or participation in any multiple-listing service, real estate brokers’ organization \nor other service, organization, or facility relating to the business of selling or renting dwellings,\nor to discriminate against him in the terms or conditions of such access, membership, or \nparticipation, on account of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national \norigin.”  42 U.S.C. § 3606 (emphasis added).  \n42. This prohibition applies to multiple-listing services, real estate organizations, \nrental listing services, and other entities in the business of providing services and/or information \nrelated to selling or renting housing.  See United States v. Space Hunters, Inc., No. 00-CIV-1781, \n2001 WL 968993, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 24, 2001), aff’d in relevant part,United States v. Space \nHunters, Inc., 429 F.3d 416, 421 (2d Cir. 2005). \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA. Facebook’s Powerful and Far-Reaching Advertising Platform  \n43. Facebook generated over $40 billion in revenue last year, almost all of which was \nmade through selling advertisements on its website.\n44. Facebook’s platform provides advertisers with “a number of different ways to \nengage with people on Facebook, the most important of which is the News Feed which displays \nan algorithmically-ranked series of stories and advertisements individualized for each person.”9\n45. As Facebook promotes itself to its prospective advertisers, its greatest advertising \nasset is its user base of over 2 billion people.10  This user base includes not only Facebook users, \n9 Facebook Investor Relations, https://investor.fb.com/financials/sec-filings-details/default.aspx?FilingId=12512043 \n(Facebook, Inc. Annual Report for the Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2017).   \n10 Facebook Business, Facebook Ads, https://www.facebook.com/business/products/ads (last visited March 21, \n2018). \n11\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689-JGK   Document 33   Filed 06/25/18   Page 12 of 58\nbut also users of other applications owned by Facebook, including Instagram.  Facebook collects \na remarkable amount of information about each one of these users.  \n46. Although Facebook users often voluntarily provide limited personal information, \nsuch as their age, gender, employer, and limited other categories, most of the data Facebook \ncollects is not self-reported.11\n47. The vast majority of this information comes from Facebook’s collection, \nevaluation, and processing of their users’ behavior both on and off Facebook to learn about \nusers’ demographics (for example, their family status), their interests (for example, their political \nleanings or hobbies), and their behaviors (for example that they are “recent mortgage borrowers” \nor that their “spending method” is “primarily cash”).12\n48. Users are given no choice but to provide this data when they register for a \nFacebook account, as allowing Facebook to “process” this information about its users is a \nmandatory condition of using the Facebook site.13\n49. The end result has been described as “arguably the most complete consumer \nprofile on earth,”14 as it reflects each Facebook user’s demographics, location, interests, and \nonline behaviors.\n11 Upturn, Leveling the Platform: Real Transparency for the Paid Messages on Facebook, at 8 (May 2018), \navailable at https://www.teamupturn.org/static/reports/2018/facebook-ads/files/Upturn-Facebook-Ads-2018-05-\n08.pdf. \n12Id.\n13 Facebook, Data Policy, https://www.facebook.com/full_data_use_policy (last visited June 25, 2018). \n14 Caitlin Dewey, 98 personal data points that Facebook uses to target ads to you, Wash. Post (Aug. 19, 2016), \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/08/19/98-personal-data-points-that-facebook-uses-to-\ntarget-ads-to-you/?utm_term=.58ce94764ccf.  \n12\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689-JGK   Document 33   Filed 06/25/18   Page 13 of 58\n50. Facebook then employs algorithms to analyze, sort, and repurpose this treasure \ntrove of information so that advertisers can “target the people who are right for [their] \nbusiness.”15\n51. These algorithms automatically designate each Facebook user as falling into the \nvarious categories it has determined fit that user’s demographics, interests, and behaviors. \n52. Facebook users’ personal information regarding demographics, interests, and \nbehaviors does not just passively flow untouched from the users to advertisers.  Rather, \nFacebook extracts data from its users’ online behavior, both on Facebook and off, and uses \nalgorithms designed to sort that data, process it, and repackage it to group potential customers \ninto new and salient categories for advertisers to choose from when targeting their ads.\n53. These data-analyzing algorithms and the resulting Facebook-created content \nempower advertisers to seek out potential audiences with incredible specificity.  Advertisers can \ntarget users based on information as general as geographic location, or as specific as their \nbirthday or preferred methods of payment.  Advertisers would not be able to engage in this \ntargeted advertising without the categories and content that Facebook creates and develops.\n1. Facebook’s Use of “Include” and “Exclude” Options \n54. Facebook has designed its advertising platform so that advertisers can “target” \ntheir audience using two general actions—“including” specific types of people and “excluding” \nspecific types of people. \n55.  Once Facebook has analyzed the immense amount of personal data it collects and \nhas used it to classify potential customers by categories based on their perceived demographics, \ninterests, and behaviors, Facebook then provides its advertisers with a pre-populated list of these \n15 Facebook Business, Choose Your Audience,  https://www.facebook.com/business/products/ads/ad-targeting (last \nvisited March 21, 2018). \n13\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689-JGK   Document 33   Filed 06/25/18   Page 14 of 58\ndemographics, interests, and behaviors (the “Facebook Pre-Populated List”).  As explained \nabove, only a handful of categories (age, gender, location, language, university, field of study, \nemployer, and any “liked” pages) are self-reported by users.  The majority of these hundreds of \ncategories are new categories that Facebook’s algorithms create after Facebook sorts and \nanalyzes each Facebook user’s online activity.\n56. Advertisers then scroll through this Facebook-created content and select which \ncharacteristics they would like to “include” and which they would like “exclude” from the ad’s \naudience.\n57. For example, when an advertiser checks the pre-populated box to “include” the \nFacebook-created demographic category of parents with toddlers (01-02), parents with toddlers \n(01-02) become the target audience for the ad and, through Facebook’s algorithms arranging the \nad delivery process, only parents with toddlers will receive the ad on their Facebook pages or in \ntheir News Feeds.  Non-parents will not receive the ad. \n58. When an advertiser “excludes” a specific demographic, behavior, or interest, no \nperson who reflects that quality will receive the ad.  If an advertiser checks the pre-populated \nbox to exclude the Facebook-created interest category of people who have an interest in cooking, \nFacebook’s algorithms similarly ensure that no one with that interest will receive the \nadvertisement on their Facebook page or in their News Feed.  \n59. These features can also be used simultaneously.  For example, if an advertiser \n“includes” parents with toddlers but also “excludes” people with an interest in cooking, the ad \nwill only appear on the Facebook pages or in the News Feeds of parents with toddlers who do \nnot have an interest in cooking.  Facebook’s algorithms prevent non-parents, or parents with non-\ntoddler children, (who are excluded because they were not “included” in the “target” audience) \n14\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689-JGK   Document 33   Filed 06/25/18   Page 15 of 58\nand people with an interest in cooking (who were “excluded” even if they otherwise would be in \nthe target audience) from receiving the ad. \n60. Facebook creates, in whole or in part, almost all of the information provided to \nadvertisers to “include” or “exclude” certain persons. \n61. As advertisers add and subtract groups from their potential audience, Facebook \nprovides them with real-time estimates of how many people can view their advertisements.  A \nscreenshot of how this appears on Facebook’s platform is attached hereto as Exhibit A. \n62. Facebook has placed these features on at least two different advertising \nplatforms—by “boosting” posts and through Facebook Ad Manager.\n63. Facebook has also created algorithms to provide “lookalike” audiences to \nadvertisers.  Under this feature, advertisers provide Facebook custom audiences they believe are \ngood for their business, and Facebook employs its own algorithms to create new audiences that \nresemble that custom audience.  As Facebook itself explains, “[a] Lookalike Audience is a way \nto reach new people who are likely to be interested in your business because they’re similar to \nyour best existing customers.”16  After the advertiser provides Facebook with its custom \naudience, Facebook will “hash [its] data, upload it and create the [new] audience.”17  In creating \nthese new “Lookalike Audiences” Facebook’s algorithms consider protected characteristics such \nas sex, familial status, disability, race, and national origin.18\n16 Facebook Business, Advertising Help Center, https://www.facebook.com/business/help/164749007013531 (last \nvisited June 25, 2018).  \n17 Facebook Business, Advertising Help Center, https://www.facebook.com/business/help/170456843145568 (last \nvisited June 25, 2018).  \n18 Upturn, Leveling the Platform: Real Transparency for the Paid Messages on Facebook, at 9 (May 2018), \navailable at https://www.teamupturn.org/static/reports/2018/facebook-ads/files/Upturn-Facebook-Ads-2018-05-\n08.pdf.  \n15\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689-JGK   Document 33   Filed 06/25/18   Page 16 of 58\n2. Facebook’s Use of “Boosts” \n64. In order to “boost” a post, a business will first create a post to be published on its \nFacebook page.  This could be information about the business, a new promotion—anything that \nthe business would like to share with its customers.   \n65. The advertiser may then pay to “boost” that post by having it appear as an \nadvertisement on the Facebook pages or in the News Feeds of various other Facebook users.   \n66. To select which Facebook users receive that “boosted” advertisement, the \nbusiness may use the same “inclusion” and “exclusion” features described above.\n67. While any Facebook user may view the ad on the business’s Facebook page, only \nusers in the audience selected by the advertiser will receive a “boosted” advertisement on their \nown Facebook pages or in their news feeds.   \n68. For example, a restaurant may post about a new addition to its menu on its \nFacebook page.  It could then “boost” that post to an “included” or “targeted” audience—i.e., \npersons who live within 10 miles of the restaurant and have an interest in Italian food—both \ncategories in the Facebook Pre-Populated List.  In this circumstance, any Facebook user could \nview the post by navigating to the restaurant’s Facebook page, but only those in the targeted \naudience would receive the advertisement on their own pages or in their News Feeds.  \n3. Facebook “Ad Manager” \n69. Facebook also offers its advertisers the option to use Facebook Ad Manager.  \nUsing Ad Manager, an advertiser can customize exactly who will receive its advertisement, as \nwell as various other features such as where and how frequently the ad appears on the Facebook \naccounts of its targeted audience.  In this circumstance, only the audience selected using the \n“inclusion” and “exclusion” features above will be able to view the ad.  \n16\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689-JGK   Document 33   Filed 06/25/18   Page 17 of 58\n70. For example, a restaurant could create an advertisement using Ad Manager for a \nnew menu item and then select its audience using the “inclusion” and “exclusion” features—i.e., \n“include” persons who live within ten miles of the restaurant and/or have an interest in Italian \nfood but “exclude” persons with an interest in cooking.  In this circumstance only persons who \nlive within ten miles of the restaurant or have an interest in Italian food, but do not have an \ninterest in cooking, will be able to view the post.  \nB. ProPublica Reveals Facebook’s Discriminatory Housing Advertising \nPlatform \n71. On October 28, 2016, the investigative news nonprofit ProPublica published an \narticle reporting that Facebook’s online platform enabled advertisers to exclude Facebook users \nassigned black, Hispanic and other “ethnic affinities” from seeing advertisements in the housing \ncategory through its advertising portal.19\n72. In response to ProPublica’s article, NFHA investigated Facebook’s practices. \n73. On November 3, 2016, an NFHA employee using a personal Facebook account \ncreated an advertisement using Facebook Ad Manager.  The ad was for a fictitious apartment for \nrent and the employee selected for it to be advertised across the United States.  Using the \n“exclusions” feature within Ad Manager, the employee selected the demographic preset options \nof “African-Americans” and “Hispanics” to exclude African-Americans and Hispanics from the \nad’s potential audience.  Facebook approved this ad.  The ad ran for three days.  A screenshot of \nthese demographic preset options is attached hereto as Exhibit B. \n74. On November 3, 2016, NFHA sent Facebook a letter stating that Facebook’s \nadvertising features appeared to violate the FHA and state laws, and that it was “illegal for an \n19 Julia Angwin and Terry Parris Jr., Facebook Lets Advertisers Exclude Users By Race, Propublica.org (Oct. 28, \n2016), https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-lets-advertisers-exclude-users-by-race.  \n17\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689-JGK   Document 33   Filed 06/25/18   Page 18 of 58\nonline advertiser to filter housing-related advertising in a discriminatory manner on the basis of \nrace, religion, national origin and other protected characteristics.” \n75. On November 7, 2016, Facebook’s representative responded to NFHA via email \nstating: “We think ethnic affinity marketing is really valuable in promoting diversity of the \nvoices and images on our platform, but we also understand the concerns we’re hearing about \nwrongful discrimination.  At this point, we’re listening to stakeholders like you and considering \nthe way forward.” \n76. On November 10, 2016, NFHA met with Facebook representatives with regard to \nthe discriminatory advertising platform.  NFHA explained to the Facebook representatives \npresent that the Fair Housing Act and civil rights laws prohibited any system which excluded \ncertain categories of people from viewing advertisements for housing, employment or credit.  \nNFHA requested that Facebook cease and remedy its discriminatory behavior. \n77. On November 11, 2016, NFHA sent Facebook citations to legal cases regarding \nits liability for its advertising platform. \n78. On November 11, 2016, Facebook posted a statement on its “Newsroom” titled \n“Improving Enforcement and Promoting Diversity: Updates to Ethnic Affinity Marketing,” in \nwhich it stated that it would “disable the use of ethnic affinity marketing for ads that we identify \nas offering housing, employment or credit.”20\n79. On February 8, 2017, Facebook published a statement on its website titled, \n“Improving Enforcement and Promoting Diversity: Updates to Ads Policies and Tools.”21\n20 Erin Egan, Improving Enforcement and Promoting Diversity: Updates to Ethnic Affinity Marketing,\nnewsroom.fb.com, (Nov. 11, 2016), https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/11/updates-to-ethnic-affinity-marketing/.  \n21Improving Enforcement and Promoting Diversity: Updates to Ads Policies and Tools, newsroom.fb.com (Feb. 8, \n2017), https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/02/improving-enforcement-and-promoting-diversity-updates-to-ads-\npolicies-and-tools/.  \n18\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689-JGK   Document 33   Filed 06/25/18   Page 19 of 58\nFacebook committed to end the use of “ethnic affinity marketing” for ads that it identified as \noffering housing, employment, or credit.  For ads that use Facebook’s other exclusion and \ninclusion categories, Facebook said it would require housing, employment, and credit advertisers \nto “self-certify” that their ads complied with anti-discrimination laws. \n80. In its self-certification feature, Facebook states that “when running an ad for an \napartment for rent, it may be illegal to exclude people who have children from that \nopportunity.”22\n81. On November 21, 2017, more than a year after its original report, ProPublica \npublished a second story revealing that Facebook had not followed through on its commitment to \nremedy its discriminatory conduct, and that Facebook continued to create content that enables \nhousing advertisers to exclude users by prohibited categories such as race and national origin.23\n82. ProPublica reported that it had bought dozens of rental housing ads on Facebook, \nbut asked that they not be shown to certain categories of users, such as African-Americans, \nmothers of high school kids, people interested in wheelchair ramps, Jews, expats from Argentina, \nand Spanish speakers.  Facebook had approved all of these ads.   \n83. Based on Facebook’s prior announcement that it would end the use of “ethnic \naffinity marketing” for housing opportunities, Facebook should have rejected the ads purchased \nby ProPublica that excluded viewers on the basis of race.  The other ads should have prompted a \nscreen to pop up asking for self-certification.  ProPublica reported that it never encountered a \nself-certification screen, and Facebook rejected none of its ads.\n22Id.\n23 Julia Angwin, Ariana Tobin, Madeleine Varner, Facebook (Still) Letting Housing Advertisers Exclude Users by \nRace, propublica.org (Nov. 21, 2017), https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-advertising-discrimination-\nhousing-race-sex-national-origin.  \n19\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689-JGK   Document 33   Filed 06/25/18   Page 20 of 58\nC. Plaintiffs’ Investigation Into Facebook’s Housing Advertising Platform \nConfirms Discriminatory Practices Continue \n84. In response to ProPublica’s November 21, 2017 report, NFHA commenced an \ninvestigation into Facebook’s advertising practices.\n85. On November 30, 2017, an NFHA employee using a personal Facebook account \ncreated a Facebook page for a non-existent real estate company entitled “Metro Boutique \nRentals.”  Through this page, NFHA staff viewed Facebook’s Ad Manager and Boost features. \n86. In summary, NFHA’s initial investigation into Facebook’s practices found as \nfollows: \na. The Facebook Pre-Populated List provided housing advertisers with the option of \nexcluding potential audience members from housing ads on the basis of demographic \ncategories that Facebook created based on its own analysis of users’ online activity, \nincluding race and national origin.\nb. At some point, Facebook eliminated the option from the Facebook Pre-Populated List \nfor housing advertisers to exclude potential audience members from housing \nopportunities on the basis of race and national origin.    \nc. The Facebook Pre-Populated List created the capability for housing advertisers to \nexclude people from seeing their ads on the basis of their family status in a variety of \nways.  It provided checkboxes of family-status related categories created by Facebook \nfrom analyzing and repurposing users’ data that housing advertisers could use to \nremove persons from their potential audience, such as parents with toddlers (01-02), \nparents with preschoolers (03-05), parents with early school-age children (06-08), \nmoms of grade school kids, and moms of high school kids.  A screenshot of how \n20\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689-JGK   Document 33   Filed 06/25/18   Page 21 of 58\nthese exclusions appear on Facebook’s Boost and Ad Manager features is attached \nhereto as Exhibit C.\nd. The Facebook Pre-Populated List created the capability for housing advertisers to \n“include” potential audience members based on an interest in “no kids.” \ne. The Facebook Pre-Populated List created content for housing advertisers to exclude \npeople from seeing their ads on the basis of sex.  It provided checkboxes that housing \nadvertisers could use to exclude either men or women from viewing their ads by \nchecking the box to “include” the other.  A screenshot of how these exclusions appear \non Facebook’s Boost and Ad Manager features is attached hereto as Exhibit D.\nf. The Facebook Pre-Populated List created content for housing advertisers to exclude \non the basis of interest categories created by Facebook and derived from Facebook’s \ndata analysis that are the equivalent of protected characteristics, such as: Interest in \nDisabled American Veteran, Interest in Disabled Parking Permit, Interest in \nDisability.gov, Interest in Telemundo, and Interest in English as a second language.  \nScreenshots of how these exclusions on Facebook’s Boost and Ad Manager features \nare attached hereto as Exhibit E. \ng. Facebook had created algorithms to provide “suggested” audiences to advertisers \nbased on the audiences selected in their prior ads.  Facebook’s “suggestions” included \ndemographic and interest categories that discriminate on the basis of protected \ncharacteristics such as sex, familial status, disability, race, or national origin. \n1. Facebook’s Discrimination in the Washington, D.C. Housing Market \na. Boost Investigation\n87. On January 2, 2018, an NFHA employee using a personal Facebook account \ncreated an ad for a fictitious apartment for rent and then used Facebook’s Boost feature to \n21\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689-JGK   Document 33   Filed 06/25/18   Page 22 of 58\npromote the ad in Washington, D.C.  Using the Facebook Pre-Populated List and the \n“exclusions” feature within Boost, the employee selected the preset options of those with \ninterests in the “National Association for Bikers with a Disability,” “Disabled American \nVeterans,” “Disability.gov,” and “Disabled Parking Permit” to exclude from the Boost’s \npotential audience.   Facebook estimated that the Boost would reach 1.2 million people.   \n88. On January 2, 2018, an NFHA employee using a personal Facebook account  \ncreated an ad for a fictitious apartment for rent and then used Facebook’s Boost feature to \npromote the ad in Washington, D.C.  Using the Facebook Pre-Populated List and the \n“exclusions” feature within Boost, the employee selected the preset options of those with \ninterests in “Telemundo,” “English as a second language,” and “Univision Deportes” to exclude \nfrom the Boost’s potential audience.  Facebook estimated that the Boost would reach 1.2 million \npeople.\n89. On January 3, 2018, an NFHA employee using a personal Facebook account \ncreated an ad for a fictitious apartment for rent and then used Facebook’s Boost feature to target \nthe ad to the Washington, D.C. market.  Using the Facebook Pre-Populated List and the \n“inclusion” feature within Boost, the employee selected the preset demographic option of “men,” \nthereby excluding women from the Boost’s potential audience.  Facebook estimated that the \nBoost would reach 500,000 people.    \n90. On January 3, 2018, an NFHA employee using a personal Facebook account \ncreated an ad for a fictitious apartment for rent and then used Facebook’s Boost feature to target \nthe ad to the Washington, D.C market.  Using the Facebook Pre-Populated List and the \n“exclusions” feature within Boost, the employee selected the preset demographic options of \n“parents with toddlers (01-02 years), parents with preschoolers (03-05 years), parents with early \n22\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689-JGK   Document 33   Filed 06/25/18   Page 23 of 58\nschool-age children (06-08 years), and parents with preteens (13-18 years)” to exclude families \nwith young children from the Boost’s potential audience.  Facebook estimated that the Boost \nwould reach 1.2 million people.   \n91. In January 2018 and February 2018, an NFHA employee using a personal \nFacebook account created multiple ads for fictitious apartments for rent and again used \nFacebook’s Boost feature to target each ad to the Washington, D.C. market.  The employee then \nused the Facebook Pre-Populated List and the “exclusion” features within Boost to select \nmultiple combinations of the  preset demographic options of “parents with toddlers (01-02),” \n“parents with preschoolers (03-05),” “parents with early school-age children (06-08),” “parents \nwith teenagers (13-18),” “parents with preteens (08-12),” “corporate moms,” “stay-at-home \nmoms,” “moms of grade school kids,” “moms of high school kids,” “fit moms,” “green moms,” \n“big-city moms,” “trendy moms,” “soccer moms,” and “moms of preschool kids” to exclude \nfamilies with young children and mothers from the Boost’s potential audience.  In many of these \nBoosts, and in additional Boosts targeted to the Washington, D.C. market, the employee used the \nFacebook Pre-Populated List and the “inclusion” feature within Boost to select the preset \ndemographic option of “men,” thereby excluding women from the Boosts’ potential audience.  \nFacebook estimated that these Boosts would reach anywhere from 58,000 to 580,000 people.   \nb. Ad Manager Investigation\n92. On December 14, 2017, an NFHA employee using a personal Facebook account \ncreated an ad using Facebook Ad Manager for a fictitious apartment for rent.  The employee \nselected Washington, D.C. as the market for the ad to run in.

Facebook estimated that \nthe ad would reach 77,000 people.   \n93. Throughout February 2018, an NFHA employee using a personal Facebook \naccount created additional ads for fictitious apartments for rent using Facebook Ad Manager and \nagain selected Washington, D.C. as the market for the ads to run in.  Using the Facebook Pre-\nPopulated List and the “exclusions” feature within Ad Manager, the employee selected \ncombinations of the preset options of “corporate moms,” “stay-at-home moms,” “moms of grade \nschool kids,” “moms of high school kids,” “fit moms,” “green moms,” “big-city moms,” “trendy \nmoms,” “soccer moms” and “moms of preschool kids” to exclude mothers from the ad’s \npotential audience.  In many of these ads and in additional ads targeted to the Washington, D.C. \nmarket, the employee used the Facebook Pre-Populated List and the “inclusion” feature within \nAd Manager to select the preset demographic option of “men,” thereby excluding women from \nthe ad’s potential audience.  Facebook estimated that these ads would reach anywhere from \n48,000 to 820,000 people.\nc. Investigation of Other Major Housing Markets  \n94. In light of its investigation of Facebook’s practices in the Washington, D.C. \nhousing market, NFHA investigated other major housing markets across the United States.  \n95. On February 1, 2018, an NFHA employee using a personal Facebook account \ncreated four ads for fictitious apartments for rent and then used Facebook’s Boost feature to \ntarget one ad each to four major markets in different regions of the country.  Using the Facebook \nPre-Populated List and Boost’s “inclusion” feature, the employee selected the preset interest \ninclusion option of “no kids” and the present demographic inclusion option of “men” to target \nfor the ad.  Using the “exclusions” feature within Boost for each ad,  the employee selected the \ndemographic preset options of “corporate moms,” “stay-at-home moms,” “moms of grade school \n24\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689-JGK   Document 33   Filed 06/25/18   Page 25 of 58\nkids,” “moms of high school kids,” “fit moms,” “green moms,”  “big-city moms,” “trendy \nmoms,” “soccer moms,” “moms of preschool kids,” “parents with toddlers (01-02),” “parents \nwith preschoolers (03-05),” “parents with early school-age children (06-08),” “parents with \nteenagers (13-18),” and “parents with preteens (08-12)” to exclude families with young children \nand mothers from each Boost’s potential audience.  Facebook estimated that these four Boosts \nwould reach a total of 463,000 people.   \n96. Having determined that Facebook had likely developed the same discriminatory \ncontent in other major housing markets, NFHA contacted three of its member groups; FHJC, \nHOPE, and FHCGSA.  NFHA provided these groups with training on how to use the Facebook \nadvertising features and conduct a similar investigation.  These groups investigated on their own \nand jointly with NFHA to assess Facebook’s discriminatory practices in their home markets.  \n2. Facebook’s Discrimination in the New York, New York Housing \nMarket\na. Boost Investigation\n97. On January 30, 2018, an NFHA employee using a personal Facebook account \ncreated an ad for a fictitious apartment for rent and then used Facebook’s Boost feature to target \nthe ad to the New York, New York market.

Common Allegations Regarding the Results of Plaintiffs’ Investigation into \nFacebook’s Discriminatory Housing Advertising   \n113. Facebook approved all of the Boosts and ads described above in paragraphs 87-\n112 in anywhere from one minute to approximately one hour.   \n114. After Facebook approved them, all of the Boosts and ads described above in \nparagraphs 87-112 were removed from Facebook by the respective persons who created them. \n115. Facebook’s Advertising Policies do not comply with the Fair Housing Act or with \nstate and local fair housing laws, including in New York.\n116. Under the caption “Discriminatory Practices,” Facebook states: “Ads must not \ndiscriminate or encourage discrimination against people based on personal attributes such as \nrace, ethnicity, color, national origin, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, \nfamily status, disability, medical or genetic condition.”24\n117. This policy misleads Facebook users because, for example, it does not state that \nthere are additional categories of prohibited discrimination in state and local fair housing laws \nsuch as marital status, military status, status as a survivor of domestic violence, lawful source of \nincome, including rental subsidies, and others. \n118. The policy further misstates the obligations imposed by the FHA because, among \nother things, it does not explain that indicating a preference or limitation based on a protected \ncharacteristic constitutes illegal discrimination and that advertisements that deny information \nabout housing opportunities to particular segments of the housing market violate the FHA. \n119. Although Facebook stopped approving housing advertisements that used its \n“ethnic affinity” option in late 2017, it continues to curate an entire system of discriminatory \n24 Facebook, Discriminatory Practices,\nhttps://www.facebook.com/policies/ads/prohibited_content/discriminatory_practices# (last visited June 25, 2018).\n33\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689-JGK   Document 33   Filed 06/25/18   Page 34 of 58\nadvertising—analyzing and repurposing user data to create and develop content created so that \nadvertisers can exclude protected classes from receiving housing ads.  \n120. Facebook created the Pre-Populated List so that landlords and real estate agents \ncan target certain persons or groups for, and exclude other persons or groups from, receiving \nhousing ads.\n121. The vast majority of the categories provided on the Facebook Pre-Populated List \nare not from data voluntarily given by users.  Instead, through its own analysis of user data, \nFacebook develops and provides these new and salient categories so that landlords and real estate \nagents can include and exclude people from receiving housing advertisements, including on the \nbasis of family status. \n122. Between December 14, 2017 and February 23, 2018, Facebook accepted for \npublication 40 advertisements from Plaintiffs that excluded potential home seekers on the basis \nof family status and/or sex.   \n123. Facebook also uses the data it gathers from its users’ online activity to create \n“interests” categories for housing advertisements that permit a landlord or real estate firm to \nexclude users based on disability-related factors (for example, by checking the pre-populated \ncategory of “Interest in Disabled Parking Permit”) and national origin (for example, “Interest in \nTelemundo”). \n124. These categories deny information about housing opportunities to persons with \ndisabilities, persons living with or associating with persons with disabilities, and/or persons who \nare Hispanic or speak Spanish and are more likely to be Hispanic.  These Facebook-created \n“interest” categories are the equivalent of demographic exclusion categories labeled “disability” \n34\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689-JGK   Document 33   Filed 06/25/18   Page 35 of 58\nor “Hispanic.”  There is no lawful reason for Facebook to create this content so that advertisers \ncan exclude potential audience members for housing ads on these bases.\n125. As recently as March 23, 2018, an NFHA employee attempted to “edit” an ad that \nit created in November 2016 that excluded potential audience members only on the basis of race \nand national origin.  The employee received a message from Facebook stating that “some of the \ndetailed targeting selections you originally used in your Saved Audience are no longer \navailable.  They won’t show up in this audience targeting, but the associated ads will still deliver \nto the original audience.  However, you’ll be unable to use these detailed targeting selections if \nyou edit this audience or try running future ads with it.” (emphasis added).  \n126. Based on this message, it appears that even though Facebook removed \ndiscriminatory demographic selections that allowed advertisers to exclude on the basis of race \nand national origin from the Facebook Pre-Populated List, it still allows previously existing ads \nthat excluded or targeted on these bases to continue to do so. \n127. When Facebook users grant Facebook access to their data, they do not authorize \nFacebook to use that data to discriminate against them on the basis of their protected \ncharacteristics, such as their sex, family status, race, national origin, and disability status.  By \nexploiting users’ data in this manner, Facebook transforms the character of the data in a manner \nto which the users did not consent and could not reasonably foresee.\n128. There is no lawful purpose for a housing advertiser to include or exclude a \nprospective renter from viewing a housing ad on the basis of that renter’s sex, family status, \ndisability status, race, or national origin.\n129. By creating the Facebook Pre-Populated List, a database that sorts users by these \nprotected characteristics and allows advertisers to include and exclude its audience members on \n35\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689-JGK   Document 33   Filed 06/25/18   Page 36 of 58\nthose bases, Facebook materially contributes to ongoing violations of the Fair Housing Act made \nthrough its advertising platform. \n130. By exploiting user data, gathered from analyzing Facebook users’ activities on \nFacebook, Instagram, and elsewhere throughout the internet, to create new categories based on \nthese protected characteristics within the Facebook Pre-Populated List, Facebook materially \ncontributes to ongoing violations of the Fair Housing Act made through its advertising platform. \n131. By creating and developing algorithms that use data regarding protected \ncharacteristics such as sex, familial status, disability, race, and national origin to create \n“suggested” or “lookalike” audiences for advertisers, Facebook materially contributes to ongoing \nviolations of the Fair Housing Act made through its advertising platform.  \n132. Plaintiffs’ investigation demonstrates that despite notice from NFHA and other \ncivil rights groups as early as 2016 of its clear violations of the federal Fair Housing Act, \nFacebook has continued to engage in discriminatory housing advertising practices.   \n133. Facebook has acted intentionally, willfully, and with reckless disregard of existing \nfederal and local fair housing rights.\nHARM TO PLAINTIFFS CAUSED BY FACEBOOK THROUGH DIVERSION \nOF RESOURCES AND FRUSTRATION OF MISSION \n134. Facebook’s discriminatory and unlawful practices have frustrated and continue to \nfrustrate each Plaintiff’s mission of ensuring that all people have equal access to housing \nopportunities and promoting residential integration across the country, as well as in the New \nYork City, Washington, D.C., Miami, and San Antonio metropolitan areas. \n135. In an effort to address and to counteract the effects of Defendant’s discriminatory \nconduct, prior to the filing of this action, each of the Plaintiffs has diverted resources and staff \nfrom other activities to investigate and document Defendant’s policies and practices.  Each \n36\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689-JGK   Document 33   Filed 06/25/18   Page 37 of 58\nPlaintiff also engaged in public education efforts, prior to this filing, to raise awareness of \ndiscriminatory housing advertising practices in the communities each Plaintiff serves. \n136. Prior to the filing of this Complaint, NFHA diverted and expended financial \nresources and staff time to, among other things, design and implement the investigation, \nincluding time to train and work with other Plaintiffs on their investigations; review and analyze \nthe investigative results; and conduct legal research and seek legal advice from attorneys.    \n137. FHJC, HOPE, and FHCGSA each expended staff time and other resources to \ninvestigate Defendant’s advertising practices, which diverted staff and resources away from \nother organizational activities, prior to the filing of this Complaint.  Among other things, FHJC, \nHOPE, and FHCGSA spent time being trained by NFHA to use Facebook’s advertising platform, \ncreate a non-existent realty firm, and design and document their efforts to create and place \nhousing advertisements on Facebook. \n138. If Facebook had complied with the requirements of the FHA after being informed \nof them by NFHA, then Plaintiffs would not have devoted considerable staff time and resources \nto identify the nature and scope of Facebook’s advertising policies and practices.\n139. Each Plaintiff’s mission is frustrated when Facebook excludes members of the \npublic from access to housing advertising and information about housing opportunities based on \ntheir sex, familial status, disability, race, national origin, or other protected characteristics. \n140. Because Facebook’s discriminatory advertising practices alleged in this \nComplaint violate federal, state, and local fair housing laws, they undermine rather than advance \nequal housing opportunity and perpetuate the harms of residential segregation.   \n141. To address and attempt to counteract the effects of Facebook’s discriminatory \nconduct, prior to the filing of this action, each Plaintiff has engaged in public education \n37\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689-JGK   Document 33   Filed 06/25/18   Page 38 of 58\ncampaigns to raise public awareness of the problem of discriminatory housing advertising and to \neducate housing providers about their legal obligations under fair housing laws not to advertise \nhousing for rent or sale in a discriminatory manner. \n142. In early 2018, NFHA drafted guidelines for housing advertisers that it posted on \nits website in English and Spanish with a link to specific information about each state’s fair \nhousing laws, a copy of the HUD fair housing logo for advertisers to use, previously produced \npublic service announcements, and a recorded webinar on discriminatory advertising held by \nNFHA in April 2017. \n143. In early 2018, each Plaintiff expended staff time to develop education campaigns \nand design advertisements for social media aimed to reach housing providers who place ads and \nconsumers searching for housing in the Washington D.C., New York City, Miami, and San \nAntonio metropolitan regions.  Plaintiffs posted these ads on Facebook and Twitter on an \nongoing basis, including translating ads into Spanish. \n144. During this same time period, each Plaintiff expended staff time to communicate \nand coordinate with each other about their individual education campaigns to ensure Plaintiffs \nwere providing a consistent message reaching both housing providers and consumers in each \nmetropolitan area.  Each Plaintiff also has expended staff time prior to filing this Complaint to \nbegin to design workshops, a webinar, consumer flyers, and/or fact sheets.  Finally, NFHA has \nbegun to contact online education providers who offer courses on using social media for \nadvertising to request that they distribute information about housing advertising guidelines and \nbest practices that comply with fair housing laws. \n38\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689-JGK   Document 33   Filed 06/25/18   Page 39 of 58\n145. As a direct and proximate result of Facebook’s discriminatory practices described \nabove, each Plaintiff has suffered and will continue to suffer a diversion of its resources and a \nfrustration of its mission. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a), (c), (d), (f): Familial Status, Sex, Disability, Race, and \nNational Origin Discrimination) \n146. Plaintiffs restate and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs above as \nif fully set forth herein. \n147. The housing advertised for rent or sale on Facebook using the platform described \nabove are “dwellings” as defined by the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3602(b). \n148. Facebook’s creation of unlawful preset categories on its advertising platform, \nexploitation of user data to create those categories, and use of those categories to create \ndiscriminatory “suggested” or “lookalike” audiences illegally discriminated against, and \ncontinues to discriminate against, Plaintiffs by:\na. Making unavailable or denying a dwelling to any person because of sex, familial \nstatus, race or national origin.  42 U.S.C. § 3604(a).\nb.  Making, printing, or publishing, or causing to be made, printed, or published any \nnotice, statement, or advertisement, with respect to the sale or rental of a dwelling \nthat indicates any preference, limitation, or discrimination based on sex, disability \nfamilial status, race or national origin, or an intention to make any such preference, \nlimitation, or discrimination.  42 U.S.C. § 3604(c). \nc.

Plaintiffs are aggrieved persons as defined by the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 3602(i), and have sustained damages as a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s unlawful \ndiscriminatory conduct.  \n150. Accordingly, under 42 U.S.C. § 3613(c), Plaintiffs are entitled to actual damages, \npunitive damages, injunctive relief, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3606: Familial Status, Sex, Disability, Race, and National Origin \nDiscrimination) \n151. Plaintiffs restate and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs above as \nif fully set forth herein. \n152. The housing advertised for rent or sale on Facebook using the platform described \nabove are “dwellings” as defined by the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3602(b). \n153. Facebook provides a “service . . . relating to the business of selling or renting \ndwellings” within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 3606.\n154. Facebook’s creation of unlawful preset categories on its advertising platform, \nexploitation of user data to create those categories, and use of those categories to create \ndiscriminatory “suggested” or “lookalike” audiences illegally discriminated against, and \ncontinues to discriminate against, Plaintiffs by “deny[ing] any person access to . . . [Facebook’s] \nservice, organization, or facility relating to the business of selling or renting dwellings,[and] \ndiscriminat[ing] against [such persons] in the terms or conditions of such access, membership, or \n40\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689-JGK   Document 33   Filed 06/25/18   Page 41 of 58\nparticipation, on account of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national \norigin.” \n155. Plaintiffs are aggrieved persons as defined by the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 3602(i), and have sustained damages as a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s unlawful \ndiscriminatory conduct.  \n156. Accordingly, under 42 U.S.C. § 3613(c), Plaintiffs are entitled to actual damages, \npunitive damages, injunctive relief, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Plaintiffs NFHA and FHJC) \n (New York City Human Rights Law: Aiding and Abetting\nFamilial Status and Gender Discrimination)  \n157. New York City Administrative Code § 8-107(6) declares that it “shall be an \nunlawful discriminatory practice for any person to aid, abet, incite, compel or coerce the doing of \nany of the acts forbidden under this chapter.” \n158. The housing advertised for rent or sale on Facebook using the platform described \nabove are “housing accommodations” as defined by the New York City Human Rights Law, \nN.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-102(10).\n159. Facebook’s creation of unlawful preset categories on its advertising platform, \nexploitation of user data to create those categories, and use of those categories to create \ndiscriminatory “suggested” or “lookalike” audiences constitutes aiding, abetting, inciting and \ncompelling the doing of acts forbidden under Section 8-107(5)(3) of the New York City \nAdministrative Code, including the “declar[ing], print[ing] or circulat[ing] or caus[ing] to be \ndeclared, printed or circulated any statement, advertisement or publication . . . which expresses, \ndirectly or indirectly, any limitation, specification or discrimination as to race, creed, color, \nnational origin, gender, age, disability, sexual orientation, marital status, partnership status, or \n41\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02689-JGK   Document 33   Filed 06/25/18   Page 42 of 58\nalienage or citizenship status, or any lawful source of income, or whether children are, may be, \nor would be residing with a person, or any intent to make such limitation, specification or \ndiscrimination” (emphasis added).  \n160. Facebook’s creation of these unlawful preset categories on its platform for \nhousing advertisements violated, and continues to violate, Section 8-107(5)(e) by denying \npersons access to Facebook’s real estate advertisements on the basis of familial status and \ngender.\n161. NFHA and FHJC are “aggrieved persons” as defined in Section 8-502(a) of the \nNew York City Administrative Code, and have suffered damages as a direct and proximate result \nof Defendant’s discriminatory conduct. \n162. Accordingly, under Section 502(a) and (g) of the New York City Administrative \nCode, NFHA and FHJC are entitled to actual damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief, and \nreasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request judgment against Defendant as follows: \n(a) Declaring that Defendant’s discriminatory policies and practices violate the Fair \nHousing Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq. and the New York City \nHuman Rights Law, N.Y.C.
