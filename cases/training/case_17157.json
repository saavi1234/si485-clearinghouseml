    "summary": "<p>Riddick v. Facebook is a lawsuit brought to hold Facebook accountable for discriminatory advertising practices relating to users’ personal characteristics such as sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, marital status, citizenship, primary language, immigration status, and age. Facebook’s discriminatory practices violate California Civil Code Sections 51, 51.5, and 52. </p><p>This lawsuit was brought in concurrence with 66 civil rights lawsuits filed against employers including employers Nebraska Furniture Mart, Sandhills Publishing Company, Need Work Today, Renewal by Andersen LLC, Rice Tire, JK Moving Services, Enhanced Roofing & Modeling, and Xenith for using Facebook ads to discriminate on the basis of race, gender, age, disability, and other protected classes. The claims were filed in response to an <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-advertising-discrimination-housing-race-sex-national-origin\"> investigation by ProPublica</a> which exposed the discriminatory advertising on Facebook. In November 2016, the first civil rights lawsuit was filed against Facebook in California, on behalf of millions of people of color who had missed opportunities for housing, jobs, and credit. This prompted a second major lawsuit by the <a href=\"https://nationalfairhousing.org/2018/03/27/facebook-sued-by-civil-rights-groups-for-discrimination-in-online-housing-advertisements/\">Fair Housing Advocates</a> in New York. </p><p>On July 26, 2018, this action was moved to federal court under the Class Action Fairness Act. Facebook moved to consider whether this action was related to <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15527\">Onuoha v. Facebook (Mobley v. Facebook) (N.D. Cal.)</a>. On September 10, 2018, the court found that the cases were not related. Additionally, on October 31, 2018, Facebook moved to dismiss the plaintiff's second amended complaint.</p><p>Facebook lawyers initially moved to have Riddick v. Facebook and the four related cases dismissed. When the CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, testified before congress earlier in April 2018, he acknowledged that protecting people from illegal ad discrimination was a work in progress. Following the hearing, Facebook agreed to a civil rights audit. The holistic review of all possible civil rights issues on Facebook was led by Laura Murphy, the former head of the ACLU in Washington, and included experts from the Congressional Black Caucus, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus. The outcome of this review led to a settlement of this charge and several other pending cases. </p><p>Prior to settlement, on November 19, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint. The plaintiffs alleged that Facebook and other advertiser defendants violated the Unruh Civil Rights Act and the California Civil Code by collaborating \"in creating, developing, and/or utilizing\" tools to \"not publish, not provide, and not send ads and the information in those ads\" to persons \"based on their protected personal characteristics.\" </p><p>In March 2019, <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/03/facebook-settles-civil-rights-lawsuits-over-ad-discrimination/\">Facebook reached settlements</a> in three civil rights cases and two complaints before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over ad discrimination on its platform. The settlement included Riddick v. Facebook (N.D. Cal.), <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17161\">Communications Workers of America v. Facebook (EEOC)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17159\">Spees v. Facebook (EEOC)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15527\">Mobley v. Facebook (N.D. Cal.)</a>,  and <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17155\">National Fair Housing Alliance v. Facebook (S.D.N.Y)</a>, all available on the Clearinghouse. Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg commented on the settlement in a blog post: “There is a long history of discrimination in the areas of housing, employment, and credit, and this harmful behavior should not happen through Facebook ads…We can do better.” Sandburg attributed the civil rights audit in Facebook’s decision to settle.  </p><p>The terms of the settlement included promises by Facebook to make significant changes to their advertising tools to curb the availability of advertisers to target users based on protected characteristics. The changes will affect Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger. Facebook agreed to create a separate portal for ads in areas of housing, employment and credit. The parties agreed to monitor the changes for three years and to study the potential that the algorithm creates unintended bias. Finally, Facebook promised to change how it targets audiences for advertisements without using protected classes like race and gender to generate an audience. On March 19, 2019, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their complaint. </p><p>As of April 2020, the settlement was being enforced.</p>",

This case is about unlawful discrimination on steroids. Facebook and its co-defendant \n24 \nadvertisers have intentionally discriminated against tens or hundreds of millions of Facebook users by \n25 \ncollaborating in creating and/or developing the information or content in thousands or millions of \n26 \nadvertisements that were not published, not provided, and not sent to millions of Facebook users based \n27 \non users’ personal characteristics such as sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, marital \n28 \n1   \n                \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCase No. 3:18-cv-04529-LB \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-04529-LB   Document 26   Filed 11/19/18   Page 2 of 35\n \n \n1  status, citizenship, primary language, immigration status, age, or those characteristics added by the \n2  courts, all of which are protected from being used to discriminate against people by California Civil \n3  Code sections 51 (codification of the Unruh Civil Rights Act) and 51.5. Facebook and its co-defendant \n4  advertisers have collaborated in creating or developing Facebook’s Multicultural Affinity (née “Ethnic \n5  Affinity”1) (hereinafter “Multicultural Affinity”) advertising platform feature and therefore in creating \n6  or developing the information or content in ads that were never published, never provided, and never \n7  sent to certain disfavored Facebook users, who are the Class members defined below, based on the \n8  users’ personal characteristics protected by Civil Code sections 51 and 51.5.   \n9  2.  Facebook’s Multicultural Affinity advertising feature has been used by Facebook and \n10  its co-defendant advertisers, including by Facebook itself as an advertiser, to not publish, not provide, \n11  and not send information in advertisements to Facebook users who would have benefited from the \n12  information in such non-published ads for sales, discounts, coupons, limited quantities, free shipping, \n13  or other special offers, promotions, employment opportunities, housing, products, accommodations, \n14  advantages facilities, privileges, or services but for the disfavored users’ real or perceived personal \n15  characteristics protected by Civil Code sections 51 and 51.5. \n16  3.  Facebook has also created or developed content in advertisements for Facebook itself \n17  that Facebook did not publish, did not provide, and did not send to certain Facebook users based on \n18  personal characteristics protected by the Unruh Civil Rights Act and by Civil Code section 51.5. This \n19  includes, but is not limited to, Facebook having restricted employment ads for jobs with Facebook to \n20 \n                                                                 \n21 \n1 After Plaintiffs filed their original Complaint in this case, Facebook changed the name \n22 \nof its ad platform feature from “Ethnic Affinity” to “Multicultural Affinity.” The term \n23  “Multicultural Affinity” will be used throughout this Third Amended Complaint to also \ninclude its former title of “Ethnic Affinity.” Also, while this is entitled the “Third \n24 \nAmended Complaint,” this is Plaintiff’s first amendment to their complaint since \n25  Facebook removed this case from San Mateo County Superior Court to this U.S. \nDistrict Court. At the San Mateo County Superior Plaintiffs unilaterally filed a First \n26 \nAmended Complaint to exclude members of that Superior Court and Plaintiff’s law \n27 \nfirm as class members, and the Superior Court granted Plaintiffs leave to file a Second \n28  Amended Complaint over eighteen months after the original complaint was filed in \n2   \nNovember of 2016 after Plaintiffs learned more facts about Facebook’s ad platform. \n                \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCase No. 3:18-cv-04529-LB \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-04529-LB   Document 26   Filed 11/19/18   Page 3 of 35\n \n \n1  people “ages 21 to 55” and “ages 25 to 60,” which Facebook developed and created but did not publish, \n2  provide, or send to Facebook users who Facebook determined or perceived to not be between 21 and \n3  55 years old or not be between 25 and 60 years old. Upon information and belief, Facebook also \n4  created and developed content in many other advertisements for Facebook’s services or products and \n5  these other advertisements also utilized Facebook’s Multicultural Affinity advertising feature to not \n6  publish, not provide, or not send these advertisements to Facebook users based on users’ sex, race, \n7  color, religion, ancestry, national origin, marital status, citizenship, primary language, immigration \n8  status, age, or those characteristics added by the courts.  \n9  4.  Both  Civil  Code  sections  51  and  51.5  prohibit  business  establishments  such  as \n10  Facebook and its advertisers from  discriminating against people based  on any of  the personal \n11  characteristics listed in Civil Code section 51 and those added by judicial construction, as well as from \n12  discriminating against people based on the perception that the people being treated unequally bear or \n13  possess any of those protected personal characteristics. \n14  5.  Defendant Facebook, under the auspices of being a social-networking site, mines, \n15  collects, purchases, and assembles into individual profiles countless terabytes of data in multitudes of \n16  categories, for whom Facebook claims to be approximately two billion monthly active Facebook users \n17  worldwide, as well as on other individuals who do not even have Facebook accounts, in order for \n18  Facebook and its advertisers to publish, provide, and send ads to certain groups of Facebook users, \n19  and, more importantly, to enable Facebook and its advertisers to not publishing, not providing, and \n20  not sending ads to certain other Facebook users. As alleged more fully below, Facebook and its co-\n21  defendant advertisers have collaborated to  create, develop, implement, market, and use an advertising \n22  platform  (“Ad  Platform”)  that  has  created  and  developed  advertisements  for  products, \n23  accommodations,  advantages,  facilities,  privileges,  employment  opportunities,  housing,  and \n24  services—including, but not limited to advertisements for sales, discounts, coupons, limited quantities, \n25  free shipping, or other special offers—that defendants intentionally have not published, not provided, \n26  and not sent to Facebook users based on their real or perceived protected personal characteristics. By \n27  purposefully and intentionally collaborating to create, develop, and/or use (1) the “Exclude People” \n28  feature, or (2) another feature that advertisers have used to include only certain users with favored \n3   \n                \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCase No. 3:18-cv-04529-LB \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-04529-LB   Document 26   Filed 11/19/18   Page 4 of 35\n \n \n1  personal characteristics and thereby exclude those users who are not lucky enough to have the favored \n2  personal characteristics (hereinafter “Include People” feature), such as those protected by Civil Code \n3  sections 51 and 51.5, defendants have knowingly and intentionally prevented ads and the information \n4  and content therein from being published, provided, or sent to users who do not match certain personal \n5  characteristics such as “African American (US),” “Asian American (US),” “Immigrant,” “Hispanic \n6  US – English dominant,” “Christian,” “Moms,” and “people ages 21 to 55 who live or were recently \n7  in the United States.”  \n8  6.  Facebook,  through  its  creation,  development,  implementation,  promotion,  and \n9  marketing of its Multicultural Affinity, Exclude People, or Include People tools, and through its \n10  collaboration with its advertisers in the use of these tools, has substantially and affirmatively induced \n11  its  advertisers  to  express  illegal  preferences  of  Facebook  users  based  on  the  users’  personal \n12  characteristics or perceived personal characteristics as assigned secretly by Facebook, all of which are \n13  protected by Civil Code sections 51 and 51.5. Facebook, along with its advertisers, have been \n14  responsible, in whole or in part, for the creation or development of the offending content. Facebook’s \n15  substantial affirmative conduct in promoting its advertisers’ use of its Multicultural Affinity, Exclude \n16  People, or Include People tools for unlawful purposes has resulted in the unlawful discrimination of \n17  many Facebook users. All of this conduct, as further detailed below, makes Facebook a creator or \n18  developer of the information or content in the ads that are not published, not provided, and not sent to \n19  Facebook users based on the users’ genuine or perceived protected personal characteristics. Therefore, \n20  Facebook is an information content provider for the ads that are published, provided, and sent to \n21  Facebook users based on those users’ protected personal characteristics, or the perception created by \n22  Facebook from data collected by Facebook or acquired by Facebook from other data collection firms \n23  of those users’ protected personal characteristics. \n24  7.  But this Third Amended Complaint concerns the information or content not published, \n25  not provided, and not sent to the members of the Class by Facebook and its advertiser co-defendants. \n26  If instead of not publishing, not providing, and not sending the information or content in the ads to \n27  Class members, defendants had just published, provided, or sent the information or content in the ads \n28  to the Class members, Plaintiffs would not have filed this lawsuit, because there would not have been \n4   \n                \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCase No. 3:18-cv-04529-LB \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-04529-LB   Document 26   Filed 11/19/18   Page 5 of 35\n \n \n1  any unlawful discrimination such as that alleged herein. \n2  8.  It is especially troubling that Facebook, whose corporate mission statement is “to give \n3  people the power to build community and bring the world closer together,”  would create and develop \n4  an Ad Platform with its anti-diversity Multicultural Affinity tool that Facebook and its advertisers \n5  have used to not publish, not provide, and not send information or content to many in Facebook’s \n6  community while defendants published, provided, and sent the same information and content to other \n7  Facebook community members. This has destroyed any sense of commonality or “community,” and \n8  has separated the Facebook world into at least two camps: an informed community of Facebook users \n9  on one side, and an uniformed community of Facebook users on the other side. \n10  9.  After Plaintiffs filed their original Complaint in this case, Facebook COO Sheryl \n11  Sandberg announced that Facebook would seemingly at least temporarily disable the “exclude” feature \n12  in its Multicultural Affinity tool, as follows: \n13  Until we can better ensure that our tools will not be used inappropriately, we are \n14  disabling the option that permits advertisers to exclude multicultural affinity segments \n15  from the audience for their ads. In addition, all advertisers will have to complete the \n16  certification described above when they choose to include any of the multicultural \n17  affinity segments. We will also conduct a full review of how exclusion targeting is being \n18  used across audience segments, focusing particularly on potentially sensitive segments \n19  (e.g., segments that relate to the LGBTQ community or to people with disabilities). \n20  Sheryl Sandberg’s November 29, 2017, letter to the Congressional Black Caucus. Available at \nhttps://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4312370-Facebook-Sheryl-Sandberg-Letter-\n21 \n2017-11-29.html \n22   \n10.  However, Ms. Sandberg’s announcement seemingly only temporarily disabled the \n23 \nExclude People feature with her provisional, “Until we can better ensure that our ad tools will not be \n24 \nused inappropriately . . .”, emphasis added, language. Moreover, by maintaining that “all advertisers \n25 \nwill have to complete the certification described above when they choose to include any of the \n26 \nmulticultural affinity segments” - emphasis added, Facebook taketh back what it giveth away. This is \n27 \nbecause whenever people include individuals with any favored personal characteristic, such as to \n28 \n5   \n                \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCase No. 3:18-cv-04529-LB \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-04529-LB   Document 26   Filed 11/19/18   Page 6 of 35\n \n \n1  include African-American, 18 to 55-year-olds, heterosexuals, or Muslims, they exclude individuals \n2  with the disfavored personal characteristics, such as Latinos, Asian-Americans, Caucasians, senior \n3  citizens, members of the LGBTQ community, or Christians and Jews. This has the same effect as the \n4  seemingly temporarily discarded “exclude” feature, but only rebranded with the new, and innocuous-\n5  sounding “include” moniker. \n6  11.  Ms. Sandberg, as Facebook’s COO has stated that “We believe advertisers and us \n7  should be held accountable for content and ads.”  Plaintiffs, by filing their original Complaint in \n8  November of 2016, and by filing this Third Amended Complaint, endeavor to ensure that Facebook \n9  and its advertisers are held accountable for their discriminatory practices of withholding content and \n10  ads, and that defendants stop their discriminatory practices and finally begin to treat Facebook users \n11  around the world equally no matter their sex, race, religion, sexual orientation, citizenship, and other \n12  real or perceived protected personal characteristics. \n13  12.  Since Plaintiffs’ original Complaint was filed in November of 2016, Facebook, in court \n14  filings in this case and in a related federal court discrimination lawsuit against Facebook, has attempted \n15  to avoid liability by cavalierly throwing its co-defendant advertisers under the bus by implicating its \n16  advertisers as the ones solely responsible for creating or developing the information in the ads that \n17  were not published, provided, or sent to the Class, which could only have been accomplished by using \n18  the Multicultural Affinity tool at the center of this lawsuit. For example, in Facebook’s Demurrer to \n19  Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint, Facebook contended, “Because Facebook plays no role in the \n20  creation of ads or in the advertiser’s targeting decisions, advertisers, not Facebook, are the only \n21  “information content provider[s]” of the content at issue. (47 U.S.C. § 230(f)(3).) Nor does it matter \n22  that Plaintiffs seek to hold Facebook liable for aiding violations committed by third-party advertisers: \n23  such claims are precisely the kind of claims precluded by the [Communications Decency Act].”  \n24  Facebooks  claims  that  Facebook  has  nothing  to  do  with  advertisers’  targeting  decisions  is \n25  demonstrably,  patently  false,  as  revealed  in  the  following  excerpts  from  a  recent  Bloomberg \n26  Businessweek article titled “How Facebook Helps Shady Advertisers Pollute the Internet”, available \n27  at https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-03-27/ad-scammers-need-suckers-and-facebook-\n28  helps-find-them : \n6   \n                \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCase No. 3:18-cv-04529-LB \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-04529-LB   Document 26   Filed 11/19/18   Page 7 of 35\n \n \n1  “Granted anonymity, affiliates were happy to detail their tricks. They told me that Facebook \n2  had revolutionized scamming. The company built tools with its trove of user data that made it \n3  the go-to platform for big brands. Affiliates hijacked them. Facebook’s targeting algorithm is \n4  so powerful, they said, they don’t need to identify suckers themselves – Facebook does it \n5  automatically.” \n6   \n7  The Bloomberg article further reads: \n8  “Affiliates once had to guess what kind of person might fall for their unsophisticated cons, \n9  targeting ads by age, geography, or interests. Now Facebook does the work for them. The \n10  social network tracks who clicks on the ad and who buys the pills, then starts targeting others \n11  whom its algorithm thinks are likely to buy. Affiliates describe watching their ad campaigns \n12  lose money for a few days as Facebook gathers data through trial and error, then seeing the \n13  sales take off exponentially. “They go out and find the morons for me,” I was told by an affiliate \n14  who sells deceptively priced skin-care creams with fake endorsements from Chelsea Clinton.” \n15   \nCALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTIONS 51, 51.5, AND 52  \n16 \nAND CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT \n \n17 \n13.

Civil Code section 52 which provides the remedies for violations of Civil Code sections \n4 \n51, 51.5 (and 51.6), reads, in pertinent part, as follows: \n5 \n \n6 \n(a) Whoever denies, aids or incites a denial, or makes any discrimination or \n7 \ndistinction contrary to Section 51, 51.5, or 51.6, is liable for each and every \n8 \noffense for the actual damages, and any amount that may be determined by a \n9  jury, or a court sitting without a jury, up to a maximum of three times the \namount of actual damage but in no case less than four thousand dollars ($4,000), \n10 \nand any attorney’s fees that may be determined by the court in addition thereto, \n11  suffered by any person denied the rights provided in Section 51, 51.5, or 51.6. \n \n12 \n16.  Before January 1, 2016, Civil Code section 51 did not include citizenship, primary \n13 \nlanguage, or immigration status in its list of enumerated personal characteristics, and therefore section \n14 \n51.5, which adopts the personal characteristics listed in section 51, also did not specifically include \n15 \nthese three personal characteristics.  But in 2015, the California Legislature passed, and on September \n16 \n8, 2015, Governor Gerald Brown signed into law, Senate Bill 600, which would become effective on \n17 \nJanuary 1, 2016, and added citizenship, primary language, and immigration status to the personal \n18 \ncharacteristics enumerated in Civil Code section 51, and therefore adopted by Civil Code section 51.5. \n19 \n17.  Despite  California’s  many  anti-discrimination  statutes,  California  Supreme  Court \n20 \nprecedent, and California Attorney General and Department of Fair Employment and Housing actions \n21 \nthat prohibit businesses operating in California from treating consumers unequally based on protected \n22 \npersonal characteristics such as sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, marital status, \n23 \ncitizenship, primary language, immigration status, or age, Facebook and its co-defendant advertisers  \n24 \nhave  created,  developed,  and/or  utilized  the  Multicultural  Affinity  tool  and  the  discriminatory \n25 \ninformation and content Facebook and its advertisers provided in Facebook and its advertisers’ ads to \n26 \ntreat Facebook users unequally by not publishing, not providing, and not sending Facebook users ads \n27 \nand the information or content in those ads based on the users’ personal characteristics protected by \n28 \nthe Unruh Civil Rights Act and Civil Code section8  5  1.5.  \n                \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCase No. 3:18-cv-04529-LB \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-04529-LB   Document 26   Filed 11/19/18   Page 9 of 35\n \n \n1  18.  The sole reason or motive for Facebook and its co-defendant advertisers’ collaboration \n2  to create, develop, and/or utilize the discriminatory Multicultural Affinity tool and its Exclude People \n3  and Include People features has been to maximize profit for Facebook and its advertisers, regardless \n4  of the discriminatory intent and effect.  The California Supreme Court in the Unruh Civil Rights Act \n5  case of Koire v. Metro Car Wash (1985) 40 Cal.3d 24 strongly denounced businesses that treated \n6  customers unequally based on a protected personal characteristic listed in Civil Code section 51 to \n7  maximize profits, as set forth below: \n8   \n9  In  Marina  Point,  this  court  held  that  the  fact  that  a  business  enterprise  was \n\"'[proceeding] from a motive of rational self-interest'\" did not justify discrimination.  \n10 \n(Marina Point, supra, 30 Cal.3d at p. 740, fn. 9, disapproving Newby v. Alto Riviera \n11  Apartments (1976) 60 Cal. App. 3d 288, 302 [131 Cal. Rptr. 547].) This court noted \nthat \"an entrepreneur may pursue many discriminatory practices 'from a motive of \n12 \nrational self-interest,' e.g., economic gain, which would unquestionably violate the \n13 \nUnruh Act. For example, an entrepreneur may find it economically advantageous to \n14  exclude all homosexuals, or alternatively all nonhomosexuals, from his restaurant or \nhotel, but such a 'rational' economic motive would not, of course, validate the \n15 \npractice.\" (Marina Point, supra, 30 Cal.3d at p. 740, fn. 9.) It would be no less a \n16  violation  of  the  Act  for  an  entrepreneur  to  charge  all  homosexuals,  or  all \nnonhomosexuals, reduced rates in his or her restaurant or hotel in order to encourage \n17 \none  group's  patronage  and,  thereby,  increase  profits.    The  same  reasoning  is \n18  applicable here, where reduced rates were offered to women and not men. \n19 \nKoire, 40 Cal.3d at 35.     \n20 \nThe nightclub attempts to justify its price discount as “remedial” because women tend \n21  to have lower incomes than men.  This argument appears to be disingenuous at best.  \nThe club’s profit motive is obvious.  Jezebel’s waives the cover charge for women \n22 \nnot because women on the average earn 59 cents for every dollar earned by men \n23 \n(Koziara, Pierson & Johannesson, The Comparable Worth Issue: Current Status and \n24  New Directions (1983) 34 Lab. L.J. 504, 505), but because it wants to earn as many \ndollars as it can for itself.  “Ladies’ Night” at Jezebel's is not for the benefit of women, \n25 \nbut for the benefit of the nightclub. \n26 \nKoire, 40 Cal.3d at 37 n.18. \n27 \n \n28 \n9   \n                \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCase No. 3:18-cv-04529-LB \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-04529-LB   Document 26   Filed 11/19/18   Page 10 of 35\n \n \n1  19.  In a subsequent California Supreme Court Unruh Act case of Angelucci v. Century \n2  Supper Club (2007) 41 Cal.4th 160, 167, the Court, in holding that a business could not charge men \n3  more than women to be admitted into a supper club because sex discrimination is prohibited by the \n4  Unruh Act, perhaps best summarized the purpose and intent of the Unruh Act as follows:  \n5   \n6  The Unruh Civil Rights Act (Civ. Code, § 51 et seq.) must be construed liberally in \norder to carry out its purpose. The act expresses a state and national policy against \n7 \ndiscrimination on arbitrary grounds. Its provisions are intended as an active measure \n8  that creates and preserves a nondiscriminatory environment in California business \nestablishments by banishing or eradicating arbitrary, invidious discrimination by \n9 \nsuch establishments. The act stands as a bulwark protecting each person’s inherent \n10 \nright to full and equal access to all business establishments (§ 51, subd. (b)). The act \n11  imposes a compulsory duty upon business establishments to serve all persons without \narbitrary discrimination. The act serves as a preventive measure, without which it is \n12 \nrecognized that businesses might fall into discriminatory practices.  \n13   \n \n14 \nFACEBOOK’S AD PLATFORM AND MULTICULTURAL AFFINITY TOOL \n15 \n20.  Facebook generates most of its revenue through the sale of advertising. In the second \n16 \nquarter of 2017, Facebook generated $9.16 billion in advertising revenue. \n17 \n21.  As set out in more detail below, Facebook’s Multicultural Affinity tool aids, allows, \n18 \nand enables advertisers, including Facebook itself, to intentionally exclude specific Facebook users \n19 \nfrom seeing or hearing certain ads and the information or content in those ads. This age-based, sex-\n20 \nbased, race-based, etc. exclusion is based on Facebook users’ “affinity” groups that are assigned to \n21 \nusers by Facebook without the users’ knowledge or consent, and which Facebook then uses to \n22 \ndetermine or perceive to be a person’s sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, marital \n23 \nstatus, citizenship, primary language, and/or immigration status or other characteristics or affinities \n24 \nbased on the users’ Facebook page, users’ activity on Facebook and other Facebook owned websites \n25 \nor apps, and countless terabytes of data about its users that Facebook purchases or acquires by other \n26 \nmeans from various data mining firms and other sources.  \n27 \n \n28 \n10   \n                \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCase No. 3:18-cv-04529-LB \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-04529-LB   Document 26   Filed 11/19/18   Page 11 of 35\n \n \n1  22.  Based on a  Facebook user’s personal characteristics, a user’s perceived personal \n2  characteristics, their affinity groups, and/or information Facebook has obtained about its users through \n3  data and information Facebook has obtained from various data miners, Facebook builds a profile or a \n4  perceived profile of that user that is then utilized and accessed by the Ad Platform to determine what \n5  users will not receive the information or content published or provided in certain ads. \n6  23.  Affinity groups act as a thinly veiled proxy for, or a perception of, users’ personal \n7  characteristics as a hidden means to determine who does not receive ads based on characteristics \n8  protected from discrimination by Civil Code sections 51 and 51.5. Many of these affinity groups are \n9  specifically classified as “demographics” by Facebook and designed to mask Facebook’s tracking of \n10  protected  groupings  such  as  “African  American  (US),”  “Hispanic  (US  –  English  Dominant),” \n11  “Hispanic (US – Spanish Dominant),” “Asian American (US),” “Christians,” and “Moms” in order to \n12  enable defendants to not publish, not provide, and not send certain ads and the information in those \n13  ads to the Facebook  users who have been stereotyped by Facebook into these groupings. \n14   \n15  FACEBOOK’S AD PLATFORM’S MULTICULTURAL AFFINITY TOOL ENABLES \nILLEGAL DISCRIMINATION \n16 \n24.  Facebook’s Ad Platform’s Multicultural Affinity tool and its Exclude People and \n17 \nInclude People features has allowed advertisers to hide and conceal their illegal discrimination in at \n18 \nleast two steps. \n19 \n25.  First, Facebook’s Ad Platform’s Multicultural Affinity tool aids, allows, and enables \n20 \nadvertisers, including Facebook itself as an advertiser, to discriminate against specific groups of users \n21 \nby  not  publishing,  providing,  or  sending  ads  to  certain  users  for  products,  accommodations, \n22 \nadvantages, facilities, privileges, housing, or services. (See Figure 1 below.) This can be done by \n23 \n“demographic,” “interest,” or “behavior.” For example, the Ad Platform allows targeting of an ad to \n24 \nthe demographic “Renters.” or to users who have expressed an interest in or like pages related to \n25 \n“Buying a House.” \n26 \n \n27 \n \n28 \n11   \n                \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCase No. 3:18-cv-04529-LB \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-04529-LB   Document 26   Filed 11/19/18   Page 12 of 35\n \n \n1  Figure 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n   \n17 \nScreen shot from the article by ProPublica entitled “Facebook Lets Advertisers \nExclude Users By Race,” available at https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-\n18 \nlets-advertisers-exclude-users-by-race, which shows options from the Facebook Ad \n19  Platform’s drop-down menus. \n \n20 \n26.  Second, the Ad Platform’s Multicultural Affinity tool has affirmatively induced, aided, \n21 \nallowed, and enabled advertisers, including Facebook, to click a button labeled “Exclude People” to \n22 \nprevent the information or content in an ad from being published, provided, or sent to users based on \n23 \ncertain  personal  characteristics  or  certain  perceived  personal  characteristics,  such  as  “African \n24 \nAmerican” or “Hispanic as seen in Figure 1 above), or as “Hispanic (US – Bilingual)” or “Hispanic \n25 \n(US – Spanish dominant)” as seen in Table 2 below. Facebook’s Advertiser Help Center has explained \n26 \nthat the platform “offers advanced features like the ability to exclude certain characteristics from your \n27 \ntarget audience.” These characteristics include those listed in Civil Code sections 51 and 51.5. \n28 \n  12   \n                \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCase No. 3:18-cv-04529-LB \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-04529-LB   Document 26   Filed 11/19/18   Page 13 of 35\n \n \n1  27.  Among the “characteristics” or perceived characteristics that can be excluded are \n2  “African American (US),” “Asian American (US),” and categories of “Hispanic (US),” the latter \n3  broken  down  into  subcategories  based  on  the  users’  primary  language  –  “bilingual,”  “English \n4  dominant,”  or  “Spanish  dominant.”  Facebook’s  Multicultural  Affinity  feature  has  affirmatively \n5  induced advertisers to exclude users based on marital status, by affirmatively inducing advertisers to \n6  exclude users such as those who are “Divorced.” It has affirmatively induced advertisers to exclude \n7  advertisers based on sex by affirmatively inducing advertisers to exclude “Moms.” It has affirmatively \n8  induced advertisers to exclude users based on religion by excluding users who are “Christian, \n9  “Muslim,” “Jewish Culture,” or “Jews for Judaism.” And the Ad Platform has affirmatively induce \n10  advertisers to exclude based on national origin, citizenship, or immigration status by affirmatively \n11  inducing advertisers to exclude users based on “Expat (All),” which is defined by Facebook as “People \n12  whose original country of residence is different from the current country/countries selected above.” \n13  28.  Interestingly, Facebook, whose CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg are \n14  both Caucasians, has not created or developed a feature on it Ad Platform to affirmatively induce \n15  advertisers to exclude the demographic or perceived demographic of Whites or Caucasians from being \n16  provided or sent ads. \n17  29.  Table 1, below, is a non-exclusive list of the characteristics that are not specifically \n18  enumerated in Civil Code sections 51 and 51.5 but are on Facebook’s Ad Platform and can be targeted \n19  to tailor an advertisement for housing. \n20  Table 1: Characteristics That Can Be Targeted In Ads to be Tailored to Housing  \nRenters  \n21 \nFirst time homebuyer  \n22  Likely to move  \nApartment finder  \n23  New mover  \n$8,000 Home Buyer Tax Credit  \n24 \n \n25  30.  On the other hand, Table 2 below is a non-exclusive list of the personal characteristics \n26  that are listed in Civil Code sections 51 and 51.5 and that have been able to be excluded under the Ad \n27  Platform, thereby preventing information in certain ads from being published, provided or sent to \n28  certain uses based on personal characteristics protected by Civil Code sections 51 and 51.5.  \n13   \n                \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCase No. 3:18-cv-04529-LB \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-04529-LB   Document 26   Filed 11/19/18   Page 14 of 35\n \n \n1  Table 2: Characteristics That Can Be Excluded, Allowing Discrimination Against the \nProtected Categories of Race, Color, Religion, Sex, Marital Status, National Origin, \n2 \nCitizenship, Primary Language, and Immigration Status \n \n3 \nRace/Color/  Sex   Marital Status   Religion   National Origin/ \n4  Primary  Citizenship/Im-\nLanguage   migration Status  \n5 \nAfrican American  Working Women   Family-based  Christian   Expats (All)3  \n(US)   Households  \n6 \nAsian American  Moms   New parents   Christianity   Non-resident \n7  (US)   Indian and person \nof Indian origin  \n8 \nHispanic (US -  Big-city moms   Housemate-based  Catholicism   Immigrant  \n9  All)   Households  \nHispanic (US -  Corporate moms   Civil Union   Mainline  Expats (Mexico)4  \n10  Bilingual)   Protestant  \nHispanic (US -  Fit moms   Divorced   Jewish culture   Expats (Pakistan)  \n11 \nEnglish \n12  dominant)  \nHispanic (US -  Green moms   Domestic  Jews for Judaism   Expats \n13  Spanish  Partnership   (Philippines)  \ndominant)  \n14 \nAfrican-American  Moms of grade  Engaged   Islam   Expats \n15  hair   school kids   (Indonesia)  \nAfrican-American  Moms of high  Married   Sunni Islam   Expats (India)  \n16 \nConservatives   school kids  \nAfrican-American  Moms of  Single   Shia Islam   Expats (Ghana)  \n17 \nConservatives   preschool kids  \n18  Indigenous  New Moms   Widowed   Hinduism   Expats (Japan)  \npeoples  \n19 \nBeing Latino   Soccer moms   Parents   Buddhism   Expats \n(Dominican \n20 \nRepublic)  \n21  Being Indian   Stay-at-home  Expectant parents   Shinto   Expats (Senegal)  \nmoms  \n22 \n \n23 \n31.

On Facebook’s Ad Platform, any ad that is seen by a user must first go through two \n4  phases: targeting and delivery. During the ad targeting phase, Facebook helps the advertiser create a \n5  “target audience”: a list of users who are eligible, but not guaranteed, to see a given ad. Because target \n6  audiences can be quite large, numbering in the hundreds of thousands or millions, it is often the case \n7  that not all of these users will actually see the ad. \n8  33.  During the ad delivery phase, Facebook itself makes decisions, independently of the \n9  advertiser, about which users within an ad’s target audience will actually see the ad. The users to \n10  whom Facebook chooses to show an ad can be said to constitute that ad’s “actual audience.” Facebook \n11  makes these delivery decisions based on its own predictions about what kinds of users are most likely \n12  to engage with that ad. Advertisers have no meaningful control over Facebook’s delivery decisions. \n13  Facebook delivers, channels, and executes the advertisements. \n14  34.  By creating Lookalike Audiences for advertisers based on its users’ protected class \n15  status, Facebook develops content that materially contributes to violations of Civil Code sections 51 \n16  and 51.5. A Lookalike Audience is a target audience, created by Facebook, that “looks like” a group \n17  of people indicated by the advertiser. To create a Lookalike Audience, Facebook starts by soliciting \n18  from an advertiser a “source audience,” such as a list of phone numbers or e-mail addresses. Once it \n19  has this list, Facebook takes several steps to create a new, custom-built target audience (the “Lookalike \n20  Audience”) for the advertiser. First, Facebook locates user accounts that match the phone numbers, \n21  email addresses, or other identifiers in the advertiser-provided source audience. Second, Facebook \n22  uses proprietary algorithms to extract “common qualities” of those users based on their demographics, \n23  interests, behavior on Facebook, and other personal information. Almost all of this data is unavailable \n24  to the advertiser. Finally, Facebook creates a targeting list comprised of new users, who were not \n25  included in the source audience but who share common qualities found in the source audience. \n26  Facebook describes this new target audience as comprising people who “are similar to (or ‘look like’)” \n27  people in the source audience. \n28   \n15   \n                \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCase No. 3:18-cv-04529-LB \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-04529-LB   Document 26   Filed 11/19/18   Page 16 of 35\n \n \n1  35.  When  creating  Lookalike  Audiences,  Facebook  reproduces  protected  class \n2  characteristics of the source audience — including gender, age, and ethnicity — by creating target \n3  audiences with similar demographics. This demographic reflection can happen regardless of whether \n4  details about protected class features like race are overtly specified by users anywhere on Facebook. \n5  Facebook’s extensive data about its users includes strong proxies for protected class membership, and \n6  these proxies can lead to a Lookalike Audience whose protected status traits match those of the source \n7  audience. \n8  36.  An illustrative example: From a small source audience of 100 mostly white parents, \n9  Facebook could create a Lookalike Audience of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people — \n10  most of whom are white parents. The advertiser might, or might not, have intended for Facebook to \n11  find white parents. In any case, Facebook tells advertisers very little about how it creates Lookalike \n12  Audiences, and almost nothing about their demographic composition. Facebook does not appear to \n13  warn advertisers that the audiences it creates might be biased, or to provide reasonable ways for \n14  advertisers to identify such bias before running their ads. This is just one way that Facebook has \n15  created or developed content that contributes to the illegality of its Ad Platform. \n16  37.  By creating Lookalike Audiences in this way, Facebook has created or developed \n17  content. Moreover, the target audiences that Facebook creates exert control over which users are \n18  eligible to see an ad and which users are entirely excluded by omission. When target audiences exclude \n19  users along protected class lines, those audiences materially contribute to illegality under Civil Code \n20  sections 51 and 51.5. \n21  38.  Facebook’s Lookalike Audience product is not a neutral tool.” Lookalike Audiences \n22  are simply not analogous to rudimentary dropdown menus or keyword suggestions. Instead, the \n23  Lookalike Audiences that Facebook creates for advertisers are unique, distinct, powerful, and legally \n24  salient pieces of content. The Lookalike Audience creation process, and indeed the final audience \n25  itself, are both thoroughly opaque to the advertiser, depriving the advertiser of opportunity to exercise \n26  its own judgment and discretion over that content. \n27  39.  In  sum,  Lookalike  Audiences  are  created  by  Facebook,  not  by  the  advertiser. \n28  Advertisers do not know — because Facebook does not tell them — who is in a Lookalike Audience. \n16   \n                \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCase No. 3:18-cv-04529-LB \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-04529-LB   Document 26   Filed 11/19/18   Page 17 of 35\n \n \n1  Facebook chooses each member of the Lookalike Audience, reaching beyond the source audience that \n2  the advertiser already knows. Wherever such an audience happens to be racially exclusionary or \n3  otherwise discriminatory on protected status grounds, it is Facebook — not the advertiser — that \n4  compiles the exclusionary target audience.  \n5  40.  By making decisions about the delivery of advertisements based on its users’ protected \n6  class status, Facebook exposes itself to claims under Civil Code sections 51 and 51.5. Once the \n7  targeting phase is complete, Facebook decides which users within a target audience will see a given \n8  ad. To deliver ads, Facebook conducts billions of automated analyses every day – one each time an ad \n9  is displayed – instantaneously filling available ad space as users scroll through its site. \n10  41.  These analyses are  referred to  as “auctions,” but  the mathematics and judgment \n11  Facebook uses are in fact far more complex and opaque than a standard “highest bidder” auction. \n12  These auctions determine which ad is shown to a particular user, among all of the ads that the user is \n13  eligible to receive by virtue of their inclusion in those ads’ target audiences.  \n14  42.  Facebook does not determine the outcomes of these auctions neutrally, strictly on price. \n15  Rather, Facebook seeks to “match the right ad to the right person at the right time” by making its own \n16  predictions about which ads the user is most likely to interact with, the perceived “quality” of the ad, \n17  and other factors These predictions are based on Facebook’s own knowledge about that user’s \n18  characteristics and past behavior, the behavior of similar users, and whether similar users have \n19  interacted with the ads competing in that auction. Like Lookalike Audiences, these predictions can \n20  favor or disfavor users based on their protected class status. \n21  If Facebook detects a pattern of men interacting with a particular ad, it will automatically and without \n22  instruction from or notification to the advertiser steer that ad toward other men in the future. In sum, \n23  Facebook itself decides which users within a target audience will (and will not) see a particular ad. \n24  And by its own description, Facebook’s  ad delivery decisions can operate based on protected \n25  characteristics. Facebook steers ads away from protected groups. Facebook is inextricably involved \n26  with who does and who does not see ads and the information or content in those ads that are placed \n27  on its platform. \n28   \n17   \n                \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCase No. 3:18-cv-04529-LB \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-04529-LB   Document 26   Filed 11/19/18   Page 18 of 35\n \n \n1  43.  Facebook, through the operation of its ad delivery system, independently directs ads \n2  based on its users’ personal characteristics protected by Civil Code sections 51 and 51.5. Facebook’s \n3  users, in the normal course of using Facebook’s services, cannot help but reveal to  Facebook \n4  preferences and personal characteristics that enable this discrimination to occur. As a result, Facebook \n5  has created and developed content that contributes materially to Facebook violating Civil Code \n6  sections 51 and 51.5. \n7  44.  As an example of Facebook’s proactive involvement in Facebook’s Ad Platform and \n8  its Multicultural Affinity tool, Facebook has employed sales and customer support representatives who \n9  work one-on-one with Facebook’s advertisers to ensure advertisers reap the maximum benefits of \n10  Facebook’s Ad Platform and its Multicultural Affinity tool. \n11  45.  Facebook  has  publicly  committed  to  removing  “an  ad  from  our  platform  if  the \n12  government agency responsible for enforcing discrimination laws tells us that the ad reflects illegal \n13  discrimination.” But no user can tell whether they are subject to illegal discrimination, because the \n14  discrimination occurs with the ads Facebook users are not sent and therefore do not see or hear. As a \n15  result, the problem will not be remedied unless and until Facebook and its advertisers’ clandestine \n16  intentional discrimination is exposed and the court orders defendants to put an end to this chronic and \n17  widespread unlawful discrimination. \n18  46.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs bring their claims under California Civil Code sections 51 and \n19  51.5 against Facebook and its advertisers who have ever engaged in the unlawful and morally offensive \n20  conduct of creating, developing, or using the Multicultural Affinity tool to exclude Facebook users \n21  from being sent any ads and the information or content in those ads based on the users’ sex, race, color, \n22  religion, ancestry, national origin, marital status, citizenship, primary language, immigration status, \n23  age, or those characteristics added by the courts. \n24  NATURE AND BASIS OF CLAIMS SPECIFICALLY  \nCONCERNING ADVERTISEMENTS FOR JOB OPPORTUNITIES \n25 \n47.

Upon information and belief, prior to December 2017, job advertising campaigns that \n11  Facebook, T-Mobile, Amazon, Cox, and other advertiser defendants were running and sending via \n12  Facebook were age-restricted and set an upper age limit on which Facebook users would receive the \n13  job advertisements that excluded older people. \n14  49.  Upon information and belief, Facebook, T-Mobile, Amazon, Cox, and other advertiser \n15  defendants each sent age-restricted job advertisements and notices to Facebook users who resided, \n16  were located, and/or were searching for employment throughout the United States, including in \n17  California, the District of Columbia, Ohio, and Maryland. \n18  50.  Upon information and belief, Facebook, T-Mobile, Amazon, Cox, and other advertiser \n19  defendants each directed, requested, approved of, and/or authorized Facebook, its agent, to exclude \n20  persons above certain ages from receiving their job advertisements or notices that were sent throughout \n21  the United States regarding job opportunities throughout the United States, including California, and \n22  directed, requested, approved of, and/or authorized Facebook to include as a portion of the job \n23  advertisements or notices a statement that the advertiser “wants to reach people” between certain \n24  “ages”; and Facebook, the agent of T-Mobile, Amazon, Cox, and other advertiser defendants, executed \n25  these directions and requests, thereby excluding older workers from receiving the job advertisements \n26  or notices of Facebook, T-Mobile, Amazon, Cox, and other advertiser defendants, and stating that \n27  these advertisers “want[] to reach people” between certain “ages.” \n28   \n20   \n                \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCase No. 3:18-cv-04529-LB \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-04529-LB   Document 26   Filed 11/19/18   Page 21 of 35\n \n \n1  51.  Upon information and belief, the age-restricted advertisements that Facebook, T-\n2  Mobile, Amazon, Cox, and other advertiser defendants purchased, directed, approved of, authorized, \n3  and sent advertised jobs and provided information to Facebook users who received the ads about jobs \n4  that were located throughout the states where these advertisers hire workers, including jobs in \n5  California, the District of Columbia, and Ohio. Accordingly, upon information and belief, all of the \n6  job advertisements that Facebook, T-Mobile, Amazon, Cox, and other advertiser defendants sent to \n7  Facebook users directed the Facebook users to information about their jobs in California and all of the \n8  other states in which these advertisers hire people. \n9  52.  Advertiser defendants, including Facebook, T-Mobile, Amazon, and Cox, purchased, \n10  developed, created, and sent their age-restricted job advertisements in and from Facebook’s ad \n11  platform and business that is located in California. \n12  53.  Advertiser defendants, including Facebook, T-Mobile, Amazon, and Cox, did not send \n13  job advertisements via Facebook that targeted older workers, and thus in this critical medium of \n14  Facebook job advertising and recruiting the advertiser defendants only targeted younger workers \n15  without similarly targeting older workers to receive their job advertisements, and nor did they use \n16  other forms of social media to disproportionately target older workers with job advertisements to offset \n17  the harm of excluding older workers from receiving their job advertisements via Facebook. \n18  PARTIES \n19  54.  At all times relevant hereto, Plaintiff Bert Riddick was an African-American California \n20  resident and a Facebook user. He has been harmed by being prevented from hearing or seeing ads on \n21  his Facebook page because Facebook’s  Multicultural Affinity tool prevented ads for Facebook \n22  advertisers’ products, accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, employment opportunities, \n23  housing  or  services—including,  but  not  limited  to  employment  opportunities,  housing,  sales, \n24  discounts, coupons, limited quantities, free shipping, and other special offers, and/or promotions—\n25  from being sent to Mr. Riddick’s Facebook page based on his personal characteristics protected by \n26  Civil Code sections 51 and 51.5, or defendants’ perception that Mr. Riddick bore any of these personal \n27  characteristics. Mr. Riddick is an IT professional often interested in career opportunities and therefore \n28  was harmed by Facebook and other advertisers not sending him ads including, but not limited to, job \n21   \n                \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCase No. 3:18-cv-04529-LB \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-04529-LB   Document 26   Filed 11/19/18   Page 22 of 35\n \n \n1  opportunities in the IT field because of his age, which was over 55 at the time the original Complaint \n2  was filed. \n3  55.  At all times relevant hereto, Plaintiff Allan Candelore was a Hispanic California \n4  resident and a Facebook user. He has been harmed by being prevented from hearing, seeing, or \n5  otherwise perceiving advertisements on his Facebook page because Facebook’s Multicultural Affinity \n6  tool  prevented  ads  for  Facebook  advertisers’  products,  accommodations,  advantages,  facilities, \n7  privileges, employment opportunities, housing, or services—including, but not limited to employment \n8  opportunities, housing, sales, discounts, coupons, limited quantities, free shipping, and other special \n9  offers, and/or promotions—from being sent to Mr. Candelore’s Facebook page based on his based on \n10  his personal characteristics protected by Civil Code sections 51 and 51.5, or defendants’ perception \n11  that Mr. Candelore bore any of these personal characteristics.  Mr. Candelore is a residential property \n12  manager among other jobs, and is often interested in information, including advertisements, about \n13  career opportunities and about housing, and therefore Mr. Candelore was harmed by Facebook and \n14  other advertisers not sending him ads about housing and other products and services. \n15  56.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that Defendant Facebook, \n16  Inc. is an American corporation, headquartered in Menlo Park, California, incorporated under the laws \n17  of the State of Delaware, registered with the California Secretary of State as a corporation with Entity \n18  Number C2711108, and with a California registered agent for service of process. Facebook owns and \n19  operates an online social networking website that allows its users to communicate with each other \n20  through the sharing of at least text, photographs, and videos. Part of Facebook’s website is an Ad \n21  Platform Multicultural Affinity tool that has affirmatively induced its advertisers to express illegal \n22  preferences of Facebook users based on the users’ personal characteristics or perceived personal \n23  characteristics – all of which are protected by Civil Code sections 51 and 51.5, thereby making \n24  Facebook a creator and/or developer of the information or content in the ads that are not published, \n25  not provided, and not sent to Facebook users based on the users’ genuine or perceived protected \n26  personal characteristics. \n27  57.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that defendant T-Mobile \n28  US, is one of the largest wireless companies in the United States.

The company calls itself the “Un – carrier” \n5  that is “Un – satisfy with the status quo” and “Un-afraid to innovate.” T-Mobile operates various \n6  brands of its wireless communication services, including T-Mobile and Metro PCS, through is owned \n7  and operated stores, third-party distributors, and websites. T-Mobile nationally advertises employment \n8  opportunities at its stores and other operations that are located in California, and throughout the nation, \n9  both for the T-Mobile and MetroPCS brands. T-Mobile recently has been advertising jobs in 42 states, \n10  including California, and the District of Columbia. Upon information and belief, T-Mobile has \n11  regularly used Facebook’s ad platform to send employment advertisements to prospective applicants \n12  for a range of positions in its T-Mobile and MetroPCS divisions, including jobs in its retail stores and \n13  beyond; and in doing so, T-Mobile has restricted the age range of the population that T-Mobile \n14  intended to receive its employment ads to focus on young workers and exclude older workers. \n15  58.  Plaintiffs  are  informed  and  believe,  and  on  that  basis  allege,  that  defendant \n16  Amazon.com, Inc., is one of the largest online retailers in the world, is a Delaware corporation with \n17  its headquarters in Seattle, Washington. Amazon sells hundreds of millions of products to American \n18  consumers, and employed 341,400 full-time and part-time employees as of December 31, 2016. In \n19  2016,  Amazon  had  $135.9  billion  in  revenues.  Amazon  nationally  advertises  employment \n20  opportunities as locations in California, and throughout the United States. Upon information and \n21  belief, Amazon has regularly used Facebook’s ad platform to send employment advertisements to \n22  prospective applicants for a range of positions at Amazon in California, and throughout the United \n23  States; and in doing so Amazon has restricted the age range of the population that Amazon intended \n24  to receive its employment ads to focus on younger workers and exclude older workers. \n25  59.   Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that defendant Cox \n26  Communications, Inc. is a broadband communications and entertainment company that provides \n27  digital video, telephone, internet, and home security and automation services through its nationwide \n28  network.

It owns and operates 14 television stations, more than 60 radio stations, six newspapers, and \n5  over 100 digital services. Cox Communications, Inc. and Cox Media Group, LLC are both subsidiaries \n6  of Cox Enterprises, Inc., a privately held media company that had more than 20 billion in revenues \n7  and 60,000 employees in 2016. Upon information and belief, Cox Communications, Inc. and Cox \n8  Media Group, LLC have regularly used Facebook’s ad platform to send employment advertisements \n9  to prospective applicants for a range of positions at each respective company in California, and \n10  throughout the United States, and in doing so have restricted the age range of the population that they \n11  intended to receive their employment ads to focus on younger workers and exclude older workers. \n12  Upon information and belief, Cox Communications, Inc. and Cox Media Group, LLC share marketing \n13  and recruitment personnel and resources to create and send employment advertisements via Facebook. \n14  60.  The true names and capacities of Does 1 through 5,000 are unknown to Plaintiffs and \n15  include advertisers who have ever used Facebook’s Multicultural Affinity, Exclude People, and/or \n16  Include People tools at any time within the statutes of limitation to prevent ads and the information or \n17  content in those ads from being published, provided, or sent to Facebook users based on users’ personal \n18  characteristics protected by California Civil Code sections 51 and 51.5. When the Does’ true names \n19  and capacities are learned, Plaintiffs will amend this complaint accordingly. Plaintiffs allege that the \n20  wrongful acts alleged herein have been committed by defendants and each of them such that each \n21  fictitiously named defendant has unequally treated or discriminated against Facebook users based on \n22  the users’ sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, marital status, citizenship, primary \n23  language, or immigration status.

Furthermore, Facebook has consented to this Court having \n3  subject matter jurisdiction of all of the claims in this action by having removed the Second Amended \n4  Complaint and its causes of action, which remain the same in this Third Amended Complaint, to this \n5  Court. \n6  62.  This Court has personal jurisdiction over Facebook. There is general jurisdiction over \n7  Facebook because Facebook’s corporate headquarters are located in this District in Menlo Park, \n8  California, Facebook conducts  substantial  business  throughout  this District  and in  the State of \n9  California, and Facebook employs thousands of workers in the California. Facebook has consented to \n10  this Court asserting personal jurisdiction over Facebook, based on (1) Facebook’s Statement of Rights \n11  and Responsibilities requires its users to resolve any disputes in the Northern District of California or \n12  a state court located in San Mateo County and requires its users to “submit to the personal jurisdiction \n13  of such courts for the purpose of litigating all such claims,” and (2) Facebook having removed this \n14  case from the San Mateo County Superior Court to this Court. \n15  63.  This  Court  has  personal  jurisdiction  over  defendants  T-Mobile,  Amazon,  Cox \n16  Communications,  and  Cox  Media  Group,  because  upon  information  and  belief,  they  conduct \n17  substantial business throughout this District, employ a substantial number of workers in this District, \n18  created and purchased discriminatory ads in this District via Facebook’s ad platform that is located in \n19  this District, sent such discriminatory ads from this District to Facebook users located in this District \n20  and throughout the United States, while they also did not send such ads from this District to Facebook \n21  users located in this District and throughout the United States based on users’ personal characteristics \n22  protected by Civil Code sections 51 and 51.5, including for positions within this District. Defendants \n23  have conducted and continue to conduct substantial business throughout California to render the \n24  exercise of personal jurisdiction over them by California courts consistent with traditional notions of \n25  fair play and substantial justice. \n26  64.  Declaratory and injunctive relief is sought and authorized by 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and \n27  2202. \n28 \n25   \n                \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCase No. 3:18-cv-04529-LB \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-04529-LB   Document 26   Filed 11/19/18   Page 26 of 35\n \n \n1  65.  Venue is proper is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1), as upon \n2  information and belief, a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to Plaintiffs’ claims \n3  occurred in this District, where all defendants created, developed and/or purchased discriminatory ads via \n4  Facebook’s ad platform that is located in this District, sent such discriminatory ads from this District to \n5  Facebook users located in this District and throughout the United States, while defendants also did not \n6  send such ads from this District to Facebook users located in this District and throughout the United \n7  States based on users’ personal characteristics protected by Civil Code sections 51 and 51.5.    \n8  CLASS ALLEGATIONS \n9  66.  Plaintiffs bring this class action on their own behalf and on behalf of all other persons \n10  similarly situated, defined as follows:  \n11  All Facebook users at any time within the three years before the original \nComplaint in this action was filed, and continuing through the date of trial, who \n12 \nwere not sent an advertisement to the users’ Facebook page for products, \n13  accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, employment opportunities, \nhousing,  or  services  because  Facebook  advertisers  and  Facebook  used \n14 \nFacebook’s Multicultural Affinity, Exclude People, or Include People tool to \n15 \nexclude Facebook users from being sent ads and the information or contact in \n16  those ads based on the users’ sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, \nmarital status, citizenship, primary language, immigration status, age, or those \n17 \ncharacteristics added by the courts to those characteristics protected by Civil \n18  Code sections 51 and 51.5 (the “Class”). \n \n19 \n67.  Not included in the Class are the following individuals and/or entities: Facebook and \n20 \nits parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers and directors, current or former employees, and any entity \n21 \nin which Facebook has a controlling interest; all individuals who make a timely election to be excluded \n22 \nfrom this proceeding using the correct protocol for opting out; all judges and their staff members \n23 \nassigned to hear any aspect of this litigation, as well as such judges’ immediate family members; and \n24 \nPlaintiffs’ counsel and anyone employed by Plaintiffs’ counsel. \n25 \n68.  Plaintiffs reserve the right to modify or amend the definition of the proposed Class \n26 \nbefore the Court determines whether certification is appropriate. \n27 \n28 \n26   \n                \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCase No. 3:18-cv-04529-LB \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-04529-LB   Document 26   Filed 11/19/18   Page 27 of 35\n \n \n1  69.  This action has been brought and may properly be maintained pursuant to Federal Rules \n2  of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b)(2) and (b)(3) because: \n3  (a)  The Class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. Upon \n4  information  and  belief,  there  are  approximately  2  billion  Facebook  users \n5  worldwide and approximately160 million Facebook users in the United States. \n6  The  number  of  individuals  who  are  members  of  a  protected  class  under \n7  California Civil Code sections 51 and 51.5 and who were registered with \n8  Facebook as Facebook users within three years before the filing of the original \n9  Complaint in this action is likely to be in tens or hundreds of millions and are \n10  readily identifiable and ascertainable through Facebook’s records for Facebook \n11  users. \n12  (b)  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the proposed \n13  Class.  These  questions  predominate  over  any  questions  that  affect  only \n14  individual members of the proposed Class. These common legal and factual \n15  questions include: \n16  (1)  Whether defendants have created, developed, and/or utilized \n17  Facebook’s Multicultural Affinity, Exclude People, or Include \n18  People advertising tools, or collaborated with each other to \n19  create and develop information and content via the Multicultural \n20  Affinity  tool  with  respect  to  the  sale  of  products, \n21  accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, housing, or \n22  services, and/or with respect to recruiting and/or advertising for \n23  employees  which  has  unequally  treated  and  discriminated \n24  against Facebook users based on the users’ age, sex, race, color, \n25  religion, ancestry, national origin, marital status, citizenship, \n26  primary language, immigration status, age, or other personal \n27  characteristics protected by Civil Code sections 51 or 51.5;  \n28 \n27   \n                \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCase No. 3:18-cv-04529-LB \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-04529-LB   Document 26   Filed 11/19/18   Page 28 of 35\n \n \n1  (2)  Whether defendants violated the Unruh Civil Rights Act (Civil \n2  Code section 51); \n3  (3)  Whether defendants violated Civil Code section 51.5; and \n4  (4)  The  amount  of  statutory  damages  mandated  by  Civil  Code \n5  section 52 that should be levied against defendants. \n6  70.  Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the Class in that Plaintiffs and the Class \n7  have been Facebook users during the class period. Each of the Class members was not provided or \n8  sent ads on their Facebook page as a result of the choices advertisers made through the Ad Platform \n9  and its Multicultural Affinity, Exclude People, and/or Include People tools. Defendants further used \n10  or endeavored to use the contents of Plaintiffs’ and Class members’ Facebook profile information, \n11  Facebook activity, other Facebook websites or apps, and data about Plaintiffs and Class members that \n12  Facebook obtained from data mining firms, to generate stereotypes about Facebook users to lump \n13  Plaintiffs and Class members within particular groups based on personal characteristics or perceived \n14  personal characteristics that are protected by Civil Code sections 51 and 51.5. Plaintiffs and Class \n15  members are entitled to statutory damages and injunctive relief as a result of the conduct complained \n16  of herein. Moreover, upon information and belief, the conduct complained of herein is unlawful, \n17  morally offensive, systemic, and very profitable for  defendants. As a result, the representative \n18  Plaintiffs, like all other Class members, face substantial risk of the same injury in the future. The \n19  factual basis of defendants’ conduct is common to all Class members and represents a common thread \n20  of conduct resulting in injury to all members of the Class. \n21  71.  Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the members of the Class.  \n22  They are members of the proposed Class and have no interests adverse to the interests of the Class.  \n23  They are champions of equal rights for everyone and are interested in and seek equal treatment for \n24  everyone, no matter their sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, marital status, citizenship, \n25  primary language, immigration status, or age. Plaintiffs have been treated unequally because of \n26  defendants’ conduct. This unequal treatment of Plaintiffs provides them with a substantial stake in this \n27  action and the incentive to prosecute it vigorously for themselves and for the Class.   \n28 \n28   \n                \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCase No. 3:18-cv-04529-LB \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-04529-LB   Document 26   Filed 11/19/18   Page 29 of 35\n \n \n1  72.  Plaintiffs have retained competent counsel who is experienced in prosecuting hundreds \n2  of Unruh Civil Rights Act claims for the unequal treatment of consumers by businesses based on \n3  consumers’ personal characteristics protected by Civil Code sections 51 and 51.5, who is familiar with \n4  class actions, and who intends to pursue this action vigorously. Plaintiffs’ counsel represented the \n5  prevailing plaintiffs/appellants at the California Supreme Court in the landmark Unruh Civil Rights \n6  Act case of Angelucci v. Century Supper Club (2007) 41 Cal.4th 160. Angelucci held that African-\n7  Americans,  Hispanics,  women,  Christians,  Jews,  Muslims,  gays,  lesbians,  and  other  groups \n8  discriminated  against  by  businesses  do  not  have  to  confront  a  discriminating  business  and \n9  affirmatively assert their right to equal treatment in order to have standing to file an Unruh Act claim. \n10  73.  The Judicial Council regularly asks for Plaintiffs’ counsel’s advice when the Judicial \n11  Council considers amending the CACI jury instructions relating to Civil Code sections 51, 51.5, 51.6, \n12  or 52, and the Judicial Council has incorporated several of Plaintiffs’ counsel’s suggested amendments \n13  into its revised jury instructions for these statutes. \n14  74.  Plaintiffs’ counsel has voluntarily consulted for the State Bar of California several \n15  times to change the Bar’s existing or planned discriminatory policies or practices. In 2013, Plaintiffs’ \n16  counsel convinced the State Bar to amend the application requirements for the Bar Foundation’s \n17  Diversity Scholarship so that now all law school students, no matter their race, color, or national origin, \n18  are eligible for the Bar Foundation’s Diversity Scholarships. That same year, Plaintiffs’ counsel again \n19  voluntarily consulted with the Bar and convinced the Bar, which was concerned about the mental \n20  acuity of older members, to scrap its misguided plan to require members of the State Bar of California \n21  who were 50 years of age and older, lawyers and judges alike, to (1) pass continuing education courses, \n22  (2) pass assessment tests, (3) take classes on how to wind down or pass on their law practice, and (4) \n23  undergo peer counseling, presumably from a peer who already passed the above age-based courses, \n24  tests, and classes. \n25  75.  Plaintiffs’  counsel  is  currently  representing  Plaintiff  Allan  Candelore  for  Mr. \n26  Candelore’s Unruh Civil Rights Act age discrimination class action lawsuit against the popular \n27  matchmaking app Tinder for its eponymously named Tinder Plus premium service that has charged \n28  consumers 30 years of age and older twice as much as consumers under 30 - $19.99/month vs. \n29   \n                \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCase No. 3:18-cv-04529-LB \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-04529-LB   Document 26   Filed 11/19/18   Page 30 of 35\n \n \n1  $9.99/month – for the exact same matchmaking service. The Los Angeles County Superior Court \n2  dismissed Mr. Candelore’s lawsuit in late 2015 after sustaining Tinder’s demurrer by unwisely ruling \n3  that the Unruh Civil Rights Act does not protect people from age discrimination. But on January 29, \n4  2018, in the published opinion of Allan Candelore v. Tinder, Inc. (2018) 19 Cal.App.5th 1138, the \n5  Court of Appeal righted that wrong by reversing the trial court and ruling that the Unruh Civil Rights \n6  Act does indeed prohibit businesses from discriminating against individuals based on their age.  \n7  76.  Plaintiffs  assert  that  questions  of  law  or  fact  common  to  the  Class  Members \n8  predominate over any questions affecting only individual members. \n9  77.  A  class  action  is  superior  to  other  available  methods  for  the  fair  and  efficient \n10  adjudication of this controversy. Most members of the Class were not even aware, and still are not \n11  aware, that they were being discriminated against because of the hidden nature of the discriminatory \n12  aspects of the Ad Platform and its Multicultural Affinity, Exclude People, and Include People tools \n13  utilized by defendants. That is, many members of the class did not know, and still do not know, that \n14  they were not being sent ads for job opportunities, products, accommodations, advantages, facilities, \n15  privileges, job opportunities, housing, or services because the ad buyers used the Ad Platform’s \n16  Multicultural Affinity, Exclude People, or Include People tool to exclude the Class members based on \n17  their sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, marital status, citizenship, primary language, \n18  immigration status, or age. For example, defendants did not tell or notify Class members that they \n19  were not being sent certain ads for products, accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, job \n20  opportunities, housing, or services because the ad buyers had used the Ad Platform’s Multicultural \n21  Affinity, Exclude People, or Include People tool to exclude users based on their sex, race, color, \n22  religion, ancestry, national origin, marital status, citizenship, primary language, immigration status, or \n23  age. Therefore, absent a class action, members of the Class will not even know they have legally \n24  recognizable discrimination claims against defendants. And many, probably most, members of Class \n25  to this day still do not realize that defendants did not send them ads for sales, discounts, coupons, \n26  special offers, and other promotions because defendants determined, perceived, or guessed that the \n27  Class members were a certain disfavored sex, race, religion, etc. \n28 \n30   \n                \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCase No. 3:18-cv-04529-LB \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-04529-LB   Document 26   Filed 11/19/18   Page 31 of 35\n \n \n1  78.  Even if members of the Class themselves could afford such individual litigation, the \n2  court system might not. Given the legal and factual issues involved and considering that the Class \n3  could number in the tens or hundreds of millions, individualized litigation would significantly increase \n4  the delay and expense to all parties and to the Court. Individualized litigation would also create the \n5  potential for inconsistent or contradictory rulings. By contrast, a class action presents far fewer \n6  management difficulties, allows claims to be heard which may otherwise go unheard because of the \n7  relative expense of bringing individual lawsuits, and provides the benefits of adjudication, economies \n8  of scale and comprehensive supervision by a single court. \n9  79.  Defendants have acted in ways generally applicable to the Class, thereby making \n10  appropriate final and injunctive relief regarding members of the Class as a whole. \n11  80.  The names and addresses of the putative class members are available from and can be \n12  ascertained by Facebook. To the extent required by law, notice will be provided to the prospective \n13  class members easily, effectively, and efficiently via Facebook electronically sending notice to its \n14  users, or by use of techniques in a form of notice that has been used customarily in class actions, \n15  subject to court approval, such as by first-class mail. \n16  81.  Defendants’ conduct as described above is unlawful, is capable of repetition, and will \n17  continue unless restrained and enjoined by the Court.  \n18   \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n19 \nViolation Of The Unruh Civil Rights Act, California Civil Code Section 51 \n20   \n82.  Plaintiffs incorporate in this cause of action the allegations contained in the preceding \n21 \nparagraphs of this Complaint as if they were set out in full herein. \n22 \n83.  Defendants are “business establishments” within the meaning of the Unruh Civil Rights \n23 \nAct. \n24 \n84.  Through defendants’ collaboration in creating, developing, and/or utilizing the Ad \n25 \nPlatform’s  Multicultural  Affinity,  Exclude  People,  and  Include  People  tools,  defendants  have \n26 \nintentionally not published, not provided, and not sent ads and the information or content in those ads \n27 \nto Plaintiffs and members of the Class for products, accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, \n28 \n31   \n                \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCase No. 3:18-cv-04529-LB \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-04529-LB   Document 26   Filed 11/19/18   Page 32 of 35\n \n \n1  job opportunities, housing, or services based on the Plaintiffs and Class members’ sex, race, color, \n2  religion, ancestry, national origin, marital status, citizenship, primary language, immigration status, \n3  age or other protected personal characteristic. Defendants, through their above conduct relating to the \n4  Ad  Platform’s  Multicultural  Affinity,  Exclude  People,  and  Include  People  tools,  have  steered \n5  advertisements away from Plaintiffs and Class members based on the Facebook users’ sex, race, color, \n6  religion, ancestry, national origin, marital status, citizenship, primary language, immigration status, \n7  age or other protected personal characteristics. \n8  85.  Facebook’s Multicultural Affinity, Exclude People, and Include People tools were used \n9  by Facebook’s advertisers and by Facebook to not publish, not provide, and not send ads and the \n10  information in those ads to Plaintiffs and members of the Class based on their protected personal \n11  characteristics. As a result, Plaintiffs and members of the Class have been harmed by not having an \n12  equal opportunity to see or hear ads for products, accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, \n13  job opportunities, housing, or services. \n14  86.  By virtue of defendants’ collaboration in creating, developing, and/or utilizing the \n15  Multicultural Affinity, Exclude People, or Include People tools, defendants intentionally denied equal \n16  accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, job opportunities, housing, or services to Plaintiffs \n17  and members of the Class on the basis of their sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, \n18  marital status, citizenship, primary language, immigration status, age or other protected personal \n19  characteristic. This intentional unequal treatment is prohibited by the Unruh Civil Rights Act, codified \n20  as Civil Code section 51. \n21  87.  Facebook,  through  its  creation,  development,  implementation,  promotion,  and \n22  marketing of its Multicultural Affinity, Exclude People, or Include People tools, and through its \n23  collaboration with its advertisers in the use of these tools, has substantially and affirmatively induced \n24  its  advertisers  to  express  illegal  preferences  of  Facebook  users  based  on  the  users’  personal \n25  characteristics or perceived personal characteristics, all of which are protected by Civil Code section \n26  51. Facebook, along with its advertisers, have been responsible, in whole or in part, for the creation or \n27  development of the offending content in the ads that are sent or not sent to Class members based on \n28  certain protected personal characteristics. Facebook’s substantial affirmative conduct in promoting its \n32   \n                \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCase No. 3:18-cv-04529-LB \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-04529-LB   Document 26   Filed 11/19/18   Page 33 of 35\n \n \n1  advertisers’ use of its Multicultural Affinity, Exclude People, or Include People tools for unlawful \n2  purposes has resulted in the unlawful discrimination of many Facebook users. \n3  88.  Pursuant to Civil Code section 52, defendants are liable to Plaintiffs and the members \n4  of the Class for the statutory damages mandated by Civil Code section 52 for each and every offense, \n5  and attorneys’ fees that may be determined by the court in addition thereto. \n6  89.  Pursuant to Civil Code section 52, injunctive relief is necessary and appropriate to \n7  prevent defendants from repeating their discriminatory actions as alleged above. Plaintiffs are entitled \n8  to injunctive relief on behalf of themselves and the Class. \n9   \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n10 \nViolation Of California Civil Code Section 51.5  \n11   \n90.  Plaintiffs incorporate in this cause of action the allegations contained in the preceding \n12 \nparagraphs of this Complaint as if they were set out in full herein. \n13 \n91.  Defendants are “business establishments” within the meaning of California Civil Code \n14 \nsection 51.5. \n15 \n92.  Through defendants’ collaboration in creating, developing, and/or utilizing the Ad \n16 \nPlatform’s  Multicultural  Affinity,  Exclude  People,  and  Include  People    tools,  defendants  have \n17 \nintentionally not published, not provided, and not sent ads and the information or content in those ads \n18 \nto Plaintiffs and members of the Class for products, accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, \n19 \njob opportunities, housing, or services based on the Plaintiffs and Class members’ sex, race, color, \n20 \nreligion, ancestry, national origin, marital status, citizenship, primary language, immigration status, or \n21 \nage. Defendants, through their above conduct relating to the Ad Platform’s Multicultural Affinity, \n22 \nExclude People, and Include People tools, have steered advertisements away from Plaintiffs and Class \n23 \nmembers based on the Facebook users’ sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, marital \n24 \nstatus,  citizenship,  primary  language,  immigration  status,  age  or  other  protected  personal \n25 \ncharacteristics \n26 \n93.  Facebook’s Multicultural Affinity, Exclude People, and Include People tools were used \n27 \nby Facebook’s advertisers and by Facebook itself to not publish, not provide, and not send ads and the \n28 \n33   \n                \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT \nCase No. 3:18-cv-04529-LB \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-04529-LB   Document 26   Filed 11/19/18   Page 34 of 35\n \n \n1  information in those ads to Plaintiffs and members of the Class based on their protected personal \n2  characteristics. As a result, Plaintiffs and members of the Class have been harmed by not having an \n3  equal opportunity to see or hear ads for products, accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, \n4  job opportunities, housing, or services. \n5  94.  By virtue of defendants’ collaboration in creating, developing, and/or utilizing the \n6  Multicultural Affinity, Exclude People, or Include People tools, defendants intentionally discriminated \n7  against Plaintiffs and the Class and such discrimination is prohibited by Civil Code section 51.5.  \n8  95.  Facebook,  through  its  creation,  development,  implementation,  promotion,  and \n9  marketing of its Multicultural Affinity, Exclude People, or Include People tools, and through its \n10  collaboration with its advertisers in the use of these tools, has substantially and affirmatively induced \n11  its  advertisers  to  express  illegal  preferences  of  Facebook  users  based  on  the  users’  personal \n12  characteristics or perceived personal characteristics, all of which are protected by Civil Code section \n13  51.5.  Facebook, along with its advertisers, have been responsible, in whole or in part, for the creation \n14  or development of the offending content in the ads that are sent or not sent to Class members based on \n15  certain protected personal characteristics. Facebook’s substantial affirmative conduct in promoting its \n16  advertisers’ use of its Multicultural Affinity, Exclude People, or Include People tools for unlawful \n17  purposes has resulted in the unlawful discrimination of many Facebook users. \n18  96.  Pursuant to Civil Code section 52, defendants are liable to Plaintiffs and the members \n19  of the Class for the statutory damages mandated by Civil Code section 52 for each and every offense, \n20  and attorneys’ fees that may be determined by the court in addition thereto. \n21  97.  Pursuant to Civil Code section 52, injunctive relief is necessary and appropriate to \n22  prevent defendants from repeating their discriminatory actions as alleged above.  Plaintiffs are entitled \n23  to injunctive relief on behalf of themselves and the Class. \n24  PRAYER FOR RELIEF   \n25    WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for the following relief: \n26  1.

Certify a Class under Rule 23(a) and (b)(2) and (b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil \n8  procedure, appoint Plaintiffs’ counsel as Class Counsel, and appoint the named Plaintiffs as the Class \n9  Representatives; \n10  4.
