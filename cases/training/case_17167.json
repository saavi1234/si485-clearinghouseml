          "description": "ORDER: Christopher L. Parker's Motion to Intervene / Sanctions 276 is denied. This is his fifth attempt at intervention in this case. [110, 113, 125, 274] As previously explained by the Court, intervention is improper as Petitioner is a member of the class and his interests are represented by the named class representative and class counsel. [104, 114, 151, 275] The instant motion provides no reason for the Court to reconsider its prior rulings on this point. The Court has already warned Parker it was improper to reraise previously rejected arguments. 275 His instant motion ignores this warning. The Court is obligated to protect its docket. Montgomery v. Davis, 362 F.3d 956, 957 (7th Cir. 2004) (per curiam) (quoting In re: McDonald, 489 U.S. 180, 184 (1989)) (\"'Every paper filed... no matter how repetitious or frivolous, requires some portion of the institution's limited resources. A part of the Court's responsibility is to see that these resources are allocated in a way that promotes the interests of justice.'\"); In re: Chapman, 328 F.3d 903, 905 (7th Cir. 2003) (per curiam); see also White v.

          "description": "MINUTE entry before the Honorable Virginia M. Kendall. Class member Christopher C. Parker filed what he styled as a \"motion to intervene\" 100 emphasizing a legal argument regarding the State's sentencing scheme. Mr. Parker is already a party in this case (at least for the substantive basis of this motion, arguing the law) and the purpose of intervention is to become a party, so the motion is improper. See Kifer v. Ellsworth, 346 F.3d 1155, 1156 (7th Cir. 2003). Additionally, the Court cannot construe the motion as one made to opt out of the class because there is no right to opt out of a Rule 23(b)(2) class action, and in the Court's discretion, doing so here is unnecessary anyway. See id. at 1157; see also Gray v. Hardy, 826 F.3d 1000, 1009 (7th Cir. 2016). The existing parties adequately represent Mr. Parker's interests, and he does not contend that there are any factual or legal distinctions that make his situation different from that of the named class representatives. See Zbaraz v. Madigan, 572 F.3d 370, 377 (7th Cir. 2009); see also Crawford v. Equifax Payment Servs., Inc., 201 F.3d 877, 880 (7th Cir. 2000) (stating that the only time a class member should need to intervene is if she thinks that the representative is not acting in her best interests). In fact, the point that Mr. Parker raises in his motion is consistent with the plaintiff's position in this case. Should Mr. Parker want to individually sue (for money damages) in the future, he will likely be able to do so. See Cole v. City of Memphis, 839 F.3d 530, 541 (6th Cir. 2016), cert. denied sub nom. City of Memphis, Tenn. v. Cole, 137 S. Ct. 2220 (2017); Berry v. Schulman, 807 F.3d 600, 61112 (4th Cir. 2015). But for now, the operating assumption is that \"because the relief sought is uniform, so are the interests of the class members...\" Berry, 807 F.3d at 612. So the Court decided when it certified the class. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 (requiring the court to find that the interests of all of the class members will be fairly and adequately represented by the named plaintiffs and class counsel). Mr. Parker failed to allege facts that might change this conclusion. The Court accordingly denies his motion to intervene 100 .Mailed notice (lk, ) (Entered: 12/20/2018)"

The Court denied that motion because Mr. Parker is already a class member and the existing parties adequately represent his interests. Indeed, Mr. Parker's contentions remain consistent with the Plaintiffs' position in this case. It is therefore unnecessary for Mr. Parker to intervene because the parties are finishing their briefing regarding the pending Motion for Summary Judgment 88 that the Court will then rule on in due course.

In March 2019, class member Christopher Parker filed a third \"motion to intervene\" 125 re-raising the legal arguments he has raised in his previous motions to intervene and attaching his state-court petition for a writ of habeas corpus. As this Court has already stated (See Dkt. 104, 114 ), Mr. Parker is already a class member and the existing parties adequately represent his interests. Mr. Parker's contentions remain consistent with the Plaintiffs' position in this case. His third motion to intervene 125 is again denied for this reason. Mr. Parker's brief and cursory arguments do not raise any new grounds that would cause the Court to change its position. The Court directs the Clerk's office to send Mr. Parker, with notice of this order, a copy of the Court's Memorandum Opinion and Order 132 as it may aid him in understanding that his concerns are already being addressed in this case.

    "summary": "<p>On December 12, 2016, seven prisoners in the custody of the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) filed this class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The plaintiffs sued the State of Illinois and its attorney general under 42 U.S.C. &sect;1983. Represented by private counsel, they sought declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that Illinois, by its policies regarding individuals convicted of sex-related offenses, had violated their rights under the Eight and Fourteenth Amendments. The case was assigned to Judge Virginia M. Kendall.</p>\r\n<p>Individuals convicted of certain sex-related offenses under Illinois law are subject to overlapping statutory and regulatory schemes that make it difficult for prisoners to satisfy conditions required for their release from prison. The Illinois Unified Code of Corrections provides that for all felony convictions, the sentencing court must provide within the sentencing order a term of parole or mandatory supervised release (MSR). Individuals convicted after July 1, 2005 of predatory criminal sexual assault of a child, aggravated sexual criminal assault, or criminal sexual assault, and individuals convicted after January 1, 2009 of aggravated child pornography or manufacturing or dissemination of child pornography were subject to a mandatory indeterminate term of MSR. The indeterminate duration of MSR could range from three years to life: an individual could only apply for termination of his indeterminate MSR sentence after completing three years of MSR outside of prison. A prisoner could not receive credit for MSR time served while in custody.</p>\r\n<p>The Prison Review Board (PRB) required that before inmates could be released from IDOC custody, they had to have an approved &ldquo;host site&rdquo; to reside at while serving their MSR term. IDOC only approved host sites that met all housing restrictions imposed by statute, by IDOC, and by the Prison Review Board. Illinois did not provide housing resources for inmates, and halfway homes and homeless shelters automatically rejected individuals with sex-related convictions. Each plaintiff had either submitted multiple host sites and been denied by the IDOC, or was indigent and had no housing options to select for their host site. The plaintiffs alleged that the multiple restrictions created an unmeetable condition that forced them to spend the duration of their MSR term incarcerated. For the plaintiffs that were given an indeterminate MSR sentence, the unmeetable conditions resulted in life imprisonment.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On February 17, 2017, IDOC moved to dismiss the complaint on three grounds:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Two of the plaintiffs&rsquo; claims lacked standing because they had not yet completed their incarceration sentences;</li>\r\n<li>The plaintiffs&rsquo; claim against the duration of their confinement should have been raised as a habeas action, not under 42 U.S.C. &sect;1983; and</li>\r\n<li>The plaintiffs&rsquo; claims failed to allege sufficient facts for their constitutional claims.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>On August 18, 2017, the court granted in part IDOC&rsquo;s motion to dismiss, holding that the plaintiffs did not need to file a habeas action in order to receive the requested relief, and that all constitutional claims were appropriate except for the due process claim. The court granted, however, IDOC&rsquo;s motion to dismiss with respect to two plaintiffs because their claims were based on post-release conditions and the plaintiffs had not yet been released. She further granted the motion with respect to the plaintiffs&rsquo; procedural due process claim because of vagueness.</p>\r\n<p>On December 6, 2017, the plaintiffs moved for class certification and appointment of class counsel. They sought to certify a class of inmates who had completed their sentenced term and were currently detained in the IDOC and denied release because of their inability to find an approved host site. The court approved the unopposed motion on April 6, 2018, defining the class as all individuals sentenced to serve &ldquo;three-years-to-life&rdquo; on MSR, currently detained in IDOC, who have been approved for release on MSR but have been denied release from IDOC custody because of their inability to obtain an approved host site. Once discovery ended, both parties sought summary judgment. On March 31, 2019, the court granted the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for summary judgment in part and denied IDOC&rsquo;s cross-motion for summary judgment.</p>\r\n<p>The court held that the state&rsquo;s host site requirement resulted in the continued deprivation of the plaintiffs&rsquo; Eighth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment equal protection rights. The court also addressed whether the proper vehicle to bring the plaintiffs&rsquo; claims was 42 U.S.C. &sect;1983 or a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, and determined that the plaintiffs properly brought their claims under 42 U.S.C. &sect;1983 because they were not seeking release from custody, but rather the proper application of law to their situation. The court found that there was a genuine issue material fact as to whether IDOC offered a procedure for determining the validity of a decision to deny a host site, and denied summary judgment on that claim.</p>\r\n<p>Both parties met on May 1, 2019, for a settlement conference and held further status hearings on June 18, 2019, October 1, 2019, December 3, 2019, January 2, 2020.</p>\r\n<p>On January 15, 2020, the court granted a permanent injunction. According to the order, IDOC was required to present a plan, as well as quarterly reports outlining steps that would be taken to ensure that by January 2, 2021, no class member would remain in IDOC custody due to an inability to locate a host site.</p>\r\n<p>On January 29, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a bill of costs, and on February 18, 2020, the court awarded costs to the plaintiffs in the amount of $3,015.41.</p>\r\n<p>On February 27, 2020, IDOC presented a compliance plan to the court, pursuant to the injunction. The plan outlined the steps that IDOC had already taken to assist class members, such as host site policy changes and a review of host site denials. It also outlined additional steps that IDOC was then undertaking to release class members, such as finalizing a Request for Proposal for licensed transitional housing locations for sex offenders, and cooperation with the Illinois Department of Human Services to identify appropriate placements and/or services for class members who would likely qualify for that department&rsquo;s services upon their release.</p>\r\n<p>On June 15, 2020, IDOC presented a quarterly report further outlining the steps that it was then taking to release class members.</p>\r\n<p>As of July 2020, the court&rsquo;s supervision of the settlement is ongoing.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "summary_short": "In 2016, prisoners that had completed their sentences but remained incarcerated by the Illinois Department of Corrections filed this class action against the state in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The plaintiffs alleged that the Illinois statutory scheme governing mandatory supervised release (MSR) for sex offenders and the requirement for offenders to have an approved “host site” in order to be released from custody violated their Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The court awarded the plaintiffs summary judgment on the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment claims.  The court entered a permanent injunction on January 15, 2020,  requiring IDOC to present a plan for releasing class members from custody, and quarterly reports outlining steps that were being taken to ensure that all class members would be properly released by January 2, 2021.  As of July 2020, the court's supervision of IDOC's progress is ongoing.",

Class member Christopher\nC. Parker filed what he styled as a \"motion to intervene\" 100 emphasizing a legal\nargument regarding the State's sentencing scheme. Mr. Parker is already a party in this\ncase (at least for the substantive basis of this motion, arguing the law) and the purpose\nof intervention is to become a party, so the motion is improper. See Kifer v. Ellsworth,\n346 F.3d 1155, 1156 (7th Cir. 2003). Additionally, the Court cannot construe the\nmotion as one made to opt out of the class because there is no right to opt out of a Rule\n23(b)(2) class action, and in the Court's discretion, doing so here is unnecessary\nanyway. See id. at 1157; see also Gray v. Hardy, 826 F.3d 1000, 1009 (7th Cir. 2016).\nThe existing parties adequately represent Mr. Parker's interests, and he does not\ncontend that there are any factual or legal distinctions that make his situation different\nfrom that of the named class representatives. See Zbaraz v. Madigan, 572 F.3d 370,\n377 (7th Cir. 2009); see also Crawford v. Equifax Payment Servs., Inc., 201 F.3d 877,\n880 (7th Cir. 2000) (stating that the only time a class member should need to intervene\nis if she thinks that the representative is not acting in her best interests). In fact, the\npoint that Mr. Parker raises in his motion is consistent with the plaintiff's position in\nthis case. Should Mr. Parker want to individually sue (for money damages) in the\nfuture, he will likely be able to do so. See Cole v. City of Memphis, 839 F.3d 530, 541\n(6th Cir. 2016), cert. denied sub nom. City of Memphis, Tenn. v. Cole, 137 S. Ct. 2220\n(2017); Berry v. Schulman, 807 F.3d 600, 61112 (4th Cir. 2015). But for now, the\noperating assumption is that \"because the relief sought is uniform, so are the interests\nof the class members...\" Berry, 807 F.3d at 612. So the Court decided when it certified\nthe class. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 (requiring the court to find that the interests of all of\nthe class members will be fairly and adequately represented by the named plaintiffs\nand class counsel). Mr. Parker failed to allege facts that might change this conclusion.\nThe Court accordingly denies his motion to intervene 100 .Mailed notice (lk, )\n(Entered: 12/20/2018)\n01/08/2019 105  MINUTE entry before the Honorable Sidney I.

Kendall \n \n)   \nKWAME RAOUL∗ et al., \n)    \n \n) \n                     Defendants. \n) \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER \n  Paul Murphy is indigent and homeless.  He was convicted of possession of child \npornography in 2012 and received a sentence of three years’ probation.  Five years \nafter his release date, and nearly twice the number of years of his sentence, he re-\nmains incarcerated because the Department of Corrections cannot find an appropri-\nate place for him live. \nIllinois, like many states, requires sentencing courts to follow a term of impris-\nonment with a term of mandatory supervised release.  Supervised release is a form \nof post-confinement monitoring intended to assist individuals in their transition from \nprison to liberty.  Most supervised release terms are determinate, but some—includ-\ning those that apply to several sex offenses—are indeterminate, meaning they range \nfrom three years to natural life.  The clock on these terms does not start ticking until \n                                                 \n∗ Because Kwame Raoul became the Attorney General of Illinois on January 14, 2019, he \nautomatically substitutes in as a defendant.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(d). \nPage 1 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 2 of 61 PageID #:1507\nsex offenders are out of prison, but some never make it that far because they are \nindigent and the State demands that they first secure a qualifying host site before it \nwill release them.  Many offenders successfully complete their entire court-ordered \nterms of incarceration yet remain detained indefinitely because they are unable find \na residence due to indigence and lack of support. \n  The question presented is whether this practice violates the Constitution.  The \nplaintiffs are a class comprising the affected sex offenders and the defendants are the \nAttorney General of Illinois and the Director of the Illinois Department of Correc-\ntions.  Both parties moved for summary judgment.  (Dkts. 75, 88.)  The Court now \ngrants the plaintiffs’ motion (Dkt. 75) in part, denies it in part, and denies the de-\nfendants’ cross-motion in full (Dkt. 88).  At the very heart of the liberty secured by \nthe separation of powers is freedom from indefinite imprisonment by executive de-\ncree.  The Attorney General and Director’s current application of the host site re-\nquirement results in the continued deprivation of the plaintiffs’ fundamental rights \nand therefore contravenes the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitu-\ntion of the United States. \nBACKGROUND \n  In Illinois, almost every criminal sentence includes a mandatory supervised \nrelease (“MSR”) term that follows the term of imprisonment.  See 730 ILCS 5/5-4.5-\n15(c).  Most MSR terms are determinate, meaning the Legislature sets a finite num-\nber of years for the offender to serve.  Some terms, however—including those that \nattach to certain sex offenses—are indeterminate, “rang[ing] from a minimum of 3 \nPage 2 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 3 of 61 PageID #:1508\nyears to a maximum of natural life.”  Id. 5/5-8-1(4)(d).  In those cases, sentencing \ncourts must impose an indeterminate term of three years to natural life.  See People \nv. Rinehart, 2012 IL 111719, ¶¶ 29–30. \nStatutory Scheme \n  The Illinois Legislature vested both the Prisoner Review Board (PRB) and the \nDepartment of Corrections (IDOC) with authority over MSR.  See Cordrey v. Prisoner \nReview Bd., 2014 IL 117155, ¶ 20.  The Supreme Court of Illinois explained the rela-\ntionship between the PRB and the IDOC in Cordrey: \nThe Prisoner Review Board is independent of the Department of Correc-\ntions. 730 ILCS 5/3–3–1(a) (West 2012). The Prisoner Review Board is \n“the authority for setting conditions for parole, mandatory supervised \nrelease under Section 5–8–1(a) of this [Unified] Code [of Corrections], \nand determining whether a violation of those conditions warrant revo-\ncation of parole or mandatory supervised release or the imposition of \nother sanctions.” 730 ILCS 5/3–3–1(a)(5) (West 2012). \n \n¶ 21 The Prisoner Review Board has wide discretion in setting the con-\nditions of MSR. “The conditions of parole or mandatory supervised re-\nlease shall be such as the Prisoner Review Board deems necessary to \nassist the subject in leading a law-abiding life.” 730 ILCS 5/3–3–7(a) \n(West 2012). Although the Prisoner Review Board has wide discretion, \nthe legislature has mandated that certain sex offenders are required to \nwear  an  approved  electronic  monitoring  device.  730  ILCS  5/3–3–\n7(a)(7.7) (West 2012). \n \n¶ 22 While the Prisoner Review Board is the authority for setting condi-\ntions for MSR and determining whether a violation of those conditions \nwarrants revocation of MSR, the Department of Corrections retains cus-\ntody of all persons placed on parole or MSR. See 730 ILCS 5/3–14–2(a) \n(West 2012). The Department of Corrections “shall supervise such per-\nsons during their parole or release period in accord with the conditions \nset by the Prisoner Review Board. * * * Such conditions may include that \nthe person use an approved electronic monitoring device * * *.” 730 ILCS \n5/3–14–2(a) (West 2012). Included within the Department’s custody are \n“all sex offenders placed on mandatory supervised release.” 730 ILCS \n5/3–14–2.5(a)  (West  2012).  The  legislature  has  directed  that  the \nPage 3 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 4 of 61 PageID #:1509\nDepartment of Corrections “shall assign personnel to assist persons eli-\ngible for parole in preparing a parole plan. Such Department personnel \nshall make a report of their efforts and findings to the Prisoner Review \nBoard prior to its consideration of the case of such eligible person.” 730 \nILCS 5/3–14–2(b) (West 2012). \n \n¶ 23 A parolee or releasee’s supervising officer “shall report violations to \nthe Prisoner Review Board and shall have the full power of peace officers \nin the arrest and retaking of any parolees or releasees or the officer may \nrequest the Department to issue a warrant for the arrest of any parolee \nor releasee who has allegedly violated his parole or release conditions.” \n730 ILCS 5/3–14–2(c) (West 2012). The Code provides that, “[t]o assist \nparolees or releasees, the Department shall provide employment coun-\nseling and job placement services, and may in addition to other services \nprovide the following: (1) assistance in residential placement.” (Empha-\nsis added.) 730 ILCS 5/3–14–3(1) (West 2012). \n \n2014 IL 117155, ¶¶ 20–23.  So, the PRB sets the conditions for an inmate’s MSR, but \nthe Legislature directed the IDOC to assist inmates with finding a suitable “host site” \nfor residential placement.  See id. ¶ 24. \n  Even if the PRB approves an individual for MSR, the IDOC will not extricate \nthat person unless and until he or she satisfies certain conditions, most importantly \nsecuring a qualifying host site to reside at while on MSR.  (Dkt. 91 ¶ 2.)  The IDOC \nexercises the sole power to approve or deny an inmate’s proposed host site based on \na variety of statutes and regulations that restrict where sex offenders may live while \non MSR.  Id. ¶¶ 3–5.  Ultimately, a parole agent must okay the placement.  Id. ¶ 4.   \nIn the case of a someone who is labeled a sex offender, a variety of other stat-\nutes and rules also kick in to restrict where and how that individual may reside.  \nThese include registration laws and regulations that prohibit sex offenders from liv-\ning a certain number of feet from schools, parks, and day care centers, as examples.  \nThe only time a person can apply for the termination of his or her indeterminate MSR \nPage 4 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 5 of 61 PageID #:1510\nterm is after successfully serving three years of that term outside of prison.  Id.  ¶ 5.  \nTaken together, what all this means is that someone who the PRB approves for re-\nlease after serving his or her entire term of imprisonment will remain indefinitely \nconfined if the individual is unable to identify a host site that passes muster.  Id. \nHost Site Review \n  No more than six months before release, an inmate may propose a host site by \ngiving an address to the field services representative or counselor at the facility who \nthen enters that information into a database.  (Dkt. 107 ¶ 1.)  Next, the database \nroutes the proposed host site to the appropriate district, where the parole commander \nverifies the receiving district is correct and that the MSR date of entry is no more \nthan six months away.  Id.  ¶ 2.  If those things check out, the commander assigns \nthe host site to a parole agent.  Id.  The assigned agent begins the host site investi-\ngation by checking the Department’s mapping software for day care centers and \nschools within 500 feet of the address.  Id. ¶ 3.  If none appear, the agent turns to \nGoogle Earth to check for playgrounds, parks, and other facilities providing programs \nexclusively for minors.  Id.  If any such grounds come up in the search, the agent will \ngenerally deny the site.  Id. \n  Moving forward, the agent calls the local registering agency, usually the police \ndepartment, to verify that it will register an offender at the specified address because \nstate law requires it.  Id. ¶ 4.  The police department, in fact, has the authority to \narrest and return to IDOC custody a sex offender who violates any of the residency \nPage 5 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 6 of 61 PageID #:1511\nrestriction statutes.  Id.  Thus, if the local police department states that it will not \nregister the offender at that address, the IDOC agent will deny the host site.  Id. \n  Following the call with the police department, the parole agent visits the pro-\nposed host site.  Id. ¶ 5.  During this visit, the agent looks for day care centers or \nplaygrounds that he or she perhaps missed on the map.  Id.  The agent will also meet \nwith the host, if any, to ensure that he or she is indeed willing to have the offender \nreside there and understands all the rules.  Id. ¶ 6.  Additionally, the agent will de-\ntermine who else resides in the house and confirm that any co-owners or co-lease-\nholders agreed to the offender living there.  Id.  The agent’s overarching aim and \nobjective is to ensure that the home will be a good environment, meaning financially \nand emotionally supportive, physically safe, and structurally sound.  Id. ¶ 7. \n  If at any point in the process the agent denies a host site, the parole com-\nmander informally reviews the denial to make certain that it is reasonable and mer-\nitorious.  Id. ¶ 8; Dkt. 91 ¶ 24.  The commander has the prerogative to affirm or \nreverse the agent’s decision.  (Dkt. 107 ¶ 8.)  But the parties dispute whether there is \na formal process for a person to contest the decision of a parole agent to deny approval \nof a host site.  (Dkt. 91 ¶ 22; Dkt. 107 ¶ 29.)  The plaintiffs claim there is no such \nprocedure through the proper channels in the IDOC, while the defendants state that \nan offender who disagrees with the denial of a host site may file a grievance at his or \nher facility.  (Dkt. 91 ¶ 22.)  In the defendants’ view, the counselor or grievance officer \nat the facility can request that the IDOC Parole Department reinvestigate a denied \nhost site.  Id.  If the objection appears to be meritorious, the Parole Commander can \nPage 6 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 7 of 61 PageID #:1512\neither ask the original agent assigned to take a second look or may put a new agent \non the case to investigate the site.  Id.  The plaintiffs dispute this, asserting again \nthat the IDOC does not treat denials of parole sites as grievable issues.  (Dkt. 107 \n¶ 30.) \n  The defendants so state, even though their witness 30(b)(6) witness testified \nthat he did not know whether the denial of a host site is a grievable issue.  (Dkt. 91 \n¶ 22 (citing in part Pl. Ex. 14, Dep. of Dixon, at 114:20–115:3); Dkt. 107 ¶ 29; Dkt. \n128 ¶ 160.)  What is more is that the IDOC denied one of the class members’ griev-\nances because “‘IDOC does not set sex offender laws.’”  (Dkt. 91 ¶ 26 (quoting Ex. 21).)  \nThe Administrative Review Board denied review of that decision because “‘[i]ssues \nare outside the scope of the ARB.’”  Id. (quoting Ex. 21).  The defendants did not cite \na single example of a grievance concerning a host-site denial being reviewed or over-\nturned.  (Dkt. 107 ¶ 29.)  \n  An offender may also contact the parole agent’s supervisor to request review of \nthe agent’s decision.  (Dkt. 91 ¶ 23.)  But the parties dispute whether anybody advises \nthese individuals of this right or gives them any information about how they can con-\ntest an unfavorable disposition.  Id.  The defendants acknowledge that the source the \nplaintiffs cite for the proposition that offenders never receive notice of this right or \nany information about potential review does not support that assertion; however, in \nthe same breath they do not provide any evidence suggesting when they are in fact \ngiven this information.  Id. (“While the cited source does not include this information, \nthis does not mean that parolees are never given this information.”). \nPage 7 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 8 of 61 PageID #:1513\n  What  is  clear  is  that  there  is  no  formal  PRB  procedure  that  determines \nwhether a parole agent’s rejection of a proposed host site was appropriate or not.  Id. \n¶ 25.  “The parolee has no opportunity to contest the parole agent’s decision(s) to \nreject proposed housing at a PRB hearing and the PRB does not review the IDOC’s \ndecision to reject proposed host sites.”  Id.   \nHousing Restrictions \n  For at least the first two years of their indeterminate MSR terms, many sex \noffenders must participate in an electronic home detention program.  (Dkt. 91 ¶ 6 \n(citing 730 ILCS 5/5-8A-3(g).)  The parties dispute whether the technology utilized \nrequires a landline.  (Dkt. 91 ¶ 6; Dkt. 107 ¶¶ 16, 20; Dkt. 108 ¶ 151; Dkt. 128 ¶¶ 150–\n51.)  By the plaintiffs’ account, the IDOC has a “preference” for a landline, but the \nequipment can function without one so long as cellular service exists in the area.  \n(Dkt. 107 ¶¶ 16, 20; Dkt. 108 ¶ 150.)  The PRB may impose additional residential \nconditions on sex offenders while they are on MSR, such as prohibiting them from \n“‘resid[ing] near . . . parks, schools, day care centers, swimming pools, beaches, thea-\nters, or any other places where minor children congregate’” without the prior approval \nof the IDOC.  (Dkt. 91 ¶ 10 (quoting 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(b-1)(12).) \n  The statute does not define “near” and thus leaves it up to the IDOC to exercise \nits discretion in determining whether a proposed host site is too near an off-limits \nlocation.  Id.  That said, the Department generally considers “near” to be 500 feet, \nconsistent with the statute that restricts child sex offenders from residing within 500 \nfeet of schools, playgrounds, and daycare facilities.  Id. ¶¶ 10, 11 (citing 720 ILCS \nPage 8 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 9 of 61 PageID #:1514\n5/11-9.3).  On top of that, IDOC parole agents have the option to bar a sex offender \nwhose victim was an adult from living near locations where the offender had commit-\nted crimes in the past, such as a massage parlor or nail shop.  Id. ¶ 11. \n  There is another statute that prohibits one sex offender from residing in the \nsame “condominium complex or apartment complex” as another offender, and the \nIDOC interprets that to mean that more than one sex offender cannot live in the same \ntrailer park, unless each trailer is on separately-owned land.  Id. ¶ 12.  The IDOC \nseems to interpret it that way because the Illinois State Police and the Chicago Police \nDepartment said it was so.  Id. ¶ 13. \n  With respect to computers and other electronics in the home, the IDOC ana-\nlyzes each request to live at a host site with internet access on a case-by-case basis.  \nId. ¶¶ 14, 17.  The plaintiffs dispute this contention because the written policies, by \ntheir count, indicate the opposite.  (Dkt. 107 ¶¶ 22–24.)  The defendants claim that \nthe Department recently promogulated new guidelines that proscribe internet-re-\nlated sex offenders from living in an internet-accessible home while individuals con-\nvicted of offenses not relating to the internet (and with no history of misusing com-\nputers or the internet) may be allowed to reside in a home with internet access.  (Dkt. \n91 ¶¶ 14, 17.) \n  The plaintiffs see it the other way and contend that it fails to address the res-\nidency restrictions dealing with internet access.  (Dkt. 107 ¶¶ 22–24.)  Moreover, as \na practical matter, the plaintiffs say the IDOC does not let any sex offender live in a \nhost site with computers or other devices.  (Dkt. 91 ¶¶ 14–17; Dkt. 107 ¶¶ 22–24.)  To \nPage 9 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 10 of 61 PageID #:1515\nillustrate, Daniel Barron’s conviction for criminal sexual assault did not involve the \nuse of a computer or the internet but he still may not access it.  Dkt. 108 ¶¶ 148, 158; \nDkt. 128 ¶ 158.  By plaintiffs’ count, Jason Tucker, Nicole Uhlir, Jennifer Tyree, Mike \nDiMichele, Bill Carney, and Robin Frazier’s crimes all were unrelated to the internet, \nbut notwithstanding that, the IDOC prohibits them from paroling to host sites with \ninternet access.  Id. ¶¶ 153–157, 159; Dkt. 128 ¶¶ 153–57, 159. \n  Upon sex offenders’ initial release, the IDOC forbids all of them—whether con-\nvicted of crimes against adults or children—from living in a home where children also \nlive or even visits “one time.”  (Dkt. 91 ¶¶ 18, 20.)  Even so, a parent of a minor child \nmay at some undefined later point request the ability to visit or live with the child.  \nId. ¶ 18.  In other words, the IDOC will not release a married parent of a minor child \nto his or her own home to be with his or her spouse and child.  Id.  The only way that \nindividual can get out of prison is if he or she can obtain a residence separate and \napart from his or her family.  Id.1 \n  Parole agents have the additional discretion to deny approval of host sites for \nthe presence of any of the following: a dog or other pets; alcohol; children’s toys or \nclothes; devices that can access the internet like an iPad (perhaps on a case-by-case \nbasis); pictures of children (even if those children are relatives of the individual on \nMSR or his or her own child); cameras, binoculars, telescopes, video equipment; \n                                                 \n1 This specific exercise of discretion is very troubling; however, the Court notes that Judge \nFeinerman is currently considering the constitutional propriety of this restriction in Frazier \net al. v. Baldwin, No. 18-1991 (N.D. Ill. 2018).  Because none of the plaintiffs in this case are \nparents or allege any deprivation of parental rights, the Court need not address the issue in \nany more detail. \nPage 10 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 11 of 61 PageID #:1516\ngaming systems; and safes.  Id. ¶ 21.  If the host agrees to remove the problematic \nitems, however, the agent can still approve the site.  Id. \nTransitional and Interstate Housing \n  There are no halfway houses or transitional housing facilities in Illinois that \nwill accept an individual convicted of a sex offense.  Id. ¶ 28; Dkt. 107 ¶ 25.  Addition-\nally, the IDOC does not permit any sex offender to use a homeless shelter as his or \nher host site.  (Dkt. 91 ¶ 29.)  This group of people is also ineligible for work release \nprograms that the IDOC provides.  Id. ¶ 30.  It is possible for an offender to serve his \nor her MSR term outside of Illinois, however he or she must satisfy the criteria for \ntransfers under the Interstate Compact for Adult Supervision.  Id. ¶ 31; Dkt. 107 ¶ 9.  \nThese criteria include, in part, a requirement that the individual will either receive \nincome or other financial support in the receiving state.  (Dkt. 91 ¶ 31; Dkt. 107 ¶ 9–\n10.)  The person can prove that they receive such support with evidence that he or \nshe has a job, a letter from a family member or friend agreeing to cover him or her, \nevidence that he or she receives adequate government benefits, or possibly through \nother means.  (Dkt. 91 ¶ 32; Dkt. 107 ¶ 9–10.) \n  Illinois also expects the receiving state to follow its parole conditions but does \nnot require the receiving state to follow its statutes relating to sex offenders more \ngenerally.  Id. ¶ 31.  For instance, if the receiving state cannot comply with a certain \nparole condition, such as GPS monitoring, then that state must supervise the offender \nat the “next closest level of supervision, consistent with how the receiving state su-\npervise[s] its own offenders for a similar offense.”  Id.  The Illinois DOC will generally \nPage 11 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 12 of 61 PageID #:1517\nnot approve a transfer if a child or any one of the offender’s previous victims (whether \nsex-related or not) reside at the proposed host site.  (Dkt. 107 ¶ 12.)   \n  An out-of-state host site must conform to all restrictions imposed by the receiv-\ning state.  (Dkt. 91 ¶ 33.)  The receiving state ultimately has the discretion to deny a \ndiscretionary transfer request based on several grounds, including that the parolee \nseeks transfer to a state where he or she does not have a “qualifying family member” \n(a parent, spouse, adult child, sibling, grandparent, aunt, or uncle).  Id.  ¶ 34.  In \ntotal, 43 people are currently serving their MSR terms outside of Illinois.  Id. ¶ 35.  \nOnly one of those people was a “discretionary transfer,” meaning all others docu-\nmented their financial and housing support of at least one family member in the re-\nceiving state.  Id. ¶ 36. \nClass Members \n  Paul Murphy \n  Paul Murphy is currently incarcerated at Taylorville Correctional Center even \nthough a court only sentenced him to 36 months of probation on one count of aggra-\nvated possession of child pornography in 2012.  Id. ¶ 39.  About halfway into his sen-\ntence, the court revoked his probation because he was homeless and residing in the \ndoorway of a building located within 150 feet of a park, in addition to the facts that: \nhis specialized sex offender treatment program unsatisfactorily discharged him; he \nfailed to appear for a scheduled field visit; and he provided false information to his \nprobation officer regarding his employment status.  Id. ¶ 40.  In 2014, the court \namended Murphy’s sentence to include an MSR term of three years to life.  Id. ¶ 41.  \nPage 12 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 13 of 61 PageID #:1518\nThe PRB approved him for release in March 2014.  Id. ¶ 42.  The IDOC did not release \nhim then because Murphy was unable to find a host site that the IDOC would ap-\nprove.  Id. ¶ 43. \n  Although Murphy has attempted to secure a compliant host site, Murphy re-\nmains incarcerated because he cannot do so.  Id. ¶¶ 43–44.  For example, Murphy \napplied to live in a halfway house in East St. Louis.  Id. ¶ 45.  This effort, amongst \nothers, was unsuccessful because Murphy cannot live in homeless shelters, missions, \nor halfway houses seeing that none currently accept sex offenders.  Id. ¶ 46.  Murphy \nadditionally applied to a work release facility that rejected him and a technology boot \ncamp program that has not gotten back to him yet.  Id. ¶ 47.  Murphy cannot afford \nto purchase or lease any property of his own, and he does not have a spouse or any \nfamily who can support him.  Id. ¶¶ 48–49.  Murphy filed a grievance with the IDOC, \nbut the Department denied it as well as his subsequent appeal, explaining that it \n“‘does not make sex offender laws.’”  Id. ¶ 50. \n  Jasen Gustafsen \n  Jasen Gustafsen is currently incarcerated at Lincoln Correctional Center.  Id. \n¶ 51.  In 2013, a court sentenced him to a four-year term of imprisonment (at 50%) \nafter he pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated possession of child pornography.  \nId.  Accompanying Gustafsen’s prison term was an MSR term of three years to life.  \nId.  The PRB approved Gustafsen for release in October 2014.  Id. ¶ 52.  As soon as \npossible,  Gustafsen  began  submitting  host  sites  for  approval,  starting  with  his \nmother’s residence, which the IDOC denied because of its proximity to a day care.  Id. \nPage 13 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 14 of 61 PageID #:1519\n¶ 53.  The IDOC rejected Gustafsen’s second bid for a host site because his aunt oc-\ncasionally had her young grandchildren visit her home.  Id. ¶ 54.  Outside of his \nmother and aunt, Gustafsen has no family or friends who are willing and able to help \nhim find hosing.  Id. ¶ 56.  For his part, Gustafsen has no resources to pay for his own \nhousing.  Id. ¶ 60.  Gustafsen submitted a grievance to the PRB but never received a \nresponse.  Id. ¶ 62.2 \n  J.D. Lindenmeier \n  J.D. Lindenmeier is presently incarcerated at Taylorville Correctional Center.  \nId. ¶ 63.  In 2006, a court sentenced him to six years’ imprisonment (at 85%) after it \nconvicted him of one count of predatory criminal assault of a child.  Id.  An MSR term \nof three years to life accompanied Lindenmeier’s sentence.  Id.  The PRB approved \nLindenmeier for release in July 2011.  Id.  Lindenmeier submitted the addresses of \nall his family members and friends, but the IDOC denied all of them.  Id. ¶ 64.  The \nDepartment denied Lindenmeier’s father’s residence because it was within 150 feet \nof a park with a playground area.  Id. ¶ 65.  It rejected Lindenmeier’s mother’s home \ndue to the presence of computers, smartphones, and weapons in the home.  Id.  The \nIDOC denied his sister’s home because she has two children living with her and it is \nwithin 500 feet of a daycare.  Id.  The Department rejected Lindenmeier’s father’s \ngirlfriend’s home because it was within 500 feet of a park with a playground area.  Id.  \nThe IDOC denied another friend’s residence as a host site because it was within 500 \nfeet of a daycare.  Id. \n                                                 \n2 The defendants indicated in their reply brief that the IDOC released Gustafsen to an ap-\nproved host site in Urbana in February 2019.  (Dkt. 127 at 24.) \nPage 14 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 15 of 61 PageID #:1520\n  Lindenmeier wrote numerous halfway houses and all of them rejected him.  Id. \n¶ 67.  He also investigated the possibility of work release, but an IDOC counselor \nadvised him that applying would be futile considering his sex offender status.  Id. \n¶ 68.  On his own, Lindenmier has no money to look for or pay for housing.  Id. ¶ 69.  \nBeyond himself and the family and friends he tried to work with, Lindenmeier has \nno other family members or friends who can help him.  Id. ¶ 70.  Lindenmeier is \nunmarried, has no children, his family cannot afford to put him up somewhere, and \nthey cannot move their home to assist him either.  Id.  Lindenmeier submitted a \ngrievance but the IDOC officials at Taylorville responded that it was out of their pur-\nview.  Id. ¶ 71.  He resubmitted the grievance to Springfield, but those officials re-\ntorted that it was not a Parole Board issue.  Id. \n  Stanley Meyer \n  Stanley Meyer is currently incarcerated at Taylorville Correctional Center.  Id. \n¶ 71.  In 2008, a court convicted him of one count of criminal sexual assault and ac-\ncordingly sentenced him to a 48-month term of imprisonment (at 85%) with an MSR \nterm of three years to life.  Id. ¶ 72.  The PRB approved Meyer for release in July \n2011.  Id. ¶ 73.  Meyer cannot support himself financially, and he has little to no \ncontact with his family, who are unwilling or unable to help him.  Id. ¶¶ 74–75.  As \nhis  release  date  approached  back  in  2011,  Meyer  applied  to  numerous  halfway \nhouses, but they all rejected him.  Id. ¶ 76.  Meyer sought aid from other family and \nfriends to no avail.  Id. ¶ 77. \nPage 15 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 16 of 61 PageID #:1521\n  While incarcerated, Meyer has met with the PRB on several occasions.  Id. \n¶ 78.  The meetings generally last two to three minutes because Meyer does not have \nany addresses he can submit for approval.  Id.  One official indicated multiple times \nthat he would examine Meyer’s situation, however the circumstances remain un-\nchanged to date.  Id.  When Meyer’s MSR term began, the head of counselors informed \nhim that he would only remain incarcerated for two years after receiving the violation \nfor lack of a suitable host site.  Id. ¶ 79.  Meyer is now in his seventh year of incar-\nceration past his original release date in December 2011.  Id. ¶ 80. \n  Cinszeo Doss \n  Cinszeo Doss is presently imprisoned at Graham Correctional Center.  Id. ¶ 84.  \nIn 2009, a court sentenced him to 54 months (at 85%) after he pleaded guilty to one \ncount of criminal sexual assault.  Id.  While serving his time, Doss learned that his \nsentence included an MSR term of three years to life.  Id.  Upon his release in 2012, \nDoss procured a residence with the help of his mother.  Id. ¶ 85.  Two years later, he \nhad two jobs and multiple trade certificates from Kennedy King College.  Id.  A few \nyears after his release, correctional staff informed him that his residence was no \nlonger in compliance with the conditions of his MSR because another sex offender \nmoved in nearby.  Id. ¶ 86.  The defendants contend that they gave Doss multiple \nextensions to find another host site during this time, and indeed, Doss’s parole agent \napproved five different sites.  Id. \n  Once reincarcerated, Doss submitted additional host sites that the IDOC ulti-\nmately denied.  Id. ¶ 87.  The Department denied several of them because they were \nPage 16 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 17 of 61 PageID #:1522\nwithin 500 feet of one or more licensed day care centers, and another because it was \njust over 500 feet from an elementary school (and on a school route for children).  Id.  \nThe agent was concerned about that specific address because Doss’s offense was \nagainst a 13-year-old girl.  Id.  Later, the IDOC denied Doss’s host sites because a \nday care center and play lot were within 500 feet of one, and there was a minor child \nliving in the other (in addition to computers).  Id. ¶ 88.   The IDOC denied another \nhost site after Doss’s parole agent spoke with the landlord, after which the landlord \nstated that Doss’s mother lied to her about Doss’s status, instead telling her Doss was \nnot a sex offender.  Id. ¶ 89.  She then concluded that she did not want any felons on \nher property and the placement fell through.  Id.  Doss’s family has made multiple \ntrips to a parole office to advocate for him, and the plaintiffs allege that Doss’s family \nis consistently met with aggression.  Id. ¶ 90.3 \n  Charles Dobson \n  Charles Dobson is currently incarcerated at Taylorville Correctional Center.  \nId. ¶ 91.  In 2008, a court sentenced him to ten years’ imprisonment (at 85%) after \nconvicting him of aggravated criminal sexual abuse and predatory criminal sexual \nassault.  Id.  Dobson’s MSR term is now three years to life, though it was not always \nso.  Id.  Dobson has no financial resources of his own that he can use to pay for hous-\ning.  Id. ¶ 92.  He has tried to find an appropriate host site but has not had any luck.  \nId. ¶ 93.  The IDOC rejected his father’s home because it is directly adjacent to a \nwooded park operated by the local park district, not to mention the fact that the \n                                                 \n3 The defendants noted in their reply brief that the IDOC released Doss in February 2019.  \n(Dkt. 127 at 24.) \nPage 17 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 18 of 61 PageID #:1523\nvillage refused to register Dobson at that address.  Id.  The parole agent was ready \nto approve the address upon receipt of a letter from the police department permitting \nDobson to live there.  Id.  But, even after the agent followed up a second time, the \ndepartment never provided the letter.  Id.  The IDOC denied another host site because \nit was 121 feet from a park that includes a playground.  Id. ¶ 94. \n  In considering an additional placement, the Department rejected it because \nanother sex offender lived in the building next to it and the same person owned both \nbuildings.  Id.  The IDOC, for its part, interprets the statutory restriction on residing \nin the same “condominium complex or apartment complex” as another sex offender to \nmean that only one sex offender may live amongst adjoining properties owned by the \nsame person or business.  Id.  Dobson also reached out to multiple transitional hous-\ning organizations but heard back that they cannot help sex offenders in Illinois.  Id. \n¶ 95. \n  Alfred Aukema \n  Alfred Aukema is presently imprisoned at Taylorville Correctional Center.  Id. \n¶ 97.  In 2012, a court sentenced him to a five-year term of imprisonment (at 85%) \nafter convicting him of criminal sexual assault with the use of force.  Id.  Aukema \nadditionally received an MSR term of three years to life.  Id.  Since September 2017, \nAukema has been eligible for release.  Id.  Aukema has no spouse and no money to \nhis name.  Id. ¶ 98.  Aukema made three attempts to obtain a proper host site; all \nthree failed.  Id. ¶ 99.  The IDOC denied the first address because the first owner is \ncurrently incarcerated at Taylorville.  Id.  It denied the second address, in a trailer \nPage 18 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 19 of 61 PageID #:1524\npark, because another sex offender lived in a different unit on the other side of the \npark.  Id. \n  Using its restrictions, the California Department of Corrections denied the \nthird address because his aunt’s grandchildren visited her there and firearms were \non the property.  Id.  Aukema has been otherwise unsuccessful in his search, due in \npart to the fact that halfway houses, religious organizations, and other third-party \nentities will not assist an offender with a three-to-life MSR term in Illinois.  Id. ¶ 100.  \nAukema has no other host sites to propose.  Id. ¶ 101.  With that in mind, Aukema \nwould like the Department to release him into homelessness so he can get a job while \nliving in a shelter and save up the money for his own place.  Id.  Short of that, Au-\nkemea is “‘afraid that the only way [he] will ever get out of [t]here is if [he] die[s].’”  \nId. ¶ 102. \n  Jonathan Sparks \n  Jonathan Sparks is currently incarcerated at Big Muddy River Correctional \nCenter.  Id. ¶ 103.  A court convicted him of criminal sexual assault and sentenced \nhim to four years imprisonment with an MSR term of three years to life in 2010.  Id.  \nSparks became eligible to serve his MSR term in July 2013.  Id. ¶ 104.  Because \nSparks is single and has no real assets, he has no way of paying for housing.  Id. \n¶ 105.  He additionally has no family or friends in Illinois to help him.  Id. ¶ 106.  For \nthat reason, Sparks has tried to utilize the Interstate Compact, but authorities have \ndenied each of his proposed host sites.  Id. \nPage 19 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 20 of 61 PageID #:1525\n  For instance, the Colorado Department of Corrections denied his father’s home \nbecause of “unsafe living conditions,” neglecting to explain that conclusion any fur-\nther.  Id.  The Nebraska Department of Corrections denied his mother’s home because \nSparks’ uncle, another sex offender, lives there.  Id.  Finally, the California Depart-\nment of Corrections rejected his uncle’s home because it was about 400 feet away from \na school.  Id.  Sparks also contacted a mission for assistance, but it refused to aid.  Id. \n¶ 107.  When the Illinois Department of Corrections attempted to place him at a dif-\nferent ministry, Sparks turned the Department down.  Id.  With nobody else to turn \nto, Sparks fears he will be trapped in prison for the rest of his life.  Id. ¶ 108. \n  Christopher Korszlak \n  Christopher Korszlak is presently imprisoned at Robinson Correctional Cen-\nter.  Id. ¶ 109.  In 2014, a court convicted him of possession of child pornography \n(class 2) and accordingly sentenced him to six years (at 50%) in prison.  Id.  Korszlak’s \nsentenced includes an MSR term of three years to life, which he has been eligible to \nserve since October 2015.  Id.  Korszlak is divorced and has no assets or savings.  Id. \n¶ 110.  Korszlak, for his part, has proposed one host site, which the IDOC denied due \nto “unsafe conditions.”  Id. ¶ 111.  Korszlak believes the denial was due to the pres-\nence of another sex offender in another room of the hotel.  Id. \n  During his incarceration, Korszlak has reached out to every transitional hous-\ning facility or rehabilitation organization he can find in Illinois, which totals 95.  Id. \n¶ 112.  All these institutions either ignored Korszlak or declined his requests because \nof  his  sex  offender  status.    Id.    Korszlak  went  even  further,  submitting  an \nPage 20 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 21 of 61 PageID #:1526\nInternational Prisoner Transfer Request, applying for asylum, and trying to renounce \nhis American citizenship.  Id. ¶ 113.  All relevant decisionmakers rejected his ad-\nvances.  Id. \n  Kevin Rogers \n  Kevin Rogers is currently incarcerated at Robinson Correctional Center.  Id. \n¶ 115.  A court convicted him of criminal sexual assault and therefore sentenced him \nto ten years’ imprisonment (at 85%) in 2008.  Id.  Rogers has been eligible to serve \nhis MSR term on the outside since February 2018.  Id.  Rogers is single and has no \nsavings or substantial assets.  Id. ¶ 116.  Rogers has attempted to secure a compliant \nhost site but has not been successful.  Id. ¶ 117.  The IDOC denied his mother’s home \nbecause it was 325 feet from a park.  Id.  It rejected another address because Rogers’ \nvictim—the host’s daughter—frequents the home, in addition to the following facts: \nthe host refused to allow the agent to enter the home, there was no landline phone, \nand the host site was a health hazard.  Id. \n  The Department denied Rogers’ girlfriend’s home because there were chil-\ndren’s toys there and the agent advised the host that the home could be approved \nafter the host removed them.  Id.  The IDOC denied Rogers’ friend’s home because \nthere were firearms in the house that the host was unwilling to remove, the host’s \nfive-month-old granddaughter frequently visited the home, the host had a smart \nphone, and Rogers failed to divulge to the host that he was a sex offender.  Id.  Finally, \nthe Missouri Department of Corrections rejected his discretionary transfer.  Id.  Rog-\ners’ counselor informed him that there are no halfway houses in Illinois that accept \nPage 21 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 22 of 61 PageID #:1527\nsex offenders on MSR.  Id. ¶ 118.  Still, Rogers has reached out to many organizations \nbut has never received a response.  Id.  Different treatment centers denied him, too.  \nId.  Rogers has no friends that can help through this process.  Id. ¶ 119. \n  John Michael Cichon \n  John Michael Cichon is presently imprisoned at Graham Correctional Center.  \nId. ¶ 120.  In 2011, a court convicted him of child pornography and sentenced him to \n180 days’ incarceration and two years of probation.  Id.  A court revoked that sentence \nin 2012 and sentenced him to four years in the IDOC with a two-year MSR term.  Id.  \nThat MSR term later changed to three years to life, which Cichon has been eligible \nto serve since November 2013.  Id.  Cichon has little to no savings and income.  Id. \n¶ 121.  He has not submitted potential addresses for host sites because he is certain \nthat the Department will deny all of them due to the presence of children or internet \naccess.  Id. ¶ 122.  Cichon attempted to secure apartment leases on his own, but an \nIDOC agent informed him that he is not able to enter into leases or contracts on his \nown behalf during his incarceration.  Id. ¶ 123.  In other words, someone else must \nlease the apartment or home for him.  Id.  Of the several halfway houses he and his \nfamily contacted, none are open to sex offenders.  Id. ¶ 124. \n  Antoine Darnell Lamb \n  Antoine Darnell Lamb is currently incarcerated at Taylorville Correctional \nCenter.  Id. ¶ 125.  A court convicted him of criminal sexual assault with the use of \nforce in 2010 and then sentenced him to seven years’ imprisonment with an MSR \nterm of three years to life.  Id.  Lamb became eligible for MSR in April 2015.  Id.  \nPage 22 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 23 of 61 PageID #:1528\nLamb has no assets or money to his name.  Id. ¶ 126.  Lamb tried to submit a handful \nof addresses, but the IDOC denied all of them.  Id. ¶ 127.  The Department rejected \nthe first because of two day care centers and a park within 500 feet of the address; \nthe second because there was another registered child sex offender living there; the \nthird because there was a licensed day care center within 500 feet of the proposed \nsite; the fourth the Iowa Department of Corrections denied because it violated Iowa’s \n2,000-foot restriction; and the fifth the Illinois DOC rejected because its owner is a \nchild sex offender and it was also within 500 feet of a licensed day care center.  Id.  \nLamb has no family or friends that can help him.  Id.  Lamb has been unable to find \nany halfway houses, religious organizations, or support groups to house him.  Id. \n¶ 128. \n  Nicole Juanita Uhlir \n  Nicole Juanita Uhlir is presently imprisoned at Logan Correctional Center.  Id. \n¶ 129.  In 2006, a court convicted her of predatory criminal sexual assault and sen-\ntenced her to six years’ (at 85%) incarceration with a three-to-life MSR term.  Id.  \nAlthough Uhlir has served MSR terms twice, she has violated the rules both times.  \nId.  Uhlir is single and has little to no income, leaving her with no way to pay for her \nown housing.  Id. ¶ 130.  Uhlir was initially residing with a friend while on MSR, but \nthe IDOC now deems that address unsuitable for her.  Id. ¶ 131.  Her parole agent \nhas never explained to Uhlir why the home is noncompliant.  Id.  According to the \nDepartment, Uhlir’s friend allowed her to violate the rules by making prohibited \nitems, including a smartphone, available to her.  Id.  The IDOC denied the other \nPage 23 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 24 of 61 PageID #:1529\naddress Uhlir submitted because there is a soccer field within 195 feet of the site.  Id. \n¶ 132.  Uhlir has no family or friends to turn to and stated that she felt indefinitely \ntrapped.  Id. ¶ 133.  The IDOC released Uhlir in December 2018 and has required her \nto wear a GPS ankle monitor in addition to the “beacon” device in her home.  (Dkt. \n108 ¶ 143.) \nGPS Monitoring \n  Wisconsin, unlike Illinois, provides parole agents with directions about how to \nsupervise and manage homeless sex offenders.  Id. ¶136.  The Wisconsin DOC sub-\njects homeless parolees to special restrictions, including GPS monitoring.  Id. ¶ 137.  \nUnder that restriction, the individuals on release must “‘remain in the county of su-\npervision, unless an exception is granted for employment, offense related program-\nming, or other pre-approved activities.’”  Id.  They also “‘must call and speak with the \n[parole] agent at least once every seven days, on a weekday, to report . . . the loca-\ntion(s) in the city where he/she has been frequenting and sleeping for the past seven \ndays and plans to frequent/or sleep for the next seven days.’”  Id. \n  The Illinois DOC, for its part, has been using GPS to monitor people on MSR \nfor more than ten years.  Id. ¶ 138.  The system tracks offenders’ whereabouts, their \nmovement, how long they remain in any location, and the precise time of their move-\nment.  Id. ¶ 139.  It additionally sends parole agents an immediate alert when a pa-\nrolee enters an exclusion zone—somewhere the agent does not permit the person to \nbe—or an inclusion zone, wherever the agent specifies that the offender should be at \na specific time, like a job or appointment.  Id.  The agent can use a computer to see \nPage 24 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 25 of 61 PageID #:1530\nwhere the offender is at any given time and review stored location data.  Id.  The \nparties dispute whether GPS and electronic monitoring are duplicative of each other \nand truly necessary (for example, to monitor a parolee when he or she is home).  (Dkt. \n107 ¶ 19.)  The parties further dispute whether a well-used GPS monitoring system \nis enough standing alone to monitor homeless sex offenders, or whether additional \nparole agents and resources are necessary.  Id. ¶ 21. \n  The defendants’ representative testified that using this GPS system to track \nsex offenders is “‘not a good fit.’”  (Dkt. 88 ¶ 140.)  He also stated that using GPS to \nmonitor these individuals would be a “‘huge public safety risk’” because the offender \nwould not have a defined place to be or a purpose for his or her actions, defeating the \npurpose of MSR.  Id.  The witness asserted being homeless would place a sex offender \nat greater risk of being blamed for other crimes.  Id.  That said, the IDOC releases \nother convicted felons (including murderers and violent criminals) into homelessness \nto serve their MSR terms so long as they do not have electronic monitoring as a con-\ndition of that term.  Id. ¶ 141; Dkt. 107 ¶ 18.  The witness did not identify any prob-\nlems supervising those parolees.  Dkt. 107 ¶ 18. \n  There are examples in the record of the IDOC’s use of GPS to monitor sex of-\nfenders.  For instance, a court convicted Jason Tucker of predatory criminal sexual \nassault in 2011 and sentenced him to seven years in prison (at 85%), plus an MSR \nterm of three years to life.  (Dkt. 128 ¶ 143.)  Since moving from prison to MSR in \n2017, the IDOC has always required Tucker to wear a GPS ankle monitor.  Id.  Taking \nanother example, Nicole Uhlir is currently on MSR for predatory criminal sexual \nPage 25 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 26 of 61 PageID #:1531\nassault of a child, and she wears a GPS ankle monitor on top of the “beacon” device \nin her home.  Id. ¶ 144. \n  Further illustrations abound, including Jennifer Tyree, Michael DiMichele, \nBill Carney, and Robin Frazier, all sex offenders who the IDOC requires to wear GPS \nmonitors.  Id. ¶¶ 145–47, 149.  Many also have beacon monitors in their homes.  Id. \n¶¶ 145–47.  The technology allows parole agents to keep an eye on the individuals, \nwhich one time prompted Tyree’s agent to ask her why she stopped at a Steak and \nShake on her way home from work.  Id. ¶ 145.  DiMichele’s ankle monitor tells him \nwhenever he enters a prohibited location or violates his approved movement.  Id. \n¶ 146. \n  According to the defendants, the goals of sex offender supervision, include \n“‘risk management,’ ‘prevent[ing] future victimization,’ and reduc[ing] recidivism,’ as \nwell as ‘providing effective treatment for sex offenders’ and ‘provid[ing] opportunities \nfor successful reintegration of the individual into the community and family.’”  Dkt. \n88 ¶ 142.  The average cost to the State of supervising a parolee on release in the \ncommunity is approximately $2,000/year, compared to $26,365/year to incarcerate a \nperson.  Id. ¶¶ 134–35. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \n  Summary judgment is proper when “the movant shows that there is no genuine \ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of \nlaw.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); see, e.g., Reed v. Columbia St. Mary’s Hosp., 915 F.3d 473, \n485 (7th Cir. 2019).  The parties genuinely dispute a material fact when “‘the evidence \nPage 26 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 27 of 61 PageID #:1532\nis such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.’”  \nDaugherty v. Page, 906 F.3d 606, 609–10 (7th Cir. 2018) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty \nLobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986)).  “Rule 56 ‘mandates the entry of summary \njudgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a party who \nfails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential \nto that party’s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.’”  \nZander v. Orlich, 907 F.3d 956, 959 (7th Cir. 2018) (quoting Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, \n477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986)).  In reviewing cross-motions for summary judgment, the \nCourt “‘construe[s] all inferences in favor of the party against whom the motion under \nconsideration is made.’”  Med. Protective Co. of Fort Wayne, Indiana v. Am. Int’l Spe-\ncialty Lines Ins. Co., 911 F.3d 438, 445 (7th Cir. 2018), reh’g denied (Jan. 29, 2019) \n(quoting Schlaf v. Safeguard Prop., LLC, 899 F.3d 459, 465 (7th Cir. 2018)). \nANALYSIS \n  The plaintiff class members moved for summary judgment on four grounds, \narguing that the challenged scheme violates: (1) substantive due process (Count I); \n(2) equal protection (Count II); (3) procedural due process (Count III); and (4) the \nEighth Amendment (Count IV).  Before diving into the merits of these constitutional \nclaims, the parties briefed two preliminary issues that must be addressed: first, \nwhether a petition for a writ of habeas corpus or an independent civil rights suit un-\nder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 is the proper vehicle; and second, whether the Court should \napply strict scrutiny or rational basis review in its evaluation of the claims. \nPage 27 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 28 of 61 PageID #:1533\nI.  § 1983 vs. § 2254 \n  Starting with the vehicle question, the defendants argue that the plaintiffs \nmust raise their constitutional claims in individual habeas corpus petitions.  The de-\nfendants contended as much when they moved to dismiss, and the Court denied their \nmotion on this ground.  (Dkt. 31 at 10–13.)  In so ruling, the Court reasoned that \n“Plaintiffs do not claim ‘entitlement’ to parole or MSR.  Plaintiffs claim entitlement \nto a constitutional process in determining whether they will be released on MSR, not \nto release on MSR . . . Plaintiffs do not claim a right to release but instead that offi-\ncials are using unconstitutional rules.”  Id. at 13.  The defendants invited reconsider-\nation of this ruling on their motion for summary judgment; the Court again rejects \ntheir advance. \n  As understood earlier, the plaintiffs’ case is about fair procedure and not re-\nlease from incarceration, although as a remedial matter they might end up there.  \n“[W]hen a state prisoner seeks damages in a § 1983 suit, the district court must con-\nsider whether a judgment in [his] favor . . . would necessarily imply the invalidity of \nhis conviction or sentence.”  Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 487 (1994); see Morgan \nv. Schott, 914 F.3d 1115, 1117, 1121 (7th Cir. 2019).  Here, the plaintiffs are neither \nchallenging their sex-crimes convictions nor their sentences, which include their MSR \nterms of three years to life.  Put a little differently, the plaintiffs do not seek to inval-\nidate the fact or duration of their confinement.  Rather, they seek to change the pro-\ncesses used in determining the penultimate condition of their confinement—location. \nPage 28 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 29 of 61 PageID #:1534\n  In Wilkinson v. Dotson, the Supreme Court held that a civil rights plaintiff may \nseek a constitutional change in the parole procedures used to adjudicate his confine-\nment status.  544 U.S. 74, 82 (2005).   The Court reasoned that, because neither pris-\noner sought an injunction ordering his immediate or speedier release into the com-\nmunity, a remedy in their favor would mean at most new eligibility for review.  Id.  \nThat might have sped up the consideration of their release, but it did not automati-\ncally follow that that the inmates would in fact be released.  Id.  The Court analyzed \nHeck’s use of the word “sentence” to mean not prison procedures, but “substantive \ndeterminations as to the length of confinement.”  Id. at 83.  That led to the conclusion \nthat prisoners may bring § 1983 challenges to prison administrative decisions.  Id. at \n84. \n  The Seventh Circuit has followed suit.  See Henderson v. Bryant, 606 F. App’x \n301, 304 (7th Cir. 2015); Burd v. Sessler, 702 F.3d 429, 433 (7th Cir. 2012); Adams v. \nBledsoe, 173 F. App’x 483, 484 (7th Cir. 2006); Bunn v. Conley, 309 F.3d 1002, 1007–\n08 (7th Cir. 2002); Isby v. Newkirk, 105 F.3d 660, at *1 (7th Cir. 1996) (nonpreceden-\ntial disposition); Falcon v. U.S. Bureau of Prisons, 52 F.3d 137, 138–39 (7th Cir. 1995).  \nIt is the defendants’ position that the plaintiffs are challenging a condition of their \nconfinement because they are “seeking a different program or location or environ-\nment,” turning the question into whether what they ask for amounts to a “quantum \nchange in the level of custody.”  Graham v. Broglin, 922 F.2d 379, 381 (7th Cir. 1991).  \nBeginning in Graham, the Court of Appeals recognized that “[t]he difficult interme-\ndiate case is where the prisoner is seeking not earlier freedom, but transfer from a \nPage 29 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 30 of 61 PageID #:1535\nmore to a less restrictive form of custody.”  Id.  The critical distinction from that work-\nrelease case to this one is that here, unlike there, the plaintiffs are not claiming en-\ntitlement to release.  See id.   \n  Instead, the plaintiffs in this case dispute the procedures used in host site re-\nview.  As in Richmond v. Scibana, the wrong perspective to take is “to . . . question \nwhether differences between . . . prison . . . and community confinement are suffi-\nciently great that [the plaintiffs] can be deemed to challenge the fact of custody, ra-\nther than simply conditions of confinement acknowledged to be lawful.”  387 F.3d 602, \n605 (7th Cir. 2004) (citations omitted).  A favorable result for the plaintiffs in this \nlitigation would not entitle them: \nto any change in the duration or even the location of [their] confinement.  \nA judge could do no more than determine the extent of the [Depart-\nment’s] discretion to make placement decisions; the substance of any \neventual decision is not at issue.  Parole litigation supplies a helpful \nanalogy: a prisoner claiming a right to release on parole must use § 2241 \n(or § 2254 for a state prisoner); but a prisoner claiming that parole offi-\ncials are apt to use incorrect rules when resolving a future application \nmust use the APA (or 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for a state prisoner). \n \nId. (citing White v. Henman, 977 F.2d 292 (7th Cir. 1992); Clark v. Thompson, 960 \nF.2d 663 (7th Cir. 1992); Walker v. Prisoner Review Board, 694 F.2d 499 (7th Cir. \n1982)). \n  The statutory scheme here “in no way affects the duration, much less the fact, \nof confinement.  [Their] supervised release will still be in place, and it will last just \nas long.”  Bunn, 309 F.3d at 1008.  Accordingly, a straightforward application of Rich-\nmond carries the day.  “[A] challenge to rules that affect placement in community \nconfinement [shall be treated] the same way as rules that affect placement in parole \nPage 30 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 31 of 61 PageID #:1536\nsystems.”  Richmond, 387 F.3d at 606.  The defendants were wrong to frame the ques-\ntion as prison versus supervised release, but even if they were right, the plaintiffs’ \nclaims nonetheless land in § 1983’s net.  See Moran v. Sondalle, 218 F.3d 647, 650, \n652 (7th Cir. 2000) (explaining that prisoners who do not demand early release and \nalternatively contest the procedures used to make those determinations must use \n§ 1983 as their vehicle of choice).  The plaintiffs have been consistent since day one \nin not directly requesting release but asking for a constitutional application of the \nrelevant law and policy to their situations.  (Dkt. 1 at 27–29, 33–34.)  Thus, the plain-\ntiffs properly brought their claims under § 1983. \nII.  Scrutiny \n  The parties next disagree on which level of judicial scrutiny governs the plain-\ntiffs’ constitutional claims.  On the one hand, the defendants argue that the Court \nshould apply Turner v. Safley, which holds that “when a prison regulation impinges \non inmates’ constitutional rights, the regulation is valid if it is reasonably related to \nlegitimate penological interests.”  482 U.S. 78, 89 (1987).  On the other hand, the \nplaintiffs contend that Johnson v. California controls, which refused to extend Turner \nto a racial segregation policy in the prison context because strict scrutiny applies to \nall racial classifications.  543 U.S. 499, 515 (2005).  Because the plaintiffs here are in \neffect asserting their rights as releasees and not prisoners, the question becomes \nwhether Turner extends from prison administration to the supervised release appa-\nratus. \nPage 31 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 32 of 61 PageID #:1537\nAlthough circuit precedent is scant, the Court of Appeals has touched on the \nissue in two separate decisions.  First, in Felce v. Fiedler, the court considered a Wis-\nconsin inmate’s procedural due process challenge to the parole committee’s decision \nto condition his release on the receipt of antipsychotic drug injections.  See 974 F.2d \n1484, 1486–88 (7th Cir. 1992).  Recognizing that it was analyzing a parole situation \nand not a prison situation, the court did not doubt that Turner’s standard applied.  \nSee id. at 1494.  To be sure, Turner was a substantive due process case, however that \ndid not affect the Felce court’s evaluation of the procedural due process claim alleged \nby the prisoner there.  Second, in Williams v. Wisconsin, the court in passing hinted \nthat Turner’s recognition of prisoners’ fundamental right to marry would necessarily \nextend to parolees and thus the state may only limit it for sound penological reasons.  \nSee 336 F.3d 576, 582 (7th Cir. 2003).  It just so happens that, in Williams, no one \nhad forbidden the parolee from marrying; instead, the state had affected the timing \nand location of his plans.  See id.  So, although Turner was relevant, it was not dis-\npositive. \n  This seeming extension of Turner from prison to parole makes sense in view of \nthe Supreme Court’s admonition that the Turner test applies whenever constitutional \nrights and prison administration butt up against one another.  In Washington v. Har-\nper, the Court explained that: \nThese two principles apply in all cases in which a prisoner asserts that \na prison regulation violates the Constitution, not just those in which the \nprisoner invokes the First Amendment. We made quite clear that the \nstandard of review we adopted in Turner applies to all circumstances in \nwhich the needs of prison administration implicate constitutional rights. \n \nPage 32 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 33 of 61 PageID #:1538\n494 U.S. 210, 224 (1990) (citations omitted) (emphasis added); see Russell v. Richards, \n384 F.3d 444, 447 (7th Cir. 2004). \n  Johnson v. California, then, does not get the plaintiffs home.  In that case, the \nSupreme Court declined to expand Turner to cover racial classifications, reasoning \nthat it applies the reasonable-relationship test “only to rights that are ‘inconsistent \nwith proper incarceration.’”  543 U.S. 499, 510 (2005) (emphasis in original) (quoting \nOverton v. Bazzetta, 539 U.S. 126, 131 (2003); then citing Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. \n817, 822 (1974) (“[A] prison inmate retains those First Amendment rights that are \nnot inconsistent with his status as a prisoner or with the legitimate penological ob-\njectives of the corrections system”)).  The Court clarified that “certain privileges and \nrights must necessarily be limited in the prison context.”  Id. (citations omitted).  That \nis why Turner does so much work in First Amendment cases, and relevant here, with \nsome due process claims.  See id.  Racial discrimination is of an entirely different \nmold because eradicating it is consistent with appropriate prison management and \ntherefore need not be undermined in that context. \n  In this case, however, the liberty interests that the plaintiffs allege the defend-\nants are depriving them of are “susceptible to the logic of Turner . . . because [they \nare] . . . right[s] that need necessarily be compromised for the sake of proper prison \nadministration.”  Id. at 510.  The whole point of the varying forms of custody at issue \nin these cases—incarceration, parole, probation, supervised release—is to restrict the \nliberty of individuals convicted of crimes.  Custody determinations, to the extent they \nfall within the ambit of the Fourteenth Amendment, come under the scope of Turner \nPage 33 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 34 of 61 PageID #:1539\nbecause they lie at the core of running a correctional system.  Cf. Jones v. Walker, 358 \nF. App’x 708, 711 (7th Cir. 2009) (choosing not to use Johnson for allegations of racial \nsegregation that result from facially neutral prison safety policies); McClain v. Rog-\ners, 155 F. App’x 918, 920 (7th Cir. 2005) (same). \n  That said, the Court was explicit in Johnson that it has “not used Turner to \nevaluate Eighth Amendment claims of cruel and unusual punishment in prison.  We \njudge violations of that Amendment under the ‘deliberate indifference’ standard, ra-\nther than Turner’s “reasonably related” standard.”  543 U.S. at 511 (citing Hope v. \nPelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 738 (2002) (quoting source omitted)).  The Court stated this was \n“because the integrity of the criminal justice system depends on full compliance with \nthe Eighth Amendment.”  Id. (citing Spain v. Procunier, 600 F.2d 189, 193–94 (9th \nCir. 1979) (Kennedy, J.)); see Norwood v. Vance, 591 F.3d 1062, 1074 (9th Cir. 2010). \n  Implementing these rules here streamlines the foregoing discussion of stand-\nard of review: The Court will use Turner to assess the plaintiffs’ procedural due pro-\ncess (e.g. Felce) and equal protection claims but not their Eighth Amendment claim.  \nWith respect to the class members’ substantive due process claim, however, the Court \nconcludes that it is duplicative of the Eighth Amendment claim.  Both constitutional \nprovisions regulate the government’s authority to confine a person, they just come \ninto play at different times.  For instance, the Fourteenth Amendment covers pretrial \ndetainees, while the Eighth Amendment houses posttrial convicts.  See Kingsley v. \nHendrickson, 135 S. Ct. 2466, 2475 (2015) (citations omitted). \nPage 34 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 35 of 61 PageID #:1540\n  Although it is uncertain “which amendment controls for hybrid forms of deten-\ntion, . . . the Eighth Amendment standard . . . is at least as difficult for a plaintiff to \nsatisfy as the Fourteenth Amendment standard.”  Estate of Clark v. Walker, 865 F.3d \n544, 546 n.1 (7th Cir. 2017), cert. denied, 138 S. Ct. 1285 (2018) (concerning extended \nsupervision in Wisconsin) (citing Cavalieri v. Shepard, 321 F.3d 616, 620 (7th Cir. \n2003) (“as a pretrial detainee, [plaintiff] was entitled to at least the same protection \nagainst deliberate indifference to his basic needs as is available to convicted prisoners \nunder the Eighth Amendment ”) (additional source omitted)); see, e.g., Miller v.

Ohio Mar. 26, 2007) \n(collecting cases that used the Fourth Amendment’s objective reasonableness stand-\nard to evaluate parolee/releasee’s excessive force claims). \n  Both the Eighth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment claims get at the \nsame issue: whether the state unconstitutionally deprived the plaintiffs of their lib-\nerty by keeping them in prison, instead of supervising them on release, because they \nare indigent and homeless.  This is a total conceptual overlap, and one the Seventh \nCircuit appears to treat as governed by the Eighth Amendment.  See Courtney v. But-\nler, No. 17-3310, 2019 WL 718888, at *1 (7th Cir.

Peters, \n256 F.3d 695, 700 (7th Cir. 2001). \n  Keeping that in mind, the Court heeds the Justices’ admonition that “[w]here \na particular Amendment ‘provides an explicit textual source of constitutional protec-\ntion’ against a particular sort of government behavior, ‘that Amendment, not the \nmore generalized notion of ‘substantive due process,’ must be the guide for analyzing \nthese claims.’”  Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 273 (1994) (citing Graham v. Connor, \n490 U.S. 386, 395 (1989)); see Graham, 490 U.S. at 395 n.10 (“After conviction, the \nEighth Amendment ‘serves as the primary source of substantive protection . . . Any \nprotection that ‘substantive due process’ affords convicted prisoners against excessive \nforce is, we have held, at best redundant of that provided by the Eighth Amendment.”) \n(citing Whitley v. Albers, 475 U.S. 312, 327 (1986)); see also Cty. of Sacramento v. \nLewis, 523 U.S. 833, 842 (1998).  Because of this analytical redundancy, the Court \nwill proceed under the Eighth Amendment and not the Fourteenth. \nII.  Equal Protection (Count II) \n  The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the gov-\nernment from treating similarly situated persons differently.  “Prisoners do not sur-\nrender their rights to equal protection at the prison gate.  Unequal treatment among \ninmates, however, is justified if it bears a rational relation to legitimate penal inter-\nest.”  Williams v. Lane, 851 F.2d 867, 881 (7th Cir. 1988) (citing Hudson v. Palmer, \nPage 36 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 37 of 61 PageID #:1542\n468 U.S. 517, 522–23 (1984)); see Kramer v. Pollard, 497 F. App’x 639, 642–43 (7th \nCir. 2012); Stojanovic v. Humphreys, 309 F. App’x 48, 52 (7th Cir. 2009) (“Prisoners \nretain their right to equal protection”); Aruanno v. Corzine, 687 F. App’x 226, 230 (3d \nCir. 2017), cert. dismissed sub nom. Aruanno v. Christie, 138 S. Ct. 235 (2017); Har-\nrington v. Scribner, 785 F.3d 1299, 1308 (9th Cir. 2015) (noting penological interests \nstill factor into the analysis of an equal protection claim). \nThe Seventh Circuit has consistently applied the Equal Protection Clause to \nvarying custodial levels in the correctional context.  See, e.g., Taylor v. Edgar, 52 F. \nApp’x 825, 826–27 (7th Cir. 2002); May v. Sheahan, 226 F.3d 876, 882–83 (7th Cir. \n2000); Beatty v. DeBruyn, 77 F.3d 484 (7th Cir. 1996); Hatch v. Sharp, 919 F.2d 1266, \n1268–69 (7th Cir. 1990); Doyle v. Elsea, 658 F.2d 512, 517–19 (7th Cir. 1981); Faye v. \nGray, 541 F.2d 665, 667–68 (7th Cir. 1976).  While a prisoner’s indigence does not \ngenerally call for equal protection analysis, the Supreme Court has at least twice \ninvalidated facially neutral criminal laws that authorized the detention of poor indi-\nviduals because of their indigence.  See Tate v. Short, 401 U.S. 395, 397–99 (1971); \nWilliams v. Illinois, 399 U.S. 235, 241–42 (1970); see also ODonnell v. Harris Cty., \n892 F.3d 147, 161–62 (5th Cir. 2018); Walker v. City of Calhoun, GA, 901 F.3d 1245, \n1259–60 (11th Cir. 2018) (analyzing equal protection claim of pretrial indigent de-\ntainees). \nThe plaintiffs argue that the defendants are denying them equal protection of \nthe law because, but for their indigency, the plaintiffs would be able to pay for their \nown housing and serve their MSR terms in the community.  In other words, the \nPage 37 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 38 of 61 PageID #:1543\nstatutory and regulatory scheme as-applied to sex offenders with three-to-life MSR \nterms treats those who are wealthy different from those who are poor.  The defend-\nants contend that they are not requiring the plaintiffs to pay for anything (like a fine) \nto secure their release.  Ultimately, assert the defendants, the IDOC’s requirement \nthat sex offenders have a stable host site is rationally related to protecting the public, \nespecially children. \nContrary to the defendants’ statements, the proper way to frame the question \nis as follows: whether indigent sex-offense releasees in Illinois remain incarcerated \nwhen similarly situated wealthy sex-offense releasees are not solely because the in-\ndigent releasees cannot afford to pay for housing outside of prison.  See State v. Ad-\nams, 91 So. 3d 724, 741–42 (Ala. Crim. App. 2010) (scrutinizing homeless and indi-\ngent offenders’ as-applied challenge to entire statutory scheme that required an adult \ncriminal sex offender to provide the state DOC with the address where he will reside \nupon release at least 45 days prior to the offender’s release from custody); see gener-\nally, e.g., McGinnis v. Royster, 410 U.S. 263 (1973) (considering as-applied challenge \nto entire statutory scheme and focusing on those prisoners unable to afford bail).  The \nstate’s treatment of the indigent and the non-indigent must be categorically different, \nand indeed, worse.  See Walker, 901 F.3d at 12560. \nHere, those sex offenders who are indigent and homeless continue to be incar-\ncerated upon completion of their court-ordered terms of imprisonment, while those \nsex offenders who are neither indigent nor homeless are released into the community.  \nThis application of the statutory scheme discriminates against the plaintiffs because \nPage 38 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 39 of 61 PageID #:1544\nof their poverty.  The undisputed record demonstrates that the class members are \nadult criminal sex offenders who have completed their terms of imprisonment and \nattempted to comply with the requirements imposed upon them in securing a host \nsite.  Because they are indigent and homeless, however, the plaintiffs have been—\nand still are—incapable of doing so.  The fact that the defendants are not requiring \nthe plaintiffs to pay them via a fine, but rather a third-party (potentially a landlord), \nis entirely beside the point because the defendants still require the defendants to \nhave money and financial support to get out of prison. \nBy way of example, J.D. Lindenmeier completed the term of incarceration that \nthe trial court ordered him to serve for the commission of his original sex crime (one \ncount of predatory criminal assault of a child) in 2011, which is when the PRB ap-\nproved him for release.  (Dkt. 91 ¶ 63.)  His continued imprisonment is not the result \nof the underlying offense but is instead the consequence of his indigency, homeless-\nness, and the attendant powerlessness to procure housing that will satisfy the IDOC.  \nId. ¶¶ 69–70.  Lindenmeier’s incarceration, then, is for reasons completely beyond his \ncontrol.  Looking at another instance, Stanley Meyer completed his term of imprison-\nment for his original sex crime (one count of criminal sexual assault) in 2011, when \nthe PRB approved him for release.  Id. ¶¶ 71–73.  He, too, remains incarcerated—not \nas a consequence of the underlying offense but because he is indigent and homeless, \nleaving him unable to identify a host site.  Id. ¶¶ 74–75. \nOn its face, the statutes and regulations equally apply to all convicted sex of-\nfenders by mandating a stable host site that satisfies all associated requirements.  \nPage 39 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 40 of 61 PageID #:1545\nThe scheme does not facially classify offenders, and upon completion of the court-\nordered term of imprisonment, all sex offenders can theoretically regain their liberty \nby providing an address that meets all obligations.  As applied, however, the oppor-\ntunity for an indigent and homeless sex offender to procure release from confinement \nfollowing completion of incarceration is virtually nonexistent.  As the undisputed and \nmaterial evidence demonstrates, only those sex offenders with access to funds to pay \nfor their own accommodations at an approved location will be free from incarceration. \nIndigents without the resources to pay for lodging will remain in prison indef-\ninitely.  Id. ¶ 38 (“‘Q: Is it possible for a sex offender with an indeterminate MSR term \nwho, A, does not have money to pay for his own housing, and, B, does not have family \nor friends on the outside who can pay for his housing [whether by living with them or \npaying for separate accommodations] to ever get out of the Illinois Department of \nCorrections? A: Never say never, but, . . . using those criteria, no.’”).  This confinement \nis potentially endless for the indigent and homeless sex offender solely because he or \nshe has no money to secure a place to stay when imprisonment ends and mandatory \nsupervised release (supposedly) begins. \nThe defendants have created separate consequences for indigent, homeless sex \noffenders and for non-indigent, non-homeless sex offenders.  Only those who have no \nfinancial resources suffer a continued deprivation of liberty following the completion \nof their court-ordered term of incarceration for the original sex offense.  The defend-\nants are punishing the plaintiffs for their indigency and homelessness, matters to-\ntally beyond their control.  The defendants are therefore wrong to argue that the \nPage 40 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 41 of 61 PageID #:1546\nIDOC’s requirement that sex offenders have a stable host site (applied collectively \nthrough statute, regulation, and policy) is rationally related to protecting the public, \nespecially children.  The right pivot point in the equal protection context is whether \nthe government’s separate and discriminatory treatment of similarly situated indi-\nviduals rationally relates to a legitimate penological interest. \nIn this case, the defendants’ application of the laws to keep indigent and home-\nless sex offenders locked up (while non-indigent sex offenders roam free) has no rea-\nsonable relation to public protection.  Quite the contrary, “the condition at issue \nhere—indigency—is itself no threat to the safety or welfare of society.”  Bearden v. \nGeorgia, 461 U.S. 660, 669 n. 9 (1983).  There is no meaningful penological distinction \nbetween indigent and non-indigent sex offenders: the state’s public safety objective is \nconstant.  A homeless and indigent sex offender is presumably as dangerous to the \ncommunity as one who is capable of paying for his own lodging.  That wraps up the \nfirst Turner factor, and turning to the others, they also weigh in favor of invalidation \nof this practice.  See Stojanovic, 309 F. App’x at 51. \nThere are not alternative means of exercising the right (here, liberty) notwith-\nstanding the policy—the defendants’ present application of the rules and regulations \ndeprives sex offenders of their conditional liberty on mandatory supervised release.  \nPerhaps the defendants could relax some MSR requirements that do not implicate \nwealth, but that is hard to imagine on the record as it stands now.  Even assuming \nthat factor tilted toward the defendants, the other two do not.  The impact that ac-\ncommodating the right will have on prison resources is actually a positive one.  (Dkt. \nPage 41 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 42 of 61 PageID #:1547\n88 ¶¶ 134–35 (agreeing that the average cost to the State of supervising a parolee on \nrelease in the community is approximately $2,000/year, compared to $26,365/year to \nincarcerate a person).) \nThere are alternatives to the policy.  The Court is of course aware that the \nintent of the Illinois Legislature, public safety, is a compelling state interest.  The \nmanner in which the defendants are administering the enacted corrective framework, \nhowever, unconstitutionally subjects indigent, homeless sex offenders to a loss of lib-\nerty for the solitary reason that they cannot afford rent.  The defendants are capable \nof utilizing constitutional methods to effectuate the legislative purpose. \nFor instance, the defendants may demand that a determination be made in \nevery case whether an offender made efforts to comply with the statute and failed to \ndo so only because he or she was indigent.  This is a process endorsed by the Supreme \nCourt in Bearden, from which the defendants may take their cue.  See 461 U.S. at \n668–69, 72–73.  An extension of that rule here would require the defendants to “con-\nsider alternate measures of punishment other than imprisonment. Only if alternate \nmeasures are not adequate to meet the State’s interests in punishment and deter-\nrence may the state imprison a releasee who has made sufficient bona fide efforts to \npay.”  Id. at 672.   \nMoreover, the defendants are fully capable of monitoring and tracking home-\nless sex offenders.  The legislatures of other states have provided the statutory means \nto record the whereabouts of homeless sex offenders.  See Adams, 91 So. 3d at 742–\n44.  In fact, so has Illinois: \nPage 42 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 43 of 61 PageID #:1548\nFor purposes of this Article, the place of residence or temporary domicile \nis defined as any and all places where the sex offender resides for an \naggregate period of time of 3 or more days during any calendar year.  \nAny person required to register under this Article who lacks a fixed ad-\ndress or temporary domicile must notify, in person, the agency of juris-\ndiction of his or her last known address within 3 days after ceasing to \nhave a fixed residence. \n \nA sex offender or sexual predator who is temporarily absent from his or \nher current address of registration for 3 or more days shall notify the \nlaw enforcement agency having jurisdiction of his or her current regis-\ntration, including the itinerary for travel, in the manner provided in Sec-\ntion 6 of this Act for notification to the law enforcement agency having \njurisdiction of change of address. \n \nAny person who lacks a fixed residence must report weekly, in person, \nwith the sheriff's office of the county in which he or she is located in an \nunincorporated area, or with the chief of police in the municipality in \nwhich he or she is located.  The agency of jurisdiction will document each \nweekly registration to include all the locations where the person has \nstayed during the past 7 days. \n \n730 ILCS 150/3 (emphasis added); see 730 ILCS 5/3–3–7(a)(7.7) (mandating that cer-\ntain sex offenders wear an approved electronic monitoring device); 730 ILCS 5/5-8A-\n3(g) (requiring some sex offenders to participate in an electronic home detention pro-\ngram for at least the first two years of their indeterminate MSR terms).  The Illinois \nLegislature, then, anticipated and prepared for some sex offenders to be homeless.  \nCf. People v. Wlecke, 2014 IL App (1st) 112467, ¶ 31 (“This court . . . recognized that \nunder the Act, ‘[a] person can be homeless by any normal standards and still have a \n‘fixed residence’ if he or she has an occasional but predictable place to stay.’”). \n  For good reason, too, because in reality law enforcement supervises many \nhomeless sex offenders on release.  See, e.g., Regains v. City of Chicago, No. 15-2444, \n2019 WL 1147602, at *1–*2 (7th Cir. Mar. 13, 2019) (indicating that in a handful of \nPage 43 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 44 of 61 PageID #:1549\ninstances the sex offender registration form used by law enforcement listed releasees’ \naddresses as “homeless,” and as to the type of registration, officers checked a box for \n“homeless weekly”); Beley v. City of Chicago, 901 F.3d 823, 824–27 (7th Cir. 2018) \n(same); People v. Scott, 2017 IL App (4th) 150529, ¶¶ 7–8, appeal denied, 95 N.E.3d \n484 (Ill. 2018) (same). \nUndisputed evidence in this record establishes that the IDOC has been using \nGPS technology for over ten years.  (Dkt. 91 ¶ 138.)  The Department already requires \nsex offenders on supervised release to wear a GPS ankle monitor, in addition to a \nlocation tracker installed in their homes.  (Dkt. 108 ¶¶ 138–39, 143; Dkt. 128 ¶¶ 143–\n47, 149.)  What is more, the IDOC has no problems supervising violent releasees, \nincluding murderers, who it regularly releases into homelessness.  Id. ¶ 141; Dkt. 107 \n¶ 18.  The technology seems to be working: one time, Jennifer Tyree’s parole agent \nasked her why she stopped at a Steak and Shake on her way home from work.  (Dkt. \n128 ¶ 145.)4 \nThis all makes sense after considering the Legislature’s purpose in establish-\ning mandatory supervised release: “facilitate[ing] reintegration back into society, a \npurpose distinct from serving time in prison.”  See Round v. Lamb, 2017 IL 122271, \n¶ 21 (citing 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a) (“indicating that the conditions of MSR ‘shall be such \nas the Prisoner Review Board deems necessary to assist the subject in leading a law-\n                                                 \n4 There are disputed facts in the record concerning electronic monitoring (not to mention \ninternet use); however, the Court views them as immaterial on summary judgment and not \nimplicated at this stage.  To be clear, that does not mean the practices are not problematic.  \nPerhaps the defendants will need to consider easing their confining exercise of discretion on \nthose conditions to comply with the Court’s order. \nPage 44 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 45 of 61 PageID #:1550\nabiding life’ and setting out a list of conditions for every parole and MSR that are \ndesigned for life outside of prison”); then citing 80th Ill. Gen. Assem., Senate Proceed-\nings, Nov. 22, 1977, at 98-99 (statements of Senator Graham) (“discussing the legis-\nlature’s intent to reduce recidivism and the benefit of maintaining custody over of-\nfenders for a period of time after they are released from prison”)). \nIf the defendants continue to not release offenders who are supposed to be on \nmandatory supervised release, then it must demonstrate how that accomplishes the \nLegislature’s goal of reintegrating the offenders into the community.  Because it is \nthe People’s representatives and their intent in passing laws that matter, not the \nIDOC’s and certainly not state or local police.  (Dkt. 91 ¶¶ 12–13 (agreeing that the \nIDOC essentially delegates its authority to interpret the statutes to the state and \nlocal police).)  To be sure, the IDOC does not write sex offender laws, but it does apply \nthem.  See id. ¶¶ 26, 50. \nIn exercising the discretion the Legislature entrusted it with, the IDOC must \nkeep in mind the Legislature’s central purpose of rehabilitation, which is evident \nthroughout the statutory scheme.  See 730 ILCS 5/3–14–2(b) (directing the IDOC to \nassign personnel to assist eligible individuals in preparing a parole plan and to report \ntheir efforts and findings to the PRB); 730 ILCS 5/3–14–3(1) (charging the IDOC with \nproviding employment counseling and job placement services and empowering it to \nadditionally assist in residential placement).  The Supreme Court of Illinois has au-\nthoritatively interpreted this statute to mean that “the entity directed with assisting \nan inmate with finding a suitable host site for MSR placement is the Department of \nPage 45 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 46 of 61 PageID #:1551\nCorrections,” and that “the Department of Corrections is directed to assist inmates \non MSR in finding residential placement, but is not directed to obtain residential \nplacement for those inmates.”  Cordrey v. Prisoner Review Bd., 2014 IL 117155, ¶ 24 \n(emphasis in original). \nThe Court recognizes that it has no warrant to dictate any alternative means \nto the defendants because it is entirely within their province to do so.  The IDOC is \nfree to develop whatever additional practices it wants to avoid the inadvertent wealth \nclassification it has created while still satisfying the goal of public safety.  The Court \nencourages the defendants to utilize their discretion to execute the Legislature’s pur-\npose in a constitutional manner that does not unfairly impact the indigent, homeless \nsex offenders who cannot by themselves obtain a host site upon the completion of \ntheir prison terms. \nThus, the way the defendants implement the statutory scheme here creates an \nillegal classification based on wealth, which indefinitely deprives the class members \nof their liberty as a result of their incapacity to pay.  Though not facially discrimina-\ntory, it is discriminatory in its application and accordingly violates the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the Constitution.  Cf. Adams, 91 So. 3d at 742 (citing Griffin v. Illinois, \n351 U.S. 12, 17 n.11 (1956)).  As a final word, the Court cautions that nothing in this \nopinion should be construed to entitle the plaintiffs to release—immediate or other-\nwise.  All this Court now holds is that the defendants are currently applying the stat-\nutory scheme in an unconstitutional fashion.  Any question of future propriety is not \nbefore the Court and one best saved for another day.  The Court grants the plaintiffs’ \nPage 46 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 47 of 61 PageID #:1552\nmotion for summary judgment (Dkt. 75) on their equal protection claim (Count II) \nand denies the defendants’ cross-motion (Dkt. 88). \nIII.  Procedural Due Process (Count III) \n  Moving to the plaintiffs’ next claim, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment bars the government from depriving an individual of life, liberty, or prop-\nerty without due process of law.  The procedural due process inquiry typically entails \ntwo steps: (1) whether the person has a protected life, liberty, or property interest; \nand (2) if so, what process is then due.  This Court follows the Seventh Circuit’s lead \nin approaching these claims in the correctional framework.  See Felce v. Fiedler, 974 \nF.2d 1484, 1488 (7th Cir. 1992).  First, courts must look to Turner v. Safley to define \nthe extent of the liberty interest where prison regulations impede on constitutional \nrights.  See id.; Johnson v. California, 543 U.S. 499, 510 (2005) (acknowledging that \nTurner applies to some due process claims).  Second, if the inmate has such a liberty \ninterest, courts must assess the constitutional sufficiency of the procedure used by \nemploying the test laid out in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 335 (1976).  See id. \n  Starting with substance, a cognizable liberty interest may arise from the Con-\nstitution, statutes, or regulations.  See Felce, 974 F.2d at 1488 (citations omitted); \nWilliams v. Lane, 851 F.2d 867, 879–80 (7th Cir. 1988) (collecting cases).  That said, \nthe Due Process Clause—standing alone—is not the source of the liberty interest in \nparole, or in this case, supervised release.  See Felce, 974 F.2d at 1489–90 (surveying \nthe Supreme Court’s due-process-in-parole jurisprudence, including Greenholtz v. In-\nmates of the Nebraska Penal and Correctional Complex, 442 U.S. 1 (1978); Morrissey \nPage 47 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 48 of 61 PageID #:1553\nv. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471 (1972); and Board of Pardons v. Allen, 482 U.S. 369 (1987)).  \nRather, “a state may create such an interest by state law.”  Id. at 1490.  If a state \ndoes so, “a person serving a sentence of probation or parole has a limited liberty in-\nterest in his freedom that cannot be curtailed without the procedural protections of \nnotice and hearing.”  Werner v. Wall, 836 F.3d 751, 760 (7th Cir. 2016) (citing Gagnon \nv. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 782 (1973); Morrissey, 408 U.S. at 482). \nThe question becomes, then, whether the language and structure of the super-\nvised release system in Illinois creates an expectancy of release, which would entitle \nreleasees to conditional liberty.  See Montgomery v. Anderson, 262 F.3d 641, 644 (7th \nCir. 2001); Taylor v. Edgar, 52 F. App’x 825, 826–27 (7th Cir. 2002).  Here, the answer \nis that it is common ground between the parties that the PRB in fact granted the \nplaintiffs their release.  (Dkt. 91 ¶¶ 2, 3–5, 42–43, 52, 63, 73.)  In so doing, the PRB \nessentially promised these individuals a form of statutory liberty that the IDOC could \nnot thereafter “revoke” without appropriate procedures.  See, e.g., Murdock v. Walker, \nNo. 08 C 1142, 2014 WL 916992, at *6 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 10, 2014); Heidelberg v. Illinois \nPrisoner Review Bd., 163 F.3d 1025, 1026 (7th Cir. 1998).  For this reason, the parole-\nrevocation analogy (e.g. Morrissey) is an apt one.  Cf. Domka v. Portage Cty., Wis., \n523 F.3d 776, 781 (7th Cir. 2008) (citing Paige v. Hudson, 341 F.3d 642, 643–44 (7th \nCir. 2003), and contemplating other losses of freedom). \nAccounting for Turner, the defendants neglected to identify conditions under \nwhich their interests outweigh a releasee’s conditional liberty.  True enough, the gov-\nernment’s need to protect the community does not necessarily diminish over time.  \nPage 48 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 49 of 61 PageID #:1554\nSee Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 690–91 (2001).  The problem, though, is that \nthe facts here come very close to sounding like preventive detention, which the Su-\npreme Court has sanctioned “only when limited to specially dangerous individuals \nand subject to strong procedural protections . . . In cases in which preventive deten-\ntion is of potentially indefinite duration, [the Supreme Court] [has] also demanded \nthat the dangerousness rationale be accompanied by some other special circum-\nstance, such as mental illness, that helps to create the danger.”  Id. at 691 (citations \nomitted).  The government cannot hold a citizen indefinitely because he or she at one \ntime committed a crime and therefore remains dangerous.  See Foucha v. Louisiana, \n504 U.S. 71, 85–86 (1992) (expanding that the reasoning weakens when the state \nargues as much for one class of offenders but not others). \nIt is not difficult to posit that the State’s need to pursue legitimate correctional \ngoals may more significantly limit the procedural protections the sooner after the \nPRB grants an indigent, homeless sex offender release rather than later.  Cf. Rasul \nv. Bush, 542 U.S. 466, 488 (2004) (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment) (com-\nmenting that the government may be able to indefinitely detain someone taken from \na hostile war zone for a matter of weeks, but as the period stretches from months to \nyears, the justification becomes weaker).  But here the defendants have detained at \nleast two plaintiffs since their release dates in 2011, or, for over eight years.   (Dkt. \n91 ¶¶ 61, 80.) \nIn other words, the IDOC may elect not to liberate a PRB-approved indigent, \nhomeless sex offender for some period, albeit not indefinitely.  See Zadvydas, 533 U.S. \nPage 49 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 50 of 61 PageID #:1555\nat 699 (avoiding a constitutional question by construing a statute to authorize deten-\ntion only for a reasonable time consistent with effectuating removal from custody); \nKansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346, 363–64 (1997) (approving of statutory schemes \nthat provide for indeterminate detention so long as they provide for periodic judicial \nreview and entitle the detainee to release as soon as the defect ceases to exist).  In \nthis case, one class member wondered during his testimony whether the only way he \nwould ever get out of prison is by dying.  (Dkt. 91 ¶ 102.)  At least two more stated \nthat they felt like they would be trapped in prison for the rest of their lives.  Id. \n¶¶ 108, 133. \nHaving determined that state law recognizes this liberty interest, the Court \nmust next address what procedural protections are necessary to ensure that IDOC’s \ndecision to not release an individual already granted release is neither arbitrary nor \nincorrect.  See Felce, 974 F.2d at 1496; Lane, 851 F.2d at 880 (citing Wolff v. McDon-\nnell, 418 U.S. 539, 556 (1974)).  This evaluation requires courts to weigh several fac-\ntors: \nFirst, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; sec-\nond, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the \nprocedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substi-\ntute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government’s interest, in-\ncluding the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens \nthat the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail. \n \nMathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 335 (1976).  The utilization of the foregoing ana-\nlytical model in this setting requires the Court to accommodate the plaintiffs’ liberty \ninterests in serving their mandatory supervised release terms in the community and \nPage 50 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 51 of 61 PageID #:1556\nthe defendants’ interests in facilitating the plaintiffs’ reintegration into society while \nensuring public safety. \n  Here, the problem is that there are a significant number of material facts that \nthe parties genuinely dispute.  The parties fundamentally disagree on whether there \nis a formal process in place for a person to contest the decision of a parole agent to \ndeny approval of a host site.  (Dkt. 91 ¶ 22; Dkt. 107 ¶ 29.)  The defendants submit \nthat an offender who wishes to contest the denial of a host site may file a grievance \nat his or her facility.  (Dkt. 91 ¶ 22.)  The plaintiffs call the defendants bluff on this \npoint, asserting that the IDOC does not treat denials of parole sites as grievable is-\nsues.  (Dkt. 107 ¶ 30.)  For what it is worth, the defendants’ witness testified that he \ndid not know whether the denial of a host site is a grievable issue.  (Dkt. 91 ¶ 22 \n(citing in part Pl. Ex. 14, Dep. of Dixon, at 114:20–115:3); Dkt. 107 ¶ 29; Dkt. 128 \n¶ 160.)  The record contains several illustrations of the IDOC refusing to review a \nhost-site denial; in fact, the defendants did not come up with one example of a host-\nsite denial being reviewed or overturned.  (Dkt. 91 ¶¶ 26, 71; Dkt. 107 ¶ 29.) \n  That is not all.  The parties also dispute whether the IDOC ever advises of-\nfenders of their right to contact the parole agent’s supervisor to request review of the \nagent’s decision, let alone gives them any information pertaining to how they can \nchallenge an unfavorable disposition.  (Dkt. 91 ¶ 23.)  Consequently, it is unclear \nwhether releasees are ever given this information.  As it stands now, all that appears \nto be agreed on is that a releasee “has no opportunity to contest the parole agent’s \nPage 51 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 52 of 61 PageID #:1557\ndecision(s) to reject proposed housing at a PRB hearing and the PRB does not review \nthe IDOC’s decision to reject proposed host sites.”  Id. ¶ 25. \n  Granted, the PRB does have a process in place to protect against a capricious \ntaking of liberty: it is called revocation.  See 730 ILCS 5/3-3-9(a)(3); see, e.g., Webb v. \nGodinez, No. 14 CV 10281, 2017 WL 2653142, at *5 (N.D. Ill. June 20, 2017).  In \nIllinois, the PRB—not the IDOC—has the power to revoke a releasee’s MSR term for \nfailure to comply with a condition, say, the host-site requirement.  Absent a court \norder or an express statutory authorization to extend the duration of imprisonment \nbeyond the original court-ordered term, then, the defendants are skating on thin ice.  \nSee McNeil v. Dir., Patuxent Inst., 407 U.S. 245, 254 n.3 (1972) (criticizing detention \nbeyond the expiration of a court-imposed sentence).5 \n  The coercive power of the state is awesome, but it is not absolute.  The defend-\nants cannot chalk everything up to discretion and call it a day.  Discretion without \nprocedure leads to arbitrary governance, and eventually, the loss of liberty.  That is \nwhat the Due Process Clause guards against.  That is also what the separation of \npowers guards against.  The Supreme Court has warned that “the Constitution may \nwell preclude granting “‘an administrative body the unreviewable authority to make \ndeterminations implicating fundamental rights.’”  Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 692 (quoting \nSuperintendent, Mass. Correctional Institution at Walpole v. Hill, 472 U.S. 445, 450 \n(1985)). \n                                                 \n5 A court sentenced the first named plaintiff, Paul Murphy, to 36 months’ probation.  (Dkt. \n91 ¶ 39.)  Although imprisonment was not originally imposed on Murphy, he has been incar-\ncerated—not to mention approved for release—for over eight years.  Id. ¶ 42. \nPage 52 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 53 of 61 PageID #:1558\n  Notwithstanding the foregoing discussion, the record still remains riddled with \ndisputed facts, so a trial will be necessary to determine whether the defendants offer \nthe plaintiffs any procedure to determine whether a parole agent’s rejection of a pro-\nposed host site was proper or not.  Only then will the Court be able to decide whether \nthat process is constitutionally sound.  Accordingly, the Court denies both parties’ \ncross-motions for summary judgment (Dkts. 75, 88) as to the procedural due process \nclaim (Count III). \nIV.  Eighth Amendment (Count IV) \n  Changing direction, the plaintiffs’ last claim is that the defendants’ application \nof the statutory scheme to them contravenes the Eighth Amendment to the Constitu-\ntion.  This analysis is separate and independent from the previous equal protection \ndiscussion.  See Harrington v. Scribner, 785 F.3d 1299, 1307 (9th Cir. 2015) (“A pris-\noner’s success on an equal protection claim is not dependent on whether the govern-\nment met its obligations under the Eighth Amendment.”).  The claims do not compete, \nand the deference accorded to prison officials may very well differ under each provi-\nsion.  See id. \n  The Eighth Amendment generally limits the government’s power to punish \ncriminal offenders.  The Supreme Court has explained that: \nThe Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause [of the Eighth Amend-\nment] circumscribes the criminal process in three ways: First, it limits \nthe kinds of punishment that can be imposed on those convicted of \ncrimes, e.g., Estelle v. Gamble, [429 U.S. 97 (1976)]; Trop v. Dulles, [356 \nU.S. 86 (1958)]; second, it proscribes punishment grossly disproportion-\nate to the severity of the crime, e.g., Weems v. United States, [217 U.S. \n349 (1910)]; and third, it imposes substantive limits on what can be \nPage 53 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 54 of 61 PageID #:1559\nmade criminal and punished as such, e.g., Robinson v. California, [370 \nU.S. 660 (1962)]. \n \nIngraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 667 (1977).  This case implicates the third iteration \nelucidated above—the substantive limitations on what the government may crimi-\nnalize and therefore punish.  The relevant distinction lies in applying criminal laws \nto punish conduct, which is constitutionally proper, and applying criminal laws to \npunish status, which is constitutionally improper.  See generally Powell v. State of \nTex., 392 U.S. 514 (1968); Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660 (1962). \n  The plaintiffs argue that the defendants are punishing them because of their \nhomeless status.  The Eighth Amendment guides them, proscribing not just the crim-\ninal punishment of an individual’s status, but also an individual’s involuntary con-\nduct otherwise inseparable from his or her status.  See Martin v. City of Boise, 902 \nF.3d 1031, 1047–48 (9th Cir. 2018) (quoting and pulling from Jones v. City of Los \nAngeles, 444 F.3d 1118, 1137 (9th Cir. 2006), vacated as moot following settlement, \n505 F.3d 1006 (9th Cir. 2007)); State v. Adams, 91 So. 3d 724, 753–54 (Ala. Crim. \nApp. 2010); Powell, 392 U.S. at 567 (Fortas, J., dissenting) (declaring that “criminal \npenalties may not be inflicted upon a person for being in a condition he is powerless \nto change . . .”). \n  It is not possible for homeless people to avoid sitting, lying, or sleeping in public \nbecause of their homeless status, at least where the evidence establishes that there \nis an absolute lack of available shelter space.  See Martin, 902 F.3d at 1047–48; Ad-\nams, 91 So. 3d at 753–54 (discussing and borrowing liberally from Jones, 444 F.3d at \n1131–38).    That  lack  of  housing  is  what  drives  the  conduct  from  voluntary  to \nPage 54 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 55 of 61 PageID #:1560\ninvoluntary.  See Martin, 902 F.3d at 1047–48; Adams, 91 So. 3d at 753–54; see also \nJoel v. City of Orlando, 232 F.3d 1353, 1361–62 (11th Cir. 2000) (reasoning that there \nwas unrefuted evidence of the availability of shelter space, meaning that the home-\nless person had an opportunity to comply with the ordinance, making his conduct \nvoluntary). \n  In this case, the IDOC requires releasees to secure a qualifying host site to \nreside at while on MSR.  (Dkt. 91 ¶ 2.)  The IDOC exercises the sole discretion to \napprove or deny an inmate’s proposed host site based on a variety of statutes and \nregulations that restrict where sex offenders may live while on MSR.  Id. ¶¶ 3–5.  \nUltimately, a parole agent must authorize the placement.  Id. ¶ 4.  The only time a \nperson can apply for the termination of his or her indeterminate MSR term is after \nsuccessfully serving three years of that term outside of prison.  Id.  ¶ 5. \n  So, for someone who is homeless, it is virtually impossible to comply with the \nIDOC’s application of the host site requirement.  (Dkt. 91 ¶ 38 (“‘Q: Is it possible for \na sex offender with an indeterminate MSR term who, A, does not have money to pay \nfor his own housing, and, B, does not have family or friends on the outside who can \npay for his housing [whether by living with them or paying for separate accommoda-\ntions] to ever get out of the Illinois Department of Corrections? A: Never say never, \nbut, . . . using those criteria, no.’”).) \n  The undisputed evidence here establishes that the plaintiffs are indigent, that \nthey have no family or friends with whom they can live, and despite their efforts, \nhomeless shelters, halfway houses, and work-release programs are not permitted to \nPage 55 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 56 of 61 PageID #:1561\naccept them as residents.  Id. ¶¶ 45–49, 64–65, 67–70, 74–77, 87–89, 92–95, 98–101, \n104–07, 110–13, 116–19, 121–24, 126–28, 130, 132–33.  Furthermore, there are no \nhalfway houses or transitional housing facilities in Illinois that will accept a convicted \nsex offender as a resident.  Id. ¶ 28; Dkt. 107 ¶ 25. \n  On top of that, the IDOC does not permit any sex offender to reside at a home-\nless shelter while on mandatory supervised release, nor does it allow them to partic-\nipate in work release programs that it provides to other offenders.  (Dkt. 91 ¶¶ 29–\n30.)  For the plaintiffs, then, the failure to procure a host site is “not voluntary conduct \nmerely related to, or derivative of, the status of homelessness, but [is] entirely invol-\nuntary conduct that [is] inseparable from [their] status of homelessness.”  Adams, 91 \nSo. 3d at 754.  Thus, the defendants’ application of the host site requirement consti-\ntutes cruel and unusual punishment. \n   The defendants respond in the main that the State of Illinois is not charging \nthe plaintiffs with a crime of being homeless, as other jurisdictions did in the cited \nprecedent, prompting courts to strike down the operative statutes.  True, but this is \na distinction without a difference.  All the Eighth Amendment calls for is punishment: \na new indictment is of course sufficient; however, it is not necessary.  Cf. Martin, 902 \nF.3d at 1048 (referring to “criminal penalties”); Diaz v. Lampela, 601 F. App’x 670, \n675–76 (10th Cir. 2015) (in relying on this case the defendants miss the mark because \nthe court there appreciates that “punitive incarceration solely on the basis of a per-\nson’s status or propensities violates the Eighth Amendment.” (emphasis added)). \nPage 56 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 57 of 61 PageID #:1562\n  Prolonged  incarceration  is  indeed  punishment  within  the  meaning  of  the \nEighth Amendment.  See, e.g., Courtney v. Butler, No. 17-3310, 2019 WL 718888, at \n*1 (7th Cir. Feb. 13, 2019); Aguilar v. Gaston-Camara, 861 F.3d 626, 631 (7th Cir. \n2017); Turner v. Godinez, 693 F. App’x 449, 454 (7th Cir. 2017); Werner v. Wall, 836 \nF.3d 751, 760–61 (7th Cir. 2016); Childress v. Walker, 787 F.3d 433, 438–39 (7th Cir. \n2015); Burke v. Johnston, 452 F.3d 665, 667 (7th Cir. 2006); Campbell v. Peters, 256 \nF.3d 695, 700 (7th Cir. 2001).  Here, some plaintiffs have been kept in prison eight \nyears past their release date.  (Dkt. 91 ¶¶ 61, 80.) \n  The Seventh Circuit has, in fact, applied the status doctrine outside the normal \ncontext of criminal prosecution: in that case, probation.  See Sweeney v. United States, \n353 F.2d 10, 11 (7th Cir. 1965) (ruling that a probation condition is unreasonable if it \nis impossible to obey because the probationer has no power of volition and hence can-\nnot abide by the condition).  A revocation of supervised release (or here, a decision \nnot to release) for the failure to comply with a condition of release is analogous to a \ncriminal prosecution of a status offense.  Cf. United States v. Pinjuv, 218 F.3d 1125, \n1130–32 (9th Cir. 2000) (differing from this Court’s view but granting that those con-\nditions that do not contribute significantly to the remedial goals of supervised release \nwill be invalid and unenforceable).  The defendants’ application of the host site re-\nquirement, while perhaps contributing to public safety, frustrates the rehabilitation \nprocess and is constitutionally void. \n  Because the substantive-limits claim carries the day, the Court need not reach \nthe  plaintiffs’  additional  and  alternative  argument  that  the  challenged  scheme \nPage 57 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 58 of 61 PageID #:1563\nviolates the Eighth Amendment by imposing a disproportionate sentence.  The par-\nties also briefed the issue of deliberate indifference earlier on in this litigation but \nhave since seemed to abandon it in their reply briefs.  The question of whether state \nof mind is a necessary element of a substantive-limits Eighth Amendment claim, as \nopposed to, for instance, a kinds-of-punishment claim (e.g. Estelle), is one not defini-\ntively answered by the case law.  That might not come as a surprise because the \nSupreme Court applies the substantive limitation (proscribing punishment of a sta-\ntus) “sparingly.”  Ingraham, 430 U.S. at 667. \n  For what it is worth, none of the cases on this Eighth Amendment branch dis-\ncuss deliberate indifference.  In its standing analysis in Jones, the Ninth Circuit rec-\nognized as a general matter that when “the state transgresses this limit, a person \nsuffers constitutionally cognizable harm as soon as he is subjected to the criminal \nprocess.”  444 F.3d at 1129 (vacated as moot following settlement).  A plaintiff with \nthis species of claim, then, need only show that objective deprivation of liberty or \nproperty after the state overstepped the bound on its ability to criminalize.  The Court \nappreciates, though, that this as-applied challenge is unique in the sense that the \npunishment is a post-conviction harm (extension of incarceration) and not a pre-con-\nviction one.  So, it is the jailers—not the arresters—that matter in this case, and \nsubjective intent is generally a prerequisite in lawsuits against correctional staff (but \nnot the police). \n  Assuming for the sake of argument that the plaintiffs must plead and prove \ndeliberate indifference, the Court concludes that they have.  See Childress, 787 F.3d \nPage 58 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 59 of 61 PageID #:1564\nat 439–40.  The defendants knew of this problem and the risk that they were inflicting \nunwarranted punishment (e.g. numerous lawsuits, admissions in this case, news me-\ndia and other public records); they failed to act or took ineffectual action (indeed, their \ncontinued enforcement exacerbated it); and their response caused the unjustified de-\ntention (they chose to confine these individuals past their release date).  Cf. Burke, \n452 F.3d at 669.  This awareness amounts to a reckless disregard of constitutional \nrights. \n  Once again, the Court notes that its decision relates to an as-applied challenge \nand it in no way purports to tell the defendants how to best administer mandatory \nsupervised release for sex offenders.  The Court does not order the immediate release \nof the plaintiffs, nor does it hold that the framework always operates unconstitution-\nally or that there are no set of circumstances under which it would be valid.  The \nCourt only holds that the host site requirement is unconstitutional under the specific \nfacts in this case and as applied to the defendants.  It remains the IDOC’s job to \nappropriately exercise its discretion to achieve the goals of the state legislature in \nimplementing mandatory supervised release for sex offenders.  Accordingly, the \nCourt grants the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment (Dkt. 75) on the Eighth \nAmendment claim (Count IV) and denies the defendants’ cross-motion (Dkt. 88). \n   \nPage 59 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 60 of 61 PageID #:1565\nCONCLUSION \n  Sex offenders are criminals, plain and simple.  Yet the “one enduring lesson in \nthe long struggle to balance individual rights against society’s need to defend itself \nagainst lawlessness,” is that it “‘is easy to make light of insistence on scrupulous re-\ngard for the safeguards of civil liberties when invoked on behalf of the unworthy.  It \nis too easy.  History bears testimony that by such disregard are the rights of liberty \nextinguished, heedlessly at first, then stealthily, and brazenly in the end.’”  United \nStates v. Montoya de Hernandez, 473 U.S. 531, 567 (1985) (quoting Davis v. United \nStates, 328 U.S. 582, 597 (1946) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting)). \n  The Illinois Legislature thought it best to rehabilitate sex offenders by reinte-\ngrating them, like all other convicted felons, into the community after prison.  The \nConstitution thus entitles them to the same conditional liberty that all other re-\nleasees receive.  Because the defendants’ current application of the host-site require-\nment permits the indefinite detention of the plaintiffs, it breaches the promises en-\nshrined in the Bill of Rights.  The Court accordingly grants the plaintiffs’ motion for \nsummary judgment (Dkt. 75) as to their equal protection (Count II) and Eighth \nAmendment claims (Count IV), denies it as to their substantive (Count I) and proce-\ndural (Count III) due process claims, and denies the defendants’ cross-motion in full \n(Dkt. 88). \n  Although the Court today decides liability, it reserves ruling on the proper \nremedy to afford the plaintiffs.  The Court sets a status hearing for 4/22/2019 at 9:00 \nPage 60 of 61 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 61 of 61 PageID #:1566\na.m. to discuss a trial date for the procedural due process claim and the need for a \nremedial hearing to determine the scope of equitable relief. \n \n \n             \n \n         \n            ____________________________________ \n            Virginia M.

In particular, \nindividuals convicted of sex-related crimes who are sentenced to three years to life \nof mandatory supervised release (“MSR”) find themselves stuck in prison for life as \na result of the imposition of unmeetable restrictions on where they can live that \nmust be satisfied in order for such individuals to be released on MSR. The \nchallenged scheme results in what amounts to a Kafkaesque nightmare whereby \nthese individuals are denied any semblance of proportionality in their prison \nsentences and due process of law. \n2.  This is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief. Plaintiffs, \nindividually and on behalf of the classes they seek to represent, allege violations of \ntheir rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment of the United States \nConstitution. \n3.  As of the filing of this complaint, there are approximately 4,000 people \nimprisoned in the Illinois Department of Corrections who have been convicted of \nsex-related offenses for which state law imposes an indeterminate term of “three \nyears to life” of Mandatory Supervised Release (“MSR”) (formerly known as parole). \n4.  As set forth below, Illinois laws severely restrict where individuals \ndeemed sex offenders may live while on MSR. As a result, the vast majority of such \nprisoners are unable to find approved “host sites” at which to serve their MSR \nterms. Because of the unavailability of compliant housing, such prisoners are \ndetained in the Illinois Department of Corrections long after they have served the \n\t 2\t\n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/19/16 Page 3 of 34 PageID #:3\nterm of imprisonment to which they have been sentenced. For individuals with \nindeterminate MSR sentences, their prison terms are in effect converted to \nsentences of lifetime imprisonment without any possibility of release.    \n5.  The named Plaintiffs are individuals currently being held in the \ncustody of the Illinois Department of Corrections who have been sentenced to serve \n“three years to life” MSR terms and are unable to find “host sites.” Plaintiffs, \nindividually and on behalf of two classes of similarly situated individuals (identified \nbelow), challenge the constitutionality of the statutory schemes that cause this \nsevere deprivation of their constitutional right to liberty.  \nJurisdiction and Venue \n6.  Jurisdiction for Plaintiffs’ federal claims is based on 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 \nand 1343(a).  \n7.  Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b), in that \nthe claims arose in this district as alleged below. \nThe Parties \n8.  Defendant Attorney General Lisa Madigan is sued in her official \ncapacity as the Attorney General of the State of Illinois. The Attorney General of \nthe State of Illinois is responsible for executing and administering the laws of the \nState of Illinois and is charged with advising state’s attorneys throughout the state. \n9.  Under Illinois law, Defendant Madigan has the authority to participate \nin and assist with criminal prosecutions, including charges under the statutes \nchallenged herein. Defendant Madigan also has the authority to consult with and \n\t 3\t\n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/19/16 Page 4 of 34 PageID #:4\nadvise Illinois State’s Attorneys concerning criminal prosecutions. (See 15 ILCS \n205/4). \n10.  Defendant Madigan has been and continues to be directly involved in \nthe enforcement of the statutory schemes at issue in this case by defending the \nstatutes in state court criminal appeals. \n11.  Defendant John Baldwin is sued in his official capacity as director of \nthe Illinois Department of Corrections. In his capacity as the director of IDOC, he \nhas final authority to set the Department of Corrections’ policies and practices with \nregard to approval of prisoners’ “host sites” for MSR.  \n12.  Plaintiff Paul F. Murphy is a prisoner at Taylorville Correctional \nCenter in Taylorville, Illinois, and a registered sex offender. He has completed his \nthree-year prison term. The PRB approved Murphy for release on MSR on March 3, \n2014. To date, the IDOC has not released Murphy from prison because he cannot \nfind an approved “host site” at which to serve his MSR. Murphy has no money to \npay for housing and no family members outside of prison who could help him pay for \nhousing. The state of Illinois provides no transitional housing for sex offenders who \ncannot afford their own housing while on MSR. IDOC will not release a homeless \nindividual on MSR. Because his MSR term is indefinite, Murphy remains in \nTaylorville Correctional Center with no foreseeable possibility of release.  \n13.  Plaintiff Stanley Meyer is a prisoner at Taylorville Correctional Center \nin Taylorville, Illinois, and a registered sex offender. He has completed his four-year \nprison term. The PRB approved Meyer for release on MSR on May 12, 2011. To \n\t 4\t\n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/19/16 Page 5 of 34 PageID #:5\ndate, the IDOC has not released Meyer from prison because he cannot find an \napproved “host site” at which to serve his MSR. Meyer has no money to pay for \nhousing and no family members outside of prison who could help him pay for \nhousing. Because his MSR term is indefinite, Meyer remains in Taylorville \nCorrectional Center with no foreseeable possibility of release.  \n14.  Plaintiff J.D. Lindenmeier is a prisoner at Taylorville Correctional \nCenter in Taylorville, Illinois, and a registered sex offender. He has completed his \nsix-year prison term. The PRB approved Lindenmeier for release on MSR on July \n18, 2011. To date, the IDOC has not released Lindenmeier from prison because he \ncannot find an approved “host site” at which to serve his MSR. As set forth below, \nLindenmeier’s family members have made substantial efforts to find a “host site” \nthat will meet IDOC’s approval. Lindenmeier has proposed six different host sites \nwith various family members who are willing to take him in and assist in his \nsuccessful compliance with MSR terms and reintegration into society. IDOC has \nrejected all of these proposed sites. Lindenmeier has no other options. Because his \nMSR term is indefinite, Lindenmeier remains in Taylorville Correctional Center \nwith no foreseeable possibility of release.  \n15.  Plaintiff Keenon Smith is a prisoner at Pickneyville Correctional \nCenter in Pickneyville, Illinois, and a registered sex offender. He has completed his \nfive-year prison term. The PRB approved Smith for release on MSR on November 4, \n2016. To date, the IDOC has not released Smith from prison because he cannot find \nan approved “host site” at which to serve his MSR. As set forth below, Smith’s \n\t 5\t\n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/19/16 Page 6 of 34 PageID #:6\nmother has made substantial efforts to find a “host site” that will meet IDOC’s \napproval, but to no avail. Smith’s mother is an elementary school teacher. She is \nwilling to take Smith into her home or pay for his housing elsewhere. Smith’s \nmother has proposed at least 12 different host sites in Chicago and the suburbs. \nIDOC has rejected all of these proposed sites. Because his MSR term is indefinite, \nSmith remains in Pickneyville Correctional Center with no foreseeable possibility of \nrelease. \n16.  Plaintiff Jasen Gustafsen is a prisoner at Lincoln Correctional Center \nin Lincoln, Illinois, and a registered sex offender. He is has completed his four-year \nprison term. The PRB approved Gustafsen for release on MSR on October 19, 2014. \nTo date, the IDOC has not released Gustafsen from prison because he cannot find \nan approved “host site” at which to serve his MSR. As set forth below, Gustafsen \nhas no financial resources of his own and no family members who are able to pay for \nhis housing outside of prison. His only options for housing outside of prison are \nstaying with his mother or his aunt. Gustafson has proposed his mother’s and \naunt’s residences as “host sites.” IDOC has rejected both of these proposed sites. \nBecause his MSR term is indefinite, Gustafson remains in Lincoln Correctional \nCenter with no foreseeable possibility of release. \n17.  Plaintiff Alfred Aukema is a prisoner at Taylorville Correctional \nCenter in Taylorville, Illinois, and a registered sex offender. He is scheduled to \ncomplete his five-year prison sentence on September 7, 2017. Plaintiff Aukema has \nno financial resources to afford to pay for a “host site” and no friends or family \n\t 6\t\n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/19/16 Page 7 of 34 PageID #:7\noutside of prison who can take him in or pay for his housing. Because his MSR term \nis indefinite, Aukema faces a likelihood of lifetime imprisonment due to the lack of \navailable compliant housing and his inability to afford housing, if it were available, \noutside of prison.  \n18.  Plaintiff Kevin Tucek is a prisoner at Taylorville Correctional Center \nin Taylorville, Illinois, and a registered sex offender. He is scheduled to complete his \neight-year prison sentence on July 20, 2020. Plaintiff Tucek has no financial \nresources to afford to pay for a host site and no friends or family outside of prison \nwho can take him in or pay for his housing. Because his MSR term is indefinite, \nTucke faces a likelihood of lifetime imprisonment due to the unavailability of \ncompliant housing and his inability to afford housing, if it were available, outside of \nprison.  \nThe Statutory Schemes At Issue \n19.  As described in the paragraphs below, individuals convicted of certain \nsex-related offenses are subject to numerous overlapping statutory and regulatory \nschemes that severely restrict where they can live and make it nearly impossible for \nthem to satisfy the conditions required for release from prison on MSR.  \nStatutes Requiring the Imposition of an Indefinite MSR Term  \n20.  Illinois’ Unified Code of Corrections provides that for all felony \nconvictions, the sentencing court must impose a term of “parole or mandatory \nsupervised release ... as part of the sentencing order.” 730 ILCS 5/5-8-1(d). \n\t 7\t\n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/19/16 Page 8 of 34 PageID #:8\n21.  Individuals convicted of “predatory criminal sexual assault of a child, \naggravated criminal sexual assault, or criminal sexual assault” after July 1, 2005, \nor of “aggravated child pornography ... manufacture of child pornography, or \ndissemination of child pornography” after January 1, 2009, are subject to the \nmandatory imposition of an indeterminate term of MSR “rang[ing] from a minimum \nof three years to a maximum of the natural life.” 730 ILCS 5/5-8-1(d)(4). \n22.  The Illinois Supreme Court has interpreted 730 ILCS 5/5-8-1(d)(4) to \nrequire sentencing courts to impose an indeterminate MSR period of “three years to \nlife” rather than a determinate period within the range of three years to natural \nlife. People v. Reinhart, 2012 IL 111719 (2012).  \n23.  Under 730 ILCS 5/3-14-2.5(d), a person with an indeterminate MSR \nsentence of “three years to life” can only apply for termination of his MSR after \nsuccessfully completing three years of MSR outside of prison. This is so because an \napplication for release from indeterminate MSR must be “supported by a \nrecommendation by the releasee’s supervising agent,” and a “supervising agent” is \nnot appointed until the individual is actually released from prison. As a result, \nprisoners receive no credit for MSR time they serve while incarcerated and thus can \nnever max out their MSR sentence—a condition widely known as “dead time.” \nConditions for Release from IDOC Custody on MSR \n24.  The Prison Review Board (“PRB”) is responsible for establishing \nrelease dates from prison for individuals deemed eligible for MSR and setting the \nconditions for release on MSR. 730 ILCS 5/3-3-1.  \n\t 8\t\n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/19/16 Page 9 of 34 PageID #:9\n25.  The Illinois Department of Corrections (“IDOC”) retains custody of all \nprisoners approved for release on MSR by the PRB and is charged with assuring \nthat prisoners are in compliance with the conditions set by the PRB before they are \nreleased from an IDOC facility on MSR. 730 ILCS 5/3-14-2.  \n26.  Under Illinois law, once the PRB approves a prisoner for release on \nMSR, such individuals have a due process interest in being released from \nimprisonment in an IDOC facility. Murdock v. Walker, No. 08 C 1142, 2014 WL \n916992, at *6 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 10, 2014) (Durkin, J.). \n27.  The fact that a prisoner is eligible for release on MSR because he has \nserved his prison sentence and has been approved for release by the PRB does not \nnecessarily mean the individual will be released from prison.   \n28.  Rather, any prisoner granted release on MSR must meet conditions \nimposed by Illinois statutes and by the PRB before being released from prison. If \nsuch conditions are not met, the parolee will be detained in prison.   \n29.  One condition of release from prison on MSR is having an approved \n“host site” at which to reside while serving the MSR term. \n30.  IDOC has the sole authority to approve or deny a prisoners’ proposed \n“host site” based on its assessment of whether it meets the conditions imposed by \nIllinois statutes and by the PRB. \n31.  If a prisoner lacks an approved host site, he will not be released from \nprison even if the PRB has found him eligible for release on MSR. \n\t 9\t\n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/19/16 Page 10 of 34 PageID #:10\n32.  As shown below, the overlapping layers of restrictions imposed by \nstatute and IDOC policy on where individuals deemed sex offenders can live, along \nwith the lack of housing assistance for indigent prisoners, result in the vast \nmajority of prisoners with a three-to-life MSR sentence being unable to find \ncompliant housing and serving what amounts to life sentences in prison.  \nResidency Restrictions that Apply to All Individuals Classified as Child \nSex Offenders \n \n33.  First, for IDOC to approve a host site for an individual sentenced to \n“three-to-life” MSR, the host site must comply with all of the restrictions imposed \nunder Illinois law on where individuals deemed “child sex offenders” may reside.  \n34.  720 ILCS 5/11-9.3 (b-5) makes it unlawful “to knowingly reside within \n500 feet of a school building or the real property comprising any school that persons \nunder the age of 18 attend ... [unless] the property is owned by the offender and was \npurchased before July 7, 2000.”  \n35.  There are 4,979 primary and high schools in Illinois. See, Illinois State \nBoard of Education 2015-16 Enrollment Data: \nhttp://www.isbe.state.il.us/research/htmls/fall_housing.htm (last visited December \n14, 2016). \n36.  720 ILCS 5/11-9.3 (b-10) makes it unlawful “to knowingly reside within \n500 feet of a playground, child care institution, day care center, part day child care \nfacility, day care home, group day care home, or a facility providing programs or \nservices exclusively directed toward persons under 18 years of age” unless the \n\t 10\t\n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/19/16 Page 11 of 34 PageID #:11\nproperty is owned by the offender and was purchased before the effective date of the \nprohibition.  \n37.  There are 9,929 licensed daycare providers in Illinois. See, Illinois \nDepartment of Children and Family Services Provider Index, available at: \nhttps://sunshine.dcfs.illinois.gov/Content/Licensing/Daycare/Search.aspx (last \nvisited December 14, 2016). \n38.  In the City of Chicago alone, there are 332 Chicago Park District \nowned playgrounds. See, https://data.cityofchicago.org/Parks-Recreation/Parks-\nContaining-Playgrounds/n8h8-zjr3 (last visited December 14, 2016). \n39.  Pursuant to 720 ILCS 5/11-9.3(e), the 500-foot distance is measured \nfrom the outer property line of the prohibited location to the outer property line of \nthe potential residence. \nStatutory Restrictions on Where Sex Offenders Can Reside While on MSR \n \n40.  In addition to complying with the housing restrictions imposed by \nstatute on all individuals classified as child sex offenders, prisoners who seek \nrelease from the IDOC on MSR must also comply with additional restrictions \nimposed under Illinois law on where individuals on MSR may reside.  \n41.  One of the restrictions is 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6), which makes it \nunlawful for any individual convicted of a sex offense to reside while on MSR “at the \nsame address or in the same condominium unit or apartment unit or in the same \ncondominium complex or apartment complex with another person he or she knows \nor reasonably should know is a convicted sex offender or has been placed on \n\t 11\t\n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/19/16 Page 12 of 34 PageID #:12\nsupervision for a sex offense,” unless such housing is an IDOC approved half-way \nhouse or medical facility. \n42.  This statute is routinely applied to prohibit individuals seeking release \non MSR from residing in the same trailer park or multi-building apartment complex \nas another individual with a past conviction for a sex-related offense.   \n43.  There are no halfway houses in the State of Illinois that accept \nparolees classified as sex offenders. \n44.  Another statutory restriction is 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(b-1)(12), which \nprohibits anyone deemed a sex offender from “resid[ing] near ... parks, schools, day \ncare centers, swimming pools, beaches, theaters, or any other places where minor \nchildren congregate” without prior approval of the Illinois Department of \nCorrections while on MSR.  \n45.  In the City of Chicago alone, there are 581 parks. See, \nhttps://data.cityofchicago.org/Parks-Recreation/Parks-Locations/wwy2-k7b3 (last \nvisited December 14, 2016). \n46.  The statute does not define what is meant by “near.” \n47.  The statute does not define what is meant by “any other places where \nminor children congregate.”1 \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1   The Fourth Circuit recently found unconstitutional a North Carolina statute \ncontaining a very similar restriction in Does v. Cooper, 16-6026 (4th Cir., Nov. 30, 2016).  \nThe statute at issue there prohibited people classified as sex offenders from “knowingly \nbeing ... at any place where minors gather for regularly scheduled educational, recreational, \nor social programs.” Id. at 5, citing N.C. Gen. Stat. Art. 7, §14-208.18(a)(3). The Court found \nthe statute unconstitutionally vague because “neither an ordinary citizen nor a law \nenforcement officer could reasonably determine what activity was criminalized.” Id. at 21–\n22.  \n\t 12\t\n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/19/16 Page 13 of 34 PageID #:13\n48.  The determination of whether a proposed “host site” complies with \nthese prohibitions is completely within the IDOC’s discretion.  \n49.  Illinois Department of Corrections officials routinely cite the \nprohibition on living “near” the locations enumerated in 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(b-1)(12) to \ndeny proposed housing locations.  \n50.  Illinois law also gives the Illinois Department of Corrections discretion   \nto impose “any other appropriate restrictions concerning the offender’s use of or \naccess to a computer or any other device with Internet capability imposed by the \nBoard, the Department or the offender’s supervising agent.” 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7 \n(a)(7.11)(iv). \n51.  Pursuant to this authority, the IDOC routinely prohibits individuals \ndeemed sex offenders from serving their MSR at any “host site” where any resident \nhas a computer or smart phone with Internet capability. \n52.  Illinois law also gives the Illinois Department of Corrections broad \ndiscretion to approve or deny housing for individuals seeking release on MSR for \nany reason they see fit. See, 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7 (b-1)(1) (setting forth that anyone \ndeemed a sex offender who seeks release on MSR may “reside only at a Department \napproved location.”) \n53.  This discretion is routinely exercised to deny approval for sex \noffenders’ proposed “host sites,” even when those sites comply with all written \nrestrictions (such as restrictions on living near parks, schools, day cares, etc.) \nenumerated under Illinois law.  \n\t 13\t\n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/19/16 Page 14 of 34 PageID #:14\nThe Unavailability of Host Sites for Indigent Prisoners \n54.  The State of Illinois provides no housing resources for sex offenders \nwho are approved for release from IDOC on MSR. \n55.  There is no transitional housing (or “halfway houses”) in Illinois that \naccept individuals with sex-related convictions.  \n56.  There are no homeless shelters in Illinois that accept sex offenders. \n57.  Unless a parolee has money to pay for his own housing or people \noutside of prison who are willing to pay for his housing or take him in, he cannot be \nreleased from an IDOC facility to a “host site” on MSR. \n58.  The IDOC will not approve a homeless individual’s release on MSR due \nto the lack of an approved “host site.”  \nThe Consequences of the Unavailability of Housing for Sex Offenders who \nare Sentenced to Indeterminate MSR Terms of “Three Years to Life” \n \n59.  The severe restrictions on where people classified as sex offenders can \nlive while on MSR under Illinois law, in combination with the lack of halfway \nhouses that accept people classified as sex offenders, make it impossible for the vast \nmajority of individuals convicted of sex-related offenses find an approved “host site.” \nAccordingly, they must serve their MSR time in prison. \n60.  A prisoner sentenced to a fixed MSR period (for example, an MSR term \nof three years), who cannot find an approved host site and is imprisoned after being \napproved for MSR will receive credit towards having served his MSR period while in \nprison. Eventually, such an individual will “max out” his MSR time—i.e., serve the \n\t 14\t\n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/19/16 Page 15 of 34 PageID #:15\nfull length of his MSR in an IDOC facility—and then be released from IDOC \ncustody with no supervision. \n61.  The consequences, however, are entirely different for prisoners with \nindeterminate MSR sentences of “three years to life.” Prisoners with indeterminate \nMSR sentences who cannot find approved host sites can never max out their MSR \ntime because, as set forth in ¶23 above, they cannot meet the statutory conditions \nfor seeking termination of their MSR while imprisoned in an IDOC facility. \n62.  Accordingly, the sentences of these prisoners are effectively converted \nto life imprisonment, even though such a sentence was never imposed, nor \ncontemplated, the sentencing court.  \nFacts Pertinent to the Named Plaintiffs \nPaul F. Murphy \n63.  Plaintiff Paul F. Murphy, 61, is a prisoner at Taylorville Correctional \nCenter in Taylorville, Illinois, and a registered sex offender. He was convicted in \n2011 of aggravated child pornography, for which he was sentenced to 36 months \nprobation.  \n64.  In August 2013, Murphy’s probation was revoked because, while \nhomeless and reporting his addresses on a weekly basis pursuant to state statute, \nhe was arrested for sleeping in the doorway of a church.  \n65.  Murphy was sentenced to three years in prison at 50 percent, plus two \nyears of MSR. In February 2014, his MSR sentence was amended to three years to \nlife.  \n\t 15\t\n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/19/16 Page 16 of 34 PageID #:16\n66.  The PRB approved Murphy for release on MSR on March 3, 2014.  \n67.  To date, the IDOC has not released Murphy from prison because he \ncannot find an approved “host site” at which to serve his MSR.  \n68.  Murphy has no money to pay for housing and cannot earn any money \nbecause he is in prison. \n69.  Murphy has no living family members or friends outside of prison who \ncould help him pay for housing.  \n70.  Murphy’s only true option for housing outside of IDOC is a halfway \nhouse or homeless shelter. \n71.  Murphy applied for housing at a halfway house in East St. Louis, \nIllinois. At the time he applied, it was the only halfway house in the state that \naccepted sex offenders. When he applied, he was told that there was a five-year \nwaiting list for a room at this halfway house.  \n72.  The halfway house in East St. Louis subsequently closed. \n73.  Now, there are no halfway houses or homeless shelters in Illinois that \nwill accept sex offenders.  \n74.  The state of Illinois provides no financial resources for sex offenders \nwho cannot afford their own housing while on MSR.  \n75.  IDOC will not release a homeless individual on MSR.  \n76.  Because his MSR term is indefinite, Murphy faces imprisonment in the \nIllinois Department of Corrections for the rest of his life. Murphy will never be able \nto meet the statutory requirements discussed above for an approved “host site,” \n\t 16\t\n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/19/16 Page 17 of 34 PageID #:17\nwhich is required for release on MSR. Moreover, he can never apply for termination \nof his MSR period while in prison pursuant to the terms of 730 ILCS 5/3-14-2.5(d), \ndiscussed in ¶23 above. \nStanley Meyer  \n77.  Plaintiff Stanley Meyer, 41, is an inmate at Taylorville Correctional \nCenter in Taylorville, Illinois, and a registered sex offender. He was convicted in \n2008 of criminal sex assault and sentenced to 48 months in jail at 85 percent and an \nMSR sentence of three years to life.  \n78.  Plaintiff Meyer has completed his prison sentence. The PRB approved \nMeyer for release on MSR on May 12, 2011.  \n79.  To date, the IDOC has not released Meyer from prison because he \ncannot find an approved “host site” at which to serve his MSR.  \n80.  Meyer has no money to pay for housing and cannot earn money to pay \nfor housing because he is in prison.  \n81.  Meyer has no family members or friends outside of prison who can help \nhim pay for housing.  \n82.  Because his MSR term is indefinite, Meyer faces imprisonment in the \nIllinois Department of Corrections for the rest of his life. Meyer will never be able to \nmeet the statutory requirements discussed above for an approved “host site,” which \nis required for release on MSR. Moreover, he can never apply for termination of his \nMSR period while in prison pursuant to the terms of 730 ILCS 5/3-14-2.5(d), \ndiscussed in ¶23 above. \n\t 17\t\n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/19/16 Page 18 of 34 PageID #:18\nJ.D. Lindenmeier \n83.  Plaintiff J.D. Lindenmeier, 34, is an inmate at Taylorville Correctional \nCenter in Taylorville, Illinois, and a registered sex offender. He was convicted in \n2007 of predatory criminal sexual assault and sentenced to six years in jail at 85 \npercent, plus an MSR sentence of three years to life.  \n84.  Lindenmeier has completed his prison sentence. The PRB approved \nLindenmeier for release on MSR on July 18, 2011.  \n85.  Lindenmeier has a supportive family and friends outside of prison who \nhave offered to help him successfully serve his MSR. While his family members \ncannot afford to pay for Lindenmeier’s housing, they are willing to take him into \ntheir own homes. \n86.  With the help of these friends and family members, Lindenmeier has \nmade numerous efforts to find compliant housing to satisfy the requirements for his \nrelease from prison on MSR, but IDOC officials have rejected all of his proposed \nhost sites.  \n87.  Lindenmeier has proposed the following locations, each of which was \nrejected: \n•  His father’s home; denied because house is located within 500 feet of \nprohibited location (e.g., school or daycare); \n \n•  His mother’s home; denied because residence contains a computer and \nsmart phone; \n \n•  His girlfriend’s home; denied because house is located within 500 feet \nof prohibited location (e.g., daycare); \n \n•  His sister’s home; denied because his sister has children and a \n\t 18\t\n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/19/16 Page 19 of 34 PageID #:19\nsmartphone; \n \n•  His father’s girlfriend’s home; denied because house is located within \n500 feet of prohibited location (e.g., daycare); and \n \n•  His mother’s boyfriend’s home; denied because house contains a \ncomputer and is located within 500 feet of prohibited location (e.g., \nschool). \n \n88.  Lindenmeier has no other options for obtaining housing outside of \nprison. \n89.  Because his MSR term is indefinite, Lindenmeier faces imprisonment \nin the Illinois Department of Corrections for the rest of his life. Lindenmeier cannot \nmeet the statutory requirements discussed above for an approved “host site,” which \nis necessary for release on MSR. Moreover, he can never apply for termination of his \nMSR period while in prison pursuant to the terms of 730 ILCS 5/3-14-2.5(d), \ndiscussed in ¶23 above. \nKeenon Smith \n90.  Plaintiff Keenon Smith, 19, is an inmate at Pinckneyville Correctional \nCenter in Pinckneyville, Illinois, and is a registered sex offender. He was convicted \nin 2012 of criminal sexual assault, for which he was sentenced to five years in \nprison, plus an MSR term of three years to life.  \n91.  Smith has completed his prison sentence. The PRB approved Smith for \nrelease on MSR on November 4, 2016.  \n92.  To date, the IDOC has not released Smith from prison because he \ncannot find an approved “host site” at which to serve his MSR.  \n\t 19\t\n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/19/16 Page 20 of 34 PageID #:20\n93.  While Smith does not personally have any resources to pay for housing, \nSmith’s mother, who is an elementary school teacher, is willing to take Smith into \nher home or pay for his housing elsewhere at an approved “host site.”  \n94.  Smith’s mother has proposed at least 12 different host sites in Chicago \nand the suburbs, but IDOC has rejected all of the proposed sites, including the \nfollowing:  \n•  Smith’s mother’s home in Calumet City, Illinois; denied because house \nis “a three minute drive” from the victim’s residence;  \n \n•  Four different apartments in Calumet City; denied because too close to \nvarious unidentified prohibited locations (including daycares and \nschools); \n \n•   An apartment in South Holland, Illinois; denied because too close to a \ndaycare; \n \n•  Cornerstone Halfway House in Chicago, Illinois; denied because it will \nnot accept an individual with a sex-related conviction; \n \n•  Four different apartments in Chicago, Illinois; denied because too close \nto various unidentified prohibited locations (including daycares and \nparks); \n \n95.  IDOC officials rejected Smith’s mother’s home as a “host site” on the \nbasis that it was “a three minute drive” to the victim of Smith’s offense.  \n96.  There is no statutory prohibition on an offender’s living a certain \ndriving distance from a victim. \n97.  In fact, the victim’s residence is over 5,000 feet from Smith’s mother’s \nresidence.  \n98.  Illinois law prohibits certain offenders from living within “500 feet” of \ntheir victims. 720 ILCS 5/11-9.3 (b).  \n\t 20\t\n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/19/16 Page 21 of 34 PageID #:21\n99.  IDOC officials would not give Smith’s mother an explanation as to why \nher residence was deemed too close to the victim or what an acceptable distance \nfrom the victim would be.  \n100.  For several other of the addresses Smith’s mother proposed, IDOC \nofficials told her they were too close to a park. Illinois law, however, does not set \nforth a specific distance an individual on MSR must live from a park (as opposed to \na playground). IDOC officials have not told Smith’s mother what an acceptable \ndistance from a park is.  \n101.  Due to the extensive restrictions imposed on where sex offenders can \nlive under state law and the arbitrary way in which IDOC officials apply the \nrestrictions concerning where parolees can live, Smith cannot locate an approved \n“host site,” which is required for release on MSR. Moreover, he can never apply for \ntermination of his MSR period while in prison pursuant to the terms of 730 ILCS \n5/3-14-2.5(d), discussed in ¶23 above. \n102.  Because his MSR term is indefinite, Smith faces imprisonment in the \nIllinois Department of Corrections for the rest of his life. \nJasen Gustafsen \n103.  Plaintiff Jasen Gustafsen, 32, is an inmate at Lincoln Correctional \nCenter in Lincoln, Illinois, and a registered sex offender. He was convicted in 2013 \nof aggravated child pornography, for which he was sentenced to four years in prison \nat 50 percent, plus a term of mandatory supervised release of three years to life.  \n104.  Gustafson earned three months good time, thereby converting his two-\n\t 21\t\n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/19/16 Page 22 of 34 PageID #:22\nyear sentence into a sentence of one year and nine months. He has now completed \nhis prison sentence. The PRB approved Gustafson for release on MSR on October \n19, 2014.  \n105.  Gustafson has no resources to pay for his own housing outside of \nprison. He does, however, have two supportive family members (his mother and his \naunt) who are willing to take him in. While neither his mother nor his aunt can \nafford to pay for Gustafson’s housing elsewhere, they are both willing to house him \nin their own homes while he serves his MSR. \n106.  IDOC officials have rejected both proposed host sites.  \n107.  IDOC officials rejected Gustafson’s mother’s residence because it was \ntoo close to a prohibited location (e.g., a daycare).  \n108.  IDOC officials rejected his aunt’s residence as a host site because she \nhas grandchildren who regularly visit her.  \n109.  Gustafson has no other options for seeking housing outside of prison.  \n110.  Because his MSR is indeterminate, Gustafson faces imprisonment in \nthe Illinois Department of Corrections for the rest of his life. Gustafson cannot meet \nthe statutory requirements discussed above for an approved “host site,” which is \nrequired for release on MSR. Moreover, he can never apply for termination of his \nMSR period while in prison pursuant to the terms of 730 ILCS 5/3-14-2.5(d), \ndiscussed in ¶23 above. \nAlfred Aukema \n111.  Plaintiff Alfred Aukema, 43, is an inmate in Taylorville Correctional \n\t 22\t\n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/19/16 Page 23 of 34 PageID #:23\nCenter in Taylorville, Illinois, and is a registered sex offender. He was convicted in \n2013 of criminal sexual assault, for which he received a five-year prison sentence at \n85 percent, plus a term of mandatory supervised release of three years to life.  \n112.  He is scheduled to complete his five-year sentence on September 7, \n2017.  \n113.  Plaintiff Aukema has no financial resources to afford to pay for a host \nsite and no family or friends outside of prison who can help him pay for housing. \n114.  Because his MSR term is indefinite, Aukema faces imprisonment in \nthe Illinois Department of Corrections for the rest of his life. Aukema will never be \nable to meet the statutory requirements discussed above for an approved “host site,” \nwhich is required for release on MSR. Moreover, he can never apply for termination \nof his MSR period while in prison pursuant to the terms of 730 ILCS 5/3-14-2.5(d), \ndiscussed in ¶23 above. \nKevin Tucek \n115.  Plaintiff Kevin Tucek, 33, is an inmate at Taylorville Correctional \nCenter in Taylorville, Illinois, and a registered sex offender. He was convicted in \n2014 of criminal sexual assault, for which he received an eight-year prison sentence, \nplus a term of mandatory supervised release of three years to life.  \n116.  He is scheduled to complete his prison sentence on July 20, 2020.  \n117.  Plaintiff Tucek has no financial resources to afford to pay for a host \nsite and no family or friends outside of prison who can help him pay for housing. \n118.  Because his MSR term is indefinite, Tucek faces imprisonment in the \n\t 23\t\n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/19/16 Page 24 of 34 PageID #:24\nIllinois Department of Corrections for the rest of his life. Tucek will never be able to \nmeet the statutory requirements discussed above for an approved “host site,” which \nis required for release on MSR. Moreover, he can never apply for termination of his \nMSR period while in prison pursuant to the terms of 730 ILCS 5/3-14-2.5(d), \ndiscussed in ¶23 above. \nClass Allegations \n119.  Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), the named Plaintiffs seek \ncertification of this complaint as a class action. The named Plaintiffs seek to \nrepresent two classes consisting of the following: \n•  Class One: All individuals who have received an MSR \nsentence of three years to life currently detained in the \nIllinois Department of Corrections who have been approved \nfor release on MSR by the PRB but have been denied release \nfrom IDOC custody because of their inability to find an \napproved host site; and  \n \n•  Class Two: All individuals who have received an MSR \nsentence of three years to life currently or in the future \ndetained in the Illinois Department of Corrections who will \nin the future remain detained indefinitely in prison due to \nthe unavailability of host sites.  \n \n120.  The Plaintiff Classes seek a declaration that the statutory schemes \ndescribed above are unconstitutional because they result in routine violations of \nclass members’ constitutional right to liberty in violation of the Eighth and \nFourteenth Amendments.   \n121.  The proposed classes are numerous. Based on data available from the \nIllinois Sex Offender Registry, there are currently approximately 4,000 people \nimprisoned in the Illinois Department of Corrections who have been convicted of sex \n\t 24\t\n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/19/16 Page 25 of 34 PageID #:25\noffenses for which state law imposes an indeterminate term of “three years to life” \nof MSR.  \n122.  Joinder of all class members is impracticable. Not only are the classes \nvery numerous, they are also constantly changing. Class One is consistently \ngrowing because individuals are completing their prison sentences and being \napproved by the PRB for release on MSR. Likewise, Class Two is consistently \nexpanding because additional people are receiving “three to life” MSR terms on a \nroutine basis.  \n123.  There are questions of law and fact common to all class members, \nincluding but not limited to the following: \n•  Does a statutory scheme that results in the extrajudicial imposition of \nlife imprisonment violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments; \n \n•  Does a statutory scheme that deprives individuals of their liberty \nsolely because of their inability to afford housing violate the Equal \nProtection Clause;  \n \n•  Are Illinois statutes regulating where individuals deemed sex \noffenders may reside while on MSR void for vagueness because they \nfail to define what is meant by many of their operative terms and thus \nfail to give sufficient guidance to IDOC officials and to prisoners \nseeking compliant housing \n \n124.  All individuals falling within the class definitions have been subject to \nthe same statutory scheme. Given the commonality of the questions pertinent to all \nclass members, a single declaratory judgment would provide relief to each member \nof the class.  \n\t 25\t\n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/19/16 Page 26 of 34 PageID #:26\n125.  Defendants have acted and continue to act in a manner adverse to the \nrights of the proposed classes, making final declaratory relief appropriate with \nrespect to the classes as a whole. \n126.   Plaintiffs and the classes they seek to represent have been directly \ninjured by the statutory schemes and practices challenged herein; and members of \nthe class are currently at risk of future harm from the continuation of these policies \nand practices. \n127.  Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class; \nand the Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of all members of the proposed \nclass. \n128.   Plaintiffs’ counsel are experienced in civil rights litigation, including \nMonell claims, (b)(2) class actions, and constitutional matters on behalf of \nincarcerated people. Plaintiffs’ counsel will fairly and adequately represent the \ninterests of the class. \nCOUNT I – FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT \nSUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS \n(Against Both Defendants) \n \n129.  Plaintiffs reallege and reincorporate, as though fully set forth herein, \neach and every allegation contained above. \n130.  Under the scheme described above, a prisoner approved for MSR will \nonly be released from prison to an approved “host site” (e.g., housing that complies \nwith all of the restrictions imposed by statute, the IDOC and the PRB). \n\t 26\t\n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/19/16 Page 27 of 34 PageID #:27\n131.   The multiple layers of prohibitions imposed on where individuals can \nlive creates an unmeetable condition (e.g., the restrictions are so onerous that for \nthe vast majority of people approved for MSR they are effectively impossible to \nmeet), forcing those subject to the requirements to spend the duration of their MSR \nterm incarcerated.  \n132.  For those prisoners with an MSR sentence of “three years to life,” those \nunmeetable conditions result in life imprisonment because they can never meet the \nconditions for release from prison on MSR, nor can they meet the conditions for \ntermination of their MSR. \n133.   The three-years-to-life sentence, combined with the onerous housing \nrestrictions results in a prison sentence that exceeds the sentence imposed by the \nsentencing court in such an unexpected manner as to impose a shocking \ninterference on class members’ liberty interests. \n134.   The punishment shocks the conscience because it is far out of \nproportion to the offense. \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Honorable Court: \na)   Issue an order certifying this action to proceed as a class pursuant to \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2); \n \nb)   Appoint the undersigned as class counsel pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(g); \n \nc)   Enter judgment declaring that the housing restrictions described \nherein as applied to the class violate the Fourteenth Amendment of the \nU.S. Constitution; \n \n\t 27\t\n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/19/16 Page 28 of 34 PageID #:28\nd)   Enter a preliminary and then permanent injunction prohibiting \nDefendants from continuing enforcement of the unconstitutional \npolicies and practices identified herein; \n \ne)   Award Plaintiffs their reasonable attorneys’ fees and cost pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. § 1988, and other applicable law; and \n \nf)   Grant such other relief as this Court deems just and proper. \n \nCOUNT II – FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT \nEQUAL PROTECTION \n(Against Both Defendants) \n \n135.  Plaintiffs reallege and reincorporate, as though fully set forth herein, \neach and every allegation contained above. \n136.  Release from prison on MSR involves a liberty interest that cannot be \ndenied simply on the basis of an individual’s poverty.  \n137.  The statutory and regulatory schemes at play here make it impossible \nfor an indigent person sentenced to a “three to life” term of MSR to be released from \nprison.  \n138.  An individual cannot be released from prison unless he has an \napproved “host site” that meets statutory, PRB and IDOC requirements. \n139.  An indigent prisoner without access to financial resources outside of \nprison cannot afford to pay for housing at a “host site.”  \n140.  The state provides no financial resources, housing assistance or \ntransitional housing (“halfway houses”) for individuals who have convictions for sex \nrelated crimes. \n\t 28\t\n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/19/16 Page 29 of 34 PageID #:29\n141.  Life imprisonment is not the only way to serve the government’s \ninterests in knowing the whereabouts of indigent individuals approved for release \non MSR. Rather, the state has alternative means of serving those interests—i.e., by \nsubjecting those individuals to electronic monitoring with GPS. See 730 ILCS 5/3-3-\n7(a)(7.7) (requiring individuals convicted of crimes requiring the imposition of a \n“three to life” MSR term to “wear an approved electronic monitoring device ... that \nhas Global Positioning System (GPS) capability for the duration of the person's \nparole, mandatory supervised release term, or extended mandatory supervised \nrelease term.”) \n142.  Accordingly, the statutory and regulatory schemes at issue in this case \nresult in a severe and permanent deprivation of liberty for indigent persons without \na sufficiently rational connection between the legislative purpose and the means \nused to achieve that purpose. \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Honorable Court: \na)   Issue an order certifying this action to proceed as a class pursuant to \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2); \n \nb)   Appoint the undersigned as class counsel pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(g); \n \nc)   Enter judgment declaring that the housing restrictions described \nherein as applied to the class violate the Equal Protection Clause; \n \nd)   Enter a preliminary and then permanent injunction prohibiting \nDefendants from continuing enforcement of the unconstitutional \npolicies and practices identified herein; \n \ne)   Award Plaintiffs their reasonable attorneys’ fees and cost pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. § 1988, and other applicable law; and \n \n\t 29\t\n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/19/16 Page 30 of 34 PageID #:30\nf)   Grant such other relief as this Court deems just and proper. \n \nCOUNT III – FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT \nPROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS  – VOID FOR VAGUENESS \n(Against Defendant Madigan) \n \n143.  Plaintiffs reallege and reincorporate, as though fully set forth herein, \neach and every allegation contained above. \n144.  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits states \nfrom enforcing laws that are unconstitutionally vague. As a matter of due process, \nstatutory requirements must be written with sufficient clarity that persons of \nordinary intelligence need not guess at their meaning. \n145.  Several of the statutory regulations on where individuals sentenced to \n“three to life” MSR terms may live are invalid under the vagueness doctrine. \n146.  Specifically, the prohibition on living “near” parks, schools, day care \ncenters, swimming pools, beaches, theaters, “or any other places where minor \nchildren congregate,” as set forth in 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(b-1)(12), is unconstitutionally \nvague because it does not define what is meant by “near” and does not define what \nis meant by “places where minor children congregate.”  \n147.   Those provisions fail to provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair \nnotice of what is required to comply with the statute, making it likely that IDOC \nofficials, who have unreviewable discretion to interpret those terms, will enforce the \nstatutes in different ways against different people. \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Honorable Court: \n\t 30\t\n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/19/16 Page 31 of 34 PageID #:31\na)   Issue an order certifying this action to proceed as a class pursuant to \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2); \n \nb)   Appoint the undersigned as class counsel pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(g); \n \nc)   Enter judgment declaring that 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(b-1)(12) is void for \nvagueness; \n \nd)   Enter a preliminary and then permanent injunction prohibiting \nDefendants from continuing enforcement of 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(b-1)(12); \n \ne)   Award Plaintiffs their reasonable attorneys’ fees and cost pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. § 1988, and other applicable law; and \n \nf)   Grant such other relief as this Court deems just and proper. \n \nCOUNT III – FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT \nPROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS  \n(Against Defendant Baldwin)  \n148.  Plaintiffs reallege and reincorporate, as though fully set forth herein, \neach and every allegation contained above. \n149.  Illinois law gives the Illinois Department of Corrections very broad \ndiscretion to deny approval of a “host site” for any reason it sees fit.   \n150.  Specifically, 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7 (b-1) sets forth that anyone deemed a sex \noffender who seeks release on MSR may “reside only at a Department approved \nlocation” and must “comply with all other special conditions that the Department \nmay impose that restrict the person from high-risk situations and limit access to \npotential victims.” \n\t 31\t\n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/19/16 Page 32 of 34 PageID #:32\n151.  The IDOC routinely misuses the discretion it has been granted under \nthis statute to deny approval of proposed “host sites” for reasons not enumerated in \nany statute.  \n152.  Moreover, under 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7 (a)(7.11)(iv) the IDOC can impose \n“any other appropriate restrictions concerning the offender’s use of or access to a \ncomputer or any other device with Internet capability imposed by the Board, the \nDepartment or the offender’s supervising agent.” \n153.  The IDOC routinely misuses the authority granted under this statute \nto prohibit individuals deemed sex offenders from serving their MSR at any host \nsite where any resident owns a computer or smart phone with Internet capability, \nalthough such a blanket prohibition is not set forth in any statute and is not \nreasonably related to any rehabilitative or other legitimate interest. \n154.  The IDOC’s decision to deny approval of a “host site” is not appealable \nand is not reviewed by any other entity. \n155.  A statutory scheme that grants the IDOC excessive and unreviewable \ndiscretion to deny approval of housing and thereby keep individuals who have been \ngranted MSR in prison violates due process. \n156.  Likewise, the IDOC’s misuse of their discretion to deny approval of \nhousing without adequate justification violates due process. \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Honorable Court: \na)   Issue an order certifying this action to proceed as a class pursuant to \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2); \n \n\t 32\t\n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/19/16 Page 33 of 34 PageID #:33\nb)   Appoint the undersigned as class counsel pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(g); \n \nc)   Enter judgment declaring that the terms of 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7 (b-1) and \n730 ILCS 5/3-3-7 (a)(7.11)(iv) violate the Fourteenth Amendment \nbecause they vest excessive discretion with IDOC officials;  \n \nd)  Enter judgment declaring that the IDOC’s policy and practice of \nimposing a blanket prohibition on allowing individuals deemed sex \noffenders to live at host sites where any resident owns a computer or \nsmart phone violates the Fourteenth Amendment;  \n \ne)   Enter a preliminary and then permanent injunction prohibiting \nDefendants from continuing enforcement of 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(b-1)(12); \n \nf)   Award Plaintiffs their reasonable attorneys’ fees and cost pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. § 1988, and other applicable law; and \n \ng)   Grant such other relief as this Court deems just and proper. \n \nCOUNT IV – EIGHTH AMENDMENT \n(Against Both Defendants) \n \n157.  Plaintiffs reallege and reincorporate, as though fully set forth herein, \neach and every allegation contained above. \n158.  A criminal sentence must be proportionate to the crime for which the \ndefendant has been convicted. \n159.  Imposition of an effective life sentence on prisoners entitled to release \non MSR simply because they cannot find housing that complies with the restrictions \non where they are allowed to live is grossly disproportionate and without reasonable \njustification. \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Honorable Court: \na)   Issue an order certifying this action to proceed as a class pursuant to \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2); \n\t 33\t\n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/19/16 Page 34 of 34 PageID #:34\n \nb)   Appoint the undersigned as class counsel pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.

Plaintiffs allege violations \nof their rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments and are bring this action for \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief against Defendants Attorney General Lisa Madigan, in her \nofficial capacity as the Attorney General of Illinois, and John Baldwin, in his official capacity as \nthe director of the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC).  Defendants move to dismiss the \nComplaint on three grounds:  (1) two of the Plaintiffs lack standing because, unlike the other \nPlaintiffs, they have not finished the terms of their incarceration; (2) the relief requested is \nappropriate for a habeas corpus action, not a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action; and (3) Plaintiffs fail to \nallege sufficient facts for their constitutional claims.  The Motion is granted with respect to the \ntwo Plaintiffs with time left in their prison sentences; the Motion is denied on the grounds that it \nshould have been brought as a habeas action; and the constitutional claims stand with the \nexception of the due process claim alleging vagueness. \n1 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 31 Filed: 08/18/17 Page 2 of 24 PageID #:167\nI.  Facts \n  This Court takes the following allegations from the Complaint and treats them as true for \npurposes of this memorandum opinion and order. There are approximately 4,000 individuals \nimprisoned in the IDOC who have been convicted for sex-related offenses for which state law \nimposes three-years to life of “Mandatory Supervised Release” (MSR). (Dkt. 1 at ¶ 3.)  The \nmajority of these individuals are unable to find approved housing (“host sites”) to serve their \nMSR  terms  and  so  their  MSR  sentences  are  in  effect  converted  to  life  sentences  without \npossibility of release.  (Id. at ¶¶ 1, 4.)  The named Plaintiffs fall into this category.  (Id. at ¶ 5.)  \n  Decision makers in IDOC have wide discretion whether or not to release Plaintiffs to \nserve their MSR terms. Individuals convicted of “predatory criminal sexual assault of a child, \naggravated criminal sexual assault” after July 1, 2005, or of “aggravated child pornography … \nmanufacture of child pornography, or dissemination of child pornography” after January 1, 2009, \nare subject to the mandatory imposition of an indeterminate term of MSR “rang[ing] from a \nminimum of three years to a maximum of the natural life.”  730 ILCS 5/5-8-1(d)(4).  A person \nwith an indeterminate MSR sentence of “three years to life” can only apply for termination of his \nMSR after successfully completing three years of MSR outside of prison.  730 ILCS 5/3-14-\n2.5(d); (Id. at ¶ 23.)  \n  Plaintiffs allege that the PRB (Prison Review Board) and IDOC misuse their discretion in \ndetermining whether to approve proposed host sites.  (Dkt. 20 at 16.)  The PRB is responsible for \nestablishing release dates from prison and setting the conditions for release on MSR.  730 ILCS \n5/3-3-1.  (Dkt. 1 at ¶ 24.)  The IDOC retains custody of all prisoners approved for release on \nMSR  by  the  PRB  and  is  charged  with  assuring  that  prisoners  are  in  compliance  with  the \nconditions set by the PRB before they are released from an IDOC facility on MSR.  730 ILCS \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 31 Filed: 08/18/17 Page 3 of 24 PageID #:168\n5/3-14-2.   The IDOC has the sole authority to approve or deny a proposed host site.  (Id. at ¶ \n30.)  The IDOC also has discretion to impose “any other appropriate restrictions concerning the \noffender’s use of or access to a computer or any other device with Internet capability imposed by \nthe Board, the Department or the offender’s supervising agency.”  730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.11)(iv).  \nThe IDOC, pursuant to this authority, routinely prohibits individuals from serving their MSRs at \nany host site where any resident has a computer or smart phone with internet capabilities.  (¶ 51.)  \nPlaintiffs allege that the PRB and IDOC misuse the wide discretion granted under the statutory \nscheme and relevant policies. \n  The PRB and IDOC rely on several sources from the Illinois Code in making their \ndecisions.    For  example,  it  is  unlawful  to  “knowingly  reside  within  500  feet  of  a  school \nbuilding[,]”  720 ILCS 5/11-9.3 (b-5); and there are 4,979 primary and high schools in Illinois.  \n(Dkt. 1 ¶¶ 34, 35.)  It is also unlawful for a sex offender to “knowingly reside within 500 feet of \na playground … [or] day care center” 720 ILCS 5/11-9.3(b-10); and in the City of Chicago there \nare 332 Chicago Park District owned playgrounds and in Illinois there are 9,929 licensed daycare \nproviders.  (Id. at ¶¶ 36–38.) A convicted sex offender also may not reside while on MSR at the \nsame address or in the same condominium/apartment building or trailer park where he knows \nanother convicted sex offender has been placed, unless such housing is an IDOC-approved \nhalfway house or medical facility, 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6); and there are currently no halfway \nhouses in the state of Illinois that accept sex offenders.  (Id. at ¶¶ 41–43.)  Sex offenders are also \nprohibited from “resid[ing] near … parks, schools, day care centers, swimming pools, beaches, \ntheaters, or any other places where minor children congregate[,]” 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(b-1)(12); \nand in the city of Chicago there are 581 parks.  (Id. at ¶ 45.)  There are no definitions of the word \n“near” or “any other places where minor children congregate” in the Code.  (Id. at ¶¶ 46, 47.)   \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 31 Filed: 08/18/17 Page 4 of 24 PageID #:169\nIDOC officials routinely cite the prohibition on living “near” the locations in the statute to deny \nhousing (Id. at ¶ 49.) \nThe Named Plaintiffs \n  Four of the named Plaintiffs have completed their sentences of incarceration and remain \nin prison with indefinite MSR terms.  (Dkt. 1 at ¶ 12, 13.)1  The two other Plaintiffs also have \nindefinite  MSR  terms  and  are  indigent,  but  have  not  yet  completed  their  sentences  of \nincarceration. \nPlaintiff Paul F. Murphy is a prisoner at Taylorville Correctional Center in Taylorville, \nIllinois and a registered sex offender.  (Dkt. 1 at ¶ 12.)  In 2011, Murphy was convicted of \naggravated child pornography, for which he was sentenced to 36 months of probation.  (Id. at ¶ \n63.)  In August 2013 his probation was revoked because while homeless he was arrested for \nsleeping in the doorway of a church.  (Id. at ¶ 64.)  Murphy was then sentenced to three years in \nprison plus two years MSR.  (¶ 65.)  The PRB approved Murphy for release on MSR on March \n3, 2014.  (Id. at ¶ 12.)  Murphy applied for housing at a halfway house in East St. Louis, Illinois.  \n(Id. at ¶ 71.)  At the time he applied, it was the only halfway house in the state that accepted sex \noffenders, but while he was on the waiting list, the halfway house closed.  (Id. at ¶¶ 71-72.)  \nMurphy has no money to pay for housing and no family members outside of prison who can \nprovide financial help.  (Id. at ¶ 12.)   \n  Plaintiff Stanley Meyer is a prisoner at Taylorville and a registered sex offender.  (Dkt. 1 \nat ¶ 13.)  He was convicted in 2008 of criminal sex assault and sentenced to 48 months in jail \nplus an MSR sentence of three years to life.  (Id. at ¶ 77.)  The PRB approved his release on \nMSR on May 12, 2011.  (Id. at ¶ 13.)  Meyer has not been released because he cannot find a host \n                                                 \n1 Plaintiff Keenon Smith has found an approved host site and been released since filing the Complaint.  Plaintiffs \nagree to the dismissal of Plaintiff Smith’s equitable claims as moot. \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 31 Filed: 08/18/17 Page 5 of 24 PageID #:170\nsite.  (Id.)  He has no money to pay for housing and no family members outside of prison who \ncan help.  (Id.)   \n  Plaintiff J.D. Lindenmeier is a prisoner at Taylorville and a registered sex offender (Id. at \n¶ 14.)  He was convicted in 2007 of predatory criminal sexual assault and sentenced to six years \nin jail plus an MSR sentence of three years to life.  (Id. at ¶ 83.)  The PRB approved him for \nrelease on July 18, 2011, but he has not been released because he cannot find an approved host \nsite.  (Id. at ¶ 14.)  Lindenmeier’s family members have made substantial efforts to find a host \nsite.  (Id.)  Lindenmeier has proposed six different host sites with various family members who \nare willing to take him in but the IDOC has rejected all six.  (Id.)  He proposed his father’s home \nwhich the IDOC denied because the house is within 500 feet of a prohibited location.  (Id. at ¶ \n87.)  He proposed his mother’s home which the IDOC denied because her residence contains a \ncomputer and smart phone.  (Id.)  He proposed his girlfriend’s home which the IDOC denied \nbecause it is within 500 feet of a prohibited location.  (Id.)  He proposed his sister’s home which \nthe IDOC denied because she has children and a smart phone.  (Id.)  The IDOC denied his \nfather’s girlfriend’s home because it is within 500 feet of prohibited location.  (Id.)  The IDOC \ndenied his mother’s boyfriend’s home because the house contains a computer and is located \nwithin 500 feet of prohibited location.  (Id.) \n  Plaintiff Jason Gustafsen is a prisoner at Lincoln Correctional Center in Lincoln, Illinois \nand a registered sex offender.  (Dkt. 1 at ¶ 16.)  He was convicted in 2013 of aggravated child \npornography, for which he was sentenced to four years in prison at 50 percent plus a term of \nMSR of three years to life.  (Id. at ¶ 103.)  He earned three months good time, thereby converting \nhis sentence to one year and nine months.  (Id. at ¶ 104.) The PRB approved Gustafsen for \nrelease on MSR on October 19, 2014.  (Id. at ¶ 16.)  He has no financial resources of his own and \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 31 Filed: 08/18/17 Page 6 of 24 PageID #:171\nno family members who are able to pay for his housing outside of prison.  (Id. at ¶ 16.)  His only \noptions are to stay with his mother or his aunt.  (Id. at ¶ 16.)  The IDOC rejected his mother’s \nhome because it is too close to a prohibited location and his aunt’s home because she has \ngrandchildren who regularly visit her.  (Id. at ¶¶ 107, 108.)  \nThe remaining two Plaintiffs have not completed their sentences of incarceration.  Alfred \nAukema is a prisoner at Taylorville and a registered sex offender.  (Dkt. 1 at ¶ 17.)  He was \nconvicted in 2013 of criminal sexual assault for which he received a five-year prison sentence  \nplus a term of mandatory supervised release of three years to life.  (Id. at ¶ 111.)  He is scheduled \nto complete his five-year prison sentence on September 7, 2017.  (Id. at ¶ 17.)  He has no \nfinancial resources to pay for a host site and no friends or family outside of prison who can take \nhim in or pay for his housing.  Plaintiff Kevin Tucek is a prisoner at Taylorville and a registered \nsex offender.  (Id. at ¶ 18.)  He was convicted in 2014 of criminal sexual assault for which he \nreceived an eight-year prison sentence plus MSR of three years to life.  He is scheduled to \ncomplete his eight-year prison sentence on July 20, 2020.  (Id. at ¶ 18.)  Tucek has no financial \nresources to afford to pay for his housing.  (Id. at ¶ 18.)  His indefinite MSR period will in all \nlikelihood result in a lifetime imprisonment.  (Id. at ¶ 18.) \nII.  The Standard of Review \n  In order to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon \nwhich relief may be granted, a complaint “must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as \ntrue, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6); Ashcroft v. \nIqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 \n(2007)).  “A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads sufficient factual content that \nallows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 31 Filed: 08/18/17 Page 7 of 24 PageID #:172\nalleged.”  Adams v. City of Indianapolis, 742 F.3d 720, 728 (7th Cir. 2014) (quoting Ashcroft v. \nIqbal, 556 U.S. at 678).  \n  Defendants move to dismiss the Complaint on three grounds.  First, Defendants assert \nthat two of the Plaintiffs’ claims are not ripe because they have not yet completed their terms of \nincarceration.  Next, Defendants move to dismiss the Complaint because their claims fall within \nthe scope of habeas corpus rather than 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Finally, Defendants move to dismiss \neach of Plaintiffs’ individual constitutional claims: substantive due process; Eighth Amendment; \nequal protection; procedural due process; and Plaintiffs’ claim that the residency restrictions in \nthe Illinois Code is void for vagueness.  \nIII.  Ripeness \n  Defendants assert that Alfred Aukema and Kevin Tucek’s claims should be dismissed \nbecause they have not completed their sentences and therefore their claims are not ripe for \nreview.  (Dkt. 20 at ¶ 10.)  “Ripeness is a justiciability doctrine designed ‘to prevent the courts, \nthrough  avoidance  of  premature  adjudication,  from  entangling  themselves  in  abstract \ndisagreements  over  administrative  policies,  and  also  to  protect  the  agencies  from  judicial \ninterference until an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete \nway by the challenging parties.’”  Nat’l Park Hosp. Ass’n v. Dep’t of Interior, 538 U.S. 803, \n807–08 (2003) (quoting Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148–149 (1967); accord, \nOhio Forestry Assn., Inc. v. Sierra Club, 523 U.S. 726, 732–733 (1998).).  “The ripeness \ndoctrine is “drawn both from Article III limitations on judicial power and from prudential \nreasons for refusing to exercise jurisdiction[.]”  Id. (internal quotations omitted).  To determine \nwhether an action is of “sufficient immediacy and reality” for judicial review requires the court \nto evaluate “(1) the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and (2) the hardship to the parties of \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 31 Filed: 08/18/17 Page 8 of 24 PageID #:173\nwithholding court consideration.”  Id. (quoting Abbott Laboratories, 387 U.S. at 149.)  “Both \naspects of the inquiry involve the exercise of judgment, rather than the application of a black-\nletter rule.”  Id. \n  Turning to whether the issues are fit for judicial decision, Aukema and Tucek fear that \nbecause they do not have the financial resources, they will not be able to find approved housing \nupon completion of their sentences and therefore they will be incarcerated for life.  (Dkt. 1 at ¶ \n12, 23.)  However, determining now whether their circumstances will remain the same upon their \nrelease requires impermissible speculation.  See Wisconsin Right to life State Political Action \nCommittee v. Barland, 664 F.3d 139, 148 (7th Cir. 2011) (“Ripeness concerns may arise when a \ncase involves uncertain or contingent events that may not occur as anticipated, or not occur at \nall.”) (internal citations omitted). Aukema’s sentence of incarceration will be completed on \nSeptember 27, 2017 and Tucek’s on July 20, 2020.  Although it is true that they may face the \nsame conundrum as the other Plaintiffs, the Court cannot assume that to be the case.  Until they \nhave each gone through the process and proposed sites have been rejected by IDOC, the Court \ncannot assume that no suitable residence will be located for them to serve out their MSR periods.  \nThe Court likewise cannot assume that the relevant laws will remain in effect and unamended.   \n  Other courts have similarly dismissed claims as premature when a prisoner challenges \npost-release conditions while still in physical custody.  In Kirby v. Siegelman, a convicted sex \noffender brought § 1983 claim challenging the Alabama Community Notification Act that, upon \nhis release from prison, required him to notify victims and neighbors of his offender status.  195 \nF.3d 1285, 1290 (11th Cir. 1999).  But because Kirby had not yet been released, the Eleventh \nCircuit determined that adjudication of his post-release condition was not ripe because he had not \nyet suffered an injury.  Id. See also United States v. Veal, 322 F.3d 1275 (11th Cir. 2003) \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 31 Filed: 08/18/17 Page 9 of 24 PageID #:174\n(applying the Kirby holding, challenge to sex offender registration law was not ripe while \nprisoner was still in prison).  Outside of the sex offender context, courts have also rejected claims \nas unripe which challenge post-release conditions while a plaintiff is still in the prison’s physical \ncustody.  In Carver v. Chapman, for example, prison regulations permitted early release when a \nprisoner participated in a residential drug abuse treatment program.  Carver v. Chapman, 2009 \nWL 1651512 (N.D. Tex. May 21, 2009).  The plaintiff challenged the categorical exclusion of \ninmates  with  felony  convictions  involving  firearms  from  eligibility  but  the  district  court \ndetermined her claims were not ripe because she had not yet participated in and successfully \ncompleted a drug abuse program and therefore had not been denied reduction.  Id. at *2; see also, \ne.g., U.S. v. Charmichael, 343 F.3d 756, 761–762 (5th Cir. 2003) (plaintiffs’ challenge to the \nconstitutionality of DNA sampling during supervised release not ripe because plaintiffs had not \nyet been released); see also, e.g., Themeus v. ICE, No. 15 C 39, 2015 WL 3952708 (N.D. Fla \nJune 29, 2015) (challenge to future ICE detention not ripe because plaintiff was still in prison \nand therefore the removal period had not begun); see also, e.g., Israel v. Dr. Worral, et al., No. \n14 C 158, 2014 WL 7212958 (D. Alaska December 17, 2014) (plaintiff’s § 1983 claim based on \na future discretionary parole was not ripe while he was still in prison); see also, e.g., Abreu v. \nAyers, No. 98-3099, 1998 WL 544968 (N.D. Cal. August 17, 1998) (plaintiff’s safety concerns \nabout being released into general population was not ripe when his placement post-release from a \nsecurity housing unit had not yet been determined.) \nAukema and Tucek are similarly attempting to bring a claim based on post-release MSR \nconditions when they have not yet been released on MSR.  They have not yet suffered an injury.  \nIf they are denied housing when their sentences are complete, then their claims will ripen, but in \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 31 Filed: 08/18/17 Page 10 of 24 PageID #:175\nthe meantime, they cannot bring a claim constructed on speculation.  Accordingly, Aukema and \nTucek’s potential future problem is not ripe and dismissal of their claims is proper. \nIV.  Title 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n  Next, Defendants move to dismiss the Complaint as barred by the Heck doctrine because \nthe claims fall in the scope of habeas corpus.  Both “42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the federal habeas \ncorpus statue, 28 U.S.C. § 2254 provide access to a federal forum for claims of unconstitutional \ntreatment at the hands of state officials, but they differ in their scope and operation.”  Heck v. \nHumphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 480 (1994).  The Court must therefore determine whether Plaintiffs’ \nclaims fall in the purview of § 1983 or habeas corpus.   \nA brief overview of Heck and its progeny provides a useful starting point in this analysis.  \nIn  Heck,  a  prisoner  alleged  that  state  officials  conducted  an  arbitrary  investigation,  had \nknowingly  destroyed  exculpatory  evidence,  and  had  caused  an  illegal  voice  identification \nprocedure to be used at the plaintiff’s criminal trial.  512 U.S. at 479.  The prisoner in Heck was \nnot  specifically  seeking  immediate  or  speedier  release,  but  because  his  damages  claim \nchallenged the legality of his conviction, the § 1983 claim was dismissed.  Id. at 481.  Heck \ntherefore directs the district courts to “consider whether a judgment in favor of the plaintiff \nwould necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence,” and if it does then “the \ncomplaint must be dismissed unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that the conviction or sentence \nhas already been invalidated.”  Id. at 486–487.  Next, in Edwards v. Balisok, a prisoner brought a \n§ 1983 action and alleged that his hearing officer had concealed exculpatory witness statements \nin a hearing on the prisoner’s rule infractions; the finding caused him to lose 30 days of good \ncredit.  520 U.S. 641, 643, 646 (1997).  Because his claim was based on allegations of the \nhearing officer’s deceit and bias, it necessarily implied the invalidity of the punishment imposed \n10 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 31 Filed: 08/18/17 Page 11 of 24 PageID #:176\nand therefore was not cognizable under § 1983.  Id. at 648.  In its holding, Edwards made clear \nthat Heck extends to the decisions of prison disciplinary tribunals, like the Defendants who \ndetermine housing in the instant case.  Defendants also support their Heck theory with citations \nto several district court cases, such as Lacy v. Unknown Parole Agent, that applied the Heck \ndoctrine and prohibited a plaintiff from challenging a PRB decision to revoke MSR.  No. 12 C \n9407, 2012 WL 6217529 at *2 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 12, 2012).   \nPlaintiffs’ claims do not fall in line with the Heck cases, however, because here the \nclaims do not “necessarily imply the invalidity” of Plaintiffs’ sentences but instead challenge the \nconstitutionality of the procedures applied by Defendants in determining MSR.  Heck, 512 U.S. \nat 486–487 (emphasis added); see also Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. 1 (1998) (“If, for example, \npetitioner were to seek damages ‘for using the wrong procedures, not for reaching the wrong \nresult,’ and if that procedural defect did not ‘necessarily imply the invalidity of’ the revocation, \nthen Heck would have no application [at] all.”)  See also Wilkinson v. Dotson 544 U.S. 74, 78 \n(2005) (Ohio’s argument that plaintiffs should have brought their action under habeas “lies in its \njump from a true premise (that in all likelihood the prisoners hope these actions will help bring \nabout earlier release) to a faulty conclusion (that habeas is their sole avenue for relief).”)  In \nHeck, Edwards, and Lacy, each of the plaintiffs’ claims necessarily implied the invalidity of \neither the prisoner’s conviction (Heck) or disciplinary board’s sanction (Edwards) or revocation \nof MSR (Lacy).  In none of the cases did the plaintiffs attack the constitutionality of the \nprocedures themselves.  See, e.g., Id. at *3 (plaintiff conceded that he had received the required \nprocess for the MSR revocation.). \nFurthermore, while in Edwards the claim of deceit and bias on the part of the decision \nmaker fell in the purview of habeas, the case was remanded on plaintiff’s claim for prospective \n11 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 31 Filed: 08/18/17 Page 12 of 24 PageID #:177\ninjunctive relief because that claim would “not necessarily imply the invalidity” of his loss of \ngood time credits.  Edwards requested injunctive relief to correct the prison officials’ consistent \nfailure to date-stamp witness statements upon receipt.  520 U.S. 648–649.  Plaintiffs’ claims are \nmore similar to Edwards’ attack on the process of date stamping than to his claim of deceit and \nbias.  In their Complaint, Plaintiffs request that the Court enter a judgment declaring the statutory \nscheme violates the Eighth Amendment, enter a preliminary and then permanent injunction \nprohibiting Defendants from continuing the unconstitutional policies and practices, and award \nattorneys’ fees and costs.  (Dkt. 1 at 33–34.)  Plaintiffs do not allege unlawful acts of the \ndecision  makers  that  would  necessarily  overturn  the  decision  denying  them  housing  like \nEdwards’ deceit and bias claim. Instead, Plaintiffs allege that the procedure for determining \nhousing is unconstitutional and, like Edwards’ claim for injunctive relief, that claim is properly \nbrought under § 1983.2  Should Plaintiffs prevail, some of the Plaintiffs may, hypothetically, be \nreleased on MSR because under constitutional procedures because the Defendants may be more \nlikely  approve  proposed  host  sites.    The  possibility  of  this  outcome,  however,  does  not \nnecessarily imply the validity of their sentences and therefore the claims are not barred by the \nHeck doctrine. \nThis conclusion is also consistent with Graham v. Broglin: “[i]f the prison is seeking \nwhat can fairly be described as a quantum change in the level of custody … then habeas corpus \nis his remedy.  But if he is seeking a different program or location or environment, then he is \n                                                 \n2 Similarly, Justice Ginsburg concurred in Edwards only with the understanding that had the prisoner alleged other \nprocedural defects, such as the failure of prison officials to specify what facts and evidence supported the finding of \nguilt, that“[a] defect of this order, unlike the principal ‘deceit and bias’ procedural defect [prisoner] alleged … \nwould not necessarily imply the invalidity of the deprivation of his good-time credits, and therefore is immediately \ncognizable under § 1983.  Id. at 649–650.   \n \n12 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 31 Filed: 08/18/17 Page 13 of 24 PageID #:178\nchallenging the conditions rather than the fact of his confinement and his remedy is under civil \nrights law[.]”  922 F.2d 379, 381 (7th Cir. 1991).   \nDefendants  rely  on  Graham  and  assert  that  Plaintiffs  here  are  seeking  a  “quantum \nchange” in custody and therefore are barred by Heck.  The plaintiff in Graham brought a habeas \ncorpus challenge of a denial of his eligibility for a work release program but his claim should \nhave been brought as a civil rights suit: “[t]he line is not a sharp one, and work release falls \nsmack in the middle.  But since we must choose, we think it is closer to the second pole than to \nthe first.”  Id. at 381.  It follows that if a challenge to denial of a work release decision is not a \n“quantum” change, then neither would a challenge to the decision of MSR.  Both work release \nand MSR involve a change in location that, while less restrictive than prison, are a continuation \nof the sentence.  Defendants do not clarify the distinction between the two but suggest that under \nGraham  “claims  of  entitlement  to  probation,  bond,  parole  fall  within  the  Heck  rule,”  and \ntherefore Plaintiffs’ claims are barred.  (Dkt. 20 at 10.)  However, Plaintiffs do not claim \n“entitlement” to parole or MSR.  Plaintiffs claim entitlement to a constitutional process in \ndetermining whether they will be released on MSR, not to release on MSR.  Richmond v. \nScibana clarifies the distinction first outlined in Graham: “a prisoner claiming a right to release \non parole must use § 2241 (or § 2254 for a state prisoner); but a prisoner claiming that parole \nofficials are apt to use incorrect rules when resolving a future application must use the APA (or \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 for a state prisoner).”  387 F.3d 602, 605 (7th Cir. 2004).  Here, Plaintiffs do \nnot claim a right to release but instead that officials are using unconstitutional rules.  Therefore, \nGraham and Richmond support Plaintiffs’ claims as properly brought under § 1983. \n13 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 31 Filed: 08/18/17 Page 14 of 24 PageID #:179\nV.  Substantive Due Process Claim \n  Defendants assert that Plaintiffs’ substantive due process claim fails because claims \nbased on the constitutionality of criminal punishments are properly analyzed under the Eighth \nAmendment and therefore the substantive due process claim is duplicative.  (Dkt. 20 at 13.)    \n  Relying on Albright v. Oliver, Defendants argue that, “[w]here a particular Amendment \nprovides  an  explicit  textual  source  of  constitutional  protection  against  a  particular  sort  of \ngovernment behavior, that Amendment, not the more generalized notion of ‘substantive due \nprocess,’ must be the guide for analyzing these claims.”  510 U.S. 266, 273 (1994).  In Albright, \nthe issue was straightforward.  The plaintiff asked the court to recognize a substantive right \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment to be free from criminal prosecution except upon probable \ncause.   The Fourth Amendment, however, requires a judicial determination of probable cause as \na prerequisite to any extended restraint on liberty following an arrest.  Id. at 274 (citing Gerstein \nv. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 114 (1975)). \nThe connection between these facts and a specific amendment is not as obvious as the \nconnection  between  probable  cause  and  the  Fourth  Amendment  in  Albright.  Defendants’ \nargument therefore oversimplifies a “difficult question.”  Werner v. Wall, 836 F.3d 751, 766 (7th \nCir. 2016).  In Werner, a sex offender brought a § 1983 claim alleging Eighth Amendment and \ndue process violations in relation to his multiple detentions before he moved into an approved \nresidence.  Werner acknowledged, but never resolved, the “difficult question” as to whether the \ntreatment of detained individuals not subject to sentences of incarceration, like the Plaintiffs in \nthis case, is appropriately analyzed under the Eighth Amendment or substantive due process.  Id. \nat 760–761.  For example, an error in the computation of a sentence implicates the Eighth \nAmendment while treatment of a pretrial prisoner is governed by substantive standards of Due \n14 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 31 Filed: 08/18/17 Page 15 of 24 PageID #:180\nProcess.    Id.    Ultimately,  the  appellate  court  found  defendants  were  entitled  to  qualified \nimmunity and never attempted to reconcile the constitutional tension.  Nevertheless, Werner \ncontemplates that the same factual nucleus might raise both Eighth Amendment and substantive \ndue process principles. \nCertainly at this early stage of litigation, Plaintiffs’ claims are not sufficiently developed \nto determine whether the claims fit more properly under substantive due process or the Eighth \nAmendment. A plaintiff is allowed to plead duplicative claims or claims in the alternative: “[a] \nparty may set out 2 or more statements of a claim … alternatively or hypothetically, either in a \nsingle count … or in separate ones.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(d)(2).  The argument the claim is \nduplicative holds no water and Plaintiffs’ may proceed on their substantive due process claims. \nVI.  Eighth Amendment  \n  Defendants also argue that, should the Court allow Plaintiffs to proceed on both the \nsubstantive due process and Eighth Amendment claims that Plaintiffs nevertheless fail to state a \nclaim  under  the  Eighth  Amendment  because  the  Constitution  does  not  require  strict \nproportionality between a crime and its punishment.  Defendants further argue that Plaintiffs \nhave not alleged that they have been effectively given life sentences, but even if they had, that \nPlaintiffs were charged with Class X felonies which may be punished with a sentence of up to \nnatural life in prison.   \nProtection  from  disproportionate  sentences  is  just  one  of  the  Eighth  Amendment’s \nprotections.  The Amendment circumscribes the criminal process in three ways: “[f]irst, it limits \nthe kinds of punishment that can be imposed on those convicted of crimes; second, it proscribes \npunishment  grossly  disproportionate  to  the  severity  of  the  crime;  and  third,  it  imposes \nsubstantive limits on what can be made criminal and punished as such.”  Ingraham v. Wright, \n15 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 31 Filed: 08/18/17 Page 16 of 24 PageID #:181\n430 U.S. 651, 667-668 (1977) (internal citations omitted).  In particular, “[a] plaintiff states a \nclaim for an Eighth Amendment violation if he is detained in jail for longer than he should have \nbeen due to the deliberate indifference of corrections officials.”  Childress v. Walker, 787 F.3d \n433, 439 (7th Cir. 2015).  Defendants only moved to dismiss based on the second circumscribed \nprotection, but Plaintiffs’ claim is not based on proportionality. \nPlaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that Defendants were deliberately indifferent in failing \nto release them and therefore state a claim.  See, e.g., Stepney v. Johnson, 2016 WL 5720367 \n(N.D. Ill. 2016) (plaintiff stated an Eighth Amendment claim by alleging that prison officials \nknew  that  he  was  eligible  for  release  and  deliberately  held  him  beyond  his  period  of \nincarceration.)    According  to  the  Complaint,  Defendants  knew  that  Plaintiffs  did  not  have \nfinancial resources to find housing, that there are no halfway houses that take sex-offenders in \nIllinois, and still rejected proposed host sites leading to indefinite incarceration.  Based on these \nallegations, it is hard to envision an acceptable host site for an indigent prisoner: to find a house \nin 2017 without a smart phone is in it of itself a near impossible task.  Taken together with the \nwide discretion Defendants have in making their housing determinations, the rejections of host \nsites which results in Plaintiffs’ indefinite incarceration may constitute deliberate indifference.  \nChildress, 787 F.3d at 439.  These allegations are therefore sufficient to support their Eighth \nAmendment claim.   \nVII.  Equal Protection Claim \n  The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment commands that no state shall \n“deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws,” which essentially is \na direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.  U.S. Const. Amend. XIV, \nVision Church v. Vill. of Long Grove, 468 F.3d 975, 1000 (7th Cir. 2006).   Often an equal \n16 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 31 Filed: 08/18/17 Page 17 of 24 PageID #:182\nprotection violation occurs when a regulation draws distinctions among people based on a \nperson’s membership in a “suspect” class.  Martin v. Shawano–Gresham Sch. Dist., 295 F.3d \n701,  712  (7th  Cir.  2002).    Suspect  classes  include  race,  alienage,  and  national  origin  and \nlegislative action that classifies on any of these bases are subject to “strict scrutiny and [it] will \nbe sustained only if [it is] suitably tailored to serve a compelling state interest.”  Vision Church, \n468 F.3d at 1000 (citing City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 440 (1985)).  \nWhen a statute burdens a person’s fundamental constitutional rights, courts also apply strict \nscrutiny. Id.  If neither suspect class nor fundamental right is asserted, the Court applies rational \nreview to determine whether the legislative act is constitutional. Id. at 1000-01.  \n  Plaintiffs assert that the statutory scheme requiring Plaintiffs to obtain compliant housing \nbefore being released on MSR discriminates against those who are too poor to afford housing.  \n(Dkt. 23 at 11.)  Plaintiffs concede, however, that indigent persons are not considered a suspect \nclass under Equal Protection jurisprudence, but nevertheless argue for strict scrutiny under the \ntheory that a fundamental right is implicated: freedom from bodily restraint.  (Id.)  Put another \nway, the permanent imprisonment of indigent sex offenders violates Plaintiffs’ fundamental right \nto freedom from bodily restraint requiring heightened review under the equal protection clause.   \n  Freedom from bodily restraint is a recognized fundamental right protected by the equal \nprotection clause.  See Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U.S. 71, 73, 83 (1992); see also, e.g., Ebonie S. \nv. Pueblo School Dist. 60, 695 F.3d 1051 (recognizing freedom  from bodily restraint is a \nfundamental right under equal protection); see also, e.g., Hydrick v. Hunter, 500 F.3d 978, 983 \n(9th Cir. 2007) (same), vacated on other grounds, 556 U.S. 1256 (2009).  In Foucha, the plaintiff \nhad been civilly committed under the then-Louisiana state process that “allow[ed] a person \nacquitted by reason of insanity to be committed to a mental institution until he is able to \n17 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 31 Filed: 08/18/17 Page 18 of 24 PageID #:183\ndemonstrate that he is not dangerous to himself and others, even though he does not suffer from \nany mental illness.” 504 U.S. at 73.  The Louisiana state appellate court rejected the plaintiff’s \nargument that his equal protection rights were violated by the statutory scheme that allowed \nconfinement  of  an  insanity  acquittee  based  on  dangerousness  alone.    The  Supreme  Court \nreversed: “[f]reedom from physical restraint being a fundamental right, the State must have a \nparticularly convincing reason, which it has not put forward, for such discrimination against \ninsanity acquittees who are no longer mentally ill.”  Id. at 86.  Undercutting Louisiana’s stated \nrationale for the statute, to protect the community from danger, the court pointed out that \ncriminals who have completed their terms are an “obvious and large category of such persons” \nwho also cannot prove they are not a danger but are nevertheless released on the completion of \ntheir sentence.  Therefore, there was no particularly convincing reason for discriminating against \ninsanity acquitees.   \n  Like insanity aquitees, indigent prisoners are not a suspect class.  Nevertheless, the same \nfundamental right is a stake here as was in Foucha.  And as Foucha recognized, just as criminals \nas a group are an “obvious” category of people who might not be able to prove that they are no \nlonger a danger upon the completion of their sentences, nothing in the pleadings suggest that \nindigent  sex  offenders  are  more  of  a  danger  to  the  community  than  those  with  financial \nresources.  For example, there is no particularly convincing reason for individuals such as \nLindenmeier, whose custodial sentence ended in 2011 and has proposed at least six different host \nsites, to continue to sit in prison, on the taxpayer’s dime, because of his indigent status.  There is \nno reason to believe that if Lindenmeir could afford to live alone that he would be less of a \ndanger than if he were to live in one of the six host sites.  There is also no particularly \nconvincing reason for giving Defendants unfettered discretion in approving housing, such that \n18 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 31 Filed: 08/18/17 Page 19 of 24 PageID #:184\ntheir decision making process allows them to entirely bar indigent sex offenders’ release from \nprison.  Plaintiff Stanley Meyer was convicted in 2008 and sentenced to 48 months in prison.  He \nhas already sat in prison more than three years beyond the completion of his sentence and with \nno end in sight.  Undoubtedly the state has an interest in protecting the community from sex \noffenders, but turning a four year sentence into an indefinite one when there has been no further \ncriminal conduct is an obvious offense to Meyer’s fundamental right to freedom from bodily \nrestraint.3  The equal protection claim survives at this stage. \nVIII.  Procedural Due Process  \n  Next, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs fail to state a claim for violations of procedural due \nprocess because Plaintiffs had notice and an opportunity to be heard with respect to the IDOC’s \ndecisions. (Dkt. 20 at 19.)  To succeed in a procedural due process claim, the Plaintiffs must \nprove that: (1) they have a cognizable liberty interest under the Fourteenth Amendment; (2) they \nwere deprived of that liberty interest; and (3) the deprivation was without due process.  Mann v. \nVogel,  707  F.3d  872,  877  (7th  Cir.  2013).    “Due  process  requires  government  to  follow \nreasonable  procedures  for  minimizing  mistaken  deprivations  of  liberty.”    Atkins  v.  City  of \nChicago, 631 F.3d 823, 827 (7th Cir. 2010). \n  Defendants assert that because Plaintiffs are part of the same class as those in Murdock v. \nWalker, where the district court held that the plaintiffs did not have a procedural due process \nclaim, that Plaintiffs are bound to the same conclusion here.  2014 WL 916992 (N.D. Ill. 2013).  \nIn Murdock, plaintiffs, like those here, were sex-offender inmates who were never released on \nMSR  due  to  lack  of  an  approved  housing  location.    The  plaintiffs  in  Murdock  brought  a \n                                                 \n3 As Winston Churchill observed, “[n]othing can be more abhorrent to democracy than to \nimprison a person or keep him in prison because he is unpopular.  This is really the test of \ncivilization.”   \n \n19 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 31 Filed: 08/18/17 Page 20 of 24 PageID #:185\nprocedural due process claim challenging the prison’s “turnaround procedure.”  The turnaround \npolicy specifically referred to the IDOC’s practice of “literally walk[ing] the person to the front \ngate of the jail as if he was about to be released.  But then, instead of releasing the inmate, the \njail  employee  handed  the  inmate  a  notice  informing  him  that  he  had  violated  the  housing \nrequirement of his release[,]” and were then taken back into custody.  Id. at *3.  The plaintiffs in \nMurdock further had a procedural due process claim based on the fact that they did not receive \nadequate notice as to why or how their home was unsuitable.  The district court held on summary \njudgment that the plaintiffs had not shown that the turnaround procedure failed to provide them \nwith adequate notice under the due process clause.  Id. at *12. \nThe Court faces at least three threshold issues with Defendants’ reliance on Murdock.  \nFirst, Defendants ask the Court to accept that the classes are the same without any support for \nthat proposition.  There are no proposed legal guideposts for determining whether two classes in \ntwo separate cases are the same class.  And there are some obvious distinctions between the \nclasses  in  the  two  cases.    For  example,  the  descriptions  of  the  classes  are  not  identical.  \nAccording to the Complaint, “The named Plaintiffs are individuals currently being held in the \ncustody of the Illinois Department of Corrections who have been sentenced to serve ‘three years \nto life’ MSR terms and are unable to find ‘host sites.’”  (Dkt. 1 ¶ 5.)  In Murdock, the district \ncourt describes the class as “past, current, and future Illinois sex-offender inmates who were (or \nwill be) approved for release from prison, either on parole or under [MSR].  The Plaintiffs were \nnot (or will not be) actually released from prison on their release date, however, because they \nlack an approved housing location.”  Id. at *1.  In the instant case, Plaintiffs more specifically \nhave been sentenced to three years to life, a specification apparently not applicable to the class in \nMurdock.  Second, while this case is at the pleading stage and has not reached class certification, \n20 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 31 Filed: 08/18/17 Page 21 of 24 PageID #:186\nthe district court had the benefit of a complete record at summary judgment in Murdock.  This \nmakes it even more difficult to do a meaningful comparison of the classes.  Third, Defendants \nonly cite to Johnson v. Meriter without any parenthetical or further analysis to suggest that case \nstates that one district court’s conclusion is binding on a class in any other litigation the class \nbrings.  Johnson v. Meriter Health Services Employee Retirement Plan, 702 F.3d 364 (7th Cir. \n2012).    But  in  Johnson,  one  district  court  determined  class  certification  for  benefit  plan \nparticipants’ claim under ERISA and analyzed whether divided certification was appropriate.  \nThe district court did not consider the class before it in any other case or any conclusions made \nby another district court as Defendants ask the Court to do here and nothing else in Johnson \nsupports Defendants’ theory. \nBut even if the plaintiffs in Murdock represent the same class as the Plaintiffs here (sex \noffenders  with  indeterminate  MSR  sentences  who  cannot  find  approved  host  sites),  the \nprocedural due process claims are distinguishable.  Plaintiffs do not mention the turnaround \npractice nor do they bring a claim based on inadequate notice.  Instead, Plaintiffs allege that \n“[t]he IDOC routinely misuses the discretion it has been granted under this statute to deny \napproval of proposed ‘host sites” for reasons not enumerated in any statute.”  (Dkt. 1 at ¶ 151.)  \n“[T]he  IDOC’s  misuse  of  their  discretion  to  deny  approval  of  housing  without  adequate \njustification violates due process.”  (Id. at ¶ 156.)  Because Plaintiffs are not challenging the \nsame procedures in their procedural due process claims, the decision in Murdock does not \nforeclose their action. \n  Defendants further assert that Plaintiffs only set forth facts to support a substantive due \nprocess claim, not a procedural one.  (Dkt. 24 at 13.)  In support of this argument, Defendants \ncite to Strasburger v. Bd. of Educ., Hardin Cty. Cmty. Unit Sch. Dist. No. 1, in which a former \n21 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 31 Filed: 08/18/17 Page 22 of 24 PageID #:187\nteacher challenged the substance of the government’s decision in terminating him.  143 F.3d 351, \n357 (7th Cir. 1998).  It logically follows that because the teacher challenged the substance of the \ndecision, substantive due process applied, “as opposed to challenging the process the decision-\nmakers used on procedural due process grounds.”  Id. at 357.  Here, Plaintiffs are challenging \n“the  process  the  decision  makers  used,”  and  therefore,  as  contemplated  by  Strasburger, \nprocedural  due  process  is  the  appropriate  claim.    This  is  similar  to  the  Court’s  previous \ndiscussion in the context of the Heck doctrine: Plaintiffs are challenging the procedures, not the \nresult.  Dismissal of the procedural due process claims, therefore, is not appropriate. \nIX.  Void for Vagueness \n  Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiffs procedural  due  process  claim  that  the  statute \ngranting parole agents the authority to restrict where individuals on MSR can reside, 730 ILCS \n5/3-3-7(b-1)(12), is void for vagueness.  Specifically, the statute prohibits anyone deemed a sex \noffender from “resid[ing] near ... parks, schools, day care centers, swimming pools, beaches, \ntheaters, or any other places where minor children congregate” without prior approval of the \nIllinois Department of Corrections while on MSR. Dkt. 1 at 12.  Plaintiffs allege that the terms \n“near” and “other places where minor children congregate” are void for vagueness. \n  Outside the context of the First Amendment, “a plaintiff can only succeed in a facial \nchallenge by “establish[ing] that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be \nvalid,” i.e., that the law is unconstitutional in all of its applications.”  Washington State Grange \nv. Washington State Republican Party, 552 U.S. 442, 449 (2008) (citing United States v. Salerno, \n481 U.S. 739 (1987)).  Plaintiffs do not contest that theirs is a facial challenge to the statute.  \nPlaintiffs also do not contend their claim implicates the First Amendment.4  Because Plaintiffs \n                                                 \n4 Although numerous First Amendment implications are referenced in the Complaint factually, for example, in the \nprohibition on host sites with internet access or smart phones, Plaintiffs have not chosen to frame their complaint in \n22 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 31 Filed: 08/18/17 Page 23 of 24 PageID #:188\nhave not alleged a First Amendment violation, their reliance on First Amendment case law is \nmisplaced.  In those cases, the vagueness claims were not subject to the heavy burden facial to \nwhich attacks arising outside of the First Amendment context are subject.  See Hill v. Colorado, \n530 U.S. 703, 732 (2000); see also Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 109 (1972).  Even \nin Doe v. Cooper, cited to by Plaintiffs, a case in which registered sex offenders brought a § \n1983 action based on a statute prohibiting the offenders from associating in the presence of \nminors, the sex offenders specifically had First Amendment claims.  842 F.3d 833 (4th Cir. \n2016).  The Complaint does not currently allege any violations of their First Amendment rights. \n  The question then is whether there is “no set of circumstances [] under which the Act \nwould  be  valid.”    United  States  v.  Salerno,  481  U.S.  739,  745  (1987).    But  there  are \ncircumstances when the legislature relies on the word “near” and the statutes are valid.  See Cox \nv. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 559, 568-69 (1965).  To allow the facial attack to proceed here would be \nto  find  that  any  legislation  incorporating  the  term  “near”  without  a  definition  is  per  se \nunconstitutional  on  vagueness  grounds.    The  Court  declines  to  make  such  a  finding.  \nNevertheless, the term “near” in the statute compounds the broad discretion IDOC officials have \nbeen granted in determining whether to release Plaintiffs on MSR.  Plaintiffs sufficiently allege \nthat these rules, taken together and applied to Plaintiffs violate their constitutional rights.  But \n                                                                                                                                                             \nterms of a violation of the first amendment.  Such an allegation has been found to be a valid claim in Packingham v. \nNorth Carolina, by the Supreme Court.  137 S. Ct. 1730 (2017).  In this recent decision, the court acknowledged that \nthere is no doubt that sexual abuse of a child is a “most serious crime” and it is clear a legislature “may pass valid \nlaws to protect children[,]” but broadly worded statutes prohibiting sex offenders from accessing, for example, \nsocial media like the challenged North Carolina statute in Packingham infringe on the First Amendment.  The court \nexplained the ever-expanding importance of the internet and speech: “[w]hile we now may be coming to the \nrealization that the Cyber Age is a revolution of historic proportions, we cannot appreciate yet its full dimensions \nand vast potential to alter how we think, express ourselves, and define who want to be. … In sum, to foreclose \naccess to social media altogether is to prevent the user from engaging in the legitimate exercise of First Amendment \nrights.  It is unsettling to suggest that only a limited set of websites can be used even by persons who have \ncompleted their sentences. Even convicted criminals—and in some instances especially convicted criminals—might \nreceive legitimate benefits from these means for access to the world of ideas, in particular if they seek to reform and \nto pursue lawful and rewarding lives. ”   \n23 \n \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 31 Filed: 08/18/17 Page 24 of 24 PageID #:189\nwithout any alleged First Amendment violations, a finding that this provision alone is void for \nvagueness is not proper and therefore the claim is dismissed for failure to state a claim. \nCONCLUSION \n  For those reasons, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is granted with respect to Plaintiffs \nAukema and Tucek’s claims.  The Motion is also granted with respect to the void for vagueness \ndue process claim.  The Motion is denied with respect to the remaining counts.   \n \n            __________________________________ \nVirginia M.

Plaintiffs Paul Murphy, Stanley Meyer, J.D. \nLindenmeyer, and Jasen Gustafsen are putative class representatives who sued Defendants Lisa \nMadigan and John Baldwin, in their official capacities, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief \nfor alleged Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment civil rights violations under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  \n(Dkt. No. [1].)  Each named Plaintiff has completed a criminal sentence for sex-related crimes \nand the Illinois Prison Review Board (“PRB”) granted each of them release from incarceration \nalong with mandatory supervised release (“MSR”) ranging from three-years to life.  (Id. at 3.)  \nInstead, however, each Plaintiff is still incarcerated and they allege this is a result of “unmeetable \nrestrictions on where [the Plaintiffs] can live that must be satisfied in order for such individuals \nto be released on MSR.”  (Id. at 2.)  In their Class Complaint the Plaintiffs identify two proposed \nclasses:  \n \n(1) All individuals who have received an MSR sentence of three years to life currently detained \nin the Illinois Department of Corrections who have been approved for release on MSR by the \nPRB but have been denied release from IDOC custody because of their inability to find an \napproved host site; and \n \n(2) All individuals who have received an MSR sentence of three years to life currently or in the \nfuture detained in the Illinois Department of Corrections who will in the future remain detained \nindefinitely in prison due to the unavailability of host sites. \n \n(Id. at 24.)  Subsequently, the Court dismissed as premature the claims on behalf of plaintiff-\ninmates who alleged future civil rights violations for post-release MSR conditions where their \nsentences had not yet run.  (Dkt. No. 31, at 7-10.)  As a result, when the Plaintiffs filed their \nMotion for Class Certification and Appointment of Class Counsel they sought only to certify a \n \n\n \nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 63 Filed: 04/06/18 Page 2 of 2 PageID #:328\nclass of “all individuals sentenced to serve ‘three-years-to-life’ on MSR currently detained in the \nIllinois Department of Corrections (“IDOC”) who have been approved for release on MSR by \nthe PRB but have been denied release from IDOC custody because of their inability to obtain an \napproved host site.”  (Dkt. No. 41, at 1.)   Therefore, the motion to certify the class and the \nappointment of class counsel [41] are both granted as defined.   \n \n \n \n               \nDate:  4/6/2018          /s/Virginia M.

ECF No. 132. \nSince the entry of this Order, the parties have engaged in good faith negotiations \nseeking to identify solutions to constitutional problems identified in the Court's \nOrder. Counsel for the Attorney General and the Department of Corrections have \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 156 Filed: 01/15/20 Page 2 of 4 PageID #:1622\nput forth a variety of proposals to reduce the population of class members being \ndetained due to an inability to secure a host site, including changes to IDOC policy \nto make it more feasible for individuals to identify compliant host sites; partnering \nwith community providers to provide transitional housing placements; allowing \neligible class members to participate in work release; and exploring the potential for \nplacement of eligible class members at mental health treatment facilities operated \nby the state's Department of Human Services. \nBut despite the parties' good faith efforts, more than 290 class members remain \nimprisoned beyond the completion of their prison terms due to an inability to satisfy \nthe host-site requirement. The class is continuing to grow larger as additional \nindividuals complete their prison sentences and become eligible for mandatory \nsupervised release and are unable to secure an approved host site. \nIn light of the above, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED: \n1.  Plan: By February 27, 2020, Defendants will submit a plan setting forth the \nspecific steps they will take to ensure that by no later than January 2, 2021, no \nmember of the class will remain imprisoned due to an inability to comply with the \nhost-site requirement. The Court will not dictate precisely what course Defendants \nshould follow, but leaves it to the discretion of the State to identify what \nalternatives, including but not limited to legislative changes, policy changes, and/or \ncontracting with transitional housing providers, will most easily and economically \nfulfill the State's constitutional obligations. Plaintiffs shall have an opportunity to \n2 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 156 Filed: 01/15/20 Page 3 of 4 PageID #:1622\nrespond to Defendants' proposed plan within 30 days. The Court will enter a final \norder setting forth a plan after considering the parties' written submissions. \n2.  Periodic Reports and Status Hearings: Following the Court's entry of a \nfinal order setting forth a plan, Defendants shall prepare and submit to the Court \nperiodic reports every 90 days setting forth the steps taken to implement the plan; \nthe number of class members who remain imprisoned due to the lack of a host site; \nany additional or alternative measures that Defendants may have adopted to meet \nthe January 2, 2021, deadline; and any anticipated difficulties in complying with \nthe January 2, 2021, deadline. The first report shall be due March 30, 2020. In \naddition, the parties shall appear for a status conference every 90 days to report on \nthese matters. The first status conference shall be held April 6, 2020 at 9:00 a.m. \n3.  Enforcement Mechanism: Should Defendants fail to meet the January 2, \n2021, deadline for compliance with this Order, the Plaintiffs can file an appropriate \npleading bringing the nature ofiDOC's non-compliance with this Order to the \nCourt's attention. The Court will hold a hearing to determine an appropriate \nresponse, including but not limited to imposition of monetary sanctions. However, \nDefendants shall not be considered to be in violation of this Order under the \nfollowing circumstances: \nThe class member is held beyond his or her release date because he or she has \nexpressed a preference for remaining in prison rather than being released into \nhomelessness;or \n3 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 156 Filed: 01/15/20 Page 4 of 4 PageID #:1622\n•  A class member is detained for 30 days or less beyond his or her release date \nwhile Defendants seek a placement  the class member. \n/_-~;£0 \nDate \n4 ",
