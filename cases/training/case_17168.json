    "summary": "<p>On November 13, 2015, ten residents of Flint, Michigan filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The plaintiffs sued Governor Rick Snyder, the State of Michigan, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ), several MDEQ officials, the Emergency Managers of Flint, the Mayor of Flint, the Director of Public Works for Flint, the Utilities Administrators of Flint, and the City of Flint under U.S.C. &sect; 1983 and state law. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, alleged that their Due Process rights were violated when the defendants took safe drinking water from Flint and replaced it with water known to contain high levels of lead and other corrosive contaminants. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that by replacing the safe water with corrosive water the defendants harmed their property, caused physical and emotional injury, and violated their right to bodily integrity. The plaintiffs sought an order certifying the class as all &ldquo;individuals who from April 25, 2014 to present were exposed to toxic Flint water and experience an injury to their person or property or who in the future will be so injured.&rdquo; Furthermore, the plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment, compensatory and punitive damages, attorneys&rsquo; fees and cost, and injunctive relief to remedy harm to property, establish a medical monitoring fund, and appoint a monitor to oversee Flint&rsquo;s water operation. Additionally, the plaintiffs demanded a jury trial.</p>\r\n<p>From 1964 until 2014, the City of Flint provided safe, clean water to residents via the Detroit water system. According to the complaint, although Flint and MDEQ officials were aware that the water of the Flint River was highly corrosive and dangerous, in April 2014, the Emergency Manager ordered the city to switch its water source to the Flint River. Despite continued protests from Flint residents, defendants insisted the water was safe and declined to switch back to the Detroit water system. It was not until October 8, 2015 that Governor Snyder ordered Flint to switch back to the Detroit water system. However, the plaintiffs alleged that due to the prolonged exposure to contaminated water they suffer from property damage and serious physical and emotional injuries, such as high levels of lead and copper in their bloodstreams, skin lesions, hair loss, and neurological and psychological disorders.</p>\r\n<p>On April 1, 2016, the plaintiffs filed a motion to consolidate six class action cases pending before the Court and designate a process for selecting interim lead counsel. The six class actions were all brought on behalf of Flint residents, consumers or businesses and based on the City of Flint switching its water source to the highly corrosive and dangerous water of the Flint River.</p>\r\n<p>Shortly after, on April 4, 2016, Governor Snyder and the State of Michigan filed a motion to dismiss. Additional defendants-the Emergency Managers of Flint, the Director of Public Works, the City of Flint, the Utilities Administrators of Flint, and the Mayor of Flint-filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs&rsquo; complaint on April 18, 2016. Both the motions argued that the officials were entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity, the Safe Drinking Water Act precluded action under &sect; 1983 for alleged deprivations of constitutional rights related to water quality standards, and the complaint fails to state a claim for a violation of substantive due process. Instead, the defendants argued that this claim must be brought under the Safe Drinking Water Act.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on May 25, 2016, adding allegations that their Equal Protection rights were violated on the basis of race and wealth when the defendants elected to provide clean water to the remainder of Genesee County but not Flint. In addition, the plaintiffs added claims of conspiracy to violate the plaintiffs&rsquo; constitutional rights under U.S.C. &sect; 1985(3), allegations of state law violations, and several defendants, including the Treasurer for the State of Michigan, the Director of Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHSS), and the Genesee County Drain Commissioner. Finally, the plaintiffs anticipated that additional negligence claims would be added against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on October 25, 2016 or after.</p>\r\n<p>Following the amended complaint, multiple defendants again filed a motion to dismiss. Governor Snyder, the State of Michigan, the Treasurer and the Director of MDHSS filed a motion to dismiss on June 27, 2016 again arguing that the claims were barred by Eleventh Amendment immunity, the Safe Drinking Water Act precluded the plaintiffs &sect; 1983 claims, and the amended complaint fails to state a claim for violation for substantive due process. They additionally argued that the plaintiffs&rsquo; other claims fail because there was no showing of discriminatory intent or involvement of a fundamental right. Additional motions to dismiss were filed by the Emergency Managers, City Officials of the City of Flint, the MDEQ officials, and the Genesee County Drain Commissioner on July 29, 2016 and August 1, 2016. Although the groups of defendants filed separately, the motions all argued similar reasons for dismissing the plaintiffs&rsquo; lawsuit.</p>\r\n<p>Due to the overwhelming local media coverage and publicity of the Flint water crisis, the MDEQ officials filed a motion for change of venue and requested that the case be transfer to an out-of-state venue or to the Norther Division of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan. The MDEQ officials simultaneously requested the Court stay all proceedings, such as the motions to dismiss, until the Court decided their motion for change of venue.</p>\r\n<p>On February 2, 2017, Judge John Corbett O&rsquo;Meara granted the defendants&rsquo; motions to dismiss. 2017 WL 445637. Relying on its decision in <em>Boler v. Earley</em> (Case No. 16-10323), Judge O&rsquo;Meara agreed with the defendants that the Safe Drinking Water Act and its enforcement scheme precluded the plaintiffs from bring suit under &sect; 1983. Judge O&rsquo;Meara concluded that without viable constitutional claims, the plaintiffs&rsquo; conspiracy claims under &sect; 1985(3) also fails. In addition, Judge O&rsquo;Meara declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the plaintiffs&rsquo; state claims.</p>\r\n<p>Later in February 2017, the plaintiffs appealed the dismissal of their complaint to the Sixth Circuit. The Court of Appeals consolidated the appeal with an appeal to <em>Boler v. Earley</em> (Case No. 16-10323). On July 28, 2017, the Court of Appeals reversed Judge O&rsquo;Meara&rsquo;s decision to dismiss the claims because there was no express indication in the Safe Drinking Water Act Congress intended to preempt &sect; 1983 claims, the remedies of the Act were not so comprehensive as to demonstrate congressional intent to preclude claims under &sect; 1983, and the rights and protections of the Act diverge from the constitutional claims so as to prevent an inference of congressional intent. (Circuit Judges R. Guy Cole Jr., Jane Branstetter Stranch, and Bernice B. Donald). 865 F.3d 391. The Court of Appeals dismissed the claims against the State of Michigan because the claims were barred by Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity.

This class action is pursued on behalf of tens of thousands of residents \n(โClassโ) of the City of Flint (โFlintโ), who from April 25, 2014 to the present, have \nexperienced and will continue to experience serious personal injury and property \ndamage caused by Defendantsโ deliberate decision to expose them to the extreme \ntoxicity of water pumped from the Flint River into their homes, schools, hospitals, \nworkplaces and public places. \n2.  Defendants, who are all state of Michigan (โStateโ) or Flint government \nemployees, acting under the color of law, deliberately deprived Plaintiffs and the \nPlaintiff Class of the rights and guarantees secured by the 14th Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution in that they deprived Plaintiffs of life, liberty and property \nwithout due process of law when they took from Plaintiffs safe drinking water and \nreplaced it with what they knew to be a highly toxic alternative solely for fiscal \npurposes. \n3.  โFor more than 18 months, state and local government officials ignored \nirrefutable  evidence  that  the  water  pumped  from  the  Flint  River  exposed  the \n2 \n \n\n2:15-cv-14002-JCO-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 11/13/15   Pg 3 of 30    Pg ID 3\nPlaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class to extreme toxicity, causing serious and dire injury \nand health hazards, and property damage to the Flint water users. These state and \nlocal officials, Defendants herein, regularly assured the Flint water users that the \nwater supplied from the Flint River was being properly treated,  monitored and tested \nand was safe to consume and use.  Information obtained through the Freedom of \nInformation Act establishes that many of these assurances were known to be false \nwhen uttered:  state and local officials were not properly monitoring or sampling the \nFlint River water and delayed in notifying the public of serious safety and health \nrisks in a knowing and deliberate effort to conceal the truth from those who were \nbeing poisoned.  The deliberately false denials about the safety of the Flint River \nwater was as deadly as it was arrogant.โ \n4.   The massive personal and property injuries experienced by Plaintiffs \nand  the  Class,  and  the  ensuing  environmental  disaster,  reaches  constitutional \nproportions because defendants, acting under the color of law, both created and \nincreased the risk of prolonged serious and life threatening dangers to Plaintiffs and \nthe Class where none existed before. \n5.    The state and local government officials, Defendants herein, who \nmade the decision to replace safe water with an alternative that created toxic water, \nviolated the constitutional rights of Plaintiffs and Plaintiff Class members by acting \n3 \n \n\n2:15-cv-14002-JCO-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 11/13/15   Pg 4 of 30    Pg ID 4\nin a manner that shocks the conscience and was deliberately indifferent to the those \nconstitutional rights, as well as to the health and well-being of the Plaintiffs.    \n      JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n6.  This is a civil action brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 seeking \ninjunctive  and  declaratory  relief  together  with  monetary  damages  against \nDefendants  for  violation  of  Fourteenth  Amendment  of  the  United  States \nConstitution. \n7.  This  Court  has  jurisdiction  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  ยง  1331,  which \nauthorizes federal courts to decide cases concerning federal questions; 28 U.S.C. ยง \n1343(a)(3) and (4), which authorizes federal courts to hear civil rights cases; and 28 \nU.S.C. ยง 2201, the Declaratory Judgment Act.  This Court has personal jurisdiction \nover Defendants named herein as public officials of the State of Michigan sued in \ntheir individual capacities and public officials, employees of the City of Flint sued \nin their official and individual capacities and the City of Flint for violations of \nplaintiffsโ  constitutional  rights.  Similarly,  the  Court  has  jurisdiction  over  the \nGovernor of the State of Michigan, in his official capacity, for prospective relief, \nexclusively.  \n8.  Venue is proper in this Court as Defendants conduct their business in \nthe Eastern District of Michigan.  \nPARTIES \nA.  PLAINTIFFS \n4 \n \n\n2:15-cv-14002-JCO-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 11/13/15   Pg 5 of 30    Pg ID 5\n9.

Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and a Class \nof individuals who were injured in their persons or their property after April 25, 2014 \nbecause of their exposure to the toxic water pumped from the Flint Rivers. \nB.

Melissa and Michael Mays were the equitable owners of the home \nlocated on Beecher Street. \n30.  From April 18, 2014 until approximately September, 2014, members of \nthe Mays family, unaware of the toxic nature of the tap water supplied by Flint,   \n10 \n \n\n2:15-cv-14002-JCO-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 11/13/15   Pg 11 of 30    Pg ID 11\nregularly  used  the  water  for  drinking,  cooking,  washing,  bathing  and  clothes \nwashing.  \n31.  In September, 2014 the Mays family, in response to an advisory to boil \nall drinking water coming from their taps, discontinued drinking or cooking with the \nwater supplied by Flint.  The family was led to believe that the water would still be \nsafe for washing, bathing and clothes washing. The family continued to wash, bathe \nand wash clothing with the water until the summer of 2015 when the family became \naware ofthe highly toxic and deleterious nature of the supplied water. \n32.  As  a  proximate  result  of  Defendants  actions,  as  set  forth  herein, \nmembers of the Mays family have experienced serious physical and emotional injury \ndue to their exposure to the toxic water, including but not limited to: \na.  High levels of lead and copper in their bloodstreams, brains, bones \nand other organs; \n \nb.  Skin lesions and hair loss; \nc.  Chemical induced hypertension; \nd.  Autoimmune disorder; \ne.  Neurological  disorders  such  as  โbrain  fogโ,  seizure  like \nconvulsions, vision loss, memory loss; \n \nf.  Psychological disorders such as depression, chronic anxiety, post-\ntraumatic stress disorder and an inability to cope with normal stress. \n \n33.  Melissa and Michael Mays have experienced property damage in the \nnature of irreparably damaged service line pipes resulting from Flintโs use of Flint \n11 \n \n\n2:15-cv-14002-JCO-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 11/13/15   Pg 12 of 30    Pg ID 12\nwater without use of an anti-corrosive agent; as well, they have sustained substantial \nloss in the value of their property. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS REGARDING THE PEMBERTON FAMILY \n34.  Keith John Pemberton and Jacqueline Pemberton are 67 and 66 years \nold and live on Custer Street in Flint. \n35.  The Pembertons own the home on Custer Street.  \n36.  As a proximate result of Defendants actions, as set forth herein, the \nPembertons have experienced property damage in the nature of irreparably damaged \nservice line pipes resulting from Flintโs use of Flint water without use of an anti-\ncorrosive agent, as well as the substantial loss in the value of their property. They \nhave experienced serious physical and emotional injury due to their exposure to the \ntoxic water, including but not limited to: \na.  High levels of lead and copper in their bloodstreams, brains, bones \nand other organs; \n \nb.  Skin lesions and hair loss; \nc.  Neurological  disorders  such  as  โbrain  fogโ,  seizure  like \nconvulsions, vision loss, memory loss; \n \nd.  Chronic and acute abdominal and stomach discomfort; \ne.

Elnora Carthan is a 70 year old widow who lives alone at, a home she \nowns in Flint and where she has lived since 1976.  \n38.  In April, 2014, after the actions of these Defendants caused her water \nto become highly toxic, when it had once been safe and nourishing, Ms. Carthan \nbegan to boil her water but also continued to cook with it and to wash and bathe with \nit.  \n39.  Finally, in August, 2015, the opportunity arose for her to have her water \ntested for the presence of lead and other metals. This opportunity arose due to the \nefforts of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (โVirginia Techโ), \nnotwithstanding the continuous denials and roadblocks to such testing posed by \nthese Defendants. As a result, she determined that the lead levels in her water vastly \nexceeded anything close to acceptable and were, in fact, extremely dangerous. \n40.  As a proximate result of Defendants actions, as set forth herein, Ms. \nCarthan has suffered property damage as well as a loss in the value of her property. \n41.  As a proximate result of Defendants actions, as set forth herein, Ms. \nCarthan has experienced serious physical and emotional injury due to her exposure \nto the toxic water, including but not limited to: \na.  Skin lesions and dermatologic pathology; \nb.  Neurological  disorders,  including  but  not  limited  to  constant \nexhaustion and memory loss; \n \nc.  Chronic and acute respiratory disorders including, but not limited \nto, chronic rhinitis; \n13 \n \n\n2:15-cv-14002-JCO-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 11/13/15   Pg 14 of 30    Pg ID 14\n \nd.  Psychological disorders such as depression, chronic anxiety, post-\ntraumatic stress disorder and an inability to cope with normal stress. \n \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS REGARDING THE KELSO FAMILY \n42.  Rhonda  Kelso  is  a  52  year  old  woman  who  suffers  from  several \ndisabilities,  including  the  results  of  a  stroke,  spastic  paraparesis  and  bi-polar \ndisorder. She owns her home located in Flint. She and her family have lived in that \nhome since 1993. \n43.  As a result of the toxicity in the water, these Defendants have caused \nmassive damage to the water pipes in the Keslo home, causing extreme disruption, \ninconvenience, discomfort and emotional distress. \n44.  Ms. Kelso lives at the aforementioned home with her minor daughter \nโK.E.K.โ who is 12 years old.

From 1964 to 2014, Flint water users received their water from Lake \nHuron via the Detroit water system. \n50.  During this 50 year span, the Flint water users enjoyed safe, clean, fresh \nwater in their homes, businesses, hospitals other places of public services. \n51.  In 2011, Flint government officials commissioned a study to determine \nif the Flint River could be safely used by the city as the primary source of drinking \nwater for its more than 31,000 users. \n52.  According to recent media reports, the report stated that the water from \nthe Flint River was highly corrosive and could not be used safely without an anti-\ncorrosive agent to prevent lead, copper and other heavy metals from leaching from \nlead, copper and iron based water lines. \n53.  According to recent media reports, in 2013, Flint government officials \ndelivered to MDEQ the report that stated and warned that the Flint River water was \nhighly corrosive and could not be used as a primary source of drinking water unless \ntreated with anti-corrosive agents. \n54.  In March, 2013, the Flint City Council approved a resolution to secure \nfuture water service from a regional water authority known as the Karegnondi Water \nAuthority (โKWAโ) scheduled to become operational in 2016. \n55.  In April 2014, although safe water from Detroit remained available on \na  temporary  basis  until  the  KWA  became  operational  two  years  later,  Flint \nEmergency Manager at the time Defendant Earley ordered Flint to draw water from \n16 \n \n\n2:15-cv-14002-JCO-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 11/13/15   Pg 17 of 30    Pg ID 17\nthe Flint River, even though he knew that the water was highly corrosive and \ndangerous to people and property when distributed without proper anti-corrosive \ntreatment.  \n56.  According to recent media reports, defendants had been informed by \nthe 2011 report that use of the Flint River water, without a proper anti-corrosive \ntreatment, would create a condition dangerous to health and property. \n57.  Beginning in April 2014, Defendants were fully aware that the required \nand necessary anti-corrosive was not being used in during the distribution of Flint \nRiver water to Flint residents, families and home owners. \n58.  It has been estimated that the daily cost of the anti-corrosive agent \nwould have been $60.  \n59.  Flint water users, having enjoyed decades of safe, clean and fresh water \nvia the Detroit water system, knew almost immediately after the switch to Flint River \nwater that something was not right about this new water supply. \n60.   Within days after the switch, Defendants began receiving complaints \nfrom water users that the water was cloudy and foul in appearance, taste and odor.  \n61.  During the next 8 months, Flint water users expressed their concerns \nabout water quality in a multiple of ways including letters, emails and telephone calls \nto Flint and MDEQ officials, the media and through well publicized demonstrations \non the streets of Flint. \n17 \n \n\n2:15-cv-14002-JCO-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 11/13/15   Pg 18 of 30    Pg ID 18\n62.  After  8  months  of  undertaking  this  failed  โexperiment,โ  the  only \nreasonable response to the mounting complaints would have been to reconnect the \nFlint water system to the Detroit water system.  Instead, Defendants ignored the \nprotests,  went  into  deliberate  denial  mode,  offered  ineffective  solutions  and \ncontinued to falsely reassure and insist that the water was safe even though they \nknew that the foul taste, odor and appearance probably was the result of using highly \ncorrosive Flint River water, untreated with the proper anti-corrosive agents, which \ncaused particulate lead to contaminate the water. \n63.  Beginning almost immediately after the Flint River became the primary \nsource of water for the Flint users, the MDEQ and Flint officials were aware of \nelevated levels of Trihalomethanes (โTTHMโ) in the water and that these levels were \nabove the legal limit. \n64.  After  about  7  months  of  elevated  TTHM  levels,  Flint  water  users \nreceived a notice in January, 2015 from Flint stating that the water was not in \ncompliance with the federal Safe Drinking Water Act because unlawful levels of \nTTHMs. \n65.  Within a few weeks of the issuance of the TTHM notice, Flint City \nCouncil members approached Emergency Manager Defendant Earley demanding \nthat a reasonable response to the health risks would be that Flint should reconnect \nwith Detroit water. Earley refused to act as requested by members of the City \nCouncil. \n18 \n \n\n2:15-cv-14002-JCO-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 11/13/15   Pg 19 of 30    Pg ID 19\n66.  At this same time, representatives of the Detroit water system expressed \ninterest in re-establishing a relationship with Flint and offered to waive the $4 \nmillion re-connect fee in order re-establish the relationship.   Defendant  Earley \nrejected  this  initiative,  and  deliberately  continued  to  mislead  Flint  residents  to \nbelieve that their water was safe. \n67.  On  January  20,  2015,  citizen  protests  mounted,  fueled  in  part  by \nencouragement from environmental activist Erin  Brockovich and her associate, \nwater expert Bob Bowcock.  These advocates offered advice and assistance to the \nprotesting Flint water users who were now very concerned about the health risks \nthey faced by this toxic water.  \n68.  On January 13, 2015, Earley left his position as Emergency Manager \nand was replaced by Emergency Manager Ambrose. On January 29, 2015, Detroit \nDirector of Water offered to Emergency Manager Ambrose another opportunity to \nprotect Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class from known dangers and to use Detroit \nwater.  Notwithstanding Detroitโs overture, Emergency Manager Ambrose rejected \nthis offer, and deliberately continued to mislead Flint residents to believe that their \nwater was safe. \n69.  On February 17, 2015, Flint water users staged public demonstrations \ndemanding that Flint re-connect with Detroit.  Once again Ambrose refused to \nrestore Detroit water for Flint water users and deliberately continued to endanger \nPlaintiffs and Plaintiff Class. \n19 \n \n\n2:15-cv-14002-JCO-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 11/13/15   Pg 20 of 30    Pg ID 20\n70.  In the meantime, and according to emails received via the Freedom of \nInformation Act, the MDEQ (including named Defendants from that agency) knew \nthat Flint residents were being exposed to particulate lead on a daily basis. Moreover, \nMDEQ  representatives,  including  named  Defendants,  knew  that  inaccurate  test \nresults were providing false assurance to residents about the true lead levels in the \nwater. \n71.  On March 25, 2015, Flint City Council voted to re-connect to Detroitโs \nwater system.  Ambrose rejected this vote and continued to refuse to re-connect the \nFlint system back to the Detroit water system.  \n72.  In June of 2015, EPA representative Miquel Del Toral wrote a detailed \nmemo outlining numerous dangerous problems with the water being pumped from \nthe Flint River including unacceptable levels of lead. This report was shared with \nMDEQ defendants Shekter-Smith, Cook, Busch and Prysby. \n73.  During  the  spring  and  summer  of  2015,  Professor  Marc  Edwards \n(โProfessor Edwardsโ) and other experts from Virginia Tech tested 277 drinking \nwater samples and found that 10% of the samples had lead levels of 25 parts per \nbillion (ppb), substantially in excess of the federal action level of 15 ppb.  \n74.  Professor Edwards also determined that the Flint River water was 19 \ntimes more corrosive than the water pumped from Lake Huron by the Detroit water \nsystem. \n20 \n \n\n2:15-cv-14002-JCO-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 11/13/15   Pg 21 of 30    Pg ID 21\n75.  When Professor Edwards published the results of his studies, demands \nfor  the  re-connecting  to  the  Detroit  water  system  started  to  be  made  to  the \nDefendants. These demands came from national and regional public interest groups \nsuch as the ACLU of Michigan, the Natural Resources Defense Council and local \npublic interest groups such as the Michigan Chapter of the National Conference \nBlack Lawyers, NAACP-Michigan State Conference, Michigan Nurses Association, \nDemocracy Defense League Water Task Force, Water You Fighting For, Concerned \nPastors for Social Action, Coalition for Clean Water and other similar public interest \ngroups. \n76.  At this time, public interest groups investigating the growing crisis \nnoted that Flint did not have records of which user had or did not have lead service \npipes or plumbing.  Flint was required by Federal law to maintain these records so \nthat Flint and the MDEQ could alter those users who were most at risk and that \nproper testing could be carried out. The absence of these required records was \nincreasing the risk of harm to many Flint water users. \n77.  In  addition,  Dr.  Mona  Hanna-Attisha  MD  of  Hurley  Hospital \ndemonstrated a dramatic and dangerous spike in elevated blood lead levels in a large \ncohort of Flint children corresponding with the time of exposure to the highly \ncorrosive Flint River water. Her disturbing results were published in August of 2015. \n78.  Faced with overwhelming evidence that the water was unsafe to drink \nand a source of lead poisoning for the children of Flint and other vulnerable persons, \n21 \n \n\n2:15-cv-14002-JCO-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 11/13/15   Pg 22 of 30    Pg ID 22\nGenesee  County  Health  Officials,  on  October  1,  2015,  issued  a  public  health \nemergency advising Flint residents not to drink the tap water. \n79.  Although  reconnecting  to  the  Detroit  water  system  was  the  only \nreasonable option to protect the health and safety of the Flint water users, and this \noption should have been exercised within weeks of the appearance of the foul water, \nDefendants deliberately chose not to  do so. Instead, on October 2, 2015, state \nofficials announced that the State would provide water filters to Flint water users in \na useless effort to ameliorate the problem.  \n80.  On October 8, 2015, Defendant Snyder recognized that he could no \nlonger pretend that the water from the Flint River was safe. He finally ordered Flint \nto re-connect with the Detroit water system. \n81.  However,  based  on  information  and  belief,  due  to  the  prolonged \nexposure of contaminated water without adequate anti-corrosive agents, Plaintiffs \nand Plaintiff Class members continue to be exposed to toxic water until such time \nthat pipes and services lines that were damaged by corrosive water from the Flint \nRiver can be replaced. \n                                     CLASS ALLEGATIONS \n82.  This action is brought by the named Plaintiffs on behalf of individuals \nwho from April 25, 2014 to present were exposed to toxic Flint water and experienced \nan injury to their person or property or who in the future will be so injured. \n22 \n \n\n2:15-cv-14002-JCO-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 11/13/15   Pg 23 of 30    Pg ID 23\n83.  The number of injured individuals who have been injured by exposure \nto toxic Flint water is in the tens of thousands.  The number of class members is \nsufficiently numerous to make class action status the most practical method for \nPlaintiffs to secure redress for injuries sustained and class wide equitable relief.   \n84.  There are questions of law and fact raised by the named Plaintiffsโ \nclaims common to, and typical of, those raised by the Class they seek to represent.   \n85.  The  violations  of  law  and  resulting  harms  alleged  by  the  named \nPlaintiffs are typical of the legal violations and harms suffered by all Class members. \n86.  Plaintiff Class representatives will fairly and adequately protect the \ninterests of the Plaintiff class members.  Plaintiffsโ counsel are unaware of any  \nconflicts of interest between the class representatives and absent class members with \nrespect  to  the  matters  at  issue  in  this  litigation;  the  class  representatives  will \nvigorously prosecute the suit on behalf of the Class; and the class representatives are \nrepresented by experienced counsel.  Plaintiffs are represented by attorneys with \nsubstantial experience and expertise in complex and class action litigation involving \npersonal and property damage. \n87.   Plaintiffsโ attorneys have identified and thoroughly investigated all \nclaims in this action, and have committed sufficient resources to represent the Class. \n88.  The maintenance of the action as a class action will be superior to other \navailable methods of adjudication and will promote the convenient administration of \njustice.  Moreover, the prosecution of separate actions by individual members of the \n23 \n \n\n2:15-cv-14002-JCO-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 11/13/15   Pg 24 of 30    Pg ID 24\nClass could result in inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual \nmembers of the Class and/or one or more of the Defendants.  \n89.  Defendants have acted or failed to act on grounds generally applicable \nto all Plaintiffs, necessitating declaratory and injunctive relief for the Class.   \nCOUNT I-CAUSE OF ACTION:  VIOLATION OF 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \nSUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS โ STATE CREATED DANGER \nPLAINTIFFS V ALL DEFENDANTS \n \n90.  The due process clause of the 14th Amendment provides that the state \nmay not deprive a person of life, liberty or property without due process of law. \n91.  These  Defendants  deliberately  withdrew  water  that  was  safe  for \ndrinking, cooking, washing and bathing from Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class. They \ndeliberately  exposed  Plaintiffs  and  the  Plaintiff  Class  to  dangerous,  unsafe  and \nuntreated (or inadequately treated) Flint River water knowing that it could and would \nresult in widespread permanent serious damage caused by the toxic water including \nthe irreversible lead poisoning of children and other vulnerable persons.  This conduct \nwas culpable in the extreme. \n92.  Plaintiffs and Class Members were foreseeable victims of the decision \nto replace safe water with a toxic alternative. \n93.  The decisions and actions to deprive Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class \nof clean and healthy water and to replace that water with toxic, unhealthy and unsafe \nwater constituted affirmative acts that caused and/or increased the risk of harm, both \n24 \n \n\n2:15-cv-14002-JCO-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 11/13/15   Pg 25 of 30    Pg ID 25\nproperty damage, as well as physical and emotional injury, to Plaintiffs and Plaintiff \nClass. \n94.   At all times herein Defendants acted under color of law. \n95.  The  unconstitutional  acts  of  Earley  and  Ambrose  as  Emergency \nManagers executes a policy statement or decision officially adopted by the City of \nFlint. \n96.  As  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of  the  unconstitutional  acts  of \nDefendants as alleged in this complaint, Plaintiffs and Plaintiff Class members have \nexperienced serious and in some cases life threatening and irreversible bodily injury; \nPlaintiffs and Plaintiff Class members have and will incur substantial economic \nlosses in the nature of medical expenses, lost wages; Plaintiffs and Plaintiff Class \nmembers are entitled to an award of non-economic damages in the nature of pain and \nsuffering, embarrassment, outrage, mental anguish, fear and mortification, and stress \nrelated  physical  symptoms  such  as  sleepiness,  gastro-intestinal  discomfort, \nneuropathy and similar symptoms. \n97.  Plaintiffs  and  Plaintiff  Class  members  have  experienced  property \ndamage to the homes and places of business in the nature of lost property value and \nseek damages to remediate the permanent damage caused by the use of corrosive \nwater without proper anti-corrosive treatment. \n98.  The  conduct  of  Defendants  was  reckless  and  outrageous,  entitling \nPlaintiffs and Plaintiff Class members to an award of punitive damages. \n25 \n \n\n2:15-cv-14002-JCO-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 11/13/15   Pg 26 of 30    Pg ID 26\nCOUNT II -CAUSE OF ACTION:  VIOLATION OF 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \nSUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS โ BODILY INTEGRITY \nPLAINTIFFS v ALL DEFENDANTS \n \n99.  The due process clause of the 14th Amendment includes an implied right \nto bodily integrity. \n100.  Defendants violated Plaintiffsโ and Plaintiff Class membersโ right to \nbodily integrity, insofar as: \na.  Defendants a duty to protect Plaintiffs and Plaintiff Class members \nfrom a foreseeable risk of harm from contaminated water;  \nb.  Defendants  knew  of  the  serious  medical  risks  associated  with \nexposure to contaminated water; \nc.  Defendants failed to protect Plaintiffs and Plaintiff Class members \nfrom the known risks associated with exposure to contaminated \nwater; and \nd.  Plaintiffs and Plaintiff Class members suffered bodily harm as a \nresult of their exposure to contaminated water. \n101.  Defendantsโ conduct in exposing Flint residents to toxic water was so \negregious and so outrageous that it shocks the conscience. Defendants had time for \ndeliberation in their decisions to expose Flint residents to toxic water, and their \ndecision to do so was made with deliberate indifference to the serious medical risks. \n102.  As  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of  the  unconstitutional  acts  of \nDefendants as alleged in this complaint, Plaintiffs and Plaintiff Class members have \n26 \n \n\n2:15-cv-14002-JCO-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 11/13/15   Pg 27 of 30    Pg ID 27\nexperienced serious and in some cases life threatening and irreversible bodily injury; \nPlaintiffs and Plaintiff Class members have and will incur substantial economic \nlosses in the nature of medical expenses, lost wages; Plaintiffs and Plaintiff Class \nmembers are entitled to an award of non-economic damages in the nature of pain and \nsuffering, embarrassment, outrage, mental anguish, fear and mortification, and stress \nrelated  physical  symptoms  such  as  sleepiness,  gastro-intestinal  discomfort, \nneuropathy and similar symptoms. \n103.  The  conduct  of  Defendants  was  reckless  and  outrageous,  entitling \nPlaintiffs and Plaintiff Class members to an award of punitive damages. \n                                         RELIEF REQUESTED \nAccordingly, plaintiffs request the following relief from the court: \na.  An order certifying this case as a Class Action; \nb.  An  order  declaring  the  conduct  of  defendants \nunconstitutional; \nc.  An order of equitable relief to remediate the harm caused by \ndefendants  unconstitutional  conduct  including  repairs  or \nproperty, establishment of as medical monitoring fund and \nappointing a monitor to oversee the water operations of Flint \nfor a period of time deemed appropriate by the court; \nd.

Defendants caused a pub-\nlic health crisis by exposing Plaintiffs to contaminated water.

Equal protection, race:  Plaintiffs have sustained serious injuries as a \nresult of some of the Defendantsโ decision to deliver a superior water product to \nthe water users in the remainder of Genesee County because that community was \npredominately white, while at the same time delivering a grossly inferior water \nproduct to water users in Flint because that community was predominately African \nAmerican;  \niv.  Equal protection, wealth:  Plaintiffs have sustained serious injuries as \na result  of some of the Defendantsโ decision to protect the health of the water us-\ners in the remainder of Genesee County because that community was predominate-\nly more affluent and at the same time disregard the health of water users in Flint \nbecause that community was predominately poor;   \nv.  Violation of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1985(3):  Plaintiffs have sustained serious in-\njuries as a result of the conspiracy of two or more of the Defendants to directly or \nindirectly conspire to violate Plaintiffsโ constitutional rights, said conspiracy being \nbased on invidious racial animus;  \nvi.  Violation of Elliot Larsen Civil Rights Act (โELCRAโ):  Plaintiffs \nhave sustained serious injuries as a result of their denial of the full and equal en-\njoyment of services provided by some of the Defendants because they were resi-\ndents of a predominately African American community; and \n2 \n \n\n5:15-cv-14002-JCO-MKM   Doc # 111   Filed 05/25/16   Pg 8 of 64    Pg ID 1646\n \nvii.

The City of Flint (โFlintโ) is a municipal corporation, so authorized by \nthe laws of the State of Michigan that operates Department of Public Works and \nprovides water to its residents and property owners as part of its responsibilities \nand services.  Flint is a Defendant  because, despite the protests of a number of \nelected and appointed officials within the organization, the municipal corporation \nitself, through its policies, customs and practices deliberately created, increased and \nprolonged the public health crisis at issue in this case and participated in the con-\ncealment of the harm it caused Plaintiffs.  Flint is also sued because it deprived \nPlaintiffs of their civil and constitutional rights by violating Plaintiffsโ rights to full \nand equal enjoyment of public services as guaranteed under the ELCRA. \n46.

From 1964 to 2014, Flint water users received their water from Lake \nHuron via the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (โDWSDโ).  During this 50 \nyear span, the Flint water users enjoyed safe, clean, fresh water in their homes, \nbusinesses, schools, hospitals and other places of public services.  \n49.  Motivated principally by the actions, political pressure and efforts of \nGenesee County Drain Commissioner Jeffrey Wright, in 2009, the communities of \nFlint, Genesee County, Sanilac County, Lapeer County and City of Lapeer, formed \nthe Karegnondi Water Authority (โKWAโ) to explore the development of a water \ndelivery system which would draw water from Lake Huron and serve as an alter-\nnative to water delivered by the DWSD. \n50.  In 2011, Flint officials commissioned a study to determine if the Flint \nRiver could be safely used by the city as the primary source of drinking water.  The \nโAnalysis of the Flint River as a Permanent Supply for the City of Flint, July 2011โ \n(โ2011 Reportโ), prepared by Rowe  Engineering and  Lockwood,  Andrews and \nNewnam  (โLANโ)  cautioned  against  the  use  of  the  Flint  River  water  and  the \ndormant Flint Water Treatment Plant (โWTPโ) which would cost millions of dol-\nlars to upgrade.  \n51.  Use of the Flint River as a primary drinking source was rejected in \n2011. \n16 \n \n\n5:15-cv-14002-JCO-MKM   Doc # 111   Filed 05/25/16   Pg 22 of 64    Pg ID 1660\n \n52.  In  August  2012,  the  Governor  appointed  Edward  Kurtz  as  Flintโs \nEmergency Manager. \n53.  Throughout 2012, DWSD presented to Kurtz, Wright, Dillon, Walling \nand the Governor compelling arguments, based on numerous studies, demonstrat-\ning that from a cost and water reliability standpoint, Flint needed to reject Wrightโs \npressure to join KWA and continue to receive water from DWSD. \n54.  Most, if not all, discourse about Flint joining KWA or continuing with \nDWSD, included Wright who consistently raised arguments designed to persuade \nKurtz, Dillon and the Governor that the DWSD cost studies were wrong. \n55.  In  late  2012,  Dillon,  reacting  to  Wrightโs  contention  that  the \nDWSD cost studies were wrong, requested the independent engineering firm \nof Tucker, Young, Jackson and Tull (โTYJTโ) to assess whether it would be \ncost-effective for Flint to switch from water supplied by DWSD and join the \nKWA water delivery system. \n56.  In February 2013, TYJT concluded that it would be more cost-\neffective for Flint on both a short term and long term basis to continue to be \nsupplied with water from DWSD. \n57.  On March 27, 2013, MDEQ officials, sensing that Kurtz, Wright, \nWalling and Dillon were pushing the Governor to approve Flint joining the \n17 \n \n\n5:15-cv-14002-JCO-MKM   Doc # 111   Filed 05/25/16   Pg 23 of 64    Pg ID 1661\n \nKWA, acknowledged that the decision to switch the water source for Flint was \nnot based on a scientific assessment of the suitability of the Flint River water.1  \n58.  On March 28, 2013, in an email from Dillon to Governor Rick \nSnyder, with copies to numerous other Treasury officials and Wyant, Dillon \nrecommended that he authorize KWA going forward, even though the independ-\nent firm he hired to perform a cost evaluation said staying with DWSD made the \nmost economic sense.2  Dennis Muchmore, Governor Snyderโs Chief of Staff, \nconfirmed in a subsequent email that it was Dillon who made โthe ultimate deci-\nsionโ to switch Flint water from the DWSD to the KWA. \n59.  On April 16, 2013, Governor Snyder, in what is now understood to be \na non-fiscal decision, authorized Kurtz to enter into a contractual relationship with \nKWA for the purpose of supplying water to Flint beginning in mid-year 2016. \n                                           \n1 The March 2016 Flint Water Advisory Task Force Final Report (โTask Force \nReportโ) is attached  as  Exhibit  A  and  the  Task Force  Timeline is  attached  as \nExhibit B.  Sygo/MDEQ e-mails with Busch re: Flint River water source switch. \nโAs you might guess we are in a situation with Emergency Financial Managers \nso itโs entirely possible that they will be making decisions relative to cost.โ  \nExhibit B, Task Force Timeline at 4.  \n2 Dillion stated in his March 28, 2013 email: โGovernor, based  upon  todayโs \npresentations to the DEQ by the City of Flint, KWA and the engineering firm \n(Tucker Young) Treasury hired to vet the options as to whether Flint should stay \nwith DWSD or join KWA, I am recommending we  support the City of Flint's \ndecision to join KWA. The City's Emergency Manager, Mayor, and City Council \nall  support  this  decision.  Dan  Wyant  likewise  concurs  and  will  confirm  via \nemail.โ   \n \n18 \n \n\n5:15-cv-14002-JCO-MKM   Doc # 111   Filed 05/25/16   Pg 24 of 64    Pg ID 1662\n \n60.  Governor Snyder participated in discussions between his appointed \nEmergency Manager of Flint, Mr. Kurtz, and his appointed Emergency Manager \nof Detroit, Kevin Orr.  At the time the Governor authorized his Emergency Man-\nager to contractually bind Flint to the KWA project, the Governor and State offi-\ncials knew that the Flint River would be used as an interim source. \n61.  In June 2013, Dillon, Kurtz, Wright, and Walling developed an inter-\nim plan (โInterim Planโ) to use the Flint River water before KWA became opera-\ntional. The Interim Plan would cover 2.5 years (April 25, 2014 until approximately \nOctober, 2016). \n62.  Dillon, Kurtz, Wright and Walling knew that in 2011 the Flint River \nwas professionally evaluated and rejected as a drinking source and that upgrades \nfor the Flint WTP would cost millions. \n63.  When the Governor authorized the use of the Flint River as an interim \nsource of water for Flint, he knew that in 2011 the use of the Flint River water as a \nprimary drinking source had been professionally evaluated and rejected as danger-\nous and unsafe. \n64.  The Governor, in a timeline prepared by his office, confirmed that \nin June 2013, he knew that Flint River water would be used as an interim \nsource of water.3  \n                                           \n3  โCity of Flint decides to use the Flint River as a water source, per Gov. \n19 \n \n\n5:15-cv-14002-JCO-MKM   Doc # 111   Filed 05/25/16   Pg 25 of 64    Pg ID 1663\n \n65.  In May 2013, Emergency Manager Kurtz announced his resignation \neffective July 2013.  The Governor reappointed Michael Brown as Flintโs Emer-\ngency Manager.   \n66.  In September 2013, after Emergency Manager Brown resigned, Dar-\nnell Earley was appointed by the Governor as Flintโs Emergency Manager.  \n67.   Michael  Glasgow, the City of Flintโs  water treatment plantโs  la-\nboratory and  water quality supervisor informed the MDEQ on April 16, 2014, \nthat the WTP was not fit to begin operations and that โmanagementโ was not lis-\ntening to him because โthey seem to have their own agenda.โ4  \n68.  On April 25, 2014, under the direction of Emergency Manager Earley \nand State officials from MDEQ, Flint water users began receiving Flint River wa-\nter from their taps even though Glasgow warned that the WTP was not ready. \n                                                                                                                                        \nSnyder timeline.โ  Exhibit A, Task Force Report at 5. \n4 Glasgow said on April 16, 2014 that โ.... it looks as if we will be starting the \nplant up tomorrow  and are being pushed to start  distributing water as soon as \npossible . . . . I would like to make sure we are monitoring, reporting and meeting \nrequirements  before  I  give  the  OK  to  start  distributing water.โ  The  next  day, \nGlasgow wrote  Prysby  and  Busch of the MDEQ, that โโฆ.. I have people  above \nme  making  plans  to  distribute  water  ASAP.  I  was  reluctant  before,  but  after \nlooking at  the monitoring schedule and our current staffing, I do not anticipate \ngiving the OK to begin sending water out anytime soon. If water is distributed \nfrom this plant in the next couple of  weeks, it will be against my direction. I \nneed time to adequately train additional staff and to update our monitoring plans \nbefore I will feel we are ready. I will reiterate this to management  above me, but \nthey seem to have their own agenda.โ   \n \n20 \n \n\n5:15-cv-14002-JCO-MKM   Doc # 111   Filed 05/25/16   Pg 26 of 64    Pg ID 1664\n \n69.  Beginning in June 2013 and continuing through April 25, 2014, the \nState created a dangerous public health crisis for the users of Flint tap water when \nit and Kurtz and Earley ordered and set in motion the use of highly corrosive and \ntoxic Flint River water knowing that the WTP was not ready.  \n70.  For at least a year prior thereto, the State knew that using the Flint \nRiver water was dangerous and could cause serious public health issues.5  \n71.  As early as May 2014, the State knew that it had indeed created a \ndangerous public health crisis yet failed to take any remedial steps.6 \n72.  In June 2014, citizen complaints about contaminated water continued \nwithout the State doing anything to address these complaints.  Many Flint water \nusers reported that the water was making them ill.  \n73.   On October 14, 2014, Flintโs public health emergency was a topic of \nsignificant discussion in the Governorโs office.7  \n                                           \n5 โJanuary 23, 2013:  Mike Prysby/MDEQ e-mails colleague Liane Shekter Smith \nand others about feasibility of Flint switching to the Flint River, highlighting water \nquality concerns.โ Exhibit A, Task Force Report at 16. \n \n6  The  Governorโs  office  received  citizen  complaints  and  was  well  aware  of \nnumerous press  stories about water quality problems as early as May 2014 and \ncontinuing throughout 2015.โ  Id. at 36. \n \n7 โValerie Brader, State Deputy Legal Counsel and Senior Policy Advisor, e-mails \n[on October 14th the]  Governorโs Chief of Staff Dennis Muchmore and other top \naides arguing for a return to DWSD because of water quality problems.

By October 2014, the Governor and his staff knew full well of the \non-going public health threat to the people of Flint yet he did absolutely noth-\ning to assist the desperate people of Flint.8  \n75.  By October 2014, the threat of deadly Legionnaires disease was \nadding to the public health safety crisis.9 (โ[October 2014] Genesee County \nHealth Department initially expresses concern to Flint Water re: increased in-\ncidence of Legionellosis and possible connection to water supply.โ  Exhibit B, \nTask Force Timeline at 7. \n76.  On October 13, 2014, the General Motors Corporation announced \nthat it would no longer use Flint River water in its Flint plant.  Despite this \n                                                                                                                                        \nwith  Emergency  Manager  Darnell  Earley,  who  maintains  the  water  quality \nproblems can be solved and it would be cost-prohibitive to return to DWSD.โ  Id. \nat 17-18.  \n \n8  The Task Force Report was critical of the Governorโs failure to answer the \nFlint  citizen  calls  for  help  in  October  of  2014.    โThe  suggestion  made  by \nmembers of the Governorโs executive staff in October 2014 to switch back to \nDWSD should have resulted, at a minimum, in a full and comprehensive review of \nthe water situation in Flint, similar to that which accompanied the earlier decision \nto switch to KWA.  It was disregarded, however, because of cost considerations \nand repeated assurances that the water was safe.

On January 21, 2105, State officials ordered water coolers to be \ninstalled in State buildings operating in Flint.  State officials were concerned \nthat this action, if it became widely known by the public, would reveal their \ndishonesty because they had been advising the residents of Flint that it was \nsafe to drink the tap water and at the same time arranging for alternative water \nsources for the State employees who were working in Flint.14   \n82.

Crooks noted that Walters complained of โblack \nsediment in her water.โ  She noted that the iron contamination was so high that the \ntesting instrumentation could not measure it.19  \n                                                                                                                                        \n \n18  โBriefing  memo  is  prepared  for  Gov.

In a second email on February 26, 2015, Crooks stated that Miguel \nDel Toral (โDel Toralโ) of the EPA is of the opinion that the โblack sedimentโ in \nthe Walters water was actually lead.20  \n92.  On February 27, 2015, Stephen Busch advised Del Toral that the City \nwas using corrosion control.  This statement was false and Busch knew it was false \nwhen he made this statement to the EPA.21  \n93.  On March 5, 2015, the Governor and officials in the Governorโs \noffice realized that they had a massive public health emergency which proba-\nbly included widespread lead poisoning on their hands and began discussing \ndistributing water filters to Flint water users.  These public officials took no \naction to warn or otherwise protect Plaintiffs and the Class, and continued to \n                                                                                                                                        \nWOW!!!!

By March 10, 2015, James Henry of the GCHD raised concerns \nthat he was being stonewalled by the State and City in accessing public health \ninformation about the Legionella outbreak in Genesee County. The conceal-\nment of the public health emergency by City and State officials โ Defendants \nherein โ was shocking and unconscionable.  \n95.  As of March 10, 2015, the Defendants knew that the extreme pub-\nlic health emergency involved lead poisoning, deadly Legionella bacteria and \na host of other ailments.23  \n                                           \n22 โOfficials in Governor's Office and MDEQ begin discussing providing water \nfilters to Flint citizens.โ  Id. \n \n23  โJames  Henry/GCHD  e-mails  Howard  Croft/Flint  DPW,  Prysby/MDEQ, \nMayor Walling and others citing the cityโs and state's lack of cooperation and \nfailure to respond to his requests for information -โ-โ and a Jan. 2015 FOIA -โ-โ to \nsupport county's investigation of potential causes of Legionellosis outbreak in \nFlint.  โThis is rather glaring information and it needs to be looked into now, \nprior to the warmer summer months when Legionella is at its peak and we are \npotentially faced with a crisis.โโ  Exhibit B, Task Force Timeline at 9.  The \nTask Force Report highlights the government misconduct which prolonged the \ndanger created by the State when it decided to use the highly corrosive Flint River \nwater.  The Task Force stated in its report that โ[a]s the Flint water crisis unfolded, \ncertain state agenciesโ perceived need to defend the original decision to switch to \nthe  Flint  River  and  resist  a  return  to  DWSD  resulted  in  public  relations  and \ncommunications efforts that have, at times, been inappropriate. In the spring and \nsummer of  2015, for example, this perceived need to defend a flawed decision \nmanifested  itself  in  attempts  by  MDEQ  and  MDHHS  to  discredit  accurate \ninformation on lead in drinking water and elevated blood lead levels provided by \n28 \n \n\n5:15-cv-14002-JCO-MKM   Doc # 111   Filed 05/25/16   Pg 34 of 64    Pg ID 1672\n \n96.  On March 25, 2015, Flint City Council voted to re-connect to De-\ntroitโs water system.  Governor Snyderโs appointed Emergency Manager, Gerald \nAmbrose, exacerbated the State-created danger by rejecting this vote of the Flint \npublic officials.24 \n97.  On June 24, 2015, Del Toral of the EPA prepared a memorandum en-\ntitled, โHigh Lead Levels in Flint Michigan-Interim Reportโ (โDel Toral Re-\nportโ).    On the following day, Del Toral wrote an internal email with respect to \nthe elevated lead in Flint water at EPA stating: \nโI understand that this is not a comfortable situation, but the State is \ncomplicit in this and the public has a right to know what they are do-\ning because it is their children that are being harmed.โ \n \n                                                                                                                                        \noutside experts.  Citizen concerns were at times derided and dismissed, in spite of \nthe fact that various members of the Governorโs staff had expressedโand  were \nexpressingโconcerns about the water situation in Flint at the same time.โโฆโฆIn \nany event, the facts in this case point to the reality that state government, as the \nentity in charge of Flint decision-making, failed to protect the health of the cityโs \nresidents. Emphasis added.  Exhibit A, Task Force Report at 37, 40.  \n \n24 The Task Force further notes that in March, 2015, Emergency Manager Ambrose \ncompletely ignored numerous alarms and warnings that the Flint River water was \ndangerous to the health of the Flint water users.  โFlint City Council votes 7-โ1 to \nend  Flint  River  service  and  return  to  Detroit  water service;  the  vote  is  non--\nโbinding  since  Flint  is  under  EM  control.

The Del Toral Report was shared with, among others, MDEQโs Chief \nof  Office  of  Drinking  Water  and  Municipal  Assistance,  Liane  Shekter-Smith, \nMDEQโs Water Treatment Specialist, Patrick Cook, MDEQโs District Supervisor, \nStephen Busch, and MDEQโs Engineer assigned to District 11 (Genesee County), \nand Michael Prysby. \n99.  Nonetheless, State and local public officials failed to undertake any \nmeasures to effectively address any of the dangers, including lead poisoning, iden-\ntified by EPA Agent Del Toral. \n100.   On June 30, 2015, Mayor Walling notified EPA Region 5 Director, \nDr. Susan Hedman (โHedmanโ) that Del Toral was speaking publicly about the \nFlint environmental crisis. \n101.  On July 2, 2015, Hedman advised Walling that he was given a pre-\nliminary draft and that it would be premature to draw any conclusions based on \nthat draft.โ \n102.  On July 10, 2015, MDEQ official Brad Wurfel, in an effort to con-\nceal the public health crisis, appeared on public radio and advised listeners that \nFlint water was safe and that it was not causing โany broad problemโ with lead \nleaching into residential water.  Parents, worried about the lead poisoning of their \n30 \n \n\n5:15-cv-14002-JCO-MKM   Doc # 111   Filed 05/25/16   Pg 36 of 64    Pg ID 1674\n \nchildren demanded answers from Wurfel.  He told the concerned parents, โ[l]et me \nstart here-anyone who is concerned about lead in the drinking water can relax.โ  \nWurfel, at the time he made this statement, knew his statements were false and he \ndeliberately misled the public about the seriousness of the crisis.  \n103.  By July 2015, multiple agencies within the State of Michigan, includ-\ning the Governor, the Governorโs Office and MDEQ, had actual notice of high \nlead exposure and other dangers, including Legionnairesโ disease, associated with \nFlint water. \n104.  On July 22, 2015, Governor Snyderโs Chief of Staff, Dennis Much-\nmore, wrote to MDHHS Director Lyon and stated that the Plaintiffsโ concerns (and \nthose of the Class and the people of Flint) regarding lead poisoning and other dan-\ngers were being โblown offโ by the Defendants.   \n105.  On July 24, 2015, Wurfel continued to promote the cover-up of the \nhealth crisis.  In response to the recognition that the Defendants were blatantly ig-\nnoring the concerns of Flint residents, he stated, โIn terms of near-future issues, \nthe bottom line is that residents of Flint do not need to worry about lead in their \nwater supply, and DEQโs recent sampling does not indicate an imminent health \nthreat from lead or copper.โ \n31 \n \n\n5:15-cv-14002-JCO-MKM   Doc # 111   Filed 05/25/16   Pg 37 of 64    Pg ID 1675\n \n106.  In  August 2015,  Professor  Marc  Edwards of  Virginia  Tech  deter-\nmined that there was serious lead contamination of the Flint water system and stat-\ned that the people of Flint face a major public health emergency.  \n107.  Wurfel, speaking for the State, immediately dismissed and discredited \nEdwards by stating that Edwardsโs  team โonly just  arrived in  town and  (have) \nquickly proven the theory they set out to prove, and while the state appreciates ac-\nademic  participation in this discussion, offering broad, dire public health advice \nbased on some quick  testing could be seen as fanning political flames irresponsi-\nbly.โ \n108.  By late 2014 or early 2015, Lyon was aware from MDHHS data that \nthere was a dramatic increase in the percentage of Flint children with elevated \nblood lead level readings from blood drawn during the second and third quarters of \n2014, and that Legionnairesโ disease was on the rise during the same period of \ntime.  Lyon was aware of this dangerous condition but did nothing to report the \nfindings to the Plaintiffs, their Class or the public. \n109.  Lyon knew that these elevated blood lead levels, and an increase of \nLegionnairesโ disease found in its own database, correlated with the introduction \nof the corrosive Flint River water into the Flint water distribution system.  Lyon \ndid not order that any action be taken to warn the public. \n32 \n \n\n5:15-cv-14002-JCO-MKM   Doc # 111   Filed 05/25/16   Pg 38 of 64    Pg ID 1676\n \n110.  The increase in elevated blood lead levels in Flintโs children, and \nLyonโs failure to do anything to prevent further injury to the people of Flint, iden-\ntifies yet another aspect of this unconscionable government-created health and \npublic safety emergency.  Lyon, aware of the elevated blood lead levels in Flintโs \nchildren, failed to report the evidence to the MDEQ, Governorโs Office, EPA or \nthe Flint community.  His concealment of this critical information increased the \nrisk and exacerbated the danger.25 \n111.  Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, in the summer of 2015, using data available \nto her from Hurley Hospital, observed a similar spike in the percentage of Flint \nchildren with elevated blood lead levels from blood drawn in the second and third \nquarter of 2014.  She published her study in an effort to alert the community about \nthe health risks associated with drinking Flint River water. \n                                           \n25 The Task Force Report states that in July, 2015, the MDHHS knew that there \nwas a spike in elevated blood lead levels of Flint children which correlated with \nthe onset of the Flint River water as a drinking water source for Flint water users.  \nThe MDEQ knew its public statement in September about no elevated blood lead \nlevels was false.  (โJuly 28, 2015: MDHHS epidemiologist Cristin Larder finds that \nchildrenโs  blood  lead  tests  conducted in  summer  2014  โlie outside  the  control \nlimitโ  compared  with  prior  years  and  that  this  finding  โdoes  warrant  further \ninvestigation.โ On the same day, CLPPP data manager Robert Scott analyzes the \ndata over a 5-year period and concludes that โwater was not a major factor.โ  Later \nthat day, CLPPP manager Nancy Peeler concludes that the lack of persistently \nelevated blood lead levels in children in Flint beyond the summer months indicates \nno connection to the change in water in Flint in 2014.  Larder then receives email \ncommunication  from  Peeler:  Peeler  has  concluded  from  CLPPP  data  and \ncommunicated with MDHHS leadership that there is no problem with children's \nlead levels in Flint.โ   Exhibit A, Task Force Report at 20. \n \n33 \n \n\n5:15-cv-14002-JCO-MKM   Doc # 111   Filed 05/25/16   Pg 39 of 64    Pg ID 1677\n \n112.  The Defendants and the MDHHS immediately accused Dr. Hanna-\nAttisha of providing false information to the public. \n113.  In September 2015, the MDEQ continued to falsely assure   the pub-\nlic that use of Flint Water was safe and continued to deny the public health crisis \nat hand.26  \n114.  On September 25, 2015, Wurfel falsely advised media and the public \nthat MDHHS officials have re-examined its blood lead level data and the MDHHS \nstatistics do not show the same upward trend documented by Dr. Hanna-Attisha. \n115.  On September 28, 2015, Wurfel stated publically that the Flint water \ncrisis was becoming โnear-hysteriaโ because of Dr. Hanna-Attishaโs report.  He \nsaid that he wouldnโt call her reports โโฆirresponsible.  I would call them unfortu-\nnate.โ  Wurfel finished his remarks that day by falsely stating that โFlintโs drink-\ning water is safe in that itโs meeting state and federal standards.โ  \n                                           \n26 An example of this type of misleading public statement is found in a MDEQ \ndocument entitled, โDEQ Frequently Asked Questions, Water Lead Levels in the \nCity of Flint, September, 2015โ which stated:  โAre there other ways the city \nmonitors  for  lead  exposure?    The  County  Health  Departments,  overseen \nstatewide by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, regularly \nmonitors blood levels in children throughout Michigan communities.  The leading \ncause of lead poisoning is exposure to lead paint.  Blood lead level testing results \nfor the 12-month period just after the City of Flint changed its water source (May \n2014 โ April 2015) showed no significant change in the pattern of blood lead \nlevels in Flint, compared to the previous three years.  This data suggests the recent \nchange in water source by the City of Flint has not contributed to an increase in \nlead exposure throughout the community.โ  (Emphasis added) \n \n \n34 \n \n\n5:15-cv-14002-JCO-MKM   Doc # 111   Filed 05/25/16   Pg 40 of 64    Pg ID 1678\n \n116.  On  September  29,  2015,  Wurfel  referred  to  EPA  Del  Toral  as  a \nโrogue employee.โ \n117.  By late September 2015, reconnecting to the Detroit water system \nwas the only reasonable option to protect the health and safety of the Flint water \nusers. Yet the State deliberately chose not to proceed in this fashion.  Instead, on \nor about October 2, 2015, State officials announced that the State would appoint a \nFlint Water Advisory  Task Force and would provide water filters designed to \neliminate the lead in the water to Flint water users. \n118.  On October 8, 2015, the Governor recognized that he could no longer \npretend that the water from the Flint River was safe.  He finally ordered Flint to re-\nconnect with the Detroit water system which contained corrosion control chemi-\ncals.  \n119.  The re-connect to DWSD took place on or about October 16, 2015.  \n120.  Flint is currently in a State of Emergency:  Mayor Karen Weaver de-\nclared a State of Emergency on December 14, 2015.  On January 4, 2016, the \nGenesee County Commissioners declared a State of Emergency.  On January 5, \n2016, Governor Snyder declared a State of Emergency.  On January 13, 2016, the \nGovernor activated the Michigan National Guard to assist the people of Flint.  On \nJanuary 14, 2016, the Governor asked President Barak Obama and the Department \nof Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency (โFEMAโ) to de-\n35 \n \n\n5:15-cv-14002-JCO-MKM   Doc # 111   Filed 05/25/16   Pg 41 of 64    Pg ID 1679\n \nclare Flint a Major Disaster.  On January 16, 2016, FEMA issued an emergency \ndeclaration to assist the people of Flint. \n121.  The relief efforts of State public officials have been ineffective, in-\ndeed often frivolous, in mitigating the devastation caused by its creation of the \npublic health crisis.  The ineffective relief efforts have prolonged the dangerous \nconditions and, in many cases, the failed mitigation efforts have further exacerbat-\ned the effects of the public health calamity created by the State. \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n \n122.  Plaintiffs request certification pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P 23(b)(3) on \nbehalf of a proposed damages class defined as follows:  all individuals and entities \nwho from April 25, 2014 to present were exposed to toxic Flint water or who owned \nproperty within the City of Flint and experienced injuries and damages to their per-\nson or property. \n123.  Plaintiffs request certification pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.

The  number  of  class  members  is  sufficiently  numerous  to  make \nclass action status the most practical method for Plaintiffs to secure redress for in-\njuries sustained and to obtain class wide equitable injunctive relief. \n125.  There are questions of law and fact raised by the named Plaintiffs' \nclaims common to those raised by the Class(es) they seek to represent.  Such \ncommon questions predominate over question affecting only individual members \nof the Class(es). \n126.  The  violations  of  law  and  resulting  harms  alleged  by  the  \nnamed Plaintiffs are typical of the legal violations and harms suffered by all Class \nmembers. \n127.  Plaintiff Class representatives will fairly and adequately protect the \ninterests of the Plaintiff Class members.  Plaintiffsโ counsel are unaware of any \nconflicts of interest between the Class representatives and absent Class members \nwith respect to the matters at issue in this litigation; the Class representatives will \nvigorously prosecute the suit on behalf of the Class; and the Class representatives \nare represented by experienced counsel.

Plaintiffsโ attorneys have identified and thoroughly investigated all \nclaims in this action, and have committed sufficient resources to represent the \nClass. \n129.  The maintenance of the action as a class action will be superior to \nother available methods of adjudication and will promote the convenient admin-\nistration of justice.  Moreover, the prosecution of separate actions by individual \nmembers of the Class could result in inconsistent or varying adjudications with re-\nspect to individual members of the Class and/or one or more of the Defendants. \n130.  Defendants have acted or failed to act on grounds generally applica-\nble to all Plaintiffs, necessitating declaratory and injunctive relief for the Class. \nCOUNT I-CAUSE OF ACTION \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 โ 14th AMENDMENT \nSUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS โ STATE CREATED  \nDANGER ALL DEFENDANTS \n \n131.

The conduct of Defendants, all while acting under color of law, en-\ndangered and/or threatened Plaintiffsโ fundamental liberty interest to bodily integ-\nrity as guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution.  \n145.  Defendants were aware that their conduct could result in the depriva-\ntion of Plaintiffsโ fundamental due process rights to bodily integrity  \n146.  Defendants deliberately and knowingly breached the constitutionally \nprotected bodily integrity of Plaintiffs by creating and perpetuating the ongoing \nexposure to contaminated water, with deliberate indifference to the known risks of \nharm which said exposure would, and did, cause to Plaintiffs. \n41 \n \n\n5:15-cv-14002-JCO-MKM   Doc # 111   Filed 05/25/16   Pg 47 of 64    Pg ID 1685\n \n147.

The Equal Protection Clause protects laws and the application of laws \nthat invidiously discriminate between similarly situated individuals or between \ngroups of persons in the exercise of fundamental rights. \n154.  Defendantsโ conduct deliberately exposed Plaintiffs to contaminated \nFlint River water, knowing that it could and would result in widespread serious \ndamage.  \n155.  In 2013, Defendants were required to develop an Interim Plan to de-\nliver water to Genesee County and Flint while the KWA water system was being \nbuilt.  This Interim Plan would be in effect for more than 2.5 years (April 25, 2014 \nuntil approximately October 2016 when the KWA water system would become \noperational.) \n43 \n \n\n5:15-cv-14002-JCO-MKM   Doc # 111   Filed 05/25/16   Pg 49 of 64    Pg ID 1687\n \n156.  These Defendants knew that the water from the Flint River was gross-\nly inferior to the Lake Huron water Flint and Genesee County citizens had been \nreceiving from DWSD. \n157.  These Defendants knew that the raw water from the Flint River would \nhave to be processed at the Flint WTP which would have required millions of dol-\nlars of upgrades. \n158.  These Defendants knew that using the raw water from the Flint River \nhad been rejected as recently as 2011. \n159.  Recognizing  these  facts,  Defendants  devised  an  Interim  Plan  that \ncaused the predominately white water users of those areas of Genesee County out-\nside of Flint to receive the safe and superior water from DWSD, whereas the water \nusers of predominantly African American Flint received water that was known to \nbe  grossly inferior and unsafe, i.e. Flint River water.   \n160.  As evidence of the fact that race discrimination was the reason for \ntreating the two groups of water users differently, the cost of continuing with the \nfinished water product from the DWSD for all water users (both Genesee County \nand Flint) would have been substantially less than the cost of upgrading the Flint \nWTP in order to safely process the raw Flint River water. \n161.  Given the clear difference in the treatment between these two groups \nof similarly situated water users, the deliberate and intentional decisions and ac-\n44 \n \n\n5:15-cv-14002-JCO-MKM   Doc # 111   Filed 05/25/16   Pg 50 of 64    Pg ID 1688\n \ntions of these Defendants in devising the Interim Plan was the product of racial dis-\ncrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.    \n162.  If  Plaintiffsโ  community  had  been  predominately  white,  Plaintiffs \nwould have been treated in the same manner as their predominantly white neigh-\nbors in Genesee County and they too would have received DWSD water as part of \nthe Interim Plan. \n163.  Because Plaintiffs and their Class were water users in a predominately \nAfrican American community, their complaints were dismissed and disrespected as \nexaggerated, without merit or inconsequential.  If Plaintiffsโ community had been \npredominately white, citizen complaints would have been taken seriously, treated \nas valid and the MDEQ and Flint public officials would have taken timely action to \naddress the concerns.27 \n164.

Recognizing these facts, Defendantsโ devised an Interim Plan that al-\nlowed the predominately  more affluent water users of Genesee County to receive \nthe safe superior water from DWSD and the predominately impoverished water us-\ners of Flint would have to accept during the interim period  grossly inferior, previ-\nously rejected and dangerous Flint River water.   \n176.

Given  the  unexplained  difference  in  treatment  between  these  two \ngroups of similarly situated water users, considering the absence of any rational \neconomic justification, and taking into account the economic and class makeup of \nthe group which received the grossly inferior and dangerous water product, the de-\nliberate decisions and actions of these Defendants in devising the Interim Plan can \nfairly be said to be the product of  income and class discrimination, in violation of \nthe Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.   \n48 \n \n\n5:15-cv-14002-JCO-MKM   Doc # 111   Filed 05/25/16   Pg 54 of 64    Pg ID 1692\n \n178.  If Plaintiffsโ community had been predominately more affluent, Plain-\ntiffs would have been treated just like their more affluent neighbors in Genesee \nCounty, and they too would have received DWSD water as part of the Interim Plan. \n179.

Earley, et al.  Page 3\n \n_________________ \nOPINION \n_________________ \nJANE B. STRANCH, Circuit Judge.  These two cases arise from the water contamination \ncrisis in Flint, Michigan.  Plaintiffs, residents of Flint affected by the contaminated city water, \nbring  suit  against  various  state  and  local  officials  and  entities,  alleging  violation  of  their \nconstitutional rights, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, along with other claims.  In Boler, the district \ncourt determined that the ยง 1983 claims were preempted by the Safe Drinking Water Act \n(SDWA)  and  dismissed  the  case  for  lack  of  subject  matter  jurisdiction.    Relying  on  its \npreemption  analysis  in  Boler,  the  court  dismissed  the  Mays  case.    The  cases  have  been \nconsolidated on appeal.  For the reasons explained below, we REVERSE the judgment of the \ndistrict court and REMAND for further proceedings. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nA.  Factual Background \nIn March 2011, the Michigan state Legislature passed the Local Government and School \nDistrict  Fiscal  Accountability  Act  (โAct  4โ),  which  authorized  the  governor  to  appoint  an \nemergency manager for certain local governments.  Act 4 replaced an earlier Michigan law, the \nLocal Government Fiscal Responsibility Act (โAct 72โ), which had been in effect since 1990.  \nAct 72 gave the State power to appoint an emergency financial manager to municipalities facing \nfinancial crises.  Act 4 expanded the scope of the powers granted to these emergency financial \nmanagers and changed their title to simply โemergency managers.โ  New emergency managers \nwere subsequently appointed in several areas; in August 2012, Governor Rick Snyder appointed \nEdward Kurtz in Flint. \nOn November 5, 2012, Michigan voters rejected Act 4 by referendum.  This revived Act \n72.  See Mich. Op. Attโy Gen. No. 7267, 2012 WL 3544658, at *6 (Aug. 6, 2012).  In December, \nthe Michigan Legislature responded by enacting the Local Financial Stability and Choice Act \n(โAct 436โ), effective March 28, 2013.  Under Michigan law, a public act with an appropriations \nprovision is not subject to referendum.  See In re City of Detroit, 504 B.R. 191, 252 (Bankr. E.D. \n\nCase 5:15-cv  -  1  4C0a0s2e-J: E16L--1M6K8M4       E DCoFc uNmo.e 2n0t:1 6  6 f-i2le  d    0F7il/e2d8:/ 1077 / 2  8P/a2g0e1I7D  . 6  9P3a8g e  :  P4age 10 of (3190 of 39)\nNos. 16-1684/17-1144  Boler, et al. v. Earley, et al.  Page 4\n \nMich. 2013) (citing Mich. United Conservation Clubs v. Secโy of State, 464 Mich. 359, 367 \n(2001)).  Unlike Act 4, Act 436 added appropriations provisions that prevented voters from \nsubjecting it to a referendum.  Id. at 251.  Act 436, like Act 4, authorized the State to appoint \nemergency managers with authority to exercise the power of local governments.  See Phillips v. \nSnyder, 836 F.3d 707, 711 (6th Cir. 2016). \nFollowing  the  passage  of  Act  436,  Kurtz  resumed  his  status  as  named  Emergency \nManager for the City of Flint, and remained in that post until July 2013.  In November 2013, \nGovernor Snyder appointed Darnell Earley as Emergency Manager for the City of Flint.  In \nJanuary 2015, Earley was replaced by Gerald Ambrose. \nBetween 1967 and 2014, the City of Flint sourced its water from Lake Huron via the \nDetroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD).  On March 29, 2013, one day after Act 436 \nwent into effect, the City of Flint decided to join a water supplier, the Karegnondi Water \nAuthority (KWA), that was to be established.  Sourcing water for Flint had been under review.  \nIn 2011, Flint had commissioned a study (โ2011 Reportโ or โReportโ) to evaluate the cost of \ntreating water from the Flint River for municipal use as an alternative to either purchasing from \nthe future KWA or continuing its existing contract with DWSD.  The Report determined that \nwater from the Flint River would need to be treated to meet current water safety regulations.  It \nalso concluded that the cost of treating water from the Flint River to provide safe municipal use \nwould be greater than the proposed KWA contract, but less than continuing the contract with \nDWSD.  The officials thus decided to go with the cheapest long-term optionโthe KWA. \nShortly after the decision to switch to the KWA was made, DWSD notified Flint that its \ncurrent contract would terminate in approximately one year, in April 2014.  Because the KWA \nwould take several years to construct, officials were tasked with choosing an interim water \nsource: the Flint River or DWSD.  Officials chose the Flint River.  Genesee County, which \nincludes Flint but is, according to the Defendants, โ[j]urisdictionally separate and distinct from \nthe City of Flint,โ had also decided to switch its future water supply to the KWA.  Unlike the \nCity of Flint, Genesee County officials opted to continue to purchase DWSD water during the \nKWAโs construction.  The Defendants state that this was because Genesee County, unlike Flint, \ndoes not have its own water treatment plant. \n\nCase 5:15-cv  -  1  4C0a0s2e-J: E16L--1M6K8M4       E DCoFc uNmo.e 2n0t:1 6  6 f-i2le  d    0F7il/e2d8:/ 1077 / 2  8P/a2g0e1I7D  . 6  9P3a9g e  :  P5age 11 of (3191 of 39)\nNos. 16-1684/17-1144  Boler, et al. v. Earley, et al.  Page 5\n \nIn April 2014, Flintโs emergency manager changed the source of the cityโs water from \nDWSD to the Flint River.  The plaintiffs assert that at this time, the City knew โthat the Flint \nRiver could not be a source of safe municipal water unless it underwent significant treatment, \nincluding the addition of anti-corrosive agents and treatment for microbial contaminants,โ as \nexplained by the 2011 Report.  The Report itself states that its comparison to other alternatives \nโassumed that the Flint [water treatment plant] w[ould] treat water from the river to provide a \nfinished water of similar quality to other alternatives being considered.โ  There is no evidence \nthat the City upgraded the treatment plants or provided for additional safety measures prior to \nswitching water supply sources on April 25, 2014.  The Defendants contend that they operated in \naccordance with the SDWAโs Lead and Copper Rule, which requires a two-step process that \nbegins with โinitial monitoringโ over two separate six-month periods to determine if treatment is \nrequired.  The first six-month period did not begin until June 2014. \nFollowing the switch to the Flint River, residents immediately began to complain that the \ndrinking water โsmelled rotten, looked foul, and tasted terrible.โ  Larger problems with the water \nsupply soon became apparent.  Testing conducted in August and September 2014 detected \ncoliform and E. coli bacteria in the water supply.  In October 2014, the water was linked to \nLegionnaireโs disease.  General Motors discontinued its water service because the Flint River \nwater was corroding its parts. \nIn January 2015, the City issued a notice that the drinking water violated standards, but \nthat it was safe to drink.  In February 2015, further water testing indicated high levels of \ncontaminants  such  as  lead  and  total  trihalomethane.    The  Defendants  state  that  the  City \nconducted its two required rounds of sampling to determine lead levels, from July to December \n2014 and January to June 2015, but the results did not exceed the SDWA Lead and Copper \nRuleโs โaction level.โ  The results did indicate that corrosion control treatment measures were \nneeded to counteract lead levels, which โhad risen since switching to the Flint River.โ  In March \n2015, the Flint City Council voted to reconnect with DWSD rather than continuing to use the \nFlint River water supply, but the City governmentโs vote was overruled by the Emergency \nManager.   \n\nCase 5:15-cv  -  1  4C0a0s2e-J: E16L--1M6K8M4       E DCoFc uNmo.e 2n0t:1 6  6 f-i2le  d    0F7il/e2d8:/ 1077 / 2  8P/a2g0e1I7D  . 6  9P4a0g e  :  P6age 12 of (3192 of 39)\nNos. 16-1684/17-1144  Boler, et al. v. Earley, et al.  Page 6\n \nOver the next few months, the City issued instructions to residents on their use of water, \nincluding advising them to โpre-flushโ taps prior to use or to stop drinking the water altogether.  \nIn June 2015, the EPA warned of high lead levels in the water.  In response, officials provided \nconsumers with water filters, which the Plaintiffs state did not substantially improve the water \nquality and were incapable of filtering out known contaminants. \nIn October 2015, Genesee County declared a public health emergency in Flint, advising \nresidents not to drink the water.  That same month, the Emergency Manager ordered that Flint \nreconnect to DWSD.  By that point, however, the protective coating in the water supply pipes \nhad been damaged by water from the Flint River, and until the coating could โbuil[d] up to \nappropriate levels,โ the water would continue to have elevated lead levels.  The EPA issued an \nadvisory to Flint residents in February 2016, warning them that unfiltered water was not safe and \nadvising the use of bottled water, especially for young children and pregnant women.  Many of \nthese advisories are currently still in place, and Flint remains in a state of emergency. \nFlint residents have been billed continuously for their water services since April 2014.  \nThe City of Flint has engaged in collection efforts when payments have not been made, including \ndisconnecting water service altogether and issuing liens against real property.  The Defendants \nstate that Michigan is providing funds for the reimbursement of water bills, as well as making \nother efforts to ameliorate the effects of the water crisis. \nOn January 25, 2016, the Michigan Civil Rights Commission passed a resolution to hold \na series of hearings to determine the impact of the Flint water contamination crisis on the civil \nrights of Michiganโs citizens.  The Commission, appointed by the Governor, held three hearings \nthat  included  โexpert  testimony  focusing  on  the  history  of  Flintโs  economy  and  housing, \nenvironmental justice, and the application of the . . . emergency manager law.โ  Michigan Civil \nRights Commission, The Flint Water Crisis: Systemic Racism Through the Lens of Flint iii (Feb. \n17, 2017).

Earley \nPlaintiffs Beatrice Boler, Pastor Edwin Anderson and Mrs. Alline Anderson, and EPC \nSales, LLC, a Flint business, brought a class action on behalf of purchasers of Flint water.  They \nbrought suit against Darnell Earley and Gerald Ambrose, both former emergency managers of \nFlint; Dayne Walling, the former mayor of Flint; the City of Flint; Governor Rick Snyder; the \nState  of  Michigan;  the  Michigan  Department  of  Environmental  Quality  (MDEQ);  and  the \nMichigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS). \nThe Plaintiffs filed suit in the Eastern District of Michigan on January 31, 2016, alleging \ntwelve causes of action, five of them pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983: (1) impairment of the \nconstitutional  right  to  contract;  (2)  deprivation  of  substantive  and  procedural  due  process; \n(3) breach of the duty to protect against state-created danger; (4) breach of the Equal Protection \nClause; and (5) deprivation of property interest without due process or just compensation.  The \nPlaintiffs also alleged claims for (6) conspiracy to deprive them of a constitutional right in \nviolation of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1985; (7) breach of contract; (8) unjust enrichment; (9) breach of \nimplied warranty of merchantability; (10) violation of the Michigan Consumer Protection Act, \nM.C.L. ยง 445.903; (11) conversion; and (12) gross negligence. \nThe  Plaintiffs  filed  a  motion  for  a  preliminary  injunction,  seeking  to  enjoin  the \ndefendants  from  billing  and  collecting  money  from  Flint  residents  for  water.    At  a  status \nconference following briefing on the preliminary injunction, the district court asked the parties to \nprovide supplemental briefing on whether the court had jurisdiction over the case.  The court \nsubsequently dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, finding that the Plaintiffsโ \nยง 1983 claims were precluded by the SDWA, leaving only state law claims over which the court \ndid not have jurisdiction.  The district court did not address the Plaintiffsโ claim under 42 U.S.C. \nยง 1985, but presumably found it similarly preempted by the SDWA.  This appeal followed. \nC.

They sued \nseveral defendants: Governor Snyder; former  Michigan Treasurer Andy Dillon; Director of \nMDHHS Nick Lyon; former director of MDEQ Daniel Wyant and six former MDEQ officials1; \nGenesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright; former Flint Emergency Managers Edward \nKurtz, Darnell Earley, and Gerald Ambrose; former Flint Mayor Dayne Walling and three \nformer Flint city officials2; the State of Michigan; and the City of Flint. \nThe Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint on May 25, 2016.  It alleged six causes of \naction, four of them under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983: (1) violation of substantive due process through \nstate-created  danger;  (2)  violation  of  substantive  due  process  through  an  invasion  of  the \nfundamental right to bodily integrity; (3) intentional race discrimination in violation of the Equal \nProtect Clause; and (4) impermissible wealth-based discrimination in violation of the Equal \nProtection Clause.  The Plaintiffs also asserted that the Defendants (5) engaged in a racially-\nmotivated conspiracy to deny equal protection under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1985, and (6) engaged in \ndiscrimination in violation of Michiganโs Elliot-Larsen Civil Rights Act, M.C.L. ยง 37.2302. \nRelying on its finding of preclusion by the SDWA in Boler, the district court dismissed \nthe Mays Plaintiffsโ ยง 1983 claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1).3  \nThe court also determined that without the ยง 1983 claims, Plaintiffsโ ยง 1985 claim โbased upon \n                                                 \n1\nThese officials, who are sued in their individual capacity, are: Liane Shekter Smith, Chief of the Office of \nDrinking Water and Municipal Assistance for MDEQ; Adam Rosenthal, a Water Quality Analyst assigned to \nMDEQโs Lansing District Office; Stephen Busch, District Supervisor for MDEQโs Lansing District Office; Patrick \nCook, a Water Treatment Specialist assigned to MDEQโs Lansing Community Drinking Water Unit; Michael \nPrysby,  an  engineer  assigned  to  District 11  (Genesee County) of  MDEQ;  and  Bradley Wurfel,  Director of \nCommunications for MDEQ. \n2\nThese former City of Flint officials are: Howard Croft, Director of Public Works; and Michael Glasgow \nand Daugherty Johnson, both Utilities Administrators. \n3\nIn Mays, the district court dismissed the claims pursuant to motions under both 12(b)(1) and (6) but \nspecifically referred to its disposition of Boler.  The Mays Defendants continue to treat this issue as one of \njurisdiction.  The Plaintiffs note that whether their ยง 1983 claims are preempted by the SDWA is probably a merits, \nnot jurisdictional, issue because it goes to the availability of a cause of action rather than the courtโs power to \nadjudicate a case.  Similar cases examining like questions of preemption have arisen as motions to dismiss under \nRule 12(b)(6) or for summary judgment.  See, e.g., Fitzgerald v. Barnstable Sch. Comm., 555 U.S. 246, 249 (2009) \n(district court dismissed ยง 1983 claims based on Rule 12(b)(6)); Mattoon v. City of Pittsfield, 980 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. \n1992) (district court granted summary judgment to defendants on ยง 1983 claims).  We have not found other \ncomparable cases using a Rule 12(b)(1) motion to address statutory preemption of ยง 1983 claims;  it appears that the \ndistrict court incorrectly addressed this issue as jurisdictional.  We nonetheless examine the underlying question of \npreemption. \n\nCase 5:15-cv  -  1  4C0a0s2e-J: E16L--1M6K8M4       E DCoFc uNmo.e 2n0t:1 6  6 f-i2le  d    0F7il/e2d8:/ 1077 / 2  8P/a2g0e1I7D  . 6  9P4a3g e  :  P9age 15 of (3195 of 39)\nNos. 16-1684/17-1144  Boler, et al. v.

Dub Herring Ford, 547 F.3d 558, 560 (6th Cir. \n2008).  Likewise, we review questions of constitutional and statutory interpretations de novo.  \nCommunities for Equity v. Mich. High Sch. Athletic Assโn, 459 F.3d 676, 680 (6th Cir. 2006). \nA.  Preclusion of ยง 1983 Claims by the Safe Drinking Water Act \nThe district courtโs SDWA preemption analysis drew from Middlesex County Sewerage \nAuthority v. National Sea Clammers Association, 453 U.S. 1, 21 (1981), in which the Supreme \nCourt found that the ยง 1983 claims presented were preempted by the statutes alleged.  The court \nprimarily relied on the First Circuitโs determination that the SDWA foreclosed other federal \nremedies for an alleged right to โsafe and potable water.โ  Mattoon v. Pittsfield, 980 F.2d 1, 4โ6 \n(1st Cir. 1992).  The Plaintiffs argue that this is not the proper focus of their claims, and more \nimportantly, that the district court misapplied the standard enunciated by the Supreme Court in \nits line of cases that began with Sea Clammers and concluded with Fitzgerald v. Barnstable \nSchool Committee, 555 U.S. 246, 252 (2009). \nThe provisions of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 may serve as a vehicle for a plaintiff to obtain \ndamages for violations of the Constitution or a federal statute.  Section 1983 provides in part: \nEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or \nusage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to \nbe subjected, any citizen of the United States . . . to the deprivation of any rights, \nprivileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to \nthe party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for \nredress. . . . \nIn  Sea  Clammers,  the  Court  examined  claimsโbrought  under  the  Federal  Water \nPollution Control Act (FWPCA), 33 U.S.C. ยง 1251, and the Marine Protection, Research, and \nSanctuaries Act (MPRSA), 33 U.S.C. ยง 1401, as well as under ยง 1983โalleging violations of \n\nCase 5:15-c v  -  1 C40a0s2e-:J 1E6L--1M68K4M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t0: 16 6  -f2il e  d   F0i7le/2d8: /0177/ 2  8 P/2a0g1e7ID   . 6 P9a4g4e  :   1P0age 16 of (3196 of 39)\nNos. 16-1684/17-1144  Boler, et al. v. Earley, et al.  Page 10\n \nthose  statutes  as  a  result  of  damage  to fishing  grounds  from  pollution.    453  U.S.  at  4โ5.  \nFocusing on Congressโs intent in enacting FWPCA and MPRSA and finding that they provide \nโunusually elaborate enforcement mechanisms,โ the Court held that the plaintiffs could not use \nยง 1983 to enforce their rights under those pollution statutes.  Id. at 13.  The Court compared \nยง 1983 to FWPCA and MPRSA, primarily examining the extensiveness of the remedial scheme \nand  its  relationship  to  congressional  intent:  โ[w]hen  the  remedial  devices  provided  in  the \nparticular Act are sufficiently comprehensive, they may suffice to demonstrate congressional \nintent to preclude the remedy of suits under ยง 1983.โ  Id. at 20.  Based on these statutory \nprovisions, the Court found it โhard to believe that Congress intended to preserve the ยง 1983 \nright of actionโ for violations of the statute.  Id. \nThe  Court  reaffirmed  this  intent-based  analysis  in  subsequent  cases.    In  Smith  v. \nRobinson, 468 U.S. 992 (1984), the plaintiffs brought suit against their childโs school district for \nrelief under both the Education of the Handicapped Act (EHA) and, pursuant to ยง 1983, the Due \nProcess and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Court first looked to \nthe text of the statute and its legislative history and found Congressโs express statements that it \nhad designed the EHA to help the States โcomply[] with their constitutional obligations to \nprovide public education forโ children with disabilities.  Id. at 1009โ10.  It next reviewed the \nstatuteโs procedural mechanisms, focusing on the โcomprehensive nature of the procedures and \nguaranteesโ in the EHA.  Id. at 1010โ11.  The Court concluded that the language of the statute, \nits  legislative  history, and  the  comprehensive  nature  of  its  procedures  and  remedies  reveal \nCongressโs intent that the statute to be the โexclusive avenueโ for plaintiffs to bring all their \nclaims and, thus, ยง 1983 claims were precluded.  Id. at 1012โ13. \nA few years later, in City of Rancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, 544 U.S. 113 (2005), the \nCourt examined preclusion of ยง 1983 claims where the plaintiff sought injunctive relief under the \nTelecommunications Act (TCA), but damages and attorneyโs fees under ยง 1983 for violations of \nthe  federal  statute.    This  returned  the  Court  to  a  comparison  between  statutes,  as  in  Sea \nClammers.  The Court concluded that the detailed and restrictive remedies in the TCA โwere \ndeliberateโ and indicated Congressโs intent that the statutory remedies were โnot to be evaded \nthrough ยง 1983.โ  Id. at 124. \n\nCase 5:15-c v  -  1 C40a0s2e-:J 1E6L--1M68K4M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t0: 16 6  -f2il e  d   F0i7le/2d8: /0177/ 2  8 P/2a0g1e7ID   . 6 P9a4g5e  :   1P1age 17 of (3197 of 39)\nNos. 16-1684/17-1144  Boler, et al. v. Earley, et al.  Page 11\n \nIn  the  most  recent  Supreme  Court  authority  on  these  issues,  Fitzgerald,  the  Court \nexplained the distinction between ยง 1983 claims premised on constitutional violations and those \nbased on statutory violations in determining whether a ยง 1983 claim is precluded.  โIn those \ncases in which the ยง 1983 claim is based on a statutory right, evidence of such congressional \nintent may be found directly in the statute creating the right, or inferred from the statuteโs \ncreation  of  a  comprehensive  enforcement  scheme  that  is  incompatible  with  individual \nenforcement under ยง 1983.โ  Fitzgerald, 555 U.S. at 252.  The Court then explained: \nIn cases in which the ยง 1983 claim alleges a constitutional violation, lack of \ncongressional  intent  may  be  inferred  from  a  comparison  of  the  rights  and \nprotections of the statute and those existing under the Constitution.  Where the \ncontours of such rights and protections diverge in significant ways, it is not likely \nthat Congress intended to displace ยง 1983 suits enforcing constitutional rights.  \nOur conclusions regarding congressional intent can be confirmed by a statuteโs \ncontext. \nId. at 252โ53 (quotation marks and citations omitted).  The Court examined Title IX under this \nframework and found that it contained only an implied private right of action rather than an \nexpress private remedy, lacked a comprehensive remedial scheme, and its substantive protections \ndiverged from those provided by the Equal Protection Clause.  Id. at 256โ58.  The Court \ndetermined that Title IX did not foreclose the plaintiffโs equal protection claim brought under \nยง 1983.  In doing so, it acknowledged that it was mindful of Smithโs admonition to โnot lightly \nconclude  that  Congress  intended  to  preclude  ยง 1983  as  a  remedy  for  a  substantial  equal \nprotection claim.โ  Id. at 256 (quoting Smith, 468 U.S. at 1012).  Indeed, when the Supreme \nCourt found in Smith that the EHA precluded an equal protection constitutional claim under \nยง 1983, the Court based its decision on those three key componentsโthe express language of the \nEHA and its legislative history, the comprehensive nature of remedial scheme, and the Courtโs \nconclusion  that  the  plaintiffsโ  constitutional  claims  were  โvirtually  identical  to  their  EHA \nclaims.โ  Smith, 468 U.S. at 1009โ12. \n  Fitzgerald was preceded and followed by our own cases that articulate standards in line \nwith the test it set out.  We found a ยง 1983 claim under the First Amendment not precluded by \nthe  whistleblower  provisions  of  the  SDWA.    Charvat  v.  E.  Ohio  Regโl  Wastewater  Auth., \n246 F.3d 607, 615 (6th Cir. 2001).

Earley, et al.  Page 12\n \nTitle IX and authorized an equal protection claim under ยง 1983, was part of the circuit split that \npreceded and ultimately led to the Supreme Courtโs decision in Fitzgerald.  See Communities for \nEquity, 459 F.3d at 683โ91. Setting out the governing test, Fitzgerald resolved this circuit split \nby determining, as we did, that Congress did not intend for Title IX to preclude a ยง 1983 remedy \nfor a plaintiffโs equal protection claim.  See 555 U.S. at 256.   \nBased on the case authority set out above, the Plaintiffs in Boler and Mays aver that they \ndo not โinvoke[] ยง 1983 . . . as a vehicle to enforce the substantive federal law found in [the \nSDWA], but as a vehicle to recover for alleged violationsโ of various constitutional provisions, \nincluding the Contract Clause, Equal Protection Clause, and Due Process Clauseโallegations \nthat they state would be actionable even if Congress had never enacted the SDWA.  Communities \nfor Equity, 459 F.3d at 684.  Plaintiffs argue that the fact that Congress โcreated a set of \nsubstantive  statutory  requirements,  and  adopted  a  set  of  procedures  for  enforcing  those \nrequirements, does not . . . suggest that Congress intend[ed] to foreclose a Section 1983 remedy \nfor the violations of independent rights that find their source, not in laws passed by Congress, but \nin the Constitution itself.โ \nThe focus of our inquiry on this question is congressional intent.  See Communities for \nEquity, 459 F.3d at 684 (โThe question of what Congress intended . . . concerns not only which \nremedies Congress sought to provide for [statutory] violations, but whether Congress intended to \nabandon the rights and remedies set forth in [constitutional jurisprudence] when it enacted [the \nstatute].โ).  โThe burden . . . lies with the defendant in a ยง 1983 action to prove preclusion.โ  \nCharvat, 246 F.3d at 615. \n1.  Statutory Text and Legislative History \nThe beginning point for examining congressional intent is the language of the statute.  \nSee  Sea  Clammers,  453  U.S.  at  13  (โWe  look  first,  of  course,  to  the  statutory  language, \nparticularly to the provisions . . . for enforcement and relief.  Then we review the legislative \nhistory and other traditional aids of statutory interpretation to determine congressional intent.โ).  \nWe addressed this very issue in Charvat, and determined that the whistleblower provisions of the \nSDWA and Clean Water Act (CWA) did not preclude the First Amendment claims brought by \n\nCase 5:15-c v  -  1 C40a0s2e-:J 1E6L--1M68K4M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t0: 16 6  -f2il e  d   F0i7le/2d8: /0177/ 2  8 P/2a0g1e7ID   . 6 P9a4g7e  :   1P3age 19 of (3199 of 39)\nNos. 16-1684/17-1144  Boler, et al. v. Earley, et al.  Page 13\n \nthat plaintiff pursuant to ยง 1983.  See 246 F.3d at 613โ15.  Our analysis focused solely on the \nSDWAโs whistleblower provisions; we found that they provide for an administrative remedy \nonly and determined the remedies provided to be insufficiently comprehensive to foreclose relief \nunder ยง 1983.  Id. at 614โ15.  The Plaintiffs argue that Charvat was an application of the \nprinciple that a federal statutory scheme will not preempt independently existing constitutional \nrights when those rights have contours distinct from the statutory claim. \nCharvat does not control our decision here, but we find instructive its analysis that \nemphasizes a focus on the wording of the statute.  That focus accords with Fitzgeraldโs analysis, \nwhich clarifies that review differs depending on whether โthe ยง 1983 claim is based on a \nstatutory rightโ or โalleges a constitutional violation.โ  555 U.S. at 252.  Fitzgerald concludes its \nexplanation of that distinction by noting that โ[c]ontext, not just literal text, will often lead a \ncourt to Congressโ intent in respect to a particular statute.โ  Id. (quoting Rancho Palos Verdes, \n544 U.S. at 127 (Breyer, J., concurring)). \nIn Sea Clammers and Rancho Palos Verdes, the Court determined that the statutory \nremedies at issue were sufficiently comprehensive to evince congressional intent to preclude \nยง 1983 claims for violations of the statute.  In Smith, the Court addressed whether the EHA \nprecludes a ยง 1983 claim based on a constitutional violation and began with a focus on what the \nlegislature said in the Act and its legislative history.  The Court found that specific provisions of \nthe EHA evidenced that it was enacted for the very purpose of allowing children with disabilities \nto pursue their constitutional claims.  See Smith, 468 U.S. at 1009โ12.  Explaining its context, the \nAct noted that โCongress also recognized that in a series of โlandmark court cases,โ the right to \nan equal education opportunity for handicapped children had been established.โ Id. at 1010 \n(quoting  S.  Rep.  No.  94-128,  at  13  (1975),  reprinted  in  1975  U.S.C.C.A.N.  1425,  1425).  \nIn addition to protecting that right, the legislative history stated the purpose of Congress in \npassing the Act: โto provide assistance to the States in carrying out their responsibilities under \nState law and the Constitution of the United States to provide equal protection of the laws.โ  \nSmith,  468  U.S.  at  1010  (quoting  S.  Rep.  No.  94-128,  at  6  (1975),  reprinted  in  1975 \nU.S.C.C.A.N.  1425,  1437)  (emphasis  added).    As  a  result,  the  Court  found  that  the  EHA \n\nCase 5:15-c v  -  1 C40a0s2e-:J 1E6L--1M68K4M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t0: 16 6  -f2il e  d   F0i7le/2d8: /0177/ 2  8 P/2a0g1e7ID   . 6 P9a4g8e  :   1P4age 20 of (3290 of 39)\nNos. 16-1684/17-1144  Boler, et al. v. Earley, et al.  Page 14\n \ncontained  the  expression  of  Congressโs  intention  to  preclude  a  ยง  1983  claim  based  on  a \nconstitutional violation. \nWe examine the Safe Drinking Water Act in light of the analysis employed by these \nprecedent cases.  The language of the SDWA centers on instructions to the EPA to establish the \nrequirements for national drinking water standards.  See 42 U.S.C. ยง 300g-1.  Its provisions set \nout  standards  identifying  particular  contaminants  selected  for  regulation  and  establishing \nmaximum levels that limit the amount of those specified contaminants permitted in public \ndrinking water systems.  See id. ยง 300g-1(b).  The statutory language also specifies the time \nframe  for  the  EPAโs  promulgation  of  regulations,  the  use  of  science  in  the  EPAโs \ndecisionmaking, and the technology by which public systems should achieve compliance with \nthe standards.  See id. \nThe Defendants have not pointed to any indications of preclusive intent in the text or \nlegislative history of the SDWA in their briefing, nor were they able to do so at argument.  The \nPlaintiffs point to portions of the text and legislative history of the SDWA that they suggest show \nthe statute was not intended to foreclose ยง 1983 claims for constitutional rights.  For example, \nthe SDWA was adopted pursuant to Congressโs power under the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. \nArt. I, ยง 8, rather than its power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to enforce \nconstitutional rights.  See Nebraska v. E.P.A., 331 F.3d 995, 999 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (stating that \nโthe Commerce Clause provides the constitutional authority forโ the SDWA).  Accordingly, the \nPlaintiffs note that the findings enunciated in the SDWA emphasize Congressโs focus on the \ninterstate economic impacts of polluted drinking water, not on any constitutional violations that \nmay accompany the pollution. \nUnlike  the  EHA  examined  in  Smith,  the  SDWA  does  not  use  language  related  to \nconstitutional rights, or codify legal standards that appeared in prior cases to enforce rights \nguaranteed by the Constitution.  See Smith, 468 U.S. at 1009โ10.  We find no clear inference \nfrom either the text of the statute or its legislative history that Congress intended for the SDWAโs \nremedial scheme to displace ยง 1983 suits enforcing constitutional rights.  This, in turn, informs \nour  next  stepโevaluating  the  comprehensiveness  of  the  remedial  scheme  provided  by  the \nstatute. \n\nCase 5:15-c v  -  1 C40a0s2e-:J 1E6L--1M68K4M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t0: 16 6  -f2il e  d   F0i7le/2d8: /0177/ 2  8 P/2a0g1e7ID   . 6 P9a4g9e  :   1P5age 21 of (3291 of 39)\nNos. 16-1684/17-1144  Boler, et al. v. Earley, et al.  Page 15\n \n2.  Remedial Scheme \nLacking textual support from the statute or its legislative history, the Defendants contend \nthat the SDWAโs remedial scheme is so comprehensive that it demonstrates congressional intent \nto preclude remedies under ยง 1983.  They argue that the remedial provisions of the SDWA are \nsimilar to those examined in Sea Clammers which, along with the First Circuitโs holding in \nMattoon, should direct our inquiry and conclusion, as they did that of the district court. \nThe SDWAโs remedial scheme authorizes the EPA Administrator to compel compliance \nwith  the  standards  promulgated  by  the  statute,  42  U.S.C.  ยง  300g-3(b),  and  to  assess  civil \npenalties against violators of SDWA regulations.  Id. ยง 300g-3(g)(3).  The statute also provides \nfor judicial review of the Administratorโs actions, including the establishment of drinking water \nregulations, id. ยง 300j-7(a), and contains a citizen-suit provision allowing a private action against \nany person in violation of the statute for injunctive relief.  Id. ยง 300j-8.  Plaintiffs bringing claims \nunder the SDWA must also comply with certain procedural requirements, including providing a \nnotice of intent to potential defendants 60 days prior to filing suit.  Id. ยง 300j-8(b)(1)(A).  This \nremedial scheme contains a number of similarities to the schemes in the pollution statutes in Sea \nClammers. \nThe Plaintiffs respond that the SDWAโs savings clause, id. ยง 300j-8(e), demonstrates that \nCongress intended to preserve independent remedies for conduct also violating the statute.  The \nsavings clause states that โ[n]othing in this section [establishing the SDWAโs private right of \naction] shall restrict any right which any person (or class of persons) may have under any statute \nor common law to seek enforcement of any requirement prescribed by or under this subchapter \nor to seek any other relief.โ  Id. ยง 300j-8(e).  Sea Clammers rejected a similar argument about the \nFWPCA and MPRSAโs savings clauses, which were similarly worded.  See Sea Clammers, \n453 U.S.  at  20  n.31.    The  Court  found  that  it  was  โdoubtful  that  the  phrase  โany  statuteโ \ninclude[d] the very statute in which [that] statement was contained.โ  Id. at 15โ16.  But that \ndetermination was premised on violations of the statute itself.  The Court also recognized that the \nsavings clause was intended to โallow further enforcement of antipollution standards arising \nunder other statutes or state common law.โ  Id. at 20 n.31; see also Guertin v. State of Mich., No. \n16-cv-12412, 2017 WL 2418007, at *13โ14 (E.D. Mich. June 5, 2017) (finding that the โrobust \n\nCase 5:15-c v  -  1 C40a0s2e-:J 1E6L--1M68K4M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t0: 16 6  -f2il e  d   F0i7le/2d8: /0177/ 2  8 P/2a0g1e7ID   . 6 P9a5g0e  :   1P6age 22 of (3292 of 39)\nNos. 16-1684/17-1144  Boler, et al. v.

The language of the SDWAโs savings clause lends support to a \nconclusion that Congress contemplated leaving open ยง 1983 as an avenue of relief for claims \narising under the Constitution. \nWe pause to address Mattoon, which we do not find dispositive.  The plaintiffs in \nMattoon brought claims premised on SDWA violations, and a claim of infringement of an \nalleged โconstitutional right to safe drinking water.โ  980 F.2d at 5.  The Plaintiffs here do not \nallege that violation, but rather bring claims for violations of specific constitutional provisions \nincluding  the  Contract  Clause,  Equal  Protection  Clause,  and  Due  Process  Clause.    More \nimportantly,  the  First  Circuitโs  conclusion  predated  Fitzgerald,  where  the  Supreme  Court \nexplained that when reviewing cases in which the ยง 1983 claim alleges a constitutional violation, \nthe appropriate framework is to seek to infer congressional intent from the text and legislative \nhistory of the statute, review the nature and extent of the remedial scheme, and compare the \nrights and protections of the statute with those found in the Constitution.  See Fitzgerald, \n555 U.S. at 252. \nCommunities for Equity teaches that where constitutional claims such as those here are at \nissue, the question of congressional intent โconcerns not only what remedies Congress sought to \nprovideโ for SDWA violations, โbut whether Congress intended to abandon the rights and \nremedies set forth in Fourteenth Amendment equal protection jurisprudenceโ when it enacted the \nSDWA.  459 F.3d at 684. \nThe SDWAโs remedies are more limited than those generally available under ยง 1983, as \nthe statute provides for injunctive relief only, not for recovery of damages or other monetary \nrelief available to Plaintiffs with successful ยง 1983 claims.  Though the statute contains a private \nright of action, it also includes a savings clause establishing that its private action does not \nrestrict rights a person may exercise outside the SDWA.  The availability of a private judicial \nremedy in the SDWA, moreover, does not conclusively establish congressional intent to preclude \nrelief under ยง 1983.  Rancho Palos Verdes, 544 U.S. at 122.  Rather, we examine whether there \nare statutory indications โexpress or implicitโ that the remedy is meant to โcomplement, rather \n\nCase 5:15-c v  -  1 C40a0s2e-:J 1E6L--1M68K4M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t0: 16 6  -f2il e  d   F0i7le/2d8: /0177/ 2  8 P/2a0g1e7ID   . 6 P9a5g1e  :   1P7age 23 of (3293 of 39)\nNos. 16-1684/17-1144  Boler, et al. v. Earley, et al.  Page 17\n \nthan supplant, ยง 1983.โ  Id.  And we do so in accordance with Fitzgeraldโs admonition that we \nshould be โmindfulโ to โnot lightly conclude that Congress intended to preclude reliance on \nยง 1983 as a remedy for a substantial [constitutional] claim.โ  Fitzgerald, 555 U.S. at 252. \nIn the context of the SDWA and its text and legislative history, we find that the remedial \nschemes in the SDWA are not so comprehensive as to demonstrate congressional intent to \npreclude  remedies  under  ยง 1983  for  constitutional  violations.    This  leaves  us  with  the  last \nconsideration set out in Fitzgeraldโs frameworkโa comparison of the substantive rights and \nprotections of the SDWA to the protections provided by the relevant constitutional provisions.  It \nis Defendantsโ burden to show that this comparison reveals a congressional intention for the \nSDWA to preclude remedies provided for under ยง 1983. \n3.  Contours of the Rights and Protections \nFitzgerald teaches that in examining the SDWA, we ask whether โthe contours of the \nrights  and  protectionsโ  provided  by  the  SDWA  and  those  existing  under  the  Constitution \nโdiverge in significant ways.โ  Fitzgerald, 555 U.S. at 252.  If they do, this โlends further support \nto the conclusion that Congress did not intend [the statute] to preclude ยง 1983 constitutional \nsuits.โ  Id. at 256.  In Fitzgerald, the Court highlighted Title IXโs protections as โnarrower in \nsome respects and broader in others,โ and determined that this divergent coverage, along with the \nlack of a sufficiently comprehensive remedial scheme, showed that the statute was not intended \nto foreclose ยง 1983 relief.  Id. at 256, 258.  The Court examined the reach of Title IXโs remedial \nscheme  as  compared  to  the  ยง  1983  claims,  activities  exempt  under  the  statute  that  could \nnonetheless  form  the  basis  for  equal  protection  claims,  and  the  congruity  of  standards  for \nestablishing liability where particular activities and defendants might be subject to actions under \nboth Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause.  Id. at 257โ58.  It highlighted that claims brought \nto enforce the safeguards of the Equal Protection Clause reach only state actors, while Title IX \nreaches  โinstitutions  and  programs  [receiving]  federal  funds,  which  may  include  nonpublic \ninstitutions.โ    Id.  at  257  (citations  omitted).    The  Court  illustrated  how  the  standards  for \ngoverning liability were not congruent: a Title IX plaintiff could establish deliberate indifference \nand school district liability for harassment through the conduct of โa single school administrator \nwith authority,โ but a similar equal protection claim against the district, brought via ยง 1983, \n\nCase 5:15-c v  -  1 C40a0s2e-:J 1E6L--1M68K4M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t0: 16 6  -f2il e  d   F0i7le/2d8: /0177/ 2  8 P/2a0g1e7ID   . 6 P9a5g2e  :   1P8age 24 of (3294 of 39)\nNos. 16-1684/17-1144  Boler, et al. v. Earley, et al.  Page 18\n \nwould require showing that โthe harassment was the result of municipal custom, policy, or \npractice.โ  Id. at 257โ58 (citation omitted). \nThe Plaintiffs emphasize the divergence between the rights protected by the SDWA and \nthose protected by their constitutional claims.  The Defendants maintain that the ยง 1983 claims \nare, at their heart, based on misconduct addressed by the SDWA, arguing that they have the same \nfactual basis as potential SDWA claims and that the allegations made in the Plaintiffsโ complaint \nstem from responsibilities and duties imposed by the SDWA. \nThe  SDWAโs  citizen-suit  provision  authorizes  action  against  โany  person,โ  which \ntherefore reaches both nonpublic actors as well as the state actors covered by ยง 1983.  See \n42 U.S.C. ยง 300j-8(a).  But even with some overlap in coverage, the substantive standards within \nthe statute diverge significantly from the protections afforded by the Constitution.  The Boler \nPlaintiffs allege violations of several constitutional provisions, including the Contract Clause, \nDue Process Clause, and Equal Protection Clause.  The Mays Plaintiffs also allege due process \nand equal protection violations.  All Plaintiffs argue that each of these constitutional rights \ndiverge significantly from the rights and protections provided by the SDWA.  We agree. \nThe distinct coverage of the Equal Protection Clause provides a clear example.  The \ncitizen-suit provision allows a plaintiff to file a SDWA action to โenforce . . . any requirement \nprescribed by or underโ the statute.  Id.  The SDWA establishes maximum contaminant levels \nthrough its national primary drinking water regulations, which most public water systems may \nnot exceed.  Id. ยง 300g-1.  These regulations reach only certain harmful contaminants in drinking \nwater, and do not redress harms caused by many other contaminants that are unregulated by the \nSDWA.  Establishing a violation of the statute does not require proof of intent or meeting any \nspecific standard beyond showing contaminant levels in excess of the maximum established by \nthe regulations.  The statute would thus cover both intentional and negligent conduct, as long as \nit violated the regulation. \nIn a wide variety of circumstances, conduct that violates the SDWA might not violate the \nEqual Protection Clause, and vice versa.  For example, a government entity could provide water \nthrough a public system with contaminant levels in excess of national drinking water standards \n\nCase 5:15-c v  -  1 C40a0s2e-:J 1E6L--1M68K4M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t0: 16 6  -f2il e  d   F0i7le/2d8: /0177/ 2  8 P/2a0g1e7ID   . 6 P9a5g3e  :   1P9age 25 of (3295 of 39)\nNos. 16-1684/17-1144  Boler, et al. v. Earley, et al.  Page 19\n \nwithout infringing on any equal protection principles.  Likewise, a government entity could \nprovide some customers with water that meets the requirements of SDWA standards, but that is \nnonetheless dirtier, smellier, or of demonstrably poorer quality than water provided to other \ncustomers.  The water also could be polluted by a contaminant not regulated by the SDWA.  \nEven though not violating the SDWA, these situations could create an equal protection issue, \nparticularly if such distinction were based on intentional discrimination or lacked a rational basis. \nA Due Process Clause example further highlights this divergence in coverage.  The Mays \nand Boler Plaintiffs both allege that the Defendants denied them due process of law through the \nstate-created danger doctrine, by exposing them to the contaminated water sourced from the Flint \nRiver.  Establishing a due process violation through the state-created danger doctrine requires \nshowing: \n(1) an affirmative act by the state which either created or increased the risk that \nthe plaintiff would be exposed to an act of violence by a third party; (2) a special \ndanger to the plaintiff wherein the stateโs actions placed the plaintiff specifically \nat risk, as distinguished from a risk that affects the public at large; and (3) the \nstate knew or should have known that its actions specifically endangered the \nplaintiff. \nJones v. Reynolds, 438 F.3d 685, 690 (6th Cir. 2006) (citations omitted).  The plaintiff โmust \ndemonstrate that the state acted with the requisite culpability to establish a substantive due \nprocess  violation  under  the  Fourteenth  Amendment,โ  which  varies  depending  on  the \ncircumstances.  Ewolski v. City of Brunswick, 287 F.3d 492, 510 (6th Cir. 2002).  A deliberate \nindifference standard is used to establish culpability โin settings [that] provide the opportunity \nfor  reflection  and  unhurried  judgments,  but  .  .  .  a  higher  bar  may  be  necessary  when \nopportunities for reasoned deliberation are not present.โ  McQueen v. Beecher Cmty. Schs., \n433 F.3d 460, 469 (6th Cir. 2006) (quotation marks and citations omitted). \nA violation of the SDWA that does not meet a deliberate indifference standard, such as a \nstate actorโs negligent action resulting in contaminant levels above the established maximum, \nplainly would not meet the requirements of a due process violation.  Likewise, a state actorโs \ndeliberately indifferent action concerning contaminants in public water systems, which created a \nspecial danger to a plaintiff that the state knew or should have known about, could violate the \n\nCase 5:15-c v  -  1 C40a0s2e-:J 1E6L--1M68K4M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t0: 16 6  -f2il e  d   F0i7le/2d8: /0177/ 2  8 P/2a0g1e7ID   . 6 P9a5g4e  :   2P0age 26 of (3296 of 39)\nNos. 16-1684/17-1144  Boler, et al. v. Earley, et al.  Page 20\n \nDue Process Clause without also violating the SDWA, if the hypothetical contaminants did not \nexceed the statutory maximums or were not regulated by it. \nUnder some circumstances, actions that violate the SDWA may also violate the Equal \nProtection Clause or Due Process Clause.  The Defendants argue that this is necessarily the case, \nand that the Plaintiffsโ claims could not be pursued without showing a violation of the SDWA.4  \nBut as noted, that is often not the case, particularly where the SDWA does not even regulate a \ncontaminant harmful to public drinking water users.  The contours of the rights and protections \nof the SDWA and those arising under the Constitution, and a plaintiffโs ability to show violations \nof each, are โnot . . . wholly congruent.โ  Fitzgerald, 555 U.S. at 258.  This further supports the \nconclusion that Congress did not intend to foreclose ยง 1983 suits by enacting the SDWA. \nThe Defendants also appear to argue that the Plaintiffs have not actually shown that their \nconstitutional rights were violated, as pled by the Complaints filed in Boler and Mays.  But these \narguments  are  irrelevant  to  the  preemption  question  at  handโparticularly  because  the \nDefendantsโ arguments seek to address the merits of the claims, and the district court apparently \ntreated the issue of preclusion as jurisdictional.  The Defendants urge us to consider the due \nprocess  claims  as  pled  in  these  cases,  and  determine  that  the  Complaints  do  not  establish \nconstitutional violations. At the motion to dismiss stage, however, we focus on the availability of \na cause of action, not whether the plaintiffs have proven that these constitutional rights were \nviolated. \nHaving resolved that there is no textual indication in the SDWA that Congress expressly \nchose  to  preempt  ยง  1983  claims  and  that  the  provisions  of  the  remedial  scheme  do  not \ndemonstrate such an intention, we also find that the contours of the rights and protections found \nin the constitutional claims diverge from those provided by the SDWA such that we infer lack of \ncongressional intention to foreclose ยง 1983 claims.  The Defendants have not demonstrated that \nโCongress intended to abandon the rights and remedies set forth in Fourteenth Amendment equal \n                                                 \n4\nThe Defendants also argue that the Plaintiffsโ claims rest on a constitutional right to safe drinking water, \nwhich no courts have found to be a fundamental right.  But the Plaintiffs explicitly deny that they seek to enforce \nsuch a right, or that their claims must rest on such a right.  This argument appears principally to concern the \nPlaintiffsโ substantive due process claims.  But to show that the state-created danger doctrine or a personโs \nfundamental right to bodily integrity have been violated, a Plaintiff does not need to establish any constitutional \nsignificance to the means by which the harm occursโin this case, unsafe drinking water. \n\nCase 5:15-c v  -  1 C40a0s2e-:J 1E6L--1M68K4M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t0: 16 6  -f2il e  d   F0i7le/2d8: /0177/ 2  8 P/2a0g1e7ID   . 6 P9a5g5e  :   2P1age 27 of (3297 of 39)\nNos. 16-1684/17-1144  Boler, et al. v.

Communities for Equity, 459 F.3d at 684.  \nUnder the governing precedent, primarily that of the Supreme Court, the Defendants have not \ncarried their burden and the Plaintiffs may thus move forward with their cases.  We find that the \nSDWA does not preclude ยง 1983 claims as pled by the Boler and Mays Plaintiffs, and reverse the \ndistrict courtโs dismissal of their Complaints on that basis. \nB.  Section 1985 Claims \nThe Plaintiffs also brought claims under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1985(3), alleging that the defendants \nconspired to deprive them โof the equal protection of the laws, or of equal privileges and \nimmunities under the laws.โ  The district court did not address this claim when dismissing Boler, \npresumably finding that it failed because the plaintiffsโ ยง 1983 claims were preempted by the \nSDWA.    In  Mays,  the  district  court  explicitly  dismissed  the  Plaintiffsโ  ยง  1985(3)  claim, \ndetermining  that  โ[w]ithout  viable  constitutional  claimsโ  under  ยง  1983,  the  Plaintiffsโ \nโconspiracy claim under ยง 1985(3) based upon the same conduct also fails.โ  Since we find that \nthe SDWA does not preclude the Plaintiffsโ ยง 1983 claims, we likewise reverse the district \ncourtโs dismissal of their claims brought under ยง 1985(3). \nC.  Eleventh Amendment Sovereign Immunity \nThe State of Michigan, Governor Snyder, MDEQ, and MDHHS (collectively, โState \nDefendantsโ)  argue  that  the  Eleventh  Amendment  serves  as  a  separate  and  independent \njurisdictional bar to the plaintiffsโ claims against them.  The Boler Plaintiffs respond that the \nState  Defendantsโ  conduct  in  litigation  constitutes  waiver  of  their  Eleventh  Amendment \nprotections.  Both the Boler and Mays Plaintiffs assert that the Ex Parte Young doctrine applies \nto their claims against Governor Snyder. \nThough  not  addressed  by  the  district  court,  we  examine  the  question  of  sovereign \nimmunity as part of our continuing obligation to consider our jurisdiction over the appeal.  \nPuckett v.

Earley, et al.  Page 22\n \n& Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 100 (1984).  Sovereign immunity โdoes not extend to \ncounties and similar municipal corporations,โ such as the defendants associated with the City of \nFlint in these cases.  Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 280 (1977).  \nThere are three exceptions to sovereign immunity: (1) when the state has waived immunity by \nconsenting  to  the  suit;  (2)  when  Congress  has  expressly  abrogated  the  statesโ  sovereign \nimmunity, and (3) when the doctrine set forth in Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908), applies.  \nSee Puckett, 833 F.3d at 598.  Section 1983 does not abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity.  \nWill v. Mich. Depโt of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 66 (1989) (stating that Congress did not intend \nto โdisturb the Statesโ Eleventh Amendment immunityโ by passing ยง 1983).  As a result, only the \nother two exceptionsโconsent or the application of Ex Parte Youngโmay apply in these cases. \n1.  State Waiver Via Conduct in Litigation in Boler \nConsent to a suit may be indicated expressly, or โtake the form of a voluntary appearance \nand defense on the merits in federal court.โ  Lawson v. Shelby Cty., 211 F.3d 331, 334 (6th Cir. \n2000).  Removing an action from state to federal court will constitute waiver.  Lapides v. Bd. of \nRegents of the Univ. Sys. of Ga., 535 U.S. 613, 616 (2002).  But appearance in court to present \ncertain  defenses,  such  as  a  statute  of  limitations  argument,  is  not  a  defense  on  the  merits \nindicating waiver of immunity.  See Akers v. Cty. of Bell, 498 F. Appโx 483, 490 (6th Cir. 2012).  \nIn Ku v. Tennessee, 322 F.3d 431, 435 (6th Cir. 2003), we determined that by engaging in \nsubstantial discovery, filing a motion for summary judgment, and only raising an Eleventh \nAmendment defense after an adverse ruling on the summary judgment motion, the State of \nTennessee  had  voluntarily  invoked  jurisdiction  sufficient  to  waive  its  sovereign  immunity \ndefense. \nThe  Boler  Plaintiffs  first  argue  that  the  State  Defendantsโ  conduct  in  litigation \ndemonstrates their consent to the suit, specifically by passing legislation with the intent of \naffecting the Plaintiffsโ claims.  Public Act 24, which provided $30 million in appropriations for \nthe Flint water crisis, was signed into law on February 26, 2016, two days after the Plaintiffs \nfiled for a preliminary injunction.  The Plaintiffs assert that the State Defendants increased their \nefforts  to  pass  Act  24  only  after  they  knew  the  motion  for  a  preliminary  injunction  was \nimminent, and that the legislation was passed in part to be used as a โtool in litigation.โ  As \n\nCase 5:15-c v  -  1 C40a0s2e-:J 1E6L--1M68K4M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t0: 16 6  -f2il e  d   F0i7le/2d8: /0177/ 2  8 P/2a0g1e7ID   . 6 P9a5g7e  :   2P3age 29 of (3299 of 39)\nNos. 16-1684/17-1144  Boler, et al. v. Earley, et al.  Page 23\n \nevidence, the Plaintiffs point to the State Defendantsโ briefing on jurisdiction before the district \ncourt, where they argued that Act 24 โmootedโ the Plaintiffsโ requests for relief.  The Plaintiffs \nargue that this conduct, as well as the State Defendantsโ participation in settlement negotiations, \ndemonstrates their consent to litigation in the interests of reaching a resolution on the merits. \nAs support, the Plaintiffs cite Vaquerias Tres Monjitas, Inc. v. Comas, 992 F. Supp. 2d \n39, 47 (D.P.R. 2013), where the court stated that โonce the Government voluntarily agreed to use \npublic fundsโ to compensate the plaintiffs for their losses as a result of pricing violations, the \nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico โexpressly waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity by its \nconduct in litigation.โ  The court also found that the Commonwealthโs participation in settlement \nagreements further confirmed this waiver.  Id.  However, on appeal, the First Circuit forcefully \nstated  that  the  district  courtโs  determination  that  Puerto  Rico  had  waived  its  Eleventh \nAmendment immunity was โin no sense necessary to . . . entry of the judgment,โ and that the \nstatements  were  โdicta,โ  โwholly  gratuitous,โ  and  โha[d]  the  obvious  effect  of  causing \nconfusion.โ  Vaquerias Tres Monjitas, Inc. v. Pagan, 748 F.3d 21, 23 (1st Cir. 2014).  The First \nCircuit emphasized that the โstandard for finding [Eleventh Amendment] waiver is a stringent \none,โ and strongly suggested that the district court amend the order to delete the language.  Id. at \n27.  The applicability of the district courtโs opinion in Vaquerias is therefore quite limited.  Nor \nhave  we  found  other  support  for  the  proposition  that  encouraging  the  passage  of  an \nappropriations bill that might affect a plaintiffโs claims or engaging in settlement negotiations \nwould constitute conduct in litigation that indicates consent to waive sovereign immunity. \nThough we find that the State Defendants have participated in some litigation conduct, \ntheir actions do not rise to the level of a waiver of their Eleventh Amendment immunity.  We \nnote that their defense that the SDWA precludes the Plaintiffsโ ยง 1983 claims is arguably a \nโdefense on the merits in federal court,โ Lawson, 211 F.2d at 334, since other courts have \ntypically treated similar claims as merits issues rather than threshold questions of jurisdiction.  \nBut since the district court considered the argument to be jurisdictional and the Boler appeal \nfollows  from  the  courtโs  ruling  on  a  12(b)(1)  motion,  we  find  that  the  State  Defendantsโ \nparticipation in the argument does not constitute a defense on the merits. \n\nCase 5:15-c v  -  1 C40a0s2e-:J 1E6L--1M68K4M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t0: 16 6  -f2il e  d   F0i7le/2d8: /0177/ 2  8 P/2a0g1e7ID   . 6 P9a5g8e  :   2P4age 30 of (3390 of 39)\nNos. 16-1684/17-1144  Boler, et al. v. Earley, et al.  Page 24\n \nWe also note that the State Defendants presented a defense to the Boler Plaintiffsโ motion \nfor a preliminary injunction, arguing against the merits of the case without raising the issue of \nsovereign immunity.  Nor did the issue arise in the defendantsโ Joint Statement of Resolved and \nUnresolved Issues.  The State Defendants first invoked the defense of sovereign immunity in \ntheir Supplemental Brief for Jurisdictional Arguments, which was prompted by the district court \nat a status conference.  Nonetheless, this participation in litigation does not rise to the level of \nwaiver.  In Ku, Tennessee only raised an Eleventh Amendment defense after โengaging in \nsubstantial discovery, filing a motion for summary judgment,โ and the district court had issued a \nโfinal adverse ruling.โ  322 F.3d at 432; see also Hunter v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Elections, \n850 F. Supp. 2d 795, 801โ02 (S.D. Ohio 2012) (finding that the Board of Elections, which was \nan arm of the state, had waived Eleventh Amendment immunity by participating in extensive \npre-trial activities before the district court and Sixth Circuit, including appealing the district \ncourtโs order granting a preliminary injunction, participating in a discovery conference, and \nfiling a trial brief).  The State Defendantsโ conduct does not rise to the same level in this \ninstance, where the district court never issued any final judgments before the motion to dismiss \nand the parties had not yet engaged in discovery.  We find that the State Defendants have not \nwaived their sovereign immunity, and affirm the district courtโs dismissal of the Boler Plaintiffsโ \nclaims against the State of Michigan, MDEQ, and MDHHS on this basis.5 \n2.  The Ex Parte Young Doctrine \nThe  exception  set  forth  in  Ex  Parte  Young  allows  plaintiffs  to  bring  claims  for \nprospective relief against state officials sued in their official capacity to prevent future federal \nconstitutional or statutory violations, โregardless of whether compliance might have an ancillary \neffect on the state treasury.โ  S & M Brands, Inc. v. Cooper, 527 F.3d 500, 507 (6th Cir. 2008) \n(citations omitted).  But the doctrine does not extend to retroactive relief or claims for money \ndamages.  Id. at 508; see also Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 663 (1974).  To determine if \nEx Parte Young applies, we โneed only conduct a โstraightforward inquiry into whether [the] \ncomplaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly characterized as \n                                                 \n5\nThe Boler Plaintiffs also argue that the State Defendants, through operation of the Emergency Manager \nlaw, became agents and servants of the City of Flint, which does not have Eleventh Amendment immunity.  The \nPlaintiffs offer no support for this argument, and it does not overcome the Eleventh Amendment bar. \n\nCase 5:15-c v  -  1 C40a0s2e-:J 1E6L--1M68K4M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t0: 16 6  -f2il e  d   F0i7le/2d8: /0177/ 2  8 P/2a0g1e7ID   . 6 P9a5g9e  :   2P5age 31 of (3391 of 39)\nNos. 16-1684/17-1144  Boler, et al. v. Earley, et al.  Page 25\n \nprospective.โโ  Dubuc v. Mich. Bd. of Law Examโrs, 342 F.3d 610, 616 (6th Cir. 2003) (quoting \nVerizon Md., Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Commโn of Md., 535 U.S. 635, 645 (2002)) (alteration in \noriginal). \na.  Application of Ex Parte Young to Governor Snyder in Boler \nThe  State  Defendants  argue  that  Ex  Parte  Young  is  inapplicable  because  the  Boler \nPlaintiffs  do  not  actually  seek  prospective  injunctive  relief  against  Governor  Snyder,  but \nrestitution,  and  because  they  have  not  shown  any  ongoing  violations  of  federal  law.    The \nPlaintiffs respond that Ex Parte Young applies to the injunctive relief they seek, and that the \nState Defendants, including Governor Snyder, continue to play an active role in the water crisis \nthat is producing ongoing violations of their constitutional rights. \nBut the Boler Complaint does not make clear what those ongoing violations are.  The \nState Defendants posit that the Plaintiffs concede that there is no threat to their ongoing rights by \nacknowledging that Flint has already reconnected to DWSD.  Though we do not find any such \nconcession, the Complaint does appear to be focused on Governor Snyderโs conduct up until \nOctober 2015, when he โbelatedlyโ ordered that the Flint system be reconnected to DWSD. The \nPlaintiffs  allege  that  this  action  was  part  of  his  participation  in  โcreating,  escalating,  and \nprolonging the dangersโ to Flint water consumers, but do not clarify his ongoing involvement \nbeyond that point.  The State Defendants argue that the proposed class focuses on Flint residents \nwho were billed for water between April 2014 and October 2015, suggesting that the conduct at \nissue  took  place  within  that  time  period.    But  many  Complaint  allegations  center  on  the \nPlaintiffsโ obligation to pay for contaminated water, which is ongoing, and allegedly impairs \ntheir constitutional rights under the Contract Clause and Due Process Clause. \nEven if we were to find that the Complaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law, it \nis not clear what injunctive relief is sought.  Though each count alleged requests injunctive relief, \nand the prayer for relief asks for โ[a]ny other relief, including injunctive relief, as [the c]ourt \ndeems fair,โ the Plaintiffs provide no indication as to what this injunctive relief might be.  Under \nour plain reading of the Complaint, the Boler Plaintiffs have not shown that the Ex Parte Young \ndoctrine applies to their claims against Governor Snyder. \n\nCase 5:15-c v  -  1 C40a0s2e-:J 1E6L--1M68K4M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t0: 16 6  -f2il e  d   F0i7le/2d8: /0177/ 2  8 P/2a0g1e7ID   . 6 P9a6g0e  :   2P6age 32 of (3392 of 39)\nNos. 16-1684/17-1144  Boler, et al. v. Earley, et al.  Page 26\n \nb.  Application of Ex Parte Young to Governor Snyder in Mays \nSimilarly, the State Defendants argue that Ex Parte Young does not apply in Mays, \nbecause  the  injunctive  relief  sought  is  not  prospective  or  actually  injunctive,  and  because \ndeclaratory relief is unavailable.  Defendants also argue that the Plaintiffs have not shown any \nongoing violations of their constitutional rights because they have โessentially concede[d] that no \nsuch threat existsโ by acknowledging that Flint has reconnected to DWSD.6 \nBut  this  takes  too  narrow  a  view  of  the  ongoing  constitutional  violations  that  the \nPlaintiffs allege.  Damage to the water pipes has been done, and has ongoing effects.  The \nComplaint specifically refers to Flintโs current State of Emergency, which continues to the \npresent day.  It also alleges that the relief efforts by public officials have been โineffective [and] \noften frivolous[] in mitigating the devastation causedโ by the crisis and such โineffective relief \neffortsโ have themselves prolonged the effects of the crisis.  This is sufficient to show an \nongoing violation of the Plaintiffsโ constitutional rights, especially considering that they bring \nclaims for, among other things, state-created danger and violation of their fundamental right to \nbodily integrity. \nMoreover, the Mays Complaint specifically seeks โ[a]n injunctive order to remediate the \nharm caused by Defendantsโ unconstitutional conduct including, but not limited to: repairs of \nprivate  property  and  establishment  of  medical  monitoring  to  provide  healthcare  and  other \nappropriate services to Class members for a period of time deemed appropriate by the Court.โ  It \nalso seeks the โ[a]ppointment of a monitor who will assist in the development of remedial plans \nincluding, but not limited to: early education, education intervention programs, [and] criminal \nand  juvenile  justice  evaluations.โ    The  State  Defendants  argue  that  this  relief  is  somehow \nโclearlyโ an attempt to obtain โretroactive damages unavailable under Young.โ  But โ[a] court \nmay enter a prospective suit that costs the state money . . . if the monetary impact is ancillary, \ni.e., not the primary purpose of the suit.โ  Barton v. Summers, 293 F.3d 944, 950 (6th Cir. 2002).  \n                                                 \n6\nThe Defendants also argue that the Mays Plaintiffsโ claims against the State of Michigan are barred based \non sovereign immunity.  The only claims asserted against the State of Michigan in Mays are Counts I and II, which \nallege violations of substantive due process and are brought pursuant to ยง 1983.  The Defendants argue that the State \nhas not consented to suit and is not a proper defendant in a cause of action brought under ยง 1983.  The Plaintiffs \nappear to concede this point.  We thus affirm the district courtโs dismissal of the Mays Plaintiffsโ claims against the \nState of Michigan as barred by sovereign immunity. \n\nCase 5:15-c v  -  1 C40a0s2e-:J 1E6L--1M68K4M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t0: 16 6  -f2il e  d   F0i7le/2d8: /0177/ 2  8 P/2a0g1e7ID   . 6 P9a6g1e  :   2P7age 33 of (3393 of 39)\nNos. 16-1684/17-1144  Boler, et al. v. Earley, et al.  Page 27\n \nFor example, the Supreme Court upheld an order enjoining a state to provide education programs \nas a way of redressing past racial discrimination.  See Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 288โ90 \n(1977).  The injunctive order did not award money retroactively, but directed the stateโs conduct \nin the future. \nThat is what the Complaint seeks here: to direct the Governorโs conduct in providing \nservices to Plaintiffs affected by the Flint water crisis.  The primary purpose of this relief is not \nto cost the State of Michigan money, but to provide relief to the Plaintiffs through compensatory \neducation, medical monitoring, and evaluation services.  A straightforward look at the Complaint \nshows that this relief is properly characterized as prospective.  See Verizon, 535 U.S. at 645.  \nThus, we find that Ex Parte Young applies to the claims made against Governor Snyder in Mays. \nIn sum, Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity applies to the State of Michigan in \nboth Mays and Boler, as well as to the Boler Plaintiffsโ claims against the MDEQ, MDHHS, and \nGovernor  Snyder.    The  district  courtโs  dismissal  of  the  Plaintiffsโ  claims  against  these \nDefendants is affirmed.  As noted above, Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity does not \napply to municipalities; thus, the Boler Plaintiffsโ claims against the City DefendantsโEarley \nand Ambrose, former Emergency Managers of Flint; Walling, former Mayor of Flint; and the \nCity of Flintโremain.  Similarly, the Mays Plaintiffsโ claims against all Defendants except the \nState of Michigan remain. \nD.  Dismissal Under Alternate Grounds \nThe Defendants argue that, even if not precluded by the SDWA, the Plaintiffsโ ยง 1983 \nclaims should be dismissed for several alternate reasons.  They argue that the dismissal of both \nBoler and Mays should be affirmed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon \nwhich  relief  can  be  granted.    The  Defendants  also  argue  that  Bolerโs  dismissal  should  be \naffirmed because the claims are merely artfully-pled state law claims, or are based on a recently \nissued EPA administrative order.  Several Defendants in Mays also argue that claims against \nthem should be dismissed based on absolute or qualified immunity, or as impermissibly relying \non the doctrine of respondeat superior.  We do not find any of these arguments availing. \n\nCase 5:15-c v  -  1 C40a0s2e-:J 1E6L--1M68K4M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t0: 16 6  -f2il e  d   F0i7le/2d8: /0177/ 2  8 P/2a0g1e7ID   . 6 P9a6g2e  :   2P8age 34 of (3394 of 39)\nNos. 16-1684/17-1144  Boler, et al. v. Earley, et al.  Page 28\n \n1.  Dismissal Under Rule 12(b)(6) for Failure to State a Claim \nThe Plaintiffs correctly note that the only issues currently before us are the dismissal of \ntheir ยง 1983 claims as preempted by the SDWA and the question of sovereign immunity.  Even \nthough we have determined that the ยง 1983 claims are not foreclosed, the Defendants seek \naffirmance under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  \nWe may affirm the district court on any basis supported in the record.  See Angel v. Kentucky, \n314 F.3d 262, 264 (6th Cir. 2002); see also Blount-Hill v. Zelman, 636 F.3d 278, 284 (6th Cir. \n2011) (affirming the district court on an alternative basis when it โfurther[ed] the interests of \njudicial economy and d[id] not unfairly prejudice the parties, as the issue ha[d] been raised and \nfully briefedโ).  We decline to do so here.  \nFirst, Boler was dismissed pursuant to a Rule 12(b)(1) motion for lack of subject matter \njurisdiction.  Though Mays was apparently dismissed after motions brought under both Rule \n12(b)(1) and (12(b)(6), the district court premised the dismissal on its resolution in Bolerโwhere \nit treated the issue as jurisdictional.  The district court โhas [not] addressed the merits of [the \nPlaintiffsโ] constitutional claims or even the sufficiency of their pleadings.โ  Fitzgerald, 555 U.S. \nat 260.  Nor have the Plaintiffs been given an opportunity to fully brief the merits of their \nconstitutional claims, which involve factual complexities that are best examined by the district \ncourt in the first instance.  Moreover, the Boler and Mays Plaintiffs bring distinct constitutional \nclaims, based on different factual underpinnings and legal arguments.  A consolidated appeal is \nnot the appropriate occasion to evaluate these claims for the first time.  Such an analysis, \nmoreover, could unfairly prejudice the Plaintiffs, who have only addressed the Defendantsโ Rule \n12(b)(6) arguments in their reply briefs.  We believe the district court is in the best position to \nevaluate these arguments upon remand. \n2.  Alternate Grounds for Dismissal of Boler Claims \nThe Defendants also argue that Boler should be dismissed for two additional reasons: \n(1) because the Plaintiffsโ claims are merely artfully-pled state law claims, and (2) based on a \nrecent  EPA  administrative  order.    Neither  argument  merits  affirming  the  district  courtโs \ndismissal. \n\nCase 5:15-c v  -  1 C40a0s2e-:J 1E6L--1M68K4M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t0: 16 6  -f2il e  d   F0i7le/2d8: /0177/ 2  8 P/2a0g1e7ID   . 6 P9a6g3e  :   2P9age 35 of (3395 of 39)\nNos. 16-1684/17-1144  Boler, et al. v. Earley, et al.  Page 29\n \nFirst,  the  district  court  did  not  examine  the  Defendantsโ  argument  that  the  Boler \nPlaintiffsโ ยง 1983 claims are merely artfully-pled state law breach of contract claims.  โDismissal \nfor lack of subject-matter jurisdiction because of the inadequacy of [a] federal claim is proper \nonly  when  the  claim  is  โso  insubstantial,  implausible,  foreclosed  by  prior  [precedent],  or \notherwise completely devoid of merit as not to involve a federal controversy.โโ  Steel Co. v. \nCitizens for a Better Envโt, 523 U.S. 83, 89 (1998) (quoting Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y. v. Cty. \nof Oneida, 414 U.S. 661, 666 (1974)).  That standard is easily overcome here, where the \nPlaintiffs have alleged several substantial constitutional claims sufficient to survive under Rule \n12(b)(1).  Any further evaluation of these claims on the merits, such as their sufficiency under \nRule 12(b)(6), should first be performed by the district court upon remand as discussed above. \nSecond, the Defendants also argue that dismissal of Boler is justified based on the EPAโs \nrecently issued Emergency Administrative Order (EAO), which directed the City of Flint and \nState of Michigan to take certain steps to address the Flint water crisis.  The Defendants assert \nthat the relief requested in Boler would require the district court to review and rule on the EAO, \nbut that exclusive jurisdiction to do so is vested in the court of appeals.  See 42 U.S.C. ยง 300j-\n7(a)(2).  The Plaintiffs do not seek review of or alterations to the EAO, and their claims do not \nconstitute an appeal of a โfinal Agency actionโ by the EPA that would bring the action under the \nambit of the SDWAโs judicial review provision.  Id.  Rather, their claims and the relief they seek \nโmay parallel the EPAโs directives to . . . Flint and Michigan . . . [or] augment those orders.โ  \nConcerned Pastors for Soc. Action v. Khouri, 194 F. Supp. 3d 589, 599 (E.D. Mich. 2016) \n(evaluating and rejecting the same argument made by many of the same Defendants in this \naction).  The EAO does not justify affirming the district courtโs dismissal for lack of subject \nmatter jurisdiction. \n\nCase 5:15-c v  -  1 C40a0s2e-:J 1E6L--1M68K4M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t0: 16 6  -f2il e  d   F0i7le/2d8: /0177/ 2  8 P/2a0g1e7ID   . 6 P9a6g4e  :   3P0age 36 of (3396 of 39)\nNos. 16-1684/17-1144  Boler, et al. v. Earley, et al.  Page 30\n \n3.  Alternate Grounds for Dismissal of Mays Claims \nThe MDEQ Defendants also argue that dismissal of the Mays Plaintiffsโ claims against \nthem should be affirmed on alternate grounds: (1) based on absolute or qualified immunity, or \n(2) as improperly seeking relief based on the doctrine of respondeat superior.  Again, we find \nthat neither argument provides an alternate basis to affirm the district courtโs dismissal.7 \na.  Absolute or Qualified Immunity of MDEQ Officials \nThe MDEQ Defendants argue that the Mays claims against them are barred by absolute \nimmunity,  which  protects  persons  โperforming  adjudicatory  functions  within  a  federal \nagency . . . from damages liability for their judicial acts.โ  Butz v. Economou, 438 U.S. 478, 514 \n(1978).  The shield of absolute immunity has been extended to some officials who โperform \nfunctions closely associated with the judicial process.โ  Cleavinger v. Saxner, 474 U.S. 193, \n200โ01 (1985).  But the Supreme Court has also been โโquite sparing in [its] recognition of \nabsolute  immunity,โ  and  has  declined  โto  extend  it  any  further  than  its  justification  would \nwarrant.โโ  Flying Dog Brewery, LLLP v. Mich. Liquor Control Commโn, 597 F. Appโx 342, 348 \n(6th Cir. 2015) (quoting Burns v. Reed, 500 U.S. 478, 487 (1991)).  As such, officials seeking \nโabsolute exemption from personal liability for unconstitutional conduct must bear the burden of \nshowing that public policy requires an exemption of that scope.โ  Butz, 438 U.S. at 506. \nThe MDEQ Defendants have not done so here.  While they broadly assert that their \nactions โare analogous to those of a prosecutor exercising his prosecutorial discretion to bring \nsuit,โ they provide no case law showing that courts have found MDEQ officials, or public \nofficials making similar decisions to those made by the MDEQ, to be entitled to absolute \nimmunity.    Nor  have  they  provided  an  application of any of the factors we have used to \ndetermine that public officials are entitled to quasi-judicial immunity, such as the need to assure \n                                                 \n7\nWright, the Genesee County Drain Commissioner, also seeks to affirm the district courtโs dismissal of the \nMays Plaintiffsโ claims for failure to plead facts showing that they are entitled to relief against him.  For the reasons \nexplained above, we decline to analyze whether the Plaintiffs have stated a claim against Wright under Rule \n12(b)(6).  But we also note that Wrightโs brief does not make any independent 12(b)(6) arguments and only seeks to \nincorporate his arguments from a motion to dismiss filed before the district court.  We โexplicitly disallow[] the \nincorporation by reference into appellate briefs of documents and pleadings filed in the district court.โ  Northland \nIns. Co. v. Stewart Title Guar. Co., 327 F.3d 448, 453 (6th Cir. 2003).  Such an attempt to incorporate by reference \nโdoes not comply with the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.โ  Id. at 452; see also Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(8). \n\nCase 5:15-c v  -  1 C40a0s2e-:J 1E6L--1M68K4M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t0: 16 6  -f2il e  d   F0i7le/2d8: /0177/ 2  8 P/2a0g1e7ID   . 6 P9a6g5e  :   3P1age 37 of (3397 of 39)\nNos. 16-1684/17-1144  Boler, et al. v. Earley, et al.  Page 31\n \nthat the official can perform his functions without harassment or intimidation or insulation from \npolitical  influence.    See  Flying  Dog  Brewery,  597  F.  Appโx  at  348โ49.    The  Defendantsโ \nconclusory arguments do not merit an extension of the absolute immunity doctrine.  \nThe MDEQ Defendants also argue that the ยง 1983 claims in Mays are barred by qualified \nimmunity.    โQualified  immunity  protects  government  officials  performing  discretionary \nfunctions unless their conduct violates a clearly established statutory or constitutional right of \nwhich a reasonable person in the officialโs position would have known.โ  Silberstein v. City of \nDayton, 440 F.3d 306, 311 (6th Cir. 2006) (citing Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 \n(1982)).  The test for qualified immunity is two-pronged, and the plaintiff must show that the \nofficialโs conduct (1) violated a constitutional right, and (2) that the right was clearly established.  \nSilberstein, 440 F.3d at 311; see also Radvansky v. City of Olmsted Falls, 395 F.3d 291, 302 (6th \nCir.  2005)  (requiring  that  the  plaintiff  establish  that  the  officialโs  action  was  โobjectively \nunreasonable in light of the clearly established constitutional rightsโ). \nThe first part of this test involves determining whether the Mays Plaintiffs have alleged a \nconstitutional violation.  Because we have declined to analyze the merits of the Plaintiffsโ claims, \nwe also decline to determine whether qualified immunity applies in the first instance.  We deny \nthe request to affirm the district courtโs dismissal on the basis of absolute or qualified immunity.  \nb.  Respondeat Superior \nFinally, the MDEQ Defendants argue that the claims in Mays against Wyant, Shekter \nSmith, and Busch are based on the premise that they, as former directors and supervisors within \nthe MDEQ, are liable for โany alleged wrongful conduct of the entire MDEQ/ODWMA/Lansing \nDistrict,  regardless  of  their  level  of  direct  involvement.โ    This,  the  Defendants  assert, \nimpermissibly rests the ยง 1983 claims against them on the doctrine of respondeat superior, or \nsupervisor liability.  See Polk Cty. v. Dodson, 454 U.S. 312, 325 (1981) (โSection 1983 will not \nsupport a claim based on a respondeat superior theory of liability.โ) (citing Monell v. N.Y.C. \nDepโt of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 694 (1978)).  The Plaintiffs respond that their claims against \nthese MDEQ Defendants rest on their own personal conduct. \n\nCase 5:15-c v  -  1 C40a0s2e-:J 1E6L--1M68K4M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t0: 16 6  -f2il e  d   F0i7le/2d8: /0177/ 2  8 P/2a0g1e7ID   . 6 P9a6g6e  :   3P2age 38 of (3398 of 39)\nNos. 16-1684/17-1144  Boler, et al. v. Earley, et al.  Page 32\n \nIndeed, the Mays Complaint specifically alleges that Wyant participated in the decision to \nswitch the City of Flintโs water supply to the KWA.  It alleges that Shekter Smith expressed \nconcern that Flint water would be publicly linked to the outbreak of Legionnaireโs disease, and \nalso acknowledged that the water problems in Flint were due to โcorrosion across the distribution \nsystem.โ  The Complaint alleges that Busch was on notice that the water treatment plant was not \nready at the time Flint switched water supplies, and falsely told the EPA that the City of Flint \nwas using corrosion control on its water supply.  Finally, the Complaint alleges that both Busch \nand Shekter Smith received an EPA report concerning elevated levels of lead in the Flint water \nsupply, and failed to undertake any measures to address the dangers to the public.  These \nallegations concern the individual conduct of the MDEQ Defendants, and their own participation \nin the alleged violations of the Plaintiffsโ substantive due process rights.  They do not rely on \nrespondeat superior, and we deny the request to affirm the district courtโs dismissal on this \nground. \nIII.  CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE the district courtโs dismissal of the Plaintiffsโ \nยง 1983 claims as precluded by the SDWA.  We AFFIRM the dismissal of the Plaintiffsโ claims \nagainst the State of Michigan in Mays, and against the State of Michigan, MDEQ, MDHHS, and \nGovernor  Snyder  in  Boler,  on  the  basis  of  Eleventh  Amendment  sovereign  immunity.  \nWe REMAND the cases for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion. \n\nCase 5:15-cv  -  1  4C0a0s2e-J: E16L--1M6K8M4       E DCoFc uNmo.e 2n0t:1 6  6 f-i3le  d    0F7il/e2d8:/ 1077 / 2  8P/a2g0e1I7D  . 6  9P6a7g e  :  P1age 39 of (3399 of 39)\nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT \n \nNos. 16-1684/17-1144 \n \n \n16-1684 \nBEATRICE BOLER; EDWIN ANDERSON;  \nALLINA ANDERSON; EPCO SALES, LLC, \n  Plaintiffs - Appellants, \n  v. \nDARNELL EARLEY; GERALD AMBROSE;  \nDAYNE WALLING; CITY OF FLINT; STATE  \nOF MICHIGAN; MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT  \nOF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY; MICHIGAN \nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES; \nRICHARD DALE SNYDER, \n  Defendants - Appellees. \n \n17-1144 \nMELISSA MAYS; MICHAEL MAYS;  \nJACQUELINE PEMBERTON; KEITH JOHN \nPEMBERTON; ELNORA CARTHAN; RHONDA KELSO, \n  Plaintiffs - Appellants, \n  v. \nRICK SNYDER; STATE OF MICHIGAN; DANIEL  \nWYANT; LIANE SHEKTER SMITH; ADAM ROSENTHAL; \nSTEPHEN BUSCH; PATRICK COOK; MICHAEL PRYSBY; \nBRADLEY WURFEL; DARNELL EARLEY; GERALD \nAMBROSE; DAYNE WALLING; HOWARD CROFT; \nMICHAEL GLASGOW; DAUGHERTY JOHNSON; \nCITY OF FLINT; NICK LYON; ANDY DILLON;  \nEDWARD KURTZ; JEFF WRIGHT, \n  Defendants - Appellees. \n \n \nBefore:  COLE, Chief Judge; STRANCH and DONALD, Circuit Judges. \n \nJUDGMENT \n \nOn Appeal from the United States District Court \nfor the Eastern District of Michigan at Ann Arbor. \n \n  THIS CAUSE was heard on the record from the district court and was argued by counsel. \n \n  IN CONSIDERATION THEREOF, it is ORDERED that the district courtโs dismissals of the Plaintiffsโ ยง 1983 claims \nas precluded by the Safe Drinking Water Act is REVERSED.

John Corbett OโMeara\nGOVERNOR RICK SNYDER, et al.,\nDefendants.\n_________________________________/\nOPINION AND ORDER\nBefore the court are six motions to dismiss Plaintiffsโ amended complaint\nfiled by Defendants, which have been fully briefed.  For the reasons explained\nbelow, Defendantsโ motions to dismiss are granted.\nBACKGROUND FACTS\nThis case arises out of the contamination of drinking water in Flint,\nMichigan.  Plaintiffs intend to represent a class of Flint residents and others who\nused Flint water from April 25, 2014, to the present.  Defendants are Michigan\nGovernor Rick Snyder, the State of Michigan, Daniel Wyant, Nick Lyon, Andy\nDillon, Liane Shekter Smith, Adam Rosenthal, Stephen Busch, Patrick Cook,\nMichael Prysby, Bradley Wurfel, Jeff Wright, Edward Kurtz, Darnell Earley,\n\nGerald Ambrose, Dayne Walling, Howard Croft, Michael Glasgow, Daugherty\nJohnson, and the City of Flint. \nPlaintiffsโ amended complaint alleges the following causes of action: Count\nI, substantive due process/state created danger, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983; Count II,\nsubstantive due process/bodily integrity, ยง 1983; Count III, equal protection based\nupon race, ยง 1983; Count IV, equal protection based upon wealth, ยง 1983; Count\nV, conspiracy, ยง 1985; and Count VI, violation of the public service provisions of\nthe Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act.  Plaintiffs allege that โDefendants caused a\npublic health crisis by exposing Plaintiffs to contaminated water.โ Amended\nCompl. at ยถ 1.  Defendants have moved to dismiss Plaintiffsโ complaint on various\ngrounds, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and (6).\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\nI. Preclusion of ยง 1983 Claims\nIn Boler v. Earley, No. 16-10323, Docket No. 56 (E.D. Mich., OโMeara, J.),\nanother case involving Flint water contamination, the court concluded that the\nplaintiffsโ constitutional claims brought pursuant to ยง 1983 were precluded by the\nSafe Drinking Water Act (โSDWAโ).  Defendants urge the same result here,\ncontending that if Plaintiffsโ ยง 1983 claims are not viable, Plaintiffs lack a federal\ncause of action and this court should dismiss Plaintiffsโ complaint.\n-2-\n\nIn determining whether a statute precludes suit under ยง 1983, โ[t]he crucial\nconsideration is what Congress intended.โ Smith v. Robinson, 468 U.S. 992, 1012\n(1984).  โWhen the remedial devices provided in a particular Act are sufficiently\ncomprehensive, they may suffice to demonstrate congressional intent to preclude\nthe remedy of suits under ยง 1983.โ Middlesex Cty. Sewerage Authority v. National\nSea Clammers Assn., 453 U.S. 1, 20 (1981).  In Sea Clammers, the Court found\nthat the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) and the Marine Protection,\nResearch, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 (MPRSA), contained comprehensive\nenforcement mechanisms.  The Court held that these enforcement schemes\ndemonstrated Congressโs intent โto supplant any remedy that otherwise would be\navailable under ยง 1983.โ Id. at 21.\nRelying on Sea Clammers, the First Circuit in Matoon v. Pittsfield, 980 F.2d\n1 (1st Cir. 1992), found that the Safe Drinking Water Act precluded other federal\nremedies for unsafe public drinking water.  In Matoon, the plaintiffs were residents\nwho allegedly contracted giardiasis from drinking contaminated water supplied by\nthe City of Pittsfield, Massachusetts.  They alleged a breach of warranty claim, a\nโpublic nuisanceโ claim under federal common law, a claim under 42 U.S.C. ยง\n1983, and a SDWA claim.  \nThe Matoon court found the federal common law nuisance claim to be\n-3-\n\npreempted by the SDWA, because โCongress occupied the field of public drinking\nwater regulation with its enactment of the SDWA.โ Matoon, 980 F.2d at 4. \nQuoting the legislative history, the court noted that the purpose of the SDWA โis to\nassure that water supply systems serving the public meet minimum national\nstandards for protection of public health.โ Id. (citations omitted).  With minor\nexceptions, the SDWA applies โto each public water system in each State.โ  Id. at 4\n(quoting 42 U.S.C. ยง300g).  The SDWA enables the Administrator of the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency to โpublish maximum contaminant level goals\nand promulgate national primary drinking water regulations.โ Id. (quoting 42\nU.S.C. ยง300g-1(b)(1).  After reviewing, the regulatory scheme, the First Circuit\nconcluded that โthe SDWA evinces a clear congressional intent to entrust the\nregulation of the public drinking water systems to an expert regulatory agency\nrather than the courts.โ Matoon, 980 F.2d at 4-5.  The court determined that, as a\nresult, the federal common law nuisance claim was preempted by the SDWA.\nThe Matoon court further determined that the plaintiffsโ ยง 1983 claims were\nprecluded by the SDWA as well.  The court noted the โelaborate enforcement\nschemeโ set forth in the SDWA, including that the EPA Administrator may bring a\ncivil action to compel SDWA compliance and may issue compliance orders against\nviolators of SDWA regulations.  Id. at 5-6 (citing 42 U.S.C. ยง 300g-3(b) and ยง\n-4-\n\n300g-3(b)(1)).  In addition, citizens may initiate enforcement proceedings against\nSDWA violators and against the EPA Administrator for failure to perform any\nnon-discretionary duty under the SDWA.  See id.; 42 U.S.C. ยง 300j-8. \nAs the court explained, because โthe SDWA enforcement scheme is closely\nanalogous to other enforcement schemes found sufficiently comprehensive to\nevince a clear congressional intent to preempt relief under section 1983, we hold\nthat appellantsโ section 1983 claims are preempted by the SDWA.โ Matoon, 980\nF.2d at 6.  โComprehensive federal statutory schemes, such as the SDWA, preclude\nrights of action under section 1983 for alleged deprivations of constitutional rights\nin the field occupied by the federal statutory scheme.โ Id.  See also Sea Clammers,\n453 U.S. at 21 (FWPCA and MPRSA supplant remedies under ยง 1983); City of\nRancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, 544 U.S. 113 (2005) (remedial scheme in\nTelecommunications Act precludes ยง 1983 action);  Smith v. Robinson, 468 U.S.\n992 (1984) (Education of Handicapped Act provides exclusive remedy even when\nplaintiffs assert constitutional claims); Zombro v. Baltimore City Police Dept., 868\nF.2d 1364 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 850 (1989) (ADEA, not ยง 1983, is\nexclusive remedy for age discrimination claims under federal law).\nThe essence of Plaintiffsโ constitutional claims is that Plaintiffs were injured\nas a result of exposure to contaminated water.  See Amended Compl. at ยถยถ 122,\n-5-\n\n138, 146, 154, 170, 186.  Plaintiffsโ allegations are addressed by regulations that\nhave been promulgated by the EPA under the SDWA. See, e.g., 40 C.F.R. ยง 141.11\n(regulating maximum contaminant levels); 40 C.F.R. ยง 141.31 et seq. (reporting\nand record keeping); 40 C.F.R. ยง 141.60 et seq. (maximum contaminant and\nresidual disinfectant levels); 40 C.F.R. ยง 141.80 et seq. (control of lead and\ncopper/corrosion control/lead service line replacement requirements); 40 C.F.R. ยง\n141.110 (regulating treatment techniques).  Indeed, the safety of public water\nsystems is a field occupied by the SDWA.  Matoon, 980 F.2d at 4.  Accordingly,\nconsistent with its decision in Boler, the court concludes that Plaintiffsโ federal\nremedy is under the SDWA, regardless of how their legal theories are characterized\nin the complaint. \nPlaintiffs argue that their ยง 1983 claims are not precluded, relying on\nCharvat v. Eastern Ohio Regional Wastewater Authority, 246 F.3d 607 (6th Cir.\n2001) and Fitzgerald v. Barnstable School Comm., 555 U.S. 246 (2009).  Charvat\nand Fitzgerald are distinguishable, however.  In Fitzgerald, the Supreme Court\ndetermined that Title IX did not preclude an equal protection claim alleging\nunconstitutional gender discrimination in schools.  The Court found that, unlike the\nstatutes at issue in Sea Clammers, Smith, and Rancho Palos Verdes, Title IX did\nnot provide a carefully tailored private enforcement mechanism.  The Court noted\n-6-\n\nthat Title IXโs remedies (withdrawal of federal funds and an implied cause of\naction) โstand in stark contract to the โunusually elaborate,โ โcarefully tailored,โ\nand โrestrictiveโ enforcement schemes of the statutes at issue in Sea Clammers,\nSmith, and Rancho Palos Verdes.โ Fitzgerald, 555 U.S. at 255.  Like those statutes,\nand unlike Title IX, the SDWA โestablishes an elaborate enforcement schemeโ\nwith respect to safe drinking water.  Allowing parallel ยง 1983 claims to proceed\nwould โcircumventโ the SDWAโs procedures and would be โinconsistent with\nCongressโ carefully tailored scheme.โ Id. at 254-55 (citation omitted).\nIn Charvat, the Sixth Circuit concluded that the SDWAโs whistleblower\nprovisions did not preclude the plaintiff from bringing suit under ยง 1983 for a First\nAmendment violation.  The whistleblower provisions of the SDWA, however, do\nnot contain the same โelaborate enforcement schemeโ as the substantive provisions\nof the statute.  Rather, the whistleblower provisions provide for an administrative\nremedy, which โis not necessarily sufficient to demonstrate Congress intended to\nforeclose a ยง 1983 remedy.โ Charvat, 246 F.3d at 614-15 (citation omitted).\nThe court is mindful that it is not to โlightly conclude that Congress intended\nto preclude reliance on ยง 1983 as a remedy for a substantial equal protection\nclaim.โ Smith, 468 U.S. at 1012.  The elaborate enforcement scheme of the\nSDWA, however, leads it to conclude that ยง 1983 claims seeking to remedy unsafe\n-7-\n\ndrinking water would be โinconsistent with Congressโ carefully tailored scheme.โ\nId.  See also Hildebrand v. Allegheny Cty., 757 F.3d 99, (3d Cir. 2014) (โThe\nSupreme Court has consistently indicated that the comprehensiveness of a statuteโs\nremedial scheme is the primary factor in determining congressional intent.โ).  \nWithout viable constitutional claims, Plaintiffsโ conspiracy claim under ยง\n1985(3) based upon the same conduct also fails.  See Beztak Land Co. v. City of\nDetroit, 298 F.3d 559, 568-69 (6th Cir. 2002).  The court will dismiss Plaintiffsโ\nclaims under ยงยง 1983 and 1985.\nII. ELCRA Claim\nThe court will decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiffsโ\nremaining claim, which arises under Michiganโs Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act. \nGenerally, โif the federal claims are dismissed before trial, . . . the state claims\nshould be dismissed as well.โ  Taylor v. First of Am. Bank-Wayne, 973 F.2d 1284,\n1287 (6th Cir. 1992) (quoting United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 726\n(1966)).\n-8-\n\nORDER\nAccordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Defendantsโ motions to\ndismiss are GRANTED and Plaintiffsโ complaint is DISMISSED.\ns/John Corbett OโMeara \nUnited States District Judge\nDate:  February 2, 2017\nI hereby certify that a copy of the foregoing document was served upon\ncounsel of record on this date, February 2, 2017, using the ECF system.\ns/William Barkholz \nCase Manager\n-9-",
