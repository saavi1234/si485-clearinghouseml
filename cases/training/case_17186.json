    "summary": "<p>On February 18, 2016, a group of Flint, Michigan residents filed this class action lawsuit in the Michigan Circuit Court for the County of Genesee. The plaintiffs sued Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, P.C. and a related corporate entity under state law. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs alleged that Lockwood, a company that helped Flint switch its water source from Lake Huron to the Flint River, negligently caused Flint residents to be supplied with water contaminated by lead and other biological and chemical agents and failed to warn residents about the health risks. The plaintiffs claimed that they sustained serious bodily injury, property damage, depreciation of property value, and emotional harm and resulting stress-related physical symptoms as a result. The plaintiffs sought compensatory damages and attorney’s fees. </p><p>The defendants removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan on February 23, 2016, which the plaintiffs opposed. </p><p>On May 11, 2016, the district court (Judge John Corbett O’Meara) remanded the case to state court. In Judge O’Meara’s view, the dispute was “a truly local controversy” ill-suited to a federal forum. Judge O’Meara noted that the plaintiffs’ negligence claims did not involve a substantial federal question and that the Class Action Fairness Act (CAFA) could not support federal jurisdiction because CAFA’s local controversy exception applied: there was a significant local defendant, more than two-thirds of the proposed class were Michiganders, the injuries happened in Michigan, and there was no similar class action against any of the defendants. </p><p>The defendants appealed. On November 16, 2016, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the district court’s decision. Judge Richard A. Griffin (joined by Judge Bernice B. Donald) wrote that the case “exemplifies the quintessential local controversy” and found that CAFA’s local controversy exception applied. Judge Raymond M. Kethledge dissented, arguing that the plaintiffs failed to adduce sufficient proof that at least two-thirds of the members of the putative class were Michiganders or that the conduct of a Michigan defendant formed a significant basis for the claim. </p><p>The case is now ongoing in Michigan state court. As of November 19, 2019, the parties are engaged in discovery.  </p><p></p>",

This lawsuit is brought as a proposed class action against Lockwood, Andrews &\nNewnam,P C. and Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, Inc., for professional negligence in\nconnection with their participation in the plan to use the Flint River as a primary source for\ndrinking water in the City of Flint. As a direct and proximate result of Defendants' breaches, the\nresidents oft he City of Flint (\"Flint\"), from April 25, 2014 to the present, have experienced and\nwill continue to experience serious personal injury and property damage.\n2.  Plaintiffs' representatives are, and at all relevant times were, residents of the City\nof Flint, Michigan, who, as individuals, parents and minors and as property owners, have been\nand continue to be exposed to highly dangerous conditions created and caused by Defendants'\nnegligent administration of a plan to place the Flint Water Plant into operation using the Flint\nRiver as a primary source.\n3.  Defendant Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam,P C. is a Michigan professional\ncorporation with its principal place of business in Genesee County, Michigan and Defendant\nLockwood, Andrews & Newnam,I nc. is a Texas professional corporation doing business in\nGenesee County, Michigan. For all intents and purposes both entities were involved in the\nactivities described below and therefore shall be collectively referred to herein as \"LAN.\"\n4.  The amount in dispute is in excess of $25,000.00, exclusive of costs and attorney\nfees and all of the parties have, upon information and belief, personally transacted business in\nGenesee County, Michigan, such that jurisdiction and venue are properly with this Court.\nCLASS ALLEGATIONS\n5.  This action is brought by the named Plaintiffs on behalf of individuals who, as\nindividuals, parents and minors and as property owners, have been and continue to be exposed to\n2\n\n2:16-cv-10663-MOB-EAS   Doc # 1-1   Filed 02/23/16   Pg 8 of 39    Pg ID 35\nhighly dangerous conditions created and caused by Defendant's negligent administration of a\nplan to place the Flint Water Plant into operation using the Flint River as a primary source.\n6.  The number of injured individuals who have been exposed to and injured by the\nhighly dangerous conditions (described more thoroughly below) is in the tens of thousands. The\nnumber of class members is sufficiently numerous to make class action status the most practical\nmethod for Plaintiffs to secure redress for injuries sustained and class wide equitable relief.\n7.  There are questions of law and fact raised by the named Plaintiffs' claims\ncommon to, and typical of, those raised by the Class they seek to represent.\n8.  The violations ofl aw and resulting harms alleged by the named Plaintiffs are\ntypical of the legal violations and harmed suffered by all Class members.\n9.  Plaintiff Class representatives will fairly and adequately protect the interest of the\nPlaintiff class members. Plaintiffs' counsel are unaware of any conflicts ofi nterest between the\nclass representatives and absent class members with respect to the matters at issue in this\nlitigation; the class representatives will vigorously prosecute the suit on behalf of the Class; and\nthe class representatives are represented by experienced counsel.\n10.  Plaintiffs are represented by attorneys with substantial experience and expertise in\ncomplex and class action litigation involving engineering firms and the duty of care.\n11.  Plaintiffs' attorneys have identified and thoroughly investigated all claims in this\naction, and have committed sufficient resources to represent the Class.\n12.  The maintenance of the action as a class action will be superior to other available\nmethods of adjudication and will promote the convenient administration ofj ustice. Moreover,\nthe prosecution of separate actions by individual members oft he Class could result in\ninconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members oft he Class.\n3\n\n2:16-cv-10663-MOB-EAS   Doc # 1-1   Filed 02/23/16   Pg 9 of 39    Pg ID 36\n13.  Defendants have acted or failed to act on grounds generally applicable to all\nPlaintiffs, necessitating legal relief for the Class, including but not limited to an award of\ndamages to fully compensate the Class for all oft he damages it has sustained past, present and\nfuture.\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\n14.  From 1964 to 2014, Flint water users received their water from Lake Huron via\nthe Detroit Water and Sewerage Department( \"DWSD\").\n15.  During this 50 year span, the Flint water users enjoyed safe, clean, fresh water in\ntheir homes, businesses, hospitals and other places of public services.\n16.  In 2011, Flint government officials commissioned a study by LAN to determine if\nthe Flint River could be safely used by the city as the primary source of drinking water for its\nmore than 31,000 users. A report of the study, entitled Analysis oft he Flint River as a\nPermanent Water Supplyf or the City ofF lint( the \"2011 Report\"), was published in July, 2011.\n17.  The July 2011 LAN report stated that the water from the Flint River was highly\ncorrosive and could not be used safely without an anti-corrosive agent to prevent lead, copper\nand other heavy metals from leaching into the water from the lead, copper and iron-based water\nlines.\n18.  In early 2013, City of Flint Emergency Manager Ed Kurtz signed an agreement to\nswitch Flint's primary drinking water source from the DSWD water source to a newly formed\nKaregondi Water Authority( \"KWA\"), which was scheduled to become operational sometime in\n2016.\n19.  In June of 2013, Mr. Kurtz authorized action to prepare the Flint Water Treatment\nPlant( \"FWTP\")i n anticipation of using the Flint water as the primary water source.\n4\n\n2:16-cv-10663-MOB-EAS   Doc # 1-1   Filed 02/23/16   Pg 10 of 39    Pg ID 37\n20.  On June 26, 2013, Kurtz signed a Resolution authorizing Flint City Officials to\nenter into a Professional Services contract with LAN for the administration of placing the Flint\nWater Plant into operation using the Flint River as a primary source.\n21.  Shortly thereafter, LAN did enter into a Professional Services contract for the\nadministration of placing the Flint Water Plant into operation using the Flint River as a primary\nsource, and LAN is designated as the Design Engineer on the City of Flint's application for a\npermit for placing the Flint Water Plant into operation using the Flint River as a primary source.\n22.  Because it had prepared the 2011 report regarding Flint River water, LAN was\nwell aware that without a proper anti-corrosive treatment using the Flint River as a primary\nsource of drinking water would create a condition dangerous to health and property.\n23.  Contrary to water quality standards and common sense, LAN failed to evaluate\nthe quality of the Flint River water as it came out of the consumers' tap before substituting high\nquality Detroit water with questionable quality Flint River water.\n24.  LAN was fully aware that, as a consequence of the failure to use the required and\nnecessary anti-corrosive agent in the Flint River water, the Plaintiffs and the entire Plaintiff Class\nwere being exposed to toxic levels of lead and other metals and chemicals.\n25.  The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality( \"MDEQ\")p romulgated\nrules that required Flint to conduct two six-month rounds of testing for lead and copper (July-\nDecember 2014 and January-June 2015) in homes that were identified as \"Tier 1\" sample sites\n(sites with known lead plumbing and/or service lines), for the presence of lead or other heavy\nmetals.\n26.  Notwithstanding the MDEQ lead testing rules, corrosion control chemicals should\nhave been used immediately in connection with placing the Flint Water Plant into operation\n5\n\n2:16-cv-10663-MOB-EAS   Doc # 1-1   Filed 02/23/16   Pg 11 of 39    Pg ID 38\nusing the Flint River as a primary source, as corroborated by the December 2015 \"Auditor's\nReport,\" which expressly criticized the MDEQ because it did not confer with or obtain the\napproval of the EPA when it decided to delay the use of corrosion control chemicals until after\nthe two rounds of monitoring tests.\n27.  The Auditor's Report also established that in accordance with the Federal Safe\nDrinking Water Lead and Copper Rule( \"LCR\"), all large public water systems, in particular and\nspecifically that of Flint, are required to install and maintain corrosion control treatment for lead\nand copper water service systems.\n28.  In the absence of corrosion control treatment, lead levels in the water coming\nfrom lead and copper based water systems will rise to unacceptable levels.\n29.  In connection with its administration of placing the Flint Water Plant into operation\nusing the Flint River as a primary source, LAN failed to demand or ensure the use of corrosion\ncontrol treatment chemicals even though the LCR required these actions so as to ensure lead free\ndrinking water.\n30.  The Auditor's Report also confirmed that the results of the first round of water\nsampling tests disclosed lead levels in excess of the minimal action levels, i.e. 5 parts per billion\n(\"PPb\").\n31.  A Michigan Department of Health and Human services( \"DHHS\")r eport on the\nBlood Lead Level Test Results for children 6 years and younger living in Flint Zip Codes 48501-\n48507, showed a significant and dangerous spike in the blood lead levels during the second and\nthird quarter on 2014.\n32.  In the summer of 2014, the Flint area experienced a spike in Legionnaires'\nDisease that resulted in 10 deaths in 18 months.\n6\n\n2:16-cv-10663-MOB-EAS   Doc # 1-1   Filed 02/23/16   Pg 12 of 39    Pg ID 39\n33.  Within days after the April 25, 2014 switch, Flint Defendants began receiving\ncomplaints from water users, including some or all of the Plaintiffs herein, that the water was\ncloudy and discolored in appearance and foul in taste and odor.\n34.  Within weeks after the April 25, 2014 switch, water users, including some or all\nof the Plaintiffs herein, were reporting to the Flint authorities that they were experiencing hair\nloss, rashes, vomiting and other physical maladies.\n35.  Flint water users, having enjoyed decades of safe, clean and fresh water via the\nDetroit water system, knew almost immediately after the switch to Flint River water that\nsomething was not right about this new water supply.\n36.  By August of 2014, Flint water tested positive for E. coli. and several \"boil water\"\nadvisories were issued by the City of Flint through September of 2014.\n37.  During the next eight( 8) months, Flint water users expressed their concerns about\nwater quality in multiple ways, including letters, e-mails and telephone calls to Flint and MDEQ\nofficials, the media and through well publicized demonstrations on the streets of Flint.\n38.  In August of 2014, Flint violated the National Primary Drinking Water\nRegulations Maximum Contaminant Level( \"MCL\")f or E. Coli bacteria.\n39.  In September 2014, Flint again violated the National Primary Drinking Water\nRegulations for MCL.\n40.  In November of 2014, LAN was on actual notice of the need to assess the factors\ncontributing to high Trihalomethane( \"THHM\")l evels following the water source change.\n41.  Beginning almost immediately after the Flint River became the primary source of\nwater for the Flint users, the MDEQ and Flint officials were aware of elevated and unlawful\nlevels of Trihalomethanes( \"TTHM\").\n7\n\n2:16-cv-10663-MOB-EAS   Doc # 1-1   Filed 02/23/16   Pg 13 of 39    Pg ID 40\n42.  After about 7 months of elevated TTHM levels, Flint water users belatedly\nreceived a notice in January 2015 from the City of Flint stating that the water was not in\ncompliance with the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act because unlawful levels of TTHMs.\n43.  In late 2014 or early 2015, a dramatic spike in elevated blood lead levels in Flint's\nyoungest children in the third quarter of 2014 was identified by the Michigan Department of\nHealth and Human Services( \"MDHHS\").\n44.  This aforementioned spike meant that by the third quarter of 2014, the percent of\nFlint children with known elevated blood lead level tests rose from 2.5% to about 7%.\n45.  This upward spike coincided precisely with the exposure of Flint's children to the\ntoxic water of the Flint River, in their homes, schools and other public locations.\n46.  That the aforementioned spike occurred at the time of the exposure to the Flint\nRiver water, constituted clear arid certain notice that a major health emergency confronted the\nchildren of Flint.\n47.  In the summer of 2014, a dramatic spike in.L egionnaires' disease occurred in\nFlint that resulted in 10 deaths in 18 months.\n48.  That the aforementioned spike occurred at the time of the exposure to the Flint\nRiver water and constituted clear and certain notice that a major health emergency confronted the\nchildren of Flint.\n49.  On or about August of 2015, Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, a pediatrician from Hurley\nHospital in Flint, produced a similar study showing a similar spike in elevated blood lead levels\nfor the children of Flint.\n50.  Another example of the irrefutable nature of the evidence that the water was unfit\nfor human exposure and consumption was the highly publicized media report in October 2014\n8\n\n2:16-cv-10663-MOB-EAS   Doc # 1-1   Filed 02/23/16   Pg 14 of 39    Pg ID 41\nthat General Motors refused to continue using Flint River water in its manufacturing facilities\ndue to the highly corrosive nature of the water that was ruining its parts and production\nmachinery.\n51.  On or about May 6, 2015, employees from EPA Region 5 arrived in Flint and\nbegan sampling the water for elevated lead levels, which disclosed dangerously high lead levels.\n52.  The EPA also found lead levels from the Flint River twice that required in order\nto classify as hazardous waste.\n53.  On or about June 24, 2015, EPA representative Miguel Del Toral wrote a detailed\nmemo entitled \"High Lead Levels in Flint, Michigan-Interim Report,\" outlining numerous\ndangers and hazards associated with the water being pumped from the Flint River, including\nunacceptable levels of lead.\n54.  According to Mr. Del Toral's memo, because Flint has failed to use the same\nchemical treatments for lead and copper after it made the switch in 2014, corroded plumbing was\nlikely leaching lead (\"In the absence of any corrosion control treatment, lead levels in drinking\nwater can be expected to increase.\")\n55.  During the spring and summer of 2015, Professor Marc Edwards (\"Professor\nEdwards\") and other experts from Virginia Tech tested 277 drinking water samples in Flint and\nfound that 10% of the samples had lead levels of 25 parts per billion (ppb), substantially in\nexcess of the federal action level of 15 ppb.\n56.  Professor Edwards was quoted as saying \"I have never in my 25-year career seen\nsuch outrageously high levels going into another home in the United States.\"\n57.  Professor Edwards also determined that the Flint River water was 19 times more\ncorrosive than the water pumped from Lake Huron by the Detroit water system and that without\n9\n\n2:16-cv-10663-MOB-EAS   Doc # 1-1   Filed 02/23/16   Pg 15 of 39    Pg ID 42\ncorrosion control treatment, lead was leaching out from the lead based service lines at alarming\nrates.\n58.  On or about September 2, 2015, Professor Edwards published the results of his\nstudies described above.\n59.  In addition, Dr. Hanna-Attisha of Hurley Hospital demonstrated and publicly\ndisclosed a dramatic and dangerous spike in elevated blood lead levels in a large cohort of Flint\nchildren corresponding with the time of exposure to the highly corrosive Flint River water. Her\ndisturbing results were published in August 2015.\n60.  Also on September 29, 2015, the Genesee County Health Department issued a\n\"Public Health Advisory for People Using the Flint City Water Supply with the Flint River as the\nSource,\"( \"Advisory\"), which stated in pertinent part: \"recent data provided by Hurley Hospital\nResearchers has indicated that a significant increase in blood lead levels has occurred in children\nsince the switch to Flint River water. The County Health Officer has requested that the\nMichigan Department of Health and Human Services( MDHSS)p rovide the County specific data\nto support its claim that state data is more comprehensive and does not show a significant\nincrease.\n61.  On or about October 8, 2015, Flint's Eisenhower and Freeman Elementary\nSchools, along with Brownell/Holmes STEM Academies exceeded 15 ppb for lead -- the safety\nstandard set by the federal government. Students and staff were ordered to drink bottled water\nonly.\n62.  Among the other serious harm caused by the conduct alleged herein, the\nprolonged exposure of the highly corrosive water without adequate anti-corrosive agents has\n10\n\n2:16-cv-10663-MOB-EAS   Doc # 1-1   Filed 02/23/16   Pg 16 of 39    Pg ID 43\nirreparably damaged the approximately 15,000 sets of lead and copper plumbing throughout the\nCity of Flint, all of which must now be replaced.\nPROFESSIONAL NEGLIGENCE\n63.  Plaintiffs incorporate the preceding paragraphs as though fully stated herein.\n64.  LAN owed a duty to Plaintiffs, as residents and property owners in the City of\nFlint, to exercise that degree of care consistent with the greater degree of knowledge and skill\npossessed by design professionals, as well as an ethical duty to report to public authorities the\ndangers posed to public health and property that would result from the failure to install a proper\nanti-corrosive treatment when using the Flint River as a primary source of drinking.\n65.  LAN also owed a duty to Plaintiffs to notify the proper authorities of unethical or\nillegal practices of others whose actions or decisions posed threats to public health and property\nthat would result from the failure to install a proper anti-corrosive treatment when using the Flint\nRiver as a primary source of drinking.\n66.  Plaintiffs had a right to and did rely upon LAN's professional expertise and\nethical obligations in connection with LAN's administration of placing the Flint Water Plant into\noperation using the Flint River as a primary source.\n67.  LAN's duties to Plaintiffs included, but were not limited to, the duty to properly\nadminister the placing the Flint Water Plant into operation using the Flint River as a primary\nsource in such a manner that this would not endanger the health and property of Plaintiffs, and\ntake other actions consistent with the greater degree of knowledge and skill possessed by design\nprofessionals, and the duty to report to public authorities the dangers posed to public health and\nproperty that would result from the failure to install a proper anti-corrosive treatment when using\nthe Flint River as a primary source of drinking.\n11\n\n2:16-cv-10663-MOB-EAS   Doc # 1-1   Filed 02/23/16   Pg 17 of 39    Pg ID 44\n68.  As a direct result of LAN so negligently and carelessly administering the placing\nof the Flint Water Plant into operation using the Flint River as a primary source and failing to\nreport to public authorities the dangers posed to public health and property that would result\nfrom the failure to install a proper anti-corrosive treatment when using the Flint River as a\nprimary source of drinking, Plaintiffs and Plaintiff Class members have experienced serious and\nin some cases life threatening and irreversible bodily injury.\n69.  Plaintiffs and Plaintiff Class members have and will also incur substantial\neconomic losses in the nature of medical expenses and lost wages.\n70.  Plaintiffs and Plaintiff Class members are also entitled to an award of non-\neconomic damages in the nature of pain and suffering, embarrassment, outrage, mental anguish,\nfear and mortification, and stress related physical symptoms such as sleepiness, gastro-intestinal\ndiscomfort, neuropathy and similar symptoms.\n71.  Finally, Plaintiffs and Plaintiff Class members have experienced property damage\nto the homes and places of business in the nature of lost property value and seek damages to\nremediate the permanent damage caused by the use of corrosive water without proper anti-\ncorrosive treatment.\nRELIEF REQUESTED\nAccordingly, Plaintiffs request the following relief from the court:\na.  An order certifying this case as a Class Action;\nb. An order for an award of full compensatory damages for those injuries and\ndamages, including diminution of the value of property values, sustained by class\nrepresentatives and all class members;\nc.

This action is brought by the named Plaintiffs on behalf oft he Class who have been\nand continue to be exposed to highly dangerous conditions created and caused by Defendants'\nnegligent and/or reckless administration of a plan to place the FWTP into full-time operation using\nthe Flint River as the primary water source, and reckless disregard of the safety and health of the\ncitizens of Flint as well as its own professional duties and obligations.\n8.  The number of injured individuals who have been exposed to and injured by the\nhighly dangerous conditions (described more thoroughly throughout this pleading) is in the tens\nof thousands. The number of Class Members is sufficiently numerous to make class action the\nmost practical method for Plaintiffs to secure redress for injuries sustained by the Class Members.\n3\n\n2:16-cv-10663-MOB-EAS   Doc # 1-1   Filed 02/23/16   Pg 24 of 39    Pg ID 51\n9.  There are questions of law and fact raised by the claims set forth herein that are\ncommon to, and typical of, those raised by the Class Members that Plaintiffs seek to represent.\n10.  The violations ofl aw and resulting harms alleged by the named Plaintiffs are typical\nof the legal violations and harms suffered by all Class Members.\n11.  Plaintiff Class Representatives will fairly and adequately protect the interest of the\nPlaintiff Class Members. Plaintiffs' counsel are unaware of any conflicts of interest between the\nPlaintiff Class Representatives and absent Class Members with respect to the matters at issue in\nthis litigation; the Plaintiff Class Representatives will vigorously prosecute the suit on behalf of\nthe entire Class; and the Plaintiffs are represented by experienced counsel.\n12.  Plaintiffs are represented by attorneys with substantial experience and expertise in\ncomplex and class action litigation involving engineering firms and the duty of care.\n13.  Plaintiffs' attorneys have identified and thoroughly investigated all claims in this\naction, and have committed sufficient resources to represent the Class.\n14.  The maintenance of the action as a class action will be superior to other available\nmethods of adjudication and will promote the convenient administration ofj ustice. Moreover,t he\nprosecution of separate actions by individual members of the Class could result in inconsistent or\nvarying adjudications with respect to individual members of the Class.\n15.  Defendants has acted or failed to act on grounds generally applicable to all\nPlaintiffs, necessitating legal relief for the Class, including but not limited to an award of damages\nto fully compensate the Class for all of the damages it has sustained past, present and future.\n4\n\n2:16-cv-10663-MOB-EAS   Doc # 1-1   Filed 02/23/16   Pg 25 of 39    Pg ID 52\nGENERAL ALLEGATIONS\n16.  The Flint River supplied Flint's drinking water for approximately 50 years until\n1964.\n17.  As early as 1964, the US Geological Survey noted high levels of chloride in the\nFlint River.\n18.  From 1964 to 2014, Flint water users received their water from Lake Huron via the\nDetroit Water and Sewerage Department( \"DWSD\").\n19.  During this 50-year span, the Flint water users enjoyed safe, clean, fresh water in\ntheir homes, businesses, hospitals and other places of public services.\n20.  A 2001 report by the Department ofN atural Resources noted that certain businesses\nalong the Flint River had permits to discharge runofff rom industrial and mining activities as well\nas petroleum and gasoline cleanups.\n21.  In 2004, a technical assessment of the Flint River raised concerns about using the\nriver as a source of drinking water. One of the key points from the \"Source Water Assessment\nReport for the City of Flint Water Supply — Flint River Emergency Intake, prepared by the U.S.\nGeological Survey, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality( \"MDEQ\")a nd the Flint\nWater Utilities Department, was that the Flint River was a very highly sensitive drinking water\nsource that was susceptible to contamination.\n22.  In 2011, Flint government officials commissioned a study (or studies) by LAN to\ndetermine if the Flint River could be safely used by the city as the primary source of drinking water\nfor its more than 31,000 residents and users. One of those studies, entitled \"Analysis oft he Flint\nRiver as a Permanent Water Supplyf or the City ofF lint\"( the \"2011 Report\"), which bore LAN's\nlogo, was published in July of 2011.\n5\n\n2:16-cv-10663-MOB-EAS   Doc # 1-1   Filed 02/23/16   Pg 26 of 39    Pg ID 53\n23.  Upon information and belief, this 2011 Report indicated that the water from the\nFlint River was highly corrosive and could not be used safely without an anti-corrosive agent to\nprevent lead, copper and other heavy metals from leaching into the water from the lead, copper\nand iron-based water lines.\n24.  In early 2013, City of Flint Emergency Manager Ed Kurtz( who was appointed to\nthat position in or around August of2 012)s igned an agreement to switch Flint's primary drinking\nwater source from the DWSD to the newly formed Karegnondi Water Authority( \"KWA\"), which\nwas scheduled to become operational sometime in 2016. Upon information and belief, Flint\nassumed it would continue to purchase its water from DWSD until the KWA became operational\nin 2016.\n25.  DWSD protested Flint joining the KWA and attempted to convince Flint to\nreconsider switching over to the KWA and continue purchasing its water from the DWSD. Flint\ndeclined. In April of 2013, DWSD gave Flint notice that their long-standing water agreement\nwould terminate in April of 2014.\n26.  On or about June 26, 2013, Mr. Kurtz signed a resolution authorizing Flint to enter\ninto a professional services contract with LAN for the administration of placing the FWTP into\nfull-time operational use, which would draw water from the Flint River as its primary source of\nwater until the completion of the KWA.\n27.  Flint formally retained LAN as the design engineer for improvements and upgrades\nto the FWTP, which would ultimately enable the FWTP to operate full-time and provide proper\ntreatment to the water drawn from the Flint River.\n28.  Upon information and belief, there were no bids submitted by LAN or any other\nfirm for this work, nor were any other firms considered for this work.\n6\n\n2:16-cv-10663-MOB-EAS   Doc # 1-1   Filed 02/23/16   Pg 27 of 39    Pg ID 54\n29.  On June 29, 2013, LAN met with representatives of Flint, representatives of the\nGenesee County Drain Commissioners Office and the MDEQ to discuss:\na.  using the Flint River as a water source;\nb.  the ability to perform the necessary upgrades to the FWTP;\nc.  the ability to perform quality control;\nd.  the ability for Flint to provide water to Genesee County;\ne.  the ability to meet an April or May 2014 timeline; and\nf.  developing a cost analysis.\n30.  According to incomplete meeting minutes,\" the conversation was guided with focus\non engineering, regulatory, and quality aspects . . .\" of the items previously referenced, and the\nfollowing determinations were made:\na.  the Flint River would be more difficult to treat, but was viable as a source;\nb.  it was possible to engineer and construct the upgrades needed for the\ntreatment process;\nc.  it was possible to perform quality control \"with support from LAN\nengineering which works with several water systems around the state,\nquality control could be addressed[;]\"\nd.  FWTP did not have the capacity to treat and distribute sufficient water to\nmeet the needs of Flint and Genesee County;\ne.  there were many obstacles to overcome, but completion by the April or May\n2014 timeline was reachable; and\nf.  the next steps were for LAN to present Flint with a proposal that would\ninclude engineering, procurement, and construction needs for the project\nalong with cost estimates.\n31.  Upgrading the FWTP would have its challenges. Since 1965, the FWTP served as\na secondary and backup water supply system to the DWSD. Typically, a secondary supply for a\npublic water system is expected to be needed only during emergency situations, and is normally\ndesigned for short term operation such as providing the average daily demand for only a few days.\n7\n\n2:16-cv-10663-MOB-EAS   Doc # 1-1   Filed 02/23/16   Pg 28 of 39    Pg ID 55\n32.  Upon information and belief, the FWTP was previously upgraded in or around 2004\nin order to allow it to operate for an extended short-term period (i.e., approximately 6 weeks)\nbecause of a perceived high risk that the DWSD supply would fail and remain out of service for\nan extended duration.\n33.  Due to the aforementioned 2013 agreement,t he FWTP needed to be upgraded again\nto operate on a full-time basis, otherwise it would be unable to provide the citizens of Flint with\nsufficient quantities of water.\n34.  In April of 2014, LAN, Flint and DEQ officials addressed and discussed\noptimization for lead, and it was determined that having more data was advisable before\nimplementing an optimization method.\n35.  LAN knew,i f not recommended, that the FWTP would begin drawing water from\nthe Flint River later that month that would not be treated with anti-corrosive measures.\n36.  The improvement and upgrade plans to the FWTP were approved by MDEQ in\nApril of 2014.\n37.  On or about April 25, 2014, Flint formally ceased obtaining water from the DWSD\nand began drawing water from the Flint River through the FW1P .\n38.  Since LAN was involved in determining whether the Flint River could be safely\nused as a water source, it was well aware that, without proper anti-corrosive treatment, drawing\nwater from the Flint River and using it as the primary source of drinking water would create a\ncondition dangerous to the health and welfare of the community.\n39.  Pursuant to the Federal Safe Drinking Water Lead and Copper Rule (the \"LCR\"),\nall large public water systems, including Flint, are required to install and maintain corrosion\ncontrol treatment for lead and copper water service systems. In the absence of such corrosion\n8\n\n2:16-cv-10663-MOB-EAS   Doc # 1-1   Filed 02/23/16   Pg 29 of 39    Pg ID 56\ncontrol treatment, lead levels in water traveling through a lead and copper-based water system will\nbe present at unacceptable and even dangerous levels.\n40.  LAN failed to ensure that the upgraded FWTP would treat the water drawn from\nthe Flint River with the proper anti-corrosive chemicals before it was released for consumption\nand use into the community, which is contrary to water quality standards, the standard of care of\nsimilarly-situated and experienced engineers, and common sense.\n41.  At all relevant times, LAN was fully aware that, as a consequence of any failure to\noperate the FWTP by using the required and necessary anti-corrosive agents in the water drawn\nfrom the Flint River, or failure to report the non-use of these agents to the proper authorities, the\nPlaintiffs and the entire Class would be exposed to toxic levels of lead and other dangerous and\nunsafe metals and chemidals.\n42.  Despite these requirements, corrosion control chemicals were not used when the\nFWTP began operation and drawing water from the Flint River.\n43.  LAN either failed to recommend and/or design for the use of corrosion control\ntreatment chemicals during the full-time operation of the FWTP when it drew water from the Flint\nRiver, or it failed to demand or ensure the use of corrosion control treatment chemicals once the\nupgraded FWTP was placed into full-time operation.\n44.  The danger to the public in not using anti-corrosive treatments when using water\nfrom the Flint River as the primary source was or should have been well-known to LAN, as such\ndangers are well-known within the water treatment community.\n45.  Moreover, the potential consequences in endangering the public health as a result\nofn ot using anti-corrosive trealuients when using water from the Flint River as the primary source\nwere or should have been well-known and foreseeable to LAN,a n engineering firm that, according\n9\n\n2:16-cv-10663-MOB-EAS   Doc # 1-1   Filed 02/23/16   Pg 30 of 39    Pg ID 57\nto its website, is a \"national leader in the heavy civil infrastructure engineering industry,\" \"one of\nthe most respected engineering firms in the United States today,\" and \"a recognized leader in the\nindustry with a rich history of serving a diverse group of heavy civil infrastructure clients across\nthe country.\"\n46.  The potential consequences were seemingly, if not recklessly, ignored or not raised\nwith the appropriate officials by LAN.\n47.  It came (or should have come)a s no surprise to a highly reputable civil engineering\nfirm that, within days of the switch, Flint officials began receiving complaints from water users,\nincluding some or all of the Plaintiffs herein, that the water was cloudy and discolored in\nappearance and foul in taste and odor.\n48.  Within weeks following the April 25, 2014 switch, water users, including some or\nall of the Plaintiffs herein, were reporting to Flint authorities that they were experiencing hair loss,\nrashes, vomiting and other physical maladies.\n49.  Flint water users, having enjoyed decades of safe, clean and fresh water via the\nDWSD, knew almost immediately after the switch to Flint River water that something was not\nright about this new water supply.\n50.  During the next 8 months, Flint water users expressed their concerns about water\nquality in multiple ways,i ncluding letters, e-mails and telephone calls to Flint and MDEQ officials,\nthe media and through well-publicized demonstrations on the streets of Flint.\n51.  But the residents of Flint — unlike LAN — were unaware of the specific dangers\nlurking in the water that was being used and distributed by the FWTP.\n52.  For example, by August of2 014, Flint water tested positive for E. coli., and several\n\"boil water\" advisories were issued by Flint through September of 2014. As a result, Flint was\n10\n\n2:16-cv-10663-MOB-EAS   Doc # 1-1   Filed 02/23/16   Pg 31 of 39    Pg ID 58\ndeemed to  have violated the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations Maximum\nContaminant Level( \"MCL\")f or E. coli bacteria on at least two separate occasions.\n53.  Additionally, unsafe levels ofT rihalomethane( \"TTHM\")w ere present in the water.\nBeginning almost immediately after the Flint River became the primary source of water for Flint\nresidents, the MDEQ and Flint officials were aware or should have been aware of elevated and\nunlawful levels of TTHM.\n54.  By virtue ofi ts involvement with the FWTP and its continuous work for Flint, LAN\nlikewise knew or should have known oft he elevated and unlawful levels of TTHM.\n55.  In October of 2014, General Motors refused to continue using water from the Flint\nRiver in its manufacturing facilities clue to the highly corrosive nature of the water that, in turn,\nwas ruining its parts and production machinery. General Motors believed that the corrosive nature\noft he water was due to high chloride levels.\n56.  In November of 2014, LAN was on actual notice of the need to assess the factors\ncontributing to high TTHM levels following the water source change because LAN was engaged\nto evaluate this issue by Flint and provide a report of its findings, which it did in August of 2015.\n57.  After about 7 months of elevated TTHM levels, Flint water users belatedly received\na notice in January of 2015 stating that their water was not in compliance with the Federal Safe\nDrinking Water Act because unlawful levels of TTHM.\n58.  The biggest danger was the high level of lead in the water. The residents of Flint,\nincluding Plaintiffs and the Class Members, initially had no knowledge that the water contained\ndangerous levels of lead, even though LAN knew or should have known by virtue of its history\nand involvement with the FWTP, as well as its vast experience with civil engineering relating to\nwater systems.\n11\n\n2:16-cv-10663-MOB-EAS   Doc # 1-1   Filed 02/23/16   Pg 32 of 39    Pg ID 59\n59.  In late 2014 or early 2015, a study by the Michigan Department of Health and\nHuman Services (\"MDHHS\") was published that showed a dramatic spike in elevated blood lead\nlevels in Flint's youngest children. The testing occurred in the Third Quarter of 2014.\n60.  This aforementioned spike meant that, by the Third Quarter of2 014,t he percent of\nFlint children with known elevated blood lead level tests rose from 2.5% to about 7%.\n61.  This upward spike coincided precisely with the exposure of Flint's children to the\ntoxic water oft he untreated Flint River, in their homes, schools and other public locations.\n62.  That the aforementioned spike occurred at the time of the exposure to the Flint\nRiver water constituted clear and certain notice that a major health emergency confronted the\nchildren of Flint.\n63.  Furthermore, a dramatic spike in Legionnaires' disease occurred in Flint that, upon\ninformation and belief, resulted in 10 deaths in 18 months. This spike in Legionnaires' disease,\nupon information and belief, is attributable, in whole or in part, to the presence of harmful\nchemicals and substances in the drinking water.\n64.  On or about May 6, 2015, employees from EPA Region 5 arrived in Flint and began\nsampling the water for elevated lead levels, which disclosed dangerously high lead levels.\n65.  The EPA also found that lead levels from the Flint River were twice the limit that\nwould classify Flint River water as hazardous waste.\n66.  On or about June 24, 2015, EPA representative Miguel Del Toral wrote a detailed\nmemo entitled \"High Lead Levels in Flint, Michigan-Interim Report,\" outlining numerous dangers\nand hazards associated with the water being pumped from the Flint River, including unacceptable\nlevels of lead. According to Mr. Del Toral's memo, because there had been a failure to use the\nsame chemical treatments for lead and copper after Flint made the switch in 2014, corroded\n12\n\n2:16-cv-10663-MOB-EAS   Doc # 1-1   Filed 02/23/16   Pg 33 of 39    Pg ID 60\nplumbing was likely leaching lead (\"In the absence of any corrosion control treatment, lead levels\nin drinking water can be expected to increase') and making its way to the water taps found in the\nhomes of Flint's residents, including the homes of the Plaintiffs and the Class Members.\n67.  During the spring and summer of 2015, Professor Marc Edwards (\"Professor\nEdwards\") and other experts from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (commonly\nknown as \"Virginia Tech\") tested 277 drinking water samples in Flint and found that 10% of the\nsamples had lead levels of 25 parts per billion (ppb), substantially in excess of the federal action\nlevel of 15 ppb.\n68.  Professor Edwards was quoted as saying \"1 have never in my 25-year career seen\nsuch outrageously high levels going into another home in the United States.\"\n69.  Professor Edwards also determined that water from the Flint River was 19 times\nmore corrosive than the water pumped from Lake Huron by the DWSD,a nd that without corrosion\ncontrol treatment, lead was leaching out from the lead-based service lines at alarming rates and\nfinding its way to the homes of Flint's residents, including but not limited to the homes of the\nPlaintiffs.\n70.  Professor Edwards has stated that the lead leaching into the water was predictable\nbecause of the chloride content in the water, but that he \"didn't see anything that proper treatment\ncouldn't render potable.\"\n71.  On or about September 2, 2015, Professor Edwards published the results of his\nstudies described above.\n72.  At around the same time, Dr. Hanna-Attisha, a pediatrician at Hurley Hospital\ndemonstrated and publicly disclosed a dramatic and dangerous spike in elevated blood lead levels\nin a large cohort of Flint children corresponding with the time of exposure to the highly corrosive\n13\n\n2:16-cv-10663-MOB-EAS   Doc # 1-1   Filed 02/23/16   Pg 34 of 39    Pg ID 61\nFlint River water. She produced her study evidencing these elevated blood lead levels on or about\nAugust of 2015.\n73.  On or about September 29, 2015, the Genesee County Health Department issued a\n\"Public Health Advisory for People Using the Flint City Water Supply with the Flint River as the\nSource,\"( the \"Advisory\"), which stated in pertinent part: \"recent data provided by Hurley Hospital\nResearchers has indicated that a significant increase in blood lead levels has occurred in children\nsince the switch to Flint River water.\"\n74.  On or about October 8,2 015, Flint's Eisenhower and Freeman Elementary Schools,\nalong with Brownell and Holmes STEM Academies,e xceeded 15 ppb for lead — the safety standard\nset forth by the Federal Government. Students and staff were ordered to drink bottled water only.\n75.  Properties were also heavily impacted. For example,t he prolonged exposure of the\nhighly corrosive water without adequate anti-corrosive agents may have irreparably damaged lead\nand copper plumbing throughout Flint, all of which must now be repaired or replaced.\n76.  In February of2 016,t he Detroit Free Press reported on the sharp decline in property\nvalues as a result of the water crisis in Flint.  According to the article, certain individuals that\nspecialize in property tax matters estimate that the property values in Flint, due to the water crisis,\nwill drop as much as 25%. In at least one instance, property value(s) were found to be 75% less\nthan pre-exposure levels.\n77.  According to this Detroit Free Press article, Eric Dean Morse,t he president ofF lint-\nbased Allied Real Estate Appraisers, indicated that lenders are \"already skittish about lending in\nFlint .. . \" and that \"[e]ight months ago [it] was a completely different market than what's going\non now.\"\n14\n\n2:16-cv-10663-MOB-EAS   Doc # 1-1   Filed 02/23/16   Pg 35 of 39    Pg ID 62\n78.  In February of 2016, Charles \"Charlie LeDuff, an on-air journalist for Detroit Fox\naffiliate WJBK, published a TV spot relating to LAN's role in the so-called Flint Water Crisis.\nAccording to the TV spot, when Mr. LeDuff went to LAN's Flint, Michigan office, it was empty\nand looked abandoned, even though Flint recently retained LAN for connecting the FWTP to the\nKWA.\n79.  There is an amalgamation of interests, activities and the roles of LAN and LAD\nthat blur the legal distinction between the corporations that include, but are not limited to:\na.  LAD and LAN have interlocking officers and directors. For example,L AN\nand LAD share the same executive personnel — ChiefE xecutive Officer Leo\nA. Daly III and President Dennis W. Petersen — who, upon information and\nbelief, control and direct the companies as one.\nb.  LAD and LAN share offices in Houston, Texas.\nc.  LAN holds itself out to the world as a LAD company.\nd.  LAD'S website homepage contains the LAN logo and a link to the LAN\nwebsite.\ne.  LAN holds itself out to world as \"A Leo A. Daly Company\" on LAN's\nwebsite, reports, and even on the buildings where its offices are located\n(including its office in Flint).\nf  the Terms and Conditions of Use, Privacy Statement on the LAD website\nindicate that it and LAN are not separate and distinct entities by making\njoint assertions such as their intellectual property rights and warranty\ndisclaimers, which explicitly declare that \"'LEO A DALY', 'Lockwood\nAndrews & Newnam', and 'LAN' are trademarks of Leo A. Daly\nCompany.\"\ng. LAD'S \"services are extended through Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam,\nInc.( LAN), a Leo A. Daly Company.\"\n80.  Upon information and belief, LAN is a subsidiary of LAD, which exerts a degree\nof control over LAD greater than what is normally associated with common ownership and\ndirectorship, such that LAN exists as a separate entity from LAD in name only. Upon further\n15\n\n2:16-cv-10663-MOB-EAS   Doc # 1-1   Filed 02/23/16   Pg 36 of 39    Pg ID 63\ninformation and belief, LAN is totally reliant upon LAD for direction with regard to all critical\naspects of the issues giving rise to this lawsuit.\n81.  Upon information and belief, because LAN does not manifest separate corporate\ninterests from those of LAD and functions solely to achieve the corporate purposes of LAD,\nretention of their separate corporate personalities and identities would promote injustice in the\ncontext of this lawsuit.\n82.  Due to this amalgamation ofi nterest, activities and roles, LAD should be held liable\nfor any judgment entered against LAN and in favor of the Plaintiffs.\nPROFESSIONAL NEGLIGENCE\n83.  Plaintiffs incorporate the preceding paragraphs as though fully stated herein.\n84.  Defendants owed a duty to Plaintiffs, as residents and property owners in the City\nof Flint, to exercise that degree of care consistent with the greater degree of knowledge and skill\npossessed by design professionals, as well as an ethical duty to report to public authorities the\ndangers posed to public health and property that would result from the failure to install and/or\noperate a proper anti-corrosive treatment when using the Flint River as a primary source of\ndrinking.\n85.  Defendants also owed a duty to Plaintiffs to notify the proper authorities of\nunethical or illegal practices of others whose actions or decisions posed threats to public health\nand property that would result from the failure to install and/or operate a proper anti-corrosive\ntreatment when using the Flint River as a primary source of drinking.\n86.  Plaintiffs had a right to and did rely upon Defendants' professional expertise and\nethical obligations in connection with Defendants' administration of placing the Flint Water Plant\ninto operation using the Flint River as a primary source.\n16\n\n2:16-cv-10663-MOB-EAS   Doc # 1-1   Filed 02/23/16   Pg 37 of 39    Pg ID 64\n87.  Defendants' duties to Plaintiffs included, but were not limited to, the duty to\nproperly administer the placing the FWTP into operation using the Flint River as a primary source,\nto do so in such a manner that would not endanger the health and property of Plaintiffs and Class\nMembers, take other actions consistent with the greater degree of knowledge and skill possessed\nby design professionals, and/or the duty to report to public authorities the dangers posed to public\nhealth and property that would result from the failure to install and/or provide proper anti-corrosive\ntreatment when using the Flint River as a primary source of drinking.\n88.  There is also an inference that Defendants breached their collective duties to\nPlaintiffs and the Class Members since the spike in lead levels does not normally occur unless\nwater is not properly treated, such as the non-use of anti-corrosion tea 'lents in providing finished\nwater drawn from a water source and transported through a pipe system known or should have\nbeen known to require the use of such anti-corrosion treatments.\n89.  As a direct result of Defendants' so negligently, carelessly and/or recklessly\nadministering the placing of the FWTP into operation using the Flint River as a primary source\nand/or failing to report to public authorities the dangers posed to public health and property that\nwould result from the failure to install and/or provide proper anti-corrosive treatment when using\nthe Flint River as a primary source of drinking, Plaintiffs and Class Members have experienced\nserious and in some cases life-threatening and irreversible bodily injury.\n90.  Plaintiffs and Class Members have and will also incur substantial economic losses\nincluding but not limited to medical expenses and lost wages.\n91.  Plaintiffs and Plaintiff Class Members are also entitled to an award of non-\neconomic and/or exemplary damages in the nature of pain and suffering, embarrassment, outrage,\nmental anguish, fear, sense of insult, indignity, humiliation and mortification, and stress related\n17\n\n2:16-cv-10663-MOB-EAS   Doc # 1-1   Filed 02/23/16   Pg 38 of 39    Pg ID 65\nphysical symptoms such as sleepiness, gastro-intestinal discomfort, neuropathy and similar\nsymptoms.\n92.  Additionally, Plaintiffs and Plaintiff Class Members have experienced property\ndamage to the homes and places of business in the nature of lost property value (due to both the\nneed to repair their property and the loss in market value oft heir property given the stigma attached\nto the Flint area due to the massive regular media reporting of the lead contamination resulting\nfrom Defendants' negligence) and seek damages to remediate the permanent damage caused by\nthe use of corrosive water without proper anti-corrosive treatment.\nRELIEF REQUESTED \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs request the following relieff rom the court:\na.  An order certifying this case as a Class Action;\nb.  An order for an award of full compensatory damages for those injuries and\ndamages, including  diminution  of property  values,  sustained  by  Class\nRepresentatives and all Class Members;\nc.

John Corbett O’Meara\nLOCKWOOD, ANDREWS & \nNEWNAM, P.C., a Michigan\ncorporation, LOCKWOOD, \nANDREWS & NEWNAM, Inc., \na Texas corporation, and LEO A. \nDALY COMPANY, a Nebraska \ncorporation,\nDefendants.\n________________________________/\nOPINION AND ORDER GRANTING\nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO REMAND\nBefore the court is Plaintiffs’ motion to remand, filed March 24, 2016, and\nwhich has been fully briefed.  For the reasons explained below, Plaintiffs’ motion\nis granted.\nBACKGROUND FACTS\nThis case is one of many arising out of the water crisis in Flint, Michigan.\nThe city, under state emergency management, switched its drinking water source in\nApril 2014 from Lake Huron (via the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department) to\nthe Flint River in an effort to save money.  Plaintiffs allege that the Flint River\n\n5:16-cv-10663-JCO-MKM   Doc # 23   Filed 05/11/16   Pg 2 of 12    Pg ID 1459\nwater was not properly treated with anti-corrosive chemicals, leading to the\ncorrosion of lead pipes and the leaching of lead and other contaminants into the\ndrinking water of Flint residents.  The named Plaintiffs “at all relevant times, were\nresidents of Flint, who as individuals, parents of minors and as property owners,\nhave been and continue to be exposed to highly dangerous conditions created and\ncaused by Defendants’ negligent administration of a plan to place the Flint Water\nTreatment Plaint (“FWTP”) into full-time operation for drawing water from the\nFlint River.” Compl. at ¶2.  Defendants are engineering firms that contracted with\nthe City of Flint to design and implement the new water treatment system.   \nLAW AND ANALYSIS\nPlaintiffs filed this action in Genesee County Circuit Court, alleging a single\ncount of professional negligence.  Defendants removed it to this court on February\n23, 2016, based on two grounds: substantial federal question jurisdiction and the\nClass Action Fairness Act.  Plaintiffs argues that jurisdiction is lacking and that the\ncourt should remand the case to state court.\nI. Substantial Federal Question Jurisdiction\nIn similar Flint water cases against Lockwood, the court determined that the\nplaintiffs’ negligence claims did not involve a substantial federal question and that\nthe court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.  See, e.g., Bell v. Lockwood, Andrews\n-2-\n\n5:16-cv-10663-JCO-MKM   Doc # 23   Filed 05/11/16   Pg 3 of 12    Pg ID 1460\n& Newnam, Case No. 16-10825 (E.D. Mich.), Docket No. 17.  In this respect, this\ncase is indistinguishable from Bell.  Accordingly, for the reasons stated in Bell, the\ncourt finds that Plaintiffs’ professional negligence claim against Defendants does\nnot implicate a substantial federal question.  See id.\nII. Class Action Fairness Act\nThe remaining potential basis for jurisdiction is the Class Action Fairness\nAct (“CAFA”), which expands federal court jurisdiction over certain class actions. \nThe act provides:\n(2) The district court shall have original jurisdiction of\nany civil action in which the matter in controversy\nexceeds the sum or value of $5,000,000, exclusive of\ninterest and costs, and is a class action in which – \n(A) any member of a class of plaintiffs is a\ncitizen of a State different from any\ndefendant;\n* * *\n28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(2).  The parties do not dispute that these requirements are met\nhere, when the aggregate amount in controversy exceeds $5,000,000 and there is\nminimal diversity of citizenship between the parties.  See 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(6)\n(“claims of the individual class members shall be aggregated to determine whether\nthe matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $5,000,000\").  \nPlaintiffs contend that the “local controversy exception” to the CAFA\n-3-\n\n5:16-cv-10663-JCO-MKM   Doc # 23   Filed 05/11/16   Pg 4 of 12    Pg ID 1461\napplies and that the court must decline to exercise jurisdiction.  According to the\nstatute:\n(4) A district court shall decline to exercise jurisdiction under\nparagraph (2) – \n(A)(i) over a class action in which –\n(I) greater than two-thirds of the members of\nall proposed plaintiff classes in the\naggregate are citizens of the State in which\nthe action was originally filed;\n(II) at least 1 defendant is a defendant – \n(aa) from whom significant\nrelief is sought by members of\nthe plaintiff class;\n(bb) whose alleged conduct\nforms a significant basis for the\nclaims asserted by the proposed\nplaintiff class; and\n(cc) who is a citizen of the State\nin which the action was\noriginally filed; and \n(III) principal injuries resulting from the\nalleged conduct or any related conduct of\neach defendant were incurred in the State in\nwhich the action was originally filed; and\n(ii) during the 3-year period preceding the filing of that\nclass action, no other class action has been filed asserting\nthe same or similar factual allegations against any of the\ndefendants on behalf of the same or other persons; . . . .\n28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(4).\nCAFA’s “primary objective” is to “ensur[e] Federal court consideration of\ninterstate cases of national importance.” Standard Fire Ins. Co. v. Knowles, 133 \n-4-\n\n5:16-cv-10663-JCO-MKM   Doc # 23   Filed 05/11/16   Pg 5 of 12    Pg ID 1462\nS.Ct. 1345, 1350 (2013).  The local controversy exception \nis intended to respond to concerns that class actions with\na truly local focus should not be moved to federal court\nunder this legislation because state courts have a strong\ninterest in adjudicating such disputes. At the same time,\nthis is a narrow exception that was carefully drafted to\nensure that it does not become a jurisdictional loophole.\nThus, the Committee wishes to stress that in assessing\nwhether each of these criteria is satisfied by a particular\ncase, a federal court should bear in mind that the purpose\nof each of these criteria is to identify a truly local\ncontroversy that uniquely affects a particular locality to\nthe exclusion of all others.\nS. REP. 109-14, 39, 2005 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3, 38.  As discussed below, the court finds\nthis case is precisely the type of local controversy to which the exception was\nintended to apply.\nA. Citizenship of Proposed Class\nIn order to meet the first requirement of the local controversy exception,\nPlaintiffs must show that more than two-thirds of the proposed class are citizens of\nMichigan.  The complaint alleges that the named plaintiffs are residents of and\nproperty owners in Flint, Michigan.  Compl. at ¶¶ 1, 2, 5.  The complaint contends\nthat the “residents of the City of Flint (“Flint”), from April 25, 2014 to the present,\nhave experienced and will continue to experience serious personal injury and\nproperty damage.” Id. at ¶ 1.  See also Compl. at ¶ 64 (“LAN owed a duty to \n-5-\n\n5:16-cv-10663-JCO-MKM   Doc # 23   Filed 05/11/16   Pg 6 of 12    Pg ID 1463\nPlaintiffs, as residents and property owners in the City of Flint. . . .”).\nAlthough residency is not synonymous with citizenship, “[e]vidence of a\npersons place of residence . . . is prima facie proof of his domicile.” Hollinger v.\nHome State Mut. Ins. Co., 654 F.3d 564, 571 (5th Cir. 2011).  “The place where an\nindividual resides is properly taken to be his domicile, absent a showing to the\ncontrary.” Novel v. Zapor, 2013 WL 1183331 at *5 (S.D. Ohio Mar. 21, 2013)\n(citing District of Colombia v. Murphy, 314 U.S. 441, 445 (1914)).  See also Fort\nKnox Transit v. Humphrey, 151 F.2d 602, 602-603 (6th Cir. 1945) (“[U]pon the\nwhole record and in the absence of any challenge to the jurisdiction, the plaintiff's\nresidence in Ohio is prima facie evidence of his citizenship in that state.”).\nAlthough the class Plaintiffs seek to represent is not expressly limited to\nMichigan citizens, Plaintiffs are Flint residents and property owners who seek to\nrepresent those similarly situated.  See Hollinger, 654 F.3d at 573 (“[C]ourts have\nacknowledged that where a proposed class is discrete in nature, a common sense\npresumption should be utilized in determining whether citizenship requirements\nhave been met.”); Caruso v. Allstate Ins. Co., 469 F. Supp. 2d 364, 368 (E.D. La.\n2007) (“Although there well may be proposed classes where detailed proof of the\ntwo-thirds citizenship requirement is required, the Court finds that common sense\nshould prevail in this closed-end class involving people who, as noted, hold an\n-6-\n\n5:16-cv-10663-JCO-MKM   Doc # 23   Filed 05/11/16   Pg 7 of 12    Pg ID 1464\nasset that is a measure of domicile, their home.”); Eagles Nest LLC v. Moy Toy,\nLLC, 2014 WL 4655277 at *5 (M.D. Tenn. Sept. 16, 2014) (“This case involves a\ndefined class of Tennessee property owners, and an indicia of domicile is property\nownership.”).\nFurther, the proposed class is comprised of Flint residents over a relatively\nlimited period of time (beginning in April 2014) who “have experienced and will\ncontinue to experience serious personal injury and property damage.” Compl. at ¶\n1.  This discrete time period and the continuing nature of the alleged injury –\nexperienced in Flint – also demonstrates that the class is concentrated in Michigan. \nThere are no circumstances – such as a large number of college students, military\npersonnel, owners of second homes, or other temporary residents – suggesting that\nthese Flint residents are anything other than citizens of Michigan.  Cf. Evans v.\nWalter Indus., Inc., 449 F.3d 1159 (11th Cir. 2006) (no sufficient proof of Alabama\ncitizenship of “extremely broad” class of “all individuals who have come in\ncontact” with hazardous substances over period of 85 years).  Based upon the\ncontours of the proposed class, the concentration of injury in a specific location in\nMichigan over a relatively short period of time, and the absence of evidence\nsuggesting otherwise, Plaintiffs have sustained their burden of demonstrating that\nmore then two-thirds of the proposed class are citizens of Michigan.  See also\n-7-\n\n5:16-cv-10663-JCO-MKM   Doc # 23   Filed 05/11/16   Pg 8 of 12    Pg ID 1465\nCoco v. Heck Indus., Inc., 2014 WL 1029994 (W.D. La. Mar. 17, 2014) (sufficient\nevidence of Louisiana citizenship when class members were injured as a result of\noperation of concrete plant near their homes in Louisiana).1\nB. Significant Local Defendant\nTo meet the second requirement of the local controversy exception,\nPlaintiffs must show that at least one defendant is a Michigan citizen whose\nconduct forms a “significant basis” of their claims and from whom the class seeks\n“significant relief.” 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(4)(A)(i)(II).  This requirement ensures\nthat jurisdiction is not defeated by the presence of a nominal defendant.  In\ndetermining whether this requirement is met, the court looks to the allegations in\nthe complaint.  See, e.g., Coleman v. Estes Exp. Lines, Inc., 631 F.3d 1010, 1015-\n17 (9th Cir. 2011). “If the local defendant’s alleged conduct is a significant part of\nthe alleged conduct of all the Defendants, then the significant basis provision is\nsatisfied.” Kaufman v. Allstate New Jersey Ins. Co., 561 F.3d 144, 156 (3d Cir.\n2009).\nDefendant Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, P.C. (“LAN P.C.”) is a\nMichigan corporation with its principal place of business in Flint, Michigan.  The\n1Indeed, Defendants alleged that Plaintiffs were “citizens of the State of\nMichigan” in their Notice of Removal.  See Notice of Removal at ¶ 15.\n-8-\n\n5:16-cv-10663-JCO-MKM   Doc # 23   Filed 05/11/16   Pg 9 of 12    Pg ID 1466\nother defendants are Lockwood, Andrews, & Newnam, Inc. (“LAN, Inc.”), a Texas\ncorporation with its principal place of business in Texas, and Leo A. Daly\nCompany, a Nebraska corporation with its principal place of business in Nebraska. \nThe complaint does not appear to seek direct relief against the Leo A. Daly\nCompany, but alleges that it is liable based upon its control over LAN and the lack\nof “legal distinction” between the companies.  Compl. at ¶¶ 3, 79-82.\nThe complaint alleges that LAN Inc. conducted business in Genesee County,\nMichigan, “through LAN P.C.” Compl. at ¶ 4.  Plaintiffs allege that LAN Inc. and\nLAN P.C. (collectively referred to as LAN) provided engineering services to Flint\nto upgrade the Flint Water Treatment Plant, allowing it to draw drinking water\nfrom the Flint River.  Compl. at ¶ 26-27.  Plaintiffs claim that “LAN failed to\nensure that the upgraded FWTP would treat the water drawn from the Flint River\nwith the proper anti-corrosive chemicals before it was released for consumption\nand use into the community. . . .” Id. at ¶ 40.  Plaintiffs’ professional negligence\nclaim is based upon Defendants’ duty to properly administer the operation of the\nFWTP so as not to endanger the health and property of Plaintiffs and the class.\nHere, Plaintiffs seek direct, significant relief on behalf of all class members\nagainst LAN P.C.  Based upon Plaintiffs’ allegations, LAN P.C. is not a nominal \n-9-\n\n5:16-cv-10663-JCO-MKM   Doc # 23   Filed 05/11/16   Pg 10 of 12    Pg ID 1467\ndefendant, but is the Michigan licensed professional engineer through with LAN,\nInc. and Leo A. Daly Company operated in Michigan.  The court finds that the\n“local defendant” requirement is satisfied.\nC. Principal Injuries Incurred in Michigan\nThe third requirement of the local controversy exception to the CAFA is that\nthe “principal injuries resulting from the alleged conduct or any related conduct of\neach defendant were incurred in the State in which the action was originally filed.”\n28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(4)(A)(i)(III).  In light of Plaintiffs’ allegation that they are\nresidents of Flint who have been and continue to be injured in Flint, there can be\nno serious doubt that this requirement is satisfied.  See Compl. at ¶¶1, 2. \nD. No Other Class Action\nThe fourth requirement is that “no other class action has been filed asserting\nthe same or similar factual allegations against any of the defendants on behalf of\nthe same or other persons” during the three-year period preceding the filing of this\ncase. 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(4)(A)(ii).  The parties do not dispute that this element is\nmet.  Moreover, the court has remanded dozens of similar individual cases against\nLockwood to state court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  If the court were to\nretain jurisdiction over this action, Lockwood would be defending similar actions \n-10-\n\n5:16-cv-10663-JCO-MKM   Doc # 23   Filed 05/11/16   Pg 11 of 12    Pg ID 1468\nin two forums, frustrating Congress’s intent that “defendants did not face copycat,\nor near copycat, suits in multiple forums.” Vodenichar v. Halcon Energy\nProperties, Inc., 733 F.3d 497, 508-509 (3d Cir. 2013).  On the other hand, “if this\nCourt remands the case, the lawsuits, which, by their facts and allegations do not\npresent any matters of national interest, will be handled in a single jurisdiction in\nwhich the cases originated and in which the causes of action arose.”  Logan v.\nCLUB Metro USA LLC, 2015 WL 7253935, at *3 (D.N.J. Nov. 17, 2015). \nIII. Attorney’s Fees\nPlaintiffs seek attorney’s fees pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c), which\nprovides that an “order remanding the case may require payment of just costs and\nany actual expenses, including attorney fees, incurred as a result of the removal.”\nId.  “Absent unusual circumstances, courts may award attorney’s fees under §\n1447(c) only where the removing party lacked an objectively reasonable basis for\nseeking removal.” Martin v. Franklin Capital Corp., 546 U.S. 132, 141 (2005).\nAlthough the court finds that the local controversy exception to the CAFA\napplies, it is undisputed that the initial requirements for removal (amount in\ncontroversy and minimal diversity) were met.  28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(2).  Defendants\ndid not, therefore, lack an objectively reasonable basis for removal and the court\nwill not award attorney’s fees. \n-11-\n\n5:16-cv-10663-JCO-MKM   Doc # 23   Filed 05/11/16   Pg 12 of 12    Pg ID 1469\nIV. Conclusion\nThe court concludes that this is “a truly local controversy that uniquely\naffects a particular locality to the exclusion of all others” and that it must decline to\nexercise jurisdiction pursuant to the CAFA.  See S. REP. 109-14, 39, 2005\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 3, 38. \nORDER\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiff’s motion to remand is GRANTED\nand this action is REMANDED to Genesee County Circuit Court.\ns/John Corbett O’Meara \nUnited States District Judge\nDate:  May 11, 2016\nI hereby certify that a copy of the foregoing document was served upon\ncounsel of record on this date, May 11, 2016, using the ECF system.\ns/William Barkholz \nCase Manager\n-12-",

Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, et al.  Page 2 \n \n_________________ \nOPINION \n_________________ \nGRIFFIN, Circuit Judge.  This state-law professional negligence proposed class action \nsuit arises out of the Flint Water Crisis, a public health disaster that drew national media \ncoverage when the City of Flint decided to supply water to its residents using the Flint River \nwithout implementing necessary anti-corrosion measures.  The series of events precipitating the \ntragedy have little to do with the issue before us on appeal.  We deal, instead, with a question of \nprocedure:  must plaintiffs litigate their claim in state or federal court?  In 2005, Congress \nrevised the contours of federal diversity jurisdiction, making it easier to remove class actions to \nfederal court, while at the same time providing an exception for cases that are “truly local in \nnature,”  commonly  called  the  “local  controversy”  exception.    The  parties  dispute  whether \nplaintiffs’  claim  against  defendants  (civil  engineering  companies  responsible  for  upgrading \nFlint’s municipal water system) belongs in state court under this exception.  Though the Flint \nWater Crisis captured the attention of the nation, its infamy does not make it any less local.  \nBecause plaintiffs’ suit consists of a proposed class of more than two-thirds Michigan citizens, a \nsignificant local defendant, and injuries limited to the reach of Flint’s water system, it satisfies \nthe statutory requirements of the local controversy exception.  We therefore affirm the district \ncourt’s decision to remand this case to state court. \nI. \nIn  2005,  Congress  enacted  the  Class  Action  Fairness  Act  (CAFA)  in  response  to \n“perceived abusive practices by plaintiffs and their attorneys in litigating major class actions \nwith interstate features in state courts.”  Coffey v. Freeport McMoran Copper & Gold, 581 F.3d \n1240, 1243 (10th Cir. 2009).  CAFA “loosened the requirements for diversity jurisdiction,” \nMississippi ex rel. Hood v. AU Optronics Corp., 134 S. Ct. 736, 739 (2014), authorizing federal \ndistrict courts to “hear a ‘class action’ if the class has more than 100 members, the parties are \nminimally diverse, and the ‘matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $5,000,000.’”  \nStandard  Fire  Ins.  Co.  v.  Knowles,  133  S.  Ct.  1345,  1348  (2013)  (quoting  28  U.S.C. \n§ 1332(d)(2), (d)(5)(B)).  That expansion of diversity jurisdiction was with exceptions.  See \n \n\n      Case: 16-2313     Document: 24-2     Filed: 11/16/2016     Page: 3\nNo. 16-2313  Mason, et al. v. Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, et al.  Page 3 \n \n28 U.S.C.  § 1332(d)(3),  (d)(4)(A),  (d)(4)(B).    One,  which  Congress  called  the  “Local \nControversy Exception,” S. Rep. No. 109-14 (2005), reprinted in 2005 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3, 28, is \ncodified at § 1332(d)(4)(A).  Under this exception, “[a] district court shall decline to exercise \njurisdiction . . . over a class action” if: \n(I) greater than two-thirds of the members of all proposed plaintiff classes \nin the aggregate are citizens of the State in which the action was \noriginally filed;   \n(II) at least 1 defendant is a defendant-- \n(aa) from whom significant relief is sought by members of the \nplaintiff class;   \n(bb) whose alleged conduct forms a significant basis for the claims \nasserted by the proposed plaintiff class; and   \n(cc) who is a citizen of the State in which the action was originally \nfiled; and   \n(III) principal injuries resulting from the alleged conduct or any related \nconduct of each defendant were incurred in the State in which the \naction was originally filed; and   \n(ii) during the 3-year period preceding the filing of that class action, no other class \naction has been filed asserting the same or similar factual allegations against any \nof the defendants on behalf of the same or other persons[.] \n§ 1332(d)(4)(A).  If these four elements are present, the district court must abstain from hearing \nthe case, despite having jurisdiction under § 1332(d)(2).   \nLike all statutes, the text of CAFA controls.  Caminetti v.United States, 242 U.S. 470, \n485 (1917); Vander Boegh v. EnergySolutions, Inc., 772 F.3d 1056, 1060 (6th Cir. 2014).  In this \nregard, its text must be read as a whole, not in isolation. United States v. Morton, 467 U.S. 822, \n828 (1984).  The relaxation of normal diversity requirements is coupled with an exception for \nlocal controversies. The terms of the statute balance considerations of federalism—a balance \ndefined by Congress, but implemented and respected by the federal courts. \n \n\n      Case: 16-2313     Document: 24-2     Filed: 11/16/2016     Page: 4\nNo. 16-2313  Mason, et al. v. Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, et al.  Page 4 \n \nII. \n  In April 2013, the City of Flint, Michigan, decided to switch its primary drinking water \nprovider from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (“DWSD”) to the newly formed \nKaregnondi Water Authority (“KWA”).  The KWA would not be operational for another three \nyears, however, so Flint needed an interim source of drinking water.  It decided to draw from the \nFlint River, which had previously supplied back-up water services to the City.  Relying on the \nFlint River, however, posed a few problems.  According to several reports, the river was a highly \nsensitive drinking water source that required anti-corrosive treatment in order to prevent heavy \nmetals from leaching into the water.  On top of that, these issues needed to be remedied quickly, \nas the City’s contract with DWSD was set to expire a year later in April 2014.   \nThe City turned to Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, Inc., a Texas-based corporation that \ntouted itself as a “national leader in the heavy civil infrastructure engineering industry,” and its \nMichigan-based affiliate, Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, P.C. (collectively, “defendants”) for \nassistance.  On June 26, 2013, the City entered into a contract with defendants for design \nengineering  services  in  connection  with  rehabilitating  Flint’s  Water  Treatment  Plant  (“the \nPlant”).  After confirming with City officials that they could make the necessary improvements \nand  provide  the  necessary  “quality  control”  in  time  for  the  April  2014  switch,  defendants \nproceeded to develop rehabilitation plans for the Plant.  In April 2014, the Michigan Department \nof Environmental Quality approved defendants’ rehabilitation plans.  Notably, the plan did not \ninclude necessary upgrades for anti-corrosive treatment measures.  Indeed, earlier that month, \ndefendants and officials from the City and the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality \nconsidered  the  issue,  but  decided  that  more  data  was  advisable  before  implementing  any \nmeasures for “optimization for lead.”   \nOn April 25, 2014, the City of Flint began supplying its residents drinking water from the \nFlint River.  The harmful effects were as swift as they were severe.  Within days, residents \ncomplained of foul smelling and tasting water.  Within weeks, some residents’ hair began to fall \nout and their skin developed rashes.  And within a year, there were positive tests for E. coli, a \nspike in deaths from Legionnaires’ disease, and worst of all, reports of dangerously high blood \nlead levels in Flint children.  All of this resulted, according to one expert who studied the crisis, \n \n\n      Case: 16-2313     Document: 24-2     Filed: 11/16/2016     Page: 5\nNo. 16-2313  Mason, et al. v. Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, et al.  Page 5 \n \nbecause the “water from the Flint River was 19 times more corrosive than the water pumped \nfrom Lake Huron by the DWSD, and that without corrosion control treatment, lead was leaching \nout of the lead-based service lines at alarming rates and finding its way to the homes of Flint’s \nresidents.”  In his view, it was “predictable,” but preventable. \nIII. \nOn January 25, 2016, eight Flint residents filed suit in state court, alleging one count of \nprofessional negligence against defendants.  Plaintiffs contended that defendants knew the Plant \nrequired upgrades for lead contamination treatment, yet failed to ensure such safeguards were \nimplemented as part of the rehabilitation, resulting in widespread personal injuries and property \ndamage.  They sought relief on behalf of themselves and all other similarly situated “residents \nand property owners in the City of Flint” who used water from the Flint River from April 25, \n2014, to the present day.   \nDefendants removed the action to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(2).  Plaintiffs filed a motion to remand to state court.  They did not contest \nthe basic requirements for diversity jurisdiction under CAFA.  They argued instead that the \nmandatory “local controversy” exception to CAFA jurisdiction applied.  Plaintiffs asserted that \nthe class citizenship and principal injuries elements were not in dispute, citing the allegations in \ntheir complaint that the class consisted of Flint residents and that their injuries were suffered in \nFlint.  They also argued that LAN, P.C., a Michigan professional corporation, was a significant \ndefendant  because  it  was  the  entity  responsible  under  Michigan  law  for  certifying  that \ndefendants’ work satisfied applicable standards of care.  Finally, they contended that no party \nhad filed a similar suit against defendants in the past three years.   \n  Defendants countered that the class citizenship element was very much in dispute and \nthat  the  mere  allegation  of  residency,  alone,  was  not  sufficient  to  establish  citizenship.  \nDefendants also argued that the mere fact that LAN, P.C. certified the engineering plans does not \nestablish its conduct formed a significant basis of plaintiffs’ negligence claim. Rather, LAN, Inc., \na Texas corporation, was the more significant defendant since it contracted with Flint to provide \nthe engineering services that plaintiffs alleged were negligently performed.   \n \n\n      Case: 16-2313     Document: 24-2     Filed: 11/16/2016     Page: 6\nNo. 16-2313  Mason, et al. v. Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, et al.  Page 6 \n \nThe district court granted plaintiffs’ motion to remand.  It found that more than two-\nthirds of the putative class members were likely Michigan citizens.  Relying primarily on the \nrebuttable presumption of domicile based on residency and the absence of any contrary evidence, \nthe court also observed that the proposed class consisted of residents who, over a relatively \nlimited period of time, experienced a continuing injury localized in Flint.  The court also found \nthat LAN, P.C.’s (the Michigan defendant’s) conduct formed a significant basis of plaintiffs’ \nclaim because defendants’ engineering services were provided “through LAN, P.C.”   \nDefendants  timely  petitioned  for  permission  to  appeal,  which  this  court  granted  on \nSeptember 20, 2016.  In re Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, P.C., No. 16-0102, at 2 (6th Cir. \nSept. 20, 2016).  Our order initiated a 60-day clock in which we are required to issue a decision.  \nIn re Mortg. Elec. Registration Sys., Inc., 680 F.3d 849, 853 (6th Cir. 2012).   \nIV. \nA. \n  We begin our analysis on an issue that enjoys unanimity, both between the parties and \namong the circuits, but which is nonetheless an important starting point:  the burden of proof.  \nThe parties and every circuit to have addressed this issue all agree that the party seeking to \nremand under an exception to CAFA bears the burden of establishing each element of the \nexception by a preponderance of the evidence.  See Woods v. Standard Ins. Co., 771 F.3d 1257, \n1262 (10th Cir. 2014); Westerfeld v. Indep. Processing, LLC, 621 F.3d 819, 822 (8th Cir. 2010); \nGreenwich Fin. Servs. Distressed Mortg. Fund 3 LLC v. Countrywide Fin. Corp., 603 F.3d 23, \n26 (2d Cir. 2010); In re Hannaford Bros. Co. Customer Data Sec. Breach Litig., 564 F.3d 75, 78 \n(1st Cir. 2009); Kaufman v. Allstate N.J. Ins. Co., 561 F.3d 144, 153 (3d Cir. 2009); Serrano v. \n180 Connect, Inc., 478 F.3d 1018, 1024 (9th Cir. 2007); Hart v. FedEx Ground Package Sys. \nInc., 457 F.3d 675, 680 (7th Cir. 2006); Frazier v. Pioneer Ams. LLC, 455 F.3d 542, 546 (5th \nCir. 2006); Evans v. Walter Indus., Inc., 449 F.3d 1159, 1164 (11th Cir. 2006).   \nWe agree with the universal wisdom of our sister circuits for two, interrelated reasons.  \nFirst, the language of “local controversy” exception indicates that it is not part of the initial \njurisdictional calculus.  Section 1332(d)(4) provides that “[a] district court shall decline to \n \n\n      Case: 16-2313     Document: 24-2     Filed: 11/16/2016     Page: 7\nNo. 16-2313  Mason, et al. v. Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, et al.  Page 7 \n \nexercise jurisdiction under paragraph (2)” if certain conditions are met.  Congress’s use of \n“decline” is important.  It necessarily implies a prior determination of jurisdiction, since “a court \ncould not ‘decline’ jurisdiction that it never had in the first place.”  Clark v. Lender Processing \nServs., 562 F. App’x 460, 465 (6th Cir. 2014).  Second, the longstanding rule is that “whenever \nthe subject matter of an action qualifies it for removal, the burden is on a plaintiff to find an \nexpress exception.”  Breuer v. Jim’s Concrete of Brevard, Inc., 538 U.S. 691, 698 (2003).  Just \nas nothing in CAFA alters the traditional rule that the removing party bears the burden of \nestablishing the jurisdictional elements, see Smith v. Nationwide Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co., 505 F.3d \n401, 404 (6th Cir. 2007), we find nothing in the statute indicating that Congress intended to \nupend Breuer’s traditional rule.  We therefore hold that the party seeking to remand bears the \nburden of establishing an exception to CAFA jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. \nPlaintiffs, as the moving party, must establish all four elements of the local controversy \nexception.  But, as defendants only contest the two-thirds citizenship and “significant basis” \nrequirements, we confine our inquiry to those elements.  We take each in turn.   \nB. \n  The first element of the local controversy exception requires the movant to show that \n“greater than two-thirds of the members of all proposed plaintiff classes in the aggregate are \ncitizens of the State in which the action was originally filed[.]”  § 1332(d)(4)(A)(I).  “Citizen” \nand its variant “citizenship” have acquired a particular meaning in our law as being equivalent to \n“domicile.”  Von Dunser v. Aronoff, 915 F.2d 1071, 1072 (6th Cir. 1990) (“State citizenship . . . \nis equated with domicile.”); see also N.L.R.B. v. Amax Coal Co., a Div. of Amax, 453 U.S. 322, \n329 (1981) (“Where Congress uses terms that have accumulated settled meaning . . . , a court \nmust  infer,  unless  the  statute  otherwise  dictates,  that  Congress  means  to  incorporate  the \nestablished meaning of these terms.”).  Thus, although the statute speaks in terms of citizenship, \na party invoking the local controversy exception is effectively tasked with establishing the \ndomicile of the proposed class members.   \nAccording to their complaint, plaintiffs seek to represent all “residents and property \nowners in the City of Flint” who used water from the Flint River from April 25, 2014, to the \n \n\n      Case: 16-2313     Document: 24-2     Filed: 11/16/2016     Page: 8\nNo. 16-2313  Mason, et al. v. Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, et al.  Page 8 \n \npresent day, and were thereby injured by defendants’ professional negligence.  Defendants \ncontend that the district court erred in finding that, more likely than not, two-thirds of this \nproposed class were citizens of Michigan.   \nIn evaluating defendants’ challenge, two long-standing propositions of law inform our \nanalysis.  The first relates to our standard of review:  an appellate court will not disturb a district \ncourt’s factual findings, including those regarding the citizenship of parties, “unless the record \nleaves us with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.”  Ne. Ohio \nCoal. for the Homeless v. Husted, 837 F.3d 612, 625 (6th Cir. 2016) (bracketing and quotation \nmarks omitted); Cameron v. Children’s Hosp. Med. Ctr., 131 F.3d 1167, 1170 (6th Cir. 1997) \n(recognizing that citizenship is question of fact).  The second relates to the substantive law of \ndomicile:  the law affords a rebuttable presumption that a person’s residence is his domicile.  \nSee, e.g., D.C. v. Murphy, 314 U.S. 441, 455 (1941).  Taken together, these principles lead us to \naffirm the district court’s holding that plaintiffs satisfied the two-thirds citizenship requirement. \nIn elemental terms, domicile consists of (1) residence and (2) an intent to remain there.  \nMiss. Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield, 490 U.S. 30, 48 (1989).  In practice, however, the \nlaw of domicile has long been one of presumptions.  In his Commentaries on the Conflict of \nLaws, for example, Joseph Story listed over a dozen such presumptions, including:  a person’s \nplace of birth is presumptively their domicile; a child’s domicile is presumptively that of their \nparents; and, most important for our purposes, “primâ facie, the place, where a person lives, is \ntaken to be his domicil, until other facts establish the contrary.”  Joseph Story, Commentaries on \nthe Conflict of Laws, § 46 (5th ed. 1857).   \nIn recognizing the primacy of residency in the domicile calculus, Story was simply \ndrawing from established legal tradition.  As early as 1790, England’s House of Lords declared \nthat “[a] person’s being at a place is primâ facie evidence that he is domiciled at that place, and it \nlies on those who say otherwise to rebut that evidence.”  Bruce v. Bruce, 2 Bos. & Pull. 229, note \n(a).  Not long after, the presumption made its way into American law.  See 10 Am. & Eng. Ency. \nLaw, Domicile, at 22 (2d ed.) (collecting early state and federal cases).  In 1852, the United \nStates Supreme Court announced that “[w]here a person lives, is taken primâ facie to be his \ndomcil, until other facts establish the contrary.”  Ennis v. Smith, 55 U.S. 400, 423 (1852).  And in \n \n\n      Case: 16-2313     Document: 24-2     Filed: 11/16/2016     Page: 9\nNo. 16-2313  Mason, et al. v. Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, et al.  Page 9 \n \nthe 150 years since, the rule of thumb on residency and domicile has remained fixed:  “The place \nwhere a man lives is properly taken to be his domicile until facts adduced establish the contrary.”  \nMurphy, 314 U.S. at 455; Anderson v. Watts, 138 U.S. 694, 706 (1891); Mitchell v. United \nStates, 88 U.S. 350, 352 (1874); Hollinger v. Home State Mut. Ins. Co., 654 F.3d 564, 571 (5th \nCir. 2011); Krasnov v. Dinan, 465 F.2d 1298, 1300 (3d Cir. 1972); Walden v. Broce Const. Co., \n357 F.2d 242, 245 (10th Cir. 1966); Fort Knox Transit v. Humphrey, 151 F.2d 602, 602 (6th Cir. \n1945); 28 C.J.S. Domicile § 45; 39 Am. Jur. Proof of Facts 2d 587, § 8.   \nWe emphasize the historical pedigree of the residency-domicile presumption because the \ndistrict court primarily based its finding that plaintiffs met their burden under § 1332(d)(4)(A)(I) \non the same.  As a class that consists of Flint residents, the district court was correct, in light of \nthe long-standing authority charted above, to afford plaintiffs the rebuttable presumption that \neach  resident  class  member  was  domiciled  there.    Rather  than  rebut  the  presumption  with \nevidence undermining the inference, defendants countered that merely alleging residency cannot, \nas a matter of law, suffice to satisfy the burden of demonstrating citizenship.   \nIn support of their assertion, defendants point to a competing line of case law holding that \n“naked averment of . . . residence . . . is insufficient to show his citizenship.”  Robertson v. \nCease, 97 U.S. 646, 648 (1878).  This principle also enjoys a rich pedigree in our law.  See, e.g., \nBingham v. Cabot, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 382, 383–84 (1798) (“str[iking] off the docket” many cases \nthat alleged residence rather than citizenship); Steigleder v. McQuesten, 198 U.S. 141, 143 \n(1905) (“[I]t has long been settled . . . that a mere averment of residence in a particular state is \nnot an averment of citizenship in that state for the purposes of jurisdiction.”).  More significantly \nfor defendants, many cases, including several from the CAFA context, have explicitly rejected \nthe residency-domicile presumption based on the proposition that mere averment of residency \ncannot establish citizenship.  See, e.g., Reece v. AES Corp., 638 F. App’x 755, 769 (10th Cir. \n2016) (stating in the CAFA exception context, “To be sure, the place of residence is prima facie \nthe domicile.  But allegations of mere residence may not be equated with citizenship” (internal \nquotations omitted); Johnson v. Advance Am., 549 F.3d 932, 937 n.2 (4th Cir. 2008) (“For \npurposes of diversity jurisdiction, residency is not sufficient to establish citizenship.”). \n \n\n      Case: 16-2313     Document: 24-2     Filed: 11/16/2016     Page: 10\nNo. 16-2313  Mason, et al. v. Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, et al.  Page 10 \n \nOn  closer  inspection,  however,  we  are  not  persuaded  this  line  of  cases  presents \ncompelling authority for rejecting the residency-domicile presumption in this case.  The reason \nfor this lies in the context from which the “mere averment of residency” line of cases emerged—\nfederal subject-matter jurisdiction.   \nIn that context, “[t]he established rule is that a plaintiff, suing in a federal court, must \nshow in his pleading, affirmatively and distinctly, the existence of whatever is essential to federal \njurisdiction[.]”  Smith v. McCullough, 270 U.S. 456, 459 (1926).  This long-settled principle \nderives from the fact that federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.  Kokkonen v. Guardian \nLife Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994).  As a consequence of this restriction on federal \njudicial power, federal jurisdiction may not be “maintained by mere averment,” McNutt v. Gen. \nMotors Acceptance Corp. of Indiana, 298 U.S. 178, 189 (1936), “inferred argumentatively,” \nBrown v. Keene, 33 U.S. 112, 115 (1834), or “supplied by inference,” La Belle Box Co. v. \nStricklin, 218 F. 529, 533 (6th Cir. 1914).  Put differently, and in terms germane to the present \ndiscussion, there is a presumption against federal jurisdiction.  Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at 377; \nThomas v. Bd. of Trustees of the Ohio State Univ., 195 U.S. 207, 218 (1904); Vander Boegh, \n772 F.3d at 1064.   \nThe tension between the residency-domicile presumption and the presumption against \nfederal jurisdiction came to a head in Robertson v. Cease, 97 U.S. 646 (1878).  In that case, the \nplaintiff argued that “a general allegation of residence, without indicating the character of such \nresidence, whether temporary or permanent, made a prima facie case of right to sue in the \nFederal courts.”  Id. at 649. The Court rejected the contention because, “[a]s the jurisdiction of \nthe Circuit Court is limited in the sense that it has none except that conferred by the Constitution \nand laws of the United States, the presumption . . . is[] that a cause is without its jurisdiction \nunless the contrary affirmatively appears.”  Id. at 649.  From the Court’s view, in being asked to \nadopt the residency-domicile presumption, it was, “in effect, asked, in support of the jurisdiction \nof the court below, to infer argumentatively, from the mere allegation of ‘residence,’ that . . . [the \nplaintiff] had a fixed permanent domicile in [Illinois].”  Id. at 650.  The Court could not accept \nthat  proposition  because,  under  well-settled  precedent  defining  the  federal  courts’  diversity \njurisdiction, the facts establishing diversity jurisdiction could not “be inferred argumentatively \n \n\n      Case: 16-2313     Document: 24-2     Filed: 11/16/2016     Page: 11\nNo. 16-2313  Mason, et al. v. Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, et al.  Page 11 \n \nfrom its averments,” id. at 650 (quoting Brown, 33 U.S. at 115), but rather must “be distinctly \nand positively averred in the pleadings,” id. at 649.   \nBy tracing the origin of the “mere averment of residency” line of cases, we see that the \nresidency-domicile presumption was not rejected because it was specious (indeed, Robertson \ncould “not . . . den[y] that there is some force in the[] suggestion[],” id.), but because, in the \nunique context of federal diversity jurisdiction, a contrary presumption of constitutional import \ntakes precedence.  See Mansfield, C. & L.M. Ry. Co. v. Swan, 111 U.S. 379, 382 (1884) (“[T]he \nrule, springing from the nature and limits of the judicial power of the United States, is inflexible \nand without exception.”); Bender v. Williamsport Area Sch. Dist., 475 U.S. 534, 541 (1986) \n(rooting federal courts’ limited jurisdiction in Article III of the Constitution).   \nThough  the  residency-domicile  presumption  did  not  prevail  against  the  unrelenting \nheadwinds of limited federal jurisdiction, there is no reason it should suffer a similar fate under \nthe  local  controversy  exception.    As  established  at  the  outset  of  our  analysis,  the  local \ncontroversy exception is not jurisdictional.  See also Clark, 562 F. App’x at 465 (holding that \n“the exceptions are not jurisdictional”); Visendi v. Bank of Am., N.A., 733 F.3d 863, 869 (9th Cir. \n2013) (same); Gold v. N.Y. Life Ins. Co., 730 F.3d 137, 142 (2d Cir. 2013) (same); Morrison v. \nYTB Int’l, Inc., 649 F.3d 533, 536 (7th Cir. 2011) (same); Graphic Commc’ns Local 1B Health & \nWelfare Fund A v. CVS Caremark Corp., 636 F.3d 971, 973 (8th Cir. 2011) (same).  Thus, a \nparty  asserting  the  exception  does  not  encounter  a  similar  countervailing  presumption  that \nneutralizes residency’s presumptive force in establishing domicile.  In this context, it would \nfunction like a rebuttable presumption does in any other setting:  shifting the burden to the \nopposing party to rebut the inference and permitting, but not requiring, the district court to find \nthe ultimate fact.  See, e.g., 2 McCormick On Evid. § 342 (7th ed.).   \nIndeed, the residency-domicile presumption fits particularly well in the CAFA exception \ncontext, where the moving party is tasked with demonstrating a fact-centered proposition about a \nmass of individuals, many of whom may be unknown at the time the complaint is filed and the \ncase removed to federal court.  See Nicole Ochi, Are Consumer Class and Mass Actions Dead? \nComplex Litigation Strategies After CAFA & MMTJA, 41 Loy. L.A. L. Rev. 965, 1030 (2008) \n(“To  achieve  the  objective  of  these  [CAFA]  exceptions,  courts  should  grant  plaintiffs  a \n \n\n      Case: 16-2313     Document: 24-2     Filed: 11/16/2016     Page: 12\nNo. 16-2313  Mason, et al. v. Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, et al.  Page 12 \n \npresumption  of  citizenship  when  they  define  their  classes  according  to  state  residency.”); \nStephen J. Shapiro, Applying the Jurisdictional Provisions of the Class Action Fairness Act of \n2005: In Search of a Sensible Judicial Approach, 59 Baylor L. Rev. 77, 135 (2007) (advocating \nthe  same).    The  citizenship  inquiry  under  the  local  controversy  exception  should  not  be \n“exceptionally difficult,” Mondragon v. Capital One Auto Fin., 736 F.3d 880, 886 (9th Cir. \n2013), but instead “practical and reasonable.”  Hollinger, 654 F.3d at 572.  Affording the moving \nparty a rebuttable presumption of citizenship based on residency avoids the exceptional difficulty \nof proving the citizenship of a class of over 100 individuals, given the nature and timing of the \ncitizenship  inquiry  under  the  local  controversy  exception.    See  id.  at  573  (5th  Cir.  2011) \n(“[W]here a proposed class is discrete in nature, a common sense presumption should be utilized \nin determining whether citizenship requirements have been met.”).   \nThose circuits that have rejected the rebuttable presumption in the CAFA context have \nrelied on case law addressing federal subject-matter jurisdiction.  See Reece, 638 F. App’x at 769 \n(citing Whitelock v. Leatherman, 460 F.2d 507, 514 (10th Cir. 1972) (“[A]llegations of mere \n‘residence’ may not be equated with ‘citizenship’ for the purposes of establishing diversity.”)); \nIn re Sprint Nextel Corp., 593 F.3d at 673 (citing Meyerson v. Harrah’s E. Chicago Casino, \n299 F.3d 616, 617 (7th Cir. 2002) (“[R]esidence and citizenship are not synonyms and it is the \nlatter that matters for purposes of the diversity jurisdiction.”)); Preston v. Tenet Healthsystem \nMem’l Med. Ctr., Inc., 485 F.3d 793, 799 (5th Cir. 2007) (citing Mas v. Perry, 489 F.2d 1396, \n1399 (5th Cir. 1974) (“For diversity purposes, citizenship means domicile; mere residence in the \nState is not sufficient.”)).  However, these decisions extended the “mere averment of residency” \nprinciple without accounting for its underlying rationale.  The sole basis for eschewing the \nresidency-domicile presumption in Robertson was the countervailing, “inflexible” presumption \nagainst federal jurisdiction.  Swan, 111 U.S. at 382; see Robertson, 97 U.S. at 649–50.  Because \nthe  local  controversy  exception  is  not  jurisdictional,  the  premise  of  Robertson  and  its \njurisdictional  progeny  is  missing  here.    Given  this  material  distinction,  the  line  of  cases \ndefendants rely on provides no basis for rejecting the residency-domicile presumption in this \ncase.   \n \n\n      Case: 16-2313     Document: 24-2     Filed: 11/16/2016     Page: 13\nNo. 16-2313  Mason, et al. v. Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, et al.  Page 13 \n \nOne district court in our circuit has previously rejected the rebuttable presumption of \ncitizenship for a different, albeit equally unpersuasive, reason.  In Lancaster v. Daymar Colleges \nGrp.,  LLC,  the  district  court  declined  to  adopt  the  presumption  as  inconsistent  with  the \nproposition that the movant bears the burden of proving citizenship.  No. 3:11-CV-157-R, 2012 \nWL 884898, at *3 (W.D. Ky. Mar. 14, 2012).  But this proves too much.  Under this rationale, \nrebuttable presumptions would cease to exist, since the only circumstance in which they serve \nany purpose is when the beneficiary of the presumption also bears the burden of proof.  1 Jones \non Evidence § 4:2 (7th ed.) (“The underlying purpose and impact of a presumption is to affect \nthe burden of proving or disproving the presumed fact.”).  There is nothing inconsistent with \nplacing  the  burden  of  proof  on  a  particular  party  and  also  affording  them  a  rebuttable \npresumption as one way of shouldering that burden.  Indeed, our law is quite familiar with the \nconcept.  See, e.g., St. Mary’s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 506–07 (1993) (affording Title \nVII plaintiff a rebuttable presumption of unlawful discrimination if she establishes a prima facie \ncase); see also 2 McCormick On Evid. § 343 (7th ed.) (listing other popular presumptions).   \nIn a similar vein, defendants contend that our approach was rejected by the Seventh \nCircuit as “guesswork.  Sensible guesswork, based on a sense of how the world works, but \nguesswork nonetheless.”  In re Sprint Nextel Corp., 593 F.3d at 674.  Again, this criticism can be \nmade  about  presumptions  generally.    Presumptions  are  nothing  more  than  common  sense \ninferences “enlightened by human knowledge and experience.” 31A C.J.S. Evidence § 204.  \nThey are, to use Sprint’s phrase, the law’s recognition of “how the world works.”  Defendants’ \nargument  constitutes  a  wholesale  rejection  of  presumptions  generally,  a  position  we  are \ndisinclined to adopt in the absence of any reason to do so.  Having distinguished the only line of \nauthority that other cases have cited to reject the residency-domicile presumption, we see no \nreason to close our eyes to a centuries-old inference that a person’s residence is presumptively \nhis domicile.   \nThe  dissent  takes  issue  with  our  analysis  because  it  purportedly  conflicts  with  the \nprinciple of abstention that we have a “virtually unflagging obligation” to exercise jurisdiction \ngiven to us.  Because we have “no more right to decline the exercise of jurisdiction which is \ngiven, than to usurp that which is not given,” the dissent contends, “we cannot presume a fact \n \n\n      Case: 16-2313     Document: 24-2     Filed: 11/16/2016     Page: 14\nNo. 16-2313  Mason, et al. v. Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, et al.  Page 14 \n \nthat allows us to decline jurisdiction, any more than we can presume a fact that allows us to find \nthat jurisdiction exists in the first place.”  (first quoting Cohens v. State of Virginia, 19 U.S. 264, \n404 (1821)).   \nThe dissent’s recitation of abstention principles is accurate, but the conclusion it draws \nfrom  them  does  not  follow.    The  abstention  doctrines  the  dissent  invokes  are  judge-made \nexceptions to the powerful default rule that Congress alone has the constitutional authority to \ndefine the contours of federal jurisdiction.  Zwickler v. Koota, 389 U.S. 241, 248 (1967).  Thus, \nour “virtually unflagging obligation” stems from a deep sense of prudence, if not constitutional \nobedience, to listen when Congress directs federal courts to assume jurisdiction over particular \ncontroversies.  See New Orleans Pub. Serv., Inc. v. Council of City of New Orleans, 491 U.S. \n350, 359 (1989) (“Underlying these assertions is the undisputed constitutional principle that \nCongress,  and  not  the  Judiciary,  defines  the  scope  of  federal  jurisdiction  within  the \nconstitutionally permissible bounds.”).  But it is because common law abstention reflects a \ndeparture from the constitutional norm that the Supreme Court placed strict rules on its use.  It is \nfor this reason that the Supreme Court has admonished that abstention is an “extraordinary and \nnarrow exception,” Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 813 \n(1976), only to be invoked in “narrowly limited ‘special circumstances,’” Zwickler, 389 U.S. at \n248  (1967),  and  on  only  the  “clearest  of  justifications,”  Rouse  v.  DaimlerChrysler  Corp., \n300 F.3d 711, 715 (6th Cir. 2002) (quoting Colorado River, 424 U.S. at 819).   \nBut all of these common law restrictions on abstention have no place here because \nCongress has expressly directed courts to decline jurisdiction over local controversies.  For this \nreason, we disagree with the dissent’s assertion that “[w]e have nothing like a clear justification \nfor abstention here”—Congress has provided the all justification we need in § 1332(d)(4)(A).  \nWe would agree with the dissent that we have a “virtually unflagging obligation” to not decline \njurisdiction when Congress’s only word on the matter is to exercise jurisdiction.  But, when \nCongress directs something different, our obligation remains with the Constitution and the text of \nthe statute enacted by Congress.  And here Congress directed something different.  In enacting \nCAFA,  Congress  expanded  diversity  jurisdiction  while  carving  out  an  exception  for  “local \ncontroversies.”  Read together and in harmony, CAFA’s provisions explicitly instruct federal \n \n\n      Case: 16-2313     Document: 24-2     Filed: 11/16/2016     Page: 15\nNo. 16-2313  Mason, et al. v. Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, et al.  Page 15 \n \ndistrict  courts  to  remand  class  action  cases  that  satisfy  the  elements  of  §  1332(d)(4)(A), \nnotwithstanding the fact that the jurisdictional requisites are met.  In light of Congress’s explicit \ndirective to decline jurisdiction, the dissent’s common law abstention principles—born as they \nwere in the context of judicial insubordination toward Congress—are inapplicable.   \nFurthermore, we would be remiss if we did not also observe that defendants drew the \nvery same residency-domicile inference in their notice of removal.  In their notice, defendants \nalleged that minimal diversity existed because “Plaintiffs were citizens of the State of Michigan.”  \nAnd in support, defendants cited paragraph 2 of the first amended complaint, which merely \nalleged  residency,  not  citizenship.    Yet,  defendants  insist  plaintiffs  cannot  draw  the  same \ninference when it comes to similarly situated Flint residents.  Were we to take defendants’ and \nthe dissent’s argument to its logical end point, we would be compelled—on the very authority \nthat defendants argue requires this case remain in federal court—to conclude that defendants \nfailed to establish the citizenship requirement of federal diversity jurisdiction.   \nIn addition to the presumptive force of residency, there are other attributes of plaintiffs’ \nproposed class that bolster the inference that the putative class members, as residents of Flint, \nintend to remain there indefinitely.  First, according to plaintiffs’ class definition, the class \nmembers have continuously resided in Flint, Michigan, for several years.  Nat’l Artists Mgmt. \nCo.  v.  Weaving,  769  F.  Supp.  1224,  1228  (S.D.N.Y.  1991)  (listing  as  a  relevant  domicile \nconsideration  “the  nature  of  the  residence  (i.e.,  how  permanent  the  living  arrangement \nappears)”); Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws, Chapter 2:  Domicile, Topic 2 Spec. Note \n(1971) (“Residing for a considerable time in a place is persuasive evidence of domicil there \n. . . .”).  In this respect, the district court astutely observed, “There are no circumstances—such as \na  large  number  of  college  students,  military  personnel,  owners  of  second  homes,  or  other \ntemporary residents—suggesting that these Flint residents are anything other than citizens of \nMichigan.”  Moreover, by definition, the putative class members are property owners, another \nstrong indicator of domicile.  Edick v. Poznanski, 6 F. Supp. 2d 666, 669 (W.D. Mich. 1998) \n(citing  1  Moore’s  Federal  Practice  ¶  0.74[3.3]  (1991  &  Supp.  1993)).    Finally,  it  bears \nmentioning that Flint, Michigan, is nowhere near a state line (it lies near the crook of the thumb \n \n\n      Case: 16-2313     Document: 24-2     Filed: 11/16/2016     Page: 16\nNo. 16-2313  Mason, et al. v. Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, et al.  Page 16 \n \nin the figurative “Michigan hand”), which further undermines the notion that the traditional \nresidency-domicile inference is not appropriate in this particular case.   \nAgainst this backdrop, defendants submitted no evidence to rebut the presumption that \nthe putative class members were citizens of Michigan.  Instead, they merely relied on case law \nfrom other circuits stating that mere allegations of residency are not sufficient to establish \ncitizenship.  They did so at their peril.  In light of the long-standing presumption of domicile \nbased on residency, the additional domicile factors apparent from the class definition, and the \ncomplete  absence  of  any  evidence  tending  to  rebut  the  presumption  of  domicile  based  on \nresidency, we hold that the district court did not clearly err in finding that, more likely than not, \nmore than two-thirds of the proposed class of Flint residents were Michigan citizens.   \nC. \n  Defendants also contest the district court’s finding that LAN, P.C.’s “alleged conduct \nforms a significant basis for the claims asserted by the proposed plaintiff class.”  28 U.S.C. \n§ 1332(d)(4)(A)(i)(II)(bb).   \nWe  have  yet  to  interpret  this  provision,  but  those  circuits  that  have  are  in  general \nagreement that this provision “effectively calls for comparing the local defendant’s alleged \nconduct to the alleged conduct of all the Defendants.”  Kaufman, 561 F.3d at 156; see also \nWoods, 771 F.3d at 1266 (following Kaufman); Westerfeld, 621 F.3d at 825 (same).  “The local \ndefendant’s alleged conduct must be an important ground for the asserted claims in view of the \nalleged conduct of all the Defendants.”  Kaufman, 561 F.3d at 157.  After taking into account the \ntotality of the conduct forming the basis of plaintiff’s claims, we must consider whether “the \nlocal  defendant’s  alleged  conduct  is  a  significant  part  of  the  alleged  conduct  of  all  the \nDefendants[.]”  Id. at 156.  If so, the “significant basis” provision is satisfied.   \n  This case involves a single claim of professional negligence against three defendants: \nLAN,  P.C.  (a  Michigan  corporation),  LAN,  Inc.  (a  Texas  corporation),  and  Leo  A.  Daly \nCompany (a Nebraska corporation).  The conduct underlying plaintiffs’ claim is the provision of \nengineering  design  services  in  connection  with  upgrades  to  Flint’s  Water  Treatment  Plant, \n \n\n      Case: 16-2313     Document: 24-2     Filed: 11/16/2016     Page: 17\nNo. 16-2313  Mason, et al. v. Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, et al.  Page 17 \n \nincluding  drafting  and  implementing  the  engineering  plans  and  providing  “quality  control” \nmeasures.   \nWe begin with the third defendant, Leo A. Daly Company.  Plaintiffs’ complaint does not \nallege that Leo A. Daly Company engaged in any engineering services.  Instead, plaintiffs allege \nthat Leo A. Daly Company is LAN, P.C.’s and LAN, Inc.’s corporate alter ego, thereby making \nLeo A. Daly Company vicariously liable for LAN’s tortious conduct.  Given plaintiffs’ theory of \nliability, Leo A. Daly Company’s role in plaintiffs’ negligence claim is minimal at best. \nThat leaves LAN, P.C. and LAN, Inc.  The complaint alleges professional negligence \nagainst both defendants and further alleges that all engineering work was conducted “through \nLAN, P.C.”  More specifically, the complaint alleges that LAN, P.C. was formed to conduct \nLAN, Inc.’s work in Michigan, and that Flint relied on LAN, P.C.—as the LAN entity that \n“work[ed] with several water systems around the state”—to “perform quality control.”  The \nfailure to provide that quality control is the very core of plaintiffs’ professional negligence claim.  \nWe therefore agree with the district court that LAN, P.C.’s conduct forms an “important” and \nintegral part of plaintiffs’ professional negligence claim.   \nDefendants argue that the professional services agreement with the City shows that its \nprofessional relationship was with LAN, Inc., not LAN, P.C.  Even assuming we may properly \nconsider this extrinsic evidence, compare Coleman v. Estes Exp. Lines, Inc., 631 F.3d 1010, \n1015 (9th Cir. 2011) (limiting scope of “significant basis” inquiry to complaint), with Evans, \n449 F.3d at 1167–68 (considering extrinsic evidence under “significant basis” provision), it does \nnot alter our conclusion.  That Flint formally contracted with LAN, Inc. is not inconsistent with \nplaintiffs’ allegation that LAN, Inc. provided its services “through LAN, P.C.”  Moreover, the \nagreement acknowledges that LAN, Inc. would not be the only entity providing the services.  It \nstates that “all of the obligations required by [LAN, Inc.] under this Contract shall be performed \nby [LAN, Inc.] or by others employed by him and working under his direction and control.”  \nThis buttresses plaintiffs’ allegation that LAN, P.C., as the LAN entity that “work[ed] with \nseveral water systems around the state,” was responsible for “perform[ing] quality control,” and \nwas the entity “through” which defendants provided their engineering services.   \n \n\n      Case: 16-2313     Document: 24-2     Filed: 11/16/2016     Page: 18\nNo. 16-2313  Mason, et al. v. Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, et al.  Page 18 \n \nDefendants also argue that, according to plaintiffs’ own complaint, LAN, P.C. conducted \na majority of its business in LAN, Inc.’s Chicago office.  However, the “significant basis” \nprovision is not concerned with where the conduct occurred, but rather with who engaged in the \nconduct.  § 1332(d)(4)(A)(i)(II)(bb) (requiring that a local defendant be a defendant “whose \nalleged conduct forms a significant basis for the claims . . . .” (emphasis added)).  LAN, P.C. is a \nMichigan corporation and its conduct—regardless of where it is carried out—is evaluated against \nthat of the other defendants.  The allegations that LAN, P.C. was responsible for quality control, \nin conjunction with the allegation that defendants’ engineering work in Flint was conducted \n“through LAN P.C.,” are sufficient to establish that LAN, P.C.’s conduct forms a “significant \nbasis” of plaintiffs’ professional negligence claim.   \nV. \n  For the foregoing reasons, we agree with the district court that plaintiffs established the \nclass citizenship and significant basis requirements of the local controversy exception to CAFA.  \nIt is also important that we not lose sight of the forest for the trees.  The local controversy \nexception exists to ensure that “a truly local controversy—a controversy that uniquely affects a \nparticular locality to the exclusion of all others”—remains in state court.  S. Rep. No. 109-14, 39 \n(2005), reprinted in 2005 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3, 38.  By that definition, and the statutory elements \nCongress set forth to achieve that vision, the case before us exemplifies the quintessential local \ncontroversy.  Indeed, it defies common sense to say a suit by Flint residents against those \npurportedly responsible for injuring them through their municipal water service is not a “local \ncontroversy.”   \nFor these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court. \n   \n \n\n      Case: 16-2313     Document: 24-2     Filed: 11/16/2016     Page: 19\nNo. 16-2313  Mason, et al. v. Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, et al.  Page 19 \n \n_________________ \nDISSENT \n_________________ \nKETHLEDGE, Circuit Judge, dissenting.  To meet a burden of proof, a party usually \nmust provide some.  Here, it is common ground that the federal courts have jurisdiction over this \ncase and that the plaintiffs bear the burden of proving that we may lawfully abstain from \nexercising that jurisdiction.  The plaintiffs have not met that burden, or even tried. \nBy way of background, the federal courts “have a strict duty to exercise the jurisdiction \nthat is conferred upon them by Congress.”  Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., 517 U.S. 706, 716 \n(1996).  Abstention is an “extraordinary and narrow exception” to that duty.  Colorado River \nWater Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 813 (1976).  Thus, only the “clearest of \njustifications” will justify abstention.  Rouse v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., 300 F.3d 711, 715 (6th \nCir. 2002). \nWe  have  nothing  like  a  clear  justification  for  abstention  here.    The  federal  courts \nundisputedly have jurisdiction over this case under the Class Action Fairness Act.  See 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1332(d).  Instead the question here, broadly stated, is whether we may abstain from exercising \nthat jurisdiction per the Act’s so-called “local-controversy exception.”  For that exception to \napply—and thus for us lawfully to send the case back to state court—the plaintiffs must prove, \namong other things, both that more than two-thirds of the putative class-members “are citizens of \nthe State in which the action was originally filed” (i.e., Michigan) and that the alleged conduct of \nthe sole Michigan defendant “forms a significant basis for the claims” of the putative class.  Id. \n§ 1332(d)(4)(A)(I), (II)(bb). \nThe plaintiffs have proved neither.  As for the first requirement, every circuit to have \nconsidered the issue—five so far—has held that “there must ordinarily be at least some facts in \nevidence  from  which  the  district  court  may  make  findings  regarding  the  class  members’ \ncitizenship for purposes of CAFA’s local-controversy exception.”  Mondragon v. Capital One \nAuto Finance, 736 F.3d 880, 884 (9th Cir. 2013) (gathering cases); see also Reece v. AES Corp., \n638 Fed. App’x 755, 769-70 (10th Cir. 2016); In re Sprint Nextel Corp., 593 F.3d 669, 674-676 \n \n\n      Case: 16-2313     Document: 24-2     Filed: 11/16/2016     Page: 20\nNo. 16-2313  Mason, et al. v. Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, et al.  Page 20 \n \n(7th Cir. 2010); Preston v. Tenet Healthsystem Mem’l Med. Ctr., Inc., 485 F.3d 793, 799-801 \n(5th Cir. 2007); Evans v. Walter Indus., Inc., 449 F.3d 1159, 1166 (11th Cir. 2006).  Meanwhile, \nas the majority correctly observes, citizenship in this context equates to domicile, and domicile \nconsists of both residence in a State and an intention to remain there.  Maj. Op. at 7-8.  Thus, to \nmeet this requirement, the plaintiffs must show by a preponderance of the evidence that more \nthan two-thirds of the putative class-members both reside in Michigan and intend to remain \nthere.  But on those points (or any other) the plaintiffs have presented no evidence at all.  Instead \nthey merely cite the allegations in their complaint.  That, per the law of every circuit to have \naddressed the issue, is reason enough to conclude that we must exercise our jurisdiction in this \ncase.   \nThe majority concludes otherwise by means of a presumption.  As an initial matter, the \nguesswork here begins with even defining the putative class, since the plaintiffs neglected to \ndefine it in their putative class-action complaint.  But the complaint does say that the class-\nmembers are similarly situated to the plaintiffs, and that the plaintiffs are “residents and property \nowners in the City of Flint” who (or which, as the case may be) were exposed to water supplied \nfrom the Flint River after April 25, 2014.  Complaint ¶¶ 1, 84.  Plaintiffs’ counsel also clarified \nduring oral argument that the phrase “property owners” does not modify “residents,” but instead \ndescribes  a  separate  group  within  the  putative  class.    Thus,  taking  the  allegations  and \nclarification together, one can surmise that the class includes residents exposed to the Flint water \nsupply after April 25, 2014, and property owners likewise exposed.   \nAt this point the majority’s presumption arises.  According to the majority, the plaintiffs \nhave alleged that the class members are residents of Flint, which (in the majority’s view) creates \na presumption that they are citizens as well, which in turn throws upon the defendants the burden \nof proving that one-third of the putative class are not citizens of Michigan.  But this reasoning is \nmistaken both factually and legally.  The factual mistake is the assertion that the plaintiffs have \nalleged that all the class members are Flint residents, since—per the statement of plaintiffs’ \ncounsel at oral argument—the class includes Flint “property owners” who need not be residents \nof  Flint  (or  Michigan)  to  be  members  of  the  class.    Thus,  the  majority’s  presumption  of \ncitizenship does not apply to “property owners”—whose numbers are anyone’s guess.  Even the \n \n\n      Case: 16-2313     Document: 24-2     Filed: 11/16/2016     Page: 21\nNo. 16-2313  Mason, et al. v. Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, et al.  Page 21 \n \nmajority’s presumption, therefore, does not provide us with anything near what the law would \nregard as a proper basis to conclude that two-thirds—as opposed to one-third, or one-half, or \nthree-quarters—of the putative class-members are Michigan citizens.  We thus lack the requisite \n“clearest of justifications” to decline to exercise our jurisdiction here.  Rouse, 300 F.3d at 715. \nThe majority’s legal mistake is more complicated.  The majority observes, correctly, that \n“there is a presumption against federal jurisdiction[,]” Maj. Op. at 10, which in any particular \ncase the party asserting jurisdiction must overcome.  See Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of \nAm., 511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994).  Thus, the majority reasons further, the federal courts cannot \npresume in diversity cases—where the existence of the court’s jurisdiction depends on the \nparties’ citizenship—that a party is a citizen of a state simply because the party is a resident of it.  \nFor in that event the court would presume that jurisdiction exists, when instead the court must \npresume that it does not.  But here the situation is different, the majority reasons, because in this \ncase the federal courts already have jurisdiction; the question instead is whether to exercise it.  \nThe majority thus splits with five other circuits, and concludes that we are free to presume that a \nmere allegation of residency in Michigan is enough to prove citizenship there. \nWhat the majority overlooks, however, is the “virtually unflagging obligation of the \nfederal courts to exercise the jurisdiction given them.”  Colorado River, 424 U.S. at 817.  As \nChief Justice Marshall put it nearly 200 years ago:  “We have no more right to decline the \nexercise of jurisdiction which is given, than to usurp that which is not given.”  Cohens v. \nVirginia, 19 U.S. 264, 404 (1821); see also Sprint Communications, Inc. v. Jacobs, 134 S.Ct. \n584, 590-91 (2013) (same).  That means we cannot presume a fact that allows us to decline \njurisdiction, any more than we can presume a fact that allows us to find that jurisdiction exists in \nthe  first  place.    Thus,  just  as  we  cannot  presume  that  residency  equals  citizenship  when \ndetermining  whether  jurisdiction  exists,  neither  can  we  apply  that  same  presumption  when \ndetermining whether we can decline jurisdiction.  And that is exactly what the majority does \nhere. \nI would therefore dispense with all the dueling presumptions, and instead simply ask \nwhat the other circuits ask:  whether the plaintiffs have produced “evidence from which the \ndistrict court may make findings” that more than two-thirds of the putative class-members are \n \n\n      Case: 16-2313     Document: 24-2     Filed: 11/16/2016     Page: 22\nNo. 16-2313  Mason, et al. v. Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, et al.  Page 22 \n \ncitizens of the State in which the case was originally filed.  Mondragon, 736 F.3d at 884.  Here, \nthe plaintiffs have not produced such evidence, or even any evidence at all.  That conclusion, \nstanding alone, means that we must exercise our jurisdiction in this case. \nMore briefly, the plaintiffs have likewise failed to show that the only Michigan defendant \nin this case—Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, P.C. (“Lockwood P.C.”)—is one “whose alleged \nconduct forms a significant basis for the claims asserted by the proposed plaintiff class[.]”  \n28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(4)(A)(II)(bb). As an initial matter, as the Ninth Circuit has persuasively \nexplained, the statutory reference to “alleged conduct” means that (in contrast to the citizenship \nrequirement) we look solely to the allegations in the complaint when determining whether the \nplaintiffs have met this prerequisite to abstention.  See Coleman v. Estes Exp. Lines, Inc., \n631 F.3d 1010, 1015 (9th Cir. 2011).  Our inquiry as to this prerequisite is comparative:  we ask \nwhether  the  in-state  defendant’s  conduct,  as  alleged  in  the  complaint,  is  important  when \ncompared to the conduct of the other defendants as so alleged.  See, e.g., Westerfield v. Ind. \nProcessing LLC, 621 F.3d 819, 825 (8th Cir. 2010); Kaufman v. Allstate N.J. Ins. Co., 561 F.3d \n144, 156 (3d Cir. 2009); Evans, 449 F.3d at 1167. \nHere, the plaintiffs’ allegations as to the Michigan defendant—Lockwood P.C.—are an \nenigma.  The complaint alleges that the City of Flint retained a Texas corporation—Lockwood, \nAndrews Newnam, Inc. (“Lockwood Inc.”), which is likewise a defendant here—“to conduct \nstudies and reports of a new water supply that was being developed” for the City.  Complaint ¶ 3.  \nThe complaint also alleges that Lockwood P.C. “was incorporated in 2008 by” Lockwood Inc. \nafter the latter was so retained, and that Lockwood Inc. “conducted business in Genesee County, \nMichigan through” Lockwood P.C.  The complaint then proceeds to define both Lockwood \nentities collectively as “LAN,” which for the remainder of the complaint is the subject of every \nverb describing conduct allegedly forming the basis of the plaintiffs’ claims.  Thus, as in a Fifth \nCircuit case, “nothing in the complaint distinguishes the conduct of [Lockwood P.C.] from the \nconduct of the other defendants.”  Opelousas Gen. Hosp. Auth. v. FairPay Sols., Inc., 655 F.3d \n358, 362 (5th Cir. 2011).  The complaint therefore “contains no information about the conduct of \n[Lockwood P.C.] relative to the conduct of the other defendants[,]” and thus does not establish \nthat  Lockwood  P.C’s  conduct  “forms  a  significant  basis  of  the  plaintiff[s’]  claims.”    Id.  \n \n\n      Case: 16-2313     Document: 24-2     Filed: 11/16/2016     Page: 23\nNo. 16-2313  Mason, et al. v. Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, et al.  Page 23 \n \nMoreover,  the  complaint  never  explains  what  the  plaintiffs  mean  by  their  allegation  that \nLockwood Inc. conducted business “through” Lockwood P.C.  Instead, that phrase remains an \nexercise in studied ambiguity.  Finally, what the complaint does say about the conduct of the \ndefendants relative to one another affirmatively suggests that the more significant actor was the \nremaining defendant, Leo A. Daly Company, a Nebraska corporation (which the complaint calls \n“LAD”).  Specifically, the complaint alleges that “LAN is a subsidiary of LAD,” that “LAN \nexists as a separate entity from LAD in name only[,]” and that “LAN is totally reliant upon LAD \nfor  direction  with  regard  to  all  critical  aspects  of  the  issues  giving  rise  to  this  lawsuit.”  \nComplaint ¶ 80.  The complaint thus provides plenty of reason to conclude that LAD’s conduct \nwas significant as compared to either of the Lockwood entities, but no basis at all to conclude \nthat the conduct of Lockwood P.C., in particular, was significant as compared to the conduct of \nthe other defendants.  Indeed, the district court never found that Lockwood P.C.’s alleged \nconduct formed a “significant basis” for the claims of the putative class.  Instead, the majority \nsupplies that finding for the first time in its opinion today. \nIt should take a better showing than this for a federal court to cast off its unflagging duty \nto exercise the jurisdiction assigned to it by Congress.  I respectfully dissent. \n \n\n      Case: 16-2313     Document: 24-3     Filed: 11/16/2016     Page: 1\nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT \n \nNo. 16-2313 \n \nJENNIFER MASON, et al., \nPlaintiffs - Appellees, \n \nv. \n \nLOCKWOOD, ANDREWS & NEWNAM, P.C.,  \na Michigan corporation; LOCKWOOD, ANDREWS \n& NEWNAM, INC., a Texas corporation, \nDefendants - Appellants, \n \nLEO A.
