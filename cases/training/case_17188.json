    "summary": "<p>This case is one of many filed in response to the 2014 Flint water crisis, which occurred when Flint began to draw corrosive water from the Flint River to save money, exposing thousands to lead and other toxins.</p>\r\n<p>On June 27, 2016, a resident of Flint who drank and bathed in lead-contaminated water filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan on behalf of herself and her minor child. (The complaint named, but did not describe, a second individual plaintiff who was also a resident of Flint exposed to unsafe water.) The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, sued the City of Flint, the State of Michigan, and various government officials and private contractors under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 and state law. They sought general, compensatory and punitive damages, an order declaring the defendants&rsquo; conduct unconstitutional, equitable relief to remediate the harm they had suffered, and attorneys&rsquo; fees. The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants&rsquo; failure to provide safe drinking water and their provision of deliberate misinformation about the safety of the drinking water violated their due process and common law rights.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that the defendants knew the water was contaminated yet continued to publicly state the water was safe. By doing so, the plaintiffs claimed that the defendants showed deliberate indifference to their bodily integrity and property rights, breached their contract to provide safe water, breached the implied warranty that the water they sold was safe, and interfered with the plaintiffs&rsquo; ability to enjoy their home, which constituted a nuisance. In addition, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants&rsquo; failure to adequately test the water was negligent, and the failure to provide safe drinking water was grossly negligent.</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to Judge Judith E. Levy. On October 27, 2016, the defendants moved to change venue, arguing that the overwhelming extent of adverse media coverage would make a fair and impartial jury nearly impossible in the Eastern District of Michigan. The defendants requested a venue change to an out of state metropolitan venue or the Northern Division of the Western District of Michigan, which they claimed was the least prejudicial venue in Michigan.</p>\r\n<p>In the following weeks, all defendants moved to dismiss the action and argued that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim. Some defendants who were government officials sued in their official capacities raised immunity defenses and argued that the proprietary function exception to governmental immunity did not apply to the sale of water.</p>\r\n<p>On January 23, 2017, the court denied the motion to change venue. The court noted that plaintiffs can ordinarily choose the venue, the majority of the defendants lived nearby, and most of the evidence was in the area. It determined that a venue change so far before trial would be premature. 2017 WL 6390962.</p>\r\n<p>On June 5, 2017, the court granted in part and denied in part the motions to dismiss. Judge Levy dismissed the plaintiffs&rsquo; breach of contract, breach of implied warranty, nuisance, trespass, gross negligence, professional negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED), and negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED) claims. She also dismissed the plaintiff&rsquo;s due process claims that related to property loss and state-created danger, as well as the plaintiffs&rsquo; bodily integrity claims as to the government defendants and officials acting within their official capacities. The court also declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the plaintiffs&rsquo; unjust enrichment claim. But the plaintiffs&rsquo; bodily integrity claims against officials acting in their individual capacities survived because the court determined the alleged conduct of the governmental defendants was so egregious as to shock the conscience and violate the plaintiffs&rsquo; clearly established fundamental right to bodily integrity; the court accordingly denied the defendants&rsquo; claims to qualified immunity on this count. The plaintiffs&rsquo; ordinary negligence claims against the contractors also survived. 2017 WL 2418007.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Judge Levy indicated that she planned to consolidate all of the class action cases arising from the Flint water crisis. In this case, the plaintiffs moved for leave to add class allegations and to consolidate with the other class actions on June 23, 2017.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On July 27, 2017, Judge Levy consolidated eight class actions (16-cv-10796, 16-cv-11173, 16-cv-11247, 16-cv-12875, 16-cv-14498, 17-cv-10343, 17-cv-10360, and 17-cv-10799) with <em><a href=\"../../../../case/16508/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Waid v. Snyder</a> </em>(later captioned <em>In re Flint Water Cases)</em>. But she declined to consolidate this case, likely because it was not originally filed as a class action.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Litigation also continued over the court&rsquo;s decision on the motions to dismiss. Various government officials appealed the district court&rsquo;s June 5, 2017 decision denying them qualified immunity, and district court proceedings were stayed on October 30, 2017 while the appeals proceeded. 2017 WL 4875618. The Sixth Circuit (Judges Griffin and White, with Judge McKeague dissenting in part) largely affirmed the district court on January 4, 2019. The Sixth Circuit agreed that the plaintiffs had stated a claim for harm to bodily integrity against officials who were not entitled to qualified immunity, although it dismissed the claims against other officials against whom the plaintiffs had alleged only negligence. The Sixth Circuit also determined that Flint was not an &ldquo;arm of the state,&rdquo; which could have conferred additional immunity on some officials, despite the city being run by an emergency manager. 912 F.3d 907. The appellate court denied a petition for rehearing en banc. 912 F.3d 907.</p>\r\n<p>The case returned to the district court, but on August 14, 2019, the City of Flint filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States. The city challenged the Sixth Circuit's decision to expand the right to bodily integrity to protection from exposure to environmental toxins. The city also requested review of whether it was plausible that the decisions of government officials acting with the approval of regulatory enforcers and the advice of experts can be found to be conscience-shocking. For the claim against the city defendants to pass the <em>Twombly </em>plausibility standard, the plaintiffs must have shown how the government&rsquo;s discretionary conduct that deprived them of a constitutionally protected liberty interest was constitutionally repugnant. To do this, the plaintiffs must have alleged conduct that was \"conscience shocking\". Additionally, the city asked the Supreme Court to decide if there was a clearly established constitutional right. The city argued that even if a bodily integrity violation occurred, it was not clearly established. Finally, the city challenged the ruling that a municipality under complete control of the state is not an \"arm of the state\" and consequently not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity. On January 21, 2020, the Supreme Court denied the petition for a writ of certiorari and declined to hear the case. Supreme Court Case No. 19-205.</p>\r\n<p>After the denial of certiorari, the parties held status conferences at the district court level from March 2020 through January 2022. On March 9, 2022, the court entered a final judgment and order of dismissal with prejudice, implementing a partial settlement for all cases related to the Flint water crisis, including <em>Guertin </em>and others which had not been filed as class actions. For details of the settlement, see <em><a href=\"../../../../case/16508/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">In re Flint Water Cases</a></em> in the Clearinghouse.</p>\r\n<p>On December 21, 2022, Judge Levy consolidated all 90 pending Flint water crisis-related civil cases and captioned them <em><a href=\"../../../../case/16508/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">In re Flint Water Cases</a></em>&nbsp;for pre-trial purposes and ordered that all further filings be docketed on the lead docket, but the docket in this case remained open.</p>\r\n<p>As of March 2023, the case was ongoing.</p>",

    "summary_short": "On June 27, 2016, two residents of Flint who bathed in and consumed lead contaminated water filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The plaintiffs sued various state entities, their employees, and private companies responsible for water testing and feasibility under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and state law. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, sought general, compensatory and punitive damages, an order declaring the conduct unconstitutional, equitable relief and attorney’s fees. The plaintiffs claimed that the failure to provide safe drinking water and deliberate misinformation about the safety of the drinking water constituted state created danger, violation of bodily integrity, and deprivation of contractually created property rights. While the court dismissed most of the plaintiffs' claims, the Sixth Circuit allowed a narrow species of due process claims against individual government employees to proceed, and negligence claims against private companies also survived. The city of Flint appealed to the Supreme Court, seeking review of the decisions on Eleventh Amendment immunity and whether there was a clearly established right to bodily integrity, and whether this right should extend to protection from environmental toxins.  The Supreme Court denied the petition of certiorari.  On March 9, 2022, the district court approved a partial settlement for all cases related to the Flint water crisis, including this one. On December 21, 2022, this case was consolidated with approximately 90 pending Flint water-crisis related civil cases for pre-trial purposes. As of March 2023, the case was ongoing in the district court.",

Plaintiffs Shari Guertin, her minor child \nE. B., and Diogenes Muse-Cleveland allege that at all relevant times they \nwere residents of Flint, Michigan, where defendants caused the lead in \nthe potable water to rise to dangerous levels and then actively concealed \nit  from  residents,  causing  plaintiffs  harm  when  they  consumed  and \nbathed in the water over an extended period of time.  Defendants filed \nmotions to dismiss, and the Court held a hearing on March 27, 2017.  For \nthe reasons set forth below, each motion is granted in part and denied in \npart. \nI.  Background \nPlaintiffs  are  residents  of  Flint,  Michigan,  and  allege  that \ndefendants  are  legally  responsible  for  harm  that  was  caused  when \nplaintiffs  drank  and  bathed  in  water  that  was  contaminated  with \ndangerous levels of lead.  (Dkt. 1 at 4-5.)1  Defendants’ main challenges \nto plaintiffs’ complaint are under Rule 12(b)(1) as a facial challenge to \nsubject matter jurisdiction and Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, \nso the following background is drawn from the complaint in the light most \n                                      \n1 Plaintiffs clarified at the hearing on the motions to dismiss that paragraph sixteen \nof the complaint applies to plaintiff Diogenes Muse-Cleveland.

The defendants \nDefendant City of Flint is where the relevant harms occurred, and \nits officials made some of the decisions that ultimately led to plaintiffs’ \nharms.  (Dkt. 1 at 5.)  Defendant Darnell Earley, Flint’s Emergency \nManager from November 1, 2013, through January 12, 2015, made the \ndecision “to rush the distribution of water from the Flint River without \nproper treatment, including corrosion control.”  (Id.)  Defendant Earley \nmade the decision to switch to Flint River water and made false and \nmisleading statements representing that the water was safe to drink, \neven after he became aware that it was not.  (Id. at 7-8.) \nDefendant  Howard  Croft,  Flint’s  Department  of  Public  Works \nDirector,  and  defendant  Michael  Glasgow,  a  water  treatment  plant \noperator  for  Flint,  knew  that  Flint’s  water  treatment  plant  was \ninadequate,  and  nonetheless  caused  and  allowed  unsafe  water  to  be \ndelivered to Flint’s residents and did not disclose that Flint’s water was \nunsafe.    (Id.  at  6-7.)    Defendant  Croft  also  made  a  number  of  false \n3 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 4 of 101    Pg ID 5542\nstatements about the safety and quality of Flint’s water that he knew to \nbe untrue.  (Id. at 6.) \nDefendant  State  of  Michigan  directs,  controls,  and  operates \ndefendants Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (“MDEQ”) \nand Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (“MDHHS”).  \n(Id.  at  7.)    Defendant  Richard  Snyder,  as  Governor  of  Michigan, \nparticipated in, directed, and facilitated the state’s decision to transition \nFlint’s water source to the Flint River, and participated in, directed, and \nfacilitated  the  state’s  insufficient  response  to  protect  plaintiffs  from \ndefendant State of Michigan’s actions.  (Id.) \nDefendant  Gerald  Ambrose,  Flint’s  Emergency  Manager  from \nJanuary 13, 2015, until April 28, 2015, and a financial advisor regarding \nFlint’s financial emergency from January 2012 until December 2014, was \ninvolved in and directed the state’s decision to transition Flint to Flint \nRiver water, and made false and misleading statements representing \nthat the water was safe to drink.  (Id. at 7-8.) \nDefendant MDEQ is the state agency responsible for implementing \nsafe drinking water laws, rules, and regulations in Michigan.  Defendant \nMDEQ, through its employees, violated the federal Lead and Copper Rule \n4 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 5 of 101    Pg ID 5543\nby failing to require corrosion control for Flint River water, misled the \nfederal Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), conducted illegal and \nimproper sampling of Flint’s water, lied to the public about the safety of \nFlint’s water, and attempted to publicly discredit outside individuals who \noffered independent evidence of the water’s contamination.  (Id. at 8-9.)  \nThese defendants ignored voluminous evidence of the crisis they had \ncreated until the point when their denials could no longer withstand \noutside scrutiny.  (Id. at 9.) \nDefendant Liane Shekter Smith,2 Chief of the Office of Drinking \nWater and Municipal Assistance for MDEQ until she was removed from \nher position on October 19, 2015, knowingly participated in, approved of, \nand caused the decision to transition to Flint River water, and knowingly \ndisseminated false statements to the public that the water was safe to \ndrink, leading to the continued consumption of lead-contaminated water.  \n(Id.) \nDefendant  Daniel  Wyant,  the  Director  of  MDEQ  until  his \nresignation on or about December 29, 2015, participated in, directed, and \n                                      \n2 Plaintiffs incorrectly spelled defendant Liane Shekter Smith’s name as “Liane \nSheckter-Smith” in the case caption, but the Court uses the correct spelling of her \nname in this opinion and order. \n5 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 6 of 101    Pg ID 5544\noversaw defendant MDEQ’s repeated violations of federal water quality \nlaws, failure to properly study and treat Flint River water, and defendant \nMDEQ’s systemic denial, lies, and attempts to discredit outside observers \nwho were publicly reporting that the water in Flint contained dangerous \nlevels of lead.  (Id.)  He knowingly disseminated false statements to the \npublic that led to the continued consumption of lead-contaminated water.  \n(Id. at 9-10.) \nDefendant Stephen Busch, the District Supervisor assigned to the \nLansing  District  Office  of  defendant  MDEQ,  participated  in  MDEQ’s \nrepeated violations of federal water quality laws, the failure to properly \nstudy and treat Flint River water, and defendant MDEQ’s program of \nsystemic denials, lies, and attempts to discredit honest outsiders.  (Id. at \n10.)  He personally falsely reported to the EPA that Flint had enacted an \noptimized corrosion control plan and provided assurances to plaintiffs \nthat the water was safe to drink when he knew that such assurances were \nfalse. (Id.) \nDefendant Patrick Cook, the Water Treatment Specialist assigned \nto the Lansing Community Drinking Water Unit of defendant MDEQ, \nparticipated in, approved, and assented to the decision to allow Flint’s \n6 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 7 of 101    Pg ID 5545\nwater to be delivered to residents without corrosion control or proper \nstudy or testing. (Id. at 10-11.) \nDefendant Michael Prysby, the Engineer assigned to District 11 \n(Genesee County) of MDEQ, participated in, approved, and assented to \nthe decision to switch the water source, failed to properly monitor or test \nthe Flint River water, and provided assurances to plaintiffs that the Flint \nRiver water was safe when he knew those statements to be untrue.  (Id. \nat 11.) \nDefendant  Bradley  Wurfel,  the  Director  of  Communications  for \nMDEQ until he resigned on December 29, 2015, repeatedly denied the \nwater  situation  as  it  unfolded  and  attempted  to  discredit  opposing \nopinions.  (Id. at 11-12.)  He repeatedly made public statements that \ncreated, increased, and prolonged the risks and harms facing plaintiffs, \nwhich he knew were false.  (Id. at 12.)  He was eventually relieved of his \nduties  for  his  “persistent  [negative]  tone  and  derision”  and  his \n“aggressive  dismissal,  belittlement  and  attempts  to  discredit  the \nindividuals involved in [conducting independent studies and tests].”  (Id.) \nDefendant  MDHHS,  through  decision-making  employees, \ndeliberately hid information that would have revealed the public health \n7 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 8 of 101    Pg ID 5546\ncrisis  in  Flint,  which  MDHHS  had  earlier  failed  to  detect.    (Id.)  \nMDHHS’s failure to properly analyze data led it to conclude that there \nwas no increase in lead contamination in Flint’s children, and MDHHS \nresisted and obstructed the efforts of outside researchers and the county \nhealth  department  to  determine  whether  that  was  actually  true  and \ncorrect.  (Id.) \nDefendants  Eden  Wells,  Chief  Medical  Executive  within  the \nPopulation Health and Community Services Department of MDHHS, \nNick Lyon, Director of MDHHS, and Nancy Peeler, an MDHHS employee \nin  charge  of  its  childhood  lead  poisoning  prevention  program, \nparticipated in, directed, and oversaw the Department’s efforts to hide \ninformation to save face and to obstruct the efforts of outside researchers.  \n(Id. at 12-13.)  Defendants Wells and Lyon knew as early as 2014 of \nproblems with lead and legionella contamination in Flint’s water and \nparticipated in hiding this information.  (Id. at 12-13.)  And defendant \nPeeler  continued  to  try  to  generate  evidence  that  there  was  no  lead \ncontamination problem even when her own Department had data that \nverified outside evidence to the contrary.  (Id. at 13.) \n8 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 9 of 101    Pg ID 5547\nDefendant Robert Scott, at all relevant times Data Manager for \nMDHHS’s  Healthy  Homes  and  Lead  Prevention  Program,  also \nparticipated in, directed, and oversaw the Department’s efforts to hide \ninformation to save face and actively sought to obstruct and discredit the \nefforts of outside researchers.  (Id. at 14.)  And he continued to try to \ngenerate evidence that there was no lead contamination problem even \nwhen his own Department had data that verified outside evidence to the \ncontrary.    (Id.)    He  served  a  key  role  in  withholding  and  delaying \ndisclosure  of  data  that  outside  researchers  needed  to  conduct \nindependent research.  (Id.) \nDefendant  Veolia  North  America,  LLC,  a  Delaware  corporation \nwith  its  principal  office  in  Illinois,  provided  negligent  professional \nengineering services in reviewing Flint’s water system and declaring the \nwater safe to drink.  (Id. at 14-15.)  Defendant Lockwood, Andrews & \nNewnam, Inc., a Texas corporation with its principal office in Texas, \nprovided negligent professional engineering services in preparing Flint’s \nwater treatment facility to treat water from the Flint River.  (Id. at 15.) \n9 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 10 of 101    Pg ID 5548\nb. The events \nUnder the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, the EPA is responsible \nfor  setting  rules  regulating  drinking  water,  including  the  Lead  and \nCopper Rule.  (Id.)  Put simply, the law requires sampling of public water \nsystems, and when results indicate that lead is present at levels that \nexceed the lead action level set in the Lead and Copper Rule, water \nsystems are required to notify the public, the state, and the EPA of the \nlead action level “exceedance.”  When the levels have the potential to \ncause serious adverse health effects from short-term exposure, the water \nsystem must issue the notifications within twenty-four hours.  See 42 \nU.S.C. § 300g-3(c)(2)(C); 40 C.F.R. § 141.80(c). \nIn  2010,  the  EPA  commissioned  a  report  noting,  among  other \nthings, that defendant MDEQ’s practice of calculating the amount of lead \nin water “does not meet the requirements of Federal Regulations, since \nit is required that all 90th percentiles be calculated,” something MDEQ \nwould not do unless a potential violation had been identified.  (Dkt. 1 at \n18.)  The report also noted that MDEQ did not conduct the required \nnumber of water samples for lead.  (Id.)  Defendant MDEQ also violated \n“the letter and spirit” of the Lead and Copper Rule by failing to require \n10 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 11 of 101    Pg ID 5549\ncorrosion control for Flint River water and by misinforming the EPA \nabout whether corrosion control was being utilized.  (Id. at 19.)  MDEQ’s \nformer director “explicitly admitted” that the state agency did not follow \nthe rule.  (Id. at 20.) \nIn November 2012, Flint’s Emergency Manager suggested joining \nthe Karegnondi Water Authority to save costs.  (Id.)  On March 7, 2014, \ndefendant  Earley  sent  a  letter  to  the  Detroit  Water  and  Sewerage \nDepartment  from  which  Flint  had  been  receiving  its  water  supply, \nstating “[w]e expect that the Flint Water Treatment Plant will be fully \noperational and capable of treating Flint River water prior to the date of \ntermination.  In that case, there will be no need for Flint to continue \npurchasing water to serve its residents and businesses after April 17, \n2014.”    (Id.  at  21.)    On  March  26,  2014,  defendant  Busch  e-mailed \ndefendant Shekter Smith and another colleague stating that starting up \nthe Flint plant “for continuous operation will carry significant changes in \nregulatory  requirements  so  there  is  a  very  gray  area  as  to  what  we \nconsider for startup.”  (Id. at 22.) \nHowever, defendant Glasgow informed defendant MDEQ on April \n17, 2014, that he “assumed there would be dramatic changes to [MDEQ’s] \n11 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 12 of 101    Pg ID 5550\nmonitoring” and did “not anticipate giving the OK to begin sending water \nout anytime soon.  If water is distributed from this plant in the next \ncouple of weeks, it w[ould] be against [his] direction.  [He] need[ed] time \nto adequately train additional staff and to update [MDEQ’s] monitoring \nplans before [he would] feel [MDEQ was] ready.”  (Id. at 22.)  According \nto Glasgow, “management above” seemed “to have their own agenda.”  \n(Id.) \nOn April 25, 2014, Flint officially began using the Flint River as its \nprimary water source, despite the fact that the proper preparations had \nnot been made and defendant Glasgow’s clear warning to the contrary.  \n(Id. at 23.)  Defendant Croft stated in a press release that “[t]he test \nresults have shown that our water is not only safe, but of the high quality \nthat Flint customers have come to expect.”  (Id.) \nWhen Flint was receiving its water from the Detroit Water and \nSewerage Department, it was already treated to prevent corrosion, but \nthe water from the Flint River was not.  (Id. at 24.)  Defendant Lockwood \nwas hired to make Flint’s plant sufficient to treat water from its new \nsource.  (Id.)  Defendants State of Michigan, MDEQ, and Lockwood did \nnot implement any corrosion control for the new water source, which it \n12 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 13 of 101    Pg ID 5551\nrequired due to the lead pipes in Flint’s water system.  (Id. at 24-26.)  \nDefendants were put on notice that this was an issue when residents of \nFlint  began  complaining  almost  immediately  about  discoloration  and \nodor, among other things.  (Id. at 26.) \nIn  August  and  September  2014,  Flint  issued  two  boil-water \nadvisories after fecal coliform bacteria was discovered in the water.  (Id. \nat 27.)  On October 13, 2014, General Motors ceased using Flint River \nwater at its engine plant because the company determined that high \nlevels of chloride would corrode its car parts.  Discussing General Motors’ \ndecision, defendant Prysby wrote to defendants Busch, Shekter Smith, \nand others that the Flint River water had elevated chloride levels that \n“although not optimal” were “satisfactory.”  (Id. at 28.)  He “stressed the \nimportance  of  not  branding  Flint’s water  as  ‘corrosive’  from  a  public \nhealth  standpoint  simply  because  it  does  not  meet  a  manufacturing \nfacility’s limit for production.”  (Id.) \nIn October of 2014, defendant Snyder received a briefing in which \nofficials blamed iron pipes, susceptible to corrosion and bacteria, for the \ntwo boil-water advisories.  (Id.)  On January 2, 2015, Flint mailed a notice \nto its water customers indicating that the city had been in violation of the \n13 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 14 of 101    Pg ID 5552\nSafe Drinking Water Act due to the presence of trihalomethanes, which \nwas a result of attempts to disinfect the water.  (Id.)  And on January 9, \n2015,  the  University  of  Michigan–Flint  discovered  lead  in  the  water \ncoming out of campus drinking fountains.  (Id.) \nAs  early  as  January  2015,  defendant  State  of  Michigan  began \nproviding purified water coolers at its Flint offices for state employees in \nresponse  to  concerns  about  the  drinking  water,  while  government \nofficials, including many defendants, continued to tell Flint residents \nthat the water was safe to drink.  (Id.)  On January 12, 2015, the Detroit \nWater and Sewerage Department offered to waive a four-million dollar \nreconnection fee to transition Flint back to water provided by the Detroit \nWater and Sewerage Department.  Defendant Ambrose, as Emergency \nManager, declined the offer.  (Id.) \nOn January 29, 2015, defendant Shekter Smith emailed MDEQ \ndeputy  director  Jim  Sygo  that  a  “change  in  water  chemistry  can \nsometimes cause more corrosive water to slough material off of pipes as \nopposed  to  depositing  material  or  coating  pipes  in  the  distribution \nsystem,” and that this “may continue for a while until things stabilize.”  \n14 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 15 of 101    Pg ID 5553\n(Id. at 29.)  She noted that because “it appears wide-spread, it’s most \nlikely a distribution system problem.”  (Id.) \nOn February 6, 2015, an Emergency Manager staff member wrote \nto defendant Prysby, asking whether he knew if defendant MDEQ had \never conducted a “source water assessment” for the Flint River.  (Id.)  \nAfter  an  initial  response  stating  that  he  did  not  know,  Prysby  later \nresponded that a study on the Flint River as an emergency intake had \nbeen conducted in 2004.  The 2004 study noted that the Flint River was \na highly sensitive drinking water source susceptible to contamination.  \n(Id.) \nOn February 27, 2015, in response to concerns about dangerously \nhigh levels of lead in a resident’s water sample, defendant Busch told the \nEPA on behalf of defendant MDEQ that the Flint Water Treatment Plant \nhad an optimized corrosion control program, despite knowing it did not.  \n(Id.)  In an email to defendants Prysby and Busch, the EPA’s regional \ndrinking water regulations manager Miguel Del Toral noted high levels \nof particulate lead in the water sample, and inquired about optimized \ncorrosion control.  (Id. at 30.)  He relayed that defendant MDEQ’s testing \nmethod—flushing the line before compliance sampling—impermissibly \n15 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 16 of 101    Pg ID 5554\nskewed the test results to show fewer lead particles than were generally \npresent.  (Id.) \nDuring this time, an email from an employee in defendant MDEQ \nnoted that the switch to the Flint River “put the city in the business of \nwater production, where they had historically been in the business of \nwater transmission,” stating that “once the city connects to the new KWA \nsystem in 2016, this issue w[ould] fade into the rearview.”  (Id. at 31.)  \nAlso during this time, defendant Veolia was hired to review Flint’s public \nwater system, including treatment processes, maintenance procedures, \nand actions taken.  (Id.)  Veolia issued an interim report on February 18, \n2015, stating that Flint’s water was “in compliance with drinking water \nstandards,” and noting that “[s]afe [meant] complian[t] with state and \nfederal standards and required testing.”  (Id.)  Veolia dismissed medical \nconcerns by stating that “[s]ome people may be sensitive to any water.”  \n(Id. at 32.) \nDefendant Veolia issued its final report on March 12, 2015, stating \nthat “a review of water quality records for the time period under our \nstudy  indicates  compliance  with  State  and  Federal  water  quality \n16 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 17 of 101    Pg ID 5555\nregulations.”  (Id.)  Veolia recommended that adding polyphosphate to \nthe water would minimize discoloration.  (Id.) \nOn April 24, 2015, defendant MDEQ stated to the EPA that Flint \ndid not have optimized corrosion control in place, contradicting MDEQ’s \nprevious statement made two months prior.  (Id. at 33.)  That same \nmonth,  EPA  regional  drinking  water  manager  Del  Toral  issued  a \nmemorandum to the MDEQ, stating: \nI wanted to follow up on this because Flint has essentially not \nbeen using any corrosion control treatment since April 30, \n2014, and they have (lead service lines).  Given the very high \nlead levels found at one home and the pre-flushing happening \nin Flint, I’m worried that the whole town may have much \nhigher lead levels than the compliance results indicated, since \nthey  are  using  pre-flushing  ahead  of  their  compliance \nsampling. \n(Id. at 34.)  On May 1, 2015, defendant Cook responded that “[a]s Flint \nwill be switching raw water sources in just over one year from now, raw \nwater quality will be completely different than what they currently use.  \nRequiring a study at the current time will be of little to no value in the \nlong term control of these chronic contaminants.”  (Id. at 35.) \n  On June 24, 2015, Del Toral sent a memorandum to the chief of the \nEPA’s Region 5 Ground Water and Drinking Water Branch, and included \n17 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 18 of 101    Pg ID 5556\non the email defendants Shekter Smith, Cook, Busch, and Prysby.  (Id. \nat 35-36.)  He expressed concern at the lead levels and lack of mitigating \ntreatment,  detailing  Lee-Anne  Walters’  experience.    Walters  had \ncontacted the EPA with the lead-level results in her potable water, which \ndefendant MDEQ had told her was coming from the plumbing in her own \nhome.  (Id. at 36.)  Del Toral’s inspection revealed that her plumbing was \nentirely plastic and noted that blood tests showed her child had elevated \nblood lead levels.  (Id.) \nOn July 9, 2015, ACLU-Michigan reporter Curt Guyette publicly \nbroke the story about lead in Flint’s drinking water, citing Del Toral’s \nMemorandum  and  exposing  the  lack  of  corrosion  control  in  Flint’s \ndrinking water.  Defendant Wurfel responded:  “Let me start here—\nanyone who is concerned about lead in the drinking water in Flint can \nrelax.”  (Id. at 38.) \nOn  August  27,  2015,  Virginia  Tech  Professor  Marc  Edwards \nreleased an analysis of lead levels in homes he sampled in Flint.  More \nthan half of the samples came back above 5 parts-per-billion, and more \nthan 30% of them came back over 15 ppb, which would be unacceptable \neven at the 90th percentile.  (Id. at 40-41.)  In September 2015, Professor \n18 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 19 of 101    Pg ID 5557\nEdwards published a report of his findings.  (Id. at 42-43.)  Defendant \nWurfel made a number of statements to qualify, distinguish, or otherwise \ndownplay these results.  (Id. at 41-42, 43-44.) \nOn September 17, 2015, defendant Wyant wrote a letter in response \nto an inquiry from various legislators, stating that “the MDEQ does not \nreview or receive draft memos from the USEPA, nor would we expect to \nwhile it is a draft,” despite the memorandum it had received months \nearlier from Del Toral.  (Id. at 46.)  On September 23, 2015, defendant \nCroft sent an email to numerous officials stating that “Flint has officially \nreturned to compliance with the Michigan Safe Drinking Water Act,” \nrecent “testing has raised questions regarding the amount of lead that is \nbeing found in the water,” and “over one hundred and sixty lead tests \n[have been performed] throughout the city since switching over to the \nFlint River and remain within EPA standards.”  (Id.) \nOn July 28, 2015, MDHHS epidemiologist Cristin Larder emailed \ndefendant Peeler and MDHHS employee Patricia McKane, noting an \nincrease in blood lead levels in Flint residents just after the switch and \nconcluding that the issue “warrant[ed] further investigation.”  (Id. at 48.)  \n19 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 20 of 101    Pg ID 5558\nDefendant  Peeler  responded  by  attributing  the  increase  to  seasonal \nvariation.  (Id.) \nOn September 24, 2015, Dr. Hanna-Attisha presented the results \nfrom her study at a press conference, which showed post-water transition \nelevation of blood-lead levels in Flint children.  (Id. at 50.)  MDHHS \nemployees “were uniformly dismissive of Dr. Hanna-Attisha’s results.”  \n(Id.)  But the day after Dr. Hanna-Attisha released her study, the City of \nFlint issued a health advisory, telling residents to flush pipes and install \nfilters to prevent lead poisoning.  (Id. at 51.) \nOn September 28, 2015, defendant Wurfel publicly stated that he \n“wouldn’t  call  [Dr.  Hanna-Attisha’s  statements]  irresponsible.    [He] \nwould call them unfortunate.”  And he again declared Flint’s water safe \nto drink.  (Id. at 53.)  The same day, defendant Lyon stated that he “would \nlike to make a strong statement with a demonstration of proof that the \nlead blood levels seen are not out of the ordinary and are attributable to \nseasonal fluctuations.”  (Id. at 54.) \nPlaintiffs  cite  numerous  inter-  and  intra-department \ncommunications, alleging they show attempts to cover up the issue.  (Id. \nat 54-58.)  By October 12, 2015, defendant Snyder received a proposal to \n20 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 21 of 101    Pg ID 5559\nreconnect Flint to the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department.  And on \nOctober 16, 2015, Flint reconnected to the Detroit Water and Sewerage \nDepartment.    This  did  not  change  the  corrosion  that  had  already \noccurred, and lead has continued to leach from pipes into the water.  (Id. \nat 58.) \nOn October 18, 2015, defendant Wyant stated to defendant Snyder:  \n[S]taff made a mistake while working with the City of Flint.  \nSimply  stated,  staff  employed  a  federal  (corrosion  control) \ntreatment protocol they believed was appropriate, and it was \nnot. . . .  I believe now we made a mistake.  For communities \nwith a population above 50,000, optimized corrosion control \nshould have been required from the beginning.  Because of \nwhat  I  have  learned,  I  will  be  announcing  a  change  in \nleadership in our drinking water program. \n(Id. at 58-59.) \nOn October 21, 2015, defendant Snyder appointed a task force to \ninvestigate the Flint water crisis.  (Id. at 59.)  On December 29, 2015, the \ntask  force  issued  a  letter  detailing  its  findings:    “Although  many \nindividuals and entities at state and local levels contributed to creating \nand  prolonging  the  problem,”  the  “primary  responsibility  for  what \nhappened  in  Flint  rests  with  the  [MDEQ].  .  .  .    It  failed  in  that \nresponsibility and must be held accountable for that failure.”  (Id. at 59-\n21 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 22 of 101    Pg ID 5560\n60.)  Among other things, the task force found that “the agency’s response \nwas  often  one  of  aggressive  dismissal,  belittlement,  and  attempts  to \ndiscredit [outside, independent] efforts and the individuals involved,” and \n“the MDEQ seems to have been more determined to discredit the work of \nothers—who  ultimately  proved  to  be  right—than  to  pursue  its  own \noversight responsibility.”  (Id. at 60.)  The task force stated “we are \nparticularly concerned by recent revelations of MDHHS’s apparent early \nknowledge of, yet silence about, elevated blood lead levels detected among \nFlint’s children.”  (Id. at 61.) \nIn October 2015, defendant Shekter Smith was reassigned so as to \nhave  no  continued  oversight  responsibility  regarding  Flint’s  drinking \nwater.    On  December  5,  2015,  the  City  of  Flint  declared  a  state  of \nemergency.    On  December  23,  2015,  the  Michigan  Auditor  General \nprovided  an  investigative  report  on  the  crisis,  finding  that  corrosion \ncontrol  should  have  been  maintained  from  the  beginning  and  that \nimproper  sample  sites  had  been  selected  by  defendant  MDEQ.    On \nDecember 30, 2015, defendants Wyant and Wurfel resigned.  (Id.)  On \nJanuary 4, 2016, Genesee County declared its own state of emergency.  \n(Id. at 62.) \n22 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 23 of 101    Pg ID 5561\nOn  January  21,  2016,  Susan  Hedman,  former  EPA  Region  5 \nAdministrator, resigned over her involvement in the Flint Water crisis.3  \nThat same day, the EPA issued an Emergency Order, based on its finding \nthat “the City of Flint’s and the State of Michigan’s responses to the \ndrinking water crisis in Flint have been inadequate to protect public \nhealth and that these failures continue.”  (Id. at 62.)  At one of the several \nhearings conducted before the U.S. Congress, the EPA Deputy Assistant \nAdministrator testified: \n[Defendant] MDEQ incorrectly advised the City of Flint that \ncorrosion-control treatment was not necessary, resulting in \nleaching of lead into the city’s drinking water . . . .  EPA \nregional staff urged MDEQ to address the lack of corrosion \ncontrol,  but  was  met  with  resistance.    The  delays  in \nimplementing the actions needed to treat the drinking water \nand in informing the public of ongoing health risks raise very \nserious concerns. \n(Id. at 64.) \n                                      \n3 In paragraph forty-three, plaintiffs state that Hedman could not yet be named as a \ndefendant pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act, but that if their anticipated \nFTCA claims to the EPA were rejected, they might seek to amend their complaint in \norder to add claims against Hedman.  (Dkt. 1 at 14.)  Plaintiffs clarified at the hearing \nthat this was a drafting mistake; plaintiffs have not filed an FTCA administrative \nclaim, and they have otherwise taken no action to bring suit against Hedman, nor do \nthey intend to. \n23 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 24 of 101    Pg ID 5562\nOn January 22, 2016, defendants Shekter Smith and Busch were \nsuspended  without  pay.

In Count 1—against defendants City \nof Flint, Croft, Glasgow, State of Michigan, Snyder, Earley, Ambrose, \nMDEQ,  Shekter  Smith,  Wyant,  Busch,  Cook,  Prysby,  and  Wurfel—\nplaintiffs bring a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim, alleging a deprivation of a \ncontractually  created  property  right  in  violation  of  substantive  due \nprocess.  According to plaintiffs, these defendants violated their property \nright “when, ceasing to provide [p]laintiffs with safe, potable water, they \nprovided [p]laintiffs with poisonous, contaminated water.”  (Id. at 64-65.) \n  In Count 2— against defendants City of Flint, Croft, Glasgow, State \nof Michigan, Snyder, Earley, Ambrose, MDEQ, Shekter Smith, Wyant, \nBusch,  Cook,  Prysby,  and  Wurfel—plaintiffs  bring  a  §  1983  claim, \nalleging  a  deprivation  of  a  contractually  created  property  right  in \nviolation  of  procedural  due  process.

According to plaintiffs, these defendants each acted to expose \nthem to toxic, lead-contaminated water by making, causing to be made, \nand/or causing or making representations that the water was safe to \ndrink, and these actions and omissions were objectively unreasonable in \nlight of the facts and circumstances confronting them, in violation of \nplaintiffs’ Fourteenth Amendment rights.

(Id. at 88.) \nII.  Standard \na. Rule 12(b)(1) \n“Motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction fall into \ntwo general categories:  facial attacks and factual attacks.”  United States \nv. Ritchie, 15 F.3d 592, 598 (6th Cir. 1994).  Relevant here, “[a] facial \nattack  is  a  challenge  to  the  sufficiency  of  the  pleading  itself.”    Id. \n(emphasis in original).  When considering a facial attack, “the court must \ntake the material allegations of the [complaint] as true and construed in \nthe light most favorable to the nonmoving party.”  Id. \n30 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 31 of 101    Pg ID 5569\nTo survive such an attack, “the plaintiff’s burden to prove federal \nquestion subject matter jurisdiction is not onerous.”  Musson Theatrical, \nInc. v. Fed. Express Corp., 89 F.3d 1244, 1248 (6th Cir. 1996) (citing RMI \nTitanium Co. v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 78 F.3d 1125, 1134 (6th Cir. \n1996)).  “The plaintiff must show only that the complaint alleges a claim \nunder federal law, and that the claim is ‘substantial.’”  Id.  “[T]he plaintiff \ncan survive the motion by showing any arguable basis in law for the claim \nmade.”  Id.  “Dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction because of \nthe inadequacy of the federal claim is proper only when the claim is ‘so \ninsubstantial, implausible, foreclosed by prior decisions of [the Supreme \nCourt], or otherwise completely devoid of merit as not to involve a federal \ncontroversy.’”  Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 89 \n(1998) (quoting Oneida Indian Nation of New York v. Cty. of Oneida, 414 \nU.S. 661, 666 (1974)). \nb. Rule 12(b)(6) \nWhen  deciding  a  motion  to  dismiss  under  Rule  12(b)(6)  of  the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court must “construe the complaint \nin the light most favorable to the plaintiff and accept all allegations as \ntrue.”  Keys v. Humana, Inc., 684 F.3d 605, 608 (6th Cir. 2012).  “To \n31 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 32 of 101    Pg ID 5570\nsurvive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual \nmatter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its \nface.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  A plausible claim need \nnot contain “detailed factual allegations,” but it must contain more than \n“labels and conclusions” or “a formulaic recitation of the elements of a \ncause of action.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007). \nIII.  Analysis \nBecause  defendants  challenge  the  sufficiency  of  plaintiffs’ \ncomplaint  on  both  subject-matter  jurisdiction  and  sufficiency-of-the \npleadings grounds, the Court first addresses defendants’ jurisdictional \narguments. \na. Whether the Court has subject-matter jurisdiction \ni.  Standing \nDefendants  Lockwood  and  Scott  argue  that  plaintiffs  fail  to \nestablish  Article  III  standing,  and  thus  the  complaint  should  be \ndismissed under Rule 12(b)(1).  (See, e.g., Dkt. 59 at 15-16; see Dkt. 96 at \n49.)    Specifically,  they  argue  that  plaintiffs  only  plead  they  were \n“‘damaged’ or ‘injured’ in some unspecified way,” and that failing to plead \nthat  “their  blood  lead  levels  are  even  elevated,  just  that  they  were \n32 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 33 of 101    Pg ID 5571\nexposed to lead-contaminated water,” is insufficient to plead a concrete \ninjury.  (See, e.g., Dkt. 59 at 16-17.)   \nThis argument is frivolous.  At the beginning of the complaint, \nplaintiffs allege that they all consumed lead-conftaminated water, that \nthe water was contaminated with lead because of defendants’ actions, \nand that they suffered injuries including hair, skin, digestive, and organ \nproblems;  physical  pain  and  suffering;  disability;  brain  and \ndevelopmental injuries including cognitive deficits; and aggravation of \npre-existing  conditions.    (Dkt.  1  at  4-5.)    There  is  no  question  that \nplaintiffs sufficiently pleaded a “concrete and particularized” injury, they \n“suffered an injury in fact,” there is “a causal connection between the \ninjury and the conduct complained of,” and a favorable decision from this \nCourt would likely redress plaintiffs’ injury.  Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, \n504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992).  Accordingly, the motions to dismiss based \non plaintiffs’ failure to plead a concrete injury is denied.   \nii.  Preemption \nDefendants against whom the four § 1983 claims are made—all \ndefendants except for Veolia and Lockwood—argue that the federal Safe \nDrinking Water Act (“SDWA” or “Act”) has a comprehensive remedial \n33 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 34 of 101    Pg ID 5572\nscheme that preempts plaintiffs’ federal claims.  (See Dkts. 52 at 17, 69 \nat 25, 70 at 24, 96 at 25, 102 at 35, 103 at 23, 105 at 15.) \nPlaintiffs  allege  that  the  state  violated  their  substantive  and \nprocedural due process rights to property created by a contract for water \nwith the city and state, their substantive due process right to be free from \na state-created danger, and their substantive due process right to bodily \nintegrity.  According to defendants, the SDWA provides the exclusive \nremedy for claims based on unsafe public drinking water.  (See, e.g., Dkt. \n103  at  24.)    They  argue  that  the  Act’s  remedial  scheme  is  so \ncomprehensive  that  Congress  intended  the  Act  to  preempt  all  other \nfederal remedies, including constitutional claims brought under § 1983. \nPlaintiffs  respond  that  defendants  apply  the  wrong  preemption \nanalysis,  that  which  applies  to  §  1983  claims  for  federal  statutory \nviolations, but the correct test here is that which applies to § 1983 claims \nfor violations of the Constitution.  (See Dkt. 123 at 24.)  Plaintiffs argue \nthat because the contours of the rights afforded under the Constitution \nare substantially different from those under the SDWA, Congress did not \nintend the enforcement scheme in the SDWA to displace constitutional \nclaims under § 1983.  (Id. at 24-31.) \n34 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 35 of 101    Pg ID 5573\nWhen  Congress  intends  a  statute’s  remedial  scheme  to  “be  the \nexclusive  avenue  through  which  a  plaintiff  may  assert  [the]  claims,” \n§ 1983 claims are precluded.  Fitzgerald v. Barnstable Sch. Comm., 555 \nU.S. 246, 252 (2009) (quoting Smith v. Robinson, 468 U.S. 992, 1009 \n(1984)).  And when, as here, a § 1983 claim is based on a constitutional \nright, “lack of congressional intent may be inferred from a comparison of \nthe rights and protections of the statute and those existing under the \nConstitution.”  Id.  When “the contours of such rights and protections \ndiverge in significant ways, it is not likely that Congress intended to \ndisplace § 1983 suits enforcing constitutional rights.”  Id. \nAmong the several Supreme Court cases that have addressed the \nissue, this case is in line with those finding that the federal statute does \nnot preempt § 1983 claims for violations of the Constitution. \nIn Smith v. Robinson, the Supreme Court held that the Education \nof  the  Handicapped  Act  preempted  §  1983  due  process  and  equal \nprotection  claims  because  Congress  had  placed  “on  local  and  state \neducational agencies the primary responsibility for developing a plan to \naccommodate the needs of each individual handicapped child,” and “the \nprocedures  and  guarantees  set  out  in  the  [statute]”  were \n35 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 36 of 101    Pg ID 5574\n“comprehensive.”    468  U.S.  992,  1011  (1984).    In  light  “of  the \ncomprehensive nature of the procedures and guarantees set out in” that \nstatute, the Court found “it difficult to believe that Congress also meant \nto leave undisturbed the ability of a handicapped child to go directly to \ncourt  with  an  equal  protection  claim  to  a  free  appropriate  public \neducation.”  Id. \nAnd in Rancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, the Court similarly held \nthat  the  Telecommunications  Act’s  detailed  and  restrictive \nadministrative and judicial remedies “are deliberate and are not to be \nevaded through § 1983.”  544 U.S. 113, 124 (2005).  In both cases, “the \nstatutes at issue required plaintiffs to comply with particular procedures \nand/or to exhaust particular administrative remedies,” and a direct route \nto court through § 1983 “would have circumvented these procedures and \ngiven plaintiffs access to tangible benefits—such as damages, attorney’s \nfees, and costs—that were unavailable under the statutes.”  Fitzgerald, \n555 U.S. at 254. \nIn contrast, the Supreme Court held in Fitzgerald that the relief \navailable under Title IX—withdrawal of federal funding from institutions \nnot in compliance with the law and an implied right of action permitting \n36 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 37 of 101    Pg ID 5575\ninjunctive  relief  and  damages—was  evidence  that  Congress  did  not \nintend  to  preempt  §  1983  claims  based  on  violations  of  the  Equal \nProtection Clause.  Id. at 255.  The Court noted that “we should ‘not \nlightly conclude that Congress intended to preclude reliance on § 1983 as \na remedy for a substantial equal protection claim,’” and declined to do so \nas to Title IX in light of the fact that there was only an implied remedy \nunder the statute and because of the “divergent coverage of Title IX and \nthe Equal Protection Clause.”  Id. at 255-58. \nUnder  the  SDWA,  the  states  are  charged  with  “primary \nenforcement  responsibility.”    See  42  U.S.C.  §  300g-2.    And  the \nAdministrator of the EPA can sue in federal court for civil penalties of up \nto $25,000 for each day in which the statute or regulations are violated.  \nId. at § 300g-3. \nThere  is  a  citizen-suit  provision  as  well.    “[A]ny  person  may \ncommence a civil action on his own behalf . . . against any person . . . who \nis alleged to be in violation of any requirement prescribed by or under” \nthe Act.  42 U.S.C. § 300j-8(a)(1).  District courts have jurisdiction “to \nenforce  in  an  action  brought  under  this  subsection  any  requirement \nprescribed by or under this title or to order the Administrator to perform \n37 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 38 of 101    Pg ID 5576\nan act” that is non-discretionary.  Id. at (a)(1)-(2).  The SDWA has been \ninterpreted to provide only for prospective injunctive relief for ongoing \nviolations.  See Mattoon v. City of Pittsfield, 980 F.2d 1, 6-7 (1st Cir. 1992) \n(SDWA only authorizes suit for continuous or intermittent violation, not \nfor past harm); Batton v. Ga. Gulf, 261 F. Supp. 2d 575, 598 (M.D. La. \n2003) (“The defendants nevertheless are correct that the SDWA does not \npermit a private right of action for the recovery of compensatory damages \n. . . .”).  The citizen-suit provision also provides that the Court may award \ncosts and attorney’s fees when appropriate. \nBut the Act includes a robust savings clause:  “Nothing in this \nsection shall restrict any right which any person (or class of persons) may \nhave  under  any  statute  or  common  law  to  seek  enforcement  of  any \nrequirement prescribed by or under this title or to seek any other relief.”  \n42 U.S.C. § 300j-8(d)-(e). \nReading these provisions together, the relevant provisions of the \nAct can be summarized as follows:  the Act is enforced primarily by the \nstates; the Administrator of the EPA may enforce the Act by bringing \ncivil suits and enforcement actions; private citizens may enforce the Act \nby suing anyone in violation of the Act for injunctive relief, costs, and \n38 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 39 of 101    Pg ID 5577\nattorney’s fees; and the Act explicitly does not restrict “any right” under \n“any statute or common law” to enforce any requirement prescribed by \nthe Act or regulations or for “any other relief.” \nAs in Smith, Congress here placed “on local and state [] agencies \nthe  primary  responsibility  for  developing  a  plan  to”  provide  for  and \nenforce the safe drinking water requirements of the SDWA.  468 U.S. at \n1011.  But as in Fitzgerald, the SDWA’s protections are “narrower in \nsome  respects  and  broader  in  others”  than  the  constitutional  claims \nplaintiffs bring here.  See 555 U.S. at 256.  For example, the SDWA \nprovides for citizen suits “against any person . . . who is alleged to be in \nviolation of any requirement prescribed by or under” the Act, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 300j-8(a)(1) (emphasis added), whereas the Constitution only reaches \ngovernment officials and limited classes of private persons acting as the \ngovernment.  See, e.g., Fitzgerald, 555 U.S. at 256.  And the Act requires \nconduct that may give rise to a claim under the SDWA, such as for \nviolation of water quality reporting requirements, that would not likely \ngive rise to constitutional claims. \nOn the other hand, the Court can contemplate conduct related to \ndrinking water that might violate the Constitution, but would not be \n39 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 40 of 101    Pg ID 5578\nproscribed  by  the  Act.    For  example,  allegations  related  to  the  rates \ncharged for water, rather than the quality of water, could conceivably \nform the basis of constitutional claims that the SDWA does not reach; \nsuch might be the case if government officials charged differing rates for \nwater service based on race.  These significant differences in the contours \nof the statutory and constitutional rights and protections suggest that \nCongress did not intend to preempt constitutional claims under § 1983. \nAnd the savings clause is explicit evidence that Congress did not \nmean to preempt the constitutional claims in this case.  Defendants argue \nthat the savings clause is only meant to apply to “any remedy available \nunder state law,” and a parallel savings clause in Rancho Palos Verdes \ndid  not  prevent  the  Supreme  Court  from  finding  that  the \nTelecommunications Act preempted the § 1983 claims in that case.  (See, \ne.g., Dkt. 102 at 15 n.4 (emphasis in original).) \nBut that holding of Rancho Palos Verde does not apply here.  In that \ncase, the Supreme Court held that the savings clause did not “save” the \n§ 1983 constitutional claim because any § 1983 claim that could have \nbeen brought before the operation of the Telecommunications Act was \npreserved.  See Rancho Palos Verdes, 544 U.S. at 126 (the savings clause \n40 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 41 of 101    Pg ID 5579\n“has no effect on § 1983 whatsoever . . . .  [T]he claims available under \n§ 1983 prior to the enactment of the TCA continue to be available after \nits  enactment”).    In  contrast,  finding  preemption  in  this  case  would \ncertainly affect, for example, plaintiffs’ § 1983 bodily integrity claim, \nwhich  would  have  been  available  before  the  SDWA  but  no  longer  if \npreemption applies. \nAllowing  plaintiffs’  constitutional  claims  to  proceed  would  not \n“circumvent” the SDWA’s “procedures and give access to tangible benefits \n. . . that were unavailable under” the Act.  Fitzgerald, 555 U.S. at 254.  \nThe procedural requirements for seeking remedies available under the \nSDWA  still  apply  to  claims  for  violations  of  the  SDWA,  because,  as \nCongress  intended,  the  SDWA  preempts  §  1983  claims  for  statutory \nviolations of the Act.  The SDWA’s notice requirements must be satisfied \nbefore bringing suit under the Act:  before bringing suit to enforce the \nprovisions of the SDWA, plaintiffs must give sixty days’ notice of SDWA \nviolations to the Administrator, the alleged violators, and to the state.  42 \nU.S.C. § 300j-8(b)(1)(A).  If the Administrator, the Department of Justice, \nor the state “is diligently prosecuting a civil action in federal court,” \n41 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 42 of 101    Pg ID 5580\nplaintiffs may not bring a suit to enforce the Act, but may “intervene as a \nmatter of right.”  Id. at § 300j-8(b)(1)(B). \nBut the procedural requirements and remedial restrictions under \nthe Act are not intended to preempt § 1983 claims for violations of the \nConstitution.  The “protections guaranteed by the two sources of law” are \n“narrower in some respects and broader in others,” Fitzgerald, 555 U.S. \nat 256, and Congress explicitly included a robust savings clause that \npreserves the constitutional claims in this case.  Because the SDWA does \nnot preempt plaintiffs’ constitutional claims, they must be addressed on \nthe merits.  See, e.g., Rietcheck v. City of Arlington, No. 04-CV-1239-BR, \n2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1490, at *10 (D. Or. Jan. 4, 2006) (“Plaintiffs here \n. . . bring their First Claim under § 1983 to enforce their constitutional \nrights to be free from state-created danger, which is an entirely different \nkind of claim and is only tangentially related to safe drinking water.  The \nCourt, therefore, concludes Plaintiffs’ First Claim brought under § 1983 \nis not preempted by the SDWA because Plaintiffs do not seek to vindicate \nany right addressed by the SDWA.”).4 \n                                      \n4 On February 2, 2017, in Mays v. Snyder, now assigned to this Court, Judge John \nCorbett O’Meara found the opposite.  See Mays v. Snyder, No. 15-14002, 2017 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 14274, at *11 (E.D. Mich. Feb. 2, 2017).

Eleventh Amendment Immunity \nThe governmental defendants, i.e., all defendants except for Veolia \nand  Lockwood,  argue  that  the  Eleventh  Amendment  bars  plaintiffs’ \nclaims against the State of Michigan, state agencies, and state officials \nin the official capacities, as well as the City of Flint and city defendants \nin their official capacities, who would not generally be protected by the \nEleventh Amendment, because they were acting as an arm of the state.  \n(See Dkts. 52 at 21, 69 at 25, 70 at 24, 96 at 46, 102 at 31, 103 at 27, 105 \nat 14.)  “Eleventh Amendment immunity constitutes a jurisdictional bar, \nand unless [it] is expressly waived, a state and its agencies may not be \nsued for damages and injunctive relief in federal court.” Pennhurst State \n  \nSch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 100-01 (1984). \nBecause  the  city  defendants  (City  of  Flint,  the  emergency \nmanagers, and other municipal employees of the city) were not acting as \nan  arm  of  the  state,  they  are  not  entitled  to  Eleventh  Amendment \nImmunity.  Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. \n274, 280 (1977) (“The bar of the Eleventh Amendment to suit in federal \n                                      \nThis Court declined to stay this case sua sponte until the Court of Appeals issues its \nopinion and order. \n43 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 44 of 101    Pg ID 5582\ncourts extends to States and state officials in appropriate circumstances, \n. . . but does not extend to counties and similar municipal corporations.  \nThe issue here thus turns on whether the [municipality] is to be treated \nas an arm of the State partaking of the State’s Eleventh Amendment \nimmunity, or is instead to be treated as a municipal corporation or other \npolitical  subdivision  to  which  the  Eleventh  Amendment  does  not \nextend.”) (internal citations omitted).  To determine whether the city \ndefendants  are  an  arm  of  the  state,  the  following  factors  must  be \nconsidered: \n(1) the State’s potential liability for a judgment against the \nentity; (2) the language by which state statutes and state \ncourts refer to the entity and the degree of state control and \nveto power over the entity’s actions; (3) whether state or local \nofficials  appoint  the  board  members  of  the  entity;  and  (4) \nwhether  the  entity’s  functions  fall  within  the  traditional \npurview of state or local government. \nKreipke v. Wayne State Univ., 807 F.3d 768, 775 (6th Cir. 2015) (quoting \nErnst v. Rising, 427 F.3d 351, 359 (6th Cir. 2005)).  The first factor is “the \nforemost factor” and given substantial weight.  Id. at 776. \nAs to the first factor, the City of Flint, and not Michigan, would be \nliable  for  any  judgment  entered  against  it  while  under  emergency \nmanagement.  MICH. COMP. LAWS § 141.1560(5) (funds “shall be paid out \n44 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 45 of 101    Pg ID 5583\nof  the  funds  of  the  local  government  that  is  or  was  subject  to  the \nreceivership  administered  by  that  emergency  manager”).    The  city \ndefendants argue that they are arms of the state under MICH. COMP. \nLAWS § 600.6458(2), because that provision requires the state to pay the \nliabilities of an “arm of the state” if the arm is unable to pay, but this \nassumes the conclusion.  That the state may be on the hook for judgments \nagainst arms of the state does not make the City of Flint an arm of the \nstate.  Because this first prong weighs heavily against finding that the \nCity of Flint is an arm of the state, the city defendants must make a \nshowing that this “near-determinative factor” is outweighed by the other \nthree factors.  See Pucci v. Nineteenth Dist. Court, 628 F.3d 752, 761 (6th \nCir. 2010). \nBut the second factor, regarding who between the city and state has \nthe most control over the provision of water services, also weighs against \nfinding that the City of Flint was an arm of the state.  The city defendants \nargue  that  the  state  stripped  them  of  home  rule  by  appointing  an \nemergency manager, but under state law, an emergency manager is a \nmunicipal  agent  and  thus  not  subject  to  the  protections  of  Eleventh \nAmendment Immunity.  See Kincaid v. City of Flint, 311 Mich. App. 76, \n45 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 46 of 101    Pg ID 5584\n87-88 (2015).  The city defendants cannot show that they are an arm of \nthe state, and thus are not protected by the Eleventh Amendment. \nThe state defendants (State of Michigan, state agencies, and state \nofficials in their official capacities) argue that the allegedly injunctive \nrelief plaintiffs seek—repairs to property, a medical monitoring fund, and \na monitor to oversee the water operations of Flint for a period of time \ndeemed appropriate by the Court—is in essence retroactive and thus \nbarred by the Eleventh Amendment.  (See, e.g., Dkt. 103 at 30-31.)  The \nindividual defendants acknowledge that suit is brought against them in \ntheir official and unofficial capacities, but insofar as they are sued in \ntheir  official  capacities,  they  seek  immunity  under  the  Eleventh \nAmendment.  (See, e.g., Dkt. 104 at 14.) \nTo obtain relief against the state, plaintiffs must allege an “ongoing \nviolation  of  federal  law”  and  seek  “relief  properly  characterized  as \nprospective,”  because  the  state  has  not  waived  sovereign  immunity.  \nVerizon Md., Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm’n of Md., 535 U.S. 635, 645 (2002). \nThe  closest  plaintiffs  come  to  pleading  an  ongoing  violation  of \nfederal law in the complaint is alleging that “the damage had been done[,] \nlead has continued to leach from pipes into the water,” and “the water [] \n46 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 47 of 101    Pg ID 5585\ncontinues to poison them.”  (See Dkt. 1 at 44, 58.)  Even accepting, as \nplaintiffs argued at the hearing, that defendants continue to violate the \nSDWA and the Lead and Copper Rule (Dkt. 147 at 70), the only remedy \navailable  to  plaintiffs  premised  on  a  violation  of  the  SDWA  and  its \nregulations is the injunctive relief permitted under the SDWA’s citizen-\nsuit provision.  The SDWA preempts actions under § 1983 for statutory \nviolations of the Act.  (See infra at a.ii.) \nIn Concerned Pastors for Social Action v. Khouri, a case brought \nunder the SDWA, the court held that injunctive relief similar to the relief \nplaintiffs seek here was permissible.  194 F. Supp. 3d 589, 603 (E.D. \nMich. 2016).  There, the plaintiffs (Concerned Pastors for Social Action, \nMelissa  Mays,  the  ACLU  of  Michigan,  and  the  Natural  Resources \nDefense Council, Inc.) properly pleaded ongoing violations of the SDWA \nand Lead and Copper Rule due to irreversible damage to Flint’s lead \nservice lines, which thus continued to leach lead into the drinking water.  \nId. at 602-03.  The district court held that it could order the replacement \nof lead service lines, health-risk mitigation, and monitoring, among other \nrelief, because such relief would be prospective injunctive relief to remedy \nthe ongoing violations of the Act and its regulations.  Id. at 603.  The \n47 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 48 of 101    Pg ID 5586\nparties ultimately entered into a comprehensive settlement agreement \nproviding for most of the equitable relief plaintiffs seek in this case and \nmuch  more,  and  the  Court  retains  jurisdiction  to  enforce  it.    See \nConcerned Pastors for Soc. Action v. Khouri, No. 16-cv-10277 (E.D. Mich. \nterminated Mar. 28, 2017) (Dkts. 147, 152, 154). \nEven assuming that plaintiffs have sufficiently pleaded an ongoing \nviolation of constitutional law, as opposed to ongoing violations of the \nSDWA  and  Lead  and  Copper  Rule,  they  seek  “equitable  relief  to \nremediate the harm caused” (id. at 88 (emphasis added)), which is the \nvery relief they are not permitted to seek against the state under the \nEleventh Amendment.  See Verizon Md., Inc., 535 U.S. at 645.  Only when \nthe  fiscal  consequences  to  the  state  are  ancillary  to  a  prospective \ninjunction—for example, enjoining a state from terminating subsistence \nbenefits to indigent individuals without notice and a hearing in violation \nof the Due Process Clause, which undoubtedly results in more money \nbeing paid out of the state fisc, Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 271 \n(1970)—would  such  fiscal  consequences  not  violate  the  Eleventh \nAmendment.  Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 667-68 (1974).  Here, the \nfiscal consequences to the state for paying for property damage or a \n48 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 49 of 101    Pg ID 5587\nmedical  monitoring  fund  are  not  ancillary  to  enjoining  an  ongoing \nviolation of federal law. \nPlaintiffs’ request for an injunction for a monitor to oversee the \nwater operations of Flint for a period of time deemed appropriate by the \nCourt is impermissible for a different reason.  Plaintiffs do not request \nprospective injunctive relief for which such monitor could be ordered to \nprovide oversight.  All that remains without the equitable relief of repairs \nto plaintiffs’ property and a medical monitoring fund is declaratory relief, \ndamages, costs, and fees.  The Court would be ordering a monitor to \noversee water operations in Flint without any accompanying injunction \nagainst the municipality that such monitor would be overseeing, which \nis not relief that this Court can order. \nAccordingly, plaintiffs’ claims as to defendants State of Michigan, \nMDEQ,  MDHHS,  and  the  state,  MDEQ,  and  MDHHS  employee \ndefendants  in  their  official  capacities  only,  must  be  dismissed.    The \nclaims  may  proceed  against  the  city  defendants  in  their  official  and \nindividual capacities and the state official defendants in their individual \ncapacities. \n49 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 50 of 101    Pg ID 5588\niv.  Federal Absolute Immunity \nThe MDEQ employee defendants and defendant Wurfel argue that \nthey  are  absolutely  immune  because  federal  law  authorized  and \ncontrolled  their  actions,  and  the  absolute  immunity  afforded  federal \nofficials should be extended to the state officials here.  (See, e.g., Dkt. 102 \nat 31-32 (citing Butz v. Economou, 438 U.S. 478, 490 (1978)); see Dkt. 70 \nat 27-29.) \nAs  the  case  cited  by  these  defendants  makes  abundantly  clear, \nfederal officials are generally entitled only to qualified immunity.  Butz, \n438 U.S. at 507.  “[I]n a suit for damages arising from unconstitutional \naction, federal executive officials exercising discretion are entitled only \nto [] qualified immunity . . . , subject to those exceptional situations where \nit is demonstrated that absolute immunity is essential for the conduct of \nthe  public  business.”    Id.    Only  officials  exercising  judicial  or  quasi-\njudicial  functions,  such  as  executive  action  “analogous  to  those  of  a \nprosecutor” exercising prosecutorial discretion, “should be able to claim \nabsolute immunity.”  See id. at 515; see also Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 \nU.S. 800, 807 (1982) (absolute immunity is limited to judicial and quasi-\njudicial functions). \n50 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 51 of 101    Pg ID 5589\nNothing about the governmental defendants’ alleged actions in this \ncase indicate they were performing judicial or quasi-judicial functions.  \nDefendants highlight the federal SDWA, which grants wide latitude to \nthe states as the primary enforcement means of the statute.  (See, e.g., \nDkt. 102 at 32-33.)  The actions that the state actors are alleged to have \ntaken are the very essence of “executive officials exercising discretion,” \nfor which they are entitled only to qualified immunity.  See Butz, 438 U.S. \nat 507.  The motions to dismiss based on absolute immunity are denied. \nv.  Whether the Court of Appeals has exclusive \njurisdiction over this case \nDefendants  City  of  Flint,  Earley,  Ambrose,  Croft,  and  Glasgow \nargue  that  this  case  is  effectively  an  appeal  of  the  Emergency \nAdministrative  Order  that  the  EPA  issued  on  January  21,  2016, \npursuant to its emergency powers under the SDWA, and such order is a \nfinal order that can only be appealed to the Court of Appeals under the \nAct.  (See Dkts. 52 at 20-21.)  According to these defendants, plaintiffs’ \nrelief  requires  finding  numerous  facts  that  might  conflict  with  the \nAdministrative Order, and thus amounts to an appeal of it.  (Id. at 20-\n21.)  Plaintiffs respond that this Court should reject the argument as the \n51 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 52 of 101    Pg ID 5590\ncourt did in Concerned Pastors for Social Action v. Khouri.  (See, e.g., Dkt. \n122 at 25-26.) \nIn that case, defendants similarly argued that the plaintiffs’ claims \nwere “an implicit request for judicial review of the [January 21] EPA \norder.”  Concerned Pastors for Soc. Action v. Khouri, 194 F. Supp. 3d 589, \n596 (E.D. Mich. 2016).  The court rejected the argument because the relief \nplaintiffs sought, although parallel to “the EPA’s directives to the Flint \nand Michigan respondents,” and which might “augment those orders,” \nwas “wholly collateral to the SDWA’s review provisions.”  Id. at 599. \nThe SDWA’s exclusive review provision is even less applicable to \nthis  case  than  Concerned  Pastors.    The  Concerned  Pastors  plaintiffs \nbrought their case directly under the SDWA, seeking relief using its \ncitizen suit provision, see id. at 596, whereas plaintiffs in this case do not \nbring any claim under the SDWA.   And like the plaintiffs there, the \nplaintiffs in our case are “not a party to the action between the EPA and \nthe City of Flint,” nor are they “identified as ‘Respondents’ in the EPA’s \nemergency order.”  Id. at 598.  They are “not seeking to enjoin the EPA \nOrder either explicitly or implicitly.”  Id.  Federal statutory provisions \nproviding for exclusive jurisdiction in the Courts of Appeals are meant to \n52 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 53 of 101    Pg ID 5591\n“bar litigants from ‘requesting the District Court to enjoin action that is \nthe outcome of the agency’s order.’”  Id. at 598-99 (quoting F.C.C. v. ITT \nWorld Commc’ns, Inc., 466 U.S. 463, 468 (1984)).  Because the relief \nplaintiffs seek would not do so, defendants’ motion to dismiss on this \nbasis is denied. \nb. Whether plaintiffs engage in improper group pleading \nunder Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \nSome defendants argue that plaintiffs engaged in improper group \npleading and thus failed to give defendants “fair notice of what the . . . \nclaim[s are] and the grounds upon which [they] rest.”  (See, e.g., Dkt. 52 \nat 25-26 (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007); \nsee Dkts. 102 at 29-31, 105 at 18.)  The complaint clearly describes the \nspecific  conduct  plaintiffs  allege  as  to  each  individual  defendant.  \nDefendants have more than fair notice of the claims against them, so the \nmotions to dismiss on this basis are denied. \nc. Federal claims \nAs set forth above, plaintiffs’ claims cannot proceed against the \nState of Michigan, MDEQ, MDHHS, or individual state officials in their \nofficial  capacities  because  they  have  immunity  under  the  Eleventh \nAmendment.  The remaining governmental defendants and individual \n53 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 54 of 101    Pg ID 5592\nstate officials in their individual capacities argue they are entitled to \nqualified  immunity  and  also  that  plaintiffs  fail  to  plead  any \nconstitutional  claim.    The  Court  undertakes  a  two-step  analysis  to \ndetermine whether a defendant is entitled to qualified immunity.  First, \n“viewing the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff[s], [the Court] \ndetermine[s]  whether  the  allegations  give  rise  to  a  constitutional \nviolation.”  See Shreve v. Franklin Cty., 743 F.3d 126, 134 (6th Cir. 2014).  \nSecond, the Court “assess[es] whether the right was clearly established \nat the time of the incident.”  See id.  The Court may undertake either step \nfirst, with certain limitations not applicable here, Camreta v. Greene, 563 \nU.S. 692, 694 (2011); Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 236 (2009), and \naddresses each federal claim in that order. \ni.  Count 1 \nIn Count 1, plaintiffs bring a § 1983 claim against defendants City \nof  Flint,  Croft,  Glasgow,  Snyder,  Earley,  Ambrose,  Shekter  Smith, \nWyant, Busch, Cook, Prysby, and Wurfel, alleging that these defendants \ndeprived plaintiffs of a property right to which they are entitled pursuant \n54 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 55 of 101    Pg ID 5593\nto  a  state-created  contract,  in  violation  of  substantive  due  process.5  \nAccording to plaintiffs, these defendants violated their property right to \nclean  water  “when,  ceasing  to  provide  [p]laintiffs  with  safe,  potable \nwater, they provided [p]laintiffs with poisonous, contaminated water.”  \n(Dkt. 1 at 64-65.)  Although this is a tremendously serious allegation, \nplaintiffs  fail  to  plead  the  existence  of  a  constitutionally  protected \nfundamental interest, and a substantive due process claim cannot be \nbased on a state-created contract right alone.  The motions to dismiss this \nclaim are granted. \n   “[A]n entitlement under state law to water and sewer service d[oes] \nnot constitute a protectable property interest for purposes of substantive \ndue process.”  Mansfield Apartment Owners Ass’n v. City of Mansfield, \n988 F.2d 1469, 1476 (6th Cir. 1993) (quoting Ransom v. Marrazzo, 848 \nF.2d 398 (3d Cir. 1988)); see Bowers v. City of Flint, 325 F.3d 758, 763 \n(6th Cir. 2003) (“[M]ost, if not all, state-created contract rights, while \nassuredly  protected  by  procedural  due  process,  are  not  protected  by \n                                      \n5 Plaintiffs also bring this claim against the State of Michigan, MDEQ, and the \nindividual state defendants in their official capacities.  As set forth above, plaintiffs’ \nclaims against these defendants are barred by Sovereign Immunity.  Hereinafter, \ndefendants entitled to Sovereign Immunity are excluded from any analysis of the \nmerits of a claim in which they are included by plaintiffs. \n55 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 56 of 101    Pg ID 5594\nsubstantive due process.”) (quotations omitted).  Rather, “[s]ubstantive \ndue process protects fundamental interests, not state-created contract \nrights.”  Thomson v. Scheid, 977 F.2d 1017, 1020 (6th Cir. 1992) (citing \nCharles v. Baesler, 910 F.2d 1349 (6th Cir.1990)). \n  Plaintiffs  fail  to  identify  any  authority  to  show  they  have  a \nconstitutionally protected fundamental interest in clean water.  And the \nSixth Circuit has explicitly said that they do not.  Because plaintiffs base \nthis substantive due process claim solely on an alleged property right to \nclean water created by a contract with the state, this claim is dismissed. \nii.  Count 2 \nIn Count 2, plaintiffs bring a § 1983 claim against defendants City \nof  Flint,  Croft,  Glasgow,  Snyder,  Earley,  Ambrose,  Shekter  Smith, \nWyant, Busch, Cook, Prysby, and Wurfel, alleging that these defendants \ndeprived plaintiffs of a property right to which they are entitled pursuant \nto  a  state-created  contract,  in  violation  of  procedural  due  process.  \nAccording to plaintiffs, defendants deprived them of their contractually \nbased property right to purchase and receive safe, potable drinking water \nwithout notice or a hearing.  (Dkt. 1 at 65-66.)  Defendants argue that \nplaintiffs fail to plead the existence of a state-created property interest \n56 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 57 of 101    Pg ID 5595\nor  that  the  procedural  protections  afforded  by  the  state  are \nconstitutionally infirm.  (See, e.g., Dkt. 52 at 29.)  Because plaintiffs fail \nto plead both, the motions to dismiss this claim are granted. \nTo  establish  a  procedural  due  process  violation  under  §  1983, \nplaintiffs  must  show:    (1)  that  they  had  a  protected  life,  liberty,  or \nproperty interest; (2) that they were deprived of that protected interest; \nand (3) that the state did not afford them adequate procedural rights \nbefore depriving them of their protected interest.  Wedgewood Ltd. P’ship \nI v. Twp. of Liberty, Ohio, 610 F.3d 340, 349 (6th Cir. 2010). \nAs  noted  above,  “state-created  contract  rights”  are  “assuredly \nprotected by procedural due process.”  Bowers, 325 F.3d at 763.  And other \ncourts  have  found  that  “continued  utility  service  is  a  property  right \nwithin the meaning of the due process clause” requiring pre-deprivation \nnotice and a hearing.  Bradford v. Edelstein, 467 F. Supp. 1361, 1369 \n(S.D. Tex. 1979); see, e.g., Keating v. Neb. Pub. Power Dist., 562 F.3d 923, \n925 (8th Cir. 2009) (reversing district court dismissal of § 1983 claim \nwhen  plaintiffs  alleged  that  “state  officials  deprived  them  of  their \nprocedural due process rights when those officials ordered them to cease \ndrawing water from the Niobrara Watershed without providing prior \n57 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 58 of 101    Pg ID 5596\nnotice or a hearing”); see generally Memphis Light, Gas & Water Div. v. \nCraft, 436 U.S. 1, 19 (1978) (“Ordinarily, due process of law requires an \nopportunity  for  ‘some  kind  of  hearing’  prior  to  the  deprivation  of  a \nsignificant property interest.”). \nBut  property  interests  “are  created  and  their  dimensions  are \ndefined by existing rules or understandings that stem from . . . state law.”  \nSee Bd. of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972).  So, “property \ninterests  are  created  by  state  law”;  “whether  a  substantive  interest \ncreated  by  the  state  rises  to  the  level  of  a  constitutionally  protected \nproperty interest is a question of federal constitutional law.”  Bowers, 325 \nF.3d at 765 (quotations omitted).  “[O]nly those interests to which one \nhas  a  legitimate  claim  of  entitlement,  including  but  not  limited  to \nstatutory entitlements, are protected by the due process clause.”  Id. \nPlaintiffs fail to plead that they have a contract with the state or \nCity of Flint under Michigan law, and thus fail to establish the first \nelement required to make out their procedural due process claim.  See \nWedgewood Ltd. P’ship I, 610 F.3d at 349.  Under Michigan law, “a \ncontract requires mutual assent.”  Kloian v. Domino’s Pizza, L.L.C., 273 \nMich.  App.  449,  453  (2006).    But  there  is  no  mutual  assent  when  a \n58 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 59 of 101    Pg ID 5597\n“transaction between the parties with respect to the ‘exchange’ of money \nfor services was wholly devoid of free and open bargaining, the hallmark \nof contractual relationships.”  Borg-Warner Acceptance Corp. v. Dep’t of \nState, 433 Mich. 16, 22 (1989).  Specifically, if defendant City of Flint is \n“not legally capable of declining to” provide water services or “otherwise \naltering the basic nature of its duty,” and plaintiffs cannot choose “not to \npay the required fee,” there is no mutual assent to form a contract.  See \nid.; see, e.g., Lufthansa Cargo A.G. v. Cty. of Wayne, 142 F. App’x 265, 266 \n(6th Cir. 2005) (defendant legally required to provide service, and charge \nof fee for service “does not create an implied contract under Michigan law \nabsent consideration in return”). \nPlaintiffs claim that they “entered into a contract for the purchase \nand sale of potable, safe drinking water” with the “City of Flint.”  (Dkt. 1 \nat 70.)  But the City of Flint, through its City Counsel (and possibly the \nemergency managers in this case), sets the rate for water, see Flint Code \nof Ord. § 46-52(b)(1), (c)(1), which residents must pay to receive water \nservice.  See Flint Code of Ord. §§ 46-50, 46-51.  And water service “may \nbe denied to any consumer who is in default to the Division of Water \nSupply,” a division of the Department of Public Works, which suggests \n59 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 60 of 101    Pg ID 5598\nthat such service may not be denied if a consumer is not in default.  Id. \nat  §§  46-16  (emphasis  added).    Although  Flint  Code  of  Ord.  §  46-16 \ndefines  plaintiffs  as  consumers,  water  as  a  commodity,  and  the \nrelationship  between  plaintiffs  and  Flint  as  “that  of  vendor  and \npurchaser,” there is no “mutuality” as required by Michigan contract law.  \nSee Borg-Warner Acceptance Corp., 433 Mich. at 22. \nAnd even if plaintiffs had adequately pleaded the existence of a \nstate-created  contract  right,  they  fail  to  plead  that  the  procedures \nafforded them by the state are constitutionally inadequate.  To overcome \ndefendants’ motions to dismiss, plaintiffs must plead with particularity \nthat the process afforded them under state law was inadequate, including \npost-deprivation  damages  remedies  to  redress  the  alleged  breach  of \ncontract.  See Vicory v. Walton, 721 F.2d 1062, 1063 (6th Cir. 1983) (“[I]n \nsection 1983 damage suits for deprivation of property without procedural \ndue process the plaintiff has the burden of pleading and proving the \ninadequacy  of  state  processes,  including  state  damage  remedies  to \nredress the claimed wrong.”).  Plaintiffs do not sufficiently plead that \nstate procedures were inadequate, so their procedural due process claim \nis dismissed.  \n60 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 61 of 101    Pg ID 5599\niii.  Count 3 \nIn Count 3, plaintiffs bring a § 1983 state-created danger claim, \nalleging that all defendants except Veolia and Lockwood violated their \nsubstantive due process rights.  According to plaintiffs, defendants each \nacted  to  expose  them  to  toxic,  lead-contaminated  water  by  making, \ncausing to be made, and causing or making representations that the \nwater was safe to drink, and these actions and omissions were objectively \nunreasonable in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them.  \n(Dkt. 1 at 66-68.) \nDefendants argue that plaintiffs fail to plead this claim because \nthey do not allege an act of violence inflicted by a third party or danger \nspecific to plaintiffs as opposed to the public at large.  (See, e.g., Dkt. 52 \nat 31.)  Plaintiffs respond that it “is illogical to claim that public officials \ncannot  be  held  liable  for  creating  a  danger  and  injuring  a  plaintiff, \nwhereas they may be held liable if they created or increased a risk of \nharm that was carried out by a private third party.”  (See Dkt. 122 at 37.)  \nBecause  plaintiffs  fail  to  plead  that  defendants  subjected  them  to  a \nspecial danger as distinguished from the public at large, the motions to \ndismiss this claim are granted. \n61 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 62 of 101    Pg ID 5600\nTo prevail on a state-created danger claim, plaintiffs must establish \nthree elements:  (1) an affirmative act on the part of the government that \ncreates or increases the risk to plaintiffs, (2) a special danger to plaintiffs \nas distinguished from the public at large, and (3) the requisite degree of \nstate culpability.  Stiles v. Grainger Cty., 819 F.3d 834, 854 (6th Cir. \n2016).  Even assuming plaintiffs can establish a state-created danger \nclaim for harm directly caused by state actors, as opposed to private \nthird-parties, plaintiffs fail to show that defendants in this case created \na special danger to plaintiffs as distinguished from the public at large. \nIn the Sixth Circuit, the second prong of a state-created danger \nclaim is satisfied when “the government could have specified whom it was \nputting at risk, nearly to the point of naming the possible victim or \nvictims.”  Jones v. Reynolds, 438 F.3d 685, 696 (6th Cir. 2006). But when \n“the  victim  was  not  identifiable  at  the  time  of  the  alleged  state \naction/inaction,” the Sixth Circuit holds “that a § 1983 suit may not be \nbrought under the ‘state created danger’ theory.”  Id. at 697. \nFor example, a plaintiff cannot satisfy this standard when “officers \nnever interacted with [decedent],” no “evidence ha[d] been put forward \nsuggesting  that  the  officers  had  any  reason  to  know  that  they  were \n62 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 63 of 101    Pg ID 5601\nputting [the plaintiff] at risk by their action/inaction,” and the crowd \nplaintiff  was  among  when  she  was  injured  “contained  at  least  150 \npeople.”  Id.; see also Schroder v. City of Fort Thomas, 412 F.3d 724, 729 \n(6th Cir. 2005) (failing to enforce or lower the speed limit on a residential \nstreet “did not create a ‘special danger’ to a discrete class of individuals \n(of which the [plaintiffs’] son was a member), as opposed to a general \ntraffic  risk  to  pedestrians  and  other  automobiles”);  Jones  v.  City  of \nCarlisle, 3 F.3d 945, 949-50 (6th Cir. 1993) (holding that an epileptic \ndriver was “no more a danger to [the plaintiff] than to any other citizen \non the City streets”); Janan v. Trammell, 785 F.2d 557, 560 (6th Cir. \n1986) (holding that the release of an inmate on parole, who eventually \nmurdered a citizen, did not violate the Due Process Clause because “there \nis [no] showing that the victim, as distinguished from the public at large, \nfaces a special danger”).  Plaintiffs fail to plead the second element of \ntheir state-created danger claim, so it is dismissed.6 \n                                      \n6 It seems there is little difference between the state-created danger standard of \nconstitutional  liability  and  the  shocks-the-conscience  standard  of  constitutional \nliability.  See, e.g., Henry v. City of Erie, 728 F.3d 275, 282 (3d Cir. 2013) (to establish \nclaim under state-created danger theory, plaintiff must show that “a state actor acted \nwith a degree of culpability that shocks the conscience,” among other elements similar \nto those in the Sixth Circuit); Jones v. Reynolds, 438 F.3d 685, 695 (6th Cir. 2006) \n(state-created danger case citing Cty. of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 849 \n(1998), which address shocks-the-conscience standard).  Here, plaintiffs could not \n63 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 64 of 101    Pg ID 5602\niv.  Count 4 \n  In Count 4, plaintiffs bring a § 1983 substantive due process claim, \nalleging  that  all  defendants  except  Veolia  and  Lockwood  unlawfully \nviolated their fundamental interest in bodily integrity.  Defendants argue \nthat only a forcible physical intrusion into a person’s body against the \nperson’s will without a compelling state interest will suffice, and also that \nplaintiffs  fail  to  plead  that  defendants  were  motivated  by  malice  or \n                                      \nidentify, and the Court could not independently find, any case law in the Sixth Circuit \nin  which  a  state-created  danger  claim  was  permitted  to  proceed  against  the \ngovernment for harm that was caused directly, as opposed to harm that was caused \nby a third party.  But see Jones, 438 F.3d at 695 (noting in dicta that “[h]ad the officers \norganized or participated in this race, the issue would cease to turn on whether they \nwere responsible for harm caused by a private actor and would turn instead on \nwhether they had caused the harm themselves”).  Given that the state-created danger \ntheory arises from the Supreme Court’s decision in DeShaney v. Winnebago County \nDepartment  of  Social  Services,  489  U.S.  189  (1989),  one  way  courts  of  appeals \ninterpret the doctrine is that liability attaches to the state only “when it fails to \nprotect [a plaintiff] from third-party harms that it helped create.”  See Barber v. \nOverton, 496 F.3d 449, 458 n.1 (6th Cir. 2007) (Cook, J., concurring) (quoting Butera \nv. District of Columbia, 235 F.3d 637, 651 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (“We join the other circuits \nin holding that, under the State endangerment concept, an individual can assert a \nsubstantive due process right to protection by the District of Columbia from third-\nparty violence when District of Columbia officials affirmatively act to increase or \ncreate the danger that ultimately results in the individual’s harm.”)).  Because \nplaintiffs otherwise fail to plead the elements of a state-created danger claim under \nthe Sixth Circuit’s formulation, the Court need not decide whether plaintiffs can \nmaintain a state-created danger action against government actors for harm they \ncaused directly; the Court merely highlights that state-created-danger claims likely \ncollapse into shocks-the-conscience claims, like that which plaintiffs pursue in Count \n4 of their complaint.  See Martinez v. Cui, 608 F.3d 54, 64 (1st Cir. 2010) (“Lewis \nclarified that the shocks-the-conscience test, first articulated in Rochin v. California \n[], governs all substantive due process claims based on executive, as opposed to \nlegislative, action.”) (emphasis in original). \n64 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 65 of 101    Pg ID 5603\nsadism.  (See, e.g., Dkt. 52 at 32-33; see Dkts. 69 at 30-33 and 39-41, 70 \nat 27-32 and 38-39, 96 at 32-35, 102 at 39-44 and 57-62, 103 at 33-36 and \n47-52,  105  at  15-16.)    Because  plaintiffs  sufficiently  plead  that  the \nconduct  of  many  of  the  individual  governmental  defendants  was  so \negregious  as  to  shock  the  conscience  and  violate  plaintiffs’  clearly \nestablished  fundamental  right  to  bodily  integrity,  the  claim  is  only \ndismissed as to defendants Snyder, Glasgow, and Cook. \n  “The  touchstone  of  due  process  is  protection  of  the  individual \nagainst arbitrary action of the government,” and the Supreme Court has \ndefined  such  a  violation  as  “executive  abuse  of  power  as  that  which \nshocks the conscience” in the “constitutional sense.”  Cty. of Sacramento \nv. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 845-46 (1998).  To plead this claim against each \nexecutive official in this case, “plaintiffs must show[] not only that the \nofficial’s actions shock the conscience, but also that the official violated a \nright otherwise protected by the substantive Due Process Clause.”  See \nMartinez v. Cui, 608 F.3d 54, 64 (1st Cir. 2010) (citing cases). \n  It  has  long  been  held  that  one’s  right  to  bodily  integrity  is  a \nfundamental interest under the Constitution.  Union Pac. Ry. Co. v. \nBotsford, 141 U.S. 250, 251 (1891) (“No right is held more sacred, or is \n65 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 66 of 101    Pg ID 5604\nmore  carefully  guarded  by  the  common  law,  than  the  right  of  every \nindividual to the possession and control of his own person, free from all \nrestraint or interference of others, unless by clear and unquestionable \nauthority of law.”); see Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 272 (1994) (“The \nprotections  of  substantive  due  process  have  for  the  most  part  been \naccorded to matters relating to marriage, family, procreation, and the \nright to bodily integrity.”).  As to the first prong of the qualified immunity \nanalysis, plaintiffs’ “allegations give rise to a constitutional violation.”  \nShreve, 743 F.3d at 134.  They have a fundamental interest in bodily \nintegrity under the Constitution, and, as set forth below, defendants \nviolated plaintiffs’ fundamental interest by taking conscience-shocking, \narbitrary  executive  action,  without  plaintiffs’  consent,  that  directly \ninterfered with their fundamental right to bodily integrity.  Lewis, 523 \nU.S. at 845-46; Cui, 608 F.3d at 64; see generally Siegert v. Gilley, 500 \nU.S. 226, 232 (1991) (“A necessary concomitant to the determination of \nwhether  the  constitutional  right  asserted  by  a  plaintiff  is  ‘clearly \nestablished’  at  the  time  the  defendant  acted  is  the  determination  of \nwhether the plaintiff has asserted a violation of a constitutional right at \nall.”).  As to the second prong of the qualified immunity analysis, a series \n66 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 67 of 101    Pg ID 5605\nof Supreme Court cases over the last seventy-five years makes clear that \ndefendants violated plaintiffs’ clearly established rights. \nThe Court may consider decisions by the United States Supreme \nCourt, the Sixth Circuit, and district courts within the Sixth Circuit to \ndetermine whether the law has been clearly established.  Higgason v. \nStephens, 288 F.3d 868, 876 (6th Cir. 2002).  Decisions from other circuits \nmay be considered “if they ‘point unmistakably to the unconstitutionality \nof  the  conduct  complained  of  and  [are]  so  clearly  foreshadowed  by \napplicable  direct  authority  as  to  leave  no  doubt  in  the  mind  of  a \nreasonable  officer  that  his  conduct,  if  challenged  on  constitutional \ngrounds, would be found wanting.’”  Barrett v.

Dep’t of Health, 497 U.S. 261, 278 \n(1990) (“[A] competent person has a constitutionally protected liberty \ninterest  in  refusing  unwanted  medical  treatment.”).    Whether  such \n67 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 68 of 101    Pg ID 5606\nintrusion is consensual has been a key consideration in determining the \nconstitutionality of such invasion of an individual’s person since at least \n1942, when the Supreme Court held that the forced sterilization of adults \nis unconstitutional.  Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535, 541 (1942); see \nalso Winston v. Lee, 470 U.S. 753, 766-67 (1985) (the potentially harmful, \nnonconsensual surgical intrusion into a suspect’s chest to recover a bullet \nwithout a compelling need is unconstitutional).   \n  That defendants here violated plaintiffs’ clearly established right to \nbe free from conscience-shocking, arbitrary executive action that invades \ntheir  bodily  integrity  without  their  consent  is  further  exemplified  by \ncourts of appeals’ decisions interpreting these Supreme Court cases.  See, \ne.g.,  Barrett  v.

Stovall, 188 F.3d 327, 332 n.3 (6th Cir. 1999) (“[I]t is well-settled \n71 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 72 of 101    Pg ID 5610\nwere exposing the residents of Flint, including plaintiffs, to dangerous \nlevels of lead.  Lead poisoning caused plaintiffs to suffer from severe \nmedical problems with their hair, skin, digestive system, and organs, as \nwell  as  brain  and  other  developmental  injuries  including  cognitive \ndeficits, among other issues.  (Dkt. 1 at 65.) \nAnd when the evidence confirmed that, in fact, the lead levels in the \nwater and in residents’ blood were rising, these defendants worked to \ndiscredit  the  evidence  and  knowingly  and  proactively  made  false \nstatements to the public to persuade residents that the water was safe to \nconsume.    They  did  so,  even  though  their  own  testing  revealed  the \nopposite.  Many residents, plaintiffs included, continued to consume the \nwater in reliance on defendants’ false assurances. \nIt cannot be that such actions are not “so egregious, so outrageous, \nthat [they] may fairly be said to shock the contemporary conscience.”  See \nLewis, 523 U.S. at 847 n.8.  Nor can it be said that reasonable officials \nwould  not  have  had  fair  notice  that  such  actions  would  violate  the \nConstitution,  i.e.,  that  defendants  were  violating  plaintiffs’  clearly \n                                      \nthat ‘federal courts may take judicial notice of proceedings in other courts of record’ \n. . . .”) (quoting Granader v. Public Bank, 417 F.2d 75, 82-83 (6th Cir. 1969)). \n72 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 73 of 101    Pg ID 5611\nestablished  right  to  bodily  integrity  and  to  be  free  from  arbitrary, \nconscience shocking executive action.  As recently reiterated by the Sixth \nCircuit, immunity does not extend to “the plainly incompetent or those \nwho  knowingly  violate  the  law.”    Arrington-Bey  v.  City  of  Bedford \nHeights, No. 16-3317, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 3429, at *8 (6th Cir. Feb. \n24, 2017) (quoting White v. Pauly, __ U.S. __, 137 S. Ct. 548, 551 (2017)).  \nAnd particularly with respect to the individual governmental defendants \nwho are facing felony and misdemeanor criminal charges pursuant to the \nMichigan  Attorney  General’s  Flint  Water  Investigation,  qualified \nimmunity cannot and should not protect them from civil liability for the \nconstitutional violations that are pleaded against them.  Id.; see Barrett, \n798 F.2d at 575 (no qualified immunity for defendants who knowingly \nviolated state criminal law). \nAgain,  plaintiffs’  involuntariness  here  is  key.    See  Riggins  v. \nNevada,  504  U.S.  127,  137-38  (1992)  (forced  administration  of \nantipsychotic medication during trial violated Fourteenth Amendment); \nHarper, 494 U.S. at 229 (“The forcible injection of medication into a \nnonconsenting person’s body represents a substantial interference with \nthat person’s liberty.”); Cruzan, 497 U.S. at 278 (“[A] competent person \n73 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 74 of 101    Pg ID 5612\nhas a constitutionally protected liberty interest in refusing unwanted \nmedical  treatment.”);  Rochin  v.  California,  342  U.S.  165,  172  (1952) \n(“Illegally breaking into the privacy of the petitioner, the struggle to open \nhis mouth and remove what was there, the forcible extraction of his \nstomach’s contents . . . .  This is conduct that shocks the conscience.”).  \nPlaintiffs’ exposure to dangerous levels of lead was involuntary on two \nlevels. \nFirst,  it  was  involuntary  because  these  defendants  hid  from \nplaintiffs  that  Flint’s  water  contained  dangerous  levels  of  lead.  \nMisleading Flint’s residents as to the water’s safety—so that they would \ncontinue to drink the water and Flint could continue to draw water from \nthe Flint River—is no different than the “forced, involuntary invasions of \nbodily integrity that the Supreme Court has deemed unconstitutional.”  \nSee Heinrich ex rel. Heinrich v. Sweet, 62 F. Supp. 2d 282, 313-14 (D. \nMass. 1999) (utilizing false pretenses to engage patients in participating \nin  radiation  treatments  with  no  therapeutic  value  no  different  than \n“forced, involuntary invasions of bodily integrity that the Supreme Court \nhas  deemed  unconstitutional”).    Second,  it  was  involuntary  because \nunder state and municipal law, plaintiffs were not permitted to receive \n74 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 75 of 101    Pg ID 5613\nwater in any other way.  See Flint Code of Ord. §§ 46-25, 46-26, 46-50(b).  \nThe city defendants themselves make this argument.  (See Dkt. 52 at 37.)  \nEven had plaintiffs wanted to receive water from a different source, they \nwould not have been permitted to. \nDefendants claim they had a legitimate state interest in lowering \nthe cost of Flint’s water services.  Accepting that as true, any such cost-\ncutting measure cannot justify the harm that was knowingly inflicted on \nplaintiffs without their consent.  This is especially so given that Michigan \nlaw “forbids the price [of any water sold] to exceed[] ‘the actual cost of \nservice as determined under the utility basis of rate-making.’”  Davis v. \nCity of Detroit, 269 Mich. App. 376, 379 (2006) (quoting MICH. COMP. \nLAWS § 123.141). \nThe alleged actions of defendants City of Flint, Earley, Ambrose, \nWyant, Shekter Smith, Busch, Cook, Prysby, Wurfel, Wells, Lyon, Peeler, \nScott, and Croft are so egregious that “[e]ven absent the abundant case \nlaw that has developed on this point since the passage of the Bill of \nRights,  the  Court  would  not  hesitate  to  declare  that  a  reasonable \ngovernment  official  must  have  known  that  by  instigating  and \nparticipating in” the knowing provision of lead-laden water and then \n75 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 76 of 101    Pg ID 5614\nintentional and active concealment of this truth to the residents of Flint, \nwho were not legally permitted to obtain alternative water service, “he \nwould have been acting in violation of those rights.”  See In re Cincinnati \nRadiation Litig., 874 F. Supp. at 815.  For these reasons, the motions to \ndismiss are denied as to these defendants. \nPlaintiffs fail to plead with particularity that defendant Snyder was \ndirectly responsible for being involved in the decision making himself—\nrather,  according  to  plaintiffs,  he  should  be  responsible  because  he \nappointed the emergency managers who are also defendants in this case.  \nAnd  they  plead  that  defendant  Glasgow  argued  that  if  “water  is \ndistributed from this plant in the next couple of weeks, it w[ould] be \nagainst  [his]  direction,”  but  that  “management  above”  overrode  him.  \nFinally, plaintiffs plead that defendant Cook was involved in the decision \nto switch to Flint River water without proper study or corrosion control, \nbut fail to plead that he was involved in misleading the public after it \nbecame apparent that lead was rising to dangerous levels in the drinking \nwater.  Plaintiffs fail to allege that these three defendants violated clearly \nestablished law, so Count 4 must be dismissed as to them. \n76 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 77 of 101    Pg ID 5615\nd. State claims \nThe governmental defendants argue that they have state statutory \nimmunity for violations of state tort law and that plaintiffs otherwise fail \nto plead the state-law claims.  Defendants Veolia and Lockwood argue \nthat plaintiffs fail to plead their claims and that certain relief plaintiffs \nseek is unavailable in Michigan.  The arguments are addressed in that \norder. \ni.  Whether the governmental defendants have state \nstatutory immunity for violations of state tort law \nUnder MICH. COMP. LAWS § 691.1407, “a governmental agency is \nimmune from tort liability if the governmental agency is engaged in the \nexercise or discharge of a governmental function,” id. at § 691.1407(1), \nand “the elective or highest appointive executive official of all levels of \ngovernment are immune from tort liability for injuries to persons or \ndamages to property if he or she is acting within the scope of his or her \n. . . executive authority.”  Id. at § 691.1407(5). \nAs to lower level government employees, “each officer and employee \nof a governmental agency . . . is immune from tort liability for an injury \nto a person or damage to property caused by the officer[ or] employee . . . \nwhile in the course of employment or service . . . while acting on behalf of \n77 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 78 of 101    Pg ID 5616\na governmental agency if all of the following are met:  (a) [the officer or \nemployee] is acting or reasonably believes he or she is acting within the \nscope of his or her authority”; “(b) [t]he governmental agency is engaged \nin the exercise or discharge of a governmental function”; and (c) the \nofficer’s or employee’s  “conduct does not amount to gross negligence that \nis the proximate cause of the injury or damage.”  Id. at § 691.1407(2). \n  For such lower level employees, Michigan case law requires not only \nthat  the  employee  be  grossly  negligent,  but  also  that  the  employee’s \nactions were the proximate cause of the injury for a tort claim to proceed.  \nAn employee’s action is the proximate cause of the injury if it is “the one \nmost immediate, efficient, and direct cause, of the [plaintiffs]’ injuries.”  \nRobinson v. City of Detroit, 462 Mich. 439, 446 (2000).  “There cannot be \nother more direct causes of plaintiff’s injuries.”  White v. Roseville Pub. \nSchs., No. 307719, 2013 Mich. App. LEXIS 342, at *10 (Mich. Ct. App. \nFeb. 21, 2013).  If no reasonable juror could find that a lower level official \nwas “the one most immediate” cause of plaintiffs’ injuries, the claims as \nto those officials must be dismissed.  Robinson, 462 Mich. at 463. \n  The exception to the immunity statute is when plaintiffs seek “to \nrecover  for  bodily  injury  or  property  damage  arising  out  of  the \n78 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 79 of 101    Pg ID 5617\nperformance of a proprietary function.”  MICH. COMP. LAWS § 691.1413.  \nA proprietary function is “any activity which is conducted primarily for \nthe purpose of producing a pecuniary profit for the governmental agency, \nexcluding, however, any activity normally supported by taxes or fees.”  \nId. \nPlaintiffs argue that the governmental defendants are not entitled \nto  governmental  immunity  because  their  primary  purpose  in  selling \nwater to plaintiffs was to produce a pecuniary profit for the state and its \nagencies, and the municipalities’ and state’s sale of water is not normally \nsupported by taxes and fees.  (Dkt. 1 at 85.) \nMichigan  courts  have  held  that  the  “operation  of  the  water \ndepartment  is  not  a  proprietary  activity,”  i.e.,  is  not  excepted  from \ngovernmental  immunity,  in  part  because  Michigan  law  “requires  the \nprice of any water sold to be based on, and forbids the price to exceed, ‘the \nactual  cost  of  service  as  determined  under  the  utility  basis  of  rate-\nmaking.’”    Davis  v.  City  of  Detroit,  269  Mich.  App.  376,  379  (2006) \n(quoting MICH. COMP. LAWS § 123.141).  Thus, the proprietary function \nexception to state governmental immunity does not apply. \n79 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 80 of 101    Pg ID 5618\nAside  from  making  the  proprietary  function/non-governmental \nfunction  argument,  plaintiffs  seem  to  concede  that  the  emergency \nmanagers are the highest appointed executive officials of the city.  The \ntort claims against the emergency managers are thus dismissed.  So too \nfor defendant Croft, Flint’s Director of the Department of Public Works. \nSimilarly, the MDEQ employee defendants argue that defendant \nShekter Smith is entitled to absolute immunity as the highest appointed \nexecutive official of her agency—she is the Chief of the Office of Drinking \nWater  and  Municipal  Assistance  for  MDEQ.    MICH.  COMP.  LAWS \n§ 691.1407(5).  Defendant Wyant, as the former Director of MDEQ, also \nclaims absolute immunity from the tort claims (Dkt. 69 at 22), as does \ndefendant Wurfel, as the Director of Communications of MDEQ.  (Dkt. \n70 at 40.)  Plaintiffs do not argue that any of these defendants are not the \nhighest  appointed  or  elected  officials  of  their  levels  of  government.  \nRather, plaintiffs argue that none of the MDEQ employee defendants are \nabsolutely immune because they “knowingly l[ied] to EPA and the public \nas ‘performing oversight,’ and the lies alleged [] did not serve the ends of \nregulatory oversight”; because they used their office for an illegitimate \n80 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 81 of 101    Pg ID 5619\npurpose, according to plaintiffs, they are not entitled to immunity.  (Dkt. \n123 at 46-50.) \nBut whether something is considered a governmental function is \ndefined by the general activity performed, not the specific conduct of the \nindividual  employees.    Smith  v.  State,  428  Mich.  540,  608  (1987).  \nMichigan courts would find that these MDEQ employee defendants were \nperforming a governmental function, so they are entitled to immunity \nunder the state immunity statute.  The tort claims against defendants \nShekter Smith, Wyant, and Wurfel are thus dismissed. \nFinally, the State Defendants argue that defendants Snyder, Lyon, \nand Wells are entitled to absolute immunity under the state immunity \nstatute.  (See Dkt. 103 at 21.)  Because under Michigan law they are the \nhighest  “elective  or  highest  appointive  executive  official”  of  their \ndepartments  (see  Dkt.  144  (defendant  Wells  entitled  to  absolute \nimmunity)),  and  they  were  acting  in  the  scope  of  their  executive \nauthority, the tort claims against them are dismissed. \nAs to defendant Glasgow, a lower level employee, no reasonable \njury could find that he is the one defendant most directly responsible for \nplaintiffs’ harm.  Plaintiffs allege that defendant Glasgow stated “[i]f \n81 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 82 of 101    Pg ID 5620\nwater is distributed from this plant in the next couple of weeks, it w[ould] \nbe against [his] direction,” because he “need[ed] time to adequately train \nadditional staff and to update [MDEQ’s] monitoring plans before [he \nwould]  feel  [MDEQ  was]  ready.”    (Dkt.  1  at  22.)      They  allege  that \ndefendant Glasgow stated “management above” seemed “to have their \nown agenda.”  (Id.)  At the very least, the “management above” would be \nmore directly responsible for plaintiffs’ harms.  Thus, the tort claims are \nalso dismissed as to defendant Glasgow. \nAnd  defendants  Prysby  (an  engineer  at  MDEQ),  Cook  (a  water \ntreatment specialist at MDEQ), and Busch (the district supervisor for \nMDEQ), are lower level employees nonetheless entitled to immunity.  As \nwith  defendant  Glasgow,  even  if  plaintiffs  sufficiently  pleaded  that \ndefendants Prysby, Cook, and Busch were grossly negligent, reasonable \njurors could not find that any one of them was the proximate cause of \nplaintiffs’ injuries.  As alleged, defendants “Cook, Busch, and Prysby \nwere undeniably aware that no corrosion control was being used in Flint” \nby “no later than April 2015.”  (Dkt. 1 at 34.)  This was long after the \nwater allegedly began to harm plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs say it was “likely \nmuch earlier,” but this is insufficient to show that defendants Cook, \n82 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 83 of 101    Pg ID 5621\nBusch, and Prysby were the proximate cause of their injuries.  Thus, the \nstate tort claims against them are dismissed. \nFinally, even accepting as true that plaintiffs sufficiently allege \nNancy  Peeler,  a  lower  level  employee  at  MDHHS,  acted  with  gross \nnegligence, plaintiffs fail to show that she was the proximate cause of \ntheir injuries.  Taking plaintiffs’ allegations as true, defendant Peeler, at \nall relevant times an MDHHS employee in charge of its childhood lead \npoisoning prevention program, participated in, directed, and oversaw the \nDepartment’s efforts to hide information to save face, and to obstruct the \nefforts of outside researchers.  (Dkt. 1 at 12-13.)  And she tried to generate \nevidence that there was no lead contamination problem, even when her \nown Department had data that verified outside evidence to the contrary.  \n(Id.  at  13.)    Moreover,  when  MDHHS  epidemiologist  Cristin  Larder \nemailed defendant Peeler, among others, noting an increase in blood lead \nlevels  in  Flint  just  after  the  switch  and  concluding  that  the  issue \n“warrant[ed]  further  investigation,”  Peeler  attributed  it  to  seasonal \nvariation.  (Id. at 48.)  But given that lead levels were already rising in \nplaintiffs’ blood by the time Peeler is alleged to have acted, Michigan \ncourts would likely hold that a reasonable juror could not find that she \n83 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 84 of 101    Pg ID 5622\nwas the proximate cause of the harm.  Thus, the claims against her must \nbe dismissed.9 \nPlaintiffs  argue  that  dismissal  is  premature,  and  “it  should  be \nsufficient that [d]efendant’s alleged actions, taken as true . . . , could be \n‘the’ proximate cause of the Flint crisis.”  (Dkt. 121 at 30.)  But it is not \nenough to say any defendant’s actions were “among” those that caused \nplaintiffs’ harm.  (Id.)  Rather, the test is whether a jury could reasonably \nfind, if plaintiffs proved their allegations, that a defendant, individually, \nwas the most direct cause of the harm. \nAs  this  case  highlights,  the  more  governmental  actors  that  are \ninvolved in causing a massive tort in Michigan, the less likely it is that \nstate tort claims can proceed against the individual government actors, \ngiven the way the state immunity statute operates.  Because the harm \nthat befell plaintiffs was such a massive undertaking, and took so many \ngovernment actors to cause, the perverse result is that none can be held \nresponsible under state tort law, at least based on plaintiffs’ pleadings; it \nis nearly impossible to point to any one of the defendants as the most \n                                      \n9 Plaintiffs do not directly address defendant Scott, but they similarly fail to plead \nhow he—a data manager at MDHHS who attempted to refute outside evidence of \nrising lead levels—is the proximate cause of plaintiffs’ injuries.  The state tort claims \nas to defendant Scott are thus dismissed. \n84 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 85 of 101    Pg ID 5623\nproximate cause of plaintiffs’ injuries.  White, 2013 Mich. App. LEXIS \n342,  at  *10  (“There  cannot  be  other  more  direct  causes  of  plaintiff’s \ninjuries.”). \nIt is plaintiffs’ burden to plausibly plead who was most directly \nresponsible for the harm.  They fail to do so here, so all of the lower-level \ngovernmental employees are immune from plaintiffs’ state tort claims.  \nAccordingly,  plaintiffs’  Counts  7  (nuisance),  8  (trespass),  12  (gross \nnegligence),  13  (intentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress),  and  14 \n(negligent  infliction  of  emotional  distress)  are  dismissed  as  to  all \nremaining governmental defendants, based on state statutory immunity. \nii.  Breach of contract \nIn Count 5, plaintiffs allege that defendants City of Flint and State \nof Michigan breached the contract defendants had with plaintiffs for the \nsale and purchase of safe, potable water.  As set forth above, plaintiffs \nfail to sufficiently plead that they had such a contract under Michigan \nlaw.  See supra III.c.ii.  Plaintiffs claim for breach of contract is thus \ndismissed. \n85 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 86 of 101    Pg ID 5624\niii.  Breach of implied warranty \nIn Count 6, plaintiffs allege that defendants City of Flint and State \nof Michigan are liable for a breach of implied warranty.  According to \nplaintiffs,  these  defendants  directly  or  impliedly  promised  to  provide \nwater that was fit for human consumption and later admitted that the \nwater  supplied  was  contaminated  and  thus  not  fit  for  human \nconsumption, in breach of implied warranty.  (Dkt. 1 at 71-72.) \nDefendants  argue  that  the  implied  warranty  claim  must  fail, \nbecause implied warranty claims exist only under Michigan’s version of \nthe UCC and such a contract would be one for services, but the UCC only \napplies to contracts for goods.  Defendants also argue that even if the \nUCC did apply here, plaintiffs failed to comply with the UCC’s notice \nrequirements for bringing an implied warranty claim.  (Dkt. 52 at 39.)  \nPlaintiffs implicitly agree, arguing that the state’s UCC would never \n“apply to the supply of public drinking water to consumers.”   (Dkt. 122 \nat 45.)  And they fail to establish, and do not even argue, that implied \nwarranty claims exist outside the UCC.  (Id. at 44-46.) \n“Warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose \nare, by their nature, inapposite to a contract for services like that at issue \n86 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 87 of 101    Pg ID 5625\nhere.”  De Valerio v. Vic Tanny Int’l, 140 Mich. App. 176, 180 (1984).  \nPlaintiffs could not provide, in their briefs or at the hearing, and the \nCourt could not independently find, any Michigan case law in which \nimplied warranty claims were adjudicated as to contracts for services.  \nBecause breach of implied warranty claims exist only under the Michigan \nUCC, and the alleged contract here (which, as set forth above, does not \nactually exist) would be one for services and not goods for which the \nstate’s UCC is inapplicable, plaintiffs’ breach of implied warranty claim \nis dismissed. \niv.  Nuisance \nPlaintiffs allege that all defendants are liable for nuisance, because \nthey caused lead-contaminated water to be delivered to plaintiffs’ homes, \nwhich substantially and unreasonably interfered with their comfortable \nliving and ability to use and enjoy their homes.  (Dkt. 1 at 72-73.) \nAs noted above, all of the governmental defendants are entitled to \nimmunity from state tort liability.  That leaves the private defendants.  \nDefendants Veolia and Lockwood argue that the claim fails because they \ndid not control the nuisance.  (Dkts. 50 at 14-16, 59 at 19-22.) \n87 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 88 of 101    Pg ID 5626\nTo  plead  a  private  nuisance  claim  in  Michigan  (plaintiffs  only \nrespond to the motions to dismiss as to private nuisance, so we need not \naddress public nuisance claims), plaintiffs must show that defendants \ncommitted “a nontrespassory invasion of [their] interest in the private \nuse and enjoyment of land.”  Adkins v. Thomas Solvent Co., 440 Mich. \n293, 302 (1992).  Plaintiffs must show that defendants were “in control, \neither through ownership or otherwise,” which “must be something more \nthan merely issuing a permit or regulating activity on the property which \ngives rise to the nuisance.”  McSwain v. Redford Twp., 173 Mich. App. \n492, 498 (1988).  Put differently, Michigan courts do not impose liability \nwhen  a  “defendant  has  not  either  created  the  nuisance,  owned  or \ncontrolled  the  property  from  which  the  nuisance  arose,  or  employed \nanother to do work which he knows is likely to create a nuisance.”  Id. at \n499. \nPlaintiffs  argue  that  “control”  is  satisfied  because  defendants \nVeolia and Lockwood had the “power to prevent the injury.”  (Dkt. 117 at \n22.)  But the case cited by plaintiffs for this proposition—a defective \npremises case—holds that the “power to prevent the injury . . . rests \nprimarily upon him who has control and possession” of the premises.  \n88 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 89 of 101    Pg ID 5627\nSholberg v. Truman, 496 Mich. 1, 10-11 (2014).  Plaintiffs’ argument \nassumes the conclusion.  To plead their claim, plaintiffs are required to \nsufficiently allege that Veolia or Lockwood had sufficient control and \npossession  of  the  premises  to  establish  that  either  had  the  power  to \nprevent the injury. \nPlaintiffs plead that Lockwood, “an engineering firm, was hired to \nprepare Flint’s water treatment plant for the treatment of new water \nsources.”  According to plaintiffs, they were “responsible for providing \nengineering  services  to  make  Flint’s  inactive  water  treatment  plant \nsufficient  to  treat  water  from  each  of  its  new  sources.”    Plaintiffs \nelsewhere note that Lockwood was “the consultant.”  (Dkt. 1 at 21.) \nPlaintiffs plead that Veolia “was hired to conduct a review of the \nCity’s water quality, largely in response to citizen complaints.”  Veolia’s \n“task was to review Flint’s public water system, including treatment \nprocesses, maintenance procedures, and actions taken.”  According to \nplaintiffs,  “Veolia  had  an  opportunity  to  catch  what  [d]efendant \n[Lockwood]  had  missed  or  refused  to  warn  about.”    However,  Veolia \nconcluded that the water was “in compliance with . . . state and federal \nstandards and required testing.”  (Id. at 31.) \n89 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 90 of 101    Pg ID 5628\nBecause control under Michigan law “must be something more than \nmerely  issuing  a  permit  or  regulating  activity  on  the  property,”  see \nMcSwain, 173 Mich. App. at 498, defendants Veolia and Lockwood, in \ntheir  role  as  consultants  and  advisors,  cannot  be  held  liable  for  the \nalleged nuisance.  Their “control” is even less than that of a regulating or \npermit-granting authority.  Moreover, plaintiffs plead that defendant \nMDEQ was “Flint’s ‘primacy agency,’” and thus “responsible for ensuring \nthat Flint set water quality standards and properly treated its water” \n(Dkt.  1  at  25),  further  undercutting  their  argument  that  defendants \nVeolia  and  Lockwood  were  in  control  of  the  nuisance.    The  claim  is \ntherefore dismissed. \nv.  Trespass \nPlaintiffs allege that all defendants are liable for trespass, because \nthey  willfully  caused  contaminants  to  enter  plaintiffs’  property  and \nplaintiffs’  bodies.    (Dkt.  1  at  74.)    Again,  because  the  governmental \ndefendants are immune from state tort liability, this claim remains only \nas to defendants Veolia and Lockwood.  Defendants Veolia and Lockwood \nargue  that  the  claim  fails  because  they  did  not  intentionally  invade \nplaintiffs’ land with a tangible object.  (See Dkts. 50 at 16, 59 at 22.) \n90 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 91 of 101    Pg ID 5629\nIn  Michigan,  “claims  of  trespass  and  nuisance  are  difficult  to \ndistinguish  and  include  overlapping  concepts.”    Traver  Lakes  Cmty. \nMaint.  Ass’n  v.  Douglas  Co.,  224  Mich.  App.  335,  344  (1997).    But \nMichigan  courts  have  “recognized  a  desire  to  ‘preserve  the  separate \nidentities of trespass and nuisance,” Wiggins v. City of Burton, 291 Mich. \nApp.  532,  555  (2011),  and  thus  trespass  requires  “proof  of  an \nunauthorized direct or immediate intrusion of a physical, tangible object \nonto land over which the plaintiff has a right of exclusive possession.”  \nAdams v. Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Co., 237 Mich. App. 51, 67 (1999).  When \n“the possessor of land is menaced by noise, vibrations, or ambient dust, \nsmoke, soot, or fumes, the possessory interest implicated is that of use \nand enjoyment, not exclusion, and the vehicle through which a plaintiff \nnormally should seek a remedy is the doctrine of nuisance.”  Id. \nPut differently, although the intrusion of particulate matter may \ngive rise to a claim of nuisance, the “tangible object” requirement for \ntrespass is not met by such intrusion.  Id. at 69.  This is so because \nparticulate matter “simply become[s] a part of the ambient circumstances \nof th[e] space.”  Id.  Plaintiffs argue that they are permitted to plead in \nthe alternative, and defendants actions “either constitute[] a nuisance or \n91 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 92 of 101    Pg ID 5630\ntrespass.”  (Dkt. 117 at 23.)  But for different reasons, plaintiffs fail to \nplead either. \nEven if particulate matter were sufficient to satisfy the tangible \nobject requirement to plead a trespass in Michigan, plaintiffs fail to plead \nthat Veolia and Lockwood intended for the particulate matter to invade \nplaintiffs’ property.  “Trespass is an intentional tort, meaning it is based \non  an  intentional  act,”  specifically  requiring  “an  intentional  and \nunauthorized invasion.”   Swiderski v. Comcast Cablevision of Shelby, \nInc., No. 227194, 2002 Mich. App. LEXIS 806, at *8 (Mich. Ct. App. June \n4, 2002).  For these reasons, plaintiffs’ claim of trespass is dismissed. \nvi.  Unjust enrichment \nPlaintiffs allege that defendants City of Flint and State of Michigan \nreceived  the  benefits  of  funds  paid  by  plaintiffs  for  water,  that  they \nutilized these funds for the government, and that retaining the benefit of \nthese funds would be unjust.  (Dkt. 1 at 75.) \nDefendant City of Flint argues that an unjust enrichment claim is \na tort claim, and thus governmental immunity applies.  (Dkt. 52 at 46.)  \nDefendant  cites  one  case  in  which  the  Michigan  Court  of  Appeals \ncharacterizes tort claims to include “common law misappropriation and \n92 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 93 of 101    Pg ID 5631\nunjust enrichment.”  See Polytorx v. Univ. of Mich. Regents, Nos. 318151, \n320989, 2015 Mich. App. LEXIS 939, at *19 (Mich. Ct. App. May 7, 2015).  \nBut that case was about the statute of limitations.  Id. (holding that there \nis a three-year statute of limitations); see, e.g., Trudel v. City of Allen \nPark, Nos. 304507, 304567, 312351, 2013 Mich. App. LEXIS 1855, at *49 \n(Mich. Ct. App. Nov. 14, 2013) (citing MICH. COMP. LAWS § 600.5813). \nThe Michigan Supreme Court has held that “‘tort liability’ as used \nin [MICH. COMP. LAWS §] 691.1407(1) encompasses all legal responsibility \narising from noncontractual civil wrongs for which a remedy may be \nobtained  in  the  form  of  compensatory  damages.”    Mick  v.  Kent  Cty. \nSheriff’s Dep’t (In re Estate of Bradley), 494 Mich. 367, 397 (2013); see id. \nat 409 (McCormack, J., dissenting) (“[U]njust enrichment . . . . is based \non principles of equity; it sounds in neither contract nor tort, yet it shares \ncharacteristics of both.”).  And unjust enrichment claims are equitable \nclaims only available when there is no express contract.  But plaintiffs \ncould not identify, and this Court could not independently find, any case \nin which Michigan statutory immunity was extended to state actors for \nclaims of unjust enrichment. \n93 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 94 of 101    Pg ID 5632\nWhether the governmental defendants are entitled to immunity \nfrom unjust enrichment claims is a complicated and unsettled area of \nstate law.  Accordingly, the Court declines to exercise jurisdiction over \nthis claim.  28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(1) (“The district courts may decline to \nexercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim . . . [if] the claim raises a \nnovel  or  complex  issue  of  State  law.”);  see,  e.g.,  Arrington  v.  City  of \nRaleigh, 369 F. App’x 420, 423 (4th Cir. 2010) (district court abused \ndiscretion  by  retaining  jurisdiction  over  claim  involving  “state  law \nimmunity issues [that] are both novel and complex”). \nvii.  Negligence/professional negligence/gross \nnegligence against defendant Veolia \nPlaintiffs  allege  that  defendant  Veolia,  by  agreeing  to  work  for \ndefendant City of Flint on the switch from the Detroit River to the Flint \nRiver as its municipal water source, undertook a duty to plaintiffs and \ncarelessly and negligently caused plaintiffs’ harm.  (Dkt. 1 at 75-76.) \nDefendant  Veolia  argues  that  there  is  no  independent  cause  of \naction for gross negligence in Michigan, and ordinary negligence claims \ncannot  be  brought  against  Veolia  as  professionals,  thus  only  the \nprofessional negligence claim is proper.  (Dkt. 50 at 20.)  Veolia does not \n94 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 95 of 101    Pg ID 5633\nargue that the professional negligence claim should be dismissed as a \nmatter of law. \nDefendant  Veolia  is  correct  that  “gross  negligence  is  not  an \nindependent cause of action under Michigan law.”  Buckner v. Roy, No. \n15-cv-10441, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 108371, at *23 (E.D. Mich. Aug. 18, \n2015).  Plaintiffs do not adequately address Veolia’s argument that gross \nnegligence is used as a standard in certain types of claims rather than an \nindependent cause of action, instead stating in conclusory terms that \nthey have sufficiently alleged an action for gross negligence.  (See Dkt. \n117 at 19.) \nIn Michigan, gross negligence is used as a standard for a plaintiff’s \ntort claim to proceed against a defendant with whom the plaintiff has \nsigned a waiver of liability.  See Xu v. Gay, 257 Mich. App. 263, 269 (2003) \n(“A contractual waiver of liability also serves to insulate against ordinary \nnegligence, but not gross negligence.”).  The case plaintiffs cite to support \ntheir argument that gross negligence is an independent claim is merely \nan application of this principal.  See Sa v. Red Frog Events, LLC, 979 F. \nSupp. 2d 767, 778-79 (E.D. Mich. 2013) (waiver of liability did not apply \nbecause plaintiff adequately pleaded gross negligence).  Because gross \n95 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 96 of 101    Pg ID 5634\nnegligence is not an independent cause of action in Michigan, the claim \nis dismissed. \nAs to ordinary negligence, Veolia argues that because plaintiffs’ \nclaim  arises  from  actions  taken  in  “the  course  of  a  professional \nrelationship” and raises questions of its professional judgment “beyond \nthe realm of common knowledge and experience,” the claim is one of \nprofessional negligence.  (Dkt. 50 at 20-21 (citations omitted).)  According \nto Veolia, the ordinary negligence claim is precluded because Veolia is \nsued  as  a  water  treatment  professional.    (Id.  at  21.)    Veolia  quotes \nplaintiffs’  allegations,  which  identify  Veolia  as  a  “professional \nengineering  service[]”  that  was  required  to  “exercise  independent \njudgment . . . in according with sound professional practices.”  (Id. at 22.) \nPlaintiffs  respond  that  they  have  plausibly  alleged  that  Veolia \nviolated both standards of care—that of a reasonable person and that of \na reasonable professional—and thus both claims should remain.  (Dkt. \n117 at 20-21.) \nThe  cases  Veolia  cites  are  generally  medical  malpractice  cases, \nwhich are distinct from plaintiffs’ negligence claim here.  In Michigan, \nmalpractice actions do not include actions against engineers.  Nat’l Sand, \n96 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 97 of 101    Pg ID 5635\nInc. v. Nagel Constr., Inc., 182 Mich. App. 327, 340 (1990).  Rather, even \nassuming a “malpractice” action could be brought against an engineer, it \nwould  simply  mean  that  ordinary  “negligence  by  an  engineer  is \nmalpractice,”  not  “that  an  action  against  engineer  is  a  malpractice \naction.”  Id. at 339; see, e.g., Bacco Constr. Co. v. Am. Colloid Co., 148 \nMich. App. 397, 416 (1986) (sustaining ordinary negligence action against \nengineer for harm caused by miscalculations). \nThe professional negligence claim is dismissed.  Because Veolia \ndoes  not  argue  that  plaintiffs  otherwise  fail  to  sufficiently  plead  an \nordinary negligence claim, the claim survives. \nviii.  Negligence/professional negligence/gross \nnegligence against defendant Lockwood \nPlaintiffs make the same negligence/professional negligence/gross \nnegligence  claims  against  defendant  Lockwood  as  they  make  against \ndefendant Veolia, and defendant Lockwood makes similar arguments as \nthose made by defendant Veolia in its motion to dismiss.  (See Dkt. 59 at \n25-26.)  For the same reasons as those set forth above, the professional \nnegligence and gross negligence claims are dismissed but the ordinary \nnegligence claim survives. \n97 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 98 of 101    Pg ID 5636\nix.  Punitive damages/joint and several liability \nDefendants Veolia and Lockwood argue that punitive damages are \nnot recoverable in Michigan unless authorized by statute, which is not \nthe case here, and thus plaintiffs’ request for such damages must be \nbarred.  (Dkts. 50 at 20, 59 at 26.)  Plaintiffs respond indirectly, arguing \nthat exemplary damages are permitted.  (Dkts. 50 at 24-25, 59 at 20-21.) \nPunitive damages “are generally not recoverable in Michigan” with \nthe exception of when “they are expressly authorized by statute.”  Casey \nv. Auto Owners Ins. Co., 273 Mich. App. 388, 400 (2006).  And when a \nplaintiff does not identify “any statute that would grant them punitive \ndamages,” dismissal of a request for punitive damages is proper.  Id.  \nPlaintiffs do not do so here, so their request for punitive damages is \ndismissed. \nPlaintiffs are correct, though, as to exemplary damages; “exemplary \ndamages  are  distinct  from  punitive  damages  and  are  designed  to \ncompensate plaintiffs for humiliation, outrage, and indignity resulting \nfrom a defendant’s wilful, wanton, or malicious conduct.”  Fellows v. \nSuperior Prods. Co., 201 Mich. App. 155, 158 (1993) (quotations omitted).  \nRather than punishment for bad acts, for which punitive damages are \n98 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 99 of 101    Pg ID 5637\nawarded, exemplary damages are intended to compensate for emotional \nharms  that  are  not  adequately  compensated  by  pecuniary  or \ncompensatory damages.  Id.  Although the punitive damages request \nshould be dismissed, plaintiffs may be entitled to exemplary damages.  \nTheir request for exemplary damages may proceed. \nDefendant Veolia also argues that plaintiffs cannot recover joint-\nand-several liability in Michigan.  (Dkt. 50 at 27.)  Michigan has replaced \njoint-and-several  liability  with  fair-share  liability.    See  Smiley  v. \nCorrigan, 248 Mich. App. 51, 55 (2001).  Plaintiffs concede the point.  \n(Dkt.  117  at  12.)    Thus,  any  claim  for  joint-and-several  liability  is \ndismissed. \nIV.  Conclusion \nFor the reasons set forth above, the motions to dismiss (Dkts. 50, \n52, 59, 69, 70, 96, 102, 103, 105) are each GRANTED IN PART and \nDENIED IN PART. \nPlaintiffs’  Counts  1  (substantive  due  process  property  claim),  2 \n(procedural due process property claim), 3 (substantive due process state-\ncreated danger claim), 5 (breach of contract claim), 6 (breach of implied \nwarranty  claim),  7  (nuisance  claim),  8  (trespass  claim),  12  (gross \n99 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 100 of 101    Pg ID 5638\nnegligence claim), 13 (IIED claim), and 14 (NIED claim) are DISMISSED \nWITH PREJUDICE. \nPlaintiffs’ Count 4 (substantive due process bodily integrity claim) \nis  DISMISSED  WITH  PREJUDICE  as  to  defendants  Shekter  Smith, \nBusch, Prysby, Wurfel, Wells, Lyon, and Peeler in their official capacities.  \nCount 4 is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE as to defendants State of \nMichigan, MDHHS, MDEQ, Snyder, Cook, and Glasgow in its entirety.   \nThe Court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Count \n9  (unjust  enrichment  claim),  so  it  is  DISMISSED  WITHOUT \nPREJUDICE. \nPlaintiffs’  Counts  10  and  11  (professional  negligence  and  gross \nnegligence claims) are DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. \nPlaintiffs’  Count  15  (proprietary  function  claim)  is  not  an \nindependent cause of action, and so is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. \nAccordingly,  plaintiffs’  Count  4  (substantive  due  process  bodily \nintegrity claim) may proceed against defendants City of Flint, Earley, \nAmbrose,  Wyant,  and  Croft,  and  defendants  Shekter  Smith,  Busch, \nPrysby, Wurfel, Wells, Lyon, and Peeler in their individual capacities.  \n100 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 151   Filed 06/05/17   Pg 101 of 101    Pg ID 5639\nPlaintiffs’ Counts 10 and 11 (ordinary negligence claims) may proceed \nagainst defendants Veolia and Lockwood, respectively. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nDated: June 5, 2017    s/Judith E.

(Dkt. 151.)  In relevant part, the Court held that under Michigan \nlaw the professional negligence claims against the private engineering \nfirms—Veolia  North  America,  LLC  and  Lockwood,  Andrews  & \nNewnam, Inc.—had to be dismissed and only the ordinary negligence \nclaims  could  proceed.    (Id.  at  94-97.)    The  Court  also  held  that  the \nsubstantive  due  process  bodily  integrity  claim  was  properly  pleaded \nagainst defendant Daniel Wyant and that he is not entitled to qualified \nimmunity.  (Id. at 64-76.)  Defendants Veolia, Lockwood, and Wyant \nfiled  timely  motions  for  reconsideration  of  these  particular  holdings, \nand the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is holding the pending \ninterlocutory appeal of the qualified immunity rulings in abeyance until \nthis  Court  resolves  the  motions.    For  the  reasons  set  forth  below, \ndefendant Veolia’s and defendant Lockwood’s motions (Dkts. 155, 160) \nare granted, and defendant Wyant’s motion (Dkt. 159) is denied. \nTo prevail on a motion for reconsideration under Local Rule 7.1, a \nmovant  must  “not  only  demonstrate  a  palpable  defect  by  which  the \ncourt  and  the  parties  and  other  persons  entitled  to  be  heard  on  the \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   ECF No. 191   filed 07/14/17    PageID.6473    Page 3 of 10\nmotion have been misled but also show that correcting the defect will \nresult in a different disposition of the case.”  E.D. Mich. LR 7.1(h)(3).  “A \npalpable  defect  is  a  defect  that  is  obvious,  clear,  unmistakable, \nmanifest[,] or plain.”  Witzke v. Hiller, 972 F. Supp. 426, 427 (E.D. Mich. \n1997).  The “palpable defect” standard is consistent with the standard \nfor  amending  or  altering  a  judgment  under  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  59(e).  \nHenderson v. Walled Lake Consol. Schs., 469 F.3d 479, 496 (6th Cir. \n2006). \nMotions for reconsideration should not be granted if they “merely \npresent the same issues ruled upon by the court, either expressly or by \nreasonable implication.”  E.D. Mich. LR 7.1(h)(3).  And “parties cannot \nuse  a  motion  for  reconsideration  to  raise  new  legal  arguments  that \ncould have been raised before a judgment was issued.”  Roger Miller \nMusic,  Inc.  v.  Sony/ATV  Publ’g,  477  F.3d  383,  395  (6th  Cir.  2007).  \nNotably,  district  courts  are  increasingly  scrutinizing  improper  use  of \nmotions to reconsider.  See, e.g., Andersons, Inc. v. Consol, Inc., 208 F. \nSupp. 2d 847, 850 (N.D. Ohio 2002) (“Like the court in Nationwide, I \nhave  ‘noticed  a  recent  marked  increase  in  the  filings  of  motions  to \nreconsider.’  Also like that court, I hope that ‘publication of this Opinion \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   ECF No. 191   filed 07/14/17    PageID.6474    Page 4 of 10\nand Order will advise the bar that the undersigned intends to begin \nissuing show cause orders as to why sanctions should not be imposed for \nimproper filings of motions to reconsider.’”) (quoting Nationwide Mut. \nFire Ins. Co. v. Pham, 193 F.R.D. 493, 495 (S.D. Miss. 2000)). \nPlaintiffs originally brought ordinary negligence, gross negligence, \nand  professional  negligence  claims  against  defendants  Veolia  and \nLockwood.  The Court dismissed the gross negligence claim because it is \nnot  an  independent  cause  of  action  in  Michigan,  and  dismissed  the \nprofessional negligence claim, finding that claims against engineers are \ntreated as ordinary negligence claims in Michigan.  But as defendants \nVeolia and Lockwood correctly argue, the Court was incorrect. \nIn Michigan, to plead a negligence claim a plaintiff must allege:  \n“(1) the existence of a legal duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff, \n(2) a breach of such duty, (3) a proximate causal relationship between \nthe breach of such duty and an injury to the plaintiff, and (4) damages \nsuffered by the plaintiff.”  Schaendorf v. Consumers Energy Co., 275 \nMich.  App.  507,  512-13  (2007).    And  “[a]s  against  professional \nengineers,  a  ‘malpractice  claim  requires  proof  of  simple  negligence \nbased on a breach of a professional standard of care.’”  McM Marine v. \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   ECF No. 191   filed 07/14/17    PageID.6475    Page 5 of 10\nOttawa Cty. Rd. Comm’n, Nos. 286294, 290702, 2010 Mich. App. LEXIS \n614, at *21 (Apr. 13, 2010) (quoting Phillips v. Mazda Motor Mfg. (USA) \nCorp., 204 Mich. App. 401, 409 (1994)).  Plaintiffs will be required to \npresent expert testimony as to the professional standard of care that \ndefendants Veolia and Lockwood are alleged to have breached.  See City \nof Huntington Woods v. Orchard, No. 301987, 2012 Mich. App. LEXIS \n879, at *14-15 (May 10, 2012) (holding that defendant was entitled to \nJNOV  because  plaintiff  failed  to  present  expert  testimony  on  the \nprofessional standard of care). \nThe Court’s holding suffers from a palpable defect, i.e., a defect \nthat  was  plain,  and  “correcting  the  defect  will  result  in  a  different \ndisposition of the case.”  E.D. Mich. LR 7.1(h)(3);  see Witzke, 972 F. \nSupp.  at  427.    Accordingly,  defendant  Veolia’s  and  defendant \nLockwood’s  motions  (Dkts.  155,  160)  are  GRANTED.    Plaintiffs’ \nprofessional negligence claims against these defendants may proceed, \nbut the ordinary negligence claims are dismissed. \nAs noted above, defendant Wyant challenges the Court’s holding \nthat plaintiffs properly pleaded a substantive due process claim against \nhim and that he is not entitled to qualified immunity.  According to \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   ECF No. 191   filed 07/14/17    PageID.6476    Page 6 of 10\ndefendant Wyant, plaintiffs allege, at best, that he should be held liable \nbased on supervisor liability, which is not permitted in a § 1983 bodily \nintegrity  claim.    (Dkt.  159  at  10-11.)    He  also  notes  that  he  is  “not \namong those [d]efendants facing any criminal charges,” as are many of \nthose against whom the bodily integrity claim was properly pleaded.  \n(Id. at 9.) \nUnlike  defendants  Veolia  and  Lockwood,  defendant  Wyant \n“merely present[s] the same issues ruled upon by the court.”  E.D. Mich. \nLR  7.1(h)(3).    Defendant  Wyant  explicitly  made  this  very  same \nargument in his original motion to dismiss.  (See Dkt. 69 at 33-34.)  His \nmotion  should  be  denied  for  this  reason  alone.    See  E.D.  Mich.  LR \n7.1(h)(3) (motions should be denied if they “merely present the same \nissues ruled upon by the court”). \nBut even if that were not the case, the Court did not commit “a \ndefect  that  is  obvious,  clear,  unmistakable,  manifest[,]  or  plain.”  \nWitzke, 972 F. Supp. at 427.  The Court did not hold that the bodily \nintegrity claim should proceed against defendant Wyant on a theory of \nsupervisory liability.  Rather, the Court held that the bodily integrity \nclaim  should  proceed  against  defendant  Wyant  for  his  own  actions, \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   ECF No. 191   filed 07/14/17    PageID.6477    Page 7 of 10\ntaking plaintiffs’ allegations as true and in the light most favorable to \nthem, as this Court must. \nIn  their  complaint,  plaintiffs  allege  that  defendant  Wyant \n“participated  in,  directed,  and  oversaw  the  [Michigan  Department  of \nEnvironmental Quality]’s repeated violations of federal water quality \nlaws, the failure to properly study and treat Flint River water, and the \nMDEQ’s  program  of  systemic  denial,  lies,  and  attempts  to  discredit \nhonest  outsiders.”    (Dkt.  1  at  9.)    Specifically,  he  allegedly \n“disseminated false statements to the public that led to the continued \nconsumption of dangerous water despite knowing or having reason to \nknow that the water was dangerous.”  (Id. at 9-10.) \nDefendant Wyant was allegedly aware of a memorandum from the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency that “Flint has essentially not been \nusing any corrosion control treatment since April 30, 2014, and they \nhave  (lead  service  lines),”  but  untruthfully  wrote  to  various  state \nlegislators in response to their inquiries regarding the memorandum \nthat “[w]ith respect to the draft memo referenced in your letter, the \nMDEQ does not review or receive draft memos from the USEPA, nor \nwould we expect to while it is a draft.”  (Id. at 46.)  In his motion for \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   ECF No. 191   filed 07/14/17    PageID.6478    Page 8 of 10\nreconsideration,  defendant  Wyant  quotes  from  the  complaint  all  the \nallegations that claim he was aware of the rising blood lead levels in the \nwater  and  in  the  residents  of  Flint  when  he  made  the  untruthful \nstatements.    (Dkt.  159  at  8-9.)    Defendant  Wyant  admitted  that  the \nDepartment’s handling of the situation was botched from the beginning.  \n(Dkt. 1 at 58-61.)  And for his involvement, he resigned on December 30, \n2015.  (Id. at 61.) \nIn  holding  that  plaintiffs’  bodily  integrity  claim  may  proceed \nagainst certain defendants, including defendant Wyant, the Court held: \nPlaintiffs plead (with particularity as to which defendant did \nwhat)  that  these  defendants  were  the  decision  makers \nresponsible for knowingly causing plaintiffs to ingest water \ntainted  with  dangerous  levels  of  lead,  which  has  no \ntherapeutic benefits, and hiding the danger from them.  The \nemergency  managers  and  individual  state  employees \nswitched the source of Flint’s water from the Detroit River to \nthe Flint River, then knowingly took deliberate action that \nviolated federal and state, civil and possibly even criminal \nlaw, which caused the lead levels in Flint’s water to rise to \ndangerous  levels.    They  knew  that  their  actions  were \nexposing  the  residents  of  Flint,  including  plaintiffs,  to \ndangerous levels of lead.  Lead poisoning caused plaintiffs to \nsuffer from severe medical problems with their hair, skin, \ndigestive  system,  and  organs,  as  well  as  brain  and  other \ndevelopmental  injuries  including  cognitive  deficits,  among \nother issues. \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   ECF No. 191   filed 07/14/17    PageID.6479    Page 9 of 10\n \n(Dkt. 151 at 71-72 (footnote omitted).) \n  The  specific  allegations  that  plaintiffs  make  as  to  defendant \nWyant establish that the bodily integrity claim was properly pleaded \nagainst him, especially given his allegedly untruthful statements to the \nstate legislators.  The Court did not commit a plain error in finding so. \nAnd  in  any  case,  as  set  forth  above,  defendant  Wyant  already \nmade this exact argument, and the Court has already ruled on it.  He \nmay disagree with the ruling, but his recourse is to appeal the decision \nat the appropriate time.  A motion for reconsideration is not the proper \nplace  to  address  his  argument  again.    Accordingly,  this  motion  for \nreconsideration (Dkt. 159) is DENIED. \n  IT IS SO ORDERED. \nDated: July 14, 2017    s/Judith E. Levy                     \nAnn Arbor, Michigan        JUDITH E.

As a cost-saving measure until a new water \nauthority was to become operational, public officials switched the City of Flint municipal water \nsupply from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) to the Flint River to be \nprocessed by an outdated and previously mothballed water treatment plant.  With the approval of \nState of Michigan regulators and a professional engineering firm, on April 25, 2014, the City \nbegan dispensing drinking water to its customers without adding chemicals to counter the river \nwater’s known corrosivity.   \n\nCase 5:16-c  v -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 6 P9a5g4e  :   3Page 7 of 75(7 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 3 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nThe  harmful  effects  were  as  swift  as  they  were  severe.    Within  days,  residents \ncomplained of foul smelling and tasting water.  Within weeks, some residents’ hair began to fall \nout and their skin developed rashes.  And within a year, there were positive tests for E. coli, a \nspike in deaths from Legionnaires’ disease, and reports of dangerously high blood-lead levels in \nFlint children.  All of this resulted because the river water was 19 times more corrosive than the \nwater  pumped  from  Lake  Huron  by  the  DWSD,  and  because,  without  corrosion-control \ntreatment, lead leached out of the lead-based service lines at alarming rates and found its way to \nthe homes of Flint’s residents.  The crisis was predictable, and preventable.  See generally Mason \nv. Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, P.C., 842 F.3d 383, 387 (6th Cir. 2016).   \nI. \nPlaintiffs  Shari  Guertin,  her  minor  child  E.B.,  and  Diogenes  Muse-Cleveland  claim \npersonal  injuries  and  damages  from  drinking  and  bathing  in  the  lead-contaminated  water.  \nPlaintiffs’  complaint  asserted  various  claims  against  numerous  state,  city,  and  private-actor \ndefendants.  In response to motions to dismiss, the district court granted in part and denied in \npart the motions.  In its written order, the court dismissed many of the original claims and \noriginal defendants.  Plaintiffs have not filed a cross appeal.  The defendants who were not \ndismissed now appeal and are collectively referred to as “defendants” throughout this opinion.  \nThe plaintiffs’ sole remaining claim is that defendants violated their right to bodily integrity as \nguaranteed by the Substantive Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  They bring \nthis claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, under which “an individual may bring a private cause of \naction against anyone who, under color of state law, deprives a person of rights, privileges, or \nimmunities secured by the Constitution or conferred by federal statute.”  Wurzelbacher v. Jones-\nKelley, 675 F.3d 580, 583 (6th Cir. 2012).   \nII. \n  On this appeal, we decide two substantial issues of public importance.  First, viewing \neach defendant individually, did the district court err in denying defendants’ motions to dismiss \nbased  upon  qualified  immunity?    Specifically,  did  plaintiffs  plead  a  plausible  Fourteenth \nAmendment Due Process violation of their right to bodily integrity and was such a constitutional \n\nCase 5:16-c  v -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 6 P9a5g5e  :   4Page 8 of 75(8 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 4 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nright clearly established when the defendants acted?  We join the United States District Court for \nthe Eastern District of Michigan, In re Flint Water Cases, 329 F. Supp. 3d 369 (E.D. Mich. \n2018), vacated on other grounds (Nov. 9, 2018), and Guertin v. Michigan, 2017 WL 2418007 \n(E.D. Mich. June 4, 2017), the Michigan Court of Appeals, Mays v. Snyder, 916 N.W.2d 227 \n(Mich. Ct. App. 2018), and the Michigan Court of Claims, Mays v. Snyder, No. 16-000017-MM \n(Mich. Ct. Cl. Oct. 26, 2016),1 in holding that plaintiffs have pled a plausible Due Process \nviolation of bodily integrity regarding some of the defendants.  For the reasons that follow, we \naffirm the district court’s order denying the motions to dismiss based upon qualified immunity \nregarding defendants Howard Croft, Darnell Earley, Gerald Ambrose, Liane Shekter-Smith,2 \nStephen Busch, Michael Prysby, and Bradley Wurfel.  However, we reverse the denial of the \nmotions to dismiss regarding defendants Daniel Wyant, Nick Lyon, Eden Wells, Nancy Peeler, \nand Robert Scott because plaintiffs’ complaint alleges mere negligence, and not a constitutional \nviolation against them.   \n  The  second  issue  is  whether  the  City  of  Flint  is  entitled  to  Eleventh  Amendment \nimmunity from plaintiffs’ suit because the takeover by the State of Michigan of the City of Flint \npursuant to Michigan’s “Emergency Manager” law transformed the City into an arm of the state.  \nIt is not, and we therefore affirm the district court’s same holding.   \nIII. \n  We possess jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 and the “collateral-order doctrine,” as \ndefendants are appealing the denial of qualified and Eleventh Amendment immunity.  Kaminski \nv. Coulter, 865 F.3d 339, 344 (6th Cir. 2017).  The district court granted in part and denied in \npart defendants’ motions to dismiss plaintiffs’ complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(6).  Given this procedural posture, we construe the complaint in the light most favorable to \nplaintiffs, accept all well-pleaded factual allegations as true, and draw all reasonable inferences \nin plaintiffs’ favor.  Crosby v. Univ. of Ky., 863 F.3d 545, 551–52 (6th Cir. 2017).  But if we are \n                                                 \n1The Michigan Court of Appeals and Michigan Court of Claims construed the Due Process Clause of the \nMichigan Constitution and, following Michigan precedent, deemed it coextensive with its federal counterpart.  See, \ne.g., Mays, 916 N.W.2d at 261.   \n2We have changed the docket to correct plaintiffs’ misspelling of Shekter-Smith’s name. \n\nCase 5:16-c  v -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 6 P9a5g6e  :   5Page 9 of 75(9 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 5 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nto  affirm,  the  factual  allegations  in  plaintiffs’  complaint  must  plausibly  allege  a  legally \nrecognized constitutional claim.  See generally Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 556–58 \n(2007).   \nIV. \nQualified immunity shields public officials “from undue interference with their duties \nand from potentially disabling threats of liability.”  Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 806 \n(1982).  It is not a “mere defense to liability”; the doctrine provides “immunity from suit.”  \nMitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526 (1985).  This immunity “gives government officials \nbreathing  room  to  make  reasonable  but  mistaken  judgments  about  open  legal  questions,” \n“protect[ing] all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.”  Ashcroft \nv. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. 731, 743 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted).  A plaintiff bears the \nburden of showing that a defendant is not entitled to qualified immunity.  Bletz v. Gribble, \n641 F.3d 743, 750 (6th Cir. 2011).  To do so, a plaintiff must show “(1) that the official violated \na statutory or constitutional right, and (2) that the right was clearly established at the time of the \nchallenged conduct.”  al-Kidd, 563 U.S. at 735 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The district \ncourt concluded plaintiffs met this standard, and we review that decision de novo.  Sutton v. \nMetro. Gov’t of Nashville & Davidson Cty., 700 F.3d 865, 871 (6th Cir. 2012).   \nThe assertion of qualified immunity at the motion-to-dismiss stage pulls a court in two, \ncompeting  directions.    On  the  one  hand,  the  Supreme  Court  has  repeatedly  “stressed  the \nimportance of resolving immunity questions at the earliest possible stage in litigation.”  Pearson \nv. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 232 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).  But on the other, \n“[w]hen qualified immunity is asserted at the pleading stage,” as defendants did here, “the \nprecise factual basis for the plaintiff’s claim or claims may be hard to identify.”  Id. at 238–39 \n(citation omitted).  We have thus cautioned that “it is generally inappropriate for a district court \nto  grant  a  12(b)(6)  motion  to  dismiss  on  the  basis  of  qualified  immunity.    Although  . . . \nentitlement to qualified immunity is a threshold question to be resolved at the earliest possible \npoint, that point is usually summary judgment and not dismissal under Rule 12.”  Wesley v. \nCampbell,  779  F.3d  421,  433–34  (6th  Cir.  2015)  (internal  citations,  quotation  marks,  and \n\nCase 5:16-cv  -  1  2C4a1s2e-J: E17L--1M6K9M8       E DCoFc uNmo.e 2n4t:0 6  4 f-i2le  d    0F1il/e0d4:/ 1091 / 0  4P/a2g0e1I9D  . 6  9P5a7g e  :  P6age 10 of (7150 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 6 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nbrackets omitted).  The reasoning for our general preference is straightforward:  “Absent any \nfactual development beyond the allegations in a complaint, a court cannot fairly tell whether a \ncase is ‘obvious’ or ‘squarely governed’ by precedent, which prevents us from determining \nwhether the facts of this case parallel a prior decision or not” for purposes of determining \nwhether a right is clearly established.  Evans-Marshall v. Bd. of Educ. of Tipp City Exempted \nVill. Sch. Dist., 428 F.3d 223, 235 (6th Cir. 2005) (Sutton, J., concurring) (brackets omitted).   \nV. \nThe Fourteenth Amendment provides that “[n]o State shall . . . deprive any person of life, \nliberty, or property, without due process of law.”  U.S. CONST. amend. XIV, § 1.  Flowing \ndirectly from the protections enshrined in the Magna Carta, see, e.g., Lewellen v. Metro. Gov’t of \nNashville  &  Davidson  Cty.,  34  F.3d  345,  348  (6th  Cir.  1994),  the  Due  Process  Clause \nsignificantly restricts government action—its core is “prevent[ing] government from abusing its \npower, or employing it as an instrument of oppression.”  Collins v. City of Harker Heights, \n503 U.S. 115, 126 (1992) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted); see also Cty. of \nSacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 845–46 (1998) (“The touchstone of due process is protection \nof the individual against  arbitrary  action of  government,  [including] the exercise of power \nwithout  any  reasonable  justification  in  the  service  of  a  legitimate  government  objective.”  \n(internal quotation marks omitted)).  Although the Clause provides no guarantee “of certain \nminimal levels of safety and security,” it expressly prohibits deprivations by “the State itself.”  \nDeShaney v. Winnebago Cty. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 195 (1989).  That is, “[i]ts \npurpose [is] to protect the people from the State, not to ensure that the State protect[] them from \neach other.”  Id. at 196.   \nThere are procedural and substantive due process components.  See Range v. Douglas, \n763 F.3d 573, 588 (6th Cir. 2014).  Only the latter component is at issue here.  Substantive due \nprocess “bar[s] certain government actions regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to \nimplement them.”  Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327, 331 (1986).  It “specifically protects those \nfundamental rights and liberties which are, objectively, deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and \ntradition, and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, such that neither liberty nor justice would \n\nCase 5:16-cv  -  1  2C4a1s2e-J: E17L--1M6K9M8       E DCoFc uNmo.e 2n4t:0 6  4 f-i2le  d    0F1il/e0d4:/ 1091 / 0  4P/a2g0e1I9D  . 6  9P5a8g e  :  P7age 11 of (7151 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 7 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nexist if they were sacrificed.”  Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 720–21 (1997) (internal \nquotation marks and citations omitted).  The liberty interests secured by the Due Process Clause \n“include[] the right ‘generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized at common law as \nessential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.’”  Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, \n673  (1977)  (quoting  Meyer  v.  Nebraska,  262  U.S.  390,  399  (1923)).    These  common-law \nprivileges,  the  Supreme  Court  has  held,  specifically  embrace  the  right  to  bodily  integrity, \nGlucksberg, 521 U.S. at 720, and the right not to be subjected to arbitrary and capricious \ngovernment action that “shocks the conscience and violates the decencies of civilized conduct.”  \nLewis, 523 U.S. at 846–47 (internal quotation marks omitted).   \nThe Supreme Court “has always been reluctant to expand the concept of substantive due \nprocess because guideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this uncharted area are scarce and \nopen-ended.”  Collins, 503 U.S. at 125.  Substantive Due Process is not “a rigid conception, nor \ndoes it offer recourse for every wrongful action taken by the government.”  EJS Props., LLC v. \nCity of Toledo, 698 F.3d 845, 862 (6th Cir. 2012).  As such, it “does not purport to supplant \ntraditional tort law in laying down rules of conduct to regulate liability for injuries that attend \nliving together in society.”  Daniels, 474 U.S. at 332.  That means a “‘careful description’ of the \nasserted fundamental liberty interest” is essential, Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 721 (citation omitted), \notherwise the Clause would turn into “a font of tort law to be superimposed upon whatever \nsystems may already be administered by the States.”  Daniels, 474 U.S. at 332 (citation omitted).  \nAccordingly,  we  “focus  on  the  allegations  in  the  complaint  to  determine  how  [plaintiffs] \ndescribe[] the constitutional right at stake and what the [defendants] allegedly did to deprive \n[them] of that right.”  Collins, 503 U.S. at 125.   \nA. \nPlaintiffs’ complaint deals with the scope of the right to bodily integrity, an indispensable \nright recognized at common law as the “right to be free from . . . unjustified intrusions on \npersonal  security”  and  “encompass[ing]  freedom  from  bodily  restraint  and  punishment.”  \nIngraham, 430 U.S. at 673–74; see also Davis v. Hubbard, 506 F. Supp. 915, 930 (N.D. Ohio \n\nCase 5:16-cv  -  1  2C4a1s2e-J: E17L--1M6K9M8       E DCoFc uNmo.e 2n4t:0 6  4 f-i2le  d    0F1il/e0d4:/ 1091 / 0  4P/a2g0e1I9D  . 6  9P5a9g e  :  P8age 12 of (7152 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 8 \n/1752 /1769 \n \n1980) (“In the history of the common law, there is perhaps no right which is older than a \nperson’s right to be free from unwarranted personal contact.”  (collecting authorities)).   \nThis common law right is first among equals.  As the Supreme Court has said:  “No right \nis held more sacred, or is more carefully guarded by the common law, than the right of every \nindividual to the possession and control of his own person, free from all restraint or interference \nof others, unless by clear and unquestionable authority of law.”  Union Pac. Ry. Co. v. Botsford, \n141 U.S. 250, 251 (1891); cf. Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, 772 (1966) (“The integrity \nof an individual’s person is a cherished value of our society.”).  Absent lawful authority, invasion \nof one’s body “is an indignity, an assault, and a trespass” prohibited at common law.  Union Pac. \nRy., 384 U.S. at 252.  On this basis, we have concluded “[t]he right to personal security and to \nbodily integrity bears an impressive constitutional pedigree.”  Doe v. Claiborne Cty., 103 F.3d \n495, 506 (6th Cir. 1996).   \n“[T]his right is fundamental where ‘the magnitude of the liberty deprivation that the \nabuse inflicts upon the victim strips the very essence of personhood.’”  Kallstrom v. City of \nColumbus, 136 F.3d 1055, 1063 (6th Cir. 1998) (quoting Doe, 103 F.3d at 506–07) (brackets and \nellipsis  omitted).    “We  have  never  retreated  . . .  from  our  recognition  that  any  compelled \nintrusion into the human body implicates significant, constitutionally protected . . . interests.”  \nMissouri v. McNeely, 569 U.S. 141, 159 (2013) (emphasis added); see also Rochin v. California, \n342 U.S. 165, 172 (1952) (forcibly pumping a detainee’s stomach to obtain evidence was “too \nclose to the rack and the screw to permit of constitutional differentiation”).  And more broadly, it \nis beyond debate that an individual’s “interest in preserving her life is one of constitutional \ndimension.”  Nishiyama v. Dickson Cty., 814 F.2d 277, 280 (6th Cir. 1987) (en banc), abrogated \non other grounds as recognized in Jones v. Reynolds, 438 F.3d 685, 694–95 (6th Cir. 2006).   \nBodily integrity cases “usually arise in the context of government-imposed punishment or \nphysical restraint,” but that is far from a categorical rule.  Kallstrom, 136 F.3d at 1062 (collecting \ncases).  Instead, the central tenet of the Supreme Court’s vast bodily integrity jurisprudence is \nbalancing an individual’s common law right to informed consent with tenable state interests, \nregardless of the manner in which the government intrudes upon an individual’s body.  See, e.g., \n\nCase 5:16-cv  -  1  2C4a1s2e-J: E17L--1M6K9M8       E DCoFc uNmo.e 2n4t:0 6  4 f-i2le  d    0F1il/e0d4:/ 1091 / 0  4P/a2g0e1I9D  . 6  9P6a0g e  :  P9age 13 of (7153 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 9 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nCruzan v. Dir., Missouri Dep’t of Health, 497 U.S. 261, 269–70 (1990).  Thus, to show that the \ngovernment has violated one’s right to bodily integrity, a plaintiff need not “establish any \nconstitutional significance to the means by which the harm occurs[.]”  Boler v. Earley, 865 F.3d \n391, 408 n.4 (6th Cir. 2017).  That is because “individuals possess a constitutional right to be \nfree from forcible intrusions on their bodies against their will, absent a compelling state interest.”  \nPlanned Parenthood Sw. Ohio Region v. DeWine, 696 F.3d 490, 506 (6th Cir. 2012).   \nA few examples illustrate the breadth of this tenet.  Consider Washington v. Harper, \nwhich  addressed  the  State  of  Washington’s  involuntary  administration  of  antipsychotic \nmedication to an inmate without a judicial hearing.  494 U.S. 210, 213–17 (1990).  There, the \nSupreme Court had “no doubt” that the inmate “possess[ed] a significant liberty interest in \navoiding unwanted administration of antipsychotic drugs under the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth  Amendment.”    Id.  at  221–22.    This  “interest  in  avoiding  the  unwarranted \nadministration of antipsychotic drugs is not insubstantial.  The forcible injection of medication \ninto  a  nonconsenting  person’s  body  represents  a  substantial  interference  with  that  person’s \nliberty.”  Id. at 229 (citing Winston v. Lee, 470 U.S. 753 (1985), and Schmerber, 384 U.S. 757).  \nAnd this is especially so when the foreign substance “can have serious, even fatal, side effects” \ndespite some therapeutic benefits.  Id.  But the extent of this interference, reasoned the Court, is \ncircumscribed by the government’s interest (there, administering medication in the custodial \nsetting).  Id. at 222–27.  Examining those interests, the Court permitted the physical intrusion \nupon a showing of certain circumstances—danger to self or others, and in the inmate’s medical \ninterest.  Id. at 227; see also Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 135–38 (1992) (applying Harper \nto the forced administration of drugs in trial and pretrial settings and focusing upon the state’s \n“overriding  justification  and  a  determination  of  medical  appropriateness”  to  justify  the \nintrusion); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166, 177–86 (2003) (similar).   \nThe  Supreme  Court’s  seminal  “right  to  die”  case,  Cruzan  v.  Director,  Missouri \nDepartment of Health, provides further explication.  At issue in Cruzan was whether the parents \nof  an  individual  in  a  persistent  vegetative  state  could  insist  that  a  hospital  withdraw  life-\nsustaining care based on her right to bodily integrity.  497 U.S. at 265–69.  Writing for the Court, \nChief  Justice  Rehnquist  extensively  detailed  the  line  between  the  common  law,  informed \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 6 P9a6g1e  :   1P0age 14 of (7154 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v.

Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 (1905); Breithaupt v. Abram, 352 U.S. 432 \n(1957); Harper, 494 U.S. 210; Vitek v. Jones, 445 U.S. 480 (1980); and Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. \n584  (1979)).    And,  although  the  Court  assumed  as  much,  “the  logic  of  [these]  cases  . . . \nembrace[s] . . . a liberty interest” in “artificially delivered food and water essential to life.”  Id. at \n279.  As with Harper, the Court’s main inquiry was not whether the case dealt with the right to \nbodily  integrity,  but  rather  how  to  balance  this  right  with  a  competing  state  interest  (the \nprotection of life) in relation to the procedural protections provided (the state’s requirement that \nan  incompetent  person’s  wishes  to  withdraw  treatment  be  proven  by  clear  and  convincing \nevidence).  Id. at 280–87; cf. Winston, 470 U.S. at 759 (holding that a non-consensual “surgical \nintrusion  into  an  individual’s  body  for  evidence”  without  a  compelling  state  need  is \nunreasonable).   \nThis nonconsensual intrusion vis-à-vis government interest line of cases has played out \ntime and time again in the lower courts.  See, e.g., United States v. Brandon, 158 F.3d 947, 953 \n(6th Cir. 1998) (“[T]he issue of forced medication implicates . . . [the] liberty interest in being \nfree  from  bodily  intrusion.”).3    The  numerous  cases  involving  government  experiments  on \nunknowing  and  unwilling  patients  provide  a  strong  analogy  to  the  Flint  Water  Crisis.4  \nInvoluntarily  subjecting  nonconsenting  individuals  to  foreign  substances  with  no  known \ntherapeutic value—often under false pretenses and with deceptive practices hiding the nature of \nthe interference—is a classic example of invading the core of the bodily integrity protection.   \n                                                 \n3Some defendants contend actual and targeted physical force by a government actor is requisite for a bodily \nintegrity invasion.  But as set forth, the right to bodily integrity’s anchor is control of one’s own person by way of \ninformed consent, and thus the method upon which the government enters the body is irrelevant.

At no time did the government actors disclose the risks associated with the massive \nradiation doses or obtain consent to irradiate the patients at those levels for those purposes—they \ninstead  told  the  patients  that  the  radiation  was  treatment  for  their  cancer.    Id.  at  803–04.  \nSummarizing the caselaw just mentioned, the Cincinnati Radiation court easily concluded that \n“[t]he right to be free of state-sponsored invasion of a person’s bodily integrity is protected by \nthe Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of due process.”  Id. at 810–11.  The involuntary and \nmisleading nature of the intrusions was key.  The patients could not “be said to exercise that \ndegree of free will that is essential to the notion of voluntariness” because:   \n[t]he choice Plaintiffs would have been forced to make was one of life or death.  \nIf  the  Constitution  protects  personal  autonomy  in  making  certain  types  of \nimportant decisions, the decision whether to participate in the Human Radiation \nExperiments was one that each individual Plaintiff was entitled to make freely and \nwith  full  knowledge  of  the  purpose  and  attendant  circumstances  involved.  \nWithout  actually  seizing  the  Plaintiffs  and  forcing  them  to  submit  to  these \nexperiments, the . . . agents of the state[] accomplished the same feat through \ncanard and deception[.]   \nId. at 812 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  Also key was the risk of harm—the \nplaintiffs received “total and partial body radiation, which caused burns, vomiting, diarrhea and \nbone marrow failure, and resulted in death or severe shortening of life.”  Id. at 814.   \nWe  find  the  Cincinnati  Radiation  matter  especially  analogous.    In  both  instances, \nindividuals engaged in  voluntary  actions that they  believed would sustain life, and instead \nreceived substances detrimental to their health.  In both instances, government officials engaged \nin conduct designed to deceive the scope of the bodily invasion.  And in both instances, grievous \nharm occurred.  Based on the facts and principles set forth in the above cases, we therefore agree \nwith the district court that “a government actor violates individuals’ right to bodily integrity by \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 6 P9a6g3e  :   1P2age 16 of (7156 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v.

There  is,  of  course,  “‘no \nfundamental right to water service.’”  In re City of Detroit, 841 F.3d 684, 700 (6th Cir. 2016) \n(quoting Golden v. City of Columbus, 404 F.3d 950, 960 (6th Cir. 2005)).  Moreover, the \nConstitution does not guarantee a right to live in a contaminant-free, healthy environment.  See, \ne.g., Lake v. City of Southgate, 2017 WL 767879, at *4 (E.D. Mich. Feb. 28, 2017) (collecting \ncases).  To this end, several defendants and the dissent cite a California state case involving \nresidents complaining about a city fluoridating its drinking water supply.  See Coshow v. City of \nEscondido, 132 Cal. App. 4th 687, 709 (2005).  However, Coshow is particularly inapposite \nbecause it shows the push-and-pulls of competing policy decisions that generally fall outside the \nscope of a violation of the right to bodily integrity—there, the government publicly introduced \nfluoride into the water system, a chemical frequently added to public water systems to prevent \ntooth decay.  Here, defendants make no contention that causing lead to enter Flint’s drinking \nwater was for the public good or that they provided notice to Flint residents about the lead-laced \nwater.  Therefore, “Coshow did not address whether substantive due-process protections might \nbe implicated in the case of intentional introduction of known contaminants by governmental \nofficials, and its reasoning is inapplicable here.”  Mays, 916 N.W.2d at 262 n.16.   \nB. \nUpon a showing of a deprivation of a constitutionally protected liberty interest, a plaintiff \nmust  show  how  the  government’s  discretionary  conduct  that  deprived  that  interest  was \nconstitutionally repugnant.  See Am. Express Travel Related Servs. Co. v. Kentucky, 641 F.3d \n685, 688 (6th Cir. 2011) (“[A] plaintiff must demonstrate a deprivation of a constitutionally \nprotected liberty or property interest in order to establish a due process violation based on \ndiscretionary conduct of government officials[.]”).  We use the “shocks the conscience” rubric to \nevaluate intrusions into a person’s right to bodily integrity.  Lillard v. Shelby Cty. Bd. of Educ., \n76 F.3d 716, 725 (6th Cir. 1996).  Thus, a “plaintiff must show as a predicate the deprivation of a \nliberty or property interest” and conscience-shocking conduct.  See EJS Props., 698 F.3d at 861; \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 6 P9a6g4e  :   1P3age 17 of (7157 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v.

Several “tropes” help explain \nits meaning, Range, 763 F.3d at 589, with the focus again being on “executive abuse of power.”  \nLewis, 523 U.S. at 846.  Rochin is the “benchmark.”  Id. at 846–47.  Due-process-violative \nconduct (there, forced stomach pumping to obtain evidence) “shocks the conscience,” infringes \nupon the “decencies of civilized conduct,” is “so brutal and so offensive to human dignity,” and \ninterferes with rights “implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.”  Rochin, 342 U.S. at 169, 172–\n74 (citation omitted); see also Lewis, 523 U.S. at 846–47 (collecting authorities).  “These are \nsubjective standards, to be sure, but they make clear that the ‘shocks the conscience’ standard is \nnot a font of tort law, but is instead a way to conceptualize the sort of egregious behavior that \nrises to the level of a substantive due process violation.”  Range, 763 F.3d at 590.  Stated \ndifferently, the shocks-the-conscience test is the way in which courts prevent transforming run-\nof-the-mill tort claims into violations of constitutional guarantees.   \n                                                 \n5In dicta, we stated in Range that “[o]ur case law on substantive due process is somewhat conflicted as to \nwhether an underlying constitutionally-protected right must be established in order for a government action to \nviolate one’s rights by shocking the conscience,” and then cited EJS Properties for the proposition that in non-\nzoning decision contexts “we have held that ‘government action may certainly shock the conscience or violate \nsubstantive due process without a liberty or property interest at stake.’”  763 F.3d at 589 (quoting EJS Props., 698 \nF.3d at 861–62).  For that statement, EJS Properties, in dicta as well, cited two pre-Lewis cases, and more \nimportantly, American Express—a case involving a constitutional challenge to a state law.  698 F.3d at 861–62.  \nRange’s  and  EJS  Properties’  dicta  misconstrue  American  Express,  which  expressly  held  “a  plaintiff  must \ndemonstrate a deprivation of a constitutionally protected liberty or property interest in order to establish a due \nprocess  violation  based  on  discretionary  conduct  of  government  officials,”  unless  the  matter  involves  a \nconstitutional challenge to a state law.

State of Mich., et al.  Page 14 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nTo aid this inquiry, we are to place the alleged heinous conduct on a spectrum, “[t]he \nbookends  [of  which]  present  the  easier  cases.”    Id.    On  the  one  end  is  conduct  that  “is \ncategorically beneath the threshold of constitutional due process,” mere negligence.  Lewis, 523 \nU.S. at 849.  Conduct that is “intended to injure in some way unjustifiable by any government \ninterest” represents the other end, for this behavior “would most probably support a substantive \ndue process claim.”  Id.  We deal here not with these extremes, but rather in the middle, what the \nCourt has deemed “something more than negligence but less than intentional conduct, such as \nrecklessness or gross negligence.”  Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).   \n  This  “middle state[] of culpability  ‘may  or may  not  be shocking depending  on the \ncontext,’” Range, 763 F.3d at 590 (quoting Hunt v. Sycamore Cmty. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ., \n542 F.3d 529, 535 (6th Cir. 2008)), for what may “constitute a denial of fundamental fairness, \nshocking to the universal sense of justice, may, in other circumstances, and in the light of other \nconsiderations, fall short  of such denial,”  Lewis, 523 U.S.  at  850 (quoting  Betts v. Brady, \n316 U.S. 455, 462 (1942)).  “Deliberate indifference that shocks in one environment may not be \nso patently egregious in another, and our concern with preserving the constitutional proportions \nof substantive due process demands an exact analysis of circumstances before any abuse of \npower is condemned as conscience shocking.”  Id.   \n  Lewis delineates this dichotomy.  The issue there was “whether a police officer violates \nthe Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of substantive due process by causing death through \ndeliberate  or  reckless  indifference  to  life  in  a  high-speed  automobile  chase  aimed  at \napprehending a suspected offender.”  Id. at 836.  The Court held that “high-speed chases with no \nintent to harm suspects physically or to worsen their legal plight do not give rise to liability \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment . . . .”  Id. at 854.  In so holding, the Court highlighted how the \ntime to deliberate in one circumstance may dictate liability in one situation but not another \nbecause “[a]s the very term ‘deliberate indifference’ implies, the standard is sensibly employed \nonly when actual deliberation is practical[.]”  Id. at 851.  Take a classic deliberate indifference \nsituation—when, for example, a prison official has “time to make unhurried judgments, [with] \nthe chance for repeated reflection, largely uncomplicated by the pulls of competing obligations.”  \nId.  at  853.    It  is  in  these  kinds  of  situations  where  we  would  expect  plaintiffs  asserting \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 6 P9a6g6e  :   1P5age 19 of (7159 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 15 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nsubstantive due process claims based on deliberate indifference to be most successful.  In rapidly \nevolving situations like prison riots, high-speed chases, and other tense, split-second-reaction-\ndemanding matters, we apply “a much higher standard.”  Id. at 852–54.  We look instead to \nwhether the state actor applies force “maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing \nharm”—in other words, whether he acted with an intent to harm.  Id. at 853.   \n“The critical question in determining the appropriate standard of culpability is whether \nthe circumstances allowed the state actors time to fully consider the potential consequences of \ntheir conduct.”  Ewolski v. City of Brunswick, 287 F.3d 492, 510 (6th Cir. 2002) (internal \nquotation marks and brackets omitted).  This “time to deliberate consideration,” however, does \nnot “transform any reckless action from a tort to conscience-shocking behavior simply because \nthe government actor had time to appreciate any risk of harm.  Time is instead one element in \ndetermining whether the actor’s culpability ‘inches close enough to harmful purpose to spark the \nshock  that  implicates’  substantive  due  process.”    Range,  763  F.3d  at  590  (quoting  Lewis, \n523 U.S. at 853) (brackets omitted).  Our focus instead is upon the entirety of the situation—“the \ntype of harm, the level of risk of the harm occurring, and the time available to consider the risk \nof harm are all necessary factors in determining whether an official was deliberately indifferent.”  \nId. at 591.   \nAfter Lewis, “the key variable is whether actual deliberation is practical, not whether the \nclaimant was in state custody.”  Ewolski, 287 F.3d at 510 n.5.  This is because “[c]ustodial \nsettings . . . are not the only situations in which officials may have a reasonable opportunity to \ndeliberate.”  Id.  But more importantly, even in non-custodial situations, we have stressed that \ndeliberate indifference claims require “something more”:   \n[A] something that we have variously described as callous disregard for the risk \nof injury, or action in an arbitrary manner that shocks the conscience or that \nindicates  an  intent  to  injure.    That  additional  element—be  it  termed  callous \ndisregard  or  intent  to  injure—ensures  that  only  the  most  egregious  official \nconduct can be said to be arbitrary in the constitutional sense.   \nSchroder v. City of Fort Thomas, 412 F.3d 724, 730 (6th Cir. 2005) (internal citations, quotation \nmarks, and brackets omitted).   \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 6 P9a6g7e  :   1P6age 20 of (7250 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 16 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nWe have identified a multitude of considerations when evaluating an official’s alleged \narbitrariness in the constitutional sense, including the time for deliberation, the nature of the \nrelationship between the government and the plaintiff, and whether a legitimate government \npurpose motivated the official’s act.  Hunt, 542 F.3d at 536.  These factors help elucidate Lewis’s \nbroader point that simply making bad choices does not rise to the level of deliberate indifference.  \nRather, “[f]or us to find deliberate indifference, . . . we must find not only that the governmental \nactor chose to act (or failed to act) despite a subjective awareness of substantial risk of serious \ninjury,  but  we  also  must  make  some  assessment  that  he  did  not  act  in  furtherance  of  a \ncountervailing  governmental  purpose  that  justified  taking  that  risk.”    Id.  at  541;  see  also \nSchroder, 412 F.3d at 729 (“Many, if not most, governmental policy choices come with risks \nattached to both of the competing options, and yet ‘it is not a tort for government to govern’ by \npicking one option over another.” (citation omitted)).  “Essentially, the more voluntary the \nplaintiff-government relationship, or the less time the state actor has to deliberate, or the greater \nthe extent to which the state actor is pursuing a legitimate end, the less arbitrary we should deem \na bodily injury or death caused by the state actor.”  Durham v. Estate of Losleben, 744 F. \nApp’x 268, 271 (6th Cir. 2018).  We agree with the district court that these considerations weigh \nin favor of finding that the generally alleged conduct was so egregious that it can be said to be \n“arbitrary in the constitutional sense.” 6   \nExtensive time to deliberate.  There is no doubt that the lead-contamination inflicted upon \nthe people of Flint was a predictable harm striking at the core of plaintiffs’ bodily integrity, and \n                                                 \n6Several defendants suggest we should depart from this line of authorities and instead reject plaintiffs’ \nclaim on the basis of the Supreme Court’s pre-Lewis decision in Collins, where the Supreme Court rejected a \nsubstantive due process claim that “the Federal Constitution imposes a duty on the city to provide its employees \nwith minimal levels of safety and security in the workplace” and the city’s deliberate indifference to employee \nsafety shocked the conscience.  503 U.S. at 125–26.  True, the substantive due process clause “confer[s] no \naffirmative right to government aid, even where such aid may be necessary to secure life, liberty, or property \ninterests of which the government itself may not deprive the individual,” DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 195, nor does it set \na floor for the public’s right to be safe and secure, see Collins, 503 U.S. at 127.  But these general principles have no \napplicability here—this is not a workplace injury case, plaintiffs do not allege Flint was required to provide them \nwith “certain minimal levels of safety and security,” id., and DeShaney itself makes clear in the same token that \ninjuries caused by the state are of a different ilk.  489 U.S. at 195–96.  Nor is there a contention that—unlike many \npublic employees hired to perform inherently dangerous jobs who thus “assumed the risk,” Hunt, 542 F.3d at 538—\nFlint residents voluntarily consumed the water in the face of likely lead-exposure.  For these reasons, our post-\nCollins, pre-Lewis caselaw relied upon by defendants is similarly distinguishable.  See, e.g., Lewellen, 34 F.3d 345; \nUpsher v. Grosse Pointe Pub. Sch. Sys., 285 F.3d 448 (6th Cir. 2002).   \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 6 P9a6g8e  :   1P7age 21 of (7251 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 17 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nthis known risk cannot be excused on the basis of split-second decision making.  All of the \nalleged decisions by defendants leading up to and during the crisis took place over a series of \ndays, weeks, months, and years, and did not arise out of time-is-of-the-essence necessity.  Their \n“unhurried  judgments”  were  replete  with  opportunities  for  “repeated  reflection,  largely \nuncomplicated by the pulls of competing obligations,” and thus militate in plaintiffs’ favor.  \nLewis, 523 at 853; see also Ewolski, 287 F.3d at 511–12.  In the Court’s words, because “[w]hen \nsuch  extended  opportunities  to  do  better  are  teamed  with  protracted  failure  even  to  care, \nindifference is truly shocking.”  Lewis, 523 U.S. at 853.   \nInvoluntary relationship.  In addition to the time to deliberate, the relationship between \nthe City of Flint and its residents matters.  At the outset, we acknowledge we deal here not with \nthe  typical  line  of  voluntary/involuntary  relationships  that  normally  occur  in  our  caselaw.  \nInstead, two factors weigh toward an involuntary relationship.  First, Flint’s transmission of \ndrinking  water  to  its  residents  is  mandatory  on  both  ends—Flint’s  Charter  and  Code  of \nOrdinances mandate that the city supply water to its residents, see, e.g., Flint City Charter § 4-\n203(A), Flint Code of Ord. § 46-7, and as the City expressly argued below, “residents are legally \nrequired to take and pay for the water, unless they use an approved spring or well.”  See Flint \nCode of Ord. §§ 46-50(b), 46-51, 46-52.  Second, various defendants’ assurances of the water’s \npotability  hid  the  risks,  turning  residents’  voluntary  consumption  of  a  substance  vital  to \nsubsistence into an involuntary and unknowing act of self-contamination.  As the district court \naptly reasoned, “[m]isleading Flint’s residents as to the water’s safety—so that they would \ncontinue to drink the water and Flint could continue to draw water from the Flint River—is no \ndifferent than the forced, involuntary invasions of bodily integrity that the Supreme Court has \ndeemed unconstitutional.”  (Citations omitted).7   \nNo legitimate government purpose.  The decision to temporarily switch Flint’s water \nsource was an economic one and there is no doubt that reducing cost is a legitimate government \npurpose.  See, e.g., Garrett v. Lyng, 877 F.2d 472, 476 (6th Cir. 1989).  When a government acts \n                                                 \n7See also Briscoe v. Potter, 355 F. Supp. 2d 30, 45–47 (D.D.C. 2004) (holding that plaintiffs sufficiently \nalleged conscience-shocking conduct where defendants knew a post office distribution center was contaminated with \nanthrax, made affirmative misrepresentations about the facility’s safety, and coerced plaintiffs into continuing to \nwork at the facility). \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 6 P9a6g9e  :   1P8age 22 of (7252 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v.

There is a caveat to this general rule—acting merely upon a government \ninterest does not remove an actor’s decision from the realm of unconstitutional arbitrariness.  Id. \nat 543 (“[W]e have held open the possibility that in extreme cases the governmental actor’s \nchoice  to  endanger  a  plaintiff  in  the  service  of  a  countervailing  duty  would  be  deemed \narbitrary[.]”).  Here, jealously guarding the public’s purse cannot, under any circumstances, \njustify the yearlong contamination of an entire community.  In the words of the Michigan Court \nof Appeals, “we can conceive of no legitimate governmental objective for this violation of \nplaintiffs’ bodily integrity.”  Mays, 916 N.W.2d at 262.  (Some defendants contend their actions \nwere motivated by other legitimate government purposes, and we address their positions below.) \nThere is no allegation defendants intended to harm Flint residents.  Accordingly, the \nquestion is whether defendants acted with “[d]eliberate indifference in the constitutional sense,” \nRange, 763 F.3d at 591, which we have “equated with subjective recklessness,” Ewolski, 287 \nF.3d at 513 (citing Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 837 (1994)).  This is a particularly high \nhurdle, for plaintiffs must show the government officials “knew of facts from which they could \ninfer  a  ‘substantial  risk  of  serious  harm,’  that  they  did  infer  it,  and  that  they  acted  with \nindifference ‘toward the individual’s rights.’”  Range, 763 F.3d at 591 (citation omitted).  The \ndeliberate-indifference  standard  requires  an  assessment  of  each  defendant’s  alleged  actions \nindividually.  See Bishop v. Hackel, 636 F.3d 757, 767 (6th Cir. 2011).  Our focus is on each \nindividual defendant’s conduct, their “subjective awareness of substantial risk of serious injury,” \nand whether their actions were made “in furtherance of a countervailing governmental purpose \nthat justified taking that risk.”  Hunt, 542 F.3d at 541.   \nC. \n  Flint defendants (Earley, Ambrose, and Croft).

Earley, for example, “forced the transition through” \ndespite knowing how important it was that “the treatment plant be ready to treat Flint River \nwater” and that “[t]he treatment plant was not ready.”  Similarly, Croft permitted the water’s \nflow  despite  knowing  “that  the  City’s  water  treatment  plant  was  unprepared  to  adequately \nprovide safe drinking water to Flint’s residents.”  The Flint defendants also made numerous \nstatements to the public proclaiming that the water was safe to drink.  Defendant Ambrose’s \ndecisions to twice turn down opportunities to reconnect to the DWSD after he knew of the \nsignificant problems with the water were especially egregious.  These and other asserted actions \nplausibly allege deliberate indifference and “plain[] incompeten[ce]” not warranting qualified \nimmunity.  al-Kidd, 563 U.S. at 743 (citation omitted).  To the extent these defendants claim \n“mistakes  in  judgment”  because  they  reasonably  relied  upon  the  opinions  of  Michigan \nDepartment of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) employees and professional engineering firms, \nsee Pearson, 555 U.S. at 231, those are facts to be fleshed out during discovery and are not \nappropriate to resolve at the motion-to-dismiss posture.  See, e.g., Wesley, 779 F.3d at 433–34.   \n  The dissent concludes that Ambrose and Earley were merely “rel[ying] on expert advice” \nand therefore their actions could not demonstrate a callous disregard for plaintiffs.  However, this \nconclusion ignores Wesley’s guidance not to resolve such issues at the motion-to-dismiss stage.  \nIt  also  ignores  our  obligation  to  accept  plaintiffs’  allegations  as  true  and  draw  reasonable \ninferences from those allegations.  One can place a benign construction on the factual allegations \nand draw inferences so that the facts amount to a negligent mismanagement of priorities and \nrisks; but the allegations also support a reasonable inference that Earley prioritized a drive to cut \ncosts with deliberate and reckless indifference to the likely results, and Ambrose refused to \nreconnect to Detroit water despite knowing the substantial risk to Flint residents’ health.   \nFor  now,  we  conclude  that  plaintiffs’  complaint  plausibly  alleges  a  constitutional \nviolation as to these defendants.   \nD. \nMDEQ Defendants (Busch, Shekter-Smith, Prysby, Wurfel, and Wyant).  The MDEQ \ndefendants were the other set of individuals front and center during the crisis.  The allegations \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 6 P9a7g1e  :   2P0age 24 of (7254 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 20 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nagainst defendants Busch, Shekter-Smith, Prysby, and Wurfel are numerous and substantial.  \nThese MDEQ defendants played a pivotal role in authorizing Flint to use its ill-prepared water \ntreatment plant to distribute drinking water from a river they knew was rife with public-health-\ncompromising complications.  Furthermore, when faced with the consequences of their actions, \nthey falsely assured the public that the water was safe and attempted to refute assertions to the \ncontrary.  A few poignant examples further illustrate their culpability:   \n•  Less than two weeks before the switch to Flint water, the Flint water treatment \nplant’s  water  quality  supervisor  wrote  to  Prysby  and  Busch  that  he  had \ninadequate staff and resources to properly monitor the water.  As a result, he \ninformed Prysby and Busch, “I do not anticipate giving the OK to begin \nsending water out anytime soon.  If water is distributed from this plant in the \nnext couple of weeks, it will be against my direction.”  Busch and Prysby did \nnot act on this warning.  Instead, a few days later, Busch drafted a talking \npoint  for  a  Flint  community  meeting  that  highlighted  that  MDEQ  was \n“satisfied with the City’s ability to treat water from the Flint River.”   \n•  After General Motors very publicly stopped using Flint River water at its \nengine  plant  for  fear  of  corrosion,  Prysby  made  sure  the  department’s \napproach was to spin this symptom as not related to public health instead of \ninvestigating the underlying problem.  He “stressed the importance of not \nbranding Flint’s water as ‘corrosive’ from a public health standpoint simply \nbecause it does not meet a manufacturing facility’s limit for production.”   \n•  On February 27, 2015, Busch lied when he told “the EPA on behalf of MDEQ \nthat  the  Flint  Water  Treatment  Plant  had  an  optimized  corrosion  control \nprogram.”  However, Busch knew “[b]y no later than April 2015, but likely \nmuch earlier . . . that no corrosion control was being used in Flint following \nthe switch to the Flint River as the water source.”  (Emphasis added).   \n•  In  the  midst  of  the  crisis  and  with  full  knowledge  that  Flint’s  water \ndistribution  system  was  corroded  and  presented  significant  health  issues, \nShekter-Smith callously excused Flint’s lack of drinking water compliance as \n“circumstances happen.”  And after the EPA pressed MDEQ officials for \nMDEQ’s failure to optimize corrosion controls in July 2015, she requested the \nEPA nonetheless cover her department’s decision by “indicat[ing] in writing \n. . . [its] concurrence that the city is in compliance with the lead and copper \nrule . . . .”  Doing so, she wrote, “would help distinguish between [MDEQ’s] \ngoals to address important public health issues separately from the compliance \nrequirements of the actual rule which we believe have been and continue to be \nmet in the city of Flint.”  In other words, “technical compliance” trumped \naddressing an urgent and catastrophic public health disaster.   \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 6 P9a7g2e  :   2P1age 25 of (7255 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 21 \n/1752 /1769 \n \n•  On  numerous  occasions,  defendant  Wurfel,  the  public  face  of  the  crisis, \nannounced  the  water  was  safe  to  drink,  and  demeaned,  belittled,  and \naggressively dampened attempts by the scientific community to challenge the \ngovernment’s assertions that Flint did not have a problem with its drinking \nwater.  And he suggested that concern regarding the water was at best a short-\nterm problem—that by the time the City had completed its lead-testing, the \nCity would already be drawing from a different water source altogether.   \nAs  with  the  Flint  defendants,  these  MDEQ  defendants  created  the  Flint  Water \nenvironmental disaster and then intentionally attempted to cover-up their grievous decision.  \nTheir actions shock our conscience.  It is alleged that these defendants acted with deliberate \nindifference to the plaintiffs’ constitutional right to bodily integrity and at a minimum were \nplainly incompetent.   \nTo the extent these defendants made “honest mistakes in judgment”—in law or fact—in \ninterpreting and applying the Lead and Copper Rule, see, e.g., Pearson, 555 U.S. at 231, that \ndefense is again best reserved for after discovery.  See, e.g., Wesley, 779 F.3d at 433–34.  This \nRule generally requires public water systems to monitor lead and copper levels and to treat \ncertain elevated levels in accordance with the regulation.  40 C.F.R. § 141.80 et. seq.  More \nspecifically, it requires a “large system,” like Flint, to optimize corrosion control treatment \nbefore distribution of water to the public.  § 141.81(a)(1).  However, MDEQ employees did not \nfollow this dictate; instead, under a “flawed interpretation” of the Rule, they drew up a yearlong \nsampling program post-switch (broken up into two, six-month monitoring periods) to determine \nwhether  corrosion  controls  were  required.    In  their  view,  this  after-the-fact-wait-and-see \napproach to corrosion controls allegedly fell within minimum compliance levels of the Rule.  \nPlaintiffs’ view is bleaker.  They assert MDEQ viewed Flint residents as “guinea pigs” for a year \nto test lead-compliance theories that were unsupported and unauthorized by the EPA just to pass \ntime until water began flowing from a new water authority.  To be sure, plaintiffs’ view must be \nbased on reasonable inferences from factual allegations.  The district court correctly found that it \nis.   \nBy the same token, we reject Wurfel’s reliance upon two Second Circuit cases involving \nstatements by public officials about the air-quality in lower Manhattan in the days following the \nSeptember 11 terrorist attacks, see Lombardi v. Whitman, 485 F.3d 73 (2d Cir. 2007) and \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 6 P9a7g3e  :   2P2age 26 of (7256 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 22 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nBenzman v. Whitman, 523 F.3d 119 (2d Cir. 2008), chiefly for the reason that those matters \ninvolved  the  balancing  of  competing  governmental  interests—restoring  public  services  and \nprotecting public health—during a time-sensitive environmental emergency.  We have no such \nsimilar facts here on the face of plaintiffs’ complaint.   \nThe dissent again asks us to view plaintiffs’ allegations in a light favorable to defendants, \narguing that Shekter-Smith, Busch, and Prysby simply “misinterpreted the [EPA’s] Lead and \nCopper Rule” and provided “misguided advice rooted in mistaken interpretations of the law.”  \nBut plaintiffs’ allegations, which we must accept, are that Busch, Shekter-Smith, and Prysby \nauthorized use of Flint River water with knowledge of its contaminants and then deceived others \nto hide the fact of contamination.  Moreover, it is improper to conclude at this stage that Shekter-\nSmith, Busch, and Prysby merely misinterpreted the Lead and Copper Rule because plaintiffs \nallege that the EPA informed them that they  were not  complying with  EPA requirements, \nproviding them with a memorandum that “identified the problem, the cause of that problem, and \nthe specific reason the state missed it.”  In response, “Defendants ignored and dismissed” the \nmemorandum.  Although the dissent claims that plaintiffs’ factual allegations do not support that \nWurfel’s statements were knowing lies, that is a reasonable inference from plaintiffs’ factual \nallegations.   \n  We  cannot  say  the  same  with  respect  to  defendant  Director  Wyant  based  on  the \nallegations in the complaint.  At most, plaintiffs claim Wyant was aware of some of the issues \narising with the water supply post-switch and admitted his department’s “colossal failure” after \nthe City reconnected to DWSD.  Plaintiffs do not plausibly allege Wyant personally made \ndecisions regarding the water-source switch, nor do they allege he personally engaged in any \nother conduct that we find conscience-shocking.  In short, while the conduct of individuals \nwithin his department was constitutionally abhorrent, we may only hold Wyant accountable for \nhis own conduct, not the misconduct of his subordinates.  See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, \n676–77 (2009).  For this reason, the district court erred in denying defendant Wyant’s motion to \ndismiss.   \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 6 P9a7g4e  :   2P3age 27 of (7257 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 23 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nE. \nMDHHS Executives (Lyon and Wells).  In the complaint before us, plaintiffs’ allegations \nagainst Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) Director Lyon and \nChief Medical Executive Wells are minimal.  The complaint sets forth no facts connecting Lyon \nand Wells to the switch to the Flint River or the decision not to treat the water, and there is no \nallegation that they took any action causing plaintiffs to consume the lead-contaminated water.  \nInstead, plaintiffs claim generally that Lyon and Wells failed to “protect and notify the public” of \nthe problems with Flint’s water shortly before Flint switched back to DWSD.  However, the Due \nProcess Clause is a limitation only on government action.  See DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 195.   \nWe are thus left with allegations of at most questionable actions by Lyon and Wells.  The \nsole allegation against Lyon is that he attempted to “discredit” a study by Dr. Mona Hanna-\nAttisha, a pediatrician at Hurley Medical Center in Flint, showing significant increases of blood \nlead levels in children post-water-source switch.8  Paragraph 289 of plaintiffs’ complaint sets \nforth plaintiffs’ entire case against Lyon:   \nMDHHS Director Nick Lyon continues trying to discredit Dr. Hanna-Attisha’s \nstudy despite his own department’s knowledge that it shows a real problem.  In an \ne-mail, he stated: “I need an analysis of the Virginia Tech/Hurley data and their \nconclusions.  I would like to make a strong statement with a demonstration of \nproof  that  the  lead  blood  levels  seen  are  not  out  of  the  ordinary  and  are \nattributable to seasonal fluctuations.  Geralyn is working on this for me but she \nneeds someone in public health who can work directly with her on immediate \nconcerns/questions.”   \nAnd the two main factual allegations against Wells are equally sparse:   \n•  On September 29, 2015, Wells received an email from an MDHHS employee \nasking, “Is it possible to get the same type of data for just children under the \nage of six?  So basically, the city of Flint kids ages six and under with the \nsame type of approach as the attached chart you gave us last week?”  Another \n                                                 \n8They  also  allege  Lyon  “participated  in,  directed,  and/or  oversaw  the  department’s  efforts  to  hide \ninformation to save face, and to obstruct and discredit the efforts of outside researchers.  He knew as early as 2014 \nof problems with lead and legionella contamination in Flint’s water and instead of fulfilling his duty to protect and \nnotify the public, he participated in hiding this information.”  (Plaintiffs make the same general allegation against \nWells.)  But this is precisely the type of “chimerical,” “bare assertion[]” Iqbal requires we set aside.  556 U.S. at \n681. \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 6 P9a7g5e  :   2P4age 28 of (7258 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 24 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nemployee responded that “[i]t’s bad enough to have a data war with outside \nentities, we absolutely cannot engage in competing data analyses within the \nDepartment, or, heaven forbid, in public releases.”  Dr. Wells replied “Agree.”  \nPlaintiffs claim this “show[ed] MDHHS continuing efforts to mislead the \npublic, protect itself, and discredit Dr. Hanna-Attisha.”   \n•  In response to an email from Dr. Hanna-Attisha showing the tripling of blood \nlead levels, Wells “responded that the state was working to replicate Hanna- \nAttisha’s analysis, and inquired about Dr. Hanna-Attisha’s plans to take the \ninformation  public.”    According  to  plaintiffs,  this  shows  that  “[w]hile \ndiscouraging her department to look further into Dr. Hanna-Attisha’s findings \nand misleading Dr. Hanna-Attisha, Defendant Wells remained focused on a \nsingle task; saving face at the expense of Flint’s residents.”   \nAt most, plaintiffs have alleged Lyon and Wells were unjustifiably skeptical of Dr. Hanna-\nAttisha’s study and were hoping to assemble evidence to disprove it.  This falls well-short of \nconscience-shocking conduct and therefore the district court erred in denying their motions to \ndismiss.   \nF. \nMDHHS Employees (Peeler and Scott).  That leaves us with two MDHHS employees, \nNancy Peeler and Robert Scott, who jointly worked on projects within MDHHS designed to \neliminate lead exposure.  As with Lyon and Wells, the allegations against Peeler and Scott relate \nnot to the switch of water sources, but to how they processed—or rather did not process—data \nrelating to lead exposure more than a year later.   \nIn general, plaintiffs allege Peeler and Scott “participated in, directed, and/or oversaw the \ndepartment’s  efforts  to  hide  information  to  save  face,  and  actively  sought  to  obstruct  and \ndiscredit the efforts of outside researchers.  Even when [their] own department had data that \nverified outside evidence of a lead contamination problem, [they] continued trying to generate \nevidence  to  the  contrary.”    Scott  “also  served  a  key  role  in  withholding  and/or  delaying \ndisclosure of data that outside researchers needed to protect the people of Flint.”  In support of \nthese general allegations, plaintiffs point to the following:   \n•  Beginning in July 2015, Peeler learned there was “an uptick in children with \nelevated blood lead levels in Flint in July, August, and September 2014,” but \nattributed it to “seasonal variation” instead of the water-source switch.   \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 6 P9a7g6e  :   2P5age 29 of (7259 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 25 \n/1752 /1769 \n \n•  On September 11, 2015, Robert Scott e-mailed a copy of a grant proposal by a \nVirginia Tech professor, Marc Edwards, that “described a ‘perfect storm’ of \n‘out  of  control’  corrosion  of  city  water  pipes  leading  to  ‘severe \nchemical/biological  health  risks for  Flint  residents’” to  Peeler and others.  \nScott stated, “When you have a few minutes, you might want to take a look at \nit.  Sounds like there might be more to this than what we learned previously.  \nYikes!”   \n•  Following Dr. Hanna-Attisha’s study, Scott “tried to recreate [her] numbers,” \nsaw “a difference”—“but not as much difference” as found by Dr. Hanna-\nAttisha—in children’s lead-levels pre-and post-switch, but told Peeler that he \nwas “sure this one is not for the public.”   \n•  Scott, Peeler, and another MDHHS colleague corresponded about a Detroit \nFree Press story on Dr. Hanna-Attisha’s study.  Scott wrote, “The best I could \nsay is something like this: ‘While the trend for Michigan as a whole has \nshown a steady decrease in lead poisoning year by year, smaller areas such as \nthe city of Flint  have their bumps from  year to  year while still trending \ndownward overall.’”  Peeler chimed in that her “secret hope is that we can \nwork in the fact that this pattern is similar to the recent past.”  In plaintiffs’ \nview,  this  correspondence  shows  Peeler  and  Scott  “intentionally  withheld \ninformation that they had a duty to disclose to the public, and actively sought \nto  hide  the  lead  poisoning  epidemic  that  they  had  previously  failed  to \ndiscover.”   \n•  Scott drafted an apology email to Prof. Edwards explaining why he failed to \nrespond to multiple requests for state data.  His unsent email to Edwards \nexplained that he “worked with you earlier this month to get data to you \nrelatively quickly but did not manage to complete the process before I went on \nannual leave for several days.  I neglected to inform you that I’d be away, and \nI apologize for not informing you.’”  Scott did not send the email to Edwards \nafter Peeler told him to “apologize less,” “despite,” in plaintiffs’ words, “the \nfact that Scott admitted to going on vacation and leaving an unimportant task \nunfinished as a public health crisis unfolded.”   \nIn total, plaintiffs’ allegations against Scott and Peeler are:  (1) after Dr. Hanna-Attisha \nreleased her study on September 24, 2015, Scott tried to “recreate” the study, found a smaller \ndifference in children’s lead levels than Dr. Hanna-Attisha’s study, and concluded his results \nwere “not for the public”; (2) Scott did not timely provide researchers with requested data; \n(3) Peeler and Scott knew that elevated lead levels could have been due to corrosion in the city \nwater pipes; and (4) both sought to  attribute it to regular fluctuations.  In our view, these \nallegations do not rise to the level of “callous disregard”; plaintiffs do not factually link Scott’s \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 6 P9a7g7e  :   2P6age 30 of (7350 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 26 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nand Peeler’s inaction to causing Flint residents to consume (or continue to consume) lead-tainted \nwater.  Nor do plaintiffs identify a source of law for the proposition that an individual violates \nthe right to bodily integrity just because he failed to “blow the whistle.”  Plaintiffs have therefore \nnot plausibly alleged Scott and Peeler engaged in conscience-shocking conduct.   \nIn sum, the district court erred in finding that plaintiffs adequately alleged that defendants \nWyant, Lyon, Wells, Peeler, and Scott violated plaintiffs’ substantive due process right to bodily \nintegrity,  but  correctly  held  plaintiffs  plausibly  alleged  such  a  violation  against  defendants \nEarley, Ambrose, Croft, Busch, Shekter-Smith, Prysby, and Wurfel.   \nVI. \nA right is “clearly established” when its “contours . . . [are] sufficiently clear that a \nreasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.”  Anderson v. \nCreighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640 (1987).  Notice to officials is paramount; “the salient question” in \nevaluating the clearly established prong is whether officials had “fair warning” that their conduct \nwas unconstitutional.  Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 741 (2002).  In making this determination, \n“we must look first to decisions of the Supreme Court, then to decisions of this court and other \ncourts within our circuit, and finally to decisions of other circuits.”  Baker v. City of Hamilton, \n471 F.3d 601, 606 (6th Cir. 2006) (quotation omitted).   \nPlaintiffs must generally identify a case with a fact pattern similar enough to have given \n“fair and clear warning to officers” about what the law requires.  White v. Pauly, 137 S. Ct. 548, \n552 (2017) (per curiam) (quotation omitted); see also Arrington-Bey v. City of Bedford Heights, \n858 F.3d 988, 993 (6th Cir. 2017).  But such a case need not “be on all fours in order to form the \nbasis for the clearly established right.”  See Burgess v. Fischer, 735 F.3d 462, 474 (6th Cir. \n2013).  We do not require a prior, “precise situation,” Sutton, 700 F.3d at 876, a finding that “the \nvery action in question has previously been held unlawful,” Comstock v. McCrary, 273 F.3d 693, \n702 (6th Cir. 2001) (internal quotation marks omitted), or a “case directly on point.”  al-Kidd, \n563 U.S. at 741.  Instead, the test is whether “existing precedent must have placed the . . . \nconstitutional  question beyond debate.”   Id.   This  means there must either be  “controlling \nauthority or a robust consensus of cases of persuasive authority.”  Plumhoff v. Rickard, 134 S. \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 6 P9a7g8e  :   2P7age 31 of (7351 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 27 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nCt. 2012, 2023 (2014) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Finally, “an action’s unlawfulness can \nbe ‘clearly established’ from direct holdings, from specific examples describing certain conduct \nas prohibited, or from the general reasoning that a court employs.”  Baynes v. Cleland, 799 F.3d \n600, 612 (6th Cir. 2015) (citing Hope, 536 U.S. at 742–44).   \nGiven the unique circumstances of this case, defendants argue we should defer to the \n“breathing room” qualified immunity provides and hold that the invasion of plaintiffs’ right to \nbodily  integrity  via  life-threatening  substances  with  no  therapeutic  benefit  introduced  into \nindividuals without their consent was not clearly established before the officials engaged in their \nrespective conduct.  The dissent likewise suggests that “plaintiffs must be able to ‘identify a case \nwith a similar fact pattern’ to this one ‘that would have given ‘fair and clear warning to officers’ \nabout what the law requires.’”  (Quoting Arrington-Bey, 858 F.3d at 993 (quoting White, 137 S. \nCt. at 552)).  But the Court has “mad[e] clear that officials can still be on notice that their \nconduct violates established law even in novel factual circumstances.”  Hope, 536 U.S. at 741; \nsee also White, 137 S. Ct. at 552 (noting that “general statements of the law are not inherently \nincapable  of  giving  fair  and  clear  warning”  where  the  unlawfulness  is  apparent  (citation \nomitted)).  For the reasons that follow, we decline to erect the suggested “absolute barrier to \nrecovering damages against an individual government actor.”  Bletz, 641 F.3d at 756 (citation \nomitted).   \nThe lack of a comparable government-created public health disaster precedent does not \ngrant defendants a qualified immunity shield.  Rather, it showcases the grievousness of their \nalleged conduct:  “The easiest cases don’t even arise,” United States v. Lanier, 520 U.S. 259, 271 \n(1997) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); “there is no need that the very action in \nquestion [have] previously been held unlawful” because “[t]he unconstitutionality of outrageous \nconduct obviously will be unconstitutional,” Safford Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 v. Redding, 557 \nU.S. 364, 377 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted); and “[s]ome personal liberties are so \nfundamental to human dignity as to need no specific explication in our Constitution in order to \nensure their protection against government invasion.”  Brannum v.

Wells, \n345 F.3d 441, 446 (6th Cir. 2003).  As set forth above, taking affirmative steps to systematically \ncontaminate a  community through its public water supply with  deliberate indifference is  a \ngovernment invasion of the highest magnitude.  Any reasonable official should have known that \ndoing so constitutes conscience-shocking conduct prohibited by the substantive due process \nclause.9  These “actions violate the heartland of the constitutional guarantee” to the right of \nbodily integrity, Stemler v. City of Florence, 126 F.3d 856, 867 (6th Cir. 1997), and “t[he] \nobvious  cruelty  inherent”  in  defendants’  conduct  should  have  been  enough  to  forewarn \ndefendants.  Hope, 536 U.S. at 745.   \nFurthermore, the long line of Supreme Court cases discussed above—Harper, Cruzan, \nRochin, Winston, to name a few—all build on each other from one foundation:  an individual’s \nright to bodily integrity is sacred, founded upon informed consent, and may be invaded only \nupon a showing of a government interest.  The Court could not have been clearer in Harper \nwhen it stated that “[t]he forcible injection of medication into a nonconsenting person’s body \nrepresents a substantial interference with that person’s liberty.”  494 U.S. at 229.  Here we have \nan even more dramatic invasion, for at least in Harper the state forced medication—something \nneeded to improve or sustain life—into its citizens; here, government officials caused Flint \nresidents to consume a toxin with no known benefit, did so without telling them, and made \naffirmative representations that the water was safe to drink.   \nThe same can be gleaned from Cruzan.  If the common law right to informed consent is \nto mean anything, reasoned the Court, it must include “the right of a competent individual to \nrefuse medical treatment.”  497 U.S. at 277.  If an individual has a right to refuse to ingest \nmedication, then surely she has a right to refuse to ingest a life necessity.  Cruzan instructs as \nmuch,  recognizing  that  the  “logic”  of  its  bodily  integrity  cases—i.e.,  the  reasoning—\n                                                 \n9See also Wright v.

And if an individual has a right to refuse the consumption of beneficial water, then \ncertainly any reasonable official would understand that an individual has a right to refuse the \nconsumption  of  water  known  to  be  lead-contaminated,  especially  when  those  individuals \ninvolved in tainting the water simultaneously vouched for its safety.  Put differently, plaintiffs’ \nbodily integrity claim implicates a clearly established right that “may be inferred from [the \nSupreme Court’s] prior decisions.”  Id. at 278.  Before Cruzan, a factually identical case had not \nbeen decided by the Court.  Nonetheless, the Supreme Court held that the right to bodily integrity \nclaim there was compelled by the logic and reasonable inferences of its prior decisions.  Id. at \n270, 278–79.  The same is true here.   \nSeveral defendants take issue with the district court’s definition of the right, contending it \ndeals in generality instead of specificity.  See, e.g., al-Kidd, 563 U.S. at 742 (admonishing courts \n“not to define clearly established law at a high level of generality”).  Our focus, of course, is \n“whether the violative nature of particular conduct is clearly established . . . in light of the \nspecific context of the case.”  Mullenix v. Luna, 136 S. Ct. 305, 308 (2015) (per curiam) (internal \nquotation marks omitted).  To be sure, sweeping statements about constitutional rights do not \nprovide officials with the requisite notice.  “For example,” the Supreme Court has told us, “the \nright to due process of law is quite clearly established by the Due Process Clause, and thus there \nis a sense in which any action that violates that Clause (no matter how unclear it may be that the \nparticular action is a violation) violates a clearly established right.”  Anderson, 483 U.S. at 639.  \nBut, the deficiencies of a too-general clearly established test have no bearing on the specifics of \nthis case.  Here, the right recognized by the district court—and one we adopt as directly flowing \nfrom the reasoning of the long line of bodily integrity and shocks-the-conscience cases—is \nneither a “general proposition” nor one “lurking in the broad ‘history and purposes’” of the \nsubstantive due process clause.  al-Kidd, 563 U.S. at 742.  “Any other result would allow Hope’s \nfear of ‘rigid, overreliance on factual similarity’ in analyzing the ‘clearly established’ prong of \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 6 P9a8g1e  :   3P0age 34 of (7354 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v.

Doe, 103 F.3d at 507.  They also caused parents to strip their children of their own \npersonhood.  If ever there was an egregious violation of the right to bodily integrity, this is the \ncase; the “affront to human dignity in this case is compelling,” United States v. Booker, 728 F.3d \n535, 546 (6th Cir. 2013), and defendants’ “conduct is so contrary to fundamental notions of \nliberty and so lacking of any redeeming social value, that no rational individual could believe . . . \n[their conduct] is constitutionally permissible under the Due Process Clause.”  Doe, 103 F.3d at \n507.  We therefore agree with the district court that plaintiffs have properly pled a violation of \nthe right  to  bodily integrity against Howard Croft,  Darnell Earley, Gerald  Ambrose,  Liane \nShekter-Smith, Stephen Busch, Michael Prysby, and Bradley Wurfel, and that the right was \nclearly established at the time of their conduct.  Should discovery shed further light on the \nreasons behind their actions (as but one example, a governmental interest that trumps plaintiffs’ \nright to bodily integrity), they are free to raise the qualified immunity defense again at the \nsummary judgment stage.  See, e.g., Miller v. Maddox, 866 F.3d 386, 390 (6th Cir. 2017); see \nalso Wesley, 779 F.3d at 433–34.11 \n                                                 \n10Some defendants and the dissent direct us to dicta in a recent District of New Jersey case involving a \nbodily integrity claim arising out of the discovery of leaded water in the Newark, New Jersey’s public-school \nbuildings.  See Branch v. Christie, 2018 WL 337751 (D.N.J. Jan. 8, 2018).  We are not obligated to give this \ndecision, let alone its dicta, any persuasive value.  See Baker, 471 F.3d at 606.  The opinion is bereft of any \nsubstantive analysis regarding the right to bodily integrity, and wholly omits discussion of the Supreme Court cases \nmentioned in detail here.  It is also factually distinct in at least one major aspect—here, the government officials \nparticipated in the decision to taint Flint’s water-supply in the first instance; there, the government officials failed to \ntake action upon discovery of the leaded water.   \n11We deny plaintiffs’ pending motion to take judicial notice of pending but unproven criminal charges \nagainst some of the defendants and note that that the district court erred in doing so and using them to justify \ndenying qualified immunity.  First, although courts may consider judicially noticed facts when evaluating motions to \ndismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), see, e.g., Buck v. Thomas M. Cooley Law Sch., 597 F.3d \n812, 816 (6th Cir. 2010), we have held that a “criminal indictment qualifies as a matter outside the pleading” \ntherefore necessitating conversion to a Rule 56 motion.  Rose v. Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co., 203 F.3d 417, 420 \n(6th Cir. 2000) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted).  Second, it was error for the district court to \nconsider the charges for qualified-immunity purposes without engaging in the proper analysis.  The Supreme Court \nhas made clear that “[o]fficials sued for constitutional violations do not lose their qualified immunity merely \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 6 P9a8g2e  :   3P1age 35 of (7355 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 31 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nVII. \n  The final issue is  Flint’s claim  that the district  court  erred in  denying it sovereign \nimmunity.  The Eleventh Amendment provides that “[t]he Judicial power of the United States \nshall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against \none of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign \nState.”  U.S. Const. amend. XI.  It bars suits against a state by its own citizens, and by citizens of \nanother state.  See, e.g., Bd. of Trs. of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 363 (2001).  “The \nultimate guarantee of the Eleventh Amendment is that nonconsenting States may not be sued by \nprivate individuals in federal court.”  Id.   \nFlint, obviously, is not a state; it is a municipality incorporated under the laws of the State \nof Michigan.  See People v. Pickett, 63 N.W.2d 681, 684 (Mich. 1954).  The Supreme Court \ncould not be clearer in demarcating between states and their political subdivisions for sovereign \nimmunity purposes:  “The bar of the Eleventh Amendment to suit in federal court extends to \nStates and state officials in appropriate circumstances, but does not extend to counties and \nsimilar municipal corporations.”  Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. \n274, 280 (1977) (internal citations omitted); see also Jinks v. Richland Cty., 538 U.S. 456, 466 \n(2003) (“[M]unicipalities, unlike States, do not enjoy a constitutionally protected immunity from \nsuit.”).  We have even noted this contrast in one of our previous Flint Water Crisis cases, stating \nin dicta that the Eleventh Amendment does not apply to “the defendants associated with the City \nof Flint.”  Boler, 865 F.3d at 410.   \nFlint readily concedes municipalities do not enjoy sovereign immunity.  That would \nnormally end our analysis, but this is not a typical case.  At the time of the crisis, Flint was so \nfinancially distressed that the State of Michigan had taken over its day-to-day local government \noperations  by  way  of  a  statutory  mechanism  enacted  to  deal  with  municipal  insolvency—\ngubernatorial-appointed individuals who “act for and in the place and stead of the governing \n                                                                                                                                                             \nbecause their conduct violates some statutory . . . provision.”  Davis v. Scherer, 468 U.S. 183, 194 (1984).  Instead, \ngovernment officials are “liable for damages only to the extent that there is a clear violation of the statutory rights \nthat give rise to the cause of action for damages.”  Id. at 194 n.12.  They do not “lose their immunity by violating the \nclear command of a statute . . . unless that statute . . . provides the basis for the cause of action sued upon.”  Id.  \nHere, the district court failed to consider whether the charges could be considered under this standard.   \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 6 P9a8g3e  :   3P2age 36 of (7356 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v.

Snyder,  836  F.3d  707,  711–12  (6th  Cir.  2016) \n(summarizing Michigan’s Local Financial Stability and Choice Act (or Public Act 436)).  Flint \ncontends it became an arm of the state because of the State of Michigan’s takeover.  We thus \nfind it more appropriate to resolve whether this extraordinary factor dictates a different outcome.  \nSee  Monell  v.  Dep’t  of  Soc.  Servs.  of  City  of  New  York,  436  U.S.  658,  690  n.54  (1978) \n(suggesting that under some circumstances, local governmental units could be “considered part \nof the State for Eleventh Amendment purposes”).  On de novo review, see Babcock v. Michigan, \n812 F.3d 531, 533 (6th Cir. 2016), we agree with the district court that the City of Flint is not \nentitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity.12   \nA. \n“The entity asserting Eleventh Amendment immunity has the burden to show that it is \nentitled to immunity, i.e., that it is an arm of the state.”  Lowe v. Hamilton Cty. Dep’t of Job & \nFamily Servs., 610 F.3d 321, 324 (6th Cir. 2010) (brackets and citation omitted).  We have \nidentified four factors relevant to “whether an entity is an ‘arm of the State’ on the one hand or a \n‘political subdivision’ on the other”:  “(1) the State’s potential liability for a judgment against the \nentity; (2) the language by which state statutes, and state courts refer to the entity and the degree \nof state control and veto power over the entity’s actions; (3) whether state or local officials \nappoint the board members of the entity; and (4) whether the entity’s functions fall within the \ntraditional purview of state or local government.”  Ernst v. Rising, 427 F.3d 351, 359 (6th Cir. \n2005) (en banc) (internal citations omitted).   \nWe have characterized the first  factor—the state’s potential liability for a judgment \nagainst the entity—as “the foremost,” id., the “most salient,” Town of Smyrna v. Mun. Gas Auth. \nof Ga., 723 F.3d 640, 651 (6th Cir. 2013), and one creating “a strong presumption” on the issue.  \nKreipke v. Wayne State Univ., 807 F.3d 768, 777 (6th Cir. 2015).  Although this “state-treasury \n                                                 \n12Flint requests that we either certify the question of whether Public Act 436 transforms municipalities into \narms of the state to the Michigan Supreme Court, or delay our opinion “until after Michigan courts have had an \nopportunity to answer it.”  Certification is not appropriate here—Flint did not make the same request to the district \ncourt and we have the appropriate data points to address the issue.  See, e.g., In re Amazon.com, Inc., Fulfillment \nCtr. Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) & Wage & Hour Litig., 852 F.3d 601, 607–08 (6th Cir. 2017).   \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 6 P9a8g4e  :   3P3age 37 of (7357 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 33 \n/1752 /1769 \n \ninquiry will generally be the most important factor, . . . it is not the sole criterion.”  Ernst, \n427 F.3d at 364 (internal quotation marks omitted).  This is so because sovereign immunity \nprotects not only a state’s purse but also its dignity—“it . . . serves to avoid the indignity of \nsubjecting a State to the coercive process of judicial tribunals at the instance of private parties.”  \nSeminole Tribe v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 58 (1996) (citation omitted).  Accordingly, “the last \nthree factors may demonstrate that an entity is an arm of the state entitled to sovereign immunity \ndespite the fact that political subdivisions and not the State are potentially liable for judgments \nagainst the entity.”  Pucci v. Nineteenth Dist. Court, 628 F.3d 752, 762 (6th Cir. 2010).  To do \nso, however, they must “far outweigh” the first factor.  Id. at 761.  Applying this test, we \nconclude the City of Flint has not met its burden to show that it was an “arm of the state” \nprotected by the Eleventh Amendment.13   \n1. \n  Michigan’s  potential  liability  (or  rather,  lack  thereof)  weighs  heavily  against  Flint.  \nMichigan law provides that local property tax rolls account for judgments against cities or its \nofficers, see Mich. Comp. Laws § 600.6093(1), while the state treasury pays judgments against \n“arms of the state.”  See Mich. Comp. Laws §§ 600.6458(2), 600.6096(1).  Public Act 436 does \nnot change this; in fact, it reinforces this dynamic, providing that any claims, demands, or \nlawsuits “arising from an action taken during the services of [an] emergency manager” are to “be \npaid  out  of  the  funds  of  the  local  government  that  is  or  was  subject  to  the  receivership \nadministered by that emergency manager.”  Mich. Comp. Laws § 141.1560(5).  Most critically, \nPublic Act 436 “does not impose any liability or responsibility in law or equity upon th[e] state, \nany department, agency, or other entity of th[e] state, or any officer or employee of th[e] state, or \n                                                 \n13Citing Cash v. Granville County Board of Education, 242 F.3d 219 (4th Cir. 2006), Flint quizzically \nargues it can separately show it is entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity under a “sovereign dignity” inquiry \nindependent from the traditional Ernst factor test set forth in text.  This argument is not well-taken.  For one, we are \nbound by our en banc decision in Ernst, not the Fourth Circuit’s decision in Cash.  For another, Cash does not hold, \nas Flint suggests, that “[e]ven if a defendant fails the Ernst test, it may still enjoy sovereign immunity if the \njudgment would adversely affect the dignity of the State as a sovereign.”  Rather, it holds consistent with our \ncaselaw, that the “state purse” factor is foremost, but in certain situations “sovereign dignity factors”—i.e., Ernst \nfactors two, three, and four—can lead to a finding of sovereign immunity.  Id. at 224; see also Pucci, 628 F.3d at \n761.  Put differently, our Ernst factors already take state dignity into account when evaluating application of the \nEleventh Amendment.   \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 6 P9a8g5e  :   3P4age 38 of (7358 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v.

Comp. Laws § 141.1572.  Michigan’s lack of potential liability here creates \na “strong presumption” against an Eleventh Amendment finding.  See Kreipke, 807 F.3d at 777. \n2. \nAs to the second factor—state law treatment of, and state control over, the entity—we \nstart with a foundational aspect of Michigan law undisputed by the parties:  Municipalities enjoy \nsignificant autonomy over local governmental functions.  “Michigan is strongly committed to the \nconcept  of  home  rule,  and  constitutional  and  statutory  provisions  which  grant  power  to \nmunicipalities are to be liberally construed.”  Bivens v. Grand Rapids, 505 N.W.2d 239, 243 \n(Mich.  1993).    Michigan’s  Constitution  grants  cities  the  “power  to  adopt  resolutions  and \nordinances relating to its municipal concerns, property and government.”  Mich. Const. Art. 7, \n§ 22 (1963).  The Michigan Supreme Court has also held that home rule cities like Flint “enjoy \nnot only those powers specifically granted, but they may also exercise all powers not expressly \ndenied.”  AFSCME v. City of Detroit, 662 N.W.2d 695, 707 (Mich. 2003) (citation and internal \nquotation marks omitted).  Although state statutes and Michigan’s Constitution may limit these \nbroad powers, Michigan’s clear preference is that municipalities have “great[] latitude to conduct \ntheir business.”  Associated Builders & Contractors v. City of Lansing, 880 N.W.2d 765, 769 \n(Mich. 2016).  Flint asks us to find an exception to these general principles because it was \nengaged  in  providing  water  services  to  its  citizens  and  did  so  while  under  the  control  of \nemergency managers.  We decline to do so.   \n  First, citing Curry v. City of Highland Park, 219 N.W. 745 (Mich. 1928), Flint claims \nthat when a municipality acts in the interest of public health, like providing water services, it \n“acts as the arm of the state” under Michigan law.  Id. at 748.  We disagree.  For one, Curry \nnoted that “the management of water works” is a “matter[] of purely local concern . . . as \ndistinguished from the state at large.”  Id. (citation omitted).  But more importantly and as \nrecently illustrated by another Flint Water Crisis case, that is not what Michigan law provides.  \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 6 P9a8g6e  :   3P5age 39 of (7359 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v.

Laws § 117.1, \net seq., is that “if a municipality is supplying a utility, or specifically waterworks, to its citizens \nand the citizens are paying for the same, the municipality is operating the waterworks as a \nbusiness and it is doing so as a businessman or corporation, not as a concern of the state \ngovernment or arm of the state.  It is, after all, serving only a limited number of people within its \nboundaries, not the state as a whole.”  Id. at *4.  Michigan’s Home Rule City Act expressly \nempowers  a  municipality  to  “provide  for  the  installation  and  connection  of  sewers  and \nwaterworks in its charter.”  Id. (citing Mich. Comp. Laws § 117.4b); see also Mich. Comp. Laws \n§§ 117.4c(1), 117.4f.  But if, for example, a municipality supplies water for another purpose—\n“protecting its citizens from fire or natural disaster or anything else that has the potential to have \nstate-wide impact, and it is not profiting from the provision of that water”—then and only then \ncould a municipality’s waterworks “perhaps” serve the state’s citizenry at large and thus be \ndeemed an arm of the state.  Boler, --- N.W.2d ---, 2018 WL 2991257, at *4.  And as the \nMichigan Court of Appeals determined, Flint’s provision of water services clearly falls within its \n“proprietor” function and does not transform the city into an arm of the state.  Id.; see also \nCollins v. City of Flint, 2016 WL 8739164, at *4 (Mich. Ct. Cl. Aug. 25, 2016).   \n  Second, we are equally unconvinced that Flint’s emergency-management status should \nweigh in Flint’s favor.  At first blush, Flint’s argument here has some facial appeal—generally \nspeaking, Public Act 436 can be a one-way ticket to state receivership.  The governor, in \nconsultation with several bodies, determines whether a financial emergency exists, and then \nprovides the entity at issue with four options (one of which is emergency management).  See \nPhillips, 836 F.3d at 712.  Flint claims these options are illusory because state officials still have \nsignificant oversight within each option, and were nonetheless unavailable to Flint because \n                                                 \n14Michigan’s Court of Claims Act grants the Michigan Court of Claims exclusive jurisdiction “[t]o hear \nand determine any claim or demand, statutory or constitutional . . . against the state or any of its departments or \nofficers.”  Mich. Comp. Laws § 600.6419(1)(a).  The issue presented in Boler v. Governor was whether claims \narising out of the Flint Water Crisis against Flint were within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Claims.  \nAlthough it is strictly a statutory interpretation case, we find its analysis persuasive for it provides extensive \ndiscussion about the relationship between Michigan and its political subdivisions.   \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 6 P9a8g7e  :   3P6age 40 of (7450 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 36 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nPublic Act 436 kept in place Flint’s prior-appointed emergency manager under a prior version of \nthe emergency manager law.  See id. at 711–12; see also Mich. Comp. Laws § 141.1549(10).   \nOnce  in  receivership,  the  argument  goes,  Flint  was  essentially  at  the  whim  of  its \nemergency managers.  One need not look beyond Public Act 436’s power-authorizing provision \nto appreciate its breadth:   \nUpon appointment, an emergency manager shall act for and in the place and \nstead of the governing body and the office of chief administrative officer of the \nlocal  government.    The  emergency  manager  shall  have  broad  powers  in \nreceivership  to  rectify  the  financial  emergency  and  to  assure  the  fiscal \naccountability of the local government and the local government’s capacity to \nprovide or cause to be provided necessary governmental services essential to the \npublic  health,  safety,  and  welfare.    Following  appointment  of  an  emergency \nmanager and during the pendency of receivership, the governing body and the \nchief administrative officer of the local government shall not exercise any of the \npowers of those offices except as may be specifically authorized in writing by the \nemergency manager or as otherwise provided by this act and are subject to any \nconditions required by the emergency manager.   \nMich. Comp. Laws § 141.1549(2) (emphasis added).  In essence, an emergency manager acts \n“for and on behalf of the local government,” and may take any “action or exercise any power or \nauthority of any officer, employee, department, board, commission, or other similar entity of the \nlocal  government,  whether  elected  or  appointed,  relating  to  the  operation  of  the  local \ngovernment.”  § 141.1552(dd)–(ee).   \n  There is also a certain amount of control the state has over the emergency manager.  \nAmong other things, an emergency manager “is a creature of the Legislature with only the power \nand authority granted by statute”; is appointed by the governor; serves at the governor’s pleasure, \nand may be removed by the governor or by impeachment by the Legislature; receives financial \ncompensation  from  the  state  treasury;  is  subjected  “to  various  codes  of  conduct  otherwise \napplicable only to public servants, public officers and state officers”; and is statutorily obligated \nto submit certain plans and reports to state officials.  See Mays, 916 N.W.2d at 256 (citations \nomitted).  On this basis, the Michigan Court of Appeals has held (again, in a Flint Water Crisis \nmatter) that an emergency manager is a “state officer” for purposes of the Court of Claims Act \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 6 P9a8g8e  :   3P7age 41 of (7451 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 37 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nand thus “[c]laims against an emergency manager acting in his or her official capacity therefore \nfall within the well-delineated subject-matter jurisdiction of the Court of Claims.”  Id. at 257.   \n  The problem with Flint’s argument is that Michigan courts have rejected the notion that a \ncity’s emergency management status transforms a city into a state entity.  In the words of the \nMichigan Court of Appeals:   \nAs indicated in the Local Financial Stability and Choice Act, “it is a valid public \npurpose for this state to take action and to assist a local government in a financial \nemergency so as to remedy the financial emergency.”  The primary purpose of the \nAct, then, was for the State of Michigan to assist local governments temporarily \nduring a financial crisis.  The emergency manager acts in the place of the chief \nadministrative  officer  and  governing  body  for  and  on  behalf  of  the  local \ngovernment only.  At all times, then, the City remained a municipality, albeit with \na  state  employee  temporarily  overseeing  the  financial  management  of  the \nmunicipality affairs.  The City was at no time operating as “a means or agency \nthrough which a function of another entity i.e., the state is accomplished.”  No \nfunction or purpose of the state was accomplished in the emergency manager \noverseeing the City.  The City was instead always operating as a means through \nwhich functions of its own entity were accomplished.  The state simply engaged a \nstate employee to temporarily  assist the City in performing its functions and \nserving its local purposes for its citizens.   \nBoler v. Governor, --- N.W.2d ---, 2018 WL 2991257, at *6 (alterations and citations omitted); \nsee also Collins, 2016 WL 8739164, at *4–5.  We agree with this well-reasoned analysis.  \nMoreover, it is consistent with our recent decision in Phillips, where we noted Public Act 436 \nmerely reflects states’ abilities “to structure their political subdivisions in innovative ways,” \nincluding by “allocat[ing] the powers of subsidiary bodies among elected and non-elected leaders \nand policymakers.”  836 F.3d at 715.  That is, Public Act “436 does not remove local elected \nofficials; it simply vests the powers of the local government in an emergency manager.”  Id. at \n718.   \n  Given this, we conclude the second factor tilts against Flint.   \n3. \n  The appointment factor weighs in Flint’s favor.  Public Act 436 expressly provides that \nthe governor appoints an emergency manager.  Mich. Comp. Laws § 141.1549(1).  The state \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 6 P9a8g9e  :   3P8age 42 of (7452 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 38 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nattempts  to  temper  this  specific  appointment  language  by  pointing  out  that  emergency \nmanagement under Public Act 436 is one of last resort—that upon declaration of financial \nemergency,  a  municipality  has  several  options  in  addition  to  emergency  management,  see \n§ 141.1547, and may remove an emergency manager after 18 months (or petition the governor to \nremove the emergency manager earlier).  § 1549(6)(c), (11).  That may be so, but Ernst is \nspecific here—we are to consider who appoints the entity at issue, and there is no debating that \nalthough a municipality might have some ability to avoid emergency management or to remove \nan emergency manager, Michigan’s governor appoints emergency managers.   \n4. \n  Whether  the  entity’s  functions  fall  within  the  traditional  purview  of  state  or  local \ngovernment weighs heavily against Flint.  Under Public Act 436, an emergency manager takes \nthe place of a local body; he, in other words, takes over the local government’s functions.  And \nas the State of Michigan rightly phrases it, “[t]he City of Flint’s functions are ‘within the \ntraditional purview of local government’ because the City of Flint is a local government.”   \n  Flint has no answer for this obvious point, and instead asks us to narrowly focus on the \nCity’s provision of waterworks.  It underwhelmingly strings this argument together:  Because \nMichigan’s Safe Drinking Water Act provides the MDEQ with “power and control over public \nwater supplies and suppliers of water” and criminalizes the failure to comply with MDEQ rules, \nsee Mich. Comp. Laws §§ 325.1003, 325.1021, “the functioning of a waterworks falls within the \npurview of the State.”  But even were we to ignore the fact that Public Act 436’s command to an \nemergency manager is to take over all of a municipality’s functions and not just its utilities, the \nanswer is still the same given our discussion above.  Flint even admits as much, telling us “the \nday-to-day operations of a waterworks generally fall within the purview of local authorities.”  \nThat MDEQ “exercises the state’s police powers, in an oversight capacity, by regulating the \nwater quality” does not dictate a contrary conclusion, for “MDEQ does not own, operate or \nmaintain  the  water  delivery  systems, . . .  [n]or  is  it  charged  with  providing  water  to  the \ninhabitants of Michigan’s cities.”  Collins, 2016 WL 8739164, at *4.  Thus, we decline to \neffectively turn every local governmental body’s provision of service into an arm of the state \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 6 P9a9g0e  :   3P9age 43 of (7453 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 39 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nwhen that service is regulated by the state in some fashion.  Cf. N. Ins. Co. of New York v. \nChatham Cty., 547 U.S. 189, 194 (2006) (merely “exercis[ing] a slice of state power” does not \ntransform a state’s subdivision into an arm of the state (internal quotation marks omitted)).   \nB. \n  In sum, Flint has not met its burden to show that when under emergency management, it \nwas an “arm of the state” protected by the Eleventh Amendment.  The foremost consideration—\nthe state’s potential liability for judgment—counsels against a finding of Eleventh Amendment \nimmunity, and the remaining factors do not “far outweigh” this factor.  Pucci, 628 F.3d at 761.   \nVIII. \n  For these reasons, we affirm the district court in part, and reverse in part. \n   \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 6 P9a9g1e  :   4P0age 44 of (7454 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v.

Page 40 \n/1752 /1769 \n \n___________________________________________________________ \nCONCURRING IN PART AND DISSENTING IN PART \n___________________________________________________________ \nMcKEAGUE, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.  The majority tells \na story of intentional poisoning based on a grossly exaggerated version of plaintiffs’ allegations.  \nThe  complaint  tells  an  entirely  different  story.    It  is  a  story  of  a  series  of  discrete  and \ndiscretionary decisions made by a variety of policy and regulatory officials who were acting on \nthe best information available to them at the time.  In retrospect, that information turned out to be \ngrievously wrong.  The result is what has become known as the Flint Water Crisis.  The question \nthis case presents is not whether the collective result of the officials’ actions—the Water Crisis—\ncaused any harm.  It did.  The question is, rather, whether any official’s discrete decisions or \nstatements, which in any way caused or contributed to the Crisis, violated a substantive due \nprocess right to bodily integrity.  By answering that question with, “obviously, yes,” the majority \nextends the protections of substantive due process into new and uncharted territory and holds \ngovernment officials liable for conduct they could not possibly have known was prohibited by \nthe Constitution.  In doing so, the majority unfairly denies defendants protection from suit under \nthe doctrine of qualified immunity.  \nAs in all cases dealing with the defense of qualified immunity, it is plaintiffs’ burden to \nestablish, first, that the defendants violated a constitutional right and, second, that the right was \nclearly established at the time the challenged conduct took place.  Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. \n731, 735 (2011).  I have serious doubts about whether plaintiffs carried their burden at the first \nprong of the analysis.  I am certain they failed to carry their burden at the second.  The majority \nreaches the opposite conclusion by building on a factual narrative of its own invention. \nTo place the qualified-immunity analysis on firmer footing, I begin with a recitation of \nthe allegations as told by plaintiffs in their complaint.  I then turn to qualified immunity’s two \nprongs.  As to the first, I doubt that plaintiffs allege that any defendant deprived them of a \nFourteenth  Amendment  substantive-due-process  right—both  because  the  conduct  actually \nalleged in the complaint does not appear to be conscience-shocking and because the Due Process \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 6 P9a9g2e  :   4P1age 45 of (7455 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 41 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nClause has never before been recognized as protecting against government conduct that in some \nway results in others being exposed to contaminated water.  But even if plaintiffs have alleged \nthe violation of a recognized due process right, their claim nonetheless fails at prong two of the \nqualified-immunity analysis, which asks whether the right was clearly established.  The mere \nfact that no court of controlling authority has ever recognized the type of due process right that \nplaintiffs allege in this case is all we need to conclude the right is not clearly established.  \nAccordingly, qualified immunity must shield each defendant from suit.  \nBefore moving to the analysis, I note several points of agreement with the majority \nopinion.  First, I join the majority in rejecting the City of Flint’s argument that it is entitled to \nEleventh Amendment immunity from plaintiffs’ suit because the State of Michigan’s takeover of \nthe City of Flint, pursuant to Michigan’s “Emergency Manager” law, transformed the City into \nan arm of the state.  Additionally, I agree that plaintiffs fail to state a Fourteenth Amendment \nclaim against Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) employees Nick \nLyon, Eden Wells, Nancy Peeler, and Robert Scott; and Michigan Department of Environmental \nQuality  (MDEQ)  director  Daniel  Wyant.    That  is  where  my  agreement  ends,  however.  \nI respectfully dissent  from  the denial of qualified immunity for  Flint  Emergency Managers \nDarnell Earley and Gerald Ambrose; Flint’s Director of Public Works Howard Croft; and MDEQ \nemployees Liane Shekter-Smith, Stephen Busch, Michael Prysby, and Bradley Wurfel. \nI \nI begin with a review of the facts.  Because this case comes before us on appeal from a \nmotion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, I accept all factual allegations as true and construe \nthem in the light most favorable to plaintiffs.  Linkletter v. W. & S. Fin. Grp., Inc., 851 F.3d 632, \n637 (6th Cir. 2017). \nThe Flint  Water Crisis  began when the City of Flint,  undergoing  extreme financial \ndistress, came under the leadership of a succession of “Emergency Managers”—temporary city \nmanagers appointed by the governor to “act for and in the place and stead of the governing body \nand the office of chief administrative officer of the local government.”  M.C.L. § 141.1549(2).  \nOne of the City’s Emergency Managers was Edward Kurtz.  In 2013, Kurtz made a critical fiscal \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 6 P9a9g3e  :   4P2age 46 of (7456 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 42 \n/1752 /1769 \n \ndecision that set the City on a path toward the Flint Water Crisis.  With the approval of the State \nof Michigan’s treasurer, Kurtz terminated a decades-long contract for water services from the \nDetroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) and ordered Flint to join the newly-formed \nand more affordable Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA).  The KWA was not yet functional, \nhowever.  So Kurtz had to choose an interim source of Flint’s drinking water.  He determined \nthat the best temporary source, from a budgetary standpoint, was the Flint River, treated at the \nCity’s own, and then-idle, water treatment plant.  He notified the DWSD that Flint would soon \ncease receiving water from the DWSD.   \nBefore  the  switch  was  finalized,  Darnell  Earley  took  over  as  Emergency  Manager, \nassuming the position in November 2013.  The City officially switched to the Flint River in April \n2014.  For decades prior, the Flint water treatment plant was designated for emergency use only.  \nA 2011  “feasibility report” concluded that  it  would take extensive upgrades to bring it in \ncompliance with “applicable standards” for use as a permanent water source.  Plaintiffs allege \nthat Earley “rushed” the switch to meet a “self-imposed” and “aggressive” deadline, without \nensuring that Flint’s water treatment plant was ready to properly treat Flint River water, and that \nhe did so for the purpose of cutting costs.  But they also assert that, at some point before the \nApril  2014  switch,  Flint  hired  an  engineering  firm—Lockwood,  Andrews,  &  Newman \n(Lockwood)—“to prepare Flint’s water treatment plant for the treatment of new water sources, \nincluding both the KWA and the Flint River.”  Even though the Flint River water was highly \ncorrosive, plaintiffs allege that Lockwood did not advise the City to set water quality standards \nor implement corrosion control at the water treatment plant prior to using the River as a drinking \nwater source.   \nNeither did the MDEQ—the state agency primarily responsible for ensuring compliance \nwith federal and state safe drinking water laws.  Relevant here, the MDEQ was tasked with \nensuring Flint complied with the federal Lead and Copper Rule.  That Rule generally requires \npublic water systems to monitor and treat lead and copper levels in drinking water.  40 C.F.R § \n141.80, et seq.  The MDEQ believed, erroneously as it turns out, that the Rule allowed Flint’s \nwater treatment plant to begin distributing Flint River water and then conduct two rounds of six-\nmonth testing before determining what method of corrosion control to use to treat the water.  So \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 6 P9a9g4e  :   4P3age 47 of (7457 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 43 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nin  April  2014,  the  City  began  distributing  the  Flint  River  water  to  residents  without  first \nimplementing corrosion control treatment.  Around the time of the switch, the director of Flint’s \nDepartment of Public Works, Howard Croft, publicly announced that the City’s testing proved \nthe water was safe and “of the high quality that Flint customers have come to expect.”   \nSoon after the transition, however, problems emerged.  Residents complained of oddly \nsmelling and discolored water.  In October 2014, General Motors stopped using the City water at \nits engine-manufacturing plant out of fear that high levels of chloride would cause corrosion.  \nThen, after the City attempted to disinfect the water, it discovered trihalomethanes—a potentially \ntoxic byproduct caused by attempting to disinfect the water.  That discovery prompted the City to \nmail a notice to its customers explaining that the City was in violation of the Safe Drinking \nWater Act but that the water was safe to drink for most people with healthy immune systems.  \nAdditionally, plaintiffs say that “[a]s early as January of 2015, the State of Michigan provided \npurified water coolers at its Flint offices in response to concerns about the drinking water.”   \nOn January 9, 2015, the first apparent concerns of lead in Flint’s drinking water began to \nemerge.  On that day, The University of Michigan-Flint discovered lead in campus drinking \nfountains.  It is unclear from the complaint whether that discovery was publicized and thus \nwhether any City or State official involved in testing or distributing Flint’s water knew about the \ndiscovery. \nAlso around January 2015, and largely in response to citizen complaints, Flint hired \nanother engineering firm—Veolia North America, LLC (Veolia)—to review the City’s water \nquality.  Veolia completed a “160-hour assessment of the treatment plant, distribution system, \ncustomer services and communication programs, and capital plans and annual budget.”  The firm \nissued a final report in March, in which it concluded that Flint was in “compliance with State and \nFederal water quality regulations, and based on those standards, the water [was] considered to \nmeet  drinking  water requirements.”  Additionally, it stated that discolorations in  the water \n“raise[d] questions” but that the water remained safe to drink.   \n   \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 6 P9a9g5e  :   4P4age 48 of (7458 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 44 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nAround that time, another Emergency Manger, Gerald Ambrose, took over the City’s \noperations.  On January 12, 2015, the day before Ambrose assumed his Emergency Manager \nrole, the DWSD offered to waive a 4-million-dollar reconnection fee if the City of Flint resumed \nusing its services.  Ambrose declined the offer.  Then, in late March, Flint’s City Council voted \n7-1  to  resume  services  with  the  DWSD.    Ambrose  rejected  the  vote,  calling  it \n“incomprehensible.”   \nIn  the  meantime,  several  MDEQ  employees  were  having  internal  discussions  about \nFlint’s water problems.  Liane Shekter-Smith, MDEQ’s Chief of the Office of Drinking Water \nand Municipal Assistance, emailed other MDEQ employees to suggest that the Flint River water \nwas  “slough[ing]  material  off  of  pipes”  in  the  distribution  system  rather  than  “depositing \nmaterial or coating pipes[.]”  She opined that “[t]his may continue for a while until things \nstabilize.”   \nSoon, an EPA employee became involved in the discussion as well.  Miguel Del Toral, \nthe EPA’s regional drinking water regulations manager, reached out to the MDEQ on February \n27, 2015, to voice his concerns about the possibility of elevated lead levels.  Del Toral informed \nMichael Prysby, an MDEQ engineer, that the MDEQ’s specific method for testing lead levels in \nFlint residents’ tap water may be producing test results that underestimated lead levels.  He also \nasked whether the water treatment plant was using optimized corrosion control, which he noted \nwas “required” to be in place.  That same day, Stephen Busch, an MDEQ District Supervisor in \nLansing,  responded  to  Del  Toral  stating  that  the  water  treatment  plant  had  an  “optimized \ncorrosion control program.”  Two months later, an unidentified individual from the MDEQ \ninformed the EPA that it had no optimized corrosion control treatment in place.   \nIn  April  2015,  Del  Toral  again  reached  out  to  the  MDEQ,  this  time  issuing  a \nmemorandum that expressed concern with the lack of corrosion control and Flint’s water testing \nmethods.  He also told MDEQ employees Busch and Prysby that he believed the MDEQ’s \nsampling procedures did not properly account for the presence of lead service lines.  Therefore, \nDel Toral said he “worried that the whole town may have much higher lead levels than the \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 6 P9a9g6e  :   4P5age 49 of (7459 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 45 \n/1752 /1769 \n \ncompliance results indicated[.]”  According to plaintiffs, the MDEQ “ignored and dismissed” \nDel Toral’s concerns. \nA few months later, plaintiffs say that Busch “claimed that ‘almost all’ homes in the pool \nsampled for lead in Flint had lead services lines,” even though this was untrue.  Plaintiffs do not \nindicate to whom Busch made that statement.  Later in July, a reporter broke a story announcing \nthat Flint’s water was contaminated with lead, citing Del Toral’s April 2015 memorandum.  In \nresponse, Bradley Wurfel, MDEQ’s Communications Director, publicly stated that “anyone who \nis concerned about lead in the drinking water in Flint can relax.” \nThat same month, the EPA and the MDEQ had a conference call to discuss MDEQ’s \ncompliance with the Lead and Copper Rule.  According to plaintiffs, the EPA pushed for Flint to \nuse optimized corrosion control, but the MDEQ insisted that doing so was “unnecessary and \npremature.”  In a follow-up email, MDEQ employee Shekter-Smith asked the EPA to provide a \nwritten concurrence that the City was in compliance with the Lead and Copper Rule. \nAlso in July, MDEQ employees exchanged a series of internal emails discussing how \nwater  tests  performed  by  outside  sources,  which  showed  that  Flint’s  drinking  water  had \nimpermissibly high lead levels, compared with the MDEQ’s own water testing results, which \nshowed lower lead levels.  When a report by a Virginia Tech professor revealing high lead levels \nsurfaced in September 2015, Wurfel made public statements challenging the report and asserting \nthat Flint’s drinking water remained in compliance with federal and state laws.  During this time, \nother MDEQ employees maintained that Flint was not required to use corrosion control until \nunacceptably high levels of lead had already appeared in the water, which they believed was not \nyet the case.  \nLater in September, Croft emailed “numerous officials” to report that the City of Flint \nhad “officially returned to compliance with the Michigan Safe Drinking Water Act” and that it \nhad “received confirming documentation from the [M]DEQ” to that effect.  He explained that \n“[a]t the onset of our plant design, optimization for lead was addressed and discussed with the \nengineering firm and with the [M]DEQ.  It was determined that having more data was advisable \nprior to the commitment of a specific optimization method. . . . We have performed over one \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 6 P9a9g7e  :   4P6age 50 of (7550 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 46 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nhundred and sixty lead tests throughout the city since switching over to the Flint River and \nremain within EPA standards.”1 \nThe MDHHS also began to take a closer look at the outside studies showing high lead \nlevels in Flint’s water.  Though at least a few MDHHS employees became aware of an increase \nin  blood  lead  levels  in  Flint’s  children  in  July,  the  increase  was  attributed  to  “seasonal \nvariation”—a summer phenomenon in which children’s blood lead levels naturally increase \nbecause of more frequent exposure to lead in soil and other seasonal factors.  But in September, \nMDHHS employees began to take a closer look.  They circulated a study conducted  by a \npediatrician at a Flint hospital, Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, which showed elevated blood lead \nlevels in children.  The next day, one MDHHS employee attempted to recreate the study but \ncame up with different numbers.  The City of Flint also issued a health advisory telling residents \nto flush pipes and install filters to prevent lead poisoning.  On October 1, 2015, the MDHHS \nofficially confirmed Dr. Hanna-Attisha’s results.   \nFinally, on October 16, 2015, Flint reconnected to the DWSD.  Two days later, MDEQ \nDirector Daniel Wyant admitted to Michigan’s governor that MDEQ “staff made a mistake while \nworking with the City of Flint.  Simply stated, staff employed a federal (corrosion control) \ntreatment protocol they believed was appropriate, and it was not.”  Several MDEQ employees \nsubsequently resigned or were suspended without pay.  On January 21, 2016, the EPA issued an \nEmergency Order identifying the primary cause of increased lead levels in Flint’s water as being \na lack of corrosion control treatment after the City’s switch to the Flint River. \nII \nTo make it past qualified immunity’s first prong, a plaintiff must plead facts showing that \na government official violated a constitutional right.  al-Kidd, 563 U.S. at 735.  Plaintiffs assert \nthat their claim falls under the fundamental right to bodily integrity, a right guaranteed by the \nsubstantive component of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause.  Albright v. Oliver, \n                                                 \n1It is unclear whether the “one hundred and sixty lead tests” were part of the “160-hour assessment” that \nVeolia conducted in early 2015 as part of its review of the City’s water treatment plant. \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 6 P9a9g8e  :   4P7age 51 of (7551 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 47 \n/1752 /1769 \n \n510 U.S. 266, 272 (1994).  We measure whether the deprivation of a right to bodily integrity—or \nany  other  substantive-due-process  right—actually  occurred  by  determining  whether  a \ndefendant’s alleged conduct was so heinous and arbitrary that it can fairly be said to “shock the \nconscience.”  Lillard v. Shelby Cty. Bd. of Educ., 76 F.3d 716, 725 (6th Cir. 1996).  At times we \nhave treated these two elements (deprivation of a constitutional right and conscience-shocking \nbehavior) as separate methods of stating a substantive-due-process claim.  Range v. Douglas, \n763 F.3d 573, 588 (6th Cir. 2014).  At other times we have concluded they are both required.  \nSee Am. Express Travel Related Servs. Co., Inc. v. Kentucky, 641 F.3d 685, 688 (6th Cir. 2011).  \nBut whether these are two separate methods of establishing a substantive-due-process violation \nor are two required elements of doing so does not change the outcome in this case.  Plaintiffs’ \nallegations show neither conscience-shocking conduct nor the violation of a fundamental right. \nTo  demonstrate  why,  I  turn  back  to  the  allegations  in  plaintiffs’  complaint.    The \ncomplaint is particularly important here, because substantive due process is an undefined area \nwhere “guideposts for responsible decisionmaking . . . are scarce and open-ended” and “judicial \nself-restraint requires us to exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground \nin this field.”  Collins v. City of Harker Heights, 503 U.S. 115, 125 (1992).  We must, therefore, \n“focus  on  the  allegations  in  the  complaint  to  determine  how  [plaintiffs’]  describe[]  the \nconstitutional right at stake and what [defendants] allegedly did to deprive [plaintiffs] of that \nright.”  Id.  The majority pays lip service to that command but abandons it in the analysis.  \nAlthough the majority describes the bodily integrity right at stake as the right to be free from a \ngovernment official “knowingly and intentionally introducing life-threatening substances into \nindividuals without their consent,” the right plaintiffs allege was violated is altogether different.   \nPlaintiffs’ complaint specifically states: “In providing Plaintiffs with contaminated water, \nand/or causing Plaintiffs to consume that water, Defendants violated Plaintiffs’ right to bodily \nintegrity, insofar as Defendants failed to protect Plaintiffs from a foreseeable risk of harm from \nthe exposure to lead contaminated water.”  That claim makes clear where defendants allegedly \nwent wrong.  It was not in knowingly introducing life-threatening substances into plaintiffs’ \nbodies against their will; it was in allegedly “fail[ing] to protect plaintiffs from a foreseeable risk \nof harm from the exposure to lead contaminated water”  (emphasis added). \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 6 P9a9g9e  :   4P8age 52 of (7552 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 48 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nAnd  that  claim,  as  framed  by  plaintiffs,  immediately  encounters  two  roadblocks  to \nestablishing a due process violation: (1) a policymaker’s or regulator’s unwise decisions and \nstatements or failures to protect the public are typically not considered conscience-shocking \nconduct, and (2) the Due Process Clause does not generally guarantee a bodily integrity right \nagainst exposure to contaminated water or other types of environmental harms.  These two \nroadblocks raise serious doubts about whether plaintiffs meet the first prong of the qualified \nimmunity analysis.  I review each of these problems with plaintiffs’ claim in turn, starting first \nwith whether defendants’ alleged conduct rises to the conscience-shocking level. \nA \nThe first roadblock to plaintiffs’ due process claim is that the conduct alleged fails to \nmeet the “high” conscience-shocking standard.  Range, 763 F.3d at 589.  Plaintiffs’ “failure to \nprotect from foreseeable harm” theory sounds in classic negligence.  But negligence—even gross \nnegligence—does not implicate the Due Process Clause’s protections.  Daniels v. Williams, \n474 U.S. 327, 331–33 (1986).  “The Due Process Clause ‘does not purport to supplant traditional \ntort law in laying down rules of conduct to regulate liability for injuries that attend living \ntogether in society[.]’”  Collins, 503 U.S. at 128 (citation omitted).  Rather, it serves to limit the \ngovernment from using its power as an “instrument of oppression.”  DeShaney v. Winnebago \nCty. Dep’t. of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 195 (1989) (citation omitted).  Accordingly, substantive \ndue process is implicated only by government actions (and sometimes failures to act) that are “so \ninspired by malice or sadism rather than a merely careless or unwise excess of zeal that [they] \namount[] to a brutal and inhumane abuse of official power literally shocking to the conscience.”  \nLillard, 76 F.3d at 725 (citation omitted).  Normally, meeting that standard requires plaintiffs to \nshow an intent to injure through some affirmative act, but, depending on the context, even a \ndeliberately indifferent  failure to act may constitute conscience-shocking behavior.  Cty. of \nSacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 846 (1998).  In the context of a non-custodial case such as \nthis one, to show conscience-shocking behavior based on deliberate indifference, a plaintiff must \nshow something akin to “callous disregard or intent to injure.  Schroder v. City of Fort Thomas, \n412 F.3d 724, 730 (6th Cir. 2005) (citing Lewis, 523 U.S. at 846); see also Hunt v. Sycamore \nCmty. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ., 542 F.3d 529, 538 (6th Cir. 2008) (“[I]n order to succeed on a \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 7 P0a0g0e  :   4P9age 53 of (7553 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v.

The \nmajority eschews that requirement.  Instead of reviewing the defendant-specific allegations in \ncontext, it cherry-picks a few “examples” from plaintiffs’ complaint and strings them together to \nform  a  narrative  not  told  by  plaintiffs.    In  compounding  that  error,  the  majority  draws \ninconsistent, even contradictory, conclusions about the level of culpability the allegations entail.  \nIn one breath,  the majority says plaintiffs plausibly  allege that defendants  “knowingly and \nintentionally introduc[ed] life-threatening substances into individuals without their consent.”  \nBut  in  another  breath,  it  says  “[t]here  is  no  allegation  defendants  intended  to  harm  Flint \nresidents.”  In yet another, the majority says defendants “systematically contaminate[d]” the Flint \ncommunity.  I will leave it to the reader to reconcile how conduct may constitute a knowing, \nintentional, and systematic attempt to contaminate another without also being motivated by an \nintent to harm that person.  I, for one, fail to follow that logic.  It is only by this imprecise \nanalysis that the majority concludes these defendants acted in a conscience-shocking manner.   \nA more exact,  defendant-specific analysis shows otherwise.  The following analysis \nreveals that plaintiffs do not allege the additional “callous disregard or intent to injure” element \nthat applies to non-custodial deliberate-indifference claims.  I review the allegations against \nFlint’s Emergency Managers (Darnell Earley  and Gerald  Ambrose),2  Flint’s Department  of \nPublic  Works  Director  (Howard  Croft),  and  the  MDEQ  employees  (Liane  Shekter-Smith, \nStephen Busch, Michael Prysby, and Bradley Wurfel) in turn.  Additionally, I explain why I \nagree with the majority that the case against the MDHHS executives and employees (Nick Lyon, \nEden Wells, Nancy Peeler, and Robert Scott) and the MDEQ Director (Daniel Wyant) must be \ndismissed.  \n                                                 \n2Plaintiffs also bring a claim against the City of Flint, which necessarily rises and falls with their claim \nagainst the Emergency Managers.  Because the Emergency Managers were acting on behalf of the City, their policy \ndecisions concerning the source of the City’s water were also policy decisions of the City.  Accordingly, plaintiffs’ \nclaim implicates the City only to the extent the Emergency Managers’ decisions were unconstitutional.   \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 7 P0a0g1e  :   5P0age 54 of (7554 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 50 \n/1752 /1769 \n \n1 \nFlint  Emergency  Managers  Darnell  Earley  and  Gerald  Ambrose.    First,  consider \nplaintiffs’  allegations  against  Emergency  Managers  Earley  and  Ambrose.    According  to \nplaintiffs,  Earley  “rushed”  the  switch  to  the  Flint  River  to  meet  a  “self-imposed”  and \n“aggressive” deadline as a cost-saving measure without ensuring the water treatment plant was \nadequately equipped to treat the water.  Ambrose later rejected opportunities to return to the \nDWSD despite residents’ complaints and other evidence pointing to the water’s high corrosivity.  \nThe majority concludes that both Emergency Managers approved the initial and ongoing use of \nthe Flint River as a water source despite knowing the City’s water treatment plant was not \nequipped to treat the water.  Not so. \nConsider the Emergency Managers’ decisions in context, starting with the initial switch \nunder Earley’s leadership.  Recall that before the switch, the City consulted with the Lockwood \nengineering firm to ready its treatment plant.  The engineering firm did not advise the City to \nimplement corrosion control.  Neither did the MDEQ.  In fact, the MDEQ informed the City that \nit was “satisfied with the water treatment plant’s ability to treat water from the Flint River.”  And \nalthough the MDEQ noted that the KWA was “a higher quality source [of] water” than the Flint \nRiver,  it  never  indicated  that  use  of  the  Flint  River  would  place  residents  at  risk  of  lead \ncontamination.    Fast-forward  to  early  2015,  when  Ambrose  rejected  two  opportunities  to \nreconnect to the DWSD.  At that time, the City had hired the Veolia engineering firm to review \nits water quality and treatment procedures.  After a 160-hour assessment, Veolia concluded that \nFlint’s water complied with applicable laws and did not advise Flint to use corrosion control.   \nThe Emergency Managers’ reliance on expert advice does not demonstrate a callous \ndisregard for or intent to injure plaintiffs.  Earley and Ambrose were budget specialists, not water \ntreatment experts.  They did not oversee the day-to-day operations of the water treatment plant, \nnor did they carry any responsibility for ensuring its compliance with federal or state laws.  \nAccordingly,  their  reliance  on  the  industry  and  regulatory  experts  who  were  tasked  with \npreparing the water treatment and ensuring its compliance with safe drinking water laws does not \ndemonstrate conscience-shocking behavior. \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 7 P0a0g2e  :   5P1age 55 of (7555 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 51 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nThe majority, with the luxury of hindsight, believes that whether Earley or Ambrose \nreasonably relied on the opinions of the MDEQ or professional engineering firms is better left \nfor summary judgment.  But that belief suggests that the Due Process Clause may obligate \nmanagers of a municipal budget or other government officials to reject the advice of industry and \nregulatory experts based on the risk that those experts are wrong.  Such a conclusion cuts against \nthe  “presumption  that  the  administration  of  government  programs  is  based  on  a  rational \ndecisionmaking process that takes account of competing social, political, and economic forces.”  \nCollins, 503 U.S. at 128.  Indeed, “[i]t is in the very nature of deliberative bodies to choose \nbetween and among competing policy options, and yet a substantive due process violation does \nnot arise whenever the government’s choice prompts a known risk to come to pass.”  Schroder, \n412 F.3d at 729.  Yet under the majority’s conscience-shocking analysis, a whole host of policy \ndecisions  would  now  be  subject  to  constitutional  review,  in  direct  contravention  of  the \npresumption of rational regulatory decisionmaking.  See, e.g., White v. Lemacks, 183 F.3d 1253, \n1258 (11th Cir. 1999) (“[W]hen governmental action or inaction reflects policy decisions about \nresource allocation (as is often the case), those decisions are better made ‘by locally elected \nrepresentatives, rather than by federal judges interpreting the basic charter of Government for the \nentire country.’” (quoting Collins, 503 U.S. at 129)).   \nFinally, the majority asserts that concluding that Ambrose and Earley were relying on \nexperts places an inappropriately “benign construction on the factual allegations.”  Yet the \nmajority  cites  no  factual  allegations  supporting  any  other  conclusion.    Instead,  it  accepts \nplaintiffs’ various “labels and conclusions”—for instance, that Ambrose and Earley “knew” \nabout  risks  to  Flint  residents—as  sufficient  support  for  their  claim.    This  cuts  against  the \nSupreme Court’s directive that plaintiffs allege facts, not conclusions, to state entitlement to \nrelief.  Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007).  The bottom line is that \nplaintiffs do not allege that any industry or regulatory expert informed Earley or Ambrose that \nthe City’s water treatment plant was not equipped to treat Flint River water or that the water was \nnot being treated with corrosion control.  In fact, plaintiffs allege just the opposite.  Professional \nengineering firms and the MDEQ repeatedly affirmed that Flint’s drinking water complied with \napplicable law.  Accordingly, the Emergency Managers’ approval of the plant’s initial and \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 7 P0a0g3e  :   5P2age 56 of (7556 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 52 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nongoing use of the Flint River as a water source does not plausibly demonstrate callous disregard \nfor or an intent to injure plaintiffs, let alone any effort to “systematically contaminate” the Flint \ncommunity. \n2 \nMDEQ employees Liane Shekter-Smith, Stephen Busch, Michael Prysby, and Bradley \nWurfel.  Next consider the claims against the various MDEQ employees.  Plaintiffs contend that \nevery  MDEQ  employee  misinterpreted  the  Lead  and  Copper  Rule.    Under  the  MDEQ’s \nerroneous interpretation of the Rule, the City could begin distributing Flint River water to \nresidents and then conduct two six-month rounds of lead testing before treating the water with \ncorrosion  control.    Without  immediate  treatment,  the  water  accumulated  lead  as  it  flowed \nthrough the City’s pipes.  And over time, plaintiffs’ drinking water became contaminated with \nallegedly unhealthy levels of lead.  Plaintiffs equate the MDEQ’s misinterpretation of the Lead \nand  Copper  Rule’s  corrosion-control  requirements  with  conscience-shocking  behavior  that \ncaused plaintiffs’ exposure to lead. \nAs gravely erroneous as the MDEQ’s interpretation of the Rule appears in hindsight, \nhowever, there is no legal support for the conclusion that it amounted to conscience-shocking \nconduct.  On the contrary, a mistake of law is the classic type of conduct that qualified immunity \nprotects from suit.  Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 231 (2009) (“The protection of qualified \nimmunity applies regardless of whether the government official’s error is ‘a mistake of law, a \nmistake of fact, or a mistake based on mixed questions of law and fact.’” (citation omitted)); \nGavitt v. Born, 835 F.3d 623, 640–41 (6th Cir. 2016).  That should end the case against these \ndefendants. \nThe majority concludes, however, that the MDEQ’s misinterpretation may have been \nintentional.  According to the majority, plaintiffs’ allegations present the “bleak[]” possibility \nthat the MDEQ may have used Flint residents as “guinea pigs” to test lead-compliance theories \nunsupported by the law.  None of plaintiffs’ factual allegations make that inference a reasonable \none.    This  is  not  a  conspiracy  case.    Plaintiffs  do  not  assert  that  the  MDEQ  employees \nmaliciously agreed to a certain incorrect interpretation of the Lead and Copper Rule to exempt \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 7 P0a0g4e  :   5P3age 57 of (7557 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 53 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nFlint from using corrosion control.  And it is implausible that each MDEQ employee individually \nset out to advance the same incorrect interpretation of the Rule just to save the City money.  \nIndeed, plaintiffs do not allege that any MDEQ employee intentionally misled Flint about the \nRule’s requirements.   Instead, plaintiffs’ allege that the MDEQ provided misguided advice \nrooted in mistaken interpretations of law—the type of conduct that, though it led to extremely \nunfortunate consequences here, is classically entitled to protection from suit under the doctrine of \nqualified immunity. \nStill,  the  majority  takes  plaintiffs’  allegations  a  step  further,  making  the  sweeping \nassertion that the MDEQ employees “created” the Flint Water Crisis by knowingly approving \ndistribution of Flint River water with the use of an ill-prepared water treatment plant and then \ndeceiving the public about the consequences of that decision.  The allegations do not support that \ntheory, however. \nFirst, plaintiffs do not allege facts showing that Shekter-Smith, Busch, Prysby, or Wurfel \npersonally approved the City’s use of the Flint River and the Flint water treatment plant.  Rather, \nplaintiffs say that the decision was made by Kurtz, Flint’s 2013 Emergency Manager, with \napproval from the State’s treasurer.  Moreover, plaintiffs fail to allege that any of these MDEQ \nemployees knew that the Flint water treatment plant was incapable of treating Flint River water.  \nTo be sure, plaintiffs allege that “all Defendants” were aware of a 2011 “feasibility report” \nrejecting the use of the Flint River at the time because of costs associated with bringing the \ntreatment plant in compliance with “applicable standards.”  But plaintiffs provide no further \ncontext surrounding the report’s creation and who knew about its contents.  On the other hand, \nplaintiffs allege that, prior to the switch, Flint’s Utilities Administrator told Prysby and Busch \nthat the water treatment plant had “developed a system of redundant electrical systems, treatment \nprocesses  and  adequate  finished  water  storage”  after  consulting  with  the  MDEQ  and  an \nengineering firm.  And after that, Busch informed Wurfel that the MDEQ was “satisfied with the \nCity’s ability to treat water from the Flint River[.]”  These allegations thus do not suggest that \nany MDEQ employee knew the treatment plant was actually incapable of properly treating Flint \nRiver water and approved its use anyway. \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 7 P0a0g5e  :   5P4age 58 of (7558 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 54 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nNor do the majority’s “poignant examples” of a handful of plaintiffs’ allegations show an \nattempt  by  any  MDEQ  employee  to  knowingly  mislead  the  public  about  Flint’s  alleged \nnoncompliance with drinking water laws or to falsely assure residents of the water’s safety.   \nPrysby.  Take Prysby, an MDEQ engineer, first.  The majority latches on to a single \nemail sent from Prysby to a couple other MDEQ employees in October 2014.  In it, Prysby \nopines that the fact that a General Motors engine-manufacturing plant stopped using Flint River \nwater because of its corrosive nature did not mean that the water should be labeled “‘corrosive’ \nfrom a public health standpoint.”  According to the majority, that statement shows that Prysby \nwas more interested in spinning the water’s corrosive nature as unconnected to public health \ninstead of investigating problems with the water.  But a “[n]egligent failure to investigate . . . \ndoes not violate due process.”  Wilson v. Lawrence Cty., 260 F.3d 946, 955 (8th Cir. 2001) \n(citations omitted).  And no other allegation against Prysby demonstrates anything more than a \nfailure to act—plaintiffs’ remaining allegations name Prysby as merely a recipient of various \nemails but they do not identify any specific actions taken by him.  Plaintiffs thus do not plausibly \nallege that Prysby created the Flint Water Crisis and then deceived the public about it.    \nBusch.  Nor do the allegations support such a finding when it comes to Busch.  The \ncomplaint references a number of Busch-authored emails, but the majority references only two \ninternal emails exchanged between MDEQ employees and between Busch and EPA employee \nDel Toral.  The majority concludes that Busch lied in the latter email, when he informed Del \nToral in February 2015 that Flint’s water treatment plant “had an optimized corrosion control \nprogram”  in  place,  which  demonstrates  conscience-shocking  behavior.    But  the  complaint \ncontains no factual allegations supporting the conclusion that Busch’s statement was a lie.  Flint \ndid have a corrosion control “program” in place—a program that permitted a two-round testing \nperiod after the plant became operational and before plant administrators chose a particular \nmethod of corrosion control treatment.  The MDEQ believed the Lead and Copper Rule allowed \nfor that type of program.  Even though the MDEQ was wrong, that error does not support the \nallegation that Busch lied to  the EPA about  the existence of a corrosion  control program.  \nMoreover, plaintiffs do not allege that Busch personally knew that Flint was distributing water \nwithout corrosion control treatment until April 2015.  So even if Busch meant “treatment” when \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 7 P0a0g6e  :   5P5age 59 of (7559 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 55 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nhe said “program” in the February email, the factual allegations do not support the conclusion \nthat he knew the statement was false.  In sum, neither that statement nor the various other \ninternal emails in which Busch expressed support for the MDEQ’s interpretation of the Lead and \nCopper Rule or his belief that the water treatment plant was capable of treating Flint River water \nplausibly demonstrate that Busch created the Flint Water Crisis and then attempted to deceive the \npublic.    \nShekter-Smith.  The allegations likewise fail to demonstrate that Shekter-Smith acted in a \nconscience-shocking manner.  The majority focuses on two of Shekter-Smith’s emails.   \nIn the first, Shekter-Smith requested that an EPA official indicate his agreement “that the \ncity [was] in compliance with the lead and copper rule.”  That, she explained, would help the \nMDEQ “distinguish between [its] goals to address important public health issues separately from \nthe compliance requirements of the actual rule[.]”  The majority’s take on that email is that \nShekter-Smith  cared  more  about  “technical  compliance”  with  the  Lead  and  Copper  than \naddressing an urgent health crisis.  Whatever weight Shekter-Smith actually assigned each of \nthose concerns, all that her email exhibits is an attempt to address them separately.  This is \nhardly conscience-shocking conduct. \nIn the second email, Shekter-Smith responded to a question from Jon Allan, Director of \nthe Michigan Office of the Great Lakes, about the MDEQ’s statewide goals related to health-\nbased standards.  Under those goals, “98 percent of population [sic] served by community water \nsystems” and “90 percent of the non-community water systems” would be providing “drinking \nwater that meets all health-based standards” by 2020.  Allan asked why MDEQ had any goal less \nthan “100 percent,” saying, “How many Flints Do you intend to allow???”  Shekter-Smith \nreplied: \nThe balance here is between what is realistic and what is ideal.  Of course, \neveryone  wants  100  percent  compliance.    The  reality,  however  is  that  it’s \nimpossible.  It’s not that we ‘allow’ a Flint to occur; circumstances happen.  \nWater  mains  break,  systems  lose  pressure,  bacteria  gets  into  the  system, \nregulations change and systems that were in compliance no longer are, etc.  Do \nwe want to put goal [sic] in black and white that cannot be met but sounds good?  \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 7 P0a0g7e  :   5P6age 60 of (7650 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 56 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nOr  do  we  want  to  establish  a  goal  that  challenges  us  but  can  actually  be \naccomplished?  Perhaps there’s a middle ground? \nThis  second  email  likewise  shows  nothing  more  than  Shekter-Smith’s  concern  with \nmeeting agency goals—in this instance, goals related to the statewide administration of safe \ndrinking water.  The propriety of certain agency goals, however, falls outside the purview of the \nDue Process Clause.  Indeed, we presume that agency goal-setting consistent with its regulatory \nduties takes into account “competing social, political, and economic forces” of which judges do \nnot have full view.  Collins, 503 U.S. at 128.  In this instance, Shekter-Smith was apparently \nseeking  to  establish  a  goal  that  could  “actually  be  accomplished.”    That  concern  is  not \nconscience-shocking, regardless of how it sounds in view of what happened in Flint.  These two \nemails,  in  short, do not demonstrate that Shekter-Smith  created the Flint  Water Crisis and \nsubsequently attempted to deceive the public.   \nWurfel.  Of all the MDEQ employees, the majority’s intentional-public-deception theory \nreally implicates only one individual: Wurfel, the Department’s Director of Communications.  \nHe is the only MDEQ employee alleged to have made public statements about Flint’s drinking \nwater.  The majority characterizes Wurfel’s statements as attempts to demean, belittle, and \naggressively dampen challenges to the government’s assertion that Flint’s drinking water was \nsafe.  But however his statements may be characterized, they were not conscience-shocking. \nHis first statement came in July 2015, after a reporter broke a story claiming that there \nwas lead in Flint’s drinking water.  Wurfel publicly responded by saying that “anyone who is \nconcerned about lead in the drinking water in Flint can relax.”  Then, in September 2015, after \ntwo  doctors  released  separate  reports  about  studies  showing  unsafe  levels  of  lead  in  Flint \nresidents’ water, Wurfel placed the blame for the lead on the service lines in residents’ homes \neven though there was, according to plaintiffs, evidence that at least some residents’ service lines \nwere plastic.  Wurfel later called the doctors’ testing results “perplex[ing],” explaining that they \ndid not match the City’s testing results, which he asserted were “done according to state and \nfederal  sampling  guidelines  and  analyzed  by  certified  labs.”    On  two  other  occasions  in \nSeptember, Wurfel asserted the doctors’ studies were inaccurate.   \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 7 P0a0g8e  :   5P7age 61 of (7651 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 57 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nThough plaintiffs assert Wurfel’s statements were knowing lies, their factual allegations \ndo not support that conclusion.  See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555.  As plaintiffs’ complaint alleges, \nWurfel made his public statements after other MDEQ employees represented both that Flint’s \nwater treatment plant was prepared to treat Flint River water and that Flint’s water testing results \nshowed Flint was in compliance with the requirements of the Lead and Copper Rule.  The \nallegations do not show that Wurfel was given contrary information by any City or State official.  \nAccordingly, plaintiffs do not demonstrate that Wurfel intentionally attempted to deceive the \npublic about the safety of Flint’s drinking water or the City’s compliance with drinking water \nlaws.  At most, they show a mistake of law or fact, made at least in partial reliance on the \nrepresentations of other State employees.  It is certainly unfortunate that Wurfel announced those \nmistaken beliefs to the public.  But that he did so does not strip him of the protection of qualified \nimmunity.  Pearson, 555 U.S. at 231.  Wurfel’s handful of statements in July and September do \nnot evince a knowing and intentional attempt to deceive the public about known deficiencies in \nFlint’s water treatment procedures or any conduct designed to intentionally contaminate the \npublic. \nThe allegations against the MDEQ employees, in sum, do not plausibly demonstrate a \ncallous  disregard  for  or  intent  to  injure  plaintiffs,  let  alone  any  effort  to  “systematically \ncontaminate” the Flint community.  What they show instead is a series of internal emails and a \nhandful of public statements regarding the requirements of the Lead and Copper Rule and the \nwater’s safety.  Even if the MDEQ employees made mistakes in interpreting the Rule, those \nmistakes are not conscience-shocking.3 \n                                                 \n3Rather than viewing plaintiffs’ allegations in a light most favorable to defendants, all this conclusion does \nis hold plaintiffs to their burden of presenting factual allegations that provide a plausible basis for their claim.  \nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 555.  Plaintiffs do not provide any factual allegations supporting the conclusion that the \nMDEQ’s interpretations were more than mistakes.  According to the majority, plaintiffs allege that Shekter-Smith, \nBusch, and Prysby knew Flint was not in compliance with applicable law because EPA employee Del Toral made \nthat clear in a memorandum that these defendants “ignored and dismissed.”  But while that memorandum allegedly \nexpressed “concern[]” with Flint’s lack of corrosion control and water testing methods, it did not conclude that Flint \nwas in violation of the Lead and Copper Rule.  Plaintiffs do not allege that Del Toral or any other EPA official \ninformed the MDEQ that Flint was flouting federal drinking water requirements. \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 7 P0a0g9e  :   5P8age 62 of (7652 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 58 \n/1752 /1769 \n \n3 \nFlint  Director  of  Department  of  Public  Works,  Howard  Croft.    Next,  I  turn  to  the \nallegations against Croft, which come nowhere near the high conscience-shocking standard.  \nPlaintiffs assert that Croft “caused and allowed unsafe water to be delivered to Flint’s residents,” \nbut they fail to allege that Croft was actually involved in the City’s decision to use to the Flint \nRiver as a water source or that he played any part in determining whether and when the treatment \nplant  would  use  corrosion  control.    The  majority  finds  that  single,  conclusory  allegation \nsufficient to make the plausible inference that Croft played an affirmative role in approving the \ntransition  to  the  Flint  River.    What  makes  that  conclusion  especially  confounding  is  the \nmajority’s  simultaneous  rejection  of  allegations  against  other  defendants  that  are  just  as \nconclusory as this one.  For example, the majority finds that plaintiffs’ allegation that MDHHS \nexecutive Nick Lyon “participated in, directed, and/or oversaw the department’s efforts to hide \ninformation to save face, and to obstruct and discredit the efforts of outside researchers” as the \nkind of “bare” and “chimerical” assertions Iqbal mandates be set aside.  But the allegation that \nCroft “caused and allowed unsafe water to be delivered to Flint’s residents” is not any more \ndetailed than the “chimerical” assertion against Lyon.  There are only two other allegations \nagainst Croft.  The first is that, at an unidentified point in time, he said in a press release that the \nCity’s water was “of the high quality that Flint customers have come to expect.”  The second is \nthat in September 2015, he emailed “numerous officials” to inform them that the MDEQ had \nconfirmed Flint’s compliance with “EPA standards.”  These allegations do not demonstrate that \nCroft engaged in any behavior that may fairly be construed as conscience-shocking.  \n4 \nMDHHS executives Nick Lyon and Eden Wells; MDHHS employees Nancy Peeler and \nRobert Scott; and MDEQ Director Daniel Wyant.  Finally, a brief word about the MDHHS \nexecutives, the MDHHS employees, and MDEQ Director Wyant, all of whom the majority \ncorrectly dismisses from this case.  I agree with the majority that most of the allegations against \nthe MDHHS executives and employees have to do with negligence (i.e., failing to timely notify \nthe public of the possibility of increased lead in the water) rather than any affirmative action \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 7 P0a1g0e  :   5P9age 63 of (7653 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 59 \n/1752 /1769 \n \ninvolving them in the decision to use the Flint River as a water source without simultaneously \nimplementing  corrosion  control  treatment.    I  agree  as  well  that  once  those  allegations  are \ndiscarded, plaintiffs’ remaining allegations—going to these defendants’ attempts to “discredit” \nstudies from  outside sources—are too  sparse to demonstrate conduct  rising to  the level  of \nconscience-shocking.   \nAnd as to MDEQ Director Wyant, I concur with the majority’s conclusion that none of \nplaintiffs’ allegations show that he was personally involved with the decision to use the Flint \nRiver as a water source or otherwise engaged in any conscience-shocking behavior.   \nAccordingly, I join the majority in concluding that plaintiffs’ allegations against these \ndefendants engaged in conscience-shocking behavior or otherwise infringed on plaintiffs’ due \nprocess rights. \nFor all of these reasons, I do not believe plaintiffs’ allegations suggest that any individual \ndefendant’s actions or failures to act shock the conscience.  This presents a significant roadblock \nthat seems to prevent plaintiffs from establishing a violation of substantive due process and thus \nproceeding past the first prong of the qualified-immunity analysis. \nB \nThe second roadblock to plaintiffs’ substantive-due-process claim—which also suggests \nthey cannot proceed past qualified immunity’s first prong—is that their claim does not appear to \narise from the deprivation of a recognized fundamental right to bodily integrity.  As should be \nclear by now, the right reconstructed by the majority is entirely distinct from the one asserted in \nplaintiffs’  complaint  and  is  thus,  unsurprisingly,  devoid  of  support  from  plaintiffs’  factual \nallegations.   \nSo what is the bodily integrity right plaintiffs allege?  According to the complaint, \ndefendants’ alleged conduct amounted to a failure to protect from exposure to lead-contaminated \nwater.  But although plaintiffs frame the claim that way in their complaint, they insist their claim \ndoes not flow from a right to receive clean water.  Plaintiffs are right to avoid advancing that \ntheory because the Due Process Clause guarantees neither a right to live in a contaminant-free \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 7 P0a1g1e  :   6P0age 64 of (7654 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 60 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nenvironment, Collins, 503 U.S. at 125–26, nor a fundamental right to water service.  In re City of \nDetroit, 841 F.3d 684, 700 (6th Cir. 2016) (quoting Golden v. City of Columbus, 404 F.3d 950, \n960 (6th Cir. 2005)).  Still, it is hard to understand plaintiffs’ claim independent from the right to \nreceive clean water.  If the Constitution does not guarantee the right to receive clean water on the \none hand, how may it guarantee the right not to be exposed to contaminated water on the other? \nThe majority avoids grappling with that issue by turning, inappropriately, to abstract \nconcepts of personal autonomy and informed consent that it divines from several inapposite \ncases.  In  so  doing,  the  majority’s  analysis  runs  contrary  to  the  “restrained  methodology” \noutlined by the Supreme Court in Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 721 (1997).  To \napply that methodology, we look to “concrete examples involving fundamental rights found to be \ndeeply rooted in our legal tradition.”  Id. at 722.  Those examples reveal the “outlines of the \n‘liberty’ [interests] specially protected by the Fourteenth Amendment[.]”  Id.  Because the Due \nProcess Clause’s substantive component protects only those rights that are an integral part of our \n“Nation’s history and tradition,” courts “have always been reluctant to expand” the Clause’s \ncoverage into new territory.  Id. at 720–21.  Looking to concrete examples regarding what those \nhistoric rights are “tends to rein in the subjective elements that are necessarily present in due-\nprocess judicial review.”  Id. at 720, 722.   \nIn Glucksberg, the Court showed us how to use that “restrained methodology.”  There, \nthe Supreme Court dismissed a claim by state physicians that the Due Process Clause guaranteed \na right to physician-assisted suicide.  Id. at 721–24.  The physicians argued that recognizing such \na right would be consistent with the “self-sovereignty” principles underlying a person’s interest \nin choosing between life and death, which were articulated in Cruzan v. Missouri Department of \nHealth, 497 U.S. 261 (1990).  Id. at 723–24.  In rejecting that argument, the Glucksberg Court \nclarified that Cruzan assumed, though did not definitively decide, that a competent person had a \nright to refuse unwanted lifesaving medical treatment.  Id. at 720.  That assumption, however, \n“was not simply deduced from abstract concepts of personal autonomy.”  Id. at 725.  It instead \narose from the “common-law rule that forced medication was a battery, and the long legal \ntradition protecting the decision to refuse unwanted medical treatment[.]”  Id.  The specific right \nto  physician-assisted  suicide  found  no  support  in  the  examples  outlined  in  the  Court’s \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 7 P0a1g2e  :   6P1age 65 of (7655 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 61 \n/1752 /1769 \n \njurisprudence  or  in  our  Nation’s  history  or  traditions  and  was  therefore  not  protected  by \nsubstantive due process.  Id. at 723–24.   \nLikewise,  no  concrete  examples  arising  from  the  established  bodily  integrity \njurisprudence  or  from  our  Nation’s  history  or  traditions  support  the  right  asserted  here—\nprotection from policy or regulatory decisions or public statements that, somewhere down the \nline, result in exposure to contaminated water.   \nWe have previously interpreted the bodily integrity right as “the right against forcible \nphysical intrusions of the body by the government.”  Planned Parenthood Sw. Ohio Region v. \nDeWine, 696 F.3d 490, 506 (6th Cir. 2012) (citations omitted).  The right is outlined most \nexplicitly in Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165 (1952).  There, the Court held that the Due \nProcess Clause prohibits a state from securing evidence in support of a conviction by using a \nvomit-inducing solution to forcibly extract the evidence from a suspect’s stomach.  Id. at 172–\n74.  That intrusion on an individual’s body, the Court explained, was “too close to the rack and \nthe screw” to be constitutionally permissible.  Id. at 172.  Since then, the Court has concluded \nthat similar types of physically intrusive law enforcement searches implicate the right to bodily \nintegrity.  Those include a “compelled physical intrusion beneath [a suspect’s] skin and into [the] \nveins  to  obtain  a”  blood  sample,  Missouri  v.  McNeely,  569  U.S.  141,  148  (2013),  and  a \nnonconsensual surgery to retrieve a bullet from a suspect’s chest.  Winston v. Lee, 470 U.S. 753, \n767 (1985).  In this Circuit, we have concluded that obtaining evidence by “anally prob[ing]” an \nindividual “without his consent” when he was “naked and handcuffed, . . . paralyzed, [and] \nintubated” was such a grave bodily integrity violation that it rendered the Fourth Amendment \nsearch unreasonable.  United States v. Booker, 728 F.3d 535, 537, 547 (6th Cir. 2013) (citation \nomitted).   \nIn the medical context, too, the Court has underscored the right’s guarantee against direct, \nphysical  intrusions  into  an  individual’s  body  at  the  hands  of  a  government  official.    In \nWashington  v.  Harper,  for  instance,  the  Court  emphasized  the  significance  of  an  inmate’s \n“liberty interest in avoiding the unwanted administration of antipsychotic drugs.”  494 U.S. 210, \n221, 223 (1990).  Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 135 (1992) affirmed the magnitude of that \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 7 P0a1g3e  :   6P2age 66 of (7656 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 62 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nliberty interest—avoiding the unwanted administration of drugs—for pretrial detainees as well.  \nLater, in Cruzan, the Court explained that the general principles underlying Harper and Riggins \nsuggested that “a competent person [has] a constitutionally protected right to refuse lifesaving \nhydration and nutrition.”  497 U.S. at 280; Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 720 (explaining that Cruzan \n“assumed, and strongly suggested, that the Due Process Clause protects” such a right without \nexpressly concluding that it did (citing Cruzan, 497 U.S. at 278–79)).  In the same vein, cases \nfrom the Supreme Court and our Circuit suggest that the right to bodily integrity is implicated by \ngovernment interference with a woman’s right to obtain an abortion.  See id. at 726–27; Planned \nParenthood Sw. Ohio Region, 696 F.3d at 507. \nThese cases delineate the contours of the right to bodily integrity in terms of intrusive \nsearches or forced medication.  None of them is compatible with the “careful description” of the \nright at issue here: protection from exposure to lead-contaminated water allegedly caused by \npolicy or regulatory decisions or statements.4  Even the few district court or sister circuit cases \ncited by the majority do not clarify the contours of plaintiffs’ alleged right.  All except one of \nthose  cases  deal  with  medical  professionals  performing  government-sponsored  invasive \nprocedures or harmful experiments on unsuspecting patients.5  The last one deals with police \n                                                 \n4Even In re Cincinnati Radiation Litigation, 874 F. Supp. 796 (S.D. Ohio 1995), the one district court case \nthe majority finds “especially analogous,” fails to close the gap.  There, the court concluded that government \nofficials violated medical patients’ right to bodily integrity by devising a program that subjected unwitting cancer \npatients to high doses of radiation under the guise of performing cancer treatment.  Id. at 803–04.  But whether the \nDue Process Clause protects hospital patients from being intentionally subjected to harmful medical treatment \nwithout their consent is not the determinative issue here.  What we should care about is whether and when it protects \nan indeterminate number of public citizens from certain regulatory decisions or statements that have some impact on \nthe quality of public drinking water or any other environmental resource.   \n5Barrett v.

But they say \nnothing  about  how  non-custodial  policy  or  regulatory  decisions  or  statements  affecting  the \nquality of an environmental resource may do so.  In short, neither our Nation’s history and \ntraditions nor governing bodily integrity jurisprudence suggests that the conduct alleged here is \ncomparable  to  a  “forcible  physical  intrusion[]  of  the  body  by  the  government.”    Planned \nParenthood Sw. Ohio Region, 696 F.3d at 506.  “The mere novelty of such a claim is reason \nenough to doubt that ‘substantive due process’ sustains it.”  Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 303 \n(1993).   \nIn sum, because the conduct alleged does not appear to rise to the level of conscience-\nshocking,  and  because  I  believe  it  does  not  demonstrate  the  deprivation  of  a  recognized \nfundamental right, I have serious doubts about whether plaintiffs state a substantive due process \nclaim sufficient to carry them past prong one of the qualified-immunity analysis.   \nIII \nThe  second  prong  of  the  qualified-immunity  analysis  looks  to  whether  the  alleged \nconstitutional right was “clearly established” at the time the government official acted.  al-Kidd, \n563 U.S. at 735.  This presents the most fundamental problem for plaintiffs’ case.  To the extent \nplaintiffs do successfully allege the violation of a constitutional right, the novelty of that right \njust shows that it was not clearly established at the time the alleged events unfolded.  Therefore, \nthe doctrine of qualified immunity shields every defendant from suit. \nFor a right to be clearly established, its contours must be “sufficiently clear that every \nreasonable official would have understood that what he is doing violates that right[.]”  Mullenix \nv.

Plaintiffs must be able to “identify a case with a similar fact \npattern” to this one “that would have given ‘fair and clear warning to officers’ about what the \nlaw requires.”  Arrington-Bey v. City of Bedford Heights, 858 F.3d 988, 993 (6th Cir. 2017) \n(quoting White v. Pauly, 137 S. Ct. 548, 552 (2017)).  Identifying a factually similar case is \nespecially important in the realm of substantive due process, where the inherent ambiguity of \nwhat the law protects is best discerned through “carefully refined . . . concrete examples[.]”  \nGlucksberg, 521 U.S. at 722. \nHere,  that  means  plaintiffs  must  be  able  to  point  to  controlling  cases  extending \nsubstantive due process protections to the following individuals: \n•  A high-level government executive who makes a decision (or proceeds with a \nproject) while relying on expert opinions that the decision or project is lawful and \nsafe (Earley and Ambrose). \n•  A regulator who misinterprets environmental laws and provides bad advice to \ngovernment policymakers (MDEQ employees). \n•  A city or state regulator who, based on the erroneous advice of other regulators, \npublicly announces that a government-provided resource is safe for consumption \nwhen it is not (Wurfel, Croft, or others who made public statements). \nAs the majority acknowledges, plaintiffs point to no factually similar controlling case in which a \ncourt found that such conduct violated a constitutional right to bodily integrity.  “This alone \nshould have been an important indication to the majority that [the defendants’] conduct did not \nviolate [plaintiffs’] ‘clearly established’ right.”  White, 137 S. Ct. at 552.   \nIn  fact,  in  case  after  case  around  the  country,  courts  have  consistently  rejected \nsubstantive-due-process claims based on the type of conduct alleged here.  Branch v. Christie is \none such case.  2018 WL 337751 (D.N.J. Jan. 8, 2018).  Branch dealt with a bodily integrity \nclaim brought by parents of New Jersey public school children against several state officials for \n“knowingly expos[ing] the children . . . to water that was contaminated with unsafe levels of \nlead,” and “concoct[ing] a scheme to cover up the health hazard.”  Id. at *1.  The parents said \nthat state employees caused the lead contamination by “cancel[ling] work orders to change \noutdated and lead-saturated filters,” and “allowing several filters to be used for upwards of five \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 7 P0a1g6e  :   6P5age 69 of (7659 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 65 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nyears.”  Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Once the public became aware of the \nunsafe lead levels in the school’s drinking fountains, state employees “undertook a course of \nproviding  misinformation  to  parents,  telling  the  community  that  the  water  was  safe.”    Id. \n(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  The Branch court dismissed the parents’ \nclaims, finding “no authority” supporting their bodily integrity theory.  Id. at *8.  As the court \nexplained, “[t]he liberty interest in bodily integrity guarantees the ‘right  generally to resist \nenforced medication,’ the right to be ‘free from medical invasion,’ and the right to an abortion,” \nbut “not to guarantee . . . a right to minimum levels of safety” or protection from contaminated \nwater.  Id. at *7 (citations omitted). \nHere, as in Branch, government officials allegedly exposed others to water contaminated \nwith lead.  And here, as in Branch, certain government officials allegedly attempted to hide the \nlead contamination.  The Branch court could find no authority indicating that such conduct \nviolated a substantive due process right—not even the Supreme Court’s bodily integrity cases \nwere close to on point.  That court’s conclusion shows how unclear it would have been for the \nregulators and policymakers in this case to have anticipated that their actions might have violated \nan established bodily integrity right.   \nCoshow v. City of Escondido, a state court case, also sheds light on the novelty of \nplaintiffs’ asserted right.  132 Cal. App. 4th 687 (Cal. Ct. App. 2005).  There, the California \nCourt of Appeals rejected residents’ bodily integrity claims against the City of Escondido and \nCalifornia’s Department of Health Services over their decision to add fluoride to public drinking \nwater.  Id. at 698.  The residents asserted that adding fluoride to the water exposed the public to \nunnecessary health risks.  Id.  But the court held that, just as the Constitution did not guarantee \nany “right to a healthful or contaminate-free environment,” it likewise did not guarantee a right \nto receive fluoride-free drinking water from the City.  Id. at 709–10.  This was so even though \nthe fluoride might have contained “trace levels of lead and arsenic[.]”  Id. at 700.  The court \nreasoned that the residents’ claim came down to an asserted right to receive “public drinking \nwater of a certain quality.”  Id. at 708–09.  And it held that the “mere novelty” of that claim \nindicated it was not “so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as \nfundamental.”  Id. (quoting United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 751 (1987)).  Accordingly, \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 7 P0a1g7e  :   6P6age 70 of (7750 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 66 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nthe court held that the right to fluoride-free drinking water was not protected by substantive due \nprocess.  Id.  \nJust as in Coshow, the novelty of plaintiffs’ claim here shows that it is not clearly \nestablished.  The majority attempts to draw a disingenuous distinction between this case and \nCoshow.  It reasons that, in Coshow, adding fluoride to drinking water served the beneficial \npurpose  of  preventing  tooth  decay  while,  in  this  case,  adding  lead  to  water  served  no \ncountervailing governmental interest.  I certainly do not quibble with the premise that adding \nlead to water furthers no discernable beneficial purpose.  But that is not what happened here.  No \ngovernment official made a conscious decision to introduce lead into Flint’s water.  Instead, the \nEmergency Managers made a conscious and legitimate policy decision to switch to the Flint \nRiver as a water source to cut costs—and they did so in reliance on guidance from engineering \nfirms and the MDEQ.  That hardly demonstrates that the decision to switch to the Flint River was \nmade with no countervailing governmental interest in mind.  The government officials’ resource-\nallocation decisions during a budgetary crisis did not constitute obvious violations of the right to \nbodily integrity because of the grave health consequences they allegedly caused in hindsight. \nMoreover, that some governmental officials made public statements about the safety of \nFlint’s water does not make the unlawfulness of any defendant’s conduct any more obvious.  As \nthe Second Circuit put it, “no court has ever held a government official liable for denying \nsubstantive due process by issuing press releases or making public statements”—regardless of \nwhether the public statements were true or false.  Benzman v. Whitman, 523 F.3d 119, 125, 127 \n(2d Cir. 2008) (rejecting residents’ substantive due process claims against EPA officials for \nmaking “substantially  exaggerated” statements  regarding  air quality after the September 11 \nterrorist attacks).  Benzman invoked the principles underlying a similar post-September-11 case, \nLombardi v. Whitman, 485 F.3d 73 (2d Cir. 2007).  In Lombardi, workers who performed search, \nrescue, and clean-up services at the World Trade Center site in the aftermath of the terrorist \nattacks alleged that the EPA violated their right to bodily integrity by falsely assuring them that it \nwould be safe to work without respiratory protection.  Id. at 74.  Relying on those assurances, \nseveral workers went without that protection and later suffered adverse health effects.  Id. at 75.  \nWithout definitively deciding whether the alleged false assurances interfered with the workers’ \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 7 P0a1g8e  :   6P7age 71 of (7751 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 67 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nfundamental right to bodily integrity, the court found that they were nevertheless not conscience-\nshocking.  Id. at 82–83.  In so deciding, the court expressed concern with imposing broad \nconstitutional liability on EPA officials for making false statements in the course of fulfilling the \nagency’s mission.  The court reasoned that “the risk of such liability will tend to inhibit EPA \nofficials in making difficult decisions about how to disseminate information to the public in an \nenvironmental emergency.”  Id. at 84.  Accordingly, absent any allegation of an intent to harm, \nthe court declined to extend substantive due process to cover what was “in essence a mass tort \nfor making inaccurate statements.”  Benzman, 523 F.3d at 127–28. \nThis case implicates similar, albeit not identical, concerns to those invoked in Lombardi \nand Benzman.  As the majority points out, there is no allegation that any defendant here intended \nto harm a Flint resident.  And like the EPA regulators in Lombardi and Benzman, Wurfel made \npublic statements pursuant to his official role as MDEQ’s Director of Communications.  To be \nsure,  those  statements  countered  evidence  about  Flint  water’s  lead  levels  presented  in  two \nseparate outside studies.  But they were also consistent with information provided to Wurfel by \nofficials from his own department.  That information was, in retrospect, misguided.  Plaintiffs do \nnot  assert,  however,  that  Wurfel  made  any  knowingly  false  statements  for  the  purpose  of  \ncausing harm.  The same goes for Croft.  When he issued a press release asserting that Flint’s \nwater was of a “high quality,” at least one engineering firm and the MDEQ had concluded that \nthe water treatment plant was capable of adequately treating Flint’s water.  In other words, the \nallegations do not show that Croft made a knowingly false public statement for the purpose of \ncausing  harm.    Given  the  absence  of  any  such  allegation,  and  because  no  court  has  ever \nconcluded that the Due Process Clause covers the public statements of government officials, it \ncan hardly have been apparent to Wurfel or Croft that their statements clearly violated plaintiffs’ \ndue process right to bodily integrity. \nDue to the lack of controlling precedent and the many cases suggesting substantive due \nprocess does not protect plaintiffs’ asserted right, the majority again falls back on its exaggerated \ncharacterization  of  defendant’s  actions  and  statements,  likening  them  to  the  “systematic” \npoisoning of an entire community.  Advancing that narrative, the majority concludes that this \ncase is one of the “easy” ones that should never have arisen in the first place.  See United States \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 7 P0a1g9e  :   6P8age 72 of (7752 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 68 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nv. Lanier, 520 U.S. 259, 271 (1997).  “Of course, in an obvious case, [general] standards,” (or \nreasoning) “can ‘clearly establish’ the answer, even without a body of relevant  case law.”  \nBrosseau v. Haugen, 543 U.S. 194, 199 (2004) (citation omitted).  But this is not one of those \ncases.  As already demonstrated, the majority’s systematic poisoning narrative has no basis in \nplaintiffs’ factual allegations.7  This is not a case about a government official knowingly and \nintentionally  introducing  a  known  contaminant  into  another’s  body  without  that  person’s \nconsent.  It is a case about a series of erroneous and unfortunate policy and regulatory decisions \nand statements that, taken together, allegedly caused plaintiffs to be exposed to contaminated \nwater.  \nThe proper framing of the factual narrative exposes how far off base are the bodily \nintegrity cases relied upon by the majority.  How could those cases have provided any practical \nguidance to government officials like Earley, Ambrose, Croft, or the MDEQ employees?  For \ninstance, how should Rochin’s prohibition against induced vomiting to obtain evidence have \ninformed  Earley’s  oversight  of  the  switch  from  the  DWSD  to  the  Flint  River  and  what \nprofessional opinions he was entitled to rely upon when the City made the switch?  And how \nshould it have informed Ambrose’s decision to continue using the Flint River as a water source \nand what professional opinions he was entitled to rely upon in doing so?  What about the MDEQ \nemployees?  How should Riggins’s limits on the state’s ability to administer antipsychotic drugs \nto pretrial detainees have changed what kind of advice the MDEQ employees gave the City \nabout federal corrosion-control requirements?  Or what about the fact that Cruzan allows a state \n                                                 \n7What is more, the majority’s exaggerated narrative runs contrary to what is publicly known in  the \naftermath of the Flint Water Crisis.  For instance, plaintiffs point out that the state has brought criminal charges \nagainst various defendants and ask us to take judicial notice of those charges as providing context for their bodily \nintegrity claim.  Of course, I agree with the majority that it is inappropriate to consider those charges for the purpose \nof deciding plaintiffs’ constitutional claim.  But I note that even if it were appropriate to consider them, the charges \nwould not support plaintiffs’ assertion that defendants’ conduct is so obviously unlawful that qualified immunity \ndoes not shield them from plaintiffs § 1983 suit.  In fact, they prove just the opposite.  If the defendants’ actions are \nobviously unlawful, then one would expect relatively speedy probable-cause determinations.  Reality suggests \notherwise.  Consider this: the state issued its complaint against Lyon on June 14, 2017, but the court did not find \nprobable cause to bind him over for trial until August 24, 2018.  In the meantime, the trial judge spent around \n11 months on preliminary examinations just to find probable cause existed.  Other defendants, such as MDEQ \nEmployee Shekter-Smith and MDHHS Executive Peeler, have not even been bound over yet, despite the state filing \ncomplaints against them as early as July 2016.  These cases have languished unusually long in probable cause \nproceedings.  That alone suggests that the egregiousness of defendants’ actions is not so apparent as the majority \nmakes it out to be. \n\nCase 5:16-c v  -  1 C24a1s2e-:J 1E7L--1M69K8M        EDCoFcu Nmoe. n2t4: 06 4  -f2il e  d   F0i1le/0d4: /0119/ 0  4 P/2a0g1e9ID   . 7 P0a2g0e  :   6P9age 73 of (7753 of 75)\nNos. 17-1698 /1699 /1745  Guertin, et al. v. State of Mich., et al.  Page 69 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nto demand clear and convincing evidence that an incompetent patient no longer desires life \nsupport before cutting it off?  How should that have influenced the content of Wurfel’s (or any \nother defendant’s) public statements about the water’s quality?  The answer to these questions \nis—clearly—not established. \nAnd although the right plaintiffs allege is not established, various courts have certainly \nconsidered it—and rejected it.  See Branch, 2018 WL 337751; Coshow, 132 Cal. App. 4th 687; \nBenzman, 523 F.3d 119; Lombardi, 485 F.3d 73.8  But ignoring those cases, the majority turns, \ncuriously, to a few federal and state cases arising from the Flint Water Crisis itself.  The majority \nbegins its opinion with the proclamation that it joins a few decisions concluding that some of \nthese same defendants, and some others, violated various Flint residents’ substantive due process \nrights.  Those cases offer weak support for the majority’s position.  Oddly, one of the decisions it \ncites is the very case before us on appeal, Guertin v. Michigan, 2017 WL 2418007 (E.D. Mich. \nJune 4, 2017).  The second is authored by the same judge as authored Guertin, and its bodily \nintegrity analysis block-quotes more than 2,000 words from the Guertin analysis.  In re Flint \nWater Cases, 329 F. Supp. 3d 369, 397–400 (E.D. Mich. 2018), vacated on other grounds (Nov. \n9, 2018).  And that case appears to follow the same analytical errors as the state case to come \nbefore it—that is, just like the state case, it makes several logical leaps to conclude that policy \nand  regulatory  decisions  and  statements  are  on  par  with  an  intentional  introduction  of  a \ncontaminant into another’s body.  Mays v. Snyder, 916 N.W.2d 227 (Mich. Ct. App. 2018); Mays \nv. Snyder, No. 16-000017-MM  (Mich. Ct.  Cl. Oct.  26, 2016).

Page 70 \n/1752 /1769 \n \nredundant  analyses  provide  a  weak  foundation  on  which  to  build  a  new  bodily  integrity \njurisprudence. \nIn sum, the majority’s opinion is a broad expansion of substantive due process, which \ncontradicts the traditional understanding that due process does not “supplant traditional tort law” \nor impose a duty on the government to ensure environmental safety.  Collins, 503 U.S. at 126 \n(citation omitted).  What is more, it effectively “convert[s] the rule of qualified immunity . . . \ninto a rule of virtually unqualified liability” for government officials making policy or regulatory \ndecisions or statements that have any effect on a publicly consumed environmental resource.  \nWhite, 137 S. Ct. at 552 (ellipses in original) (citation omitted).  That turns qualified immunity \non its head. \nIV \nThe majority’s conclusion that the defendants violated plaintiffs’ clearly established right \nto bodily integrity has some facial appeal, of course, because we sympathize with the Flint \nresidents’ plight.  It is wrong, however, on both the facts and the law.  For all of the above \nreasons, I join the majority in its denial of sovereign immunity to the City of Flint and in \ndismissing various defendants from the case.  But I dissent from its denial of qualified immunity \nto Earley, Ambrose, Croft, Shekter-Smith, Busch, Prysby, and Wurfel. \n\nCase 5:16-cv  -  1  2C4a1s2e-J: E17L--1M6K9M8       E DCoFc uNmo.e 2n4t:0 6  4 f-i3le  d    0F1il/e0d4:/ 1091 / 0  4P/a2g0e1I9D  . 7  0P2a2g e  :  P1age 75 of (7755 of 75)\nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT \n \nNos. 17-1698/1699/1745/1752/1769 \n \n \nSHARI GUERTIN, individually and as next friend \nof her child, E.B., a minor; DIOGENES MUSE-CLEVELAND, \n  Plaintiffs - Appellees, \n \n  v. \n \nSTATE OF MICHIGAN, et al., \n  Defendants, \n \nCITY OF FLINT, MICHIGAN, HOWARD CROFT, \nDARNELL EARLEY, and GERALD AMBROSE (17-1699); \nLIANE SHEKTER-SMITH, DANIEL WYANT, STEPHEN \nBUSCH, MICHAEL PRYSBY, and BRADLEY WURFEL (17-1745); \nNANCY PEELER (17-1752); ROBERT SCOTT (17-1769); \nEDEN WELLS and NICK LYON (17-1698), \n  Defendants - Appellees. \n \n \n \nBefore:  McKEAGUE, GRIFFIN, and WHITE, Circuit Judges. \n \nJUDGMENT\n \n \nOn Appeal from the United States District Court \nfor the Eastern District of Michigan at Ann Arbor. \n \n  THIS CAUSE was heard on the record from the district court and was argued by counsel. \n \n  IN CONSIDERATION THEREOF, it is ORDERED that the judgment of the district court is \nAFFIRMED IN PART and REVERSED IN PART. \n \n            ENTERED BY ORDER OF THE COURT \n \n \n \n \n \n            Deborah S.

Shari Guertin, individually \nand  as  next  friend  of  her  minor  child,  E.  B.,  and  Diogenes  Muse-\nCleveland bring suit against a number of individuals and private, local, \nand state entities.  The individual defendants who were or are employed \nby defendant Michigan Department of Environmental Quality filed the \nmotion for change of venue at issue here, arguing that the relevant jury \npool  has  been  tainted  by  local  news  coverage  of  the  Flint  water \nsituation, and thus venue must be changed to protect defendants’ right \nto a fair trial by an impartial jury.  These defendants and those that \nlater joined in the motion rely on a report prepared by Bryan Edelman, \nPh.D., which included a media analysis of the local news coverage and \nsummarized the results of a telephone interview of 373 individuals from \nthe  local  jury  pool.    Although  much  of  Dr.  Edelman’s  report  is \ncompelling,  the  motion  is  denied  without  prejudice  because  it  is \npremature. \nI.  Background \nPlaintiffs Shari Guertin, E. B., and Diogenes Muse-Cleveland are \nall residents of Flint, Michigan.  (Dkt. 1 at 2.)  Plaintiffs allege that \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   ECF No. 113   filed 01/23/17    PageID.4419    Page 3 of 18\ntesting  revealed  elevated  levels  of  lead  in  their  tap  water,  which \ndefendants were aware of as early as 2014.  (Id.)  According to plaintiffs, \ndefendants failed to “take any measures to eliminate this danger, as \nrequired  by  federal  law,  but  they  actually  took  affirmative  steps  to \ndownplay  the  severity  of  the  contamination  from  its  citizens.”    (Id.)  \nPlaintiffs  argue  that  this  was  negligent  and  reckless,  and  exposed \nplaintiffs to “devastating and irreversible health problems.”  (Id.)  They \nbring  substantive  and  procedural  due  process  claims  under  the \nConstitution  and  a  number  of  state  law  claims,  seeking  “damages \nagainst those [d]efendants named in their individual capacities . . . and \nagainst the City of Flint,” and “prospective relief only as against the \nState of Michigan, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, \nand the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.”  (Id. at \n3.) \nIndividual  defendants  Stephen  Busch,  Patrick  Cook,  Michael \nPrysby,  Liane  Sheckter-Smith,  Bradley  Wurfel,  and  Daniel  Wyant, \ncurrent  and  former  employees  of  the  Michigan  Department  of \nEnvironmental Quality (the “MDEQ Employee Defendants”), filed the \nmotion for change of venue at issue here.  (Dkt. 45.)  Defendants Veolia \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   ECF No. 113   filed 01/23/17    PageID.4420    Page 4 of 18\nNorth  America,  LLC;  Lockwood,  Andrews  and  Newnam,  Inc.;  and \nRobert Scott concur in the motion.  (Dkts. 60, 107, 111.)  Defendants \nNick Lyon, Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, Michigan \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, State of Michigan, Richard \nSnyder, and Eden Wells (the “State Defendants”) neither oppose nor \nconcur in the motion, but suggest that they will be prejudiced if the case \nis transferred to another venue before the Court resolves the pending \nmotions to dismiss.  (Dkt. 62.)  Plaintiffs and defendant City of Flint \noppose the motion.  (Dkts. 64, 94.)1 \nThe following is drawn from Dr. Edelman’s affidavit.  Dr. Edelman \nis the co-founder of a national full-service jury research firm.  (Dkt. 45-2 \nat 4.)  He has worked as a trial consultant for over fifteen years, in both \ncivil  and  criminal  cases,  and  has  been  retained  in  over  thirty  high-\nprofile cases to assess the impact of pretrial publicity.  (Id.)  The MDEQ \nEmployee Defendants retained Dr. Edelman “to evaluate the pretrial \npublicity surrounding the water situation in Flint, conduct a community \nattitude  survey,  and  on  the  basis  of  [his]  analysis,  make  a \n                                      \n1 Defendants Howard Croft, Michael Glasgow, Darnell Earley, Gerald Ambrose, and \nNancy Peeler did not file any notice or response related to this motion to change \nvenue.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   ECF No. 113   filed 01/23/17    PageID.4421    Page 5 of 18\nrecommendation  to  the  Court  on  whether  any  remedial  measures, \nincluding a change of venue, may be appropriate to protect the MDEQ \n[Employee] [D]efendants’ due process rights.”  (Id.) \nCiting  decades  of  social  science  research,  Dr.  Edelman  declares \nthat “[w]hen exposure to media coverage surrounding a case is broad, \nextensive, and redundant, strong links between relevant attitudes and \nbeliefs  about  the  victims,  plaintiffs,  defendants,  and  evidence  as \npresented  through  the  media  will  form.”    (Id.  at  9,  11-14.)    “If  the \npretrial publicity repeatedly links certain attitudes and beliefs, over the \ncourse of a trial these attitudes are likely to be automatically activated \nand  serve  as  a  prism  through  which  trial  testimony  is  cognitively \nprocessed.”    (Id.)    These  “[a]ttitudes  can  also  have  an  impact  on \nattention and recall,” in which “attitudinally supporting arguments will \nbe  more  closely  attended  to  .  .  .  during  deliberations”  than \n“counterarguments  and  evidence  conflicting  with  well-established \nattitudes [that] create cognitive dissonance.”  (Id. at 10.)  As a result, \n“these psychological processes can put the defendant at a significant \ndisadvantage by unfairly shifting the burden of proof away from the \nplaintiffs.”  (Id. at 11.) \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   ECF No. 113   filed 01/23/17    PageID.4422    Page 6 of 18\nAs  to  this  particular  case,  Dr.  Edelman  did  an  analysis  of  the \nDetroit Free Press’s coverage between April 25, 2014, and June 6, 2016.  \n(Id. at 14.)  According to Dr. Edelman, the “[r]esults indicate that this \ncase has generated massive and pervasive coverage, which has actually \nincreased with the passage of time.”  (Id.)  Dr. Edelman identified 718 \narticles that related to the Flint water situation, “including 643 the first \nsix months of 2016 alone.”  (Id. at 14-15.)  To highlight only a few of his \nfindings,  Dr.  Edelman  declares  that  the  word  “crisis”  appeared  1695 \ntimes  in  these  articles,  and  the  phrase  “water  crisis”  appeared  885 \ntimes.  (Id. at 16.)  The words “lead poisoning” were used 319 times, and \n“poison” was used in other contexts an additional 235 times.  (Id.)  The \nemphasis on the risk to children was “demonstrated by the fact that the \nword appeared over 1000 times.”  (Id. at 17.) \nAccording to Dr. Edelman, “the notion that government officials \nknew  about  problems  with  the  drinking  water,  failed  to  take  basic \nprotective  measures,  and  then  covered  up  what  they  knew”  was \nevidenced  by  eighteen  mentions  of  “red  flags,”  fifty-five  mentions  of \n“ignored,”  forty-six  mentions  of  “alarm,”  and  twenty-one  mentions  of \n“whistle  blowers.”  (Id.  at  17.)    There  were  also  “hundreds  more” \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   ECF No. 113   filed 01/23/17    PageID.4423    Page 7 of 18\nreferences  “to  government  emails  [that]  showed  growing  concerns \nbehind closed doors.”  (Id.) \nA  telephone  survey  was  also  conducted  by  randomly  dialing \nindividuals located in the Ann Arbor Division jury pool, which includes \nJackson, Lenawee, Monroe, Oakland, Washtenaw, and Wayne Counties.  \n(Id. at 18.)  The survey resulted in complete responses from 373 jury \neligible residents from the Ann Arbor Division.  (Id. at 19.)  To highlight \nonly some of the responses, 95% of the 373 responders had read, seen, \nor heard about the water situation in Flint, and 71% had also read, \nseen, or heard about the lawsuits being filed by Flint residents against \ncity and state public officials.  (Id. at 20.) \nAmong the 71% who had read, seen, or heard about the lawsuits, \n83%  believe  that  city  and  state  public  officials  acted  with  reckless \ndisregard for the public’s safety by exposing them to high levels of lead \nin the drinking water, 57% of whom hold these beliefs strongly.  (Id. at \n21.)  And 83% of those who had read, seen, or heard about the water \nsituation  but  not  the  lawsuits  responded  that  they  would  favor \nplaintiffs “if selected to be a juror in [such a] case at the start of trial,” \n54% of whom would “strongly favor” the plaintiffs.  (Id.)  Finally, among \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   ECF No. 113   filed 01/23/17    PageID.4424    Page 8 of 18\nthose who had read, seen, or heard about the lawsuits, 72% answered \n“yes” to the question:  “Given what you already know about events in \nFlint,  would  city  and  state  public  officials  have  a  difficult  time \nconvincing  you  that  they  did  not—repeat  did  not—act  with  reckless \ndisregard  for  the  public’s  safety?”    (Id.  at  22.)    Of  those  who  were \nfamiliar with the water situation but not the lawsuits, 69% responded \n“yes.”  (Id.) \nAccording to Dr. Edelman, “[g]iven the extent and nature of the \nmedia  coverage  in  the  Ann  Arbor  Division—coupled  with  the  deep \nseeded [sic] prejudice that is pervasive in the jury pool— . . . voir dire \nwould not provide a reasonable safeguard for protecting the defendants’ \nfair trial rights.”  (Id. at 42.)  He suggests that it is “[]in the interest of \njustice to transfer the[] case[] outside the Eastern District to a venue in \na different media market.”  (Id.)  As to venue, Dr. Edelman advises that \n“there is a concerning level of prejudice” throughout Michigan, and thus \nthe case should “be transferred to a venue outside of Michigan.”  (Id. at \n55.)   Short of that, Dr. Edelman advises transferring the case to “the \nMarquette  Division”  of  the  Western  District,  which  he  suggests \n“represents the least prejudicial jury pool in the state.”  (Id. at 55.) \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   ECF No. 113   filed 01/23/17    PageID.4425    Page 9 of 18\nII.  Standard \nUnder 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a), a district court may transfer any civil \naction to any other district or division if:  (1) the action could have been \nbrought in the proposed transferee court; (2) the transfer will promote \nthe interests of justice; and (3) the transfer would serve the parties’ and \nwitnesses’ convenience.  See United States v. P.J. Dick Inc., 79 F. Supp. \n2d 803, 805-06 (E.D. Mich. 2000).  The Court has broad discretion to \ntransfer a case in this manner.  Amphion, Inc. v. Buckeye Elec. Co., 285 \nF. Supp. 2d 943, 947 (E.D. Mich. 2003). \nTo determine whether the statute’s requirements have been met, \nthe Court “weigh[s] in the balance a number of case-specific factors.”  \nStewart Org., Inc. v. Ricoh Corp., 487 U.S. 22, 32 (1988).  Those factors \ninclude: \n(1) The convenience of the parties; (2) the convenience of the \nwitnesses;  (3)  the  location  of  relevant  documents  and \nrelative ease of access to sources of proof; (4) the locus of the \noperative facts; (5) the availability of process to compel the \nattendance of unwilling witnesses; (6) the relative means of \nthe  parties;  (7)  the  forum’s  familiarity  with  the  governing \nlaw; (8) the weight accorded the plaintiff’s choice of forum; \nand (9) trial efficiency and the interests of justice, based on \nthe totality of the circumstances. \n \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   ECF No. 113   filed 01/23/17    PageID.4426    Page 10 of 18\nOverland,  Inc.  v.  Taylor,  79  F.  Supp.  2d  809,  811  (E.D.  Mich.  2000) \n(citations omitted).   \nA  plaintiff’s  choice  of  forum  will  generally  be  given  substantial \ndeference. See, e.g., Audi AG & Volkswagen of Am. v. D’Amato, 341 F. \nSupp. 2d 734, 749 (E.D. Mich. 2004).  However, “a plaintiff’s chosen \nforum is not sacrosanct and will not defeat a well-founded motion for \nchange of venue.”  Thomas v. Home Depot, U.S.A., Inc., 131 F. Supp. 2d \n934,  937  (E.D.  Mich.  2001).    The  moving  party  bears  the  burden  of \ndemonstrating that, in light of these factors, “fairness and practicality \nstrongly favor the forum to which transfer is sought.”  Id. at 936. \nIII.  Analysis \nThe MDEQ Employee Defendants argue that a change of venue is \nnecessary  to  protect  defendants’  constitutional  right  to  an  impartial \njury, and alternatively, that transfer to the Northern Division of the \nWestern  District  of  Michigan  is  “in  the  interest  of  justice”  under  28 \nU.S.C. § 1404(a).2  (See Dkt. 45.)  Defendant City of Flint argues that \n                                      \n2 At the January 4, 2017 hearing, attorney Dennis Egan, arguing on behalf of the \nMDEQ  Employee  Defendants,  stated  that  his  clients  were  not  seeking  transfer \nunder  § 1404(a),  and  thus  the  Sixth  Circuit’s  multi-factor  considerations  do  not \napply.  But his co-counsel clarified that the MDEQ Employee Defendants are in fact \nseeking transfer under § 1404(a), specifically arguing that transfer would promote \nthe “interests of justice.” \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   ECF No. 113   filed 01/23/17    PageID.4427    Page 11 of 18\nsuch transfer would be unduly burdensome to the city and is otherwise \npremature.    (See  Dkt.  69.)    Plaintiffs  argue  that  the  motion  is \npremature, without merit, and the evidence flawed and insufficient for \nthe Court to “presume prejudice” under the applicable standard.  (See \nDkt. 94.) \nThe “right to an impartial jury in civil cases is inherent in the \nSeventh Amendment’s preservation of a ‘right to trial by jury’ and the \nFifth Amendment’s guarantee that ‘no person shall be denied of life, \nliberty[,] or property without due process of law.’”  McCoy v. Goldston, \n652 F.2d 654, 657 (6th Cir. 1981) (citing Kiernan v. VanSchaik, 347 \nF.2d 775, 778 (3rd Cir. 1965)); see Skaggs v. Otis Elevator Co., 164 F.3d \n511, 514-15 (10th Cir. 1998).  District courts have “a large discretion in \nruling on the issue of prejudice resulting from the reading by jurors of \nnews articles concerning the trial.”  United States v. Van Dyke, 605 F.2d \n220, 229 (6th Cir. 1979) (citing Marshall v. United States, 360 U.S. 310, \n312 (1959)).  “Each case must turn on its special facts.”  Id. \nMany of the most relevant cases are criminal cases.  In such cases, \ncourts attempt to determine whether a jury, which has already reached \na  verdict,  may  be  presumed  to  have  been  prejudiced  by  local  media \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   ECF No. 113   filed 01/23/17    PageID.4428    Page 12 of 18\ncoverage.  See Skilling v. United States, 561 U.S. 358, 383-84 (2010) (no \npresumption of prejudice in part because jury acquitted defendant of \nnine counts).  Such holdings are ill suited to this case.  Even so, the case \nlaw  weighs  against  finding  at  this  time  that  a  potential  future  jury \nwould be biased. \nIn  the  criminal  context,  jury  verdicts  are  overturned  when  a \nconvicted defendant establishes a “presumption of prejudice” among the \njurors, which “attends only the extreme case.”  Id. at 381.  This occurs \nwhen  “a  conviction  obtained  in  a trial  atmosphere  .  .  .  [was]  utterly \ncorrupted  by  press  coverage,”  but  this  does  not  mean  “that  juror \nexposure to . . . news accounts of the crime . . . alone presumptively \ndeprives the defendant of due process.”  See id. (quotations omitted). \nThe Supreme Court has “emphasized in prior decisions the size \nand characteristics of the community in which the crime occurred.”  Id. \nat  382.    Second,  the  Court  has  considered  whether  news  stories \n“contained [a] confession or other blatantly prejudicial information of \nthe type readers or viewers could not reasonably be expected to shut \nfrom sight.”  Id.  Third, the Court has considered whether “trial swiftly \nfollowed a widely reported crime,” or whether there is a lapse in time.  \n12 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   ECF No. 113   filed 01/23/17    PageID.4429    Page 13 of 18\nId. at 383.  And fourth, “of prime significance,” the Court has considered \nwhether the jury’s verdict “undermine[s] in any way the supposition of \njuror bias,” for example, by acquitting a defendant of any counts.  Id. \nHere, as in Skilling, there is a “large, diverse pool of potential \njurors,” and thus “the suggestion that 12 impartial individuals could not \nbe  empaneled  is  hard  to  sustain.”    Id.  at  382.    According  to \nAdministrative Order 14-AO-064 of the United States District Court for \nthe Eastern District of Michigan, there are 2,875,704 eligible jurors in \nthe Ann Arbor Division.  Compare id. (relevant jury pool 4.5 million).  \nThis is in stark contrast to the example highlighted by the Supreme \nCourt as a small community, 150,000, which would weigh in favor of a \nfinding of presumed prejudice.  Id. (citing Rideau v. Louisiana, 373 U.S. \n723,  724-27  (1963)  (presuming  prejudice  when  tens  of  thousands  in \ncommunity  of  150,000  residents  saw  video  recording  of  defendant’s \ninterrogation  and  detailed  confession  on  television)).    This  first \nconsideration weighs against a change of venue. \nAs  to  the  second  consideration,  Dr.  Edelman’s  media  analysis \nhighlights  some  reporting  that  could  be  considered  “confessions”  or \notherwise “prejudicial information.”  See id.  For example, defendant \n13 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   ECF No. 113   filed 01/23/17    PageID.4430    Page 14 of 18\nWyant  resigned,  apologized,  and  acknowledged  “mistakes”  by  the \ndepartment,  and  defendant  Wurfel  resigned,  acknowledged  mistakes, \nand then apologized to the residents of Flint.  (Dkt. 45 at 47.)  Other \nstate officials either apologized for the “systematic failures” of “career \nbureaucrats” at the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality or \nstated that such individuals “concealed the truth” and “were criminally \nwrong to do so.”  (Id. at 15, 47-48.) \nThese “confessions” are significantly different from the confession \nthat  resulted  in  a  presumption  of  prejudice  in  Rideau,  in  which  the \ndefendant,  “in  jail,  flanked  by  the  sheriff  and  two  state  troopers, \nadmitt[ed]  in  detail  the  commission  of  the  robbery,  kidnapping,  and \nmurder.”  See Rideau, 373 U.S. at 725.  And although this consideration \nmight  weigh  in  slight  favor  of  presuming  prejudice,  it  is  not  very \npersuasive.    Jurors  who  will  have  read  or  heard  about  such \n“confessions” by the MDEQ Employee Defendants could be effectively \nscreened  by  using  a  preliminary  questionnaire  and  during  voir  dire.  \nSee,  e.g.,  Skilling,  561  U.S.  at  384  (“Although  the  widespread \ncommunity impact necessitated careful identification and inspection of \nprospective jurors’ connections to [defendant’s company], the extensive \n14 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   ECF No. 113   filed 01/23/17    PageID.4431    Page 15 of 18\nscreening questionnaire and followup voir dire were well suited to that \ntask.”). \nAs  to  the  third  consideration,  trial  here  is  unlikely  to  “swiftly \nfollow[] a widely reported crime.”  Id. at 383.  The motions to dismiss \nwill not be heard until the end of March, at the earliest.  No discovery \nhas been conducted, and no trial date has been set.  It seems likely that \nby the time trial commences, “the decibel level of media attention” will \nhave  “diminished  somewhat.”    See  id.    This  consideration  weighs \nagainst changing venue. \nFinally,  the  fourth  consideration  does  not  apply  to  this  case, \nbecause no jury verdict has been reached.  The Supreme Court refers to \nthis consideration as “of prime significance.”  Id.  Its inapplicability to \nthis case weighs against changing venue at this time. \nThe MDEQ Employee Defendants argue that “[t]he appropriate \ntime  for  the  transfer  is  now.”    (Dkt.  45  at  54.)    However,  the  Sixth \nCircuit has directed that “[t]he proper occasion for such determination \nis upon the voir dire examination.”  McCoy v. Goldston, 652 F.2d 654, \n657 (6th Cir. 1981).  Relatedly, this Court is loathe to burden another \n15 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   ECF No. 113   filed 01/23/17    PageID.4432    Page 16 of 18\ncourt at this stage, given the number of dispositive motions that remain \nunresolved. \nAs set forth above, the relevant jury pool is very large and diverse, \nthe Court can endeavor to effectively screen potential jurors who will \nhave seen prejudicial media coverage, trial is likely a long way off, and \nthe  consideration  “of  prime  significance”  is  inapplicable  to  this  case.  \nThe  motion  to  change  venue  on  the  basis  of  due  process  is  denied \nwithout prejudice, because it is premature.  See Skilling, 561 U.S. at \n384 (2010) (“[H]indsight shows the efficacy of [the extensive screening \nquestionnaire and followup voir dire]; . . . jurors’ links to [defendant’s \ncompany] were either nonexistent or attenuated.”); Barnes v. Century \nAluminum Co., No. 05-62, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66054, at *17 (D.V.I. \nMay 9, 2013) (“It is premature . . . to determine so far in advance of trial \nwhether  defendants  can  receive  a  fair  and  impartial  trial  [in  this \ndistrict] as the Constitution demands.”). \nAlternatively, the MDEQ Employee Defendants seek transfer to \nthe Northern Division of the Western District “in the interest of justice” \nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a).  According to these defendants, it is “widely \naccepted  that  the  ‘interest  of  justice’  factor  is  the  paramount \n16 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   ECF No. 113   filed 01/23/17    PageID.4433    Page 17 of 18\nconsideration under [§] 1404(a),” and this alone requires that the Court \ntransfer venue.  (Dkt. 45 at 56-59.)  The MDEQ Employee Defendants \ndo not make any arguments as to the multiple factors that must be \nconsidered before granting such a motion.  See Overland, Inc. v. Taylor, \n79 F. Supp. 2d 809, 811 (E.D. Mich. 2000); see also Stewart Org., Inc. v. \nRicoh Corp., 487 U.S. 22, 32 (1988). \nNearly every factor weighs against transferring the case:  this is \nplaintiffs’ chosen venue, no party disputes that this district is where the \nrelevant conduct occurred, most of the defendants reside here, all of the \nplaintiffs  reside  here,  and  most,  if  not  all,  of  the  witnesses  and \ndocumentary evidence are here.  And because, as set forth above, the \nMDEQ  Employee  Defendants  have  not  shown  that  a  potential  jury \nshould be presumed biased at this time, they fail to meet their burden \nto  establish  that  the  case  should  otherwise  be  transferred  in  the \ninterest of justice.  The motion to change venue under § 1404(a) is thus \ndenied. \nTo be sure, if the Court cannot empanel an impartial jury when \nthe time comes, defendants will be invited to renew their motion for \nchange of venue. \n17 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   ECF No. 113   filed 01/23/17    PageID.4434    Page 18 of 18\nIV.  Conclusion \nFor the reasons set forth above, the MDEQ Employee Defendants’ \nmotion to change venue (Dkt. 45), as joined by defendants Veolia North \nAmerica, LLC, Lockwood, Andrews and Newnam, Inc., and Robert Scott \n(Dkts. 60, 107, 111), is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE. \n  IT IS SO ORDERED. \nDated: January 23, 2017    s/Judith E.

Majzoub \n    Defendants. \n_______________________________________________________________/ \nMDEQ DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR CHANGE OF VENUE \n*ORAL ARGUMENT REQUESTED* \nCurrent  and  former  employees  of  the  Michigan  Department  of \nEnvironmental Protection (“MDEQ”), Defendants Stephen Busch, Patrick Cook, \nMichael  Prysby,  Liane  Shekter  Smith,  Bradley  Wurfel,  and  Daniel  Wyant \n(collectively, the “MDEQ Defendants”), by and through their counsel of record, \nand  pursuant  to  the  Court’s  general  supervisory  power,  the  Fifth  and  Seventh \nAmendments to the United States Constitution, and 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a), move for \na transfer of venue because the local media’s overwhelming and adverse publicity \nof this matter has made it nearly impossible for a fair and impartial jury to be \nempaneled in this Judicial District and, perhaps, the State of Michigan1:  \n                                                            \n1 On October 21, 2016, the MDEQ Defendants filed this Motion for Change of \nVenue and Brief in Support in Mays v. Snyder, Case No. 5:15-cv-14002, which is \ncurrently pending before Judge O’Meara. \n1 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 2 of 62    Pg ID 224\n \n1.  Legal trials are not like elections, to be won through the use of the \nmeeting-hall, the radio, and the newspaper. It has long been recognized that both \ncivil and criminal defendants are entitled to a fair trial by an impartial jury. This \nright is sacrosanct. Where the right is jeopardized due to substantial amounts of \nadverse pretrial publicity and community bias, courts (especially federal courts \nwielding  broad  supervisory  power)  must  take  protective  measures  such  as \nchanging venue. \n2.  As explained by Dr. Bryan Edelman, a top expert on adverse publicity \nand juror bias, potential jurors exposed to significant quantities of inflammatory \npublicity  and  hostile  community  sentiment  are  likely  to  form  preconceived \nattitudes and opinions regarding both litigants and triable questions of fact. (See \nDeclaration of Dr. Bryan Edelman, attached as Exhibit A). Once formed these \ncase-specific attitudes and opinions are not readily subject to change and actually \nnegatively alter the way in which jurors cognitively process evidence during the \ncourse of trial. (Id. ¶¶ 16-30.) As one popular juror statement goes, “you can’t \nforget what you hear and see.” (Id. ¶¶ 69, 90). \n3.  It thus follows that in those rare cases where “there is massive media \ncoverage and pervasive prejudice within the jury pool, voir dire does not serve a \nreliable prophylactic measure for protecting a defendant’s due process rights.” (Id. \n¶ 66.) In his Declaration, Dr. Edelman explains at length the ineffectiveness of voir \ndire  in  cases  of  exceptional  adverse  publicity  and  juror  bias.  (Id.  ¶¶  66-91.) \nConsequently, in the face of widespread negative news coverage and galvanized \ncommunity prejudice, it is incumbent on courts to transfer venue at the outset of a \n2 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 3 of 62    Pg ID 225\n \nproceeding. (Id. ¶¶ 5, 66, 91, 111-13). This is especially true where, as here, there \nexists no reason to believe prejudicial media coverage in an adversely-affected and \nhostile community will subside leading up to a sensational trial. (Id. ¶¶ 31, 34, \n112.) Failure to change venue promptly in such cases, (a) deprives the eventual \ntransferee court of the rightful duty to manage and shape the case ultimately tried; \nand (b) greatly prejudices defendants where failed attempts to empanel juries and \nresultant venue changes on the eve of trial attract enormous and unfortunately-\ntimed adverse media coverage.            \n4.  In  this  case,  news  broke  of  potential  lead  contamination  in  Flint \nalmost two years ago, and the Flint water “crisis” was born. The news accounts, \nwhich are too great in number to fully categorize here, have included front page \npictures,  featured  stories,  in-depth  analyses,  editorials,  letters  to  the  editors, \npictures of key individuals, and biting political cartoons, and have described the \nsituation in Flint as a public health disaster, drinking water emergency, regulatory \nfailure and cover-up, and even a moral failure of astronomic proportions inflicted \non  a  poor  and  primarily  African-American  community.2  The  matter  has  been \nheavily politicized and sensationalized. As described in further detail below, both \nthe quality and quantity of the media reports have been extremely prejudicial to \nDefendants,  particularly  the  MDEQ  Defendants,  and  caused  tremendous  juror \nprejudice throughout most the State of Michigan.  \n \n                                                            \n2 An appendix summarizing just a small fraction of this prejudicial news coverage \nis attached as Exhibit B. \n3 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 4 of 62    Pg ID 226\n \nCONTENT OF THE ADVERSE PUBLICITY \n5.  The  content  of  the  coverage  saturating  the  State  (particularly  the \nEastern District) refers to indifferent and racist state bureaucrats who in callous \ndisregard of public safety decided to use tainted and corrosive Flint River water \nresulting in the lead poisoning of thousands, unacceptably high levels of lead in \nchildren, a deadly Legionnaires’ outbreak, civil lawsuits, criminal charges, and \ngeneral distrust and distress among Flint’s citizens. \n6.  Lead Poisoning: Provocative stories from local media have uniformly \ndescribed exposure to “high levels” of “lead” in Flint’s drinking water as a “mass” \n“poisoning” caused by government officials.3 One example comes from a January \n21,  2016  MLive  story  entitled:  “HOW  GOVERNMENT  POISONED  THE \nPEOPLE OF FLINT.” (Id. ¶ 95.) As if the headline was not prejudicial enough, the \nstory  was  preceded  by  the  following  collage  depicting  dirty  water,  poisoned \nchildren, and an outraged community: \n \n                                                            \n3 See Ex. B ¶¶ 3, 7-8, 10, 14-15, 17, 32, 38, 48, 49, 55, 60, 68, 73, 75, 77, 79-81, \n89-90, 95, 101, 103, 106-07, 118, 122, 131-32, 135-37, 141, 149-50, 152, 157, \n159-65, 173, 175, 182, 185, 188, 191, 194, 197, 199, 203, 206, 209, 214-15, 217-\n18, 222-23, 227, 231, 233,  235-36, 238-39, 241.\n \n4 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 5 of 62    Pg ID 227\n \n7.  The  story  begins  with  the  premise  that:  “Flint  water  has  poisoned \nmore than just its children . . . It’s poisoned the citizenry’s faith in government.” \nThe article then quotes statements from Flint residents one of who commented: \n“Somebody needs to go to jail for this, man . . . They’re poisoning an entire \ncommunity. A generation of kids will never recover from this.  And it’s all just to \nsave a few dollars. They played a game of chess with our lives and we lost.” (Id.) \n8.  Among many other prejudicial tales, the article then describes Flint as \n“something out of a disaster movie”; compares Flint water to “toxic waste”; says \nthat Flint water may “have tainted a generation of Flint children”; reinforces myths \nthat Flint water was “too corrosive for General Motors to build cars”; states that \npublic officials “turned a blind eye to the problem”; portrays a picture of a vast \ngovernment conspiracy and cover-up; and then highlights the resignations, firings, \nand apologies of several Defendants in this case. (Id.) \n9.  Legionnaires’  Outbreak:  Local  media  accounts  have  blamed  the \noutbreak of Legionnaires’ disease and resulting deaths on Flint water4 even though \nthere is no scientific basis for such allegations and despite contrary findings by the \nCenter  for  Disease  Control  (“CDC”),  United  States  Environmental  Protection \nAgency (“EPA”), and others. For example, the Detroit Free Press on January 22, \n2016,  published  an  article  entitled:  “LEGIONNAIRES’  EXPERT  BLAMES \nSPIKE IN CASES ON FLINT WATER.” (Id. ¶ 180.) A close inspection of the text \n                                                            \n4 Id. ¶¶ 1, 10, 13-14, 21, 25-26, 29, 32-34, 37, 41, 55, 66, 70, 88-90, 95, 100, 102, \n107, 134, 163, 175, 178, 180, 182-83, 191, 193-94, 198-99, 202, 222, 233, 236.\n \n5 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 6 of 62    Pg ID 228\n \nof the article reveals that the alleged national expert has no scientific evidence to \nsupport her aspersions. (Id.)   \n10.  Similarly, on February 4, 2016, the Detroit News published an article \nentitled: “MICHIGAN OFFICIALS WARNED OF WATER, LEGIONNAIRES’ \nLINK.” (Id. ¶ 88.) This investigative-styled article, like many others, sifts through \nthe emails of several government officials (including Defendants) and then implies \nknowledge of and disregard for an alleged connection between Flint water and the \noutbreak  of  Legionnaires  disease.  (Id.)  A  careful  review  of  the  text,  however, \nshows that each time reference is made to the alleged “link” between Legionnaires \ndisease and the Flint river water, it is preceded by the qualifiers such as “possible,” \n“likely contributed,” and “likely came from.” (Id.) \n11.  Portrayals of MDEQ Defendants: Media coverage of Flint’s switch \nto the Flint River as its drinking water source and subsequent developments has \nprovoked  and  inflamed  community  opinion  and  unfairly  depicted  the  MDEQ \nDefendants as indifferent or bumbling bureaucrats, criminals, and even racists. In \ntheir reports, the local media has blamed the MDEQ Defendants, early and often, \ndescribing their conduct as “grossly negligent” and “criminal.” They have reported \nthat  the  MDEQ  Defendants  “purposely”  or  “recklessly  disregarded”  water \nregulations, “incompetently” failed to require corrosion treatment, “devised” ways \nto avoid detecting lead when collecting water samples, instructed Flint officials to \n6 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 7 of 62    Pg ID 229\n \n“throw out” lead data, refused to follow testing protocols, “ignored warning signs,” \nand failed to exercise “common sense.”5  \n12.  There has been almost no mention of exculpatory evidence or the \npresumption of innocence, and the fact that all these allegations are or will be \ncontested has not been paid lip service by the media.   \n13.  Some of the most powerful reporting has occurred when several of the \nMDEQ  Defendants  were  charged  with  crimes  by  prospective  gubernatorial \nfrontrunner and current Attorney General, Bill Schuette, and his special prosecutor, \nTodd  Flood.6  In  such  accounts,  the  media  pasted  images  of  each  Defendant \nstanding before a court to face the criminal allegations, surrounded by the flashing \nlights of reporters, and/or evoking Fifth Amendment Rights. (Id.) The media even \nslapped pictures the MDEQ Defendants on an October 4, 2016 article entitled \n“AMID  WATER  CRISIS,  FLINT  FACES  A  SHIGELLOSIS  OUTBREAK,”  a \nmatter having absolutely nothing to do with Flint water. (Id. ¶ 243.) \n14.  If such coverage was not already prejudicial enough, adding further \ninsult and prejudice against the MDEQ Defendants is the fact that headline stories \ncontain Defendant Snyder’s views that the MDEQ Defendants are responsible for \nthe Flint water “crisis.”7 For example, the Detroit News in an article dated April \n11, 2016 reported under the headline of “SNYDER: CAREER BUREAUCRATS \n                                                            \n5Id. ¶¶ 15, 17, 65, 79-80, 84, 87, 89-92, 100, 102-06, 110, 152, 161, 172, 175-76, \n \n181-82, 184-85, 188, 190-93, 199, 201, 204-09, 211, 215, 217-18, 222, 224. \n \n6 Id. ¶¶ 103-04, 107, 165-67, 169, 172-73, 181, 183, 190, 193, 198, 202,  217, 221. \n7 Id. ¶¶ 172, 175, 181, 188, 194, 209, 218, 238, 245.  \n7 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 8 of 62    Pg ID 230\n \nTO BLAME FOR FLINT CRISIS” as follows: “Gov. Rick Snyder on Monday laid \nblame for Flint’s water crisis on ‘career bureaucrats’ with an ‘an absolute lack of \ncommon sense.’” (Id. ¶ 188.) \n15.  Media coverage has also latched on to conjecture that the decisions \nleading to Flint’s water woes, as well as the State’s response to the community, \nhave been racially discriminatory. A common sentiment in media accounts is that \nif Flint had been richer or whiter, the decision to switch to the Flint River never \nwould have occurred. (Id. ¶¶ 75-76, 79, 102, 118, 194, 214, 241.)  For example, \nCrain’s Detroit Business reported on United States Senator Debbie Stabenow’s \nstatements  that  “there’s  no  doubt”  in  her  mind  that  if  the  water  problem  had \noccurred  in  a  wealthy,  white  community,  the  State  would  have  responded \nimmediately. (Id. ¶ 79). More recently, a Democratic lawmaker from Flint accused \nleaders in Congress of “refusing to approve emergency aid for the city’s water \ncrisis because a majority of Flint residents are African Americans.” (Id. ¶ 76.)  \n16.  The Flint water “crisis” has continually been called an instance of \n“environmental  racism.”  Headlines  have  declared:  “OFFICIALS  TO  HEAR \nTESTIMONY  OVER  DISCRIMINATION  CLAIMS  SURROUNDING  THE \nFLINT WATER CRISIS,” “HOW RACE, CLASS SET THE STAGE FOR FLINT \nWATER CRISIS,” and “FLINT LOOKS FOR RACIAL BIAS, WATER CRISIS \nLINK.” (Id. ¶¶ 74, 75, 198.) \n17.  Perhaps  the  most  racially  charged,  inflammatory,  and  prejudicial \nstatements broadcasted to date are those that have compared the current situation to \nsome  of  the  most  horrific  atrocities  in  history.  The  ACLU  of  Michigan  has \n8 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 9 of 62    Pg ID 231\n \nirresponsibly called the lead poisoning “genocide,” a sentiment echoed by several \ncelebrities. (Id. ¶¶ 194, 196-97.) The Michigan President of the “National Action \nNetwork” has been quoted as saying Flint water is “almost as bad as gas chambers \nfor Jews.” (Id. ¶ 196.) Other media reports have compared the Flint water crisis to \nan act of “terrorism,” “Saddam Hussein,” and “Watergate.” (Id. ¶¶ 77, 194, 218, \n236, 241.) Cries of “remember Tuskegee” have reverberated through social media, \npublic protests, and public hearings. (Id. ¶¶ 163, 195.) \n18.  Citizen Distress and Distrust: Local media outlets have capitalized \non every powerful human emotion available: shock, fear, anxiety, anger, trust, \nsympathy, and grief. Distrust and questions regarding the integrity and competence \nof the MDEQ have been rampant.8 People in Flint, supported by celebrities and \npoliticians, have called for the resignations, firings, and arrest of all involved.9 The \nresultant resignations, firings, and arrests have received ample coverage.10  \n19.  The  media,  in  more  recent  stories,  has  focused  on  the  alleged \nuncertainty and stress created by the alleged poisoning. The Detroit Free Press on \npage 1 of its Sunday edition of August 7, 2016, under the headline “FLINT’S \nGROWING MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS” reported that: “[a] widespread concern \nfor residents throughout the lead-poisoned city is not knowing how they, or their \n                                                            \n8 Id. ¶¶ 30, 49, 58-59, 75, 77, 81, 88, 100, 102, 106, 120-23, 137, 149, 152, 158, \n162-65, 171, 182-83, 196-97, 199, 213, 219, 228, 231, 233, 242-43.  \n9 Id. ¶¶ 22, 58, 77, 88,  92, 127, 131-32, 134-35, 140, 160-61, 168, 181, 188, 194, \n199, 208, 213-15, 223, 235-36, 238, 240.  \n10 Id. ¶¶ 8, 13-14, 26, 59, 77, 88, 90-92, 101, 106, 127, 131, 135, 140, 160-61, 168-\n70, 172, 189-94, 199, 207, 217, 221, 238, 242.\n \n9 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 10 of 62    Pg ID 232\n \nchildren  and  grandchildren,  may  be  impacted  because  of  exposure  to  the \ncontaminated water.” (Id. ¶ 81.) As a result, the article says Flint residents “are \nexperiencing mental health issues caused by the ongoing water crisis, including \nstress,  anxiety  and  fear  .  .  .  .”  (Id.)  The  article  also  says  that  “[d]istrust  of \ngovernment officials remains rampant” and Flint residents “don’t believe it when \nthey are told the [water] filters make water safe from the lead when properly used, \npointing out they once were told there water was safe when it wasn’t.” (Id.) \n20.  Civil  Lawsuits:  Not  surprisingly,  numerous  lawsuits  (including \nmultiple class actions) have been filed in various courts against the City of Flint \nand  its  Emergency  Managers,  the  State  of  Michigan,  the  Governor  and  State \nemployees, professional consultants, and potentially against the EPA. This flood of \nlawsuits brought by personal injury lawyers from across the Country has provoked \nextensive news coverage in Michigan.11  \n21.  As one April 14, 2016, Michigan Radio article entitled “OUT-OF-\nTOWN  LAWYERS  FLOW  INTO  FLINT,  FILING  WATER  CRISIS \nLAWSUITS,” explained: \nFlint residents continue to deal with unsafe lead levels in their water. \nAnother  group  is  paying  very  close  attention.  Lawyers.  Lots  of \nlawyers. \nTurn the TV on in Flint and you’ll likely hear a commercial with a \nvery specific question.  \n“If  you’ve  tested  positive  for  the  presence  of  lead  in  your  blood, \nexperienced  nausea,  hair  loss,  skin  loss  or  other  issues  after \nconsumption of Flint River water or property damage caused by the \n                                                            \n11 Id. ¶¶ 2, 10, 34, 55, 86, 93, 104, 107, 113, 165-66, 173, 182-83, 185, 195, 200-\n01, 203, 221.  \n10 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 11 of 62    Pg ID 233\n \nFlint River water system., you need to call ...” and at that point the \nannouncer gives the name and contact information for a New York \nlaw firm. \nAttorneys  are  swarming  around  Flint  –  advertising,  holding  public \nmeetings and even hosting clinics where adults and children can have \ntheir blood tested. [(Id. ¶ 200.)] \n22.  If such advertisements, public meetings, and legal clinics were not \ncause  enough  for  concern,  many  of  these  plaintiffs  lawyers  have  made  direct, \nprejudicial,  and  case-specific  statements  to  the  media.  In  a  February  2016 \nAssociated Press article, Hunter Shkolnik, counsel in the Waid case, asked “How \ncan they [(i.e., Defendants)] look at themselves in the mirror?” and stated that “It’s \nan embarrassment for government officials to take the safety of their citizens so \nlightly.” (Id. ¶ 183.) Similarly, Marc Bern, counsel in the Washington case, opined \nthat the situation in Flint pales in comparison to the health issues first responders \nsuffered following the collapse of the World Trade Center and then commented \nthat “We haven’t been attacked by foreign people . . . We’ve been attacked by \nthose who are here in Michigan.” (Id. ¶ 93.) \n23.   Not to be outdone, on September 20, 2016, Michael Pitt, lead counsel \nfor Plaintiffs in Mays v. Snyder, Case No. 5:15-cv-14002, where this motion was \noriginally filed, gave a highly inflammatory interview on Michigan Radio’s show \n“Stateside” where he described Defendants as “criminals” and “racists,” expressed \nshock that Defendants asserted their right to governmental immunity and a state-\nfunded legal defense, and then accused them of conducting an “experiment” with \n“poisonous”  water  on  the  “African  American  population  in  Flint.”  (See  Pitt \n11 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 12 of 62    Pg ID 234\n \nInterview Transcript, attached as Exhibit C). With respect to this last incredible \naccusation, Mr. Pitt stated: \nFirst, the whole process of running this highly polluted, high corrosive \nFlint River water through essentially dormant Flint Water Treatment \nPlant was an experiment. And I say it was an experiment because they \ndidn’t know if it was going to actually work. \n*  *  * \nIn fact, the two MDEQ employees who said go ahead and start the \nplant are now being criminally prosecuted for allowing the plant to go \nforward when it wasn’t adequate for the job at hand, and so, people \nwere being poisoned because of a failed experiment . . . moreover, this \nis a case of environmental racism. \n*  *  * \nSomebody had to take the brunt of the experiment.  Was it going to be \nthe African American community in Flint or was it going to be the \npredominantly white community surrounding Flint? And they chose to \nrun the experiment on the African American population in Flint, and \nthere was a tremendous amount of risk that was involved, and they \ndecided to expose the predominantly black community of Flint to the \nhigh risk of this experiment. The experiment failed; people got sick; \nsome people died; and here we are a year later with a terrible ordeal \nfor the people of Flint that, that cries out for justice. [(Id.)] \n24.  Politicization: At every level of government, the Flint water crisis has \nbeen marked by declarations of emergency, disputes over public aid packages, \nraucous  congressional  hearings,  fault-allocating  investigative  commissions,  and \nremarkably  uneducated  finger-pointing  from  both  sides  of  the  political  aisle, \nincluding  among  presidential  and  gubernatorial  contenders,  federal  and  state \nlegislators, and local officials.12 The lowness of this political discourse has been \n                                                            \n12 See Ex. B ¶¶ 39, 110, 122-23, 141, 152, 194, 204-16, 220, 222-25, 228-29. \n12 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 13 of 62    Pg ID 235\n \nlargely concentrated on the allocation of blame (much of it mistakenly toward the \nMDEQ Defendants). All of it has been highly publicized by the local media. \n25.  Between  December  2015  and  January  2016,  the  local,  state,  and \nfederal governments all declared states of emergency in response to Flint’s water \nsupply issues and the National Guard was called in to Flint to assist in distributing \nwater and water filters. President Obama’s declaration of federal emergency in \nFlint was praised in local media accounts by a number of politicians, including \nCongressman Dan Kildee (D-Flint) who said: “The residents and children of Flint \ndeserve every resource available to make sure that they have safe water and are \nable to recover from this terrible manmade disaster created by the state.” (Id. ¶ \n204.)  Months later, in May of 2016, President Obama gave a speech (heavily \ncovered by local media) to a crowded auditorium in Flint where he called on \nCongress to pass a sizable aid package and characterized the City’s water crisis as \nhaving resulted from “a corrosive attitude that exists in our politics that exists in \ntoo many levels of our government.” (Id. ¶ 205.)  \n26.  There  have  been  numerous  Congressional  hearings  concerning  the \nFlint  water  crisis,  including  a  notable  series  of  hearings  before  the  House \nCommittee on Oversight and Government Reform. These hearings were attended \nby large groups of Flint residents, were pervaded by a circus-like atmosphere often \nreferred to as a “finger-pointing affair,” and were widely and disproportionately \nreported on throughout Michigan, particularly in the Eastern District. (Id. ¶¶ 206-\n09.) Similarly, public aid packages for Flint have been a heated political issue with \nSenate  Democrats  recently  threatening  a  shutdown  of  the  entire  federal \n13 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 14 of 62    Pg ID 236\n \ngovernment over the issue. (Id. ¶¶ 210-11.) As both political parties continue to \ndebate this issue, local news outlets closely following the matter have been quick \nto criticize Congress for failing to pass any legislation providing monetary aid to \nFlint. (Id. ¶ 212.) \n27.  The crisis has also been a hot button issue for presidential hopefuls. \nOn March 6, 2016, a well-attended Democratic primary debate was held in Flint. \nBoth  Hilary  Clinton  and  her  then-opponent,  Bernie  Sanders,  were  eager  to \ncapitalize on the crowd’s emotions and the ample Michigan media attention. To \nrising cheers from the audience, Clinton said “[t]his is an emergency . . . [e]very \nday that goes by . . . is another lost day in a child’s life.” She then called for new \ninfrastructure  and  long-term  care  for  Flint’s  residents,  and  indicated  that  “[i]f \nMichigan won’t do it, there have to be ways that we can move and then make them \npay for it and hold them accountable.” Sanders, meanwhile, called for Defendant \nSnyder’s resignation before stating that “we are talking about . . . children being \npoisoned” and stating “[o]ne wonders if this had been a white suburban community \nwhat kind of response there might have been.” (Id. ¶ 214.) \n28.  Republicans have not ignored the issue. During a recent visit in Flint, \nRepublican nominee, Donald Trump, promised that Flint’s issues would “be fixed \nquickly and effectively” before stating: “It used to be that cars were made in Flint \nand you couldn’t drink the water in Mexico . . . Now cars are made in Mexico, and \nyou can’t drink the water in Flint. That’s terrible.” (Id. ¶ 216.) \n29.  Michigan’s presumed gubernatorial candidates also have been quick \nto cast blame and politicize the issue. Republican favorite Bill Schuette, along with \n14 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 15 of 62    Pg ID 237\n \nspecial prosecutors, Todd Flood and Noah Hall, have appeared on numerous media \noutlets and held multiple conferences concerning the crisis, and publically declared \nthat  at  least  five  of  the  MDEQ  Defendants  are  guilty  of  criminal  misconduct, \nstating that: “These individuals concealed the truth. They were criminally wrong to \ndo so . . . Their offenses vary, but there is an overall theme and repeated pattern. \nEach of these individuals attempted to bury, or cover up, to downplay or hide \ninformation . . . .” (Id. ¶ 217.)  \n30.  Ingham County Prosecutor, Gretchen Whitmer challenged the strategy \nof using the press to make the State’s criminal case against defendants, because of \nthe potential prejudicial impact of the jury pool. (Id. ¶ 246.) Although she is not the \nofficial leading the State’s criminal investigation, even Prosecutor Whitmer has \nmade her fair share of prejudicial comments regarding the crisis. Late last year, for \nexample, she appeared on in WKAR’s show “Off the Record” where she opined \nthat  the  Flint  water  “crisis”  was  caused  by  the  “callous  disregard”  of  public \nofficials  and  warned  citizens  to  question  whether  the  government  is  really \nprotecting them. \n31.  Others have chimed in as well, utilizing the ever eager local media to \npolitically capitalize on Flint’s situation. Congressman Dan Kildee (D-Flint) has \n“put  the  blame  squarely  on  the  feet  of  Republican  Gov.  Rick  Snyder  and  his \nadministration.”  (Id.  ¶  220.)  State  Senator  Jim  Ananich  (D-Flint)  has  been \noutspoken and critical of the MDEQ Defendants, in particular, saying “MDEQ \nmistakes had a devastating effect on [Flint],” (id. ¶ 221); that MDEQ’s culture \nunder Snyder led to the crisis, (id. ¶ 222); and that MDEQ was giving “false \n15 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 16 of 62    Pg ID 238\n \nstatements” to EPA, (id. ¶ 223). Lieutenant Governor Brian Calley has blamed \nMDEQ’s culture as one of “compliance” but not “safety,” ignoring the long-settled \nlaw that administrative agencies are creatures of statute invested with only those \npowers granted by the legislature. (Id. ¶ 172.) Meanwhile, former Congresswoman \nCandice Miller (R-Macomb) has called the crisis “an epic failure of government at \nevery level.” (Id. ¶ 224.) \n32.  Empirical Content Analysis: If there was any doubt, empirical data \ncollected by Dr. Edelman this past summer confirms that the Court’s jury pool has \nbeen “saturated with highly prejudicial and sensational news coverage surrounding \nwhat  is  often  described  by  the  media  as  the  ‘water  crisis’  in  Flint,  the  ‘lead-\npoisoning’ of children there, and the ‘failure’ of government officials to protect or \ndisclose the risk to the public.” (See Edelman Declaration (Ex. A) ¶ 3.)  \n33.  His media analysis of the Detroit Free Press, alone, identified 718 \narticles between April 25, 2014 and June 6, 2016. In these articles, the Detroit Free \nPress described the matter at issue here as a “crisis” 1,695 times and a “water \ncrisis” 885 times. (Id. ¶¶ 31, 36.) There were 319 references to “lead poisoning.” \n(Id. ¶ 37.) The quality of Flint drinking water was described as “foul” 36 times, \n“brown” 32 times, “discolored” 58 times, “smelly” 81 times, “toxic” 95 times, and \n“dangerous” 70 times. (Id.) References to “children” were made over 1,000 times. \nAnd, there were 372 mentions of “elevated blood levels,” 54 mentions of “brain \ndamage,” 116 mentions of irreversible “behavioral problems,” and 164 mentions of \n“rashes.” (Id. ¶ 38.) \n16 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 17 of 62    Pg ID 239\n \n34.  Dr. Edelman found that many of the articles he reviewed stated that \n“government officials knew about problems with the drinking water, failed to take \nbasic  protective  measures,  and  then  covered-up  what  they  knew.”  (Id.  ¶  39.) \nSpecifically, he found that there “were 18 mentions of ‘red flags,’ 55 to ‘ignored,’ \n46 to ‘alarm’ . . . and hundreds more to government emails which showed growing \nconcerns behind closed doors.” (Id.) As limited examples, Dr. Edelman cited to an \narticle  stating  that  “Flint  residents  complained  to  indifferent  state  officials  for \nnearly a year before whistle-blowers proved that children were being poisoned” \nand  identified  that  there  were  at  least  40  articles  stating  that  General  Motors \nstopped using Flint water because it was corrosive. (Id. ¶ 37, 39-40.)  \n35.  Based on this “limited content analysis,” Dr. Edelman concluded that \n“the nature of coverage surrounding this case incorporates the types of sensational \nand prejudicial reporting that can captivate the public’s attention, generate anger, \nand lead to widespread bias in the jury pool.”  (Id. ¶ 41.)  \nQUANTITY OF ADVERSE PUBLICITY \n36.   A Westlaw “News” search of the principal newspapers in the Eastern \nDistrict of Michigan (i.e., Detroit Free Press, Detroit News, and Flint Journal) for \narticles pertaining to the “Flint water crisis” produced an astounding number of \nresults. A search of the terms “Flint 5 water” for the period from April 24, 2014, \nthe  day  before  Flint  began  using  the  Flint  River  as  its  water  source,  through \nSeptember 26, 2016, produced the following results: (a) Detroit Free Press: 1,786 \narticles,  (Exhibit  D  );  (b)  Flint  Journal:  1,368  articles,  (Exhibit  E  );  and  (c) \nDetroit News: 567 articles, (Exhibit F).  \n17 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 18 of 62    Pg ID 240\n \n37.  Dr. Edelman’s media analysis of the 718 articles published by the \nDetroit Free Press between April 25, 2014 and June 6, 2016, also confirms that \nthis  case  has  “generated  massive  and  pervasive  coverage,  which  has  actually \nincreased with the passage of time.” (See Edelman Declaration (Ex. A) ¶ 31.)13 \nAccording to Dr. Edelman, media coverage from just the Detroit Free Press is \nover  eight  times  higher  than  the  median  number  of  news  articles  (i.e.,  88.5) \npresent in 52 cases studied by Dr. Edward Bronson, a respected jury expert and \nscholar, where a change of venue was granted. (Id. ¶ 33.). Accordingly, the 3,721 \narticles identified in the Westlaw search represent approximately forty-two times \nmore articles than the median of prejudicial articles reported in 52 cases where a \nchange of venue was granted. (Id.)14  \n38.  In contrast, the media’s reports in the Western District of Michigan \nhave been less voluminous. The Westlaw search of the Kalamazoo Gazette from \nApril 24, 2014 to September 26, 2016, produced 204 articles. (Exhibit H.) A \nsearch of the Traverse City Record Eagle produced 81 results for the same time \nperiod. (Exhibit I.) Westlaw does not have access to the Grand Rapids Press. \nHowever, counsel’s search of the Grand Rapids Press archives using a similar \nsearch phrase (“Flint adj5 water”) showed that the Grand Rapids Press, the leading \nnewspaper on the west side of the State, published 267 articles about the Flint \n                                                            \n13 An archive of the 718 Detroit Free Press articles is attached as Exhibit G. \n14 These figures do not incorporate articles from the other newspapers with \nsignificant circulation in the Eastern District. Nor do they take into account the \nmassive amount of radio, online and social media, and television coverage \ncirculated in this District. (Id. ¶ 32).  \n18 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 19 of 62    Pg ID 241\n \nwater matters from January 29, 2015 to September 26, 2016. (Exhibit J.) These \nthree  newspapers,  located  in  the  southern,  middle,  and  northern  parts  of  the \nWestern District, collectively published 552 articles pertaining to the “Flint water \ncrisis.”  This  is  approximately  12%  of  the  number  of  articles  published  in  the \nEastern District. The volume and frequency of newspaper articles in the Eastern \nDistrict vastly exceed those published in the Western District. \n39.  The  media  coverage  of  the  Flint  water  “crisis”  shows  no  signs  of \nwaning. In fact, all signs indicate that the local media’s continued thirst to provide \nnews of the “crisis” will only intensify as the criminal and civil cases inch toward \nwhat will surely be portrayed as a salacious trial. (See Edelman Declaration (Ex. \nA) ¶¶ 31, 34, 112.) \nCOMMUNITY REACTION TO ADVERSE PUBLICITY \n40.  According  to  Defendant  Snyder’s  Flint  water  website,  over \n32,400,000 liters of bottled water, 130,000 filters, and 290,000 cartridges have \nbeen distributed to the residents of Flint. The State of Michigan, as of August \n2016, has appropriated over $200,000,000 to address safe drinking water, food and \nnutrition, social development, physical well-being, and water-bill issues in Flint. \nThe federal government, likewise, has made available a tremendous amount of \nresources and services to the people of Flint, including $20,000,000 in road repair \nfunds, and is in the process of appropriating additional funds. \n41.  Countless private philanthropic organizations across the State have \nraised a tremendous amount of support for Flint residents. To name just a few \nexamples, the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation reports that a collaboration of 10 \n19 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 20 of 62    Pg ID 242\n \nfoundations will work together to help the city of Flint recover from its water crisis \nand have committed a total of nearly $125,000,000 in funding, (id. ¶ 226); “Save \nthe  Children”  says  that  it  has  helped  over  11,000  Flint  families  by  providing \nnutrient-rich food and early childhood development support, (id. ¶ 227); and the \nUniversity of Michigan’s Water Crisis: Community Impact Fund is, among other \nactivities,  analyzing  Flint’s  water  infrastructure  and  providing  free  lead \nscreening.15   \n42.  Celebrities  from  near  and  far  have  raised  awareness  and  financial \nsupport. Detroit Pistons owner Tom Gores pledged $10 million to Flint, Beyonce \nannounced plans for a Flint fund, and famous comedians have hosted shows in \nMichigan to benefit the “Flint Child Health and Development Fund.” (Ex. B ¶ \n228.) Other stars like Cher, Eminem, Mark Wahlberg, Big Sean, Pearl Jam, Jimmy \nFallon,  Matt  Damon,  Jack  White,  Mark  Ruffalo,  and  Michael  Moore,  Sandra \nBernhard, Magic Johnson, Madonna, Snoop Dogg, Puff Daddy, Rosie O’Donnell, \nand Seth Meyers have raised money and awareness for Flint. (Id. ¶¶ 229-30.)  \n43.  Moreover,  the  Detroit  Free  Press  has  run  countless  stories  like \n“STARS  USE  SOCIAL  MEDIA  TO  EXPRESS  OUTRAGE  OVER  FLINT,” \n“FLINT CRISIS ATTRACTS CELEBRITY CASH - AND SCAMMERS,” “TOP \nDIRECTORS,  PERFORMERS  TO  BE  IN  FLINT  ON  OSCAR  NIGHT,”  and \n“DON’T  FORGET  ABOUT  FLINT  NOW  THAT  CELEBRITIES  AND  TV \n                                                            \n15 https://www.umflint.edu/outreach/community-impact-fund  \n20 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 21 of 62    Pg ID 243\n \nCAMERAS  ARE  GONE,”  to  encourage  continued  support  for  Flint  and  its \nresidents. (Id. ¶¶ 229, 231-33.) \n44.  When  polled,  as  part  of  Dr.  Edelman’s  survey,  over  half  of  this \nCourt’s jury pool states that they have donated money or resources to help the \npeople  in  Flint  who  have  been  affected  by  the  water  “crisis.”  (See  Edelman \nDeclaration (Ex. A) ¶ 4, 45.) Specifically, Dr. Edelman identified that 55% of \nrespondents  reported  that  they  or  family  members  have  donated  money  or \nresources,  compared  to  53%  in  the  Grand  Rapids  jury  pool  and  20%  in  the \nMarquette jury pool. (Id. ¶ 105.) These community outreach figures are significant \nwhere  90%  of  survey  respondents  who  have  donated  resources  favored  the \nplaintiffs  in  these  lawsuits  and  were  more  likely  to  award  damages  to  punish \nDefendants. (Id.) Notably, “those who read the Detroit News, Detroit Free Press, \nand the Oakland Press were significantly more likely to donate resources than \nthose who read other newspapers.” (Id. ¶ 106.) \n45.  Defendants  (including  the  MDEQ  Defendants)  have  also  been  the \nsubject of numerous instances of community hostility. In Ann Arbor streets have \nbeen  littered  with  chalk  graffiti  expressing  negative  comments  toward  public \nofficials, the Governor has been heckled at Ann Arbor establishments, and there \nhave been several protests conducted outside of the Governor’s Main Street condo. \n(See Ex. B ¶¶ 234-36.) Indeed, just blocks away from this Court, perhaps near \nvenues where the Court’s jurors eat lunch, one can even find “wanted” posters \nseeking the arrest of Defendant Snyder. \n21 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 22 of 62    Pg ID 244\n \n46.  In Flint, such acts of community outrage over the water are common \nplace. Protests have been attended by crowds sometimes in the thousands hoisting \njugs of discolored water of unconfirmed origin and displaying inflammatory signs \ncalling  for  resignations,  arrests,  and  justice;  accusing  Defendants  of  poisoning \nchildren;  and  referencing  “murderers,”  “lab  rats,”  “dead  children,”  and  “lead-\ntainted water.” (Id. ¶¶ 158-59, 237-38.)  \n47.  Earlier this year, Defendant Snyder was loudly booed and heckled in \nFlint  when  he  spoke  to  about  1,000  students,  teachers,  and  residents  at \nNorthwestern High School. (Id. ¶ 239.) His family has been threatened. (Id. ¶ 240.) \nAnd, over 620,000 persons have signed a petition calling for him to be arrested. \n(Id. ¶ 241.) It is beyond debate that a mob mentality has formed.  \n48.   Such  community-wide  hostility,  however,  has  not  been  focused \nsolely on Defendant Snyder. Much of the outrage has been directed at the MDEQ \nDefendants, all of whom have been the recipient of a number of wrongly-aimed \npersonal attacks readily available for viewing by the jury pool. By way of limited \nexample, online comments following local articles on the Flint water crisis include: \n  Maybe it will be better to wait for the Feds to charge these criminals and \nlet them rot in a country club prison, but as long as they rot in prison is \nthe justice deserved. (Id. ¶ 189.)  \n  The people doing the tests and releasing results are the ones to blame \nhere, so yea, that makes sense. (Id. ¶ 191.)  \n  I  don’t  think  this  was  about  money.  This  is  about  lazy  government \nemployees not doing their jobs. (Id.)  \n  The  DEQ  and  governor  knew  of  the  corrosion  problems  when  GM \npresented the analysis of the water corroding its engine parts in October \nof 2014! (Id.) \n22 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 23 of 62    Pg ID 245\n \n  Stephen Busch currently on “suspension” ought to be under arrest. Mike \nPrysby—they are coming for you. Liane Shekter Smith, getting fired is \nthe  least  of  your  problems  .  .  .  Their  collective  lack  of  curiosity, \ndereliction and stonewalling will doom them and many others who were \ninvolved in this outrageous tragedy. (Id. ¶ 192.) \n  Busch  should  be  criminally  charged.  This  was  his  reaction  when \nannoyed [by] the efforts of Miguel Del Toral . . . “if he continues to \npersist, we may need Liane (Shekter Smith) or Director (Dan) Wyant to \nmake a call to EPA to help address his overreaches.” (Id.) \n  I think jail time is necessary for some of these folks. (Id.)  \n  The state should be forced to disband the entire DEQ Dept. They have \nproven to be worthless, and LIARS. Get rid of all of them. Talk about a \nwaste of tax money!! (Id.) \n  I agree, but the State DEQ was not only incompetent, they tried to hide \ndangerous lead levels communicated by the EPA and upper level EPA \nfolks gave them their blessing in their obfuscation. (Id.)  \n  Michael Prysby and Stephen Busch NEED TO BE FIRED!!! I have been \nsaying this for 18 months! Jim Sygo should be added to the list after this \narticle! All this proves is their clear lack of human decency from the \noutcry of people in writing! Citizens need to demand termination! It \nmakes me ill to know my tax paying dollars go to these very people who \npoisoned my family and every other person in Flint. (Id. ¶ 187.) \n  No Brad Wurfel, you and your colleagues lost the human element. You \nall are now going to have to live with the death, long-term suffering, and \nfinancial catastrophe which your arrogance, contempt, corruption, greed, \nignorance, incompetence, and willful neglect has caused and inflicted on \nthe very Taxpayers Citizens who paid your salary . . . For the rest of \nyour lives . . . . (Id. ¶ 242.) \nEMPIRICAL EVIDENCE OF JUROR PREJUDICE \n49.  Eastern District – Ann Arbor: The public opinion survey conducted \nby  Dr.  Edelman  in  the  Eastern  District’s  Ann  Arbor  Place  of  Holding  Court \nshowed significant recognition of both the Flint water crisis, and some of the more \nprejudicial publicity surrounding it. (See Edelman Declaration (Ex. A) ¶¶ 42-47.) \n23 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 24 of 62    Pg ID 246\n \nFor example, this past summer, recognition of the Flint water crisis was 95%, with \n71% of potential jurors aware of the civil lawsuits and 65% aware of the criminal \ncharges. (Id. ¶¶ 47, 100.) Of the seven news items included in the survey, the \nmedian number recognized among respondents from this Court’s jury pool was \nfive.  (Id.  ¶  60.)  Moreover,  40%  of  respondents  recognized  all  three  of  the \nfollowing  prejudicial  media  items:  criminal  charges,  child  lead  exposure,  and \nmisapplication of federal drinking water rules. (Id. ¶ 100.) Dr. Edelman opined that \nthese recognition rates “are some of the highest [he has] seen.” (Id. ¶ 47.)  \n50.  Among respondents familiar with the civil lawsuits, 83% believed \nthat “city and state public officials acted with reckless disregard for the public’s \nsafety by exposing them to high levels of lead in the drinking water.” (Id. ¶ 48.) \nAmong respondents unfamiliar with the civil lawsuits, those favoring the plaintiffs \nstayed level at 83%. (Id. ¶ 49.)16 Of respondents who were familiar with either the \nwater crisis or lawsuits, 74% believed that, “damages should be awarded in order \nto punish the city and state officials who are the defendants in these lawsuits.” (Id. \n¶  56.)  A  large  percentage  (55%)  of  respondents  reported  that  they  or  family \nmembers have donated money or resources to help Flint. (Id. ¶ 105.)  \n51.  According to Dr. Edelman, “[t]hese findings are extremely alarming \nand show that the burden of proof at the start of trial would be unfairly shifted to \nthe defendants, who would have to prove that they were not grossly negligent.” (Id. \n                                                            \n16 Among this group, 93% reported that defendants would have a difficult time \nconvincing them that they did not act with reckless disregard for the public’s \nsafety. (Id. ¶ 53.) \n24 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 25 of 62    Pg ID 247\n \n¶ 53.) In fact, he believes that the prejudice here “has reached levels so severe that \nit rivals some of the most notorious cases in American history, including what was \nseen in the Oklahoma City Bombing trials.” (Id. ¶ 3.) \n52.  Dr. Edelman further found that the “qualitative” comments from this \nCourt’s  jury  pool  “demonstrated  widespread  negative  opinions  unlikely  to  be \nameliorated through judicial admonition”:  \n  “The  evidence  that  we  have  seen  is  that  they  knew  all  about  it  and \nignored it for a long time.”  \n  “I think the evidence that I have heard proves there was knowledge of a \nproblem and officials did not act upon it.”  \n  “Because  I  think  from  what  I  read  that  they  did  act  with  reckless \ndisregard. I think it was more profit driven.”  \n  “I think it was for financial reasons they didn’t want to spend the money \nto fix the problem so they covered it up.  It would have stayed covered up \nif the pediatrician didn’t blow the whistle on the whole scandal.” \n  “They misled the people and lied to them. They were untruthful and the \nstate knew that the water was bad. The people that worked for the state of \nMichigan drank bottled water.  Not telling them the water was messed \nup. So, they knew about it beforehand.”  \n  “They  knew  prior  to  that  the  water  was  unsafe.  General  Motors  had \nhooked up to the Flint River and the water rusted their cars. That’s how \nthey should have known.” \n  “Because it has been proven they lied and misled. Governor Snyder came \nout and said it.” \n  “Because they poisoned people and children. There’s no grey area here.” \n(Id. ¶ 54.) \n53.  Based  on  these  survey  results,  Dr.  Edelman  opined  that  in  his \nexperience “[c]ase-specific attitudes such as these cannot just be simply cast aside \n25 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 26 of 62    Pg ID 248\n \nwith a judicial instruction, and are likely to put an undue burden on the defense \nthat is almost impossible to overcome.” (Id. ¶ 56).  \n54.  He further averred that: “[t]aken as a whole, the extensive and deep \nseeded prejudice found in the Ann Arbor jury pool represents the highest levels I \nhave seen . . . .” (Id. ¶ 46.)  \n55.  For those and other reasons stated in his declaration, Dr. Edelman \nrecommends that “it is within the interest of justice to transfer these cases outside \nof the Eastern District to a venue in a different media market.” (Id. ¶ 91.) \n56.  Western District – Southern Division: The public opinion survey \nconducted  by  Dr.  Edelman  in  the  Southern  Division  of  the  Western  District \nshowed significant recognition of the Flint water crisis, but less recognition of \nsome  of  the  more  prejudicial  publicity  surrounding  it.  (Id.  ¶  6.)  For  example, \nrecognition of the Flint water crisis was 99%, with 63% of potential jurors aware \nof the civil lawsuits and 56% aware of the criminal charges. (Id. ¶ 93, 100.) Of the \nseven news items included in the survey, the median number recognized among \nrespondents  in  the  Southern  Division  was  four.  (Id.  ¶  99.)  Similarly,  24%  of \nrespondents recognized all three of the following prejudicial media items: criminal \ncharges, child lead exposure, and misapplication of federal drinking water rules. \n(Id. ¶ 100.)  \n57.  Among respondents familiar with the civil litigation, 81% believed \nthat  Defendants  acted  with  reckless  disregard.  (Id.  ¶  94.)  Among  respondents \nunfamiliar with the civil lawsuits, those favoring the plaintiffs inched up to 82%. \n26 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 27 of 62    Pg ID 249\n \n(Id. ¶ 95.) A large percentage (53%) of respondents reported that they or family \nmembers have donated money or resources to help Flint. (Id. ¶ 105.)  \n58.  Based  on  these  responses,  Dr.  Edelman  opined  that  there  is  a \ndisturbing level of prejudice in the Western District’s Southern Division, and that \nthis case should be transferred to a venue outside of Michigan. (Id. ¶ 109.) \n59.  Western District – Northern Division: The public opinion survey \nconducted by Dr. Edelman in the Northern Division of the Western District also \nshowed significant recognition of the Flint water crisis, but less recognition of \nsome of the more prejudicial publicity surrounding it than in the other Michigan \nDistricts. (Id. ¶ 6.) For example, recognition of the Flint water crisis was 96%, but \nonly 56% of potential jurors were aware of the civil lawsuits and only 44% were \naware of the criminal charges. (Id. ¶¶ 93, 100.) Of the seven news items included \nin the survey, the median number recognized among respondents in the Northern \nDivision was three. (Id. ¶ 99.) Similarly, only 18% of respondents recognized all \nthree  of  the  following  prejudicial  media  items:  criminal  charges,  child  lead \nexposure, and misapplication of federal drinking water rules. (Id. ¶ 100.)  \n60.  Among respondents familiar with the civil litigation, 89% believed \nthat Defendants acted with reckless disregard. (Id. ¶ 94.) But among respondents \nunfamiliar with the civil lawsuits, those favoring the plaintiffs dropped to 74%. \n(Id. ¶ 94.) Only 20% of respondents reported that they or family members have \ndonated  money  or  resources  to  help  Flint.  (Id.  ¶  105.)  And,  only  10%  of \nrespondents felt that they had been impacted personally or knew someone who had \nbeen impacted personally by the Flint water crisis. (Id. ¶ 104.)  \n27 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 28 of 62    Pg ID 250\n \n61.  Based  on  these  responses,  Dr.  Edelman  opined  that  there  is  a \nconcerning level of prejudice in the Western District’s Northern Division, and that \nthis  case  should  be  transferred  to  a  venue  outside  of  Michigan.  (Id.  ¶  109.) \nHowever, because the jury pool in the Northern Division “is less knowledgeable \nabout prejudicial media reporting surrounding events in Flint, and less engaged in \nhelping  the  residents  there,”  Dr.  Edelman  opined  that  the  Northern  Division \n“represents the least prejudicial option available” in Michigan. (Id. ¶¶ 6, 109.) \nCONCLUSION \n62.  This saturation of adverse publicity and extreme community outrage \nhas resulted in the omnipresent view among this Court’s jury pool that Defendants \n(particularly  the  MDEQ  Defendants)  caused  and  are  liable  for  the  Flint  water \ncrisis. This proverbial bell cannot be un-rung. It is axiomatic that such extreme \nlevels of bias render the voir dire process ineffective. (Id. ¶¶ 66-91.) In fact, the \nsheer amount of adverse publicity and documented juror prejudice here exceeds \nthat found in numerous other federal cases where venue was transferred to protect \na defendant’s constitutional right to a fair trial and impartial jury.  \n63.  The MDEQ Defendants thus urge the Court to transfer this case to an \nout-of-state, metropolitan venue offering a jury pool substantially more likely to \nrender an unbiased decision based on admissible evidence procured at trial rather \nthan on their ties to the affected community, or on what they have already read, \nseen, or heard in local media accounts.  \n64.  Alternatively, the MDEQ Defendants ask the Court to transfer this \nmatter to the least prejudicial venue in this State; the Northern Division of the \n28 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 29 of 62    Pg ID 251\n \nUnited States District Court for the Western District of Michigan. Two related \ncases are already pending in the Southern Division of the Western District. See \nNappier v. Snyder, Case No. 1:16-cv-00636 (W.D. Mich.); Anderson v. Snyder, \nCase No. 1:16-cv-00874 (W.D. Mich.). \n65.  Pursuant  to  E.D.  Mich.  L.R.  7.1(a),  counsel  for  the  MDEQ \nDefendants explained the nature of this motion to change venue, its legal basis, and \nrequested, but did not obtain, concurrence from Plaintiffs’ counsel via e-mail on \nOctober  25,  2016.  On  October  26,  2016,  counsel  for  Defendant  Lockwood, \nAndrews and Newnam, Inc. concurred in the relief sought. On October 24 and \nOctober 26, 2016, the remaining Defendants were consulted but either have not \nresponded to the MDEQ’s request for concurrence or did not concur or with the \nrelief sought in this Motion for Change of Venue. \n66.  In  support  of  this  motion,  the  MDEQ  Defendants  rely  on  their \ncontemporaneously filed Brief in Support of Motion for Change of Venue and the \nExhibits attached thereto, including the Declaration of Dr. Bryan Edelman. \nWHEREFORE, MDEQ Defendants respectfully request that this Honorable \nCourt: (a) grant their Motion to Change Venue; (b) transfer this case to either an \nout-of-state venue where they are more likely to receive a fair trial or, alternatively, \nto  the  Northern  Division  of  the  United  States  District  Court  for  the  Western \nDistrict of Michigan; and (c) award them any different or further relief this Court \ndeems equitable and just. \n \n \n29 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 30 of 62    Pg ID 252\n \n \n \n \nDated:  October 27, 2016              Respectfully submitted, \nFoster, Swift, Collins & Smith, P.C.

INTRODUCTION \nHow can fallible men and women reach a disinterested verdict based \nexclusively on what they heard in court when, before they entered the \njury box, their minds were saturated by press and radio for months \npreceding by matter designed to establish the guilt of the accused. A \nconviction so secured obviously constitutes a denial of due process of \nlaw in its most rudimentary conception.17 \nThe  overwhelming  quantity  and  unique  quality  of  the  adverse  publicity \npervading this matter has made it nearly impossible for the Defendants, especially \nthose  currently  or  formerly  employed  by  the  Michigan  Department  of \nEnvironmental  Quality  (“MDEQ  Defendants”),  to  receive  a  fair  trial  by  an \nimpartial jury in this Judicial District and potentially the State of Michigan. Local \nmedia’s  constant  and  unyielding  reporting  of  the  Flint  water  “crisis”  has  been \nprolific,  incendiary,  fraught  with  inaccuracies,  and  heavily  slanted  against  the \nMDEQ Defendants. Over the last year, few days have gone by without this Court’s \njury pool hearing that the residents of Flint and their children were “poisoned” with \n“lead”  and  “bacteria”  tainted  water  due  to  the  MDEQ  Defendants’  alleged \n“incompetence,”  “arrogance,”  “callous  disregard,”  “criminal  misconduct,”  and \neven “racism.”18   \nTo potential jurors, the constant influx and repetition of local media stories \npainting  Defendants  (particularly  the  MDEQ  Defendants)  as  indifferent \n                                                            \n17 Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U.S. 717, 729-30; 81 S. Ct. 1639; 6 L. Ed. 2d 751 (1961) \n(Frankfurter, J., concurring) (emphasis added). \n18  This  bombardment  of  adverse  publicity  has  come  from  every  direction \n(including  radio,  newspaper,  television,  online  and  social  media,  and  public \nrallies), and is far too great in volume to capture here. An appendix summarizing \nless than 10% of this prejudicial news coverage is attached as Exhibit B.  \n1 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 37 of 62    Pg ID 259\n \nbureaucrats, criminals, and racists sounds and feels like evidence. It is not. The \nrepeated and seemingly authoritative statements from politicians, state prosecutors, \nprofessors,  and  plaintiffs’  attorneys  rebuking  and  calling  for  justice  from \nDefendants (particularly the MDEQ Defendants) sounds and feels like evidence.   \nIt  is  not.  The  adverse  findings  and  recommendations  of  politically-appointed \ninvestigative commissions casting blame on Defendants (particularly the MDEQ \nDefendants) sounds and feels like evidence. It is not. Such stories, statements, and \nfindings are silent with respect to the plethora of readily available exculpatory \nevidence and are not likely admissible. \nBut the sensationalism has not been lost on state prosecutors and plaintiffs’ \nattorneys who have taken full advantage of the local media’s willingness to engage \nin mob journalism. Before commending the local media for doing a “great job” \nholding the MDEQ Defendants “accountable” and actually stating that the media is \npart of his “investigation team,” state prosecutor, Todd Flood, told the jury pool \nthat: “There isn’t a case that has jarred my soul more than this for the lack of \ncaring, the lack of compassion, the lack of understanding that has affected these \ncitizens here in Flint.” (Id. ¶ 199.)19 Worse yet, on September 20, 2016, Michael \nPitt, lead counsel for Plaintiffs in the Mays v. Snyder case, Case No. 5:15-cv-\n14002,  where  this  motion  was  originally  filed,  gave  a  highly  inflammatory \n                                                            \n19  Ingham  County  Prosecutor  and  Democratic  gubernatorial  hopeful,  Gretchen \nWhitmer, promptly questioned these tactics, explaining that: “Prosecutors aren’t \nsupposed to be doing big press conferences and revealing strategy and making \naccusations in the press,” because, inter alia, such antics “can taint a potential \njury pool.” (Id. ¶ 246.) \n2 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 38 of 62    Pg ID 260\n \ninterview on Michigan Radio’s show “Stateside” where he described the MDEQ \nDefendants as “criminals” and “racists,” and then accused them of conducting an \n“experiment”  with  “poisonous”  water  on  the  “African  American  population  in \nFlint.” (See Pitt Interview Transcript, attached as Exhibit C.)  \nNot surprisingly, communities across the State (especially those making up \nthis  Judicial  District)  have  exhibited  strong  emotional  reactions.  According  to \npublic opinion surveys conducted by Dr. Bryan Edelman, a leading expert in the \nfield, over half of this Court’s jury pool claims to have donated money or resources \nto help Flint. (See Edelman Declaration (Ex. A), ¶¶ 4, 45, 105.) Many others have \nresorted to displays of hostility, such as protests, heckling, graffiti, and absurd \nonline  comments  wrongly  directed  toward  the  MDEQ  Defendants.  Indeed,  Dr. \nEdelman’s media analyses and public opinion surveys demonstrate that, without a \nsingle constitutional due process safeguard in place, the MDEQ Defendants have \nalready  been  publically  charged  and  tried  by  the  local  media’s  investigative \nreporting and convicted by a supermajority of the jury pool. \nDr. Edelman found that the Flint water crisis is one of the most heavily and \nnegatively publicized events in the Country. (Id. ¶¶ 33-34.) His survey revealed \nthat among potential jurors aware of the events in Flint: (a) 96% had read, seen, or \nheard that children in Flint had been exposed to high levels of lead; (b) 71% had \nread, seen, or heard about the civil lawsuits; and (c) 65% had read, seen, or heard \nabout the criminal charges. (Id. ¶¶ 47, 60, 61.) This empirical data shows that the \n“crisis” has “become seared in the public’s consciousness” and, as the number of \n3 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 39 of 62    Pg ID 261\n \nprejudicial articles grow, so does the prejudice within this Court’s jury pool. (Id. ¶¶ \n3, 16-31, 34.) \nWith  respect  to  the  “entrenched”  bias  saturating  the  community,  Dr. \nEdelman’s survey showed that among potential jurors aware of either the events in \nFlint  and/or  the  lawsuits:  83%  already  favor  plaintiffs  and  believe  that  public \nofficials acted with reckless disregard with 72% stating that Defendants would \nhave a “difficult time” convincing them otherwise; and 74% already believe that \ndamages should be awarded to punish the public officials named in the lawsuits. \n(Id.  ¶¶  3,  48-50,  57.)  These  survey  results  are  “extremely  alarming”  and \ndemonstrate that the burden of proof at trial would be “unfairly shifted to the \ndefendants, who would have to prove that they were not grossly negligent,” a “near \nimpossible hurdle to overcome.” (Id. ¶ 53.) \nTo  protect  Defendants’  constitutional  right  to  a  fair  trial,  Dr.  Edelman \nrecommends,  and  the  MDEQ  Defendants  request,  that  the  Court  follow  the \nnumerous federal court decisions cited below and exercise its general supervisory \npower to transfer this case to a venue untainted by the level of adverse publicity \nand indignation in this District and State. Alternatively, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § \n1404(a), the Court should transfer venue to the Northern Division of the United \nStates District Court for the Western District because it is the least prejudicial \nvenue in the State of Michigan. (Id. ¶¶ 6, 109, 114.)20  \n                                                            \n20 MDEQ Defendants are currently defending two related federal cases in the \nWestern District’s Southern Division. See Nappier v. Snyder, Case No. 1:16-cv-\n00636 (W.D. Mich.); Anderson v. Snyder, Case No. 1:16-cv-00874 (W.D. Mich.). \n4 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 40 of 62    Pg ID 262\n \nThe MDEQ Defendants further request that the Court take action now. As \nthe number of incendiary and biased news stories in Michigan continue to mount \ndaily, so too does the prejudice level among potential jurors located throughout \nmost of the State. These jurors are not likely to forget what they have read, seen, or \nheard. Waiting until the eve of trial, conducting what all evidence in hand now \nshows would result in a failed attempt to assemble a fair and impartial jury, and \nonly  then  transferring  this  matter  to  a  less  prejudice  venue,  will  only  further \nprejudice the MDEQ Defendants and deprive the ultimate transferee court of the \nability to manage the case leading up to and during trial.     \nII.  ARGUMENT \nA.  A  Change  of  Venue  is  Necessary  to  Protect  Defendants’ \nConstitutional Right to a Fair Trial by an Impartial Jury.    \n1.  The  United  States  Constitution  Guarantees  Civil \nDefendants a Fair Trial by an Impartial Jury. \nThe United States Constitution, through the due process clause of the Fifth \nAmendment  and  the  right  to  a  jury  trial  enshrined  in  the  Sixth  and  Seventh \nAmendments, requires federal courts to give every defendant a fair trial whether in \nthe criminal or civil arena. See, e.g., Haley v. Blue Ridge Transfer Co., 802 F.2d \n1532, 1535 (4th Cir. 1986) (“It is fundamental that every litigant who is entitled to \ntrial by jury is entitled to an impartial jury, free to the furthest extent practicable \nfrom extraneous influences that may subvert the fact-finding process”); Barnes v. \nCentury Aluminum Co., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66054, at *12 (D.V.I. May 9, \n2013) (unpublished) (“[T]he constitutional imperative for a fair and impartial trial \nis equally applicable to civil actions as well as criminal actions”) (Exhibit L).  \n5 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 41 of 62    Pg ID 263\n \nThus,  even  though  this  is  a  civil  case,  the  MDEQ  Defendants  are \nconstitutionally entitled to an impartial jury. See, e.g., McCoy v. Goldston, 652 \nF.2d 654, 657 (6th Cir. 1981) (“The right to an impartial jury in civil cases is \ninherent in the Seventh Amendment’s preservation of a ‘right to trial by jury’ and \nthe Fifth Amendment’s guarantee that ‘no person shall be denied of life, liberty or \nproperty without due process of law’”); Skaggs v. Otis Elevator Co., 164 F.3d 511, \n514-15 (10th Cir. 1998) (“[T]he right to a jury trial in a civil case would be illusory \nunless it encompassed the right to an impartial jury”).21 \n2.  Federal Courts Must Safeguard Defendants’ Right to a Fair \nTrial by an Impartial Jury. \nThe  Sixth  Circuit  has  held  that  “[i]f  pretrial  publicity  jeopardizes  a \ndefendant’s right to a fair trial by an impartial jury, the trial court should grant the \ndefendant a change in venue.” Foley v. Parker, 488 F.3d 377, 387 (6th Cir. 2007) \n(citation omitted); see also Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333, 363; 86 S. Ct. \n1507 (1966) (venue should be changed “where there is a reasonable likelihood that \nprejudicial news prior to trial will prevent a fair trial”). Where a motion to change \nvenue is brought prior to any attempt to empanel an impartial jury, it is adjudicated \nunder the presumed-prejudice standard. Ritchie v. Rogers, 313 F.3d 948, 952 (6th \nCir. 2002) (citing Murphy v. Florida, 421 U.S. 794, 798; 95 S. Ct. 2031 (1975)). \n                                                            \n21 Even though the issue in Skaggs was governed by the Seventh Amendment, the \nTenth Circuit found that “the reasoning of the Sixth Amendment cases concerning \njuror bias [was] germane to [its] analysis . . . .” 164 F.3d at 515 n.2. Accordingly, \nbecause civil and criminal defendants are both constitutionally entitled to a fair \ntrial by an impartial jury, both civil and criminal cases addressing due process \nissues in the context of venue transfers are applicable here. \n6 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 42 of 62    Pg ID 264\n \nUnder this standard, courts presume prejudice where adverse publicity causes a \n“wave of public passion” reaching levels where “jurors’ claims that they can be \nimpartial should not be believed.” Patton v. Yount, 467 U.S. 1025, 1031; 104 S. Ct. \n2885 (1984). Such findings of presumed prejudice are rare. DeLisle v. Rivers, 161 \nF.3d 370, 382 (6th Cir. 1998) (citation omitted).  \nIn  addition  to  this  constitutional  standard,  federal  courts  have  broad \nsupervisory authority under which a change of venue may be granted. Marshall v. \nUnited States, 360 U.S. 310, 312; 79 S. Ct. 1171 (1959) (federal courts have “a \nlarge discretion in ruling on the issue of prejudice resulting from the reading by \njurors of news articles concerning the trial”). Cases construing this supervisory \nauthority suggest that the threshold for unacceptable publicity triggering a change \nin  venue  may  well  be  lower  than  under  the  constitutional  presumed-prejudice \nstandard described above. See, e.g., United States v. Williams, 568 F.2d 464, 469 \n(5th Cir. 1978) (“It is plain that the Marshall rule is considerably broader than the \nconstitutional standard and provides more protection against prejudice”); United \nStates v. Tokars, 839 F. Supp. 1578, 1581 (N.D. Ga. 1993) (finding that motions to \nchange venue should be reviewed under the constitutional standard of Murphy and \nalso under the supervisory standard of Marshall ).22 Both standards are met here. \n                                                            \n22 See also Skilling v. United States, 561 U.S. 358, 446 n.9; 130 S. Ct. 2896 (2010) \n(Sotomayor, J., dissenting in part) (stating that the Court’s supervisory powers \nconfer “more latitude” to set standards for the conduct of trials in federal courts \nthan in state courts); Rideau v. Louisiana, 373 U.S. 723, 729; 83 S. Ct. 1417 (1963) \n(Clark, J., dissenting) (noting that “there is a very significant difference between \nmatters within the scope of our supervisory power and matters which reach the \nlevel of constitutional dimension”).\n \n7 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 43 of 62    Pg ID 265\n \n3.  The  Adverse  Publicity  Pervading  the  State  Jeopardizes \nDefendants’ Right to a Fair Trial by an Impartial Jury. \na.  The  Media  Analyses  and  Public  Opinion  Surveys \nShow that a Change of Venue is Needed. \n“Statistical evidence or the results of opinion polls are often used to support \na pre voir dire request for transfer.” N. Ind. Pub. Serv. Co. v. Envirotech Corp., 566 \nF. Supp. 362, 365 (N.D. Ind. 1983) (citing cases).23 In Tokars, 839 F. Supp. at \n1581, for example, the court found that “[d]efendants’ claims of pervasiveness of \npublicity and prejudicial effect of publicity [were] aided by [public opinion] survey \nresults” which showed that 69% of respondents heard or read “a great deal” about \nthe victim’s murder and 66% had formed an opinion that the defendant was guilty \nof the murder. Id. at 1584. Based on these polling results and the “negative” nature \nof the publicity, the court concluded that “a sufficient presumption of prejudice \nexists to constitutionally mandate a change of venue.” Id. (emphasis added). \nBy way of further example, in United States v. Sablan, 2014 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 175682, at *3-6 (E.D. Cal. Dec. 19, 2014) (unpublished) (Exhibit M), the \ndistrict court ordered a change of venue based on: (a) news analyses showing \n“significant media coverage throughout the Fresno Division area from which the \njury . . . would be drawn”; and (b) an opinion survey demonstrating that “60 \npercent  of  the  venire  has  a  source  of  bias  against  Defendant  .  .  .  .”  See  also \nWilliams  v.  Superior  Ct.,  34  Cal.  3d  584,  590  (1983)  (directing  trial  court  to \n                                                            \n23 See also United States v. Gordon, 380 F. Supp. 2d 356, 365 (D. Del. 2005) \n(change of venue required where polls showed that “almost everyone in [venue] \nheard about the case, and a substantial majority have already formed opinions \nabout it”). \n8 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 44 of 62    Pg ID 266\n \ntransfer venue where only “one out of five [potential jurors] would not be able to \ngive defendant a fair trial”); People v. Boss, 261 A.D.2d 1, 6 (N.Y. App. Div. 1st \nDep’t 1999) (change of venue required where 41% of potential jurors said the \npolice were guilty of shooting the victim and 81% said there was no possible \njustification for the number of shots fired); Commonwealth v. Cohen, 489 Pa. 167, \n187 (1980) (change of venue required where “nearly two-thirds of those jurors \nquestioned had an opinion on guilt”). \nHere, media analyses and opinion surveys establish that the Court’s jury \npool  has  been  so  saturated  with  inflammatory  publicity  that  to  protect  the \nDefendants’ due process rights, the Court should transfer this case to another venue \nlocated in a different media market. (Ex. A ¶¶ 3-5, 91, 113.) First, the Westlaw \n“News” search of the principal newspapers in the Eastern District of Michigan for \narticles pertaining to the “Flint water crisis” produced an astounding number of \nresults: (a) Detroit Free Press: 1,786 articles, (Exhibit D ); (b) Flint Journal: \n1,368 articles, (Exhibit E ); and (c) Detroit News: 567 articles, (Exhibit F).24 This \nunprecedented number of articles is 42 times higher than the median number of \narticles published in 52 cases where a change of venue was granted. Likely as a \n                                                            \n24 Similarly, Dr. Edelman’s media analysis of one publication within the Eastern \nDistrict  (i.e.,  the  Detroit  Free  Press),  confirmed  that  this  case  has  “generated \nmassive coverage, which has actually increased with the passage of time.” (See \nEdelman Declaration (Ex. A) ¶¶ 31-33.) Dr. Edelman identified a total of 718 \narticles focused on this matter, a number over eight times higher than the median \nnumber of news articles (i.e., 88.5) present in 52 cases where a change of venue \nwas granted. (Id. ¶ 33.) An archive of the 718 Detroit Free Press articles identified \nby Dr. Edelman is attached as Exhibit G. \n9 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 45 of 62    Pg ID 267\n \nresult,  Dr.  Edelman’s  public  opinion  survey  of  potential  jurors  in  this  District \nconfirmed that: (a) 95% have read, seen, or heard about the water situation in \nFlint; (b) 71% have read, seen, or heard about the civil lawsuits; and (c) 65% have \nread, seen, or heard about the criminal charges. (Id. ¶¶ 47, 60-61.)  \nThus, by way of limited example, the juror recognition of this case: (a) rivals \nthat in People v. Taylor, 113 Ill. App. 3d 467, 470 (1983), where the Illinois Court \nof Appeals found that “in large metropolitan area[s],” public polling showing that \n“98% of 382 people polled had heard of the case” and that “89% stated they had \nheard of it many times . . . illustrate[s] the pervasive effect of saturation news \ncoverage,” and (b) exceeds that in Daniels v. Woodford, 428 F.3d 1181, 1211 (9th \nCir. 2005), where 87% of the jury pool recognized the case from media coverage. \nSecond, it cannot fairly be denied that the scores of articles reporting on the \nFlint  water  crisis  have  been  and  will  continue  to  be  highly  prejudicial  to  the \nMDEQ  Defendants.  According  to  Dr.  Edelman,  “the  nature  of  coverage \nsurrounding  this  case  incorporates  the  types  of  sensational  and  prejudicial \nreporting  that  can  captivate  the  public’s  attention,  generate  anger,  and  lead  to \nwidespread bias in the jury pool.”  (Id. ¶ 41.) In the 718 articles he analyzed, the \nDetroit Free Press repeatedly described the matters at issue here in hyperbolic and \nhighly prejudicial terms. (Id. ¶¶ 35-38.) Moreover, many of these articles stated \nthat government officials knew about problems with the drinking water, failed to \ntake basic protective measures, and then covered up what they knew. (Id. ¶ 39.)  \nThird, Dr. Edelman’s public opinion survey confirmed that an overwhelming \nsupermajority of this Court’s jury pool already favor plaintiffs, already believe the \n10 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 46 of 62    Pg ID 268\n \nMDEQ Defendants acted with reckless disregard for public safety, already would \nhave a difficult time being convinced otherwise, and already are inclined to award \ndamages  to  punish  the  MDEQ  Defendants.  (Id.  ¶¶  42-66.)  This  finding  was \nbolstered  by  the  potential  jurors’  “qualitative”  comments  demonstrating  an \nengrained prejudice held against the MDEQ Defendants. (Id. ¶ 55.) Based on this \nempirical data, Dr. Edelman stated that “the deep seeded prejudice found in the . . . \njury pool represents the highest levels I have seen” and opined that if the case is \nnot transferred “the burden of proof at the start of trial would be unfairly shifted to \nthe defendants, who would have to prove that they were not grossly negligent.” (Id. \n¶¶ 46, 53.)  \nBecause the prejudice levels tainting this Court’s jury pool are significantly \nhigher than the levels found in Tokars, Sablan, Williams, and Boss, the Court here \nshould also transfer venue to protect the Defendants’ constitutional right to a fair \nand impartial trial. As the Supreme Court long-ago instructed, “it is not requiring \ntoo much that [defendant] be tried . . . by a jury other than one in which two-thirds \nof the members admit, before hearing any testimony, to possessing a belief in \n[defendant’s] guilt.” Irvin, 366 U.S. at 728. \nb.  Local Media’s Repeated Portrayal of Defendants’ \nStatements as “Admissions” of Liability Requires a \nChange of Venue.  \nWhen a defendant’s confession or admission of liability is featured in news \nmedia  coverage,  “a  change  of  venue  motion  should  be  granted  whenever \nrequested” because “the voir dire process cannot cure the effect of a ‘confession’ \n11 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 47 of 62    Pg ID 269\n \nwhich has been given news media coverage.” Oliver v. State, 250 So. 2d 888, 890 \n(Fla.  1971);  see  also  Rideau,  373  U.S.  at  724-26  (change  of  venue  based  on \ntelevised confession); Neb. Press Ass’n v. Stuart, 423 U.S. 1327, 1333; 96 S. Ct. \n251 (1975) (“A prospective juror who has read or heard of the confession . . . \nrepeatedly in the news may . . . be unable to form an independent judgment as to \nguilt or innocence”). The publications of purported confessions or admissions is \none of the few contexts “in which the risk that the jury will not, or cannot, follow \ninstructions is so great, and the consequences of failure so vital to the defendant, \nthat the practical and human limitations of the jury system cannot be ignored.” \nBruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 135; 88 S. Ct. 1620 (1968). \nIn this case, the local media has repeatedly ran stories characterizing the \ninadmissible  statements,  resignations,  and  apologies  of  the  Defendants  --  as \nadmissions of liability and wrongdoing. The jury pool has been saturated with \nreports that: (a) Defendant Snyder apologized for what he has since characterized \nas the “systematic failures” of “career bureaucrats” at the MDEQ; (b) Defendant \nWyant  resigned,  apologized,  and  acknowledged  that  “mistakes”  were  made  by \nMDEQ;  and  (c)  Defendant  Wurfel  resigned,  acknowledged  mistakes,  and  then \nissued apologies to the people of Flint.25 Because the mountain of adverse publicity \n                                                            \n25 This is in addition to a litany of seemingly authoritative statements and reports \nplacing blame on the MDEQ Defendants. See United States v. Moody, 762 F. \nSupp. 1485, 1488 (N.D. Ga. 1991) (publicized observations of guilt by FBI agent \njustified a change of venue); State v. Thompson, 266 Minn. 385, 388 (1963) (“The \nvice of the publicity given this case is not in printing or disseminating factual news \nbut in printing and broadcasting what purports to be the opinions of people who are \nsupposed to know the facts”). \n12 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 48 of 62    Pg ID 270\n \nin this case not only depicts the MDEQ Defendants as responsible for the “crisis,” \nbut also portrays them as having admitted responsibility, this matter is analogous to \ncases where even brief publications of criminal confessions necessitated venue \nchanges. For this reason, alone, a change of venue is constitutionally required. \nc.  The Politicization of This Matter Requires a Change \nof Venue. \n  “[L]egal  trials  are  not  like  elections,  to  be  won  through  the  use  of  the \nmeeting-hall, the radio, and the newspaper.” Sheppard, 384 U.S. at 350. “Political \nfactors have no place in a criminal proceeding, and when they are likely to appear  \n. . . they constitute an independent reason for a venue change.” Maine v. Superior \nCt., 68 Cal. 2d 375, 387 (1968); see also Powell v. Superior Ct., 232 Cal. App. 3d \n785 (1991) (change of  venue compelled by “the high level of political turmoil and \ncontroversy” surrounding the Rodney King arrest).26  \nAs  more  thoroughly  discussed  in  the  Motion,  the  politicization  found  in \nthese cases, where courts were constrained to transfer venue, pales in comparison \nto the politicization of the Flint water “crisis.” At every level of government, the \nFlint water crisis has been marked by declarations of emergency, disputes over \npublic aid packages, raucous congressional hearings, fault-allocating investigative \n                                                            \n26See also Caldwell v. State, 164 Tenn. 325, 332 (1932) (change of venue required \n \ndue to “very great excitement and public interest protracted by political agitation \nand its attendant publicity”); Pope v. State, 126 Tex. Crim. 35, 38 (1934) change of \nvenue  required  where  defendant’s  “official  conduct  had  become  a  factor  in \npolitical campaigns”); Smith v. Superior Ct., 276 Cal. App. 2d 145, 146-49 (1969) \n(change of venue required where “investigative journalism” of bribery allegations \nsaturated the community and became “a cause celebre in local politics”).\n \n13 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 49 of 62    Pg ID 271\n \ncommissions, and remarkably uninformed finger-pointing from both sides of the \npolitical  aisle,  including  presidential  and  gubernatorial  contenders,  federal  and \nstate legislators, and local officials.27 Even more troubling is that the lowness of \nthe political discourse largely concentrates on the allocation of blame (much of it \nmistakenly  toward  the  MDEQ  Defendants),  and  that  all  of  it  has  been  highly \npublicized by the local media. \nFurthermore, the well-publicized activities of several authoritative-sounding \ncommittees and commissions in Michigan have been prejudicial to the MDEQ \nDefendants.28 In particular, the Flint Water Advisory Task Force recently released \na final report concluding that: (a) the MDEQ was primarily to blame for the Flint \nwater situation, (b) MDEQ officials were “belligerent” and “intransigent,” and (c) \nthe  situation  amounted  to  environmental  racism.  (Exhibit  K.)  The  report,  of \ncourse,  received  enormous  local  media  attention,29  as  well  as  elation  from \nplaintiffs’ attorneys, who attached it as an exhibit to their complaints. (See Dkt. \nNo. 111-2.) For this reason, alone, venue should be transferred.        \nd.

Ebens,  654  F.  Supp.  144,  146  (E.D.  Mich.  1987).  The  Ebens  Court  was \n“compelled” to transfer venue where “the leadership of this community,” including \nthe  Attorney  General,  Detroit  City  Council,  Mayor  of  Highland  Park,  and  a \nplethora of civil rights groups, had been “quoted by the news media uniformly to \nthe effect that the defendant must be punished.” The Court explained that:  \nFactors such as the comment and castigation of public figures, the \nintensity and long duration of the publicity [], its inflammatory tone \nand  content,  and  the  continually  repeated  factual  recitations,  all \nmilitate toward the conclusion that a change of venue from the State \nof Michigan and the northern Ohio area must be granted.” [Id.] \n                                                            \n30 See also United State v.

As set forth more fully in the Motion, \nthe widespread community support for the residents of Flint coupled with well-\ndocumented and visceral hostility directed toward the MDEQ Defendants by the \nlocal politicians, community leaders, residents, and civil rights groups equals and, \nin  many  ways,  exceeds  that  present  in  Ebens,  James,  Boss,  Coleman,  and \nWoodford. The massive public and private humanitarian effort is well documented. \n(Ex. B ¶¶ 226-33.) Over half of this Court’s jury pool states that they have donated \nmoney or resources to help Flint residents. (Ex. A ¶¶ 4, 45, 106.)  \nAdditionally,  a  mob  mentality  has  formed.  Ann  Arbor  streets  have  been \nlittered with “wanted posters” and “graffiti” expressing negative comments toward \nstate officials, the Governor has been heckled at Ann Arbor establishments, and \nthere have been several protests just blocks from the Courthouse. (See Ex. B ¶¶ \n234-36, 239-40.) Such acts of community outrage are also common place in Flint. \nProtests have been attended by crowds in the thousands hoisting jugs of discolored \nwater  and  displaying  inflammatory  signs  calling  for  resignations,  arrests,  and \njustice. (Id. ¶¶ 158-59, 237-38, 241.) Much of the outrage has been directed at the \nMDEQ Defendants who have been the subject of shameful and wrongly-aimed \npersonal attacks in the online comments following local news articles. (Id. ¶¶ 187-\n93, 242.) For these reasons, venue should be transferred. \n \n \n16 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 52 of 62    Pg ID 274\n \n4.  Juror  Prejudice  Across  Michigan  is  so  Pervasive  and \nEntrenched  that  Transfer  to  an  Out-Of-State  Venue  is \nRequired. \nIn some instances, adverse publicity may be so inflammatory and pervasive \nacross an entire state that due process necessitates transfer of a case to an out-of-\nstate venue. See, e.g., Tokars, 839 F. Supp. at 1581-82 (“local newspaper articles \nand local television reports literally have numbered in the thousands”); United \nStates  v.  Abrahams,  453  F.  Supp.  749,  751  (D.  Mass.  1978)  (media  branded \ndefendant as  a “con man” and “swindler”); United States v. Mazzei, 400 F. Supp. \n17, 20 (W.D. Pa. 1975) (statewide perception that state senator violated the public \ntrust);  United  States  v.  Marcello,  280  F.  Supp.  510,  515-18  (E.D.  La.  1968) \n(adverse publicity not likely read with as much interest by citizens of other states). \nOne prominent example of an out-of-state transfer occurred in the Oklahoma \nBombing case of United States v. McVeigh, 918 F. Supp. 1467, 1469 (W.D. Okla. \n1996).  The  court  summarily  determined  that  an  impartial  jury  could  not  be \nempaneled  in  the  Western  District  of  Oklahoma  where  and  thus  weighed  the \npropriety of transferring venue out of state. Id. at 1470-72. It found that while the \nnational coverage of the bombing was initially intense, as time passed, “differences \ndeveloped  in  both  the  volume  and  focus  of  the  media  coverage  in  Oklahoma \ncompared  with  local  coverage  outside  of  Oklahoma  .  .  .  .”  Id.  at  1471.  “The \nOklahoma coverage was more personal, providing individual stories of grief and \nrecovery,” and “Oklahomans [were] united as a family.” Id. It also found that the \nadverse publicity was more frequent in Oklahoma. Id. at 1473.  \n17 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 53 of 62    Pg ID 275\n \nIn transferring the case to the United States District Court for the District of \nColorado, the court concluded “that there is so great a prejudice against these two \ndefendants in the State of Oklahoma that they cannot obtain a fair and impartial \ntrial at any place fixed by law for holding court.” Id. at 1474. In so holding, the \ncourt emphasized that defendant’s constitutional right to an impartial jury under \nthe  Sixth  Amendment  and  the  fundamental  fairness  requirement  of  the  Fifth \nAmendment Due Process clause overrode “the place of trial provisions in both \nArticle III and the Sixth Amendment.” Id. at 1469. \nIn this case, Dr. Edelman has, in fact, opined that the prejudice infecting this \nCourt’s jury pool is unacceptable and on par with that which necessitated a change \nof venue in McVeigh. (Ex. A ¶ 3.) In the Oklahoma City Bombing cases 99% of \npotential jurors were aware of the bombings and 83% of potential jurors were \nbiased against defendants. In this case, 95% of this Court’s jury pool is aware of \nthe water situation in Flint and that 83% of this Court’s jury pool is biased against \nDefendants. (Id. ¶¶ 47, 50.) The numbers are no better in Grand Rapids where \n99% of potential jurors are aware of the water situation in Flint and that 81% of \npotential jurors are biased against Defendants. (Id. ¶¶ 93-94.) \nAlso, like in McVeigh, where the court was constrained to order an out-of-\nstate venue because “Oklahomans [were] united as a family with a spirit unique to \nthe state,” Dr. Edelman’s survey here shows that Michiganders (especially in the \nlower peninsula) have united as a family to rally around the residents of Flint. (Id. \n¶¶  4,  105).    The  undeniable  fact  is  that  this  matter  has  commanded  a  strong \n18 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 54 of 62    Pg ID 276\n \nfollowing of Michigan residents because the events at issue occurred in Michigan, \naffected Michigan residents, and were allegedly caused by Michigan officials.  \nAccordingly,  protection  of  Defendants’  due  process  rights  demands  that \nthese matters be transferred to an out-of-state venue. Selection of a less prejudicial \nvenue is left to the Court’s discretion and typically entails review of metropolitan \nareas with non-stop flight service, adequate community resources, and available \nfederal court buildings. See, e.g., Abrahams, 453 F. Supp. at 753-54; Moody, 762 \nF. Supp. at 1490-91; McVeigh, 918 F. Supp. at 1474. \n5.  The Court Should Not Defer Transfer of Venue. \nThe appropriate time for the transfer is now. There exists no good reason \nvoir dire thousands of potential jurors in the hope of being able to cobble together \nan  impartial  jury.  Numerous  courts  have  expressed  skepticism  about  jurors’ \nassurances of impartiality in the face of vitriolic publicity. See, e.g., Irvin, 366 U.S. \nat 728 (“Where so many, so many times, admitted prejudice, such a statement of \nimpartiality can be given little weight”); Goins v. McKeen, 605 F.2d 947, 953-54 \n(6th  Cir.  1979)  (“The  effect  of  exposure  to  extrajudicial  reports  on  a  juror’s \ndeliberations  may  be  substantial  even  though  it  is  not  perceived  by  the  juror \nhimself, and a juror’s good faith cannot counter this effect”); Sablan, 2014 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 175682, at *6-7 (finding “little assurance that even the most rigorous \n[voir dire] procedures would mitigate the apparently legitimate specter of bias or \n19 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 55 of 62    Pg ID 277\n \nprejudice to the process of a fair trial” where polls showed “actual bias in more \nthan half the potential jury pool”).31  \nIn this case, there is more juror prejudice than in Irvin, Goins, and Sablan. \nOver a supermajority of this Court’s jury pool already favor plaintiffs, believe that \nDefendants acted with reckless disregard for the public’s safety, and want to award \ndamage to punish Defendants. (Ex. A ¶¶ 48, 50, 57.) As explained by Dr. Edelman, \n“where there is massive media coverage and pervasive prejudice within the jury \npool, voir dire does not serve as a reliable prophylactic measure for protecting \ndefendant’s due process rights.” (Id. ¶ 66; see also ¶¶ 56, 67-91.) “[U]nder these \nunique circumstances, it strains credulity to assume that mere questionnaires and \nvoir dire can effectively weed out biased residents.” In re Tsarnaev, 780 F.3d 14, \n38 (1st Cir. 2015) (Torruella, J., dissenting). \nIn the face of such overwhelming community-wide prejudice, several courts \nhave also recognized that it is not an effective use of judicial resources to engage in \nthe herculean task of calling and individually questioning an unwieldy number of \nveniremen in an attempt to empanel impartial juries. See, e.g., Murphy, 421 U.S. at \n802; United States v. Engleman, 489 F. Supp. 48, 50 (E.D. Mo. 1980); United \n                                                            \n31 See also United States v. Angiulo, 897 F.2d 1169, 1181 (1st Cir. 1990) (“Where \na high percentage of the venire admits to a disqualifying prejudice, a court may \nproperly  question  the  remaining  jurors’  avowals  of  impartiality,  and  choose  to \npresume prejudice”); Delaney v. United States, 199 F.2d 107, 112-13 (1st Cir. \n1952) (“[T]he average juror is [not] so endowed with a sense of detachment, so \nclear in his introspective perception of his own mental processes, that he may \nconfidently exclude even the unconscious influence of his preconceptions as to \nprobable guilt, engendered by a pervasive pre-trial publicity”). \n20 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 56 of 62    Pg ID 278\n \nStates v. Lawson, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16032, at *3 (E.D. Ky. Mar. 2, 2009) \n(unpublished) (Exhibit O). Indeed, the McVeigh Court found that deferment of \nvenue motions till the eve of trial are prejudicial because “a failed attempt to select \na jury would, itself, cause widespread public comment.” 918 F. Supp. at 1470. For \nthese reasons, the Court should not delay transfer of venue. \nB.  Alternatively, Transfer to the Northern Division of the Western \nDistrict is Appropriate under 28 U.S.C. 1404(a). \nMotions to transfer venue in civil cases are generally brought pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 1404(a). In assessing transfer under 1404(a), courts evaluate whether: (1) \nthe action could have been brought in the transferee district; (2) transfer serves the \ninterest  of  justice;  and  (3)  transfer  is  in  the  convenience  of  the  witnesses  and \nparties. Kepler v. ITT Sheraton Corp., 860 F. Supp. 393, 398 (E.D. Mich. 1994); \nsee also Moses v. Bus. Card Exp., Inc., 929 F.2d 1131, 1137 (6th Cir. 1991). \nWithin this framework, “[c]ourts have broad discretion.” Amphion, Inc. v. Buckeye \nElec. Co., 285 F. Supp. 2d 943, 946 (E.D. Mich. 2003).32 \nIt is, however, widely accepted that the “interest of justice” factor is the \nparamount consideration under 1404(a) and may, alone, dictate whether transfer is \nrequired. See, e.g., Victaulic Co. v. E. Indus. Supplies, Inc., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n172021, at *4 (D.S.C. Dec. 6, 2013) (unpublished) (Exhibit P) (“[T]he interest of \njustice factor  . . . may be decisive in ruling on a transfer motion, even though the \nconvenience of the parties and witnesses point in a different direction”); Bankers \n                                                            \n32 This action could have been brought in the Western District of Michigan because \nDefendants Wyant and Wurfel, among others, reside there.See Nappier v. Snyder, \n \nsupra; Anderson v. Snyder, supra. \n21 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 57 of 62    Pg ID 279\n \nTrust  Co.  v.  Crawford,  559  F.  Supp.  1359,  1363  (W.D.N.Y.  1983)  (“The \nparamount consideration [under 1404(a)] is the interest of justice”).33 \nIn determining whether transfer is within the “interest of justice,” courts \nmust  assess  whether  adverse  publicity  and  resulting  juror  prejudice  present \nobstacles to a fair trial. See, e.g., West Am. Ins. Co. v. Potts, 1990 U.S. App. \nLEXIS 12513, at *6 (6th Cir. July 25, 1990) (unpublished) (Exhibit Q); Haase v. \nGilboy,  246  F.  Supp.  594,  596  (E.D.  Wis.  1965)  (adverse  publicity  justified \ntransfer  of  venue);  New  York  v.  Gen.  Motors  Corp.,  357  F.  Supp.  327,  328 \n(S.D.N.Y.  1973)  (“Adverse  publicity  is  certainly  a  factor  which  a  court  may \nconsider in determining the propriety of transfer pursuant to § 1404”). \nThus, “[w]hen [a] trial judge becomes aware through massive news coverage \nthat a fair trial cannot be had in the place where the action was filed, the judge has \na duty to protect the defendant’s rights to a fair trial.” Wash.

As discussed in much more detail above, the prejudice levels here are \nsimply  extraordinary.  The  Court’s  jury  pool  has,  for  over  a  year  now,  been \nsaturated  with  “24/7”  publicity  blaming  Defendants  for  the  “lead-poisoning  of \nchildren”  and  depicting  them  as  “incompetent  bureaucrats,”  “criminals,”  and \n“racists.” Such reports have been inaccurate and cavalierly treat complicated issues \nof water chemistry and interpretations of complex federal regulations as foregone \nconclusions.  The  communities  making  up  this  Judicial  District  have  shown \npronounced support for the residents of Flint and acted out in indignation against \nDefendants; calling for resignations, arrests, convictions, and worse. Furthermore, \nat least 83% of this Court’s jury pool freely admits prejudice against the MDEQ \nDefendants. (Ex. A ¶¶ 48, 50, 57.)  \nAlthough Dr. Edelman recommends that this case be transferred to a venue \noutside of the State of Michigan because there are disturbing levels of prejudice \npervading both the Eastern and Western Districts of Michigan, his data shows that \nthe  Northern  Division  of  the  Western  District  “represents  the  least  prejudicial \noption available” in this State. (Id. ¶¶ 6, 109, 114.) The jury pool in the Northern \nDivision  “is  less  knowledgeable  about  prejudicial  media  reporting  surrounding \nevents in Flint, and less engaged in helping the residents there.” (Id.) Only 20% of \nrespondents from the Northern Division reported that they have donated money or \nresources to help Flint. (Id. ¶ 105.) And, only 10% felt that they or someone they \nknew personally had been impacted by the Flint water crisis. (Id. ¶ 104.)  \n23 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 59 of 62    Pg ID 281\n \nAccordingly,  if  the  Court  is  not  inclined  to  transfer  this  case  out  of \nMichigan, it is in the interest of justice for this case, as well as all pending motions, \nto be transferred to the Northern Division of the Western District of Michigan. \nWhere district courts are presented with both a motion to dismiss and a motion to \ntransfer venue, they commonly address the venue motion first, and, where transfer \nis appropriate, leave the motion to dismiss to be decided by the transferee court. \nSee, e.g., Hoffman v. Fairfax Cnty. Redev. & Hous. Auth., 276 F. Supp. 2d 14, 17 \n(D.D.C.  2003)  (transferee  court  better  suited  to  address  merits  of  motion  to \ndismiss); Brown v. New York, 947 F.Supp.2d 317, 326 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (deferring \ndecision  on  motion  to  dismiss  to  allow  the  transferee  court  an  opportunity  to \nconsider the merits of the case). \nIII.  CONCLUSION \nWHEREFORE, MDEQ Defendants respectfully request that this Honorable \nCourt: (a) grant their Motion to Change Venue; (b) transfer this case to either an \nout-of-state venue where they are more likely to receive a fair trial or, alternatively, \nto  the  Northern  Division  of  the  United  States  District  Court  for  the  Western \nDistrict of Michigan; and (c) award them any different or further relief this Court \ndeems equitable and just. \n   \n24 \n \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 45   Filed 10/27/16   Pg 60 of 62    Pg ID 282\n \nDated:  October 27, 2016              Respectfully submitted, \nFoster, Swift, Collins & Smith, P.C.

(Dkt. 113.)  They now move for \nreconsideration, arguing that correcting the Court’s “palpable defects” \nwill result in a different disposition.  (See Dkt. 116.)  First, according to \nthese defendants, the Court erred when it found that “it seems likely \nthat by the time trial commences, ‘the decibel level of media attention’ \nwill have ‘diminished somewhat.’”  (Id. at 6-8.)  Second, they argue that \nmost of the defendants, witnesses, and documentary evidence are not \nlocated in the Eastern District of Michigan.  (Id. at 8-10.) \nTo prevail on a motion for reconsideration under Local Rule 7.1, a \nmovant  must  “not  only  demonstrate  a  palpable  defect  by  which  the \ncourt  and  the  parties  and  other  persons  entitled  to  be  heard  on  the \nmotion have been misled but also show that correcting the defect will \nresult in a different disposition of the case.”  E.D. Mich. LR 7.1(h)(3).  “A \npalpable defect is a defect that is obvious, clear, unmistakable, manifest \nor plain.”  Witzke v. Hiller, 972 F. Supp. 426, 427 (E.D. Mich. 1997).  \nThe  “palpable  defect”  standard  is  consistent  with  the  standard  for \namending  or  altering  a  judgment  under  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  59(e).  \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   ECF No. 126   filed 02/09/17    PageID.4853    Page 3 of 7\nHenderson v. Walled Lake Consol. Schs., 469 F.3d 479, 496 (6th Cir. \n2006). \nMotions for reconsideration should not be granted if they “merely \npresent the same issues ruled upon by the court, either expressly or by \nreasonable implication.”  E.D. Mich. LR 7.1(h)(3).  But “parties cannot \nuse  a  motion  for  reconsideration  to  raise  new  legal  arguments  that \ncould have been raised before a judgment was issued.”  Roger Miller \nMusic,  Inc.  v.  Sony/ATV  Publ’g,  477  F.3d  383,  395  (6th  Cir.  2007).  \nNotably,  district  courts  are  increasingly  scrutinizing  improper  use  of \nmotions to reconsider.  See, e.g., Andersons, Inc. v. Consol, Inc., 208 F. \nSupp. 2d 847, 850 (N.D. Ohio 2002) (“Like the court in Nationwide, I \nhave  ‘noticed  a  recent  marked  increase  in  the  filings  of  motions  to \nreconsider.’  Also like that court, I hope that ‘publication of this Opinion \nand Order will advise the bar that the undersigned intends to begin \nissuing show cause orders as to why sanctions should not be imposed for \nimproper filings of motions to reconsider.’”) (quoting Nationwide Mut. \nFire Ins. Co. v. Huynh Pham, 193 F.R.D. 493, 495 (S.D. Miss. 2000)). \nAs  to  the  MDEQ  Employee  Defendants’  first  argument,  they \n“merely present the same issue[] ruled upon by the court.”  See E.D. \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   ECF No. 126   filed 02/09/17    PageID.4854    Page 4 of 7\nMich. LR 7.1(h)(3).  Plaintiffs raised the issue in their response brief.  \n(Dkt. 94 at 17-18 (“The shelf life of publicity is notably short and the \nconditions at the time of trial in this case which will not occur for some \ntime will likely be significantly different than that surveyed by MDEQ \nDefendants’ proffered expert. . . .  Skilling [v. United States, 561 U.S. \n358,  383  (2010)]  (noting  that  the  decibel  level  of  media  attention \ndiminishes over time).”).)  And the MDEQ Employee Defendants replied \nthat  “[w]hile  national  coverage  has  waned,  adverse  local  coverage \ncontinues to grow daily with no signs of relenting, as does the prejudice \nheld  by  this  Court’s  jury  pool.”    (Dkt.  109  at  6.)    They  repeat  the \nargument in their motion to reconsider.  (See Dkt. 119 at 6-8.)  Thus, \nthis is an improper ground on which to move for reconsideration.  See \nE.D. Mich. LR 7.1(h)(3). \nAs for their second argument, the MDEQ Employee Defendants \n“could have [] raised” the argument “before a judgment was issued,” but \ndid not.  See Roger Miller Music, Inc., 477 F.3d at 395; see generally \n(Dkt. 113 at 17 (“The MDEQ Employee Defendants do not make any \narguments as to the multiple factors that must be considered before \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   ECF No. 126   filed 02/09/17    PageID.4855    Page 5 of 7\ngranting [] a motion [under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a)].”)).1  Thus, this is also \nan improper ground on which to move for reconsideration.  Id. \nAnd  even  if  these  findings  were  “obvious[ly],  clear[ly], \nunmistakabl[y], manifest[ly,] or plain[ly]” incorrect, see Witzke, 972 F. \nSupp. at 427, the MDEQ Employee Defendants fail to “demonstrate . . . \nthat correcting the defect will result in a different disposition of the \ncase.”    E.D.  Mich.  LR  7.1(h)(3).    That  “‘the  decibel  level  of  media \nattention’  will  have  ‘diminished  somewhat’”  was  only  one  of  the \nconsiderations  that  the  Court  found  weighed  against  a  transfer  of \nvenue.  (See Dkt. 113 at 14-15.)  The considerations that were most \ncompelling  to  the  Court  weigh  against  transferring  venue  at  this \nstage—the local jury pool is large and diverse, and the consideration “of \n                                      \n1 The MDEQ Employee Defendants argue that attorneys Dennis Egan and Michael \nPattwell did not contradict one another regarding whether these defendants are \nseeking a transfer under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a).  (Dkt. 116 at 9 n.2.)  The Court does \nnot see how it could be read another way.  Mr. Egan stated at the hearing that “the \ncases  that  we’re  going  to  discuss,  none  of  them  are  analyzing  it  under  a  1404 \ntransfer because a 1404 transfer can’t fly.”  (Dkt. 116-3 at 12.)  According to Mr. \nEgan, “a 1404 transfer can’t fly” because “[o]ne of the requirements is it has to be \nsent to a venue where the case could have been brought,” and “this case could not.”  \n(Id.)  Mr. Pattwell stated immediately thereafter that in fact “we cite a number of \ncases in our brief under 1404(a),” specifically under the “interest of justice factor.”  \n(Id. at 13.)  And in that original brief, the MDEQ Employee Defendants argue that \n“[t]his action could have been brought in the Western District of Michigan because \n[d]efendants Wyant and Wurfel, among others, reside there.”  (Dkt. 45 at 56 n.32.)  \nIn any case, the Court finds that the argument was not waived given Mr. Pattwell’s \nclarification. \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   ECF No. 126   filed 02/09/17    PageID.4856    Page 6 of 7\nprime  significance,”  according  to  the  Supreme  Court,  does  not  apply \nhere because no jury verdict has yet been reached.  (Id. at 16.) \nFinally, even if the MDEQ Employee Defendants are correct that \nmost of the defendants, witnesses, and documentary evidence are not \nlocated in the Eastern District of Michigan, the result is the same.  The \nMDEQ Employee Defendants note that those defendants, documents, \nand witnesses are located in and around Lansing, MI, but they seek to \ntransfer venue to the Northern Division of the Western District or out of \nstate.  (See Dkt. 116 at 8-10.)  To argue that the convenience of the \nparties and witnesses is served by transferring the case even farther \nfrom  most  of  the  defendants,  documents,  and  witnesses  defies  logic.  \nThe  Court  would  not  have  come  out  the  other  way  had  the  MDEQ \nEmployee Defendants made this argument when they could have. \nAccordingly,  their  motion  for  reconsideration  (Dkt.  116)  is \nDENIED. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nDated: February 9, 2017    s/Judith E.

B., a minor, \nand DIOGENES MUSE-CLEVELAND, by and through their attorneys, complaining against \nDefendants herein, state as follows: \nINTRODUCTION \n \n1.  This case arises from the poisoning of Plaintiffs, residents of the City of Flint, \nMichigan, with lead from Flint’s pipes and service lines, as a result of the switch of Flint’s \ndrinking water supply to the Flint River, without the use of any corrosion control. \n2.  Defendants created and maintained this condition when the State of Michigan \nsubsumed the authority of the local government; and also through the actions of the state’s \nregulatory and administrative entities and employees. \n3.  In 2014, Defendants discovered that dangerous levels of lead were leaching into \nFlint’s drinking water.  Not only did Defendants fail to take any measures to eliminate this \ndanger, as required by federal law, but they actually took affirmative steps to downplay the \nseverity of the contamination from its citizens.  In so doing, Defendants negligently and \nrecklessly exposed Plaintiffs to devastating and irreversible health problems. \n4.  Plaintiffs seek recovery from Defendants for injuries, damages and losses suffered \nby Plaintiffs as a result of exposure to the introduction of lead and other toxic substances from \n  2 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 3 of 89    Pg ID 3\nDefendants’ ownership, use, management, supervision, storage, maintenance, disposal, and \nrelease of highly corrosive water from the Flint River into the drinking water of Flint, Michigan.  \n5.  The actions of the City of Flint and the State of Michigan, along with their \nagencies and employees in inflicting immeasurable harm on Plaintiffs amounts to violations of \nPlaintiffs’ constitutional rights. \n6.  The injuries to Plaintiffs resulted not only from the acts of the individual \nDefendants but from the policy and/or practice of the State of Michigan, its agencies, and the \nCity of Flint. \n7.  Defendants, acting for the state and/or city under color of law, deprived Plaintiffs \nof their constitutional rights. \n8.  The State of Michigan and/or City of Flint provided a mantle of authority to the \nindividual Defendants that enhanced their power as harm-causing individual actors. \n9.  The individual Defendants’ conduct was so dominated by governmental authority \nthat the individual Defendants must be deemed to act with the authority of the government. \n10.  Plaintiffs bring this action for damages against those Defendants named in their \nindividual capacities who acted under color of law in depriving Plaintiffs of their constitutional \nrights, and against the City of Flint. \n11.  Plaintiffs bring this action for prospective relief only as against the State of \nMichigan, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, and the Michigan Department of \nHealth and Human Services. \n12.  The health effects of lead poisoning are well known.  The CDC has noted that: \n“No safe blood level in children has been identified.  Even low levels in blood have been shown \nto affect IQ, ability to pay attention, and academic achievement.”  Lead impacts nearly every \n  3 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 4 of 89    Pg ID 4\norgan and system in the human body.  Lead causes multitudinous and serious injuries to the \nnervous system, which can lead to convulsions, coma and brain death.  It causes learning and \nbehavioral disorders, memory loss, nausea, anemia, hearing loss, fatigue, colic, hypertension, \nand myalgia.  Moreover, children under the age of 6 years old are more susceptible to the toxic \neffects of lead than are adults since the brain and central nervous system are not completely \ndeveloped. \n13.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ negligent, grossly negligent, and \nreckless conduct, Plaintiffs were directly exposed to hazardous and toxic substances known to \ncause disease, and that this exposure caused or contributed to Plaintiffs’ injuries. Therefore, the \ndoctrine of joint and several liability should be extended to apply to each Defendant herein, in \ntheir individual capacity. \n14.  As a direct and proximate result of the Defendants’ conduct, Plaintiffs have \nsuffered injuries and currently suffer and will continue to suffer damages and losses which \ninclude, but are not limited to, physical and psychological injuries, learning and other permanent \ndisabilities, pain, mental anguish, emotional distress, the loss of household services, the cost of \nmedical, educational and rehabilitation expenses and other expenses of training and assistance, \nand loss of earnings, income, and earning capacity.  Such injuries, damages and losses are \nreasonably likely to continue to occur in the future. \nPARTIES \n15.  Plaintiff SHARI GUERTIN is, and has at all times relevant hereto been, a resident \nof Flint connected to Flint’s water system and a paying consumer of Flint water. SHARI \nGUERTIN and her minor child, E. B., have been exposed to extremely high levels of lead due to \nthe actions of the Defendants, having bathed in and consumed lead contaminated water. \n  4 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 5 of 89    Pg ID 5\n16.  Plaintiff is, and has at all times relevant hereto been, a resident of Flint connected \nto Flint’s water system.  Plaintiff has been exposed to extremely high levels of lead due to the \nactions of the Defendants, having bathed in and consumed lead contaminated water. \n17.  As a result of Defendants’ actions, Plaintiffs have suffered injuries including but \nnot necessarily limited to: various health problems (including without limitation, hair, skin, \ndigestive and other organ problems), physical pain and suffering, mental anguish, fright and \nshock, disability, denial of social pleasures and enjoyments, embarrassment, humiliation, and \nmortification, medical expenses, wage loss, brain and/or developmental injuries including \n(without limitation) cognitive deficits, lost earning capacity, aggravation of pre-existing \nconditions, contract damages and property damages (including but not limited to damaged \nplumbing and lost real property value). \n18.  Defendant City of Flint (“”Flint” or “the City”) is a Michigan municipal \ncorporation located in Genesee County, Michigan. \n19.  Through its Department of Public Works, Flint distributes water to its nearly \n100,000 residents. \n20.  When Flint Emergency Manager Darnell Earley, as the City’s final policymaking \nauthority, made the decision, on behalf of the State of Michigan and the City, to rush the \ndistribution of water from the Flint River without proper treatment, including corrosion control, \nPlaintiffs were poisoned. \n21.  It was the official custom, policy, and/or practice of the City, for which it is \ndirectly responsible, that led to the violations of Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights described herein. \n22.  The actions of lower level City employees, not named as defendants herein, in \ndelivering residents unsafe water were constrained by policies not of their own making. Flint’s \n  5 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 6 of 89    Pg ID 6\nwater treatment employees were inadequately trained, in light of the duties assigned to them the \nneed for more training was obvious, and the inadequacy was so likely to result in the violation of \nconstitutional rights that Flint’s policy makers can reasonably said to have been deliberately \nindifferent to the need for additional training. The City is liable because through its policy \nmakers it violated the constitutional rights of Plaintiffs, including but not limited to the rights to \nbodily integrity and to be free from state created danger. \n23.  Defendant Howard Croft was at all relevant times Flint’s Department of Public \nWorks Director acting within the scope of his employment and/or authority under color of law. \nHe is sued herein in his individual and official capacities. At all relevant times Croft knew that \nthe City’s water treatment plant was unprepared to adequately provide safe drinking water to \nFlint’s residents. He nonetheless caused and allowed unsafe water to be delivered to Flint’s \nresidents and did not disclose that Flint’s water was unsafe. Defendant Croft also made \nnumerous false statements about the safety and quality of Flint’s water that he knew to be untrue. \nDefendant Croft violated clearly established constitutional rights of Plaintiffs, including but not \nlimited to the rights to bodily integrity and to be free from state created danger. Defendant \nCroft’s actions further constitute gross negligence, as he had a substantial lack of concern and/or \nwillful disregard for whether an injury resulted to Plaintiffs. \n24.  Defendant Michael Glasgow was at all relevant times a water treatment plant \noperator for the City of Flint acting within the scope of his employment and/or authority under \ncolor of law. He is sued herein in his individual and official capacities. Glasgow knew that the \nCity’s water treatment plant was unprepared to adequately provide safe drinking water to Flint’s \nresidents. He nonetheless allowed unsafe water to be delivered to Flint’s residents and did not \ndisclose that Flint’s water was unsafe. Defendant Glasgow violated clearly established \n  6 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 7 of 89    Pg ID 7\nconstitutional rights of Plaintiffs, including but not limited to the rights to bodily integrity and to \nbe free from state created danger. Defendant Glasgow’s actions further constitute gross \nnegligence, as he had a substantial lack of concern and/or willful disregard for whether an injury \nresulted to Plaintiffs. \n25.  Defendant State of Michigan (“Michigan” or “the State”) directs, controls, and \noperates Defendant Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (“MDEQ”) and Defendant \nMichigan Department of Health and Human Services (“MDHHS”). The State also stood in the \nshoes of the City of Flint at all times relevant hereto, having absorbed the authority of the City of \nFlint. \n26.  Defendant Richard Snyder (“Governor Snyder”) is the Governor of Michigan. He \nis sued herein in his individual and official capacities. He was at all times acting within the scope \nof his employment and/or authority under color of law. Governor Snyder participated in, \ndirected, and facilitated the State’s decision to transition Flint’s water source from safe, treated \nwater to untreated corrosive water that would deliver lead into Plaintiffs’ home. He also \nparticipated in, directed, and facilitated the State’s insufficient response to protect Plaintiffs from \nthe State’s actions. \n27.  Under color of state law, Governor Snyder violated clearly established \nconstitutional rights of Plaintiffs, including but not limited to the rights to bodily integrity and to \nbe free from state created danger. \n28.  Defendant Darnell Earley (“Earley”) was Governor Snyder’s Emergency Manager \nin Flint from November 1, 2013, through January 12, 2015, and at all times relevant hereto was \nacting within the scope of his employment and/or authority under color of law. He is sued herein \nin his official and individual capacities. Earley made the decision to switch to Flint River water. \n  7 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 8 of 89    Pg ID 8\nEarley made false and/or misleading statements representing that the water was safe to drink as it \npoisoned thousands. Earley violated clearly established constitutional rights of Plaintiffs, \nincluding but not limited to the rights to bodily integrity and to be free from state created danger. \nEarley’s actions constitute gross negligence, as he had a substantial lack of concern and/or \nwillful disregard for whether an injury resulted to Plaintiffs.  \n29.  Defendant Gerald Ambrose (“Ambrose”) was Governor Snyder’s Emergency \nManager in Flint from January 13, 2015, until April 28, 2015, and was at all times relevant \nhereto acting within the scope of his employment and/or authority under color of law. He is sued \nherein in his official and individual capacities. Defendant Ambrose was also an employee of the \nState of Michigan as a financial advisor for Flint’s financial emergency from January 2012, until \nDecember 2014. He was involved in and directed the State’s decision to transition Flint from \nsafe, treated water on an aggressive timeline to corrosive, untreated water from an unprepared \nwater treatment plant. He also made false and/or misleading statements representing that the \nwater was safe to drink as it poisoned thousands. Defendant Ambrose violated clearly established \nconstitutional rights of Plaintiffs, including but not limited to the rights to bodily integrity and to \nbe free from state created danger. Defendant Ambrose’s actions constitute gross negligence, as \nhe had a substantial lack of concern and/or willful disregard for whether an injury resulted to \nPlaintiffs. \n30.  Defendant Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (“MDEQ”) is the state \nagency responsible for implementing safe drinking water laws, rules, and regulations in \nMichigan, and Flint specifically. The MDEQ failed to require corrosion control for Flint River \nwater in violation of the federal Lead and Copper Rule, misled the federal EPA, conducted \nillegal and improper sampling of Flint’s water, lied to the public about the safety of Flint’s water, \n  8 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 9 of 89    Pg ID 9\nand attempted to publicly discredit outside individuals that offered evidence of the water’s \ncontamination. The MDEQ was consistently more concerned with satisfying its own perceptions \nof technical rules than carrying out its duty to the people of Flint, ignoring voluminous evidence \nof the crisis it had created until its denial could no longer withstand outside scrutiny. \n31.  Defendant Liane Shekter-Smith (“Shekter-Smith”) was at all relevant times Chief \nof the Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance for MDEQ, acting within the scope of \nher employment and/or authority under color of law, until she was removed from her position on \nOctober 19, 2015. She is sued herein in her individual and official capacities. Defendant Shekter-\nSmith was grossly negligent in that she knowingly participated in, approved of, and caused the \ndecision to transition Flint’s water source to a highly corrosive, inadequately studied and treated \nalternative. She disseminated false statements to the public that led to the continued consumption \nof dangerous water despite knowing or having reason to know that the water was dangerous. \nDefendant Shekter-Smith violated clearly  established constitutional rights of Plaintiffs, \nincluding but not limited to the rights to bodily integrity and to be free from state created danger. \nDefendant Shekter-Smith’s actions constitute gross negligence, as she had a substantial lack of \nconcern and/or willful disregard for whether an injury resulted to Plaintiffs. \n32.   Defendant Daniel Wyant (“Wyant”) was at all relevant times the Director of \nMDEQ until Governor Snyder accepted his resignation on or about December 29, 2015, acting \nwithin the scope of his employment and/or authority under color of law. He is sued herein in his \nofficial and individual capacities. Wyant participated in, directed, and oversaw the MDEQ’s \nrepeated violations of federal water quality laws, the failure to properly study and treat Flint \nRiver water, and the MDEQ’s program of systemic denial, lies, and attempts to discredit honest \noutsiders. He disseminated false statements to the public that led to the continued consumption \n  9 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 10 of 89    Pg ID 10\nof dangerous water despite knowing or having reason to know that the water was dangerous. \nDefendant Wyant violated clearly established constitutional rights of Plaintiffs, including but not \nlimited to the rights to bodily integrity and to be free from state created danger. Defendant \nWyant’s actions constitute gross negligence, as he had a substantial lack of concern and/or \nwillful disregard for whether an injury resulted to Plaintiffs \n33.  Defendant Stephen Busch (“Busch”) was at all relevant times the District \nSupervisor assigned to the Lansing District Office of the MDEQ and was acting within the scope \nof his employment and/or authority under color of law. He is sued herein in his official and \nindividual capacities. He participated in MDEQ’s repeated violations of federal water quality \nlaws, the failure to properly study and treat Flint River water, and the MDEQ’s program of \nsystemic denial, lies, and attempts to discredit honest outsiders. He personally falsely reported to \nthe EPA that Flint had enacted an optimized corrosion control plan, providing assurances to \nPlaintiffs that the water was safe when he knew or should have known that these assurances were \nfalse, or were no more likely to be true than false. Defendant Busch violated clearly established \nconstitutional rights of Plaintiffs, including but not limited to the rights to bodily integrity and to \nbe free from state created danger. Defendant Busch’s actions constitute gross negligence, as he \nhad a substantial lack of concern and/or willful disregard for whether an injury resulted to \nPlaintiffs. \n34.  Defendant Patrick Cook (“Cook”) was at all relevant times Water Treatment \nSpecialist assigned to the Lansing Community Drinking Water Unit of the MDEQ and was \nacting within the scope of his employment and/or authority under color of law. He is sued herein \nin his official and individual capacities. Cook is individually liable because he, as the Lansing \nCommunity Drinking Unit manager, in a grossly negligent manner, participated in, approved, \n  10 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 11 of 89    Pg ID 11\nand/or assented to the decision to allow Flint’s water to be delivered to residents without \ncorrosion control or proper study and/or testing. Defendant Cook violated clearly established \nconstitutional rights of Plaintiffs, including but not limited to the rights to bodily integrity and to \nbe free from state created danger. Defendant Cook’s actions constitute gross negligence, as he \nhad a substantial lack of concern and/or willful disregard for whether an injury resulted to \nPlaintiffs. \n35.  Defendant Michael Prysby (“Prysby”) was at all relevant times an the Engineer \nassigned to District 11 (Genesee County) of the MDEQ and was acting within the scope of his \nemployment and/or authority and was acting within the scope of his employment and/or \nauthority under color of law. He is sued herein in his official and individual capacities. Prysby is \nindividually liable because he, as the engineer assigned to District 11, participated in, approved, \nand/or assented to the decision to switch the water source, failed to properly monitor and/or test \nthe Flint River water, and provided assurances to Plaintiffs that the Flint River water was safe \nwhen he knew or should have known those statements to be untrue, or no more likely to be true \nthan false. Defendant Prysby violated clearly established constitutional rights of Plaintiffs, \nincluding but not limited to the rights to bodily integrity and to be free from state created danger. \nDefendant Prysby’s action constitute gross negligence, as he had a substantial lack of concern \nand/or willful disregard for whether an injury resulted to Plaintiffs. \n36.  Defendant Bradley Wurfel (“Wurfel”) was at all relevant times the Director of \nCommunications for MDEQ and was acting within the scope of his employment and/or authority \nunder color of law. He is sued herein in his official and individual capacities. Wurfel resigned his \nposition on December 29, 2015.  Wurfel served as the MDEQ’s principal means of public \ndeception, repeatedly denying the increasingly obvious disaster as it unfolded and attempting to \n  11 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 12 of 89    Pg ID 12\ndiscredit the only reliable people in the picture. Wurfel would eventually be relieved of his duties \nfor his “persistent [negative] tone and derision” and his “aggressive dismissal, belittlement and \nattempts to discredit the individuals involved in [conducting independent studies and tests].”  \n37.  Defendant, Wurfel repeatedly made public statements that created, increased, and \nprolonged the risks and harms facing Plaintiffs. Defendant Wurfel violated clearly established \nconstitutional rights of Plaintiffs, including but not limited to the rights to bodily integrity and to \nbe free from state created danger. He made such statements knowing that they were false or that \nthey were no more likely to be true than false. Defendant Wurfel’s actions constitute gross \nnegligence, as he had a substantial lack of concern and/or willful disregard for whether an injury \nresulted to Plaintiffs. \n38.  Defendant Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (“MDHHS”) is \nthe state agency responsible for public health. Instead of protecting public health, MDHHS \ndeliberately hid information that would have revealed the public health crisis in Flint, which \nMDHHS had earlier failed to detect. MDHHS’s failure to properly analyze data led it to \nconclude that there was no increase in lead contamination in Flint’s children, and it resisted and \nobstructed the efforts of outside researchers and the county health department to determine \nwhether that was the actually true and correct. \n39.  Defendant Eden Wells (“Wells”), was at all relevant times Chief Medical \nExecutive within the Population Health and Community Services Department of the MDHHS \nand was acting within the scope of her employment and/or authority under color of law. She is \nsued herein in her official and individual capacities. Wells participated in, directed, and/or \noversaw the department’s efforts to hide information to save face, and to obstruct the efforts of \noutside researchers. Further, Wells knew as early as 2014 of problems with lead and legionella \n  12 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 13 of 89    Pg ID 13\ncontamination in Flint’s water and instead of fulfilling her duty to protect and notify the public, \nshe participated in hiding this information. Defendant Wells violated clearly established \nconstitutional rights of Plaintiffs, including but not limited to the rights to bodily integrity and to \nbe free from state created danger. Defendant Wells’s actions constitute gross negligence, as she \nhad a substantial lack of concern and/or willful disregard for whether an injury resulted to \nPlaintiffs. \n40.  Defendant Nick Lyon was at all relevant times Director of MDHHS and was \nacting within the scope of his employment and/or authority under color of law. He is sued herein \nin his official and individual capacities. He participated in, directed, and/or oversaw the \ndepartment’s efforts to hide information to save face, and to obstruct and discredit the efforts of \noutside researchers. He knew as early as 2014 of problems with lead and legionella \ncontamination in Flint’s water and instead of fulfilling his duty to protect and notify the public, \nhe participated in hiding this information. Defendant Lyons violated clearly established \nconstitutional rights of Plaintiffs including but not limited to the rights to bodily integrity and to \nbe free from state created danger. Defendant  Lyons’ actions constitute gross negligence, as he \nhad a substantial lack of concern and/or willful disregard for whether an injury resulted to \nPlaintiffs. \n41.  Defendant Nancy Peeler was at all relevant times a MDHHS employee in charge \nof its childhood lead poisoning prevention program, acting within the scope of her employment \nand/or authority under color of law. She is sued herein in her official and individual capacities. \nShe participated in, directed, and/or oversaw the department’s efforts to hide information to save \nface, and actively sought to obstruct and discredit the efforts of outside researchers. Even when \nher own department had data that verified outside evidence of a lead contamination problem, she \n  13 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 14 of 89    Pg ID 14\ncontinued trying to generate evidence to the contrary. Defendant Peeler violated clearly \nestablished constitutional rights of Plaintiffs, including but not limited to the rights to bodily \nintegrity and to be free from state created danger. Defendant Peeler’s actions constituted gross \nnegligence, as she had a substantial lack of concern and/or willful disregard for whether an injury \nresulted to Plaintiffs. \n42.  Defendant Robert Scott was at all relevant times Data Manager for MDHHS’s \nHealthy Homes and Lead Prevention Program, acting within the scope of his employment and/or \nauthority under color of law. He is sued herein in his official and individual capacities. He \nparticipated in, directed, and/or oversaw the department’s efforts to hide information to save \nface, and actively sought to obstruct and discredit the efforts of outside researchers. Even when \nhis own department had data that verified outside evidence of a lead contamination problem, he \ncontinued trying to generate evidence to the contrary. He also served a key role in withholding \nand/or delaying disclosure of data that outside researchers needed to protect the people of Flint. \nDefendant Scott violated clearly established constitutional rights of Plaintiffs, including but not \nlimited to the rights to bodily integrity and to be free from state created danger. Defendant \nScott’s actions constitute gross negligence, as he had a substantial lack of concern and/or willful \ndisregard for whether an injury resulted to Plaintiff. \n43.  Susan Hedman, former EPA Region 5 Administrator, cannot yet be named as a \nDefendant pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act (“FTCA”). Plaintiffs note that if their \nanticipated FTCA claims to the EPA are rejected, they may seek to amend their complaint in \norder to add claims against Ms. Hedman. \n44.  Defendant Veolia North America, LLC (“Veolia”) is a Delaware corporation with \nits principal office in Illinois. Veolia is a Defendant in this action based on its provision of \n  14 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 15 of 89    Pg ID 15\nnegligent professional engineering services in reviewing Flint’s water system and declaring the \nwater safe to drink. Veolia maintains an office in Wayne County, Michigan, transacts business in \nthe State of Michigan, including the business it performed for the City of Flint in 2015, and has \ncommitted a tort in the State of Michigan, among bases for personal jurisdiction under MCL \n600.705. Each of these bases extends to this District specifically. \n45.  Defendant Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, Inc. (“LAN”) is a Texas corporation \nwith its principal office in Texas. LAN is a Defendant in this action based on its provision of \nnegligent professional engineering services in preparing Flint’s water treatment facility to treat \nwater from the Flint River. LAN maintains an office in Flint, Genesee County, Michigan, \nregularly conducts business in the Eastern District of Michigan, and has committed a tort in the \nState of Michigan, among bases for personal jurisdiction under MCL 600.705. Each of these \nbases extends to this District specifically. \nJURISDICTION & VENUE \n46.  This Court has jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claims pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 1331, as those claims arise under the Constitution and laws of the United States. This \nCourt has jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ remaining claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367 because \nthey are so related to claims in this action within the Court’s original jurisdiction that they form \npart of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States. \n47.  This action does not present novel or complex issues of State law that \npredominate over claims for which this Court has original jurisdiction.  \n48.  There are no compelling reasons for declining supplemental jurisdiction over \nthose of Plaintiffs’ claims that do not arise under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n  15 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 16 of 89    Pg ID 16\n49.  All Defendants reside in this district within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 1391(c). \nThis Court has personal jurisdiction over all Defendants because a Michigan state court would \nhave personal jurisdiction under MCL 600.701 and MCL 600.705. \n50.  Venue in this District is appropriate pursuant to to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1) and (2). \n51.  Mich. Comp. Laws 600.6440 exempts actions against State agencies from the \njurisdiction of the Michigan Court of Claims where the claimant has an adequate remedy in the \nfederal courts. \nFACTS \n52.  The outrageous actions of Defendants in this matter have caused harm to \nPlaintiffs. \n53.  The actions of those state employees sued in their individual capacities, acting \nunder color of law, in failing to protect Plaintiffs and then obscuring their mistake as Plaintiffs \ncontinued to suffer, constitute gross negligence and/or constitutional violations for which they \nare not afforded immunity. \n54.  Two private entities contributed to this public health catastrophe when they \nnegligently undertook to provide services for Flint’s water system, resulting in the poisoning of \nthousands, including Plaintiffs. \n55.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ actions and/or failures to act, \nPlaintiffs’ constitutional and other rights have been violated and they have suffered serious \nphysical, mental, and emotional injury, as well as property damage, as described in this \ncomplaint. \n  16 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 17 of 89    Pg ID 17\nThe State of Michigan Completely Overtook \nand Replaced Flint’s Representative City Government  \n \n56.  At all times between December, 2011 and April 30, 2015, the City of Flint was \nunder the control and authority of an Emergency Manager appointed by, and serving at the \npleasure of, Governor Snyder. \n57.  Michael Brown served Governor Snyder as Flint’s emergency manager from \nDecember of 2011, until August of 2012. \n58.  Ed Kurtz served Governor Snyder as Flint’s emergency manager from August of \n2012, until July of 2013. \n59.  Michael Brown again served Governor Snyder as Flint’s emergency manager \nfrom July of 2013, until October of 2013. \n60.  Defendant Earley served Governor Snyder as Flint’s emergency manager from \nOctober of 2013, until January of 2015. \n61.  Defendant Ambrose served Governor Snyder as Flint’s emergency manager from \nJanuary of 2015, until April 30, 2015.  \n62.  Therefore, at all relevant times prior to April 30, 2015, Flint’s local government \nwas under the control of the State of Michigan. \nThe MDEQ, as a Matter of Pattern, Practice, Custom, and Policy, Has Failed to  \nAdequately Protect Michigan Citizens Against Lead Contaminated Drinking Water \n \n63.  In 2010, the EPA commissioned a report that indicated problems with the \nMDEQ’s ability to ensure safe drinking water. \n64.  The report noted that funding cuts caused important MDEQ drinking water \npositions to be filled “with staff from other programs that have been cut or eliminated.... While \nthis practice preserves jobs, it decreases the technical knowledge of staff[.]” \n  17 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 18 of 89    Pg ID 18\n65.  The report flatly stated that “[t]raining for new staff would also be appreciated on \nfundamental public health issues and compliance decisions.” \n66.  The report also indicated a number of technical shortcomings with the way the \nMDEQ regulated the state’s drinking water, particularly as it related to lead contamination. \n67.  Specifically, the report noted that while federal regulations require water utilities \nto certify that the drinking water of 90% of homes in a given community contain no more than \n15 parts per billion (“ppb”) of lead, MDEQ had a practice of not even calculating “90th \npercentiles” unless a potential exceedence had been identified. This “does not meet the \nrequirements of Federal Regulations, since it is required that all 90th percentiles be calculated.”  \n68.  The report also noted that MDEQ did not conduct the required number of water \nsamples for lead, apparently in an effort to conserve agency resources. \n69.  Organizational and individual actions and failures of the MDEQ, such as those \nillustrated in the report, directly resulted in the Flint catastrophe. \nThe MDEQ Failed to Follow the U.S. Environmental Protection  \nAgency’s Lead and Copper Rule in Flint And to Take Reasonable  \nAction to Prevent Flint’s Residents \n \n70.  The United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) is responsible for \nsetting rules under the Safe Drinking Water Act. \n71.  Enforcement and implementation of those rules is delegated to state \nenvironmental agencies. In the case of Michigan, that agency is the MDEQ. \n72.  The EPA’s Lead and Copper Rule (“LCR”) has been enacted to establish \nprotocols to ensure that public water systems do not allow unsafe levels of lead or copper to \ncontaminate their drinking water supply. \n  18 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 19 of 89    Pg ID 19\n73.  While failing to protect Plaintiffs, the MDEQ violated both the letter and spirit of \nthe LCR. \n74.  Specifically, the MDEQ violated the letter and spirit of the LCR in at least the \nfollowing ways: \na.  By failing to require corrosion control for Flint River water from the time \nFlint began drawing it; \nb.  By misinforming the EPA about whether corrosion control was being \nutilized; \nc.  By improperly conducting sampling. \n75.  Instead of taking any preventative measures, the MDEQ determined it was \nsufficient to conduct two rounds of six-month lead sampling, using Flint’s residents, including \nPlaintiffs, as guinea pigs in a process of trial and error. \n76.  The first round of lead sampling was conducted between July and December \n2014, and the second between January and June 2015. Despite the fact that the sampling \nprocedures were woefully inadequate, the tests showed rising lead levels in Flint’s water. \n77.  In conducting the sampling required under the LCR, the MDEQ collected an \ninsufficient number of samples, consistent with MDEQ’s pattern, practice, policy, and custom. \n78.  Further, the LCR requires at least 50% of homes sampled to be verified as having \nlead pipes, with the remaining 50% to have been built before 1986 and known to have lead \nsolder. \n79.  Flint’s data was essentially useless because the MDEQ failed to require that the \nappropriate number of samples be drawn from these “high risk” homes. \n  19 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 20 of 89    Pg ID 20\n80.  Because an insufficient number of samples were taken from a pool of homes that \nwere not properly determined to be “high risk,” the City of Flint has not had a valid LCR \nsampling event since the switch to the Flint River. \n81.  The MDEQ, through its former director, has explicitly admitted that it did not \nfollow the LCR, and that it should have required corrosion control. \n82.  Had the MDEQ followed the LCR, it would have required water quality \nparameters and optimized corrosion control on the Flint River water from the very beginning, \nwhich likely would have prevented the entire public health catastrophe that has caused Plaintiffs \nto suffer injuries and damages. \n83.  Instead, the MDEQ engaged in a pattern of obfuscation and aggressive denial \nsince the time the source of Flint’s water was changed. \n84.  At all relevant times, MDEQ and its employees (incorrectly) insisted, despite \noverwhelming information to the contrary, that it was minimally in compliance with technical \nrules. No effort was made to do a single thing more, even when it became obvious that \nDefendants had created a public health catastrophe, until outside observers forced Defendants \ninto action. \nUnder the State’s Authority, Flint’s Water Supply Was Switched to the Flint River  \nWithout the Provision of Any Corrosion Control, Causing Poisonous Lead from Thousands \nof Pipes to Leach Into Plaintiffs’ Drinking Water \n \n85.  For decades prior to April 25, 2014, the City of Flint received safe, clean, treated \ndrinking water from the Detroit Water and Sewer Department (“DWSD”). \n86.  In November of 2012, Emergency Manager Ed Kurtz wrote to Treasurer Andy \nDillon suggesting that Flint join the yet-to-be-formed Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) due \nto cost savings over DWSD. \n  20 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 21 of 89    Pg ID 21\n87.  In April, 2013, Dillon gave Kurtz permission to notify the DWSD that it would be \nterminating service and switching to the KWA in the coming years. \n88.  On April 16, 2013, Kurtz ordered that Flint would switch its long term water \nsupplier from the DWSD to the KWA. \n89.  The KWA depended on an infrastructure that had not yet been built. \n90.  While waiting for the KWA to come online, the Emergency Manager ordered that \ninstead of temporarily remaining with DWSD, Flint would switch to the Flint River as a \ntemporary source for the City’s water. \n91.  The temporary use of the Flint River was also designed as a cost-cutting measure. \n92.  The Flint River was studied for use as a primary water source in a 2011 feasibility \nreport, of which Defendants were aware. At that time, the Flint River was rejected because the \ncosts to prepare Flint’s water treatment plant to treat Flint River water to applicable standards \nwere estimated to be in the tens of millions of dollars. \n93.  On March 7, 2014, Defendant Earley, who had replaced Kurtz, sent a letter to the \nDWSD stating “[w]e expect that the Flint Water Treatment Plant will be fully operational and \ncapable of treating Flint River water prior to the date of termination. In that case, there will be no \nneed for Flint to continue purchasing water to serve its residents and businesses after April 17, \n2014.” \n94.  Even Defendant Earley knew that the important limitation was that the treatment \nplant be ready to treat Flint River water. The treatment plant was not ready, but he forced the \ntransition through in order to meet the aggressive deadline he had self-imposed to cut costs. \n95.  Defendant Michael Glasgow, the water treatment plant’s laboratory and water \nquality supervisor informed the MDEQ on April 16, 2014, that he was “expecting changes to our \n  21 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 22 of 89    Pg ID 22\nWater Quality Monitoring parameters, and possibly our DBP on lead & copper monitoring \nplan... Any information would be appreciated, because it looks as if we will be starting the plant \nup tomorrow and are being pushed to start distributing water as soon as possible... I would like to \nmake sure we are monitoring, reporting and meeting requirements before I give the OK to start \ndistributing water.” \n96.  The next day, Defendant Glasgow wrote to MDEQ, including Defendants Prysby \nand Busch, noting that he “assumed there would be dramatic changes to our monitoring. I have \npeople above me making plans to distribute water ASAP. I was reluctant before, but after \nlooking at the monitoring schedule and our current staffing, I do not anticipate giving the OK to \nbegin sending water out anytime soon. If water is distributed from this plant in the next couple of \nweeks, it will be against my direction. I need time to adequately train additional staff and to \nupdate our monitoring plans before I will feel we are ready. I will reiterate this to management \nabove me, but they seem to have their own agenda.” \n97.  The rushed nature of the transition to Flint River water is also evident by a request \nmade by Defendant Earley’s assistant to the treasury for a contract to be expedited in order to \nmeet the “aggressive timeline” of the switch. \n98.  On March 26, 2014, Defendant Busch e-mailed Defendant Shekter-Smith and \nanother colleague the following: “One of the things we didn’t get to today that I would like to \nmake sure everyone is on the same page on is what Flint will be required to do in order to start \nusing their plant full time. Because the plant is setup for emergency use, they could startup at any \ntime, but starting up for continuous operation will carry significant changes in regulatory \nrequirements so there is a very gray area as to what we consider for startup.” \n99.  Defendant Ambrose participated in, directed, and/or assented to the decisions to  \n  22 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 23 of 89    Pg ID 23\nterminate DWSD service and begin premature Flint River water service when he served as a \nfinancial advisor to the two Emergency Managers that preceded him. \n100.  On April 24, 2014, Daugherty Johnson, Flint’s Utilities Administrator, sent an \nemail to Howard Croft, Mike Prysby, and Stephen Bush, stating: “As you are aware, the City has \nundergone extensive upgrades to our Water Treatment Plant and its associated facilities. Our \nintentions and efforts have been to operate our facility as the primary drinking water source for \nthe City of Flint. Through consultation with your office and our engineering firm we’ve \ndeveloped a system of redundant electrical systems, treatment processes and adequate finished \nwater storage[.]” \n101.  An April 23, 2014 email from Defendant Busch to Defendant Wurful developed \ntalking points for an upcoming Flint meeting. Among them, Busch offers: “While the \nDepartment is satisfied with the City’s ability to treat water from the Flint River, the Department \nlooks forward to the long term solution of continued operation of the City of Flint Water \nTreatment Plant using water from the KWA as a more consistent and higher quality source \nwater.” \n102.  On April 25, 2014, Flint officially began using the Flint River as its primary water \nsource, despite the fact that the proper preparations had not been made. \n103.  The same day, then Flint Mayor Dayne Walling publically declared “It’s regular, \ngood, pure drinking water, and it’s right in our backyard.” \n104.  Flint DPW Director Howard Croft also stated in a press release that “The test \nresults have shown that our water is not only safe, but of the high quality that Flint customers \nhave come to expect. We are proud of that end result.” \n  23 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 24 of 89    Pg ID 24\n105.  Croft’s statement was made despite Mr. Glasgow’s known concerns regarding the \nfacility’s inadequate preparation and monitoring. \n106.  This April 25, 2014 transition put Flint in the business of water treatment, where \nit had previously only been in the business of water distribution, highlighting the need for proper \ntraining of employees and analysis of water treatment processes. \n107.  Defendant LAN, an engineering firm, was hired to prepare Flint’s water treatment \nplant for the treatment of new water sources, including both the KWA and the Flint River. \n108.  Flint’s water treatment plant had not needed to treat the water received from \nDWSD, as DWSD provided the water in an already treated state. \n109.  Defendant LAN was responsible for providing engineering services to make \nFlint’s inactive water treatment plant sufficient to treat water from each of its new sources. \n110.  Defendant LAN carelessly and negligently failed in its task. Its actions facilitated \nthe transfer of Flint’s water source to river water without the proper treatment.  \n111.  That treatment, necessary to protect against the poisoning of thousands of Flint \nresidents, including Plaintiffs, and would have cost a relatively small amount of money. \n112.  An important consideration any time a water system changes sources is to account \nfor differences in those sources. According to the EPA, “it is critical that public water systems, in \nconjunction with their primacy agencies and, if necessary, outside technical consultants, evaluate \nand address potential impacts resulting from treatment and/or source water changes.” Various \nfactors specific to individual water sources necessitate different treatments, including but not \nlimited to the use of chemical additives. \n113.   Neither the State of Michigan (on its own or through its control over the City of \nFlint), the MDEQ, nor LAN required water quality standards to be set for the Flint River water \n  24 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 25 of 89    Pg ID 25\nthat would be delivered to Flint’s residents. Further, none of them required corrosion control be \nimplemented to ensure that corrosive water was not delivered throughout Flint’s aging water \nsystem. \n114.  The MDEQ, as Flint’s “primacy agency,” was responsible for ensuring that Flint \nset water quality standards and properly treated its water. \n115.  LAN, as Flint’s outside contractor, had a duty to recognize the need for corrosion \ncontrol and advise that it should be implemented. \n116.  The water obtained from the Flint River was substantially more corrosive than the \ntreated water Flint had been receiving from DWSD. \n117.  Water becomes more corrosive when it contains greater quantities of chloride, \nwhich can enter the water from manmade and natural sources.  \n118.  Flint River water is known to contain about 8 times more chloride than the treated \nwater that Flint had been receiving from DWSD. \n119.  It is well known that corrosive water that is not properly treated results in the \ncorrosion of pipes, such that the metals in the pipes will leach into drinking water. \n120.  Phosphates are often added to corrosive water as a method of corrosion control, to \nprevent metals from leaching into the water. \n121.  Incredibly, at the time of the switch to Flint River water, no phosphates were \nbeing added to the water supply. \n122.  In fact, nothing whatsoever was being done to account for the corrosive nature of \nthe Flint River water, despite the clear duties of the City of Flint, the MDEQ, the State as Flint’s \nmanager, and LAN as the consultant. \n  25 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 26 of 89    Pg ID 26\n123.  As a result of the failure to properly treat water from the Flint River, corrosive \nwater was delivered throughout the Flint Water System. \n124.  The corrosive water predictably corroded metal pipes, causing them to leach into \nwater. \n125.  The corrosive nature of the water was almost immediately apparent. Soon after \nthe switch, Flint residents began complaining about discolored water—clearly indicating that \niron or other metals were leaching into the water. \n126.  It is important that a new source of water be properly studied and treated to ensure \nthat its use will not result in the corrosion of pipes in the delivery system. This is particularly \nimportant where portions of the delivery system, included but not limited to service lines, are \nmade of lead. \n127.  An estimated 15,000 of Flint’s 30,000 residential service lines are composed at \nleast partially of lead. \n128.   Setting standards and optimal ranges for water quality is necessary to prevent \nwidespread impacts from substandard or dangerous water. \n129.  Lead is a powerful neurotoxin that can have devastating, irreversible impacts on \nthe development of children. There is no safe level of lead as its effects are harmful even at low  \n130.  Lead exposure in children causes heightened levels of lead in the blood and body, \nresulting in problems including decreased IQ, behavioral problems, hearing impairment, \nimpaired balance and nerve function, infections, skin problems, digestive problems, and \npsychological disorders. Lead also causes serious health effects in adults, including digestive, \ncardiovascular, and reproductive problems, kidney damage, dizziness, fatigue, weakness, \n  26 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 27 of 89    Pg ID 27\ndepression and mood disorders, diminished cognitive performance, nervousness, irritability, and \nlethargy. \n131.  Lead contamination is not the only problem that is caused when corrosive water is \ndistributed in a public water system. \n132.  When water corrodes iron pipes, the iron leaching into the water system can \nconsume chlorine. This can eliminate the chlorine necessary to prevent the growth of \nmicroorganisms that can cause disease. \n133.  With chlorine consumed by iron, the risk of infection by organisms such as \nlegionella increases. \n134.  Corrosion of iron water pipes is obvious when it occurs, as the water appears \ndiscolored. \n135.  The corrosion of iron pipes can also result in an increase in water main leaks and \nbreaks. \n136.  The signs of iron corrosion are a warning sign that lead corrosion may also be \npresent, since both are caused by the same phenomenon. \n137.  Almost immediately after the water source was changed to the Flint River, signs \nof trouble with Flint’s water quality began to surface. \n138.  Within weeks, many residents began to complain about odorous, discolored \nwater. \n139.  As complaints rolled in, Flint Mayor Walling called the water a “safe, quality \nproduct,” and claimed that “people are wasting their precious money buying bottled water.” \n140.  In August and September, 2014, the City of Flint issued two boil water advisories \nafter fecal coliform bacteria was discovered in the water. \n  27 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 28 of 89    Pg ID 28\n141.  On October 13, 2014, General Motors ceased the use of Flint River water at its \nengine plant because of fears that it would cause corrosion due to high levels of chloride. \n142.  Discussing General Motors’ decision, Defendant Prysby wrote to Defendants \nBusch, Shekter-Smith and others that the Flint River water had elevated chloride levels. He \nstated that “although not optimal” the water was “satisfactory.” He noted that he had “stressed \nthe importance of not branding Flint’s water as ‘corrosive’ from a public health standpoint \nsimply because it does not meet a manufacturing facility’s limit for production.” \n143.  In October of 2014, Governor Snyder received a briefing that blamed iron pipes, \nsusceptible to corrosion and bacteria, for the two boil water advisories. \n144.  On January 2, 2015, the City of Flint mailed a notice to its water customers \nindicating that it was in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act due to the presence of \ntrihalomethanes, which was a product of attempting to disinfect the water. It was claimed that the \nwater was safe to drink for most people with healthy immune systems. \n145.  On January 9, 2015, the University of Michigan – Flint discovered lead in campus \ndrinking fountains. \n146.  With the Flint water quality problems now being recognized, on January 12, \n2015, DWSD offered to waive a 4 million dollar reconnection fee to transition back to DWSD \nwater. Defendant Ambrose, as Emergency Manager, declined the offer. \n147.  On January 21, 2015, enraged Flint residents attended a meeting a Flint City hall, \nbringing jugs of discolored water and complaining about the water’s smell and taste. \n148.  As early as January of 2015, the State of Michigan provided purified water \ncoolers at its Flint offices in response to concerns about the drinking water, while State \nemployees continued for many months to tell the general public that the water was safe to drink. \n  28 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 29 of 89    Pg ID 29\n149.  In a January 29, 2015, e-mail to MDEQ deputy director Jim Sygo, Defendant \nShekter-Smith made statements indicating her personal knowledge of the Flint River’s \ncorrosivity. “I’m theorizing here, but most likely what they are seeing is a result of differing \nwater chemistry. A change in water chemistry can sometimes cause more corrosive water to \nslough material off of pipes as opposed to depositing material or coating pipes in the distribution \nsystem. This may continue for a while until things stabilize. It would be unusual for water \nleaving the plant to have color like people are seeing at their taps. Generally this is a distribution \nsystem problem or a premise plumbing issues. Since it appears wide-spread, it’s most likely a \ndistribution system problem.” \n150.  On February 6, 2015, an Emergency Manager staff member wrote to Defendant \nPrysby, described as the MDEQ’s “most knowledgeable staff member on the Flint and Genesee \nCounty water supply issues,” asking whether he knew if MDEQ had ever conducted a “source \nwater assessment” for the Flint River. After an initial response stating that he did not know, \nPrysby later responded that a study on the Flint River as an emergency intake had been \nconducted in 2004. \n151.  The 2004 study noted that the Flint River was a highly sensitive drinking water \nsource that was susceptible to contamination, yet apparently even Defendant Prysby did not \nconsult it before approving the Flint River as a source. \n152.  On February 27, 2015, in response to concerns about extremely high levels of \nlead in a resident’s water sample, Defendant Busch told the EPA on behalf of MDEQ that the \nFlint Water Treatment Plant had an optimized corrosion control program, despite the fact that it \ndid not. \n  29 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 30 of 89    Pg ID 30\n153.   MDEQ was required to know whether Flint had an optimized corrosion control \nprogram, because ensuring the existence of that program was the express responsibility of \nMDEQ. \n154.  MDEQ did, in fact, know that no optimized corrosion control had been \nimplemented, since MDEQ was involved in the decision not to implement corrosion control. \n155.  MDEQ did not require the use of corrosion control, and it did not set water quality \nparameters for the Flint River source water, both of which it was required to do. \n156.  The effect of this inexplicable failure was the exposure of Plaintiffs to poisonous \nwater that caused a wide variety of health effects, including developmental problems in young \nchildren. \n157.  Also on February 27, 2015, the EPA’s regional drinking water regulations \nmanager. Miguel Del Toral, began to voice his concerns about the likely cause of the high lead \nlevels detected in Flint. In an email to Defendant Prysby that date (which was also copied to \nDefendant Busch) Del Toral attributed those levels to particulate lead, which would mean that \nthe MDEQ’s testing methods of “pre-flushing” water from homes would bias samples low. He \nalso inquired about optimized corrosion control, which he noted was required that Flint was \n“required to have” in place. \n158.  At another point in February, 2015, Governor Snyder received a briefing on \nFlint’s water problems from MDEQ director Dan Wyant, which included resident complaints \nabout discolored, low quality tap water, and a letter from a state representative indicating that his \nconstituents were “on the verge of civil unrest.” \n159.  Snyder took no significant action in response to the Flint residents’ pleas. \n  30 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 31 of 89    Pg ID 31\n160.  Around the same time, an MDEQ e-mail explained away “hiccups” in the \ntransition to Flint’s water system, discounting the possibility of imminent threats to public \nhealth, and noting that the switch to the Flint River “put the city in the business of water \nproduction, where they had historically been in the business of water transmission.” It was \nclaimed that “once the city connects to the new KWA system in 2016, this issue will fade into \nthe rearview.” \n161.  The MDEQ e-mail also noted that “MDEQ approved the use of river as a \nsource[.]” \n162.  In early 2015, Defendant Veolia was hired to conduct a review of the City’s water \nquality, largely in response to citizen complaints. Veolia thereafter negligently declared the water \nsafe. \n163.  Veolia’s task was to review Flint’s public water system, including treatment \nprocesses, maintenance procedures, and actions taken. \n164.  As water treatment professionals, Veolia had an opportunity to catch what \nDefendant LAN had missed or refused to warn about—that corrosive water was being pumped \nthrough lead pipes into the homes of Flint residents without any corrosion control. \n165.  Veolia issued an interim report on its findings, which it presented to a committee \nof Flint’s City Council on February 18, 2015. \n166.  In its interim report, Veolia indicated that Flint’s water was “in compliance with \ndrinking water standards.” It also noted that “[s]afe [equals] compliance with state and federal \nstandards and required testing.” \n167.  In other words, Veolia publically declared Flint’s corrosive water, which was \nleaching heavy metals from service lines, safe. \n  31 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 32 of 89    Pg ID 32\n168.  Defendant Veolia’s interim report also noted that the discoloration in Flint’s water \n“raises questions,” but “[d]oesn’t mean the water is unsafe.” \n169.  The interim report noted that among Veolia’s “next steps” were to “carry out \nmore detailed study of initial findings” and “[m]ake recommendations for improving water \nquality.” \n170.  In response to potential questions about “[m]edical problems,” Veolia’s interim \nreport dismissively claimed that “[s]ome people may be sensitive to any water. “ \n171.  Veolia issued its final “Water Quality Report” dated March 12, 2015. \n172.  In the final report, Veolia noted that it had conducted a “160-hour assessment of \nthe water treatment plant, distribution system, customer services and communication programs, \nand capital plans and annual budget.” \n173.  The final report claims that “a review of water quality records for the time period \nunder our study indicates compliance with State and Federal water quality regulations.” \n174.  The final report states that “the public has also expressed its frustration of \ndiscolored and hard water. Those aesthetic issues have understandably increased the level of \nconcern about the safety of the water. The review of the water quality records during the time of \nVeolia’s study shows the water to be in compliance with State and Federal regulations, and based \non those standards, the water is considered to meet drinking water requirements.” \n175.  Specifically addressing the lack of corrosion control, the final report notes that \n“[m]any people are frustrated and naturally concerned by the discoloration of the water with \nwhat primarily appears to be iron from the old unlined cast iron pipes. The water system could \nadd a polyphosphate to the water as a way to minimize the amount of discolored water. \nPolyphosphate addition will not make discolored water issues go away. The system has been \n  32 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 33 of 89    Pg ID 33\nexperiencing a tremendous number of water line breaks the last two winters. Just last week there \nwere more than 14 in one day. Any break, work on broken valves or hydrant flushing will \nchange the flow of water and potentially cause temporary discoloration.” \n176.  Therefore, in addition to missing the connection between the lack of corrosion \ncontrol and lead contamination, Veolia made a permissive “could” suggestion aimed only at \nreducing aesthetic deficiencies while suggesting that Flint’s drinking water met all applicable \nrequirements and was safe to drink. \n177.  As a result of Veolia’s actions, Plaintiffs continued to be exposed to poisonous \nwater beyond February and March of 2015. \n178.  As evidence of problems mounted, the state and the MDEQ repeatedly denied the \ndangers facing Flint’s residents, insisting that their water was safe to drink. \n179.  On March 23-24, 2015, Flint’s powerless City Council voted 7-1 to end Flint \nRiver service and return to DWSD. Defendant Ambrose declared that vote “incomprehensible” \nand rejected the proposal. \n180.  Defendant Ambrose then publically declared that “Flint water today is safe by all \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and Michigan Department of Environmental Quality \nstandards, and the city is working daily to improve its quality... water from Detroit is no safer \nthan water from Flint.” \n181.  On April 24, 2015, the MDEQ finally admitted to the EPA that Flint did not have \noptimized corrosion control in place, expressly contradicting its statement from two months \nprior. \n  33 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 34 of 89    Pg ID 34\n182.  By no later than April 2015, but likely much earlier, Defendants Cook, Busch, \nand Prysby were undeniably aware that no corrosion control was being used in Flint following \nthe switch to the Flint River as the water source.. \n183.  The MDEQ, Defendants Cook, Busch, and Prysby also knew that at least one \nEPA employee (EPA Region 5 groundwater and drinking water regulations manager, Miguel Del \nToral (“Del Toral”)) disagreed with their assertion that the MDEQ was adhering to EPA \nrequirements in its oversight of Flint’s compliance with the LCR. \n184.  The flawed interpretation used by MDEQ and its employees amounted to a one \nyear “free pass” for the system, during which Flint’s residents would be used as guinea pigs to \nsee whether they should have been protected in the first place. \n185.  The MDEQ, Defendants Cook, Busch, and Prysby were expressly told by Del \nToral that their sampling procedures skewed lead level results and did not properly account for \nthe presence of lead service lines. \n186.  In April 2015, Del Toral issued a memorandum to the MDEQ, stating: “I wanted \nto follow up on this because Flint has essentially not been using any corrosion control treatment \nsince April 30, 2014, and they have (lead service lines). Given the very high lead levels found at \none home and the pre-flushing happening in Flint, I’m worried that the whole town may have \nmuch higher lead levels than the compliance results indicated, since they are using pre-flushing \nahead of their compliance sampling.” \n187.  Del Toral, a national expert in the field, identified the problem, the cause of that \nproblem, and the specific reason the state had missed it. Defendants ignored and dismissed him. \n188.  MDEQ’s director, Defendant Wyant, was expressly aware of Del Toral’s \ncomments and concerns. \n  34 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 35 of 89    Pg ID 35\n189.  On May 1, 2015, Defendant Cook sent an email to Del Toral disagreeing with Del  \nToral’s interpretation of his own agency’s rules and vehemently resisting calls for a water \nquality. Cook noted that “[a]s Flint will be switching raw water sources in just over one year \nfrom now, raw water quality will be completely different than what they currently use. Requiring \na study at the current time will be of little to no value in the long term control of these chronic \ncontaminants.” \n190.  Apparently, Defendant Cook and the MDEQ believed they could simply run out \nthe clock on Flint’s water quality problem, in conscious disregard for the safety of the public, \nincluding Plaintiffs, as the water source would be changing in the near future \n191.  Cook also falsely claimed that “the City of Flint’s sampling protocols for lead and \ncopper monitoring comply with all current state and federal requirements. Any required \nmodifications will be implemented at a time when such future regulatory requirements take \neffect. \n192.  While Cook attempted to defend himself and the MDEQ, he completely ignored \nDel Toral’s well founded concerns that the MDEQ was missing lead in Flint’s public drinking \nwater. Instead, he was focused on insisting that the MDEQ had technically complied with \napplicable rules. It had not. \n193.  On June 24, 2015, Del Toral authored an alarming memorandum to Thomas Poy, \nthe chief of the EPA’s Region 5 Ground Water and Drinking Water Branch, more fully stating \nhis concerns about the problems with MDEQ’s oversight of Flint (the “Memorandum”). \n194.  Del Toral’s Memorandum noted that Flint was not providing corrosion control \ntreatment for mitigating lead and copper levels, “[a] major concern from a public health \nstandpoint.”  Further, “[r]ecent drinking water sample results indicate the presence of high lead \n  35 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 36 of 89    Pg ID 36\nresults in the drinking water, which is to be expected in a public water system that is not \nproviding corrosion control treatment. The lack of any mitigating treatment for lead is of serious \nconcern for residents that live in homes with lead service lines or partial lead service lines, which \nare common throughout the City of Flint.” \n195.  The Memorandum additionally noted that, “[t]he lack of mitigating treatment is \nespecially concerning as the high lead levels will likely not be reflected in the City of Flint’s \ncompliance samples due to the sampling procedures used by the City of Flint for collecting \ncompliance samples... . This is a serious concern as the compliance sampling results which are \nreported by the City of Flint to residents could provide a false sense of security to the residents of \nFlint regarding lead levels in their water and may result in residents not taking necessary \nprecautions to protect their families from lead in the drinking water . . . [o]ur concern . . . has \nbeen raised with the [MDEQ].” \n196.  Del Toral’s Memorandum also noted that a Flint resident, Ms. Lee-Anne Walters, \nwho had directly contacted the EPA had alarming results of 104 ug/L and 397 ug/L1, especially \nalarming given the flawed sampling procedures used by the MDEQ. The MDEQ had told the \nresident that the lead was coming from the plumbing in her own home, but Del Toral’s \ninspection revealed that her plumbing was entirely plastic. \n197.  The memorandum also noted blood tests showed Ms. Walters’s child had elevated \nblood lead levels, and that additional sample results from resident-requested samples showed \nhigh levels of lead. \n198.  Among those cc’d on the Memorandum were Defendants Liane Shekter-Smith, \nPatrick Cook, Stephen Busch, and Michael Prysby. \n  36 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 37 of 89    Pg ID 37\n199.  On May 11, 2015, Jon Allan, director of the Michigan Office of the Great Lakes, \ne-mailed Defendant Shekter-Smith for her reactions to the following language in a proposed \nreport “By 2020, 98 percent of population served by community water systems is provided \ndrinking water that meets all health-based standards... By 2020, 90 percent of the non-\ncommunity water systems provide drinking water that meets all health-based standards.” \nResponding the same day, MDEQ Water Resources Division Chief William Creal replied: “I \nthink you are nuts if you go with a goal less than 100 percent for (drinking water) compliance in \nthe strategy. How many Flints to you intend to allow???” \n200.  Defendant Shekter-Smith responded the next day: “The balance here is between \nwhat is realistic and what is ideal. Of course, everyone wants 100 percent compliance. The \nreality, however, is that it’s impossible. It’s not that we ‘allow’ a Flint to occur; circumstances \nhappen. Water mains break, systems lose pressure, bacteria gets into the system, regulations \nchange and systems that were in compliance no longer are, etc. Do we want to put goal in black \nand white that cannot be met but sounds good? Or do we want to establish a goal that challenges \nus but can actually be accomplished? Perhaps there’s a middle ground?” \n201.  Defendant Shekter-Smith’s May 12, 2015 email comments reflect her obvious \nawareness at that time that Flint’s water did not meet health based standards, and her callous \n“circumstances happen” statement demonstrated her deliberate indifference to the results. \n202.  In approximately July 2015, Defendant Busch claimed that “almost all” homes in \nthe pool sampled for lead in Flint had lead service lines. This was patently untrue and was made \nwith no basis in fact, and the effect of this mistake made the lead testing results even more \nunreliable. Busch knew that this statement was not true, because Flint’s records available at that \ntime were insufficient to allow him to make such a determination. \n  37 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 38 of 89    Pg ID 38\n203.  On July 9, 2015 ACLU-Michigan reporter Curt Guyette publicly broke the story \nabout lead in Flint’s drinking water, citing Del Toral’s Memorandum and exposing the lack of \ncorrosion control in Flint’s drinking water. \n204.  Four days later, Defendant Wurfel issued the following public statement: “Let me \nstart here- anyone who is concerned about lead in the drinking water in Flint can relax.” \n205.  On July 21, 2015, the EPA and MDEQ conducted a conference call regarding \nMDEQ’s implementation of the LCR. EPA pushed for optimized corrosion control (which \nMDEQ had previously falsely told the EPA that Flint was using), while MDEQ claimed it was \nunnecessary and premature. \n206.  MDEQ could not have been more wrong. Far from being premature, it was \nalready too late to fully protect the people of Flint. \n207.  In an e-mail follow-up to that call, sent to an EPA employee, Defendant Shekter- \nSmith stated “while we understand your concerns with the overall implementation of the lead \nand copper rule (the “LCR”); we think it is appropriate for EPA to indicate in writing (an email \nwould be sufficient) your concurrence that the city is in compliance with the lead and copper rule \nas implemented in Michigan... This would help distinguish between our goals to address \nimportant public health issues separately from the compliance requirements of the actual rule \nwhich we believe have been and continue to be met in the city of Flint.” \n208.  Defendant Shekter-Smith’s statement indicates that she and the MDEQ were more \nconcerned about proving technical compliance with the LCR than “address[ing] important public \nhealth issues.” \n209.  Again, Defendant Shekter-Smith statements demonstrate a deliberate indifference \nto whether an injury resulted to Flint’s residents, including Plaintiffs. \n  38 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 39 of 89    Pg ID 39\n210.  On July 22, 2015, Governor Snyder’s chief of staff, Dennis Muchmore, sent an \nemail indicating his awareness of the problems with Flint’s water and the state’s inadequate \nresponse. He noted: “I’m frustrated by the water issue in Flint. I really don’t think people are \ngetting the benefit of the doubt. Now they are concerned and rightfully so about the lead level \nstudies they are receiving from DEQ samples. Can you take a moment out of your impossible \nschedule to personally take a look at this? These folks are scared and worried about the health \nimpacts and they are basically getting blown off by us (as a state we’re just not sympathizing \nwith their plight).” \n211.  Linda Dykema, director of the MDHHS Division of Environmental Health sent an \nemail to a number of department employees attempting to discredit Del Toral, who to this point \nwas the only government employee actively trying to protect Flint’s residents, including \nPlaintiffs, from lead poisoning. She claimed “[r]egarding the EPA drinking water official quoted \nin the press articles, the report that he issued was a result of his own research and was not \nreviewed or approved by EPA management. He has essentially acted outside his authority.” \n212.  On July 24, 2015, Defendant Wurfel wrote an e-mail to Defendants Busch, \nPrysby, Shekter-Smith and Wyant, stating: “Guys, the Flint Ministers met with the Governor’s \noffice again last week. They also brought along some folks from the community – a college prof \nand GM engineer – who imparted that 80 water tests in Flint have shown high lead levels. Could \nuse an update on the January/June testing results, as well as recap of the December testing \nnumbers, and any overview you can offer to edify this conversation.” \n213.  Defendant Busch responded the same day in email to Defendant Wurfel copied to \nall others on the original e-mail, claiming that the second round of Flint drinking water testing \n showed a 90th percentile level of 11 parts per billion, almost double the prior round’s results.  \n  39 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 40 of 89    Pg ID 40\n214.  Even with MDEQ’s terribly flawed sampling methods showing that lead levels \nhad nearly doubled since the first six month testing, and even with outside evidence of even \nhigher levels, Defendants showed no concern and took no immediate action to protect the people \nof Flint, including Plaintiffs.  \n215.  Defendant Busch also noted in his e-mail that Flint would be completing “a study \n(within 18 months) and are allowed a period of additional time (2 additional years) to install the \nselected treatment for fully optimized corrosion control. \n216.  MDEQ and its employees would have allowed the continued poisoning of Flint’s \nresidents, including Plaintiffs, over three more years without even attempting to reduce the \nwater’s corrosiveness. \n217.  On July 24, 2015, Defendant Wurfel wrote the following to recipients including \nMr. Muchmore and Defendant Wyant: “Guys, here’s an update and some clarification on the \nlead situation in Flint. Please limit this information to internal for now...By the tenants of the \nfederal statute, the city is in compliance for lead and copper. That aside, they have not optimized \ntheir water treatment... Conceivably, by the time we’re halfway through the first timeline, the \ncity will begin using a new water source with KWA... and conceivably, the whole process starts \nall over again. In terms of near-future issues, the bottom line is that residents of Flint do not need \nto worry about lead in their water supply, and DEQ’s recent sampling does not indicate an \neminent [sic] health threat from lead or copper.” \n218.  In August, 2015, the EPA pressed MDEQ to move faster on implementing \ncorrosion control in Flint. \n219.  On August 23, 2015, Virginia Tech Professor Marc Edwards wrote MDEQ to \ninform them that he would be conducting a study of Flint’s water quality. \n  40 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 41 of 89    Pg ID 41\n220.  On August 27, 2015, Professor Edwards’s preliminary analysis was released. \nMore than half of the first 48 samples he tested came back above 5 ppb, and more than 30% of \nthem came back over 15ppb, which would be unacceptable even as a 90th percentile. He called \nthe results “worrisome.” \n221.  In an e-mail response to a Governor’s office inquiry regarding the high lead levels \nin residents’ homes and the discrepancy between those numbers and the state’s test results, \nDefendant Wurfel stated “[d]on’t know what it is, but I know what it’s not. The key to lead and \ncopper in drinking water is that it’s not the source water, or even the transmission lines (most of \nwhich are cast iron). It’s in the premise plumbing (people’s homes).” \n222.  This statement was made despite the facts that about half of Flint’s homes are \nconnected to lead service lines, and that it was clear by this point that Ms. Walters’s home had \nplastic plumbing. \n223.  Wurfel then blamed Del Toral, the ACLU, and others taking action to help Flint’s \nresidents, stating: “This person is the one who had EPA lead specialist come to her home and do \ntests, then released an unvetted draft of his report (that EPA apologized to us profusely for) to the \nresident, who shared it with ACLU, who promptly used it to continue raising hell with the \nlocals... [I]t’s been rough sledding with a steady parade of community groups keeping everyone \nhopped-up and misinformed.” \n224.  On August 28, 2015, an EPA employee notified Defendant Shekter-Smith and \nother MDEQ employees that “Marc Edwards (Virginia Tech) is working with some of the \ncitizens in Flint and they are finding lead at levels above five parts per billion and some above 15 \nparts per billion. There’s no indication of whether any of these homes were also sampled and \n  41 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 42 of 89    Pg ID 42\nanalyzed by Flint and will now be part of their compliance calculations. Virginia Tech sent out \n300 bottles and have gotten 48 back. We are not involved in this effort by Dr. Edwards.” \n225.  On September 2, 2015, Defendant Wurfel engaged in further efforts to discredit \nMarc Edwards, this time in a press release. He stated: “[W]e want to be very clear that the lead \nlevels being detected in Flint drinking water are not coming from the treatment plant or the city’ \ntransmission lines... The issue is how, or whether, and to what extent the drinking water is \ninteracting with lead plumbing in people’s homes....the results reported so far fail to track with \nany of the lead sampling conducted by the city. In addition, Virginia Tech results are not \nreflected by the blood lead level testing regularly conducted by the state department of \ncommunity health that have not shown any change since Flint switched sources.” \n226.  Defendant Wurfel knew this statement to be false, or had no reason to believe that \nit was true. For example, it was obvious by this point that Ms. Walters’s home had plastic \nplumbing. \n227.  On September 6, 2015, another Wurfel attempt to discredit Edwards’s results was \npublished through Michigan Public Radio: “The samples don’t match the testing that we’ve been \ndoing in the same kind of neighborhoods all over the city for the past year. With these kinds of \nnumbers, we would have expected to be seeing a spike somewhere else in the other lead \nmonitoring that goes on in the community.” \n228.  Tragically, had the MDEQ or MDHHS been doing their jobs, they would indeed \nhave seen spikes in all other forms of lead monitoring. Even worse, the MDEQ had been told \nexactly why its testing failed to reveal extremely high levels of lead. \n229.  Dr. Edwards published a report in early September, 2015, with startling findings. \nAmong them: “FLINT HAS A VERY SERIOUS LEAD IN WATER PROBLEM”; “101 out of \n  42 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 43 of 89    Pg ID 43\n252 water samples from Flint homes had first draw lead more than 5 ppb”; “Flint’s 90th \npercentile lead value is 25 parts per billion... over the EPA allowed level of 15ppb that is applied \nto high risk homes... How is it possible that Flint ‘passed’ the official EPA Lead and Copper \nRule sampling overseen by MDEQ?”; “Several samples exceeded 100ppb and one sample \ncollected after 45 seconds of flushing exceeded 1,000 ppb[.].” \n230.  Additional Edwards findings included that “[o]n average, Detroit water is 19 \ntimes less corrosive than the Flint River water currently in use”; “even with phosphate, Flint \nRiver water has 16 times more lead compared to the same condition using Detroit water.” \n231.  Therefore, the Flint River water was so corrosive that even the obvious, necessary \nmeasure of adding corrosion control may not have been enough to make it totally safe \n232.  This would have been known if the water were properly treated or studied before \nthe switch. Instead, by and through the actions of Defendants herein, the residents of Flint, \nincluding Plaintiffs, were used as guinea pigs in a “test then treat” scenario that ensured at least \none year of absolutely no protection from lead contamination. \n233.  Edwards predicted that “in the weeks and months ahead MDEQ and Flint will be \nforced to admit they failed to protect public health as required under the Federal Lead and \nCopper Rule.” He was entirely correct. \n234.  Another scurrilous attack by Defendant Wurfel on Professor Edwards and his \nteam occurred on September 9, 2015, when Wurfel told a reporter: “[T]he state DEQ is just as \nperplexed by Edwards’s results as he seems to be by the city’s test results, which are done \naccording to state and federal sampling guidelines and analyzed by certified labs.” \n  43 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 44 of 89    Pg ID 44\n235.  This statement by Defendant Wurfel was made with full knowledge that at least \none EPA employee had told MDEQ that its testing was not being conducted according to federal \nguidelines. \n236.  Defendant Wurfel also claimed that Professor Edwards’ team “only just arrived in \ntown and (have) quickly proven the theory they set out to prove, and while the state appreciates \nacademic participation in this discussion, offering broad, dire public health advice based on some \nquick testing could be seen as fanning political flames irresponsibly.” \n237.  Again, Wurfel and MDEQ publically attempt to discredit the people working to \nprotect the public, including Plaintiffs, while providing false assurances to Flint’s residents, \nincluding Plaintiffs, about the water that continues to poison them. \n238.  On September 10, 2015, Dr. Yanna Lambrinidou, a member of the EPA National \nDrinking Water Advisory Council Lead and Copper Rule workgroup wrote to Defendants \nWurfel and Busch, requesting information on “optimal water quality parameter ranges” that \nMDEQ should have set for Flint’s water. However, no such information existed, because MDEQ \nhad never created it. \n239.  Busch responded “[a]ll previous water quality parameter ranges would have been \nestablished for the City of Flint’s wholesale finished water supplier, the Detroit Water and \nSewerage Department, not the City of Flint itself. As the City of Flint has not yet established \noptimized corrosion control treatment, the MDEQ is not yet at the point of regulatory \nrequirements where the range of water quality parameters would be set.” \n240.  Water quality parameter ranges ensure safe levels of things like PH, nitrates, and \nphosphates. \n  44 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 45 of 89    Pg ID 45\n241.  Dr. Lambrinidou replied “Do you mean that MDEQ never set optimal water \nquality parameter ranges specifically for Flint before Flint’s switch to Flint River water? It is my \nimpression, please correct me if I’m wrong, that under the LCR, all large systems – whether they \nare consecutive or not – must have optimal water quality parameter ranges designated by states \nspecifically for them (at the time when these systems are deemed to have optimized their \ntreatment). Is there language in the LCR I am missing that allows a utility not to have optimal \nquality parameter ranges established specifically for it? My second question is this: If the City of \nFlint had no optimal water quality parameter ranges established specifically for it in the past, \nhow did it achieve LCR compliance? Isn’t it the case that utility-specific optimal water quality \nparameter ranges (and maintenance of these ranges) are required for all large systems to avoid an \nLCR violation?” \n242.  Busch’s response reiterated his contention that Flint was not required to \nimplement corrosion control until unacceptably high levels of lead had already appeared in the \nwater. This callous response, on September 25, 2015, indicated Busch’s deliberate indifference \nto the health and welfare of Flint’s residents, including Plaintiffs. \n243.  A September 10 e-mail from the EPA’s Jennifer Crooks to Defendant Shekter-\nSmith, summarizing an apparent EPA-DEQ conference call, acknowledged that Professor \nEdwards’s study “[was] putting added pressure on MDEQ, and EPA to ensure that Flint \naddresses their lack of optimized corrosion control treatment in an expedited manner in order to \nprotect the residents from exposure to high lead levels.” Further, “EPA acknowledged that to \ndelay installation of corrosion control treatment in Flint would likely cause even higher levels of \nlead over time as Flint’s many lead service lines are continuously in contact with corrosive \nwater.” \n  45 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 46 of 89    Pg ID 46\n244.  In a September 17, 2015 letter, Defendant Wyant wrote a letter in response to an \ninquiry from various legislators, disavowing any responsibility for reacting to Del Toro’s alarm-\nsounding Memorandum: “With respect to the draft memo referenced in your letter, the MDEQ \ndoes not review or receive draft memos from the USEPA, nor would we expect to while it is a \ndraft. \n245.  Wyant’s statement was made despite the fact that he and the MDEQ were fully \naware of Del Toral’s Memorandum and the concerns it raised, and as though this apparent \nMDEQ policy justified ignoring Del Toral. \n246.  On September 15, 2015, MLive published an article entitled “Virginia Tech \nprofessor says Flint’s tests for lead in water can’t be trusted.” Edwards is quoted as \nrecommending a return to DWSD, stating “Flint is the only city in America that I’m aware of \nthat does not have a corrosion control plan in place to stop this kind of problem.” \n247.  On September 23, 2015, an e-mail from Defendant Croft to numerous officials \nincluded the following: “I am pleased to report that the City of Flint has officially returned to \ncompliance with the Michigan Safe Drinking Water Act and we have received confirming \ndocumentation from the DEQ today...Recent testing has raised questions regarding the amount of \nlead that is being found in the water and I wanted to report to you our current status. At the onset \nof our plant design, optimization for lead was addressed and discussed with the engineering firm \nand with the DEQ. It was determined that having more data was advisable prior to the \ncommitment of a specific optimization method. Most chemicals used in this process are \nphosphate based and phosphate can be a ‘food’ for bacteria. We have performed over one \nhundred and sixty lead tests throughout the city since switching over to the Flint River and \nremain within EPA standards.” \n  46 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 47 of 89    Pg ID 47\n248.  Defendant Croft’s statement was made despite his knowledge that the samples the \ncity had taken were insufficient to draw any conclusions \n249.  Defendant Croft’s widely disseminated message makes no mention of the flawed \nlead testing results. \n250.  On September 25, 2015, Snyder Chief of Staff Dennis Muchmore sent an e-mail \nto Governor Snyder and others that treated the situation in Flint as a political inconvenience \ninstead of a humanitarian crisis. He stated: “The DEQ and [MDHHS] feel that some in Flint are \ntaking the very sensitive issue of children’s exposure to lead and trying to turn it into a political \nfootball claiming the departments are underestimating the impacts on the populations and are \nparticularly trying to shift responsibility to the state...I can’t figure out why the state is \nresponsible except that Dillon did make the ultimate decision so we’re not able to avoid the \nsubject. The real responsibility rests with the County, city, and KWA[.]” \n251.  In addition to ignoring the fact that the state had taken over Flint, Muchmore’s \nevasion of state responsibility ignores the role of the MDEQ and MDHHS in this crisis. \n252.  Where MDEQ caused, obscured, and lied about the lead problem, MDHHS \nshould have discovered and revealed it. \n253.   Instead, the MDHHS obscured, obfuscated, and intentionally withheld \ninformation which conclusively showed that the children of Flint were being poisoned. It took \nthe work of an outside doctor to force MDHHS to acknowledge its failures. \n254.  While MDEQ ignored and criticized the very people it should have been \ngratefully listening to in Del Toral and Dr. Edwards, the MDHHS extended the same treatment \nto Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, a pediatrician at Flint’s Hurley Hospital. \n  47 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 48 of 89    Pg ID 48\n255.  In a July 28, 2015, email from MDHHS epidemiologist Cristin Larder to MDHHS \nemployees Nancy Peeler and Patricia McKane, Larder identifies an increase in blood lead levels \nin Flint just after the switch to river water, and concludes only that the issue “warrant[s] further \ninvestigation.”  \n256.  On the same day, Nancy Peeler sent an e-mail admitting an uptick in children \nwith elevated blood lead levels in Flint in July, August, and September 2014, but attributing it to \nseasonal variation. \n257.  MDHHS took no actions as outsiders began to discover and reveal Flint’s lead \nproblem. Instead, it withheld data and obstructed those researchers while actively attempting to \nrefute their findings. \n258.  In a September 10, 2015, e-mail from MDHSS health educator Michelle Bruneau \nto colleague Kory Groestch, regarding a talking points memorandum, she states: “[M]ay be a \ngood time to float the draft out to the others because if we’re going to take action it needs to be \nsoon before the Virginia Tech University folks scandalize us all.” \n259.  Again, instead of acting to help the people of Flint, including Plaintiffs, the State \nand its employees were concerned with protecting themselves. \n260.  In a September 11, 2015, e-mail to Linda Dykema and Kory Groestch of the \nMDHHS, Defendant Shekter-Smith wrote: “Since we last spoke, there’s been an increase in the \nmedia regarding lead exposure. Any progress developing a proposal for a lead education \ncampaign? We got a number of legislative inquiries that we are responding to. It would be \nhelpful to have something more to say.” DHHS’s Bruneau responded to Groetsch: “Told ya,” \nand incredibly, includes a “smiley face” emoticon. \n  48 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 49 of 89    Pg ID 49\n261.  Groetsch then responds to Shekter-Smith that Bruneau has written only “the \nbones” of a health education and outreach plan. \n262.  The same day, Robert Scott, the data manager for the MDHHS Healthy Homes \nand Lead Prevention program, was e-mailed a copy of a grant proposal for Professor Edwards’s \nstudy Edwards’s grant proposal described a “perfect storm” of “out of control” corrosion of city \nwater pipes leading to “severe chemical/biological health risks for Flint residents.” Scott \nforwarded the grant proposal to MDHHS employees Nancy Peeler, Karen Lishinski, and Wesley \nPriem, with the note“[w]hen you have a few minutes, you might want to take a look at it. Sounds \nlike there might be more to this than what we learned previously. Yikes!” \n263.  On September 22, 2015, MDHHS Environmental Public Health Director Lynda \nDykema, emailed MDHHS’ Geralyn and Defendant Peeler, among others. She stated: “Here is a \nlink to the VA Tech study re city of Flint drinking water... It appears that the researchers have \ncompleted testing of a lot of water samples and the results are significantly different than the city \nand DEQ data. It also appears that they’ve held public meetings in Flint, resulting in concerns \nabout the safety of the water that have arisen in the last few days.”  \n264.  On the same day, Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha requested from Robert Scott and \nothers at MDHHS full state records on blood tests, likely to compare to her own data. She notes \n“[s]ince we have been unable to obtain recent MCIR blood lead data for Flint kids in response to \nthe lead in water concerns, we looked at all the blood lead levels that were processed through \nHurley Medical Center[.]” She tells the MDHHS that despite being denied data access from the \nstate, she has found “striking results.”  \n265.  Dr. Hanna-Attisha had heard complaints from Flint residents about their water \nand found out that no corrosion control was being used. She developed a study using her \n  49 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 50 of 89    Pg ID 50\nhospital’s data, comparing lead levels in blood samples taken before and after the switch in the \nwater supply. \n266.  On September 24, 2015, Dr. Hanna-Attisha released a study showing post-water-\ntransition elevated blood-lead levels in Flint children at a press conference. Dr. Hanna-Attisha \nhad essentially done the job that the MDHHS should have done. \n267.   Earlier that day, MDHSS employee Angela Minicuci circulated a memorandum \nof “Flint Talking Points” in anticipation of Dr. Hanna-Attisha’s study. It noted that her results \nwere “under review” by MDHHS, but that her methodology was different, implying that her  \nmethodology was unorthodox or improper. “Looking at the past five years as a whole provides a \nmuch more accurate look at the season trends of lead in the area,” MDHHS claimed. “MDHHS  \ndata provides a much more robust picture of the entire blood lead levels for the Flint area.” \n268.  Also regarding Dr. Hanna-Attisha’s findings, Governor Snyder’s press secretary \ne-mailed a number of state employees the following: “Team, [h]ere’s the data that will be \npresented at the Hurley Hospital press conference at 3 p.m. As you’ll see, they are pointing to \nindividual children, a very emotional approach. Our challenge will be to show how our state data \nis different from what the hospital and the coalition members are presenting today.” \n269.  Here again, the State and the individual Defendants in this action were more \nconcerned about protecting their own respective reputations than the lives of Flint residents, \nincluding Plaintiffs. It never addressed the most important-- and obvious question-- what if Dr. \nHanna Attisha was right? \n270.  MDHHS employees were uniformly dismissive of Dr. Hanna-Attisha’s results. \nWesley Priem, manager of the MDHHS Healthy Homes Section, wrote to MDHHS’ Kory \nGroetsch: “This is definitely being driven by a little science and a lot of politics.” \n  50 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 51 of 89    Pg ID 51\n271.  The same day the results were released, Robert Scott emailed Nancy Peeler, \nnoting that he had tried to “recreate Hurley’s numbers,” and says he sees “a difference between \nthe two years, but not as much difference as they did.” Despite the fact that this constitutes \nMDHHS’s first internal recognition that their own methodology could have been wrong and that \nFlint children had been poisoned, Scott added “I’m sure this one is not for the public.” \n272.  As this was going on, Professor Edwards forcefully requested blood lead data \nfrom Mr. Scott. In an email, the Professor notes that the State had failed to provide the records to \nDr. Hanna-Attisha’s team, and accusing the MDHHS of “raising...obstacles to sharing it with \neveryone who asks.” Professor Edwards claims to have been requesting the data since August, \nand notes that he has sent Scott ten e-mails on the subject. \n273.  The next day, Scott drafted a remarkable response, but never sent it to Professor \nEdwards on the advice of Defendant Peeler. Included in the would-be response: “I worked with \nyou earlier this month to get data to you relatively quickly but did not manage to complete the \nprocess before I went on annual leave for several days. I neglected to inform you that I’d be \naway, and I apologize for not informing you.” \n274.   Despite the fact that Scott admitted to going on vacation and leaving an important \ntask unfinished as a public health crisis unfolded, Peeler tells him to “apologize less.” \n275.  The day after Dr. Hanna-Attisha releases her study, the City of Flint issues a \nhealth advisory, telling residents to flush pipes and install filters to prevent lead poisoning. \n276.  The same day, Robert Scott responded to an email from colleagues about Detroit \nFree Press interest in doing a lead story. At 12:16 p.m., Free Press reporter Kristi Tanner sent an \nemail to Angela Minicuci at MDHHS saying Tanner had looked at the lead increase in Flint as \n  51 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 52 of 89    Pg ID 52\nshown in DHS records between 2013-2014 and 2-14-2015 and Tanner is concluding that the \nincrease “is statistically significant.”  \n277.  Scott writes to Minicuci: “The best I could say is something like this: ‘While the \ntrend for Michigan as a whole has shown a steady decrease in lead poisoning year by year, \nsmaller areas such as the city of Flint have their bumps from year to year while still trending \ndownward overall.’” \n278.  Nancy Peeler, also a party to the conversation, writes back to Scott and Minicuci: \n“My secret hope is that we can work in the fact that this pattern is similar to the recent past.” \n279.  This conversation unfolded the very day after Scott told Peeler that his own \nreview of the data showed increased post-switch lead levels, but that his findings were not to be \nmade public. \n280.  Peeler and Scott intentionally withheld information that they had a duty to \ndisclose to the public, and actively sought to hide the lead poisoning epidemic that they had \npreviously failed to discover. \n281.  Also on September 25, MDHHS’s Lasher sent an email to Mr. Muchmore, \nDefendant Wyant, Defendant Wufel, and others, repeating criticisms of Dr. Hanna-Attisha’s \nfindings using quotation marks in reference to the “data” that she reviewed and calling her \nsample size into question. \n282.  Those MDHHS employees not actively engaged in the cover-up showed no \nurgency whatsoever to this public health crisis. Cristin Larder sent an e-mail to a number of \ncolleagues: “After looking at the data Kristi send you and talking with Sarah, I realize I do not \nhave access to the data I need to answer her specific question about significance. I won’t be able \n  52 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 53 of 89    Pg ID 53\nto get access before Monday. Sorry I wasn’t able to be helpful right now.” Angela Minicuci \nresponded: “Not a problem, let’s connect on Monday.”  \n283.  The MDHHS apparently could not be troubled with an ongoing public health \nemergency on the weekend. \n284.  As this crisis unfolded, Governor Snyder received briefings from Mr. Muchmore, \nwhich were more focused on political reputation preservation than helping the people of Flint, \nincluding Plaintiffs. \n285.  Muchmore referred to the people raising concerns about Flint’s lead as the “anti \neverything group,” and claimed that it was the responsibility of the City of Flint (overtaken by \nSnyder’s Emergency Manager) to “deal with it.” Still, by September 26, 2015, Muchmore had \ntold the governor that finding funds “to buy local residents home filters is really a viable option,” \nand had identified service lines to homes as a likely cause of the problem. \n286.  The Governor took no immediate action to protect the rights, health, and safety of \nFlint’s residents while his subordinates continued to insist that the water was safe and discredit \nthose who presented evidence to the contrary. \n287.  On September 28, 2015, another incredible Defendant Wurfel public statement \nwas released. He claimed that the Flint situation is turning into “near hysteria,” and saying of Dr. \nHanna-Attisha’s statements “I wouldn’t call them irresponsible. I would call them unfortunate.” \nHe again declares Flint’s water safe. \n288.  On September 28, 2015, State Senator Jim Ananich sent a letter to Governor \nSnyder, noting “[i]t is completely unacceptable that respected scientific experts and our trusted \nlocal physicians have verified that the City of Flint’s drinking water is dangerous for our citizens, \n  53 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 54 of 89    Pg ID 54\nespecially our most vulnerable young people.” He called for immediate action, but the Governor \ncontinued to wait. \n289.  The same day, MDHHS Director Nick Lyon continues trying to discredit Dr. \nHanna-Attisha’s study despite his own department’s knowledge that it shows a real problem. In \nan e-mail, he stated: “I need an analysis of the Virginia Tech/Hurley data and their conclusions. I \nwould like to make a strong statement with a demonstration of proof that the lead blood levels \nseen are not out of the ordinary and are attributable to seasonal fluctuations. Geralyn is working \non this for me but she needs someone in public health who can work directly with her on \nimmediate concerns/questions.” \n290.  Incredibly, and in blatant violation of state law, at all relevant times the state’s \n“top doctor,” MDHHS chief medical executive Dr. Eden Wells was attending to her \nresponsibilities part time while also working at the University of Michigan. Dr. Wells did not \nbecome a full time state employee until February 1, 2016, and her mandatory responsibilities at \nthe state prior to that time may have involved as little as eight (8) hours per week. \n291.  Dr. Wells was the sole medical doctor working as an executive for the \ndepartment. \n292.  Dr. Wells’s predecessor, Dr. Gregory Holtzman, has noted that as a full time \nemployee,he “kept quite busy.” \n293.  Other outsiders continued to put pressure on the MDHHS to be more transparent.  \n294.  Genesee County Health Officer Mark Valacak wrote an e-mail to department \nemployees, demanding “to know whether you have confirmed with the lead program staff at \nMDHHS that he state results that purport that lead levels have not shown a significant increase \nsince the changeover of the water supply for the city of Flint indeed represent Flint city zip codes \n  54 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 55 of 89    Pg ID 55\nonly and not Flint mailing addresses. As I mentioned to you both this morning, Flint mailing \naddresses include outlying areas like Flint and Mundy Townships which obtain their water from \nthe Detroit water authority.”  \n295.  Valacak’s email pointed out further flaws in MDHHS methodology. \n296.  In the face of continued state denials, a September 29, 2015, article in the Detroit \nFree Press publically claimed “Data that the State of Michigan released last week to refute a \nhospital researcher’s claim that an increasing number of Flint children have been lead-poisoned \nsince the city switched its water supply actually supports the hospital’s findings, a Free Press \nanalysis has shown. Worse, prior to the water supply change, the number of lead-poisoned kids \nin Flint, and across the state, had been dropping; the reversal of that trend should prompt state \npublic health officials to examine a brewing public health crisis.” \n297.  Dr. Hanna-Attisha could see the problem and the Free Press could see the \nproblem with the state’s own data, and yet the MDHHS found signs of a lead problem but \nignored it. \n298.  Finally, Governor Snyder was forced to admit that there was an emergency he \ncould no longer ignore. His Executive Director sent an e-mail on September 29, 2015 to Mr. \nMuchmore, Nick Lyon, and Defendant Wyant, among others, soliciting information for a \nmeeting regarding emergency management and noting that Dr. Wells “should be speaking with \nHurley.” \n299.  A September 29, 2015, internal e-mail between MDHHS employees refers to the \nsituation in Flint as sounding “like a third world country” and openly wondering when the \nfederal government might be able to step in. \n  55 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 56 of 89    Pg ID 56\n300.  The same day, MDHHS employees discuss efforts made by Genesee County to \nobtain MDHHS data. Ms. Lasher writes “I understand that we are still reviewing the data – but \nthe county has basically issued a ransom date that they want this information by tomorrow... \nEden – please coordinate an answer so Nick can walk into the 1 p.m. (meeting with the \ngovernor) prepared on this.” \n301.  As demonstrated in Ms. Lasher’s email, the state continued to refuse to take even \nthe simplest measure to protect public health until outsiders forced it to do so. \n302.  Also on September 29, 2015, Geralyn Lasher e-mailed Defendants Peeler and \nWells, Scott, and several others at MDHHS: “Is it possible to get the same type of data for just \nchildren under the age of six? So basically, the city of Flint kids ages six and under with the \nsame type of approach as the attached chart you gave us last week?”  \n303.  Linda Dykema responds to fellow MDHHS employees including Defendant \nWells: “[i]t’s bad enough to have a data war with outside entities, we absolutely cannot engage \nin competing data analyses within the Department, or, heaven forbid, in public releases.”  \n304.  Defendant Wells’s only reply to that email was a single word: “Agree,” showing \nMDHHS continuing efforts to mislead the public, protect itself, and discredit Dr. Hanna-Attisha. \n305.  The MDHHS and its employees were completely disinterested in the truth or \nfinding out whether it may have made an error. \n306.  When Dr. Hanna-Attisha directly e-mailed Defendant Wells with updated \nfindings that isolated certain high risk areas of the city and showed that blood lead levels have \n“more than tripled,” Defendant Wells responded that the state was working to replicate Hanna-\nAttisha’s analysis, and inquired about Dr. Hanna-Attisha’s plans to take the information public. \n  56 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 57 of 89    Pg ID 57\n307.  While discouraging her department to look further into Dr. Hanna-Attisha’s \nfindings and misleading Dr. Hanna-Attisha, Defendant Wells remained focused on a single task; \nsaving face at the expense of Flint’s residents. \n308.  Also on September 29, 2015, Genesee County issued its own health advisory \nabout Flint’s water. Two days later, the county warned Flint residents not to drink the water. \n309.  As the lead crisis unfolded, the State also obscured the cause of Flint’s \nLegionnaires’ disease outbreak. Because of the common cause, the lack of corrosion control, this \neffort further hindered outside efforts with respect to the lead problem. \n310.  The state actively prevented interested federal officials from becoming involved \nin the Legionnaires’ investigation. \n311.  A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) employee wrote to \nGenesee County Health officials in April of 2015: “We are very concerned about this \nLegionnaires’ disease outbreak...It’s very large, one of the largest we know of in the past decade, \nand community-wide, and in our opinion and experience it needs a comprehensive \ninvestigation.” \n312.  That e-mail added “I know you’ve run into issues getting information you’ve \nrequested from the city water authority and the MI Dept of Environmental Quality. Again, not \nknowing the full extent of your investigation it’s difficult to make recommendations, and it may \nbe difficult for us to provide the kind of detailed input needed for such an extensive outbreak \nfrom afar.” \n313.  On December 5, 2015, an employee of Genesee County Health Department \naccused state officials of covering up their mishandling of Flint’s Legionnaires’ disease \noutbreak. Tamara Brickey wrote to colleagues that “[t]he state is making clear they are not \n  57 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 58 of 89    Pg ID 58\npracticing ethical public health practice.” Further, “evidence is clearly pointing to a deliberate \ncover-up,” and “[i]n my opinion, if we don’t act soon, we are going to become guilty by \nassociation.”  \n314.  On October 1, 2015, the MDHHS officially confirmed Dr. Hanna-Attisha’s \nresults. Department employees developed a “talking points” memorandum that gently admitted \nthat further analysis of their own data supported the doctor’s findings, but cited lead paint as a \ngreater concern than the water. \n315.   Finally, after months of denial, obstruction, and lies, the State began to act on \nOctober 12, 2015. Governor Snyder received a proposal to reconnect Flint to DWSD and worked \non plans for lead testing and water filters. Still, Governor Snyder’s “comprehensive action plan” \nstated that “[t]he water leaving Flint’s drinking water system is safe to drink, but some families \nwith lead plumbing in their homes or service connections could experience higher levels of lead \nin the water that comes out of their faucets.” \n316.  Subsequent tests have shown that lead levels in Flint’s water have been so high \nthat filters could not remove all lead, meaning that the state’s recommendation and distribution \nof filters as a solution continued to inflict harm. \n317.  On October 16, 2015, Flint reconnected to DWSD. However, the damage had \nbeen done and lead has continued to leach from pipes into the water. \n318.  Two days later Defendant Wyant admitted the colossal failure that his department \nhad made, many months after it was expressly brought to their attention. Wyant informed \nGovernor Snyder that “staff made a mistake while working with the City of Flint. Simply stated, \nstaff employed a federal (corrosion control) treatment protocol they believed was appropriate, \nand it was not.” Also; “simply said, our staff believed they were constrained by two consecutive \n  58 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 59 of 89    Pg ID 59\nsix-month tests. We followed and defended that protocol. I believe now we made a mistake. For \ncommunities with a population above 50,000, optimized corrosion control should have been \nrequired from the beginning. Because of what I have learned, I will be announcing a change in \nleadership in our drinking water program.” \n319.  Defendant Wyant admitted to the Detroit News that MDEQ’s “actions reflected \ninexperience, and our public response to the criticism was the wrong tone early in this \nconversation.”  \n320.  Apparently, by “early in this conversation,” Wyant meant “until today.” On \nOctober 21, 2015, Governor Snyder appointed a five person task force to investigate the Flint \nwater crisis. The task force included Ken Sikkema, senior policy fellow at Public Sector \nConsultants, Chris Kolb, president of the Michigan Environmental Council, Matthew Davis, a \nprofessor of pediatrics and internal medicine at the University of Michigan, Eric Rothstein, a \nprivate water consultant, and Lawrence Reynolds, a Flint pediatrician. The day before the task \nforce’s findings were released, Snyder’s new chief of staff wrote to him that “[i]f this is the path \nthat the Task Force is on, it is best to make changes at DEQ sooner rather than later. That likely \nmeans accepting Dan’s resignation. It also means moving up the termination of the 3 DEQ \npersonnel previously planned for Jan 4 to tomorrow.” \n321.  On December 29, 2015, the task force issued a letter detailing its findings. \n322.  In that letter, the task force stated that “[w]e believe the primary responsibility for \nwhat happened in Flint rests with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ). \nAlthough many individuals and entities at state and local levels contributed to creating and \nprolonging the problem, MDEQ is the government agency that has responsibility to ensure safe \n  59 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 60 of 89    Pg ID 60\ndrinking water in Michigan. It failed in that responsibility and must be held accountable for that \nfailure.” \n323.  The task force letter continued: “The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) places \nresponsibility for compliance with its requirements on the public water system. In this instance, \nthe City of Flint had the responsibility to operate its water system within SDWA requirements, \nunder the jurisdiction of the MDEQ. The role of the MDEQ is to ensure compliance with the \nSDWA through its regulatory oversight as the primary agency having enforcement responsibility \nfor the Flint water system.” \n324.  The letter indicated that the MDEQ had failed to properly interpret and apply the \nLead and Copper Rule. The letter pointed to a “minimalist approach to regulatory and oversight \nauthority” at MDEQ’s Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance (headed by \nDefendant Shekter-Smith) which “is unacceptable and simply insufficient to the task of public \nprotection. It led to MDEQ’s failure to recognize a number of indications that switching the \nwater source in Flint would-and did- compromise both water safety and water quality.” \n325.  . The letter also noted that “[t]hroughout 2015, as the public raised concerns and \nas independent studies and testing were conducted and brought to the attention of MDEQ, the \nagency’s response was often one of aggressive dismissal, belittlement, and attempts to discredit \nthese efforts and the individuals involved.” \n326.  Further, that “the MDEQ seems to have been more determined to discredit the \nwork of others—who ultimately proved to be right—than to pursue its own oversight \nresponsibility.” \n  60 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 61 of 89    Pg ID 61\n327.  Regarding other failures of the state, the task force report noted that “we are \nparticularly concerned by recent revelations of MDHHS’s apparent early knowledge of, yet \nsilence about, elevated blood lead levels detected among Flint’s children.” \n328.  “The City of Flint’s water customers—fellow Michigan citizens—were needlessly \nand tragically exposed to toxic levels of lead through their drinking water supply.” The report \nalso notes that the state government should be responsible for remedying the tragedy, “having \nfailed to prevent it.” \n329.  In October 2015, Defendant Shekter-Smith was reassigned so as to have no \nresponsibility for Flint’s drinking water. \n330.  On December 5, 2015, the City of Flint declared a state of emergency. In response \nto a blog post by Professor Edwards entitled “Michigan Health Department Hid Evidence of \nHealth Harm Due to Lead Contaminated Water. Allowed False Public Assurances by MDEQ and \nStonewalled Outside Researchers,” the Governor’s Communications Director wrote to Governor \nSnyder and others “[i]t wasn’t until the Hurley report came out that our epidemiologists took a \nmore in-depth look at the data by zip code, controlling for seasonal variation, and confirmed an \nincrease outside of normal trends. As a result of this process we have determined that the way we \nanalyze data collected needs to be thoroughly reviewed.” \n331.  In other words, MDHHS’s failure to properly analyze its own data was a matter of \npractice, pattern, custom, and/or policy. \n332.  On December 23, 2015, the Michigan Auditor General provided an investigative \nreport on the crisis, finding that corrosion control should have been maintained from the \nbeginning and that improper sample sites had been selected by the MDEQ. \n333.  On December 30, 2015, Defendants Wyant and Wurfel resigned. \n  61 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 62 of 89    Pg ID 62\n334.  On January 4, 2016, Genesee County declared its own state of emergency. \n335.  On January 12, 2016, the Governor called the National Guard into Flint and \nrequested assistance from FEMA. \n336.  On January 13, 2015, the Governor announced the massive spike in Legionnaires’ \ndisease in Genesee county, ten months after the state was made aware that the spike coincided \nwith the switch to Flint River water. \n337.  On January 16, 2016, President Obama declared a federal state of emergency in \nhis January 19, 2016, State of the State address, Governor Snyder admitted to the people of Flint \nthat “Government failed you at the federal, state and local level.” \n338.  On January 21, 2016, EPA’s Susan Hedman resigned over her involvement in the \nFlint Water crisis. Hedman had acted with deliberate indifference to the MDEQ’s failures to \nfollow federal law and guidelines, and helped to silence Del Toral. \n339.  On January 21, 2016, the EPA issued an Emergency Order, based on its finding \nthat “the City of Flint’s and the State of Michigan’s responses to the drinking water crisis in Flint \nhave been inadequate to protect public health and that these failures continue.”  \n340.  The Emergency Order included as Respondents the City of Flint, the MDEQ, and \nthe Emergency Order provided for the EPA to conduct its own sampling of lead in Flint’s water \nand undertake other actions as part of a process “to abate the public health emergency in the City \nof Flint.” \n341.  The Emergency Order notes that “[t]he presence of lead in the City water supply \nis principally due to the lack of corrosion control treatment after the City’s switch to the Flint \nRiver as a source in April 2014. The river’s water was corrosive and removed protective coatings \n  62 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 63 of 89    Pg ID 63\nin the system. This allowed lead to leach into the drinking water, which can continue until the \nsystem’s treatment is optimized.” \n342.  The Emergency Order indicates that “water provided by the City to residents \nposes an imminent and substantial endangerment to the health of those persons. Those persons’ \nhealth is substantially endangered by their ingestion of lead in waters that persons legitimately \nassume are safe for human consumption.” \n343.  Further, the EPA states that “The City, MDEQ and the State have failed to take \nadequate measures to protect public health.” \n344.  According to the Emergency Order: “Based upon the information and evidence, \nEPA determines that Respondents’ actions that resulted in the introduction of contaminants, \nwhich entered a public water system and have been consumed and may continue to be consumed \nby those served by the public water system, present an imminent and substantial endangerment \nto the health of persons.” \n345.  In a public statement, EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy declared: “Let’s be \nreally clear about why we are here today...We are here today because a state-appointed \nemergency manager made the decision that the City of Flint would stop purchasing treated water \nthat had well served them for 50 years and instead purchase untreated — and not treat that water \n— and by law the state of Michigan approved that switch and did not require corrosion control. \nAll to save money. Now that state decision resulted in lead leaching out of lead service pipes and \nplumbing, exposing kids to excess amounts of lead. That’s why we’re here.” \n346.  On January 22, Defendants Shekter-Smith and Busch were suspended without \npay. Defendant Shekter-Smith’s firing was announced on February 5, 2016. \n  63 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 64 of 89    Pg ID 64\n347.  At one of several congressional hearings on the subject, EPA Deputy Assistant \nAdministrator Joel Beauvais testified \"MDEQ incorrectly advised the City of Flint that \ncorrosion-control treatment was not necessary, resulting in leaching of lead into the city's \ndrinking water... EPA regional staff urged MDEQ to address the lack of corrosion control, but \nwas met with resistance. The delays in implementing the actions needed to treat the drinking \nwater and in informing the public of ongoing health risks raise very serious concerns.\" \nCOUNT I: \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 – SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS – DEPRIVATION OF \nCONTRACTUALLY CREATED PROPERTY RIGHT \n(Against Defendants City of Flint, Croft, Glasgow, State of Michigan, Snyder,  \nEarley, Ambrose, MDEQ, Shekter-Smith, Wyant, Busch, Cook, Prysby, and Wurfel) \n \n348.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 347 of this \ncomplaint, as though fully restated herein. \n349.  Plaintiffs possessed and were deprived of a state contract law created property \nright to purchase and receive safe, potable drinking water. \n350.  Plaintiffs’ right was created by the actions of the parties as well as under Section \n§ 46-16 et. seq. of the Flint City Ordinance. \n351.  Plaintiffs’ right is so rooted in the traditions and conscience of the American \npeople as to be ranked as fundamental and protected by the Constitution. \n352.  Defendants violated Plaintiffs’ property right when, ceasing to provide Plaintiffs \nwith safe, potable water, they provided Plaintiffs with poisonous, contaminated water.  \n353.  The violation of Plaintiffs’ property right is not adequately redressed in a state \nbreach of contract action. \n354.  The violation of Plaintiffs’ property right involved Defendants’ failure to \nadequately train, supervise, and/or hire employees. \n  64 \n1867431 v1/15001.0003\n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 1   Filed 06/27/16   Pg 65 of 89    Pg ID 65\n355.  It was Defendants’ practice to inadequately train, supervise, and/or hire \nemployees. \n356.  Defendants’ outrageous, deliberate acts and/or inaction in violating Plaintiffs’ \nprotected property right caused Plaintiffs to suffer injuries. \n357.

Judith E. Levy \n  United States District Judge \nState of Michigan, et al.,   \n  Mag. Judge Mona K. Majzoub \nDefendants. \n \n________________________________/ \n \nOPINION AND ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANTS’  \nMOTIONS TO STAY [166, 169, 173] \n \n  On June 5, 2017, the Court entered an opinion and order granting \nin part and denying in part the defendants’ motions to dismiss.  (Dkt. \n151.)  In that opinion, the Court denied the motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ \nsubstantive due process bodily integrity claim against defendants City \nof Flint, Earley, Ambrose, Wyant, and Croft, and defendants Shekter \nSmith, Busch, Prysby, Wurfel, Wells, Scott, Lyon, and Peeler in their \nindividual capacities.  (Dkt. 151 at 100.)  Between June 19, 2017 and \nJuly 3, 2017, each of those defendants filed an interlocutory appeal of \nthe Court’s order, which were permitted because the Court’s opinion \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 215   Filed 10/30/17   Pg 2 of 6    Pg ID 6759\ndetermined that qualified immunity did not apply to them.  (Dkts. 157, \n158, 167, 174, and 180.)  The Court determines that oral argument is \nnot required pursuant to E.D. Mich. Local R. 7.1(f)(2).   \n  Each of those defendants has filed or joined in a motion to stay \nthis case pending the outcome of their appeals.  (Dkts. 166, 169, 173.)  \nThe  defendants  generally  make  two  arguments:  1)  the  filing  of  the \nnotices  of  appeal  divested  the  Court  of  jurisdiction  over  at  least  the \nclaims that are the subject of the appeal, if not the entire case; and 2) a \nstay  is  warranted  on  equitable  grounds.    Plaintiffs  argue  that  the \nnotices of appeal filed are insufficient to divest the Court of jurisdiction, \nthat the appeals only divest the Court of jurisdiction over the subject \nmatter of the appeals and not the entire case, and that the factors for \nan equitable stay of the case do not justify a stay of the entire case.   \n  “The  filing  of  a  notice  of  appeal  is  an  event  of  jurisdictional \nsignificance—it confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests \nthe district court of its control over those aspects of the case involved in \nthe appeal.”  Griggs v. Provident Consumer Disc. Co., 459 U.S. 56, 58 \n(1982).    However,  if  the  district  court  determines  that  the  appeal  is \n2 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 215   Filed 10/30/17   Pg 3 of 6    Pg ID 6760\nfrivolous, it retains jurisdiction over the entire case.  Yates v. City of \nCleveland, 941 F.2d 444, 449 (6th Cir. 1991).   \nPlaintiffs  argue  that  the  Court  should  err  in  favor  of  retaining \njurisdiction, because it is possible that the appeals might be based on \nfactual, rather than legal, disputes.  (See, e.g., Dkt. 187 at 5-6 (citing \ncases).)    The  Court  has  previously  considered  this  argument  and \ndeclined to certify the pending appeals as frivolous.  (Dkt. 208 at 2-3.)  \nFurther, at the motion to dismiss phase a qualified immunity appeal in \nthis  case  must  be  legal  in  nature  and  not  factual,  and  second,  the \nappeals  are  not  substantively  frivolous  in  nature.    Accordingly,  the \nCourt is divested of jurisdiction over every defendant who has appealed, \nbecause  each  of  those  defendants  have  appealed  every  claim  against \nthem.  The case must be stayed as to each of these defendants. \nThe  remaining  question  is  whether  the  Court  should  stay  the \nentirety  of  these  proceedings  pending  appeal,  including  the  pending \nprofessional negligence claims against Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, \nInc. and Veolia North America.   “[A] defendant’s interlocutory appeal \non  federal  qualified  immunity  does  not  divest  the  district  court  of \njurisdiction over pendent state-law claims,” subject to the exception of \n3 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 215   Filed 10/30/17   Pg 4 of 6    Pg ID 6761\nstate-law  immunity  being  asserted,  denied,  and  appealed  alongside \nfederal qualified immunity.  Krycinski v. Packowski, 556 F. Supp. 2d \n740, 741 (W.D. Mich. 2008) (citing Knox v. City of Royal Oak, Case No. \n06-cv-10428, 2007 WL 1775369, *2 (E.D. Mich. June 20, 2007)).  Neither \nLockwood nor Veolia have moved to stay the case.  And none of the \ndefendants who seek stays have provided any reason why permitting \nthe  claims  to  proceed  against  these  two  parties  would  prejudice  the \nmoving defendants in this litigation. \nAccordingly, it is hereby ordered that the motions to stay pending \nappeal (Dkts. 166, 169, 173) are GRANTED as to defendants City of \nFlint, Earley, Ambrose, Wyant, Croft, Shekter Smith, Busch, Prysby, \nWurfel, Wells, Lyon, and Peeler, and this case is STAYED as to those \ndefendants.  Although he did not move for a stay, the remaining claim \nagainst defendant Scott is also STAYED, as he is appealing a denial of \nqualified immunity. \nPlaintiffs  have  filed  a  motion  for  leave  to  file  an  amended \ncomplaint (Dkt. 161) that reasserts claims against the defendants who \nhave appealed and adds pendent state law claims against additional \nprivate engineering defendants.  The Court has jurisdiction to consider \n4 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 215   Filed 10/30/17   Pg 5 of 6    Pg ID 6762\nthe motion to amend the complaint, because it adds new parties that \nwould not be able to raise qualified immunity as a defense to the claims \nagainst them, and it does not alter the claims against the defendants \nwho have appealed. \nThe proposed amended complaint raises two issues that must be \naddressed.    First,  the  amended  complaint  seeks  to  be  a  class-action \nlawsuit.    The  Court  has  consolidated  all  other  pending  Flint  water \nclass-action litigation as a single suit in Waid v. Snyder, Case No. 16-cv-\n10444.  If this case is amended to become a class action, it would be \nconsolidated  with  Waid  once  it  is  unstayed.    Second,  the  amended \ncomplaint  adds  Rowe  Professional  Services  Company,  a  Michigan \ncompany.  If the complaint is amended and the Sixth Circuit determines \nthat the governmental defendants are entitled to qualified immunity, \nthe Court would lack original jurisdiction over this case if it proceeded \nas an individual, rather than class action, case. \nPlaintiffs are to file supplemental briefing with the Court on or \nbefore November 17, 2017 stating whether they wish to proceed with \nthe motion to amend the complaint as it currently stands.  If they do \nwish to proceed, plaintiffs are required to address the two issues the \n5 \n \n\n5:16-cv-12412-JEL-MKM   Doc # 215   Filed 10/30/17   Pg 6 of 6    Pg ID 6763\nCourt has identified with their amended complaint.  If they do not wish \nto proceed, plaintiffs must either propose a date by which they may file \na revised motion for leave to file an amended complaint, or state their \nintention to proceed with their complaint as currently drafted.  This \nbriefing is limited to twenty-five pages.   \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nDated: October 30, 2017    s/Judith E. Levy                     \nAnn Arbor, Michigan        JUDITH E.

Judith E. Levy \n \n \nUPDATED REPORT OF SPECIAL MASTER REGARDING REVISED \nDATA ON TIMELY AND VALID  OPT-OUTS FROM THE CLASS \nPORTION OF THE PARTIAL SETTLEMENT \n \nThe following report provides an update to the previous Report of Special \nMaster on Evaluation of Opt-Out Forms Submitted in Connection with the Partial \nSettlement, ECF No. 1998 (the “Report &  Recommendation”). This update is \nprovided pursuant to a change in circumstances of one individual who filed both a \nregistration form and an opt-out form and did not previously respond to inquiries to \nconfirm his position.  \nOn January 21, 2021, the Court issued its Opinion and Order Granting \nPlaintiffs’ Motion to Establish Settlement Claims Procedures and Allocation and for \nPreliminary Approval  of  Class  Settlement Components [1318]  and  Granting \nPlaintiffs’ Motion for an Order Adopting the Proposed Motion for Approval of \n1 \n \n \n\nCCaassee  55::1166--ccvv--1120441424--JJEELL--MEKAMS      EECCFF  NNoo..  2219211, ,P PaaggeeIDID.8.7427297  7 F  i lFeidle 0d3 0/029/2/242/2  2 P  a Pgaeg 7e4 2 o of f8 65\n \nWrongful Death Settlement [1334],  ECF No. 1399, PageID.54398-54469.1  In that \nOrder, the Court established March 29, 2021 as the deadline for those persons or \nentities who comprise the proposed settlement class to register for, object to, or opt \nout of the settlement.  Registration forms and opt-out forms were to be submitted to \nthe Claims Administrator to be logged and compiled.   \nOn October 25, 2021, I filed the Report of Special Master on Evaluation of \nOpt-Out Forms Submitted in Connection with the Partial Settlement, ECF No. 1998, \nPageID.68630-68646  (the  “Report  &  Recommendation”).  The  Report  & \nRecommendation  provided  a  categorization  of  the  opt-out  submissions  in \naccordance with the provisions of Article 19 and a recommendation with respect to \nthe treatment of those who erroneously submitted opt-out forms.  As described in \nthe Report & Recommendation: \nA  total of  195  opt-out forms were  submitted timely (i.e., \nreceived or postmarked on or before March 29, 2021). Of these \ntimely opt-out forms, 30 were submitted by Individual Plaintiffs \nwho are not counted as opt-outs under Article 19 of the ASA \nbecause they are not class members, and 14 of the forms do not \nmeet the requirements of a valid opt-out under the ASA because \nthe individual did not check the box confirming the desire to \nopt-out and/or did not sign the opt-out form. Of the remaining \n151 individuals who submitted opt-out forms, 39 advised Class \nCounsel that they intended to participate in the settlement and \ncompleted the opt-out form by mistake. Of those 39 individuals, \nthree  advised  that  they  were  attempting  to  register  for \n \n1 All capitalized terms herein have the same meaning set forth in the Amended \nSettlement Agreement that the Court. \n \n2 \n \n \n\nCCaassee  55::1166--ccvv--1120441424--JJEELL--MEKAMS      EECCFF  NNoo..  2219211, ,P PaaggeeIDID.8.7428207  8 F  i lFeidle 0d3 0/029/2/242/2  2 P  a Pgaeg 7e5 3 o of f8 65\n \nthemselves and their spouse but mistakenly used the opt-out \nform and not the registration form. Some of these individuals \nalso submitted a registration form and some completed the opt-\nout form believing it was in fact a registration form. After \naccounting  for  the  circumstances  above,  there  are  112 \nindividuals or entities that timely completed the opt-out form as \nrequired and have indicated that they intended to opt-out of the \nsettlement class. \n \nReport & Recommendation, PageID.68632-68633. \nOn November 10, 2021, the Court issued its Opinion and Order Granting \nFinal Approval of a Partial Settlement, Granting Certification of a Settlement Class, \nGranting Appointment of Settlement Class Counsel [1794], Denying Objections, and \nAdopting the Report and Recommendation [2006], ECF No. 2008, PageID.69537-\n69714 (“Final Approval Order”). \nOn November 12, 2021, the Court issued its Order Adopting Report and \nRecommendation [1998], ECF No. 2010, PageID.69722-69724.  The Order stated, \ninter alia, that, after accounting for those that do not meet the requirements of a valid \nopt-out for the reasons stated in the Report & Recommendation, “the Special Master \ndetermined that there are 112 individuals or entities that timely completed the opt-\nout form and have indicated that they intended to opt-out of the settlement class.”  \nId., PageID.69723. \nThe Special Master has now been notified that one of the 112 individuals \nidentified as opt-outs has advised that he did not intend to opt out and in fact \n3 \n \n \n\nCCaassee  55::1166--ccvv--1120441424--JJEELL--MEKAMS      EECCFF  NNoo..  2219211, ,P PaaggeeIDID.8.7428217  9 F  i lFeidle 0d3 0/029/2/242/2  2 P  a Pgaeg 7e6 4 o of f8 65\n \nsubmitted the opt-out form in error. Exhibit 1 to this Updated Report is  the \nDeclaration of Leslie Kroeger (“Kroeger Declaration”), dated February 22, 2022.  \nThe Kroeger Declaration states that one individual, Dale Clinton, was registered for \nthe partial settlement with the assistance of counsel on or about March 5, 2021.  \nKroeger Decl. ¶3. He also separately and on his own accord filed an opt-out form \ndated March 9, 2021. Id. Multiple attempts were made to contact Mr. Clinton to \nclarify his intent, but those efforts were unsuccessful. Id. Because he failed to clarify \nhis  intent, he  was  deemed to  be  an opt-out for  purposes of  the Report & \nRecommendation. Mr. Clinton has since confirmed his wish to participate in the \nSettlement Program and he has requested that his opt-out form be withdrawn. \nKroeger Decl. ¶4.  \nAlthough Mr. Clinton’s clarification was delayed, he is in the same position \nas other individuals who submitted both a registration and an opt-out form in error.  \nAccordingly, I recommend that Mr. Clinton be permitted to withdraw his opt-out \nand participate in the Settlement Program. If the Court accepts this recommendation, \nthen the number of opt-outs will be reduced by 1 to 111.  Exhibit 2 (attached hereto) \nis the list of the 111 individuals or entities who constitute the opt-outs if this \nrecommendation is approved.   \n \n \n4 \n \n \n\nCCaassee  55::1166--ccvv--1120441424--JJEELL--MEKAMS      EECCFF  NNoo..  2219211, ,P PaaggeeIDID.8.7428228  0 F  i lFeidle 0d3 0/029/2/242/2  2 P  a Pgaeg 7e7 5 o of f8 65\n \nRespectfully submitted,  \nDated February 24, 2022  /s/ Deborah E.
