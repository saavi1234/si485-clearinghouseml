    "summary": "<p>On February 10, 2019, a group of beneficiaries of Temporary Protected Status (“TPS”) from Honduras and Nepal and their U.S.-citizen children filed this class action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU Foundation of Southern California, the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, Asian Americans Advancing Justice, and private attorneys, sued the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as attorneys’ fees and costs. The plaintiffs challenged the Trump Administration’s recent decisions to terminate the TPS designations for Honduras and Nepal, alleging that the decisions violated the APA as well as equal protection and due process under the Fifth Amendment. </p><p>The plaintiffs pointed to another recent lawsuit challenging the Administration’s decisions to terminate TPS (in that case for El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Sudan), where this District Court issued a preliminary injunction halting the terminations. The plaintiffs claimed that the same defects in the terminations at issue in that case, <i>Ramos v. Nielsen</i> (located <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16815\">here</a> in this Clearinghouse), existed here. The case was originally assigned to Judge Jon Tigar, but was later reassigned to Judge Edward Chen after this case was related to <i>Ramos v. Nielsen</i>.</p><p>TPS is a form of humanitarian immigration relief that permits individuals from TPS-designated countries to lawfully live and work in the U.S. when they cannot safely return to their country of origin due to an exceptional circumstance, such as armed conflict or a natural disaster. The complaint stated that more than 100,000 individuals from Honduras and Nepal currently have TPS, most of them having lived in the U.S. for the majority of their lives. Many are also the parents of U.S.-citizen children, who would be faced with the choice of being separated from their families or leaving the only home they had ever known if their parents lost TPS. The minor plaintiffs sought to represent the following nationwide class: U.S.-citizen children, from ages five to eighteen, of all TPS holders from Honduras and Nepal. \t</p><p>The complaint explained that typically, when DHS was considering whether to terminate a country’s TPS designation, it would consider all of the conditions in that country, including the impact of crises or exceptional circumstances that occurred <i>after</i> the country’s original TPS designation. The plaintiffs then alleged that since President Trump took office, DHS, without any formal announcement, explanation, or acknowledgment of a departure from past practice, adopted a new interpretation of the TPS statute that no longer considers intervening country conditions. The plaintiffs claimed that this new interpretation and subsequent decisions to terminate TPS designations for certain countries were motivated by racial animus, highlighting President Trump’s various past statements denigrating non-white, non-European immigrants. </p><p>On March 12, 2019, the parties jointly stipulated to a stay of the proceedings in this case pending final resolution of the defendants’ appeal of the preliminary injunction in <i>Ramos</i>. Judge Chen granted the stipulation, finding that the “interests of justice and judicial economy would be served by treating the decisions terminating TPS for Honduras and Nepal similarly to the decisions at issue in <i>Ramos</i> during the pendency of the <i>Ramos</i> appeal.” The defendants agreed to abstain from implementing their decisions to terminate TPS for Nepal and Honduras pending the resolution of that appeal.</p><p>The Ninth Circuit heard oral argument on August 14, 2019. The Ninth Circuit vacated the injunction in <i>Ramos</i> on September 14, 2020. 975 F.3d 872., but the appellate court has yet to issue a directive to the district court to make the decision effective. On December 9, 2020, DHS published a <a href =\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/12/09/2020-27154/continuation-of-documentation-for-beneficiaries-of-temporary-protected-status-designations-for-el\"> notice</a> extending TPS for Honduras and Nepal through October 4, 2021 As of March 16, 2021, the injunction remains in effect, and the defendants still may not terminate TPS for Nepal and Honduras. The case is ongoing.</p><p></p>",

Plaintiffs, beneficiaries of Temporary Protected Status (“TPS”) from Nepal and \n3  Honduras and U.S.-citizen children of TPS holders from those two countries, challenge the Trump \n4  Administration’s recent decisions to terminate the TPS designations for Nepal and Honduras. TPS is \n5  a form of humanitarian immigration relief that allows individuals from designated countries to \n6  lawfully live and work in the United States when they cannot safely return to their country of origin \n7  due to armed conflict, natural disaster, or other “exceptional circumstances.” 8 U.S.C. 1254a (“the \n8  TPS statute”). On October 3, 2018, the United States District Court for the Northern District of \n9  California issued a preliminary injunction halting the Trump Administration’s earlier decisions to \n10  terminate TPS for individuals from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Sudan in Ramos v. Nielsen, \n11  Case No. 18-cv-01554-EMC. The defects identified in Ramos also infect the decisions challenged \n12  here.  \n13  2.  Currently, more than 100,000 individuals from Honduras and Nepal hold TPS. Many \n14  of them came to this country at a young age and have lived here productively for most of their lives. \n15  They have homes, spouses, jobs, businesses, and extensive social ties to their communities. TPS \n16  holders are also the parents of thousands of U.S.-citizen children, many of whom are school-aged.  \n17  3.  Congress created TPS in 1990 to establish formal criteria and procedures to replace \n18  various ad hoc practices the Executive Branch had previously used for decades in affording similar \n19  humanitarian relief to people from various countries. The power to designate, extend, or terminate \n20  TPS for individual countries now resides with the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security \n21  (“DHS”).  \n22  4.  When deciding whether to continue or instead terminate a country’s TPS designation, \n23  under every prior administration, DHS (and prior to its inception, the Attorney General) regularly \n24  considered all of the conditions in that country, including the impact of natural disasters and social \n25  or economic crises that occurred after the country’s original TPS designation.  \n26  5.  But after President Trump took office, DHS—without any formal announcement or \n27  other explanation and without acknowledging any departure from past practice—adopted a new \n28 \n1 \nCOMPLAINT – CASE NO. 19-CV-731 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00731   Document 1   Filed 02/10/19   Page 4 of 39\n1  interpretation of the TPS statute that eschews consideration of intervening country conditions. At \n2  times, DHS has maintained that the TPS statute requires this new interpretation. It does not. \n3  6.  As substantial evidence obtained from the Ramos litigation and elsewhere reveals, the \n4  decision to adopt that new interpretation, as well as the resulting decisions terminating TPS \n5  designations, were motivated by racial animus. President Trump has repeatedly broadcast his animus \n6  towards non-white, non-European immigrants. Most important, during a meeting in the White House \n7  discussing a legislative proposal that would have granted permanent residency to people from certain \n8  TPS-designated countries, he asked why the deal included people from “shithole countries” and \n9  expressed a preference for immigrants from countries “like Norway.” \n10  7.  The district court in Ramos examined extensive evidence of the White House’s \n11  racially discriminatory motivations and the pressure it exerted, at multiple levels, to influence the \n12  TPS decisions. The court also found that the Acting Secretary of DHS was influenced by that \n13  pressure. She “expressly acknowledged that the terminations of TPS designations were . . . designed \n14  to fit the President’s objectives on immigration which would put ‘America first.’”  \n15  8.  As a result of this “America first view,” the Trump Administration has approached \n16  TPS decisions with the stated goal of ending TPS “in general.” Since President Trump was sworn \n17  into office, DHS has announced decisions that, if permitted to take effect, would eliminate TPS \n18  protection for 98 percent of all TPS holders. \n19  9.  In the wake of the initial terminations of TPS designation for El Salvador, Haiti, \n20  Nicaragua, and Sudan, TPS-holder plaintiffs from those countries and their U.S.-citizen children \n21  successfully challenged the legality of those decisions in the United States District Court for the \n22  Northern District of California, winning a preliminary injunction against those TPS terminations \n23  under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) and the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth \n24  Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. See Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary \n25  Injunction, Ramos v. Nielsen, No. 3:18-cv-01554-EMC, ECF No. 128.  \n26  10.  The Ramos court concluded that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of \n27  their claim under the APA because “a wealth of record evidence” showed that, under President \n28  Trump, “DHS made a deliberate choice to base the TPS decision solely on whether the originating \n2 \nCOMPLAINT – CASE NO. 19-CV-731 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00731   Document 1   Filed 02/10/19   Page 5 of 39\n1  conditions or conditions directly related thereto persisted, regardless of other current conditions no \n2  matter how bad, and that this was a clear departure from prior administration practice.” Id. Thus, in \n3  terminating TPS for those countries, DHS adopted a new standard that departed from long-standing \n4  practice without any reasoned explanation, in violation of the APA. Id. \n5  11.  The Ramos court also found that the plaintiffs had raised serious questions on the \n6  merits of their Fifth Amendment claim, which alleged that DHS’s TPS termination decisions and \n7  departures from prior practice were motivated and influenced by racial animus against non-white, \n8  non-European immigrants. Id. \n9  12.  After Ramos was filed but before the court granted the preliminary injunction,1 \n10  Defendants announced the termination of TPS for Nepal and Honduras. Those decisions were made \n11  using the same flawed procedures described in Ramos and were infected by the same race-based \n12  motivation as the prior terminations.  \n13  13.  As a result of DHS’s unlawful actions, approximately 86,000 Honduran TPS holders \n14  and 15,000 Nepali TPS holders face the loss of their ability to live and work lawfully in this country. \n15  In addition, TPS holders from Nepal and Honduras have over 50,000 U.S.-citizen children. These \n16  children, many of whom are school-aged, face an impossible choice between leaving the only home \n17  they have ever known and growing up without one or both of their parents. \n18  14.  Plaintiffs challenge the termination of TPS for Honduras and Nepal on several \n19  grounds. \n20  15.  First, Defendants’ sudden and unexplained deviation from decades of consistent \n21  interpretation of the TPS statute and corresponding processes for extending or terminating TPS \n22  designations violates the APA. DHS terminated the TPS designations for Honduras and Nepal based \n23  solely on a consideration of whether the originating conditions prompting the designation have been \n24  abated. Defendants’ sub silentio departure from existing standards and practices fails to meet the \n25  minimum standards of considered judgment required by the APA.  \n26                                                   \n1 Ramos was originally filed on March 12, 2018. See Class Action Complaint, Ramos v. Nielsen, No. \n27  3:18-cv-01554 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 12, 2018), ECF No. 1. The court denied Defendants’ motion to \ndismiss five months later. See Order Denying Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, Ramos v. Nielsen, No. \n28  3:18-cv-01554 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 6, 2018), ECF No. 55. \n3 \nCOMPLAINT – CASE NO. 19-CV-731 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00731   Document 1   Filed 02/10/19   Page 6 of 39\n1  16.  Defendants and others in the Trump Administration have, at times, attempted to \n2  justify their new standard by asserting that the TPS statute prohibits consideration of intervening \n3  conditions. But that assertion is incorrect as a matter of law. When an agency acts based on a flawed \n4  legal rationale, the courts have authority to set aside the resulting agency decisions.   \n5  17.  Second, Defendants’ new standard for determining whether to extend TPS and the \n6  corresponding terminations issued under that standard violate the equal protection guarantee of the \n7  Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause because they were motivated by intentional race-, ethnicity-, \n8  and national-origin-based animus against TPS holders. In the lead-up to making TPS extension or \n9  termination decisions, the Trump Administration repeatedly expressed animus towards non-white, \n10  non-European immigrants, referred to TPS-designated nations as “shithole countries,” and reviewed \n11  TPS designations with the goal of removing non-white, non-European immigrants from the United \n12  States. DHS was directly influenced by the White House and its racist immigration policies, and it \n13  made decisions regarding TPS terminations on that unlawful basis. \n14  18.  Third, the new standard violates TPS beneficiaries’ Fifth Amendment’s Due Process \n15  right against arbitrary government invasion of personal liberty. The new standard constitutes an \n16  arbitrary, unexplained abandonment of the government’s long-standing interpretation of the TPS \n17  statute, on which several hundred-thousand TPS holders have come to rely. The Due Process Clause \n18  forbids the government from engaging in such arbitrary action when individual liberty and property \n19  interests are at stake. \n20  19.  Finally, Defendants’ imposition of an arbitrary new standard motivated by invidious \n21  discrimination violates the substantive due process rights of school-aged U.S.-citizen children of \n22  TPS holders, by presenting them with an intolerable choice: either leave this country or be forced to \n23  live without their parents. Families have a well-established, fundamental right to live together free \n24  from unwarranted government interference, and citizens of the United States have an absolute right \n25  to reside in this country. DHS’s abrupt changes in TPS-related process and standards do not advance \n26  a legitimate government interest sufficient to justify the significant burden on both of these rights \n27  created by the TPS terminations.  \n   \n28 \n4 \nCOMPLAINT – CASE NO. 19-CV-731 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00731   Document 1   Filed 02/10/19   Page 7 of 39\n1  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n2  20.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1331, because this action arises under the \n3  Constitution and the laws of the United States. This Court has additional remedial authority under \n4  the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. 2201 et seq., and the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 \n5  U.S.C. 701–706. \n6  21.  The federal government has waived its sovereign immunity and permitted judicial \n7  review of agency action under 5 U.S.C. 702. See Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) v. United States, 870 \n8  F.2d 518, 525 (9th Cir. 1989). Moreover, sovereign immunity would not bar claims against federal \n9  officials that seek solely to prevent future violations of federal law (rather than monetary relief). See, \n10  e.g., Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Commerce Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 697–99 & nn.18–19 (1949); \n11  Shields v. Utah Idaho Cent. R.R. Co., 305 U.S. 177, 183–84 (1938). \n12  22.  Venue is proper in the Northern District of California under 28 U.S.C. 1391(e)(1), \n13  because at least one Plaintiff resides in this judicial district and each Defendant is an agency of the \n14  United States or an officer of the United States sued in his or her official capacity. \n15  INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT \n16  23.  This civil action should be assigned to the San Francisco Division, because a related \n17  case, Ramos et al. v. Nielson et al., No. 3:18-cv-1554, is located in the San Francisco Division. In \n18  addition, assignment in the San Francisco Division is appropriate for purposes of Civil Local Rules \n19  3-2(d) and 3-5(b) because one of the claims of the named Plaintiffs arises in Alameda County. \n20  THE PARTIES \n21  Plaintiffs \n22  24.

Defendant Nielsen assumed office on or around December 6, 2017. As the \n17  highest-ranking officer for DHS, Defendant Nielsen is responsible for, among other things, \n18  “[e]stablishing national immigration enforcement policies and priorities.” 6 U.S.C. 202(5). On or \n19  about May 22, 2018, Defendant Nielsen terminated the designation of TPS for Nepal, and on or \n20  about June 5, 2018, Defendant Nielsen terminated the designation of TPS for Honduras. \n21  33.  Defendant Elaine C. Duke, sued in her official capacity, is currently the Deputy \n22  Secretary of Homeland Security and served as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security from around \n23  July 31, 2017 to December 6, 2017 or thereabout. As the chief operating officer for DHS, Defendant \n24  Duke is responsible for the administration and enforcement of the immigration laws of the United \n25  States. \n26  34.  Defendant U.S. Department of Homeland Security is a cabinet-level department of \n27  the Executive Branch of the federal government and is an “agency” within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. \n28  551(1). DHS includes various component agencies, such as the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration \n6 \nCOMPLAINT – CASE NO. 19-CV-731 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00731   Document 1   Filed 02/10/19   Page 9 of 39\n1  Services (“USCIS”), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”), and U.S. Immigration and \n2  Customs Enforcement (“ICE”). DHS, together with all of its component agencies, is responsible for \n3  administering and enforcing the nation’s immigration laws and policies, including the TPS statute. \n4  35.  Defendant United States of America includes all government agencies and \n5  departments responsible for the implementation, administration, and change in policy concerning the \n6  TPS statute. \n7  STATUTORY FRAMEWORK \n8  36.  Congress established the TPS program through the Immigration Act of 1990.2 TPS is \n9  a form of humanitarian relief, providing lawful immigration status to eligible foreign nationals who \n10  cannot safely return home to war-torn or disaster-stricken countries. By enacting the TPS statute, \n11  codified at 8 U.S.C. 1254a, Congress established formal criteria for relief and set forth predictable \n12  procedures for issuing, extending, or terminating that relief.3 \n13  37.  Under the TPS statute, the Secretary of Homeland Security4 may make a \n14  “designation” determination for a given country. After consulting with “appropriate” government \n15  agencies, the Secretary may designate a foreign state, or any part of that state, for TPS based on: \n16  (A) an “ongoing armed conflict within the state” that would “pose a serious threat” to the “personal \n17  safety” of returning nationals of that state; (B) an “earthquake, flood, drought, epidemic, or other \n18  environmental disaster in the state resulting in a substantial, but temporary, disruption of living \n19  conditions” if the foreign state is “unable, temporarily, to handle adequately the return to the state” \n20  of its nationals and the foreign state has “officially” requested a designation; or (C) “extraordinary \n                                                 \n21 \n2 Pub. L. No. 101-649, § 302, 104 Stat. 4978, 5030–36. \n3 The Executive Branch previously used ad hoc enforcement-based mechanisms to allow individuals \n22 \nto remain in the United States for humanitarian reasons. See Adam B. Cox & Cristina Rodríguez, \n23  The President and Immigration Law, 119 Yale L.J. 458, 501–02 (2009) (discussing use of the \n“parole power,” codified at 8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)). For example, Presidents occasionally exercised \n24  their discretion to designate countries for “Extended Voluntary Departure” and “Deferred Enforced \nDeparture.” Similar to TPS, both of those delayed-departure practices allowed foreign nationals to \n25 \nlawfully remain and work in the United States while conditions in their homeland were unsafe or \nreturn was otherwise impracticable. \n26 \n4 References to the Attorney General in provisions describing functions that have been transferred \n27  from the Department of Justice to the Department of Homeland Security “shall be deemed to refer to \nthe Secretary” of Homeland Security. See 6 U.S.C. 557. \n28 \n7 \nCOMPLAINT – CASE NO. 19-CV-731 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00731   Document 1   Filed 02/10/19   Page 10 of 39\n1  and temporary conditions in the foreign state” that prevent its nationals from safely returning, and \n2  where the temporary presence of those foreign nationals in the United States is not “contrary to the \n3  national interest of the United States.”5 \n4  38.  An initial TPS designation period for a given country lasts between six and eighteen \n5  months.6 Before the designation can become effective, the Secretary must publish a notice in the \n6  Federal Register that includes, among other things, a statement of findings, the effective date of the \n7  designation, and an estimate of the number of foreign nationals eligible for protected status. \n8  39.  Once the Secretary has designated a particular country for TPS, individuals from that \n9  country (or persons without nationality who last habitually resided in that country) may apply for \n10  TPS. To be eligible for TPS, applicants from a designated country must meet stringent requirements. \n11  These requirements include continued physical presence and continued residence in the United \n12  States from the most recent date of the foreign state’s designation through the date of the TPS \n13  application; satisfaction of certain criteria for admissibility as an immigrant; lack of disqualifying \n14  criminal history; and submission of an application, extensive documentation, and fees.7 \n15  40.  Congress intended that individuals who were ultimately granted protected status \n16  would enjoy the freedom to live and work in the United States without fear of removal or other \n17  reprisal. Under the statute, an individual who receives and maintains TPS shall be authorized to \n18  engage in employment in the United States; shall not be detained by the Secretary of Homeland \n19  Security on the basis of immigration status; and shall not be removed from the United States by the \n20  Department of Homeland Security.8 \n21  41.  Under the TPS statute, the Secretary must periodically re-evaluate country \n22  designations. At least 60 days before a TPS designation is set to expire, the Secretary must “review \n23  the conditions in the foreign state” and determine whether the country still meets the conditions for \n24  TPS.9 This periodic-review requirement also entails consultation with appropriate government \n                                                 \n25 \n5 8 U.S.C. 1254a(b)(1). \n6 8 U.S.C. 1254a(b)(2), (b)(3)(C). \n26 \n7 8 U.S.C. 1254a(c)(1); 8 C.F.R. 244.2, 244.4, 244.9. \n27  8 8 U.S.C. 1254a(a)(1), (d)(4). \n9 8 U.S.C. 1254a(b)(3). \n28 \n8 \nCOMPLAINT – CASE NO. 19-CV-731 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00731   Document 1   Filed 02/10/19   Page 11 of 39\n1  agencies. Unless the Secretary determines that the conditions warranting designation of TPS for a \n2  particular country no longer exist, the designation will be extended—by default—for a period of six \n3  months or, at the Secretary’s discretion, for a period of twelve or eighteen months.10 The resulting \n4  decision must be published by notice in the Federal Register. \n5  42.  When TPS is terminated for a particular country, the individual TPS holder’s status \n6  typically will revert back to his or her prior immigration status.11 \n7  THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ADOPTED A NEW STANDARD FOR TPS DECISIONS \n8  IN ORDER TO BRING ABOUT THE END OF TPS  \n9  43.  After President Trump took office, the White House began to pressure DHS to end \n10  TPS.   \n11  44.  The White House Domestic Policy Council sought repeatedly to influence the \n12  decision-making process at the State Department and DHS to ensure a predetermined outcome: the \n13  termination of TPS designations. Stephen Miller, President Trump’s senior advisory for domestic \n14  policy, “frequently” reached out to DHS to urge termination.  \n15  45.  Officials from President Trump’s immigration transition team, including Kathy \n16  Nuebel Kovarik and Lee Francis Cissna, assumed high-level positions at DHS and USCIS, where \n17  they directly shaped TPS policy. In October 2017, Kovarik hired Robert Law and assigned him \n18  responsibility for editing career staffs’ TPS recommendations. Law had previously worked for the \n19  “anti-immigrant hate group” Federation for American Immigration Reform (“FAIR”), where he co-\n20  authored a report for the 2017 Trump Presidential Transition calling to “revoke TPS for any country \n21  that has received more than two renewals.” \n22  46.  In order “to get to the President/White House’s desired result of terminating TPS,” \n23  President Trump’s political surrogates within DHS made numerous changes to TPS practices.12 Most \n24  significantly, under their leadership, DHS abandoned a long-established standard under which it \n25  considered all current conditions—including intervening events—in deciding whether to extend or \n26                                                   \n10 8 U.S.C. 1254a(b)(3)(C). \n27  11 8 C.F.R. 244.19. \n12 Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction, Ramos v. Nielsen, No. 3:18-cv-\n28  01554-EMC, ECF No. 128, at 32. \n9 \nCOMPLAINT – CASE NO. 19-CV-731 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00731   Document 1   Filed 02/10/19   Page 12 of 39\n1  terminate a country’s TPS designation. In its place, DHS adopted a new, narrow standard in which \n2  DHS considers only whether the original conditions that initially gave rise to the TPS designation \n3  persist.  \n4  47.  Before the Trump Administration, for at least twenty years, Republican and \n5  Democratic Administrations alike regularly relied on “[i]ntervening factors arising after a country’s \n6  original TPS designation to extend TPS.” Secretaries considered “the full range of current country \n7  conditions” in making TPS decisions, regardless of whether those conditions traced back to the event \n8  that triggered the original designation.  \n9  48.  Under the Trump Administration, in contrast, extensions would be permitted only \n10  when warranted by the continued effects of the original event triggering the TPS designation.  \n11  49.  In June 2017, then-Secretary Kelly described the new standard. He testified at a \n12  Senate hearing that DHS could only consider the original reason for a country’s designation when \n13  recommending extension or termination. He explained that, in the administration’s view, TPS “is for \n14  a specific event. In Haiti, it was the earthquake. Yes, Haiti had horrible conditions before the \n15  earthquake, and those conditions aren’t much better after the earthquake. But the earthquake was \n16  why TPS was—was granted and—and that’s how I have to look at it.”13 \n17  50.  Secretary Nielsen later echoed Kelly’s view. She testified, “[t]he law does not allow \n18  me to look at the country conditions of a country writ large. It requires me to look very specifically \n19  as to whether the country conditions originating from the original designation continue to exist. . . . \n20  [T]he law requires me, if I cannot say that the conditions emanating from the [earthquake in \n21  Honduras that originated the need for a TPS designation] still exist, regardless of other systemic \n22  conditions, I must terminate TPS.”14 She also testified, “[t]he law says that if the effects of the \n23 \n                                                 \n24  13 Hearing on the Department of Homeland Security F.Y. 2018 Budget Before the S.

If the underlying conditions in a country are \n3  themselves dangerous, unfortunately that is not something that I can consider in the termination.”15  \n4  51.  Internal agency guidance prepared by the Trump-era DHS directed, “[t]he law \n5  requires that when the conditions prompting a country’s original designation for TPS no longer exist, \n6  the Department must terminate the country’s TPS designation.”  \n7  52.  The White House directly urged the new standard as part of its overall effort to end \n8  TPS and as applied to specific countries. For example, in November 2017, three days before the \n9  statutory deadline for TPS decisions for Nicaragua and Honduras, the White House convened a \n10  Cabinet-level meeting urging termination for Nicaragua, Honduras, Haiti, and El Salvador. In a \n11  “Discussion Paper” to guide the meeting, the White House applied the new standard, asserting that \n12  termination was required because “the temporary conditions that arose out of natural disasters and \n13  supported [the original] TPS designations have long ceased to exist.”  \n14  53.  As one source described, following the meeting, White House Chief of Staff John \n15  Kelly and Homeland Security Advisor Tom Bossert called Acting Secretary Elaine Duke and “put \n16  massive pressure on her” to terminate TPS for Honduras and Nicaragua.16 They told her that TPS \n17  was an obstacle to the President’s “wider strategic goal” on immigration.17  \n18  54.  Subsequently, Acting Secretary Duke determined that “[t]he TPS program must end \n19  for these countries soon.” She acknowledged that “[t]his conclusion [was] the result of an America \n20  first view.” She then terminated TPS for Nicaragua. She declined to make a decision on TPS for \n21  Honduras, with the result that its TPS designation was automatically extended for six months. 8 \n22  U.S.C. 1254a(b)(3)(C). She made clear, however, that termination for Honduras was imminent under \n                                                 \n23 \n15 Hearing on the Department of Homeland Security F.Y. 2019 Budget Before the H.

POST (Nov. 9, 2017), \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/white-house-chief-of-staff-tried-to-\n27  pressure-acting-dhs-secretary-to-expel-thousands-of-hondurans-officials-say/2017/11/09/914d3700-\nc54a-11e7-a441-3a768c8586f1_story.html?utm_term=.a3d52a717ec9. \n28  17 Id. \n11 \nCOMPLAINT – CASE NO. 19-CV-731 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00731   Document 1   Filed 02/10/19   Page 14 of 39\n1  the new standard. In an email to White House Chief of Staff Kelly, she explained that her “no \n2  decision” on Honduras was “a strong break with past practice. . . . By not affirmatively extending, \n3  I’m stating that I’m not satisfied that the country conditions remain—but not yet sure how best to \n4  end TPS for this country.” She described her decisions as “send[ing] a clear signal that TPS in \n5  general is coming to a close . . . consistent with the President’s position on immigration.” \n6  55.  In addition to adopting a new standard for TPS decisions, the Trump Administration \n7  altered the process for conducting TPS reviews in other ways.  \n8  56.  Prior to the Trump Administration, TPS review began with an objective country \n9  conditions report prepared by career specialists. The reports formed the basis for decision memos \n10  containing the USCIS Director’s recommendation to the DHS Secretary and Federal Register notices \n11  announcing the decision. Career officials would draft Federal Register notices in tandem with the \n12  decision memos, because the final decisions published in those notices were guided by the \n13  recommendations from the career staff in the decision memos.  \n14  57.  In the Trump era, this process changed. Political surrogates assumed responsibility \n15  for the periodic TPS reviews. They disregarded the recommendations of career professionals and \n16  rewrote decision memos so that the memos would “fully support” the pre-determined decision to \n17  terminate TPS. Political surrogates also assumed control of drafting the Federal Register notices. \n18  Whereas under prior administrations the Federal Register notice followed logically from career \n19  officials’ drafts of the decision memos, under the Trump Administration this was no longer the case.   \n20  58.  In addition, whereas prior administrations had typically conducted separate review \n21  processes for each country, the Trump Administration reviewed multiple countries together, even \n22  though each had different originating and current conditions. For example, the White House \n23  “coordinat[ed] the conditions and process for terminating [TPS] for aliens from El Salvador, \n24  Honduras, Nicaragua, and Haiti.”  \n25  59.  Moreover, input from U.S. embassies, traditionally accorded great weight, was \n26  disregarded by the Trump-era DHS, because the input did not support the goal of termination. As \n27  James D. Nealon, chief of the DHS Office of Policy and former U.S. Ambassador to Honduras, \n28  testified, the State Department traditionally afforded great weight to ambassadors’ input. Under prior \n12 \nCOMPLAINT – CASE NO. 19-CV-731 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00731   Document 1   Filed 02/10/19   Page 15 of 39\n1  administrations there would have been significant debate if DHS were to reject an ambassador’s \n2  recommendation in favor of a contrary, internal recommendation. However, this all changed under \n3  the current administration. State Department leadership ignored cables from U.S. embassies in TPS-\n4  designated countries that sought to convey country conditions and offer recommendations on TPS \n5  decisions. Additionally, in some cases, State Department leadership stalled providing \n6  recommendations drafted by career State Department professionals until it was too late for DHS to \n7  substantively consider them. \n8  60.  The first TPS termination announced by the Trump Administration was for Sudan in \n9  September 2017. In a draft decision memo, career officials reviewed a broad range of country \n10  conditions, including intervening conditions, and concluded, “termination does not appear to be \n11  warranted.” Political surrogates then edited the memo to recommend termination. In support, they \n12  tacked on a section focused narrowly on the factors that triggered Sudan’s original designation. The \n13  resulting decision memo was so incoherent that the current USCIS Director Francis Cissna said it \n14  read “like one person who strongly supports extending TPS for Sudan wrote everything up to the \n15  recommendation section and then someone who opposes extension snuck up behind the first guy, \n16  clubbed him over the head, pushed his senseless body out of the way, and finished the memo.” The \n17  memo was changed several more times before ultimately being revised “to clearly support the . . . \n18  decision to terminate.”  \n19  61.  Subsequent terminations “underwent a similar process.” For example, Kovarik \n20  complained in October 2017 of a “problem” in decision memos drafted by career professionals for \n21  Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador, because they “read[] as though we’d recommend an \n22  extension b/c we talk so much about how bad it is, but there’s not enough in there about positive \n23  steps that have been taken since it’s designation.” A career professional responded, “We can comb \n24  through the country conditions to try to see what else there might be, but the basic problem is that it \n25  IS bad there [with respect to] all of the standard metrics. Our strongest argument for termination, we \n26  thought, is just that it is not bad in a way clearly linked to the initial disasters prompting the \n27  designations.” \n28 \n13 \nCOMPLAINT – CASE NO. 19-CV-731 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00731   Document 1   Filed 02/10/19   Page 16 of 39\n1  62.  DHS applied these same flawed processes to the two TPS terminations at issue in this \n2  case—for Nepal and for Honduras.  \n3  Nepal \n4  63.  On April 26, 2018, Secretary Nielsen announced her decision to terminate TPS for \n5  Nepal, with a twelve-month delayed effective date. 18 Like previous Trump-era TPS terminations, \n6  the decision was the product of the White House’s persistent and ongoing effort to end TPS.  \n7  64.  Nepal was first designated for TPS by Secretary Jeh Johnson on June 24, 2015, after a \n8  7.8 magnitude earthquake and a number of significant aftershocks struck the country, killing nearly \n9  9,000 people, injuring more than 20,000 people, displacing millions, and destroying or significantly \n10  damaging over 750,000 homes.19 On October 26, 2016, DHS extended Nepal’s designation for \n11  eighteen months.20 The extension took into account a variety of factors and conditions that arose \n12  subsequent to the original designation, many of which were wholly or partially unrelated to the \n13  earthquakes, including civil unrest, the obstruction of crossings at the Nepal-India border, and \n14  inadequate sanitation.21 \n15  65.  In terminating Nepal’s TPS, DHS applied its new standard. The Secretary considered \n16  only whether Nepal had recovered from the earthquake that triggered its original designation; \n17  intervening conditions that affected the country were not considered except to the extent they related \n18  directly to the original basis for designation. \n19  66.  During the periodic review process for Nepal, Trump surrogate Kathy Nuebel \n20  Kovarik instructed career employees to focus the country conditions report “specifically . . . on \n21  progress in earthquake and recovery efforts” as opposed to the “extremely comprehensive” overview \n22 \n23 \n                                                 \n24  18 Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Security, Secretary Kirstjen M. Nielsen Announcement on \nTemporary Protected Status for Nepal (Apr. 26, 2018) (emphases added), https://www.dhs. \n25 \ngov/news/2018/04/26/secretary-kirstjen-m-nielsen-announcement-temporary-protected-status-nepal. \n19 Designation of Nepal for Temporary Protected Status, 80 Fed. Reg. 36,346, 36,347 (June 24, \n26 \n2015). \n27  20 Extension of the Designation of Nepal for Temporary Protected Status, 81 Fed. Reg. 74,470 (Oct. \n26, 2016). \n28  21 Id. at 74,471. \n14 \nCOMPLAINT – CASE NO. 19-CV-731 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00731   Document 1   Filed 02/10/19   Page 17 of 39\n1  “usually” provided. In response, career employees agreed “not to devote research” to political crises \n2  and other intervening conditions not directly related to the earthquake.  \n3  67.  An early draft decision memo for Nepal described the decision whether to extend or \n4  terminate as a “close case.” It described the destructive intervening events that had befallen Nepal \n5  but then dismissed them, because they were not “primarily” related to the original event, stating: “In \n6  August 2017, the worst rains in 15 years struck Nepal, triggering widespread large-scale flooding \n7  and landslides, causing significant property damage, and impacting access to food, water, and \n8  healthcare, albeit primarily in the southern plains region that has been little affected by the \n9  earthquake.” The draft recommended termination with an eighteen-month wind down period.  \n10  68.  Upon reviewing a subsequent draft decision memo, Director Cissna complained that \n11  it did not “adequately support the proposal to terminate TPS.” He noted specific sections of the \n12  memo that he viewed as problematic, including factual statements about challenges to Nepal’s \n13  rebuilding efforts and the number of individuals still living in temporary shelters.  \n14  69.  The final Nepal decision memo recommended termination with a twelve-month wind \n15  down period and no longer described the decision as a “close case.” The memo emphasized original \n16  conditions and significantly downplayed the significance of any intervening factors. For example, it \n17  limited consideration of the damage caused by severe, post-earthquake flooding in Nepal to simply \n18  one of several “[f]actors delaying the completion of recovery and reconstruction efforts” but \n19  otherwise “unrelated to the earthquake that led to the TPS designation” and, therefore, not relevant \n20  to the termination decision. To the extent the decision memo considered the independent effects of \n21  severe flooding, it was only to assert that disruption caused by the flooding did not “rise to the level \n22  of a new event that would warrant a new TPS designation.”  \n23  70.  In a Press Release announcing the termination of TPS for Nepal, DHS explained, \n24  “[t]he decision to terminate TPS for Nepal was made after a review of the environmental disaster-\n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n15 \nCOMPLAINT – CASE NO. 19-CV-731 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00731   Document 1   Filed 02/10/19   Page 18 of 39\n1  related conditions upon which the country’s original designation was based and an assessment of \n2  whether those originating conditions continue to exist as required by statute.”22  \n3  71.  Accompanying DHS Press Affairs Guidance stated, “[b]ased on careful consideration \n4  of available information . . . the Secretary determined that the original conditions caused by the 2015 \n5  earthquake no longer exist. Thus, as required under the applicable statute, the current TPS \n6  designation must be terminated.” \n7  72.  The announcement terminating Nepal’s TPS was published in the Federal Register on \n8  May 22, 2018.23 The Federal Register Notice made no mention of intervening events and did not \n9  discuss the severe flooding of August 2017. \n10  Honduras \n11  73.  On May 4, 2018, Secretary Nielsen announced her decision to terminate TPS for \n12  Honduras with an eighteen-month delayed effective date. Again, like the previous Trump-era TPS \n13  terminations, her decision was the product of the Trump Administration’s systematic effort to end \n14  TPS. It effectuated a predetermined conclusion articulated by Acting Secretary Duke months earlier, \n15  when she allowed a short, automatic six-month extension for Honduras because she was “not yet \n16  sure how best to end TPS for this country.”  \n17  74.  Honduras was originally designated for TPS on January 5, 1999 by Attorney General \n18  Janet Reno, after Hurricane Mitch caused severe damage to the country.24 Multiple Attorneys \n19  General and DHS Secretaries extended TPS for Honduras in regular periodic reviews over nearly \n20  twenty years—fourteen times in all.25 Those extensions took into consideration social, economic, \n                                                 \n21 \n22 Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Security, Secretary Kirstjen M.

In terminating Honduras’s TPS, DHS applied its new standard. The Secretary \n6  assessed only whether Honduras had recovered from Hurricane Mitch and did not consider \n7  intervening conditions.  \n8  76.  For example, the Honduras decision memo explicitly dismissed “current challenges” \n9  because they “cannot be directly tied to damage from the storm 20 years ago.”  \n10 \n11 \n                                                 \n12  Ridge, DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff, DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano, and DHS Secretary Jeh \nJohnson.

The DHS press release announcing the Secretary’s decision explained, “[T]he \n2  Secretary determined that the disruption of living conditions in Honduras from Hurricane Mitch that \n3  served as the basis for its TPS designation has decreased to a degree that it should no longer be \n4  regarded as substantial. . . . Thus, as required under the applicable statute, the current TPS \n5  designation must be eliminated.”29 \n6  78.  On the same day that DHS publicly announced the termination of TPS for Honduras \n7  (and about six weeks after the filing of Ramos, challenging the new practice as unlawful), an \n8  addendum was added to the Honduras decision memo. The addendum provides supplemental \n9  information on environmental conditions related to problems caused by pine beetles and coffee rust. \n10  The Federal Register Notice announcing the termination of TPS for Honduras, published on June 5, \n11  2018, similarly mentions pine beetles and coffee rust, along with a range of other factors.  \n12  79.  The addendum and similar information in the Federal Register notice were added as \n13  post hoc justifications for DHS’s decision to terminate TPS for Honduras. They do not reflect the \n14  narrower range of factors—based solely on the impact of Hurricane Mitch—actually considered by \n15  DHS in deciding to terminate.    \n16  80.  In a May 11, 2018 memorandum, members of the Senate Foreign Relations \n17  Committee complained that Defendants “deliberately disregarded the counsel and expertise of \n18  officials at the State Department and the U.S. Embassies in [Honduras, El Salvador, and Haiti], \n19  which uniformly argued for an extension of the TPS designations.”30 As the memorandum observed, \n20  the termination “was the result of an overtly political process.”31 \n   \n21 \n22 \n23 \n                                                 \n24  29 Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Security, Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen M. \nNielsen Announcement on Temporary Protected Status for Honduras (May 4, 2018) (emphasis \n25  added), https://www.dhs.gov/news/2018/05/04/secretary-homeland-security-kirstjen-m-nielsen-\nannouncement-temporary-protected. \n26  30 Memorandum from the Senate Foreign Relations Comm.

The Secretary’s adoption of a new standard for TPS decisions and the termination of \n4  TPS for Honduras and Nepal, like the previous Trump-era TPS terminations, were motivated in \n5  significant part by racial and national-origin animus. As the court found in Ramos, there is evidence \n6  that the terminations were designed to further a predetermined presidential agenda to end TPS \n7  influenced by the President’s racial animus against non-white, non-European immigrants. This \n8  animus is evidenced by numerous statements made by President Trump and other officials in his \n9  administration expressing disdain for non-white, non-European immigrants. \n10  82.  Throughout his candidacy and presidency, President Trump has repeatedly denigrated \n11  non-white, non-European immigrants and has expressed his interest in resurrecting a vision of \n12  American identity that privileges whiteness.  \n13  83.  On the very first day of his presidential campaign, then-candidate Trump \n14  categorically branded Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists: “When Mexico sends its people, \n15  they’re not sending their best. . . . They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re \n16  bringing those problems with [them]. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re \n17  rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”32 \n18  84.  Both during his campaign and after taking office, President Trump has repeatedly \n19  compared immigrants to snakes that will bite and kill anyone foolish enough to shelter them.33 \n20  85.  President Trump has repeatedly “retweeted” avowed white nationalists, such as \n21  @WhiteGenocideTM, thereby endorsing their racist views and amplifying their message.34 \n22 \n23 \n                                                 \n24  32 Wash.

When a lawsuit against Trump University was assigned to Judge Gonzalo Curiel, \n2  then-candidate Trump repeatedly asserted that the Judge would be biased against him due to the \n3  Judge’s Mexican heritage.35  \n4  87.  After a crowd of white nationalists marched on Charlottesville, Virginia, President \n5  Trump praised some of the protesters as “very fine people.”36 \n6  88.  President Trump often conflates large groups of immigrants, and sometimes even all \n7  of them, with members of the MS-13 gang.37 In his first State of the Union address, he suggested \n8  that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) program, recipients of which are \n9  immigrants first brought to the United States as children many years ago, contributed to the spread \n10  of MS-13.38  \n11  89.  President Trump has also directed his racist remarks specifically at people who have \n12  lawful status through TPS. \n13  90.  On or about January 11, 2018, several lawmakers gathered with the President in the \n14  Oval Office of the White House to discuss a bipartisan immigration proposal. President Trump grew \n15  frustrated when the conversation turned to a proposal that would grant permanent status to some \n16  people with TPS protections from certain Latin American and African countries. “Why,” the \n17  President asked, “are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?”39 He expressed \n18  a preference, instead, for immigrants from countries “like Norway.”40 \n19 \n20 \n                                                 \n21  35 Matt Ford, Trump Attacks a ‘Mexican’ U.S. Federal Judge, THE ATLANTIC (May 28, 2016), \nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/trump-judge-gonzalo-curiel/484790/. \n22  36 Politico Staff, Full text: Trump’s comments on white supremacists, ‘alt-left’ in Charlottesville, \nPOLITICO (Aug. 15, 2017), https://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/15/full-text-trump-comments-\n23  white-supremacists-alt-left-transcript-241662. \n37 Terry Gross, Trump Uses MS-13 To ‘Sell Draconian Overhauls of Border Issues,’ Journalist Says, \n24  NPR (Feb. 15, 2018), https://www.npr.org/2018/02/15/585937834/trump-uses-ms-13-to-sell-\ndraconian-overhauls-of-border-issues-journalist-says. \n25  38 Liz Robbins, Why was MS-13 Targeted in Trump’s Speech?, N.Y.

Senator Dick Durbin, who was present at the January 11, 2018 meeting in the Oval \n2  Office, characterized the President’s comments as “clearly racial,” “hate-filled,” and “vile.”41 \n3  Senator Durbin reportedly warned the President that excluding immigrants based on those grounds \n4  would be “an obvious racial decision.”42 Secretary Nielsen, also present at the January 11, 2018 Oval \n5  Office meeting,43 acknowledged that the President used “tough language.”44 Although she claimed \n6  that she did not know whether Norway was a “predominately white country,” she admitted that she \n7  “imagine[d] that is the case.”45 \n8  92.  President Trump has repeatedly made disparaging remarks about people from Central \n9  America, including Honduras. \n10  93.  In February 2018, President Trump gave a speech at the annual Conservative Political \n11  Action Conference, where he used MS-13 to disparage immigrants more generally, comparing them \n12  to snakes and animals.46 Again, in May 2018 at an immigration roundtable discussion, President \n13  Trump relied on MS-13 to claim that undocumented immigrants “aren’t people. They are animals.”47 \n14  94.  On Twitter, President Trump lamented that Honduras is “doing nothing for the United \n15  States but taking our money.”48 \n16  95.  President Trump has also made disparaging remarks about certain South Asian \n17  countries and people, frequently relying on crude and derogatory stereotypes to stoke fear about \n18  immigration.  \n19                                                   \n41 Carl Hulse, Inside the Oval Office Immigration Meeting that Left a Senator Stunned, N.Y.

For example, while studying a map of the region in preparation for a meeting with the \n2  Prime Minister of India, the President deliberately “mispronounced Nepal as ‘nipple’ and laughingly \n3  referred to Bhutan as ‘button.’”49 The President is also “known to fake an Indian accent to imitate \n4  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during Oval Office meetings.”50 \n5  97.  President Trump has also expressed general animus toward other South Asian \n6  countries and individuals. \n7  98.  On October 5, 2016, President Trump gave a speech discussing how “our country is \n8  being infiltrated . . . by terrorists,” referring to “immigrants from high-risk regions.”51 \n9  99.  In August of 2016, then-candidate Trump gave speeches lamenting that the United \n10  States is not “smart” because of the “problem [of terrorism] across our refugee and immigration \n11  programs.” President Trump used an example of “two immigrants from Pakistan who later applied \n12  for and received U.S. citizenship” and who “were sentenced to decades long prison sentences for \n13  plotting to detonate a bomb” in New York City.52  \n14  100.  On June 13, 2016, President Trump remarked how the male shooter from San \n15  Bernardino, California “was the child of immigrants from Pakistan and he brought his wife – the \n16  other terrorist – from Saudi Arabia through another one of our easily exploited visa programs.”53 He \n17  further noted that immigration from Afghanistan is increasing and that “99% of people in \n18  Afghanistan support oppressive Sharia Law.

The President’s repeated statements denigrating immigrants, including many directed \n2  at immigrants from TPS-designated countries, were not merely hateful rhetoric. They were also a \n3  call to action.  \n4  102.  As described above, supra ¶¶ 43–46, 52–54, the White House repeatedly inserted \n5  itself at all levels of DHS’s decision-making on TPS to influence the process to favor termination. \n6  As the district court in Ramos found, “Acting Secretary Duke’s writing suggest that she, in her role \n7  at DHS, was largely carrying out or conforming with a predetermined presidential agenda to end \n8  TPS.”  \n9  103.  Similarly, as to then-Secretary Kelly, the district court found that his subordinates \n10  sought data on the number of TPS holders who committed crimes and relied on public assistance. \n11  “The information sought by the secretary coincides with racial stereotypes – i.e., that non-whites \n12  commit crimes and are on the public dole.” Indeed, the political surrogates working for then-\n13  Secretary Kelly knew the request for information was improper, so they requested that the \n14  preparation of the data be “kept quiet.” \n15  104.  The motivation and methods for terminating TPS designations reveal that the \n16  President’s documented animus for non-white, non-European immigrants infected the TPS decision-\n17  making process. \n18  DEPORTATION OF TPS HOLDERS WILL IMPOSE \n19  EXTRAORDINARY AND IRREPARABLE HARM ON TPS HOLDERS, THEIR MINOR \n20  U.S.-CITIZEN CHILDREN, AND THEIR COMMUNITIES \n21  105.  All told, approximately 400,000 TPS holders currently reside in the United States,55 \n22  approximately 86,000 of whom are Honduran TPS holders and 15,000 are Nepali TPS holders. TPS \n23  holders live in all fifty states, as well as in the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories.

California, residence to over 80,000 TPS \n2  holders, is home to the greatest number of TPS holders in the country.56 \n3  106.  Children born in the United States, including those born to TPS holders, are U.S. \n4  citizens with an absolute right to remain in the United States as guaranteed by the Fourteenth \n5  Amendment. \n6  107.  The wellbeing and future development of children are tied to nurturing and stable \n7  relationships with their parents.57 Science has empirically confirmed this intuitive understanding. \n8  The most important factor in the development of brain architecture—the trillions of connections \n9  among and across neurons in a child’s brain—is the interactive and responsive relationship between \n10  child and parent.58 The parent-child relationship promotes healthy brain development and provides \n11  the buffering protection necessary to prevent children from experiencing the toxic responses to \n12  stress.59 \n13  108.  Children of immigrants suffer acutely when their parents face even the possibility of \n14  deportation. Fear of deportation is directly tied to stress-related illness in children, including higher \n15  levels of anxiety and trauma, depression, and family instability. The “fear of massive deportations”60 \n16  also diminishes the quality of day-to-day relationships between parents and their children, in part \n17  because the threat of deportation deters parents from accompanying children to school or social \n18  events, seeking urgent or preventative health care for themselves and their children, pursuing \n19  opportunities for better housing, or reporting fraud, crimes, or abuse. \n20  109.  U.S.-citizen children of TPS holders, including the Plaintiff children in this case, \n21  confront an impossible choice. On the one hand, they may continue to live with their parents, but \n22  only if they relocate to a foreign country, leaving behind their schools, their communities, and the \n23 \n                                                 \n24  56 Wilson, supra at 12. \n57 CTR.

On the other hand, \n2  they may choose to remain in the United States, thereby forgoing the right to live with one or both of \n3  their parents, which, in many cases, would involve TPS-holder children becoming a ward of the \n4  state. \n5  110.  Plaintiff S.S., ten years old, is the eldest son of TPS holder Plaintiff Sumnima Thapa \n6  and her husband. S.S. was born in Minnesota, where he lives with his parents and younger brother. \n7  S.S. is in fifth grade and his favorite subjects are math, science, and gym. He loves science because \n8  he likes discovering things and doing experiments. S.S. is a yellow belt in karate and also enjoys \n9  playing soccer. If S.S. and his family were forced to leave the United States and move to Nepal he \n10  would miss his school and all of his friends. \n11  111.  Plaintiff G.D.P., nine years old, is the youngest daughter of TPS holder Plaintiff \n12  Donaldo Posadas Caceres. She was born in Maryland, where she lives with her parents and older \n13  siblings, and is now a fourth grade student. Her favorite subjects are math, reading, and gym. She \n14  loves learning new things, especially about history. Outside of school, G.D.P.’s favorite activities are \n15  playing games with her family and going out to eat together. She dreams of growing up to be \n16  President because she wants to help people who come here from other countries.  \n17  112.  The scale of the harm wrought by Defendants’ new TPS policies and practices is \n18  massive. TPS holders are the parents of more than 270,000 U.S.-citizen children.61 There are more \n19  than 50,000 U.S.-citizen children whose parents are Honduran or Nepali TPS holders.62 \n20  113.  But even beyond the parent-child relationship, TPS holders have built lives in the \n21  United States over the course of years or decades, establishing roots and contributing to their \n22  communities. The circumstances of the TPS-holder Plaintiffs in this case vividly illustrate the \n23  irreparable harm that will occur if they (and other TPS holders) lose their TPS standing. \n24  114.  Plaintiff Keshav Raj Bhattarai, fifty-six years old, was born in Nepal. Keshav’s home \n25  was significantly damaged in the April 2015 earthquake, and he and his wife had to sleep outside in \n26  a tent for about a month. In May 2015, Keshav and his wife traveled to the United States to see their \n27                                                   \n61 Warren & Kerwin, supra note 55, at 578. \n28  62 CTR. FOR AM.

About a month later, Nepal was designated for \n2  TPS and Keshav and his wife successfully applied for TPS status. Since receiving TPS, Keshav has \n3  worked in restaurants and gas stations. He currently lives in Sunnyvale, California, and works at a \n4  Chevron gas station, where he was recently promoted to assistant manager. His son is a doctor, \n5  trained in geriatrics and nephrology, and has lived and practiced in the United States for about ten \n6  years. \n7  115.  Plaintiff Sajjan Pandey, sixty-four years old, was born in Nepal. In Nepal, he used to \n8  run a restaurant and a technical school. Sajjan arrived in the United States in 2006, and has lived \n9  here ever since. He lives with his cousin, who is a U.S. citizen, in Alameda, California. He is an \n10  attendant and cashier at a Chevron gas station in Oakland, California. TPS is essential to his ability \n11  to work and support himself. He regularly sends money back to Nepal to help family members \n12  whose homes were damaged after the earthquake. Additionally, for the last twelve years Sajjan has \n13  been an active volunteer and leader of Motherland Nepal, a nonprofit cultural organization based in \n14  the Bay Area that creates cultural programming and fundraises for people in need. \n15  116.  Plaintiff Sumnima Thapa, thirty-five years old, was born in Nepal and arrived in the \n16  United States in 2002. She spent most of her childhood in Thailand, where she moved with her \n17  family at the age of four. Sumnima obtained her bachelor’s degree in business management from \n18  Saint Catherine’s College and her master’s degree in project management from Saint Mary’s \n19  University. Since March 2017, she has worked as a research specialist at Omni Data Retrieval, and \n20  she also previously volunteered with Lutheran Social Services. Sumnima lives in Apple Valley, \n21  Minnesota with her husband, also a TPS holder, and their two U.S.-citizen children, aged six and ten. \n22  Her youngest son has never been to Nepal, and her eldest son has visited Nepal only twice, once as \n23  an infant. Neither of Sumnima’s sons speak Nepali fluently. She and her husband own their home in \n24  Minnesota, and without TPS Sumnima will be unable to work and will have difficulty paying her \n25  mortgage. She is frightened to think about bringing her family back to Nepal, a country she barely \n26  knows and where few of her family members live. \n27  117.  Plaintiff Donaldo Posadas Caceres, forty-four years old, was born in Santa Rica \n28  Copan, Honduras. When he was young, in 1994, his brother was murdered in Honduras, leading \n26 \nCOMPLAINT – CASE NO. 19-CV-731 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00731   Document 1   Filed 02/10/19   Page 29 of 39\n1  Donaldo to drop out of school for his protection and move to another city. He, his wife, and his \n2  eldest son, who was then a baby, entered the United States in July 1998. They have held TPS since \n3  1999. Donaldo currently works as a bridge painter and is a member of the International Union of \n4  Painters and Allied Trades, commonly known as IUPAT. He owns his home in Baltimore, Maryland, \n5  where he lives with his wife and children. In addition to their eldest son, Donaldo and his wife have \n6  two U.S.-citizen daughters, aged eighteen and nine. His eldest daughter has been to Honduras only \n7  once, to visit her ailing grandfather, and his youngest daughter only twice, to visit her ailing \n8  grandfather and to attend her aunt’s funeral. \n9  118.  Plaintiff Sorayda Betzabe Rodriguez Motiño, thirty-six years old, was born in \n10  Honduras, where she was raised by her grandmother from a young age. A few days after Sorayda \n11  turned sixteen, she and her siblings came to the United States to look for their mother. They \n12  presented themselves at a port of entry on or around Christmas Eve of 1998 and Sorayda was placed \n13  in a shelter for unaccompanied minors. About two weeks later, Honduras was designated for TPS \n14  and Sorayda was released to her mother. She has held TPS ever since. Sorayda lives in \n15  Harrisonburg, Virginia with her husband, also a TPS holder, and two U.S.-citizen children. Her \n16  eldest child is autistic. She works at Great Eastern Resort as a supervisor of housekeeping. Sorayda \n17  is terrified at the thought of having to bring her children to Honduras, a place they have never been. \n18  Her children do not speak Spanish. \n19  119.  Plaintiff Denis Alen Molina Chavez, fifty-two years old, was born in Honduras. He \n20  entered the United States in July 1997 and has had TPS since 1999. After a short time in New Jersey, \n21  he settled in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where he has lived ever since. Denis is a widow and the single \n22  father of two U.S.-citizen children, a thirteen-year-old son and a twelve-year-old daughter. Denis’s \n23  wife passed away in 2013 from ovarian cancer. Denis is the lead pastor at the Church of Jude Mount \n24  Zion (Iglesia de Juda Monte de Sion) in Bridgeport, which has forty-five active members. He gives \n25  sermons on Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, in partnership with three assistant \n26  pastors, and provides religious teaching for children and youth. Denis has been a pastor since he was \n27  twenty-four years old and has been an active member of the church since he was a child. Denis also \n28  works as a mechanic at Service My Auto in Bridgeport, where he has been employed for the past \n27 \nCOMPLAINT – CASE NO. 19-CV-731 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00731   Document 1   Filed 02/10/19   Page 30 of 39\n1  eight years. Denis is very worried about what will happen to his life and the lives of his children if \n2  TPS is terminated. Denis is a homeowner; he and his wife bought their house less than a year and a \n3  half before she passed away. He relies on TPS to afford his mortgage, pay for the children’s \n4  necessities, to work, and to serve as a pastor. Connecticut is the only home his children have ever \n5  known. They have never been to Honduras. \n6  120.  TPS holders are an integral part of the economic and social fabric of American \n7  communities, and they give back to this country in countless ways. They are active in civic life and \n8  volunteer at schools, neighborhood and work organizations, and religious institutions.63 They pay \n9  federal, state, and local taxes, and support government social welfare programs. Experts estimate \n10  that without Honduran TPS holders alone, the U.S. Gross Domestic Product would shrink by at least \n11  $31.3 billion.64 \n12  121.  The net positive economic contributions of TPS holders are not surprising in light of \n13  their consistently high employment rate: eighty-five percent of Honduran TPS holders are employed. \n14  About seventeen percent are entrepreneurs, creating jobs not just for themselves but also for their \n15  communities.65 About thirty percent of TPS-holder households have mortgages, including 9,500 \n16  households with Honduran TPS holders.66 More than half of Honduran TPS holders have resided in \n17  the United States for twenty years or more.67 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n                                                 \n63 CELIA MEJÍVAR, CTR.

The proposed class satisfies the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n2  23(a)(1), because it is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. \n3  126.  On information and belief, there are tens of thousands of U.S.-citizen children of TPS \n4  holders from Honduras and Nepal. Given the dates of TPS designations for those countries, \n5  thousands of those children are minors confronted with the possibility of losing either the ability to \n6  live in their native country or the care and support of one or both parents. \n7  127.  Due to the actions of Defendants, unsupported by any legitimate government interest, \n8  U.S.-citizen children of TPS holders will be forced to choose between their absolute and \n9  fundamental due process right to reside in this country and their due process right to the care and \n10  support of their parents. \n11  128.  The class meets the commonality requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12  23(a)(2). Members of the class are subject to a common practice or policy: Defendants’ adoption of \n13  a new standard, unsupported by any legitimate government interest, that has caused the termination \n14  of the TPS designations for their parents’ respective countries without any consideration of the \n15  impact on the class members—i.e., these American children. If the TPS termination decisions take \n16  effect, these children will be forced by law to choose between their right to reside in this country as \n17  citizens and their right to reside with their parents. Whether the Due Process Clause permits the \n18  government to foist this choice upon these minor children presents a common legal question, \n19  resolution of which will greatly aid the efficient resolution of this case. \n20  129.  The proposed class meets the typicality requirements of Federal Rule of Civil \n21  Procedure 23(a)(3), because the claims of the Minor Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of their class. \n22  Minor Plaintiffs and the proposed class members are Honduran and Nepali TPS holders’ school-\n23  aged children, from ages five to eighteen, who are U.S. citizens. Their parents will be subject to \n24  removal once Defendants’ TPS termination decisions take effect. Minor Plaintiffs and their proposed \n25  class also share the same legal claims, which challenge the legality of Defendants’ termination \n26  policies and practices under the Fifth Amendment. \n27  130.  The proposed class meets the adequacy requirements of Federal Rule of Civil \n28  Procedure 23(a)(4). Minor Plaintiffs seek the same relief as the other members of the class. In \n30 \nCOMPLAINT – CASE NO. 19-CV-731 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00731   Document 1   Filed 02/10/19   Page 33 of 39\n1  defending their own rights, Minor Plaintiffs will defend the rights of all proposed class members \n2  fairly and adequately. \n3  131.  Additionally, the proposed class is represented by pro bono counsel from the National \n4  Day Laborer Organizing Network (“NDLON”), the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern \n5  California, Asian Americans Advancing Justice – Los Angeles, Asian Americans Advancing Justice \n6  – Asian Law Caucus, and Sidley Austin LLP. Plaintiffs’ counsel have extensive experience litigating \n7  class action lawsuits and other complex cases in federal court, including civil rights lawsuits on \n8  behalf of non-citizens. \n9  132.  The members of the class are readily ascertainable through Defendants’ records. \n10  133.  Finally, the proposed class satisfies Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(1)(A) and \n11  (b)(2). Competing rulings as to whether Defendants must permit the TPS-holding parents of minor \n12  U.S.-citizen children to reside in the United States could create inconsistent adjudications and \n13  establish incompatible standards of conduct governing Defendants’ behavior. In addition, \n14  Defendants have acted on grounds that are generally applicable to the class by terminating TPS \n15  designations for Honduras and Nepal without considering the massive harm the decisions cause to \n16  U.S.-citizen children or providing reasons to justify that harm. Thus, final injunctive and declaratory \n17  relief is appropriate for the class as a whole. \n18  CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n19  FIRST CLAIM \n20  Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act \n21  (Against All Defendants by All TPS-Holder Plaintiffs) \n22  134.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained \n23  in the preceding paragraphs. \n24  135.  The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 551 et seq., ensures that federal agencies \n25  are accountable to the public by providing a “right of review” to any “person suffering legal wrong \n26  because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action.” 5 U.S.C. 702. \n27  Judicial review is generally limited to “final agency action for which there is no other adequate \n28  remedy in a court.” 5 U.S.C. 704. \n31 \nCOMPLAINT – CASE NO. 19-CV-731 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00731   Document 1   Filed 02/10/19   Page 34 of 39\n1  136.  Among other things, the APA empowers federal courts to “hold unlawful and set \n2  aside agency actions, finding, and conclusions” that are “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, \n3  or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. 706(2)(A). The right of review under the APA \n4  includes a right to judicial review of “executive agency action for procedural correctness.” FCC v. \n5  Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 513 (2009).  \n6  137.  To engage in procedurally appropriate decision-making, an agency must ordinarily \n7  “display awareness that it is changing position,” and show “good reasons for the new policy.” Id. at \n8  515 (emphasis in original). Agencies may not “depart from a prior policy sub silentio.” Id. The APA \n9  requires an agency to provide even “more substantial justification” when “its prior policy has \n10  engendered serious reliance interests.” Id. \n11  138.  Defendants’ terminations of the TPS designations for Honduras and Nepal constitute \n12  “final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court” pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \n13  704, because Defendants’ termination decisions trigger TPS holders’ loss of TPS “automatically and \n14  without further notice or right of appeal,” 8 C.F.R. 244.19. \n15  139.  Defendants’ adoption of a new, drastically narrower interpretation of the TPS statute \n16  was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law in violation of the APA, because it represents a sudden \n17  and unexplained departure from decades of decision-making practices and ordinary procedures. By \n18  shifting, without explanation, the decision-governing standard for country designations, Defendants \n19  engaged in procedurally flawed decision-making. Further, Defendants changed their policy without \n20  accounting for the serious reliance interests that their prior policy had engendered. Fox Television \n21  Stations, 556 U.S. at 515. \n22  140.  Furthermore, Defendants’ conduct was also contrary to law, because Defendants’ new \n23  and drastically narrower interpretation of the TPS statute is erroneous. The TPS statute does not \n24  require the Secretary to consider only those country conditions that are directly related to the events \n25  that gave rise to the initial TPS designation. The TPS statute places no such constraints on a TPS \n26  decision, as years of prior decisions illustrate. “[I]t is black letter law that where an agency purports \n27  to act solely on the basis that a certain result is legally required, and that legal premise turns out to be \n28 \n32 \nCOMPLAINT – CASE NO. 19-CV-731 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00731   Document 1   Filed 02/10/19   Page 35 of 39\n1  incorrect, the action must be set aside . . . .” Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v.

Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury resulting from the arbitrary termination of the \n4  TPS designations. \n5  SECOND CLAIM \n6  Violation of the Equal Protection Guarantee of the \n7  Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment \n8  (Against All Defendants by All TPS-Holder Plaintiffs) \n9  142.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained \n10  in the preceding paragraphs. \n11  143.  The Fifth Amendment contains an implicit guarantee of equal protection that \n12  invalidates any official action that reflects a racially discriminatory intent or purpose. Classifications \n13  based on race or national origin are subject to exacting scrutiny, and even facially neutral policies \n14  and practices will be held unconstitutional when they reflect a pattern that is unexplainable on \n15  grounds other than race. Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499 (1954); Vill. of Arlington Heights v. \n16  Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 265–66 (1977). \n17  144.  Defendants’ decisions to terminate the TPS designations for Honduras and Nepal are \n18  unconstitutional because they were motivated, at least in part, by intentional discrimination based on \n19  race, ethnicity, or national origin. \n20  145.  Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury resulting from the arbitrary termination of the \n21  TPS designations. \n22  THIRD CLAIM \n23  Violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment \n24  (Against All Defendants by All TPS-Holder Plaintiffs) \n25  146.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained \n26  in the preceding paragraphs. \n27  147.  Due process protections extend to “all ‘persons’ within the United States, including \n28  [non-citizens], whether their presence here is lawful, unlawful, temporary, or permanent.” Zadvydas \n33 \nCOMPLAINT – CASE NO. 19-CV-731 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00731   Document 1   Filed 02/10/19   Page 36 of 39\n1  v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 693 (2001). TPS holders are lawfully present in this country. They have \n2  significant property and liberty interests, protected by the Due Process Clause, in a non-arbitrary \n3  decision as to the continuation of their TPS standing. Plaintiffs’ due process entitlement is based on \n4  both a property interest conferred by the TPS statute in remaining in the United States so long as \n5  their countries of origin are unsafe and a liberty interest based on their right under the TPS statute to \n6  live and work in the United States. \n7  148.  The “very essence” of Due Process is the “protection of the individual against \n8  arbitrary action.” Bd. of Regents of State Colls. v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 584 (1972). Any deprivation \n9  of liberty or property interests must, at the very least, pass a test of rationality. The burden on the \n10  government is greater when, as here, the liberty interests at stake derive from well-established and \n11  significant reliance interests. \n12  149.  Defendants have not articulated, and cannot establish, any rational basis for reversing \n13  course on decades of established TPS policy. \n14  150.  Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury resulting from the arbitrary termination of \n15  Honduras’s and Nepal’s TPS designations. \n16  FOURTH CLAIM \n17  Violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment \n18  (Against All Defendants by All U.S.-Citizen Children Plaintiffs) \n19  151.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained \n20  in the preceding paragraphs. \n21  152.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides \n22  that “[n]o person shall be . . . deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” U.S. \n23  Const. amend. V. The guarantee against the deprivation of liberty without due process bars the \n24  government from infringing on certain “fundamental” liberty interests, regardless of the procedures \n25  involved, unless the action is “narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.” Reno v. Flores, \n26  507 U.S. 292, 301–02 (1993). \n27  153.  Three such fundamental rights are implicated by Defendants’ actions. First, Plaintiffs \n28  who are school-aged U.S. citizens have an absolute right to live in the United States. To compel \n34 \nCOMPLAINT – CASE NO. 19-CV-731 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00731   Document 1   Filed 02/10/19   Page 37 of 39\n1  them to live abroad at any time, let alone in their formative years, would deny them a core aspect of \n2  their liberty protected by the Fifth Amendment. See, e.g., Nguyen v. I.N.S., 533 U.S. 53, 67 (2001); \n3  Ng Fung Ho v. White, 259 U.S. 276, 284 (1922). \n4  154.  Second, for at least so long as these U.S.-citizen Plaintiffs remain minors, they have a \n5  fundamental right protected by both the First and Fifth Amendments to live with and be raised by \n6  their parents. E.g., Moore v. City of East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 499 (1977); Board of Dirs. v. \n7  Rotary Club, 481 U.S. 537, 545 (1987). \n8  155.  Third, Defendants’ decisions to end the lawful immigration status of their parents \n9  impinges upon the U.S.-citizen Plaintiffs’ constitutionally protected liberty interests. These \n10  American children have an interest in not being compelled to choose between two alternatives, when \n11  each alternative will deprive them of a substantial, constitutionally protected aspect of their liberty. \n12  See United States v. Jackson, 390 U.S. 570 (1968); cf. New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 176 \n13  (1992). \n14  156.  In invading these fundamental constitutional rights, Defendants have articulated no \n15  substantial government interest. Defendants may not lawfully deprive U.S.-citizen Plaintiffs of these \n16  fundamental constitutional rights, as their actions advance no legitimate government interest. See \n17  Smith v. City of Fontana, 818 F.2d 1411, 1419-20 (9th Cir. 1987) (holding that the government may \n18  not interfere in the protected interest of family relations without demonstrating a legitimate interest), \n19  overruled on other grounds by Hodgers-Durgin v. de la Vina, 199 F.3d 1037, 1040 n.1 (9th Cir. \n20  1999). \n21  157.  U.S.-citizen Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury resulting from the termination of \n22  the TPS designations. \n23  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n24  Individual Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and others similar situated, ask this Court to \n25  grant the following relief:  \n26  1.  Declare that Defendants’ termination of the TPS designations for Honduras and \n27  Nepal was unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and unlawful \n28  under the Administrative Procedure Act; \n35 \nCOMPLAINT – CASE NO. 19-CV-731 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00731   Document 1   Filed 02/10/19   Page 38 of 39\n1  2.  Vacate Defendants’ unlawful termination of the TPS designations for Honduras and \n2  Nepal; \n3  3.  Enjoin and restrain all Defendants, and their officers, agents, servants, employees, \n4  attorneys, and all other persons who are in active concert or participation with any of them, from \n5  implementing or enforcing the decisions to terminate the TPS designations for Honduras and Nepal; \n6  4.  Alternatively, certify this case as a class action lawsuit as proposed herein, appoint \n7  Individual Minor Plaintiffs G.D.P. and S.S. as class representatives of their class, and the \n8  undersigned counsel as class counsel; \n9  5.  And enjoin and restrain all Defendants, and their officers, agents, servants, \n10  employees, attorneys, and all other persons who are in active concert or participation with any of \n11  them, from rescinding the immigration status of those TPS holders who have school-aged U.S.-\n12  citizen children for so long as the children remain age five to eighteen; \n13  6.  Grant an award of attorneys’ fees and costs; and \n14  7.  Grant any other and further relief that this Court may deem fit and proper. \n15   \n16   \n17  Dated: February 10, 2019  Respectfully submitted, \n18    SIDLEY AUSTIN LLP \n19  /s/ Alycia A.

Nielsen, No. 18-01554, including through any additional appellate channels in which relief may \n5  be sought, or (b) other order of this Court.   \n6  The basis for this stipulation is as follows: \n7  1.  On April 26, 2018, the Secretary of Homeland Security announced the termination \n8  of Temporary Protected Status (“TPS”) for Nepal effective June 24, 2019. See 83 FR 23705 (May \n9  22, 2018). On May 4, 2018, the Secretary of Homeland Security also announced the termination \n10  of TPS for Honduras effective January 5, 2020. See 83 FR 26074 (June 5, 2018). Plaintiffs have \n11  brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act and the Fifth Amendment relating to those \n12  terminations. Defendants believe the Court lacks jurisdiction over this matter and, otherwise, \n13  believe the terminations were conducted in accordance with all applicable laws.   \n14  2.  Plaintiffs’ claims are very similar to the claims raised by the plaintiffs in Ramos, \n15  relating to termination of TPS for El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Sudan. Defendants believe \n16  the Court in Ramos lacks subject matter jurisdiction and that the terminations at issue in that case \n17  were conducted in accordance with all applicable laws.    \n18  3.  On October 3, 2018, in Ramos, this Court issued an order preliminarily enjoining \n19  and restraining Defendants “from engaging in, committing, or performing, directly or indirectly, \n20  by any means whatsoever, implementation and/or enforcement of the decisions to terminate \n21  [Temporary Protected Status (“TPS”)] for Sudan, Haiti, El Salvador, and Nicaragua pending \n22  resolution of this case on the merits.” See Ramos Order [ECF No. 128] at 42. Further, this Court \n23  ordered Defendants to report within 15 days on the “administrative steps” Defendants would take \n24  or have taken to comply with the preliminary injunction. See id. at 43.  \n25  4.  On October 11, 2018, Defendants appealed the preliminary injunction in Ramos to \n26  the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Ramos [ECF No. 129]. Briefing is now complete, \n27  and the parties expect the case to be scheduled for argument in the coming months.  \n28 \n1 \nSTIPULATION TO STAY PROCEEDINGS - CASE NO. 3:19-cv-00731-EMC \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00731-EMC   Document 22   Filed 03/12/19   Page 4 of 8\n \n1  5.  Further, on October 23, 2018, pursuant to this Court’s Order, Defendants reported \n2  on the administrative steps they had undertaken and planned to undertake in response to the \n3  Ramos preliminary injunction. See, e.g., Ramos, Declaration of Donald Neufeld [ECF No. 135-1]. \n4  In addition, Defendants stipulated that TPS for the four countries would remain in effect during \n5  the pendency of the appeal. See Ramos, Stipulation to Stay Proceedings [ECF No. 138] ¶ 6(c). \n6  Defendants also stated that, in the event the preliminary injunction were reversed on appeal, any \n7  termination of TPS for Sudan, Haiti, El Salvador, and Nicaragua would go into effect no sooner \n8  than 120 days from the issuance of any appellate mandate to this Court. See Ramos, Declaration of \n9  Donald Neufeld [ECF No. 135-1] ¶ 10; Ramos, Stipulation to Stay Proceedings [ECF No. 138] ¶ \n10  6.  \n11  6.  The parties’ disputes in this case are similar to, and will be informed by, the disputes \n12  being litigated in Ramos. The interests of justice and judicial economy would be served by treating \n13  the decisions terminating TPS for Honduras and Nepal similarly to the decisions at issue in Ramos \n14  during the pendency of the Ramos appeal. Specifically, Defendants hereby stipulate that they will \n15  not “engag[e] in, commit[], or perform[], directly or indirectly, by any means whatsoever, \n16  implementation and/or enforcement of the decisions to terminate [Temporary Protected Status \n17  (“TPS”)] for” Honduras and Nepal, pending resolution of the appeal in Ramos, see Ramos, Order \n18  [ECF No. 128] at 42, or by other order of the Court. Defendants reserve the right to move the \n19  Court to lift this stay if the appellate decision in Ramos suggests a basis on which to distinguish \n20  the Honduras and Nepal TPS terminations from the TPS terminations at issue in Ramos.   \n21  7.  Defendants further stipulate that they will take steps with respect to TPS holders \n22  from Honduras and Nepal equivalent to those that they agreed to take with respect to the TPS \n23  holders at issue in Ramos. These include that TPS for Honduras and Nepal will remain in effect \n24  during the pendency of this stay, that DHS will periodically issue Federal Register Notices \n25  automatically extending by nine-months the appropriate TPS-related documentation for TPS \n26  beneficiaries from Honduras and Nepal, with the first such notice to issue for TPS beneficiaries \n27  from Nepal approximately forty five (45) days prior to June 24, 2019, and for TPS beneficiaries \n28  from Honduras approximately forty five (45) days prior to January 5, 2020.  These steps also \n2 \nSTIPULATION TO STAY PROCEEDINGS - CASE NO. 3:19-cv-00731-EMC \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00731-EMC   Document 22   Filed 03/12/19   Page 5 of 8\n \n1  include in adjudicating late re-registration notices for TPS holders from Honduras and Nepal, \n2  USCIS adjudicators will give presumptive weight to whether the delay in filing for re-registration \n3  was due in whole or part to the termination notices. See Ramos, Stipulation to Stay Proceedings \n4  [ECF No. 138] ¶ 6; Declaration of Donald W. Neufeld ¶¶ 9, 16. Further, the parties agree that, in \n5  the event the Ramos preliminary injunction is reversed on appeal, any termination of TPS for \n6  Honduras or Nepal will go into effect no sooner than 120 days from the issuance of any appellate \n7  mandate to this Court or, to the extent Defendants move this Court to vacate the stay, 180 days \n8  from vacatur of the stay by this Court. In addition, for TPS beneficiaries subject to this stipulation, \n9  Defendants will take measures consistent with 8 U.S.C. § 1254a(c) and the Ramos agreement to \n10  ensure the beneficiaries’ continued TPS eligibility and the continued validity of TPS-related \n11  documentation. See Ramos, Declaration of Donald Neufeld [ECF No. 135-1]; Ramos, Stipulation \n12  to Stay Proceedings [ECF No. 138]. \n13  8.  The parties also stipulate to a stay of the proceedings in this case. Therefore, in \n14  addition to staying production of the administrative records in this case, neither side will seek \n15  discovery during the pendency of that stay. During the stay, Plaintiffs will seek no relief from this \n16  Court beyond any relief needed to enforce the terms of this agreement, and Defendants will not \n17  move to dismiss this case.  \n18  9.   Both sides reserve the right to pursue any arguments in support of their positions \n19  upon expiration of this agreement, including but not limited to Defendants’ arguments that this \n20  Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, that, if there is jurisdiction, then review should be limited \n21  to the administrative record, and any other argument that either side could have made at this stage \n22  of the litigation had they not agreed to this stipulation and stay.          \n23  10.  This Court has the authority to issue a stay of proceedings pending the appeal in the \n24  related Ramos case: “[T]he power to stay proceedings is incidental to the power inherent in every \n25  court to control the disposition of the causes of its docket with economy of time and effort for \n26  itself, for counsel, and for litigants.” Landis v. N. Am. Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254-55 (1936).  \n27  11.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs and Defendants, through counsel, stipulate and request the \n28  Court to order as follows: \n3 \nSTIPULATION TO STAY PROCEEDINGS - CASE NO. 3:19-cv-00731-EMC \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00731-EMC   Document 22   Filed 03/12/19   Page 6 of 8\n \n1  (a)  Further proceedings on the merits of this case, including discussions about, \n2  and entry of, a schedule for resolving Defendants’ motion to dismiss and Plaintiffs’ motion \n3  for preliminary injunction, shall be stayed pending final resolution of Defendants’ appeal of \n4  the preliminary injunction in Ramos, including through any additional appellate channels in \n5  which relief may be sought, or by other order of this Court.   \n6  (b)  In the event that the Ramos preliminary injunction is affirmed in whole or \n7  part after all appellate channels have been exhausted, the parties anticipate resuming \n8  litigation in this Court. In the event that the preliminary injunction is reversed on a ground \n9  that does not foreclose further discovery, nothing in this agreement forecloses Plaintiffs \n10  from initiating discovery forthwith, nor does anything in this agreement foreclose \n11  Defendants from opposing such discovery. Plaintiffs need not wait until the mandate issues \n12  before initiating discovery in such a situation. \n13  (c)  Following the conclusion of the appeal of the preliminary injunction, TPS \n14  will remain in effect for Honduras and Nepal for a minimum of the latter of a) 120 days \n15  following the issuance of any mandate to the district court, or b) the Secretary’s previously-\n16  announced effective date for the termination of TPS designations for each individual \n17  country (Nepal – June 24, 2019; Honduras – January 5, 2020). To the extent that \n18  Defendants move to vacate the stay in light of an appellate decision affirming the \n19  preliminary injunction in Ramos that suggests a basis on which to distinguish the Honduras \n20  and Nepal TPS terminations from the TPS terminations at issue in Ramos, TPS will remain \n21  in effect for Honduras and Nepal for at least 180 days following an order of this Court \n22  vacating the stay. \n23  (d)  As in Ramos, nothing in this stipulation prevents Plaintiffs from presenting \n24  to the Court for resolution any issues concerning Defendants’ compliance with Defendants’ \n25  plan to implement the Ramos preliminary injunction, Ramos, [ECF No. 135-1], or with the \n26  terms of this stipulation. Should either side for any reason fail to comply with the terms of \n27  this stipulation, each side reserves the right to request that the Court lift this stay.
