For one thing, I want to know what the City's plans are with respect to moving to dismiss the complaint. For another, I want to explore whether a significant portion of this case does not need to be severed and moved to the Northern District of New York. Cases involving allegation of brutality by corrections officers located in the NDNY are litigated in the NDNY, not in NYC. Adding allegations that the City is somehow responsible for that brutality because it transferred the plaintiffs to Albany knowing that they would/might be abused does not change that. All that means is that there is some overlap is discovery. But I cannot for the life of me see why I should be litigating the conditions in the Albany County Jail down here.

Therefore, I am severing from the City Defendants' motion to dismiss the discrete issue of failure to exhaust, and I hereby convert that issue, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, to a motion for summary judgment. See also Arnold v. Goetz, 245 F. Supp. 2d 527, 541 (S.D.N.Y. 2003). Officials at Rikers and ACCF have five business days from the date of this opinion to produce to Plaintiffs' counsel relevant records concerning both the existence and particulars of grievance processes at their respective institutions and any record of any filing of any grievance or appeal pursuant to those procedures that relates to the allegations of the Amended Complaint. If the City Defendants wish to depose Plaintiffs on the limited issue of exhaustion, they must so notify the court by Friday, March 22, 2019. Mr. Espinal will be writted into New York County for deposition if one is to be taken - although I gather that he has been deposed in connection with a 50-h hearing. Moving Defendants have five business days after the completion of any depositions, or five business days after the production of records if there are no such depositions, to supplement their motion on the issue of exhaustion. Plaintiffs have ten business days thereafter to supplement their response on the issue of exhaustion and availability. Moving Defendants have five business days thereafter to file a reply. All other motions will be held in abeyance pending the resolution of the exhaustion issue. (Signed by Judge Colleen McMahon on 3/15/2019) (mml) (Entered: 03/15/2019)"

David Soares from Chief Judge Colleen McMahon dated 5/3/2019 re: Attached to this letter you will find a copy of the First Amended Complaint filed in this court in the civil action styled Davon Washington el al., v. The City of New York, et al., 18 Civ. 12306 (CM). Earlier this week, I entered a decision and order denying motions to dismiss, sever or transfer this action. I am of the opinion of this court that certain matters alleged in the attached pleading, which contains serious allegations of the deliberate abuse of youthful pre-trial detainees, should be investigated by law enforcement. I emphasize that this court has yet to make any findings about the veracity of these allegations. The civil action presently pending before me is at a preliminary stage, and the allegations of the complaint -- which had to be presumed true for purposes of the recently-decided motions -- have not yet been tested in the cauldron of pre-trial discovery. However, some of the allegations in the attached pleading concerning the treatment of the four named defendants - particularly, though not exclusively, those relating to their treatment at the Albany County Correctional Facility - are of such seriousness that I believe they should be investigated at the earliest opportunity. Hence I am making this referral at an earlier stage that I might otherwise. I thank you for your attention to this matter. (Signed by Judge Colleen McMahon on 5/3/2019) Copies Mailed By Chambers.

    "summary": "<p>On December 28, 2018, four pre-trial detainees filed this putative class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs sued the New York City Department of Corrections (DOC), the Albany County Correctional Facility, and the Albany County Sheriff's Office under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, sought declaratory and injunctive relief, damages, and attorney's fees. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants violated their First Amendment, Fourth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment rights and committed assault and battery during their transfer from Rikers Island to the Albany County Correctional Facility. </p><p>In separate instances, all four plaintiffs were detained at Rikers Island when they were transferred to the Albany County Correctional Facility. The correctional officers did not provide the plaintiffs with a reason for their transfer or notify their families or attorneys. The plaintiffs shared similar experiences upon arrival at the Albany County Correctional Facility. Plaintiffs alleged that the correctional officers at the facility severely beat and sexually assaulted them while they were being processed for intake. While shackled and handcuffed, several officers kicked and stomped on the plaintiffs until they were unconscious. After, the plaintiffs were forced to remove their clothing and follow a series of detailed instructions. If they did not properly comply, the defendants would assault them. The defendants accused all plaintiffs of carrying contraband in their rectums and an officer would then proceed to digitally assault them. In some instances, the plaintiffs were continually tasered and beaten after their strip searches. The plaintiffs claimed that the Albany County Correctional Facility reported each assault as a disciplinary infraction and accused each plaintiff of attacking staff members inside the booking cell. Afraid of retaliation, the plaintiffs did not testify during their disciplinary hearings and were sentenced to nine to ten months in punitive segregation.  </p><p>On January 28, 2019, plaintiffs' counsel filed a motion for preliminary injunction on behalf of one detainee who remained in the custody of the Albany County Correctional Facility. They requested: (1) for the court to transfer the plaintiff to a correctional facility in New York City operated by DOC while the case was pending and until his release; (2) in the alternative, to remove him from punitive segregation at the Albany County Correctional Facility; or (3) temporarily release him from punitive segregation, provide a new disciplinary hearing that has minimum due process standards, and give him access to unmonitored legal telephone calls with counsel throughout the pendency of the lawsuit. The next day, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that provided class allegations and requested class certification. </p><p>The New York City Department of Corrections moved to dismiss and sought to join the State Commission of Corrections (SCOC) as a defendant. The City defendants argued that the lawsuit should be dismissed on grounds that: (1) the plaintiffs failed to exhaust in accordance with the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA); (2) liability for any constitutional violations regarding transfers to Albany should be directed to the SCOC, thus, the case should be dismissed for failing to join a necessary party; (3) the plaintiffโs claim for permanent injunctive relief should be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction; and (4) the plaintiffs failed to state a claim on all twenty-two causes of action that implicated the City defendants. Shortly thereafter, the Albany County Sheriffโs Office defendants and a defendant who worked as a nurse in the Albany County Correctional Facility both filed motions to sever and transfer the claims directed against them from the claims against the City defendants to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York. </p><p>On March 28, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a motion to certify a class that consisted of all pretrial detainees who were or would be detained at the Albany County Correctional Facility pursuant to substitute jail orders obtained by the City of New York. On April 4, 2019, Chief Judge Colleen McMahon explained that she would not be considering the issue of class certification any time soon, given the other motions. In Judge McMahon's decision and order on April 30, 2019, she denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, the City defendant's motion to dismiss, and the Albany County defendants' motion to sever and order to transfer. 2019 WL 212052.</p><p>On June 6, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint that addressed pending custody status of several plaintiffs who no longer were in custody at the Albany County Correctional Facility. On June 12, 2019, Judge McMahon issued an order that granted the Albany County defendants' request for a stay until August 31, 2019, for one of the correctional officers on military leave. </p><p>On June 27, 2019 the case was referred to Magistrate Judge Stewart D. Aaron for settlement talks. The Corrections Officers Benevolent Association formally requested to participate on July 5, 2019. Its request was denied on July 9, 2019: it was not party to the case, and none of the parties consented to its participation. </p><p>On July 16, 2019, a settlement conference was held. Settlement talks then continued, and the case was stayed. On October 18, the parties reached a settlement agreement. </p><p>The City of New York agreed to pay three individual plaintiffs $75,000, plus their pro rata shares of attorneys' fees. The County of Albany did the same, in addition to paying a fourth plaintiff $220,000. The plaintiffs obtained a total of $310,000 in attorneys' fees. The settlement also specified that the City of New York would not seek substitute jail orders to transfer anyone in the NYC DOC to the Albany County Correctional Facility from the date of the agreement to December 31, 2021. </p><p>Persons being transferred outside of the City of New York upon a substitute jail order would be given a notice stating:<blockquote>โa. Where the inmate is being transferred: b. That the transfer is pursuant to a substitute jail order; c. The reason for the transfer; d. That the inmate will be brought back to New York City for court dates; e. That the inmate will be subject to the rules and regulations of the new jail, including rules about visiting; f. That the new jail is governed by New York Stateโs Minimum Standards for Management of County Jails; g. That the inmate has the right to make phone calls to the inmateโs lawyer; and h. That if the inmate wants to talk to his lawyer to let them know where they are being moved the inmate, he/she should ask the staff at the new jail.โ</blockquote>Additionally, from January 1, 2022 โ December 31, 2023, any persons New York City DOC housed in Albany County Correctional Facility would be subject to the limits on punitive segregation contained in 40 R.C.N.Y  ยงยง 1-17(a-g), including age restrictions and enhanced due process protections like the ability to call witnesses at infraction hearings. </p><p>The case was dismissed with prejudice on October 21, 2019 pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement, but the court retained jurisdiction to enforce the agreement. </p><p></p>",

They alleged that the defendants violated their First Amendment, Fourth Amendment, and Fourteenth Amendment rights and committed assault and battery when they beat and sexually assaulted the plaintiffs during processing.

Early one morning, without warning, a van comes to the jail for the young \nmen.  They have been in that jail for months or even years, but they have not been convicted of \nany crimes. \n2.  The young men are shackled and put in the back of the van.  The van has \nno windows.  They do not know where they are going. \n3.  The van drives for hours.  It eventually comes to a stop at the end of a road \nat the back of an airfield.  The doors open in a place the young men have never seen before.   \n4.  A dozen guards in green fatigues and body armor are there waiting.  They \ntell the young men to get out of the van one by one.  The guards take the young men inside a \nbuilding and put them in cages.   \n5.  The guards deliver commands that are bizarrely detailed and confusing.  \nTake off your shirt with your right hand and pass it backward over your left shoulder, they say.  \nWhen the young men, disoriented, get it wrong, the guards โrespondโ with blows and punches. \n6.  The guards yell that the young men are hiding things in their bodies.  They \npunch and kick the young men.  Get it out, the guards say.  The guards curse and threaten to kill \nthem.  Get it out, the guards demand.  Some of the young men are shot with tasers in-between \nbeatings.  Guards insert their fingers and batons into the young menโs rectums.  We will get it out \nfor you, they threaten.  The young men lie naked on the floor, crying, pleading, covered in their \nown urine and feces.  Get it out, get it out.  The guards will not stop. \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 6 of 103\n \n7.  The commander finally tells the guards that it is enough.  The guards \nleave.  The young men are left in cages, alone.  They sit there by themselves around the clock, in \nisolation, for weeks, months, even years. \n8.  There are no rules, no procedures, and no laws in this place.  The young \nmen are far from their families, far from their lawyers, cut off from the outside world.  They fear \nthat they could be killed at any moment and no one would know what happened to them.  Their \nfear is not unreasonable: that is what the guards tell them might happen. \n9.  These young men are not in the custody of a repressive foreign regime; \nthey are not suspected terrorists rendered by the CIA.  The โblack siteโ to which they have been \ntaken without warning is not a decrepit Iraqi prison or an air base in the Polish countryside.  \nThey are pretrial detainees in the custody of the City of New York, and the black site is the \nAlbany County Correctional Facility. \n10.  This case is about young men from New York City who have been \nshipped up to Albany County to be beaten and punished for crimes they have not been convicted \nof committing.  It is about the Cityโs policy of knowingly sending these young men to Albany to \nbe tortured; it is about Albany Countyโs policy of torturing them; and it is about the correction \nofficers who carry out the torture. \n11.  More than anything else, however, this case is about the rest of us, living \noutside the jail walls.  It is about the authority that is being quietly exercisedโand viciously \nabusedโon our behalf.   \n12.  We, the People, have decided through our Constitution that not even the \nmost despised detainees may be tortured.  Not even someone who has assaulted a correction \nofficer.  Not even an alleged gang member.  Not even someone who is hiding contraband in his \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 7 of 103\n \nbody.  We are a society of laws, and due processโthe idea that sets us apart from repressive \nregimes worldwideโforbids this. \n13.  In New York City, the law forbids subjecting teenage pretrial detainees to \n23 or 24-hour solitary confinement, even if the teenagers are difficult to control, break rules, or \nhurt others.  Locking college-age young men in cages for 23 hours a day with no human contact \nis not just cruel.  It is a form of torture.  It does not reduce violence or promote jail safety.  It \nsimply inflicts permanent damage on developing minds too young to be beyond redemption. \n14.  Our commitment to due process and the rule of law binds us even when it \nis hard.  It governs even in the darkest corners of far-away jails and it protects evenโindeed, \nespeciallyโthe least popular, the most reviled of our fellow human beings. \n15.  People are being tortured in our names.  This time it is happening much \ncloser to home, and it is happening to Americans.  It is time for the torture to stop.  It is time to \nbring these young men home to New York City. \nPARTIES \n \n16.  Plaintiff Davon Washington is a 22-year-old man who resides in the \nBronx, New York.

Plaintiffs demand trial by jury.  \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nI.  New York Cityโs Ban on Solitary Confinement for Young People \n \n29.  In August 2014, the United States Department of Justice (โDOJโ) issued \nan investigative report on conditions at Rikers Island.  DOJ found, among other things, that the \nCity improperly relied on solitary confinement as a tool to manage adolescent detainees, \nโexpos[ing] them to a risk of serious harmโ and raising serious constitutional concerns.  DOJ \nfound that putting adolescents in solitary created a โvicious cycle.โ  Disruptive and unstable \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 12 of 103\n \ndetainees became more disruptive and unstable when they were put in solitary, isolated from \nsocial support and necessary services, and given little incentive to improve their behavior.1 \n30.  In October 2014, the New Yorker told the story of Kalief Browder, who \nspent three years on Rikers Island as a teenager after being accused of stealing a backpack.2  \nKalief spent nearly 17 consecutive months in solitary confinement before the charges against \nhim were dismissed.  While in solitary, he became paranoid and repeatedly attempted suicide.  \nAfter he got out, he had constant flashbacks to his time in solitary and made more suicide \nattempts.  Kalief killed himself less than a year after the article appeared. \n31.  Both developments brought public attention to the Cityโs gross \noverreliance on solitary confinement for young pretrial detainees.  And they happened against a \nbackdrop of growing societal recognition of the harm of solitary confinement, particularly for \nyoung people. \n32.  There is clear scientific consensus that long-term solitary confinement \ninflicts grave psychiatric injury.  According to the American Psychiatric Association, solitary is \nassociated with increased risk of self-mutilation and suicidal ideation, greater anxiety, \ndepression, and paranoia.3  About half of all prison suicides happen among the roughly 5 to 6 \npercent of inmates held in solitary.4 \n                                                        \n1   See U.S. Depโt of Justice, CRIPA Investigation of the New York City Department of Correction Jails on \nRikers Island, Aug. 4, 2014, https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/usao-sdny/legacy/2015/03/25/SDNY \n%20Rikers%20Report.pdf. \n2   Jennifer Gonnerman, Before the Law, The New Yorker, Oct. 6, 2014, https://www.newyorker.com \n/magazine/2014/10/06/before-the-law. \n3   Solitary Confinement of Juvenile Offenders, Am Psych. Assโn, https://www.apa.org/advocacy/criminal-\njustice/solitary.pdf. \n4   Am. Civ. Liberties Union, Caged In: Solitary Confinementโs Devastating Harm on Prisoners with Physical \nDisabilities 25 (2017), https://www.aclu.org/report/caged-devastating-harms-solitary-confinement-prisoners-\nphysical-disabilities. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 13 of 103\n \n33.  Cognition tends to deteriorate in solitary.  Many people held in solitary \nexperience hallucinations and delusions, and some suffer full-blown psychosis, losing touch with \nthe world around them.  One eminent psychologist and criminologist has described the isolated \ndetaineesโ mental state as โisolation panicโโa feeling of desperation, abandonment, and \nhelplessness that feeds rage, panic, and loss of control.5   \n34.  These risks are particularly acute for young people.  Immature adolescent \nbrains are even less well equipped than fully developed adult brains to handle the rigors of \nprolonged isolation.  A 2014 study of detainees in New York City jails found that the two biggest \npredictors of self-harm were being under age 19 and having been placed in solitary confinement \nat least once.6 \n35.  Solitary also poses unique threats to young people.  Some serious mental \nillnesses, like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, do not typically manifest themselves until a \nperson is in her early-to-mid-20s.  Solitary confinement can provoke or accelerate the onset of \nthese serious mental illnesses for teenage detainees. \n36.  Recent developments in constitutional law recognize that the penal system \nmust treat teenagers differently than adults because their immature brains function differently.7 \n37.  In this context, in January 2015, the New York City Board of Correction \n(the โBoardโ) adopted a regulation banning solitary confinement (or โpunitive segregationโ) for \ndetainees age 21 and younger in New York City (the โUnder Age 22 Solitary Banโ). \n                                                        \n5   Hans Toch, Mosaic of Despair: Human Breakdowns in Prison (1992). \n6   Fatos Kaba et al., Solitary Confinement and Risk of Self-Harm Among Jail Inmates, 104 Am.

The Board is an independent body of the City that is responsible for \noverseeing and evaluating the performance of DOC.  The Board is required to establish \nMinimum Standards for the treatment of detainees held by the City.8  Those Minimum Standards \nare regulations with binding legal effect, codified in the Rules of the City of New York, which \nDOC is obligated to follow.9 \n39.  In promulgating the Under Age 22 Solitary Ban, the Board found: \nโ[P]unitive segregation is a severe penalty that should not be used in certain circumstances in \n[DOC] facilities.  In particular, punitive segregation reflects a serious threat to the physical and \npsychological health of adolescents, with respect to whom it should not be imposed.โ10 \n40.  The Under Age 22 Solitary Ban immediately forbid the placement of \ndetainees under age 18 in solitary.  It further provided that, as of January 1, 2016, detainees ages \n18 through 21 โshall be excludedโ from solitary, โprovided that sufficient resources are made \navailable to [DOC] for necessary staffing and implementation of necessary alternative \nprogramming.โ11 \n41.  The Under Age 22 Solitary Ban received glowing press coverage and \npraise from advocates for detaineesโ rights.  Mayor de Blasio trumpeted that the City would now \nโbe at the forefront of national jail reform efforts.โ12 \n42.  In July 2015, the City submitted to a consent decree in Nunez v. City of \nNew York designed to reduce excessive force by officers against detainees on Rikers Island, \n                                                        \n8   See Charter of the City of New York ยง 626. \n9   Rules of the City of New York tit. 40. \n10   Id. tit. 40 ยง 1-17(a) (emphasis added). \n11   Id. tit. 40 ยง 1-17(b)(1)(ii). \n12   See, e.g., Mark Berman, New York City Will No Longer Put Its Youngest Prison Inmates in Solitary \nConfinement, Wash.

To that end, the City agreed in the \nconsent decree to additional reforms relating to solitary confinement for young people.13    \n43.  In practice, however, DOC has long been reluctant to reduce its use of \nsolitary confinement and has resisted implementing the Under Age 22 Solitary Ban.14  For a very \nlong time, solitary confinement had been a primary tool used at Rikers Island to deal with \nviolent, mentally ill, or difficult young inmates.15  Long-serving senior DOC officials, rank-and-\nfile staff, and the correction officersโ union were slow to embrace reform. \n44.  After the Under Age 22 Solitary Ban was passed, DOC requested and \nreceived a series of variances from the Board to delay the implementation of the ban on solitary \nfor detainees aged 18 to 21.  DOC claimed it needed more time to develop alternative \nprogramming. \n45.  Finally, in October 2016, the Board determined that DOC had been \nprovided with sufficient resources to implement alternative programming, and the variances \nended.  For the past two years, it has been unlawful for the City to keep a detainee under the age \nof 22 in solitary confinement. \n46.  Regulations passed by the Board also limit the amount of time DOC \ndetainees over age 21 can spend in solitary confinement.  For example, an adult detainee cannot \nspend more than 30 consecutive days in solitary confinement unless he has been sentenced for a \n                                                        \n13   See Consent Decree ยง XVI, Nunez v. City of New York, No. 11-CV-5845 (S.D.N.Y.

The maximum sentence for a serious assault on staff is 60 \ndays in solitary confinement.16 \n47.  Even with the Under Age 22 Solitary Ban in effect and the limits on \nsolitary for adults, DOCโone of the largest jail systems in the worldโstill has powerful tools at \nits disposal to manage, isolate, and control difficult detainees to the extent it deems necessary. \n48.  The regulation passed by the Board in 2015 also forbid detainees between \n18 and 21 from being placed in โEnhanced Supervision Housingโ (โESHโ), a secure unit that is \nless restrictive than solitary (the โUnder Age 22 ESH Banโ).17  Detainees in ESH are entitled to \nat least seven hours outside their cells each day, during which they can socialize with other \ndetainees.  They can also receive some social visitors, and they have access to services and \nprograms accessible to detainees in the general population, including education and chaplains.18 \n49.  Since the Under Age 22 ESH Ban was passed, DOC has continuously \nrequested and received variances from the Board waiving its compliance with this requirement.  \nTherefore, it is currently permissible for DOC to send detainees between ages 18 and 21 to ESH, \nwhich is the most restrictive setting for detainees in that age group in DOC custody. \n50.    DOC maintains a restrictive housing unit at its West Facility on Rikers \nIsland, which, on information and belief, is designed to accommodate violent detainees who have \nnot been adequately controlled in other settings, as well as detainees who are in protective \ncustody for their own safety. \n                                                        \n16   Rules of the City of New York tit. 40 ยงยง 1-16(d)(1) to (4). \n17   Id. ยง 1-16(c)(1)(ii). \n18   What is Enhanced Supervision Housing?, N.Y.C.

On information and belief, the North Infirmary Command facility at \nRikers also includes a highly secure unit designed to house difficult detainees under restrictive \nconditions. \nII.  The Substitute Jail Order Process \n \n52.  New York State law allows for the transfer of pretrial detainees between \nfacilities in different counties through a procedure known as a โsubstitute jail orderโ (โSJOโ).  \nSJOs are issued by the New York State Commission of Correction (โSCOCโ), a state body.19 \n53.  SCOC can only issue an SJO under certain specified conditions.  All \ninvolve imminent threats to safety and basic needs, like a natural disaster that makes a jail unfit \nto hold detainees, or an inability to provide โvital servicesโ like food or medical care at a jail.  \nMost relevant here, SCOC can issue an SJO โwhen the safety or security of a [detainee] or group \nof [detainees] is threatened by their confinement in a facility and the facility administrator \nreasonably believes that the public interest, as well as the safety of the [detainees], would be \nbetter served by their being housed in another . . . facility.โ20 \n54.  State regulations create a mandatory procedure to get an SJO.  The \nadministrator of the original jailโwhich, for New York City jails, is Defendant Commissioner \nBrannโis responsible for finding another suitable jail to receive the detainee in question.  He or \nshe must first look for available options within his county.  If none exist, he or she may look to \nsee whether a jail outside the county can accommodate the detainee.  The administrator must \nconsider the proximity of the other jail, the inconvenience to the detaineeโs family and friends, \n                                                        \n19   See generally N.Y. Corr. Law ยง 504. \n20   9 NYCRR ยง 7210.5. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 18 of 103\n \nthe impact on his access to legal counsel, and the ability of the receiving jail to keep the detainee \nsafe.21 \n55.  The administrator of the original facility is responsible for finding a \nreceiving jail, providing the relevant information to SCOC, and getting the substitute jail order \nfrom SCOC.  The original facility must make the logistical arrangements for the transfer.22  The \noriginal jurisdiction pays the receiving jurisdictionโs expenses of holding the detainees. \n56.  The regulations also allow for an urgent transfer from jail to jail under \nโextraordinary circumstancesโ in which โthe safety or security of a [detainee] cannot be \nmaintained.โ  Under those circumstances, the administrator of the original facility may make a \nwritten request to the New York State Commissioner of Corrections (the โState Commissionerโ) \nto make another facility available to hold the detainee.  The State Commissioner must respond \nwith a written determination that another facility is available to hold the detainee.23  The detainee \nis transferred not to the custody of the receiving facility, but to the custody of the State \nCommissioner, who must house the detainee in the โmost proximate facility.โ  \n57.  Irrespective of the procedure by which a detainee is transferred, notice to \nthe detainee is always required.  The administrator of the receiving jail โshall provide [the \ndetainee] immediately with a written notification of the reasons for his transfer.โ24  The \ntransferred detainee โshall be entitled to all the rights and privileges available to other [detainees] \nof the receiving facility.โ25 \n                                                        \n21   Id. ยง 7210.6. \n22   Id. \n23   Id. ยง 7210.6(e). \n24   Id. ยง 7210.8 (emphasis added). \n25   Id. ยง 7210.9.  In 2017 a bill was introduced in the New York City Council to amend the New York City \nAdministrative Code to provide City detainees with additional notice before they could be transferred out of the City \nby SJO.  The bill would requireโexcept in emergency circumstancesโthat, before any transfer, the detainee and his \ncriminal defense lawyer be given notice and the detainee be given a chance to make three personal phone calls at no \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 19 of 103\n \n58.  SJOs are a lucrative business for upstate county jails with excess capacity.  \nIn 2013, housing other countiesโ detainees on SJOs brought Albany County more than $3 million \nin revenue.  Sheriff Apple explained: โWe have the space.  Weโre trying to run our jail as a \nbusiness . . . .โ26 \nIII.  New York Cityโs Policy and Custom of Rendering Difficult Detainees Upstate to \nPunish Them By, Among Other Things, Putting Them in Solitary Confinement \n59.  The City continues to fall chronically short in preventing DOC officers \nfrom using unnecessary force against detainees.  Earlier this year, the independent monitor \nevaluating the Cityโs compliance with the Nunez consent judgment found: โ[DOC] has not yet \nmade significant progress toward the primary goal of reducing the use of unnecessary and \nexcessive force.  The use of force has continued to increase rather than diminish, even as the \ninmate population has decreased.โ27  \n60.  Over the past few years, the City has dramatically increased its use of \nSJOs to send upstate young detainees whom it deems undesirable.  It has done so to circumvent \nits own ban on solitary confinement for detainees 21 and younger.  And it has done so even \nthough ESH and other facilities are available within New York City as secure units for detainees \nwho require that level of segregation. \n61.  A New York Times investigation published on July 22, 2018, found that \nโ[t]ransfers of inmates 21 and younger increased sharply starting in 2015, the year the city \n                                                        \ncost.

On information and belief, the City has sent dozens of detainees 21 and \nyounger to be held upstate since October 2015.  Between March 8, 2018 and August 15, 2018 \nalone, 21 SJOs were issued transferring detainees from the City to the Albany County Jail. \n63.  It is official City policy that solitary confinement โrepresents a serious \nthreat to the physical and psychological health of adolescents.โ29  And, because DOC has \nstopped requesting variances from the ban on solitary confinement for detainees aged 18-21, it \nhas been established as a matter of City law that DOC has โsufficient resourcesโ to implement \nโnecessary alternative programmingโ to maintain order without using solitary.30 \n64.  Nonetheless, the City continues to send detainees under 22 upstate on \nSJOs, expectingโindeed, knowingโthat they will be put in solitary confinement to punish \nthem. \n65.  In response to public scrutiny over the New York Times investigation, \nMayor de Blasio endorsed and ratified the Cityโs practice.  โOccasionally we have to remove a \nprisoner from our correction system because there is an immediate threat to them and something \nthat requires them being moved to another jurisdiction,โ the Mayor said on July 23, 2018. \n66.  Many of the young detainees transferred from Rikers on SJOs (โRikers \ndetaineesโ or โNew York City detaineesโ) have been charged with assaulting correction officers \non Rikers Island.  To the extent that these detainees face a โthreatโ at Rikers, to use the Mayorโs \n                                                        \n28   Ashley Southall & Jan Ransom, New York Cityโs Young Inmates Are Held in Isolation Upstate, Despite \nBan. N.Y. Times, July 22, 2018, https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/22/nyregion/inmate-solitary-young-nyc.html. \n29   Rules of the City of New York tit. 40, ยง 1-17(a). \n30   Id. ยง 1-17(b)(1)(ii). \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 21 of 103\n \nwords, that threat comes from retaliation by DOC staffโthe very staff hired by the City to \nmaintain order in its jails.  The Cityโs admission that it cannot keep detainees safe from unlawful \nviolence by its own officers is disturbing. \n67.  Rikers detainees are generally not told in advance that they are being sent \nout of New York City on an SJO.  They are simply told one morning by DOC correction officers \nto gather their personal effects.  They are strip-searched and shackled and loaded into a van.  \nBecause this is the same thing that happens when a detainee is moved from jail to jail on Rikers \nIsland, most assume that they are simply being transferred to another facility on Rikers.  \nSometimes DOC correction officers even tell the detainees they will be coming right back.  The \ndetainees are not permitted to call anyone before they leave.  \n68.   Correction officers from DOCโs Emergency Services Unit, or โESU,โ are \ngenerally responsible for transferring detainees.  Once detainees are loaded into the van, the van \nkeeps driving.  It has no windows, so detainees cannot see where they are going.  For many of \nthe young detainees who are sent out of New York City on an SJO, the van finally stops in \nAlbany County. \n69.  The Albany County Jail is about a three-hour drive from New York City, \n160 miles from Rikers Island.  Being held at the Albany County Jail makes it more difficult for \ndetainees to communicate with their lawyers about their pending criminal cases.  It also cuts \ndetainees off from their friends and families, many of whom are indigent and do not have the \nmoney or time off work to take long trips to Albany to visit during narrow visiting hours that are \nfrequently early in the morning. \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 22 of 103\n \n70.  Albany County charges the City $175 a day for each City detainee it \nhouses at the Albany County Jail.31 \nIV.  Albany Countyโs Policy and Custom of Torturing Rikers Detainees  \n \n71.  New York City detainees from Rikers Island brought to Albany on SJOs \nare generally subject to the same routine of torture on arrival, with some variations, after which \nthey are almost uniformly put in solitary confinement. \n72.  When the van doors open, a group of approximately ten Albany County \ncorrection officers are there waiting.  They are wearing green paramilitary uniforms with riot \ngear, helmets, and visors.  This group of officers is called the โGreen Team.โ  Some of the Green \nTeam members have the iconic skull logo of the Punisherโa comic-book antihero who exacts \nviolent revenge on those who have wronged himโon the chest of their body armor.32 \n73.  The Green Team is usually under the command of Lieutenant Anthony \nTorrisi. \n74.  Each New York City detainee is removed from the van one-by-one and \nescorted inside the jail by both the Albany County Jail Green Team officers and DOC ESU \nofficers.  The continued involvement of ESU officers is necessary because the detainee is still \nwearing DOC restraints that need to be returned to Rikers, to which ESU has the keys. \n75.  Each New York City detainee is escorted to the intake area inside the \nAlbany County Jail.  The ESU officers unshackle him and literally hand him over to the Green \n                                                        \n31   Southall & Ransom, supra note 28. \n32   Whichever officers suit up in green fatigues and riot gear on a given day comprise the โGreen Team.โ  It is \nnot a separate unit with a fixed membership. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 23 of 103\n \nTeam, who then put him in Albany handcuffs.  The detainee is put in a booking cell with several \nGreen Team officers, where Torrisi begins commanding a choreographed routine of torture. \n76.  โThis isnโt Rikers,โ Torrisi routinely tells the detainee.  โWe do what we \nwant here.โ  The detainee is given a series of arbitrary and increasingly convoluted commands, \nin the nature of: โFace the wall with your right foot behind your left and your right hand higher \nthan your left,โ or โTake off your jumper with your right hand and pass it back to us over your \nleft shoulder.โ \n77.  If the detainee gets confused, as he invariably will, he gets punched. \n78.  Torrisi then tells the detainee, in sum and substance: โWeโre going to take \nthese cuffs off you.  When the cuffs come off, you start swinging.โ  The detaineeโs cuffs are \nremoved, and he is then tackled to the floor and beaten until Torrisi orders the Green Team to \nstop. \n79.  The DOC ESU officers who brought the New York City detainees to \nAlbany are, on information and belief, often present inside the intake area of the Albany County \nJail when these things happen.  On information and belief, they can see and hear what is \nhappening and are able to intervene to stop it if they so choose, but they choose not to. \n80.  After intake, each Rikers detainee is taken to the โBOSS Chair,โ a body \nscanner designed to detect contraband stored in body cavities.  The detainee then goes through a \nmetal detector and is brought to a medical x-ray room to be x-rayed for contraband. \n81.  The Rikers detainee is then taken upstairs to the solitary confinement cell \nblock known as โ4 Eastโ and put in a cell which, on information and belief, has already been \nassigned to them. \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 24 of 103\n \n82.  At some point during this processโoften after the x-ray, but sometimes \nduring an initial strip search in the intake penโTorrisi claims to have seen contraband, whether \nreal or imagined, inside the Rikers detaineeโs rectum. \n83.  Jails have legitimate security needs and must prevent detainees from \nbringing contraband or weapons inside.  If a search identifies contraband in a detaineeโs body, \nthe appropriate responses may include placing the detainee in isolation and waiting until the \ndetainee expels the contraband or seeking the assistance of a medical professional to remove the \nitem with the detaineeโs consent. \n84.  It is unreasonable, unsafe, and inconsistent with standard correctional \npractice for a guard who has no medical training to attempt to forcibly remove contraband from a \ndetaineeโs rectum without his consent in a nonmedical environment. \n85.  For example, DOCCS, which runs all New York State prisons, allows \nmanual searches of body cavities other than the rectum to be conducted only by medical \npersonnel with the approval of the Deputy Commissioner or Chief Medical Officer of DOCCS, \nin an examination room with appropriate medical equipment using appropriate medical \ntechniques.33 \n86.  DOCCS guidelines provide that โrectal cavity searches will not be \nauthorizedโ under any circumstances.34 \n87.  DOCโs own policies and procedures forbid any manual cavity searches by \nuniformed correctional staff.  DOC staff may not engage in โany probing or touching of the \ngenital or anal cavitiesโ when strip-searching detainees.  Rather, if DOC staff suspect the \n                                                        \n33   See N.Y. State Depโt of Corr. & Cmty.

But the Green Team is not even engaged in a legitimate effort to conduct \nmanual body cavity searches at all.  Rather, it assaults and sexually assaults Rikers detainees \nunder the pretext of attempting to forcibly remove real or imagined contraband from their \nrectums, but with the real purpose of terrifying and intimidating the Rikers detainees. \n89.  Green Team officers sometimes use Tasers against cuffed Rikers \ndetainees; insert their fingers into detaineesโ rectums; and even sodomize detainees with foreign \nobjects.  These actions have no legitimate security purpose.  Rather, they are assaults designed to \nassert the dominance of correctional staff and humiliate, intimidate, and degrade detainees. \n90.  After undergoing this violent ritual on arrival at the Albany County Jail, \nRikers detainees often have visible injuries.  Invariably, Defendant Nurse Mylroie, widely \nknown as โMissy,โ is the assigned medical provider.  She refuses to give the detainees medical \ncare, unhelpfully telling them that they are fine as long as they can walk and talk, and instructs \nthem to take Motrin. \n91.  After being beaten, Rikers detainees are written up for โassaulting staff,โ \namong other infractions.  The written tickets generally say that the detainee โturned off the wallโ \nor โturned aroundโ to assault staff. \n92.  That any of the Rikers detainees chose to spontaneously assault multiple \nofficers wearing helmets and full riot gear while locked in a confined space is entirely unlikely.  \nThat all of them did so rises to the level of systematic fabrication. \n                                                        \n35   See N.Y.C. Depโt of Corr. Directive No. 4508R-E, ยง V.G.1 & app. B, May 15, 2009.  \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 26 of 103\n \n93.  After they are assaulted upon arrival at the Albany County Jail, Rikers \ndetainees are given a disciplinary hearing at which they are told it does not matter what they say \nbecause they will be found guilty regardless. \n94.  No testimony is taken at the hearings, and the hearings are not recorded or \ntranscribed in any way.  The detainees are found guilty of infractions at the hearing and \nsentenced to long periods of solitary confinement, often for well more than a year. \n95.  Several Rikers detainees have observed a โwheelโ with a spinning arrow \non the table in the hearing room.  The wheel resembles the crude device that comes with board \ngames like Twister.  The detainees do not know the wheelโs purpose, but some have seen hearing \nofficers spin the wheel during the hearing, and they suspect that the officers may be using the \nwheel to assign punishments arbitrarily. \nV.  Albany Countyโs Policy and Custom of Putting All Rikers Detainees in Solitary \nConfinement \n \n96.  The Rikers detainees spend their remaining time at the Albany County Jail \nin solitary confinement.  They are in their cells by themselves for a minimum of 23 hours a day, \nwith no meaningful social interaction, environmental stimulation, or human contact.  They are \noffered one hour of โrecreationโ by themselves in an indoor cage and a 15-minute shower every \nother day.  Most decline the โrecreationโ time in the cage because the cage is functionally \nindistinguishable from their cells. \n97.  The Albany County Jailโs solitary confinement unit, known as โ4 East,โ \nconsists of approximately 20 cells arrayed on multiple tiers.  A typical cell is about 6 feet by 8 \nfeet. \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 27 of 103\n \n98.  Sheriff Apple told the New York Times that it was the Albany County \nJailโs policy to put any detainee who has ever assaulted correctional staff, regardless of where or \nwhen, in solitary confinement.36 \n99.  On information and belief, every single New York City detainee who has \nbeen brought to the Albany County Jail on an SJO in the past two years has been beaten and put \nin solitary confinement.  Plaintiffs are unaware of any New York City detainee who was \nintegrated into the general population at the Albany County Jail. \n100.  On information and belief, the vast majority of the detainees housed in 4 \nEast at the Albany County Jail over the past two years have been from New York City. \n101.  In response to a grievance about conditions on 4 East submitted by \nPlaintiff Doe in June 2018, Major Brian Mooney, the Albany County Jailโs chief administrative \nofficer for grievances, wrote: โDue to the violent and assaultive behavior displayed by the \ninmates housed from Rikers Island, the facility has adopted new protocols to ensure the safety of \nall staff that come into contact with them.โ \nVI.  New York City Has Received Repeated Notice of Albanyโs Torture and Abuse of \nDOC Inmates, and Continues to Transfer Detainees There to Be Tortured  \n \n102.  The City and its policymakers are aware of the increased rate of transfers \nof Rikers detainees to the Albany County Jail after the City banned solitary confinement for \ndetainees 21 and younger.   \n103.  The City and its policymakers are aware that detainees routinely fail to \nreceive notice or an opportunity to be heard before being transferred outside the City on an SJO.  \n                                                        \n36   Southall & Ransom, supra note 28. \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 28 of 103\n \nAnd they are aware that Rikers detainees have repeatedly alleged that guards at the Albany \nCounty Jail have beaten them.  \n104.  The City has failed to investigate or remediate these conditions and has \ncontinued sending detainees, including many aged 21 and younger, to the Albany County Jail \nwithout notice, to be beaten and put in solitary confinement. \n105.  In August 2017, four New York City Council Members introduced a bill \nto amend City law to require that Rikers detainees be provided with notice before being \ntransferred outside the City on an SJO.  That bill is being considered by the relevant Council \ncommittee.37 \n106.  On February 16, 2018, criminal defense counsel for a Rikers detainee who \nhad been transferred to Albany with Mr. Espinal wrote to DOCโs general counsel to inform DOC \nthat his client had been subjected to โmultiple beatingsโ and โmistreatmentโ at the Albany \nCounty Jail.  The letter expressed concern for the detaineeโs safety and requested his transfer out \nof Albany to a โsafer environment.โ \n107.  On March 3, 2018, Plaintiff Espinal filed a notice of claim with the \nComptroller of the City of New York.  In that notice, Plaintiff Espinal explained that, upon his \narrival in the Albany County Jail, he had been brutally assaulted, tased, and held in a restraint \nchair for an extended period of time. \n108.  On April 12, 2018, a Rikers detainee named Julian Cepeda filed an Article \n78 petition against DOC and Commissioner Brann, among others, challenging his transfer to the \nAlbany County Jail as a matter of state law.  In his petition, Mr. Cepeda alleged, among other \n                                                        \n37   A Local Law to Amend the Administrative Code of the City of New York, in Relation to Requiring Notice \nand Review for Transferring Inmates to Facilities Outside New York City, supra note 25. \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 29 of 103\n \nthings, that on the day of his arrival at the Albany County Jail, he was โbrutally beaten and \nsexually assaulted, where an officer put on a latex glove and stuck his finger in Petitioner[โs] \nbuttocks.โ  Mr. Cepeda further alleged that he โmade [a] medical complaint about rectal bleeding \nand visible swollen area to medical staffโ but was denied medical attention. \n109.  On July 10, 2018, Plaintiff Espinalโs criminal defense counsel, Ruben \nFernandez of The Bronx Defenders, notified DOC Commissioner Brann and numerous other \nofficials in writing about the abuses and conditions that Mr. Espinal had been subjected to at \nAlbany County Jail.  The DOC general counselโs office responded by denying responsibility for \nMr. Espinalโs treatment while he is held at the Albany County Jail. \n110.  On July 22, 2018, the New York Times published its lengthy story on the \ntreatment of Rikers detainees at the Albany County Jail.  The Times explained that detainees \nwere transferred out of New York City without notice and put in solitary confinement at the \nAlbany County Jail.  The Times reported on several detaineesโ allegations that they had been \nbeaten on arrival at the Albany County Jail.38  In response, Mayor de Blasio defended the Cityโs \npractice of sending young detainees to Albany to be put in solitary confinement. \n111.  On October 31, 2018, Mr. Cepeda, represented by attorney Robert \nQuackenbush of the Legal Aid Society Prisonersโ Rights Project, filed an amended Article 78 \npetition again alleging that he had been assaulted without provocation during the admission \nprocess at the Albany County Jail.  Mr. Cepeda further alleged that he was 20 years old and \nwould be held in solitary confinement in Albany until May 11, 2019. \n112.  On November 19, 2018, the City opposed Mr. Cepedaโs petition and filed \nan affidavit sworn to by Defendant Williams.  In his affidavit, Defendant Williams explained that \n                                                        \n38   Southall & Ransom, supra note 28. \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 30 of 103\n \nAlbany County has shown a unique willingness to accept City inmates with โviolent infraction \nhistories.โ  Defendant Williams testified that โonlyโ the Albany County Jail, and โno otherโ \nfacility closer to New York City, would agree to house Mr. Cepeda or was โequippedโ to house \nMr. Cepeda. \n113.  On December 3, 2018, Plaintiff Tillery, represented by attorney \nQuackenbush, filed a similar Article 78 petition against DOC and Commissioner Brann \nchallenging his transfer to the Albany County Jail as a matter of state law.  He alleged, among \nother things, that he had been subject to excessive and unlawful force during the intake process \nat the Albany County Jail. \nVII.  Albany Countyโs Systemic Interference with Communications with Counsel \n \n114.  Because the Albany County Jail is 160 miles from New York City, it is \nnot feasible for Rikers detaineesโ criminal defense lawyers to pay regular visits to discuss the \ndetaineesโ pending criminal cases in New York City courts. \n115.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate by reference the Declaration of Ruben \nFernandez, to be filed with the Court on the date of this Amended Complaint, which explains \nwhy it is effectively impossible for appointed criminal defense attorneys in New York City to \neffectively counsel their clients in Albany about serious pending charges. \n116.  At a bare minimum, it is critical that Rikers detainees and their criminal \ndefense attorneys be permitted to hold confidential telephone calls.  Such consultation is \nnecessary for the Rikers detainees to participate in and direct their defense of the criminal \ncharges against them. \n117.  State law governing county jails requires that โall prisoners shall have \naccess to legal counsel,โ including โtelephone communications.โ  It further provides that \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 31 of 103\n \nโtelephone communications between prisoners and their legal counsel shall not be monitored \nexcept visually.โ39 \n118.  However, there is no such thing as a confidential, unrecorded legal \ntelephone call to or from the Albany County Jail. \n119.  Detainees in solitary confinement at the Albany County Jail are generally \nnot permitted to use the telephone at all. \n120.  The Albany County Jail will arrange for detainees in solitary confinement \nto speak with their attorneys under exigent circumstances.  But those calls are monitored by jail \nstaff. \n121.  Albany County Jail officials have repeatedly represented, including to the \nLegal Aid Society Prisonersโ Rights Project, that all detainee calls to or from the Albany County \nJailโeven with counselโare monitored. \n122.  In a letter dated August 6, 2018, Chief Deputy Sheriff William Rice stated \nthat Albany County has โno policies or directive[s] addressing confidential telephone \ncommunications between incarcerated persons [and] counsel.โ \n123.  Albany County Jail correction officers have made comments to Plaintiffs \nEspinal and Tillery about the details of Espinal and Tilleryโs private conversations with their \nattorneys.  Plaintiffs Espinal and Tillery did not voluntarily disclose those details to their jailors.  \nThe only way the correction officers could have learned those details was by listening to the \nconversations without Plaintiffs Espinal and Tilleryโs consent.  \n                                                        \n39   9 NYCRR ยงยง 7031.2(a), (b). \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 32 of 103\n \nVIII.  The Experiences of the Named Plaintiffs \n \n124.  Plaintiffsโ experiences are emblematic of the punitive and arbitrary nature \nof SJO transfers off Rikers Island and the routinized torture, sexual assault, deliberate \nindifference to serious medical needs, and unlawful solitary confinement that New York City \ndetainees experience in Albany County. \nDavon Washington \nA.  Davon Washington is Detained at Rikers Island Starting in March 2016 \n \n125.  Davon Washington is a 22-year-old African American young man. \n126.  Davon was diagnosed as a child with depression.  He spent time in his \nchildhood in a group home and in foster care.   \n127.  At the age of 19, Davon was arrested and taken into custody by the New \nYork City DOC. \n128.  Davon arrived at Rikers Island on or around March 24, 2016. \n129.  While at Rikers Island, Davon received mental health services, including \ncounseling and medication for attention deficit disorder.  He also received educational services in \nsupport of his efforts to obtain a GED, and he attended high school at the Island Academy. \nB.  The March 28, 2018 Transfer of Davon Washington from Rikers to the  \nAlbany County Jail \n \n130.  While at Rikers Island, in or about March 2018, Davon lodged complaints \nwith the Legal Aid Society Prisonersโ Rights Project, alleging, among other things, that he was \ngroped by a DOC staff member and denied adequate mental health and medical care. \n131.  On information and belief, Legal Aid representatives contacted DOC \nabout Davonโs complaints on or about March 16, 2018 and March 26, 2018. \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 33 of 103\n \n132.  On or about March 22, 2018, DOC ESU officers woke Davon up in the \nearly morning and ordered him to โpack up.โ  Davon complied, and he was removed from his \ncell for the day.  However, he was returned the same cell at the end of the day. \n133.  On March 28, 2018, ESU officers woke Davon up in the early morning \nand again ordered him to pack up. \n134.  The ESU officers told Davon, in apparent reference to a deputy warden at \nthe jail where Davon was housed, that Deputy Walker โcanโt be around you.โ \n135.  The ESU officers strip-searched Devon, placed him in the BOSS Chair, \nand put him through a metal detector. \n136.  When Davon asked where he was going, ESU responded, โOff Rikers.โ  \nESU told him, in an apparent reference to Defendant Walker: โYouโre going to Albany because \nDeputy Walker donโt want you.โ \n137.  ESU placed Davon in a transport van with one other detainee. \n138.  Prior to being removed from Rikers, Davon was given no written \nnotification for the basis of the transfer, received no hearing, and was not permitted to call his \nfamily or lawyers to inform anyone of his whereabouts.  He was not even told he was going to be \ntransferred. \n139.  Defendant Williams obtained the SJO transferring Davon to Albany \nCounty. \n140.  The Substitute Jail Order issued by the SCOC is dated March 22, 2018.  It \nstates that DOC, โas a result of safety considerations,โ is โunfit for the confinement of Devon \n[sic] Washington.โ \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 34 of 103\n \n141.  ESU officers drove Davon and the other detainee in the van for several \nhours.   \n142.  When Davon exited the van, he saw a squad of approximately 12 law \nenforcement officers standing in front of him, wearing green fatigues and riot gear, including \nhelmets and body armor.  Davon would later learn that these were correction officers from the \nAlbany County Jail.   \n143.  Several green-suited officers grabbed Davon and took him to the Intake \narea of the Albany County Jail.  Approximately two to three ESU officers also entered the \nAlbany County Jail escorting Davon. \n144.  The ESU officers removed Davonโs Rikers cuffs and restraints, and he \nwas placed in Albany County Jail cuffs and shackles. \n145.  Davon followed all orders given to him and was cooperative during this \nprocedure. \nC.  Defendants Physically and Sexually Assault Davon Washington at the \nAlbany County Jail   \n \n146.  Several Albany County Jail correction officers then moved Davon into a \nsmall room, Booking Cell #2. \n147.  Approximately eight to ten Albany County Jail correction officers and \nsupervisors, including Defendants Torrisi, Valvo, Lawson, Haley, LaBombard, and Anzalone \nwere waiting for him in the room. \n148.  Defendant Torrisi told Davon to put his head on the wall.  Davon \ncomplied.   \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 35 of 103\n \n149.  Defendant Torrisi asked Davon, in sum and substance: โWhat are you \ndoing here?โ  When Davon stated โI donโt know,โ Defendant Torrisi smacked Davon in the face \nwith his open hand. \n150.  Defendant Torrisi then stated, โWhoโs the biggest gang?โ, in an apparent \nreference to alleged gang affiliation, and again smacked Davon in the face several times with an \nopen hand. \n151.  Defendant Torrisi stated to Davon, in sum and substance: โWeโre going to \ngive you instructions, follow them correctly.  Once we take these cuffs off, you better start \nswinging.โ \n152.  Defendants then removed Davonโs handcuffs and began to punch Davon \nall over his body. \n153.  On information and belief, the ESU officers were still in the intake area of \nthe Albany County Jail and were aware of what was happening. \n154.  Davon fell to the ground and curled up in the fetal position. \n155.  Defendants either kicked and stomped on Davon or simply stood by and \ndid nothing to intervene while Davon lay on the ground and was beaten. \n156.  Defendant Torrisi stated: โWake him up.  I want him to feel everything.  \nHe likes to assault officers.โ \n157.  Four defendants then lifted Davon up and placed him face-first against the \nwall.  They then instructed Davon to take his left shoe off with his right hand and pass it over his \nright shoulder.  They then continued to give him other instructions to undress in a specific way.   \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 36 of 103\n \n158.  Davon was nervous and found it hard to comply with the instructions \nregarding his right and left hands.  Every time he made a mistake, such as by using his left hand \ninstead of his right hand, one of the Defendants would punch him. \n159.  When Davon was naked, Defendants asked: โWeโre gonna ask you once: \ndo you have anything you are not supposed to have?โ \n160.  Anticipating that he might go through a metal detector, Davon told \nDefendants that he had a bullet fragment in his foot.  In response, Defendants stomped directly \non Davonโs foot, causing him extreme pain. \n161.  Defendants then instructed Davon to spread his buttocks and cough. \nDavon complied.  \n162.  Defendants stated, โI see plastic,โ referring to an alleged item of \ncontraband in Davonโs rectum, and continued to beat Davon while he was naked. \n163.  Defendants then pushed Davon to the floor.  One of the Defendants \nforcefully inserted two fingers into Davonโs rectum.  Defendants then stated, in reference to the \nsupposed contraband: โHe pushed it back up.โ \n164.  Defendants removed Davon from the cell, placed him in the BOSS chair, \nand put him through the metal detector to search for contraband.  Davon complied with all \ninstructions.  There was no indication that he was in possession of any contraband. \n165.  Davon was bleeding from his nose and mouth.  Defendants shouted at him \nto stop bleeding onto the BOSS chair. \n166.  Defendants ordered Davon to submit to a medical x-ray to search for \ncontraband.  Davon complied.   \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 37 of 103\n \n167.  Defendant Mylroie asked Davon if he had any injuries and he responded \nthat he did.  Defendants Lawson and Valvo, who were standing nearby, then punched Davon in \nthe face, stating โAsk him again, any injuries?โ  Davon then stated โNo.โ \n168.  Defendants escorted Davon to Cell #19 in the SHU located in 4 East \nHousing Unit. \n169.  Defendants ordered Davon to undress until he was naked.  Davon \ncomplied.  \n170.  Defendants Torrisi, Lawson, and a correction officer with spiky hair \npunched and kicked Davon multiple times while he was handcuffed and shackled in Cell #19. \n171.  Defendant Mylroie came to his cell at one point and asked if he wanted \nmedical attention.  Davon had blood all over his face and was visibly injured.  Davon was scared \nand told her that he didnโt need medical attention. \n172.  Later in the day, Major Brian Mooney came to Davonโs cell and stated to \nhim, in sum and substance: โDonโt mess around.  This is not Rikers.โ  \n173.  As a result of the beating, Davon was bleeding, his face was swollen, his \ntooth was chipped, his lip was split, his foot was hurting, and he was bruised all over his back \nand body.  He was in pain for many days after the assault. \n174.  The Albany County Jail reports concerning the assault against Davon \nfalsely claim that he turned around and attacked staff members inside the booking cell: \nAt 1:17 p.m. Team 1 removed Inmate Washington from the Rikers \ntransport.  Inmate was brought into booking for processing.  Inmate \nwas escorted to Booking 2 Cell and read into SHU.  When officer \nremoved the handcuffs from inmate, inmate turned around and \nstarted punching at officers.  Inmate was brought to the floor and \nrestrained with body holds.  Inmate was placed back on the wall and \nthe strip search was completed. \n \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 38 of 103\n \n175.  Davon received an infraction ticket for the incident on or about March 28, \n2018, which falsely accused him of โlungingโ at staff and attempting to punch them when his \nhandcuffs were removed. \n176.  Davon appeared at the disciplinary hearing on April 8, 2018. \n177.  Davon did not testify at the hearing because he feared further retaliation \nand violence.  According to the facility Inmate Disciplinary Report, his only statement at the \nhearing was that he had nothing to say about the incident. \n178.  At the end of a hearing, Davon was sentenced to 360 days of punitive \nsegregationโan extraordinarily long periodโ by the hearing officer, Defendant Grimes. \n179.  Since the assault, Davon has continued to experience pain, emotional \ndistress, and traumatic thoughts. \nD.  Davon Washington Is Held in Solitary Confinement at the Albany County \nJail For Nine Months \n \n180.  From his arrival at the Albany County Jail on March 28, 2018 until his \ndeparture in or around December 2018, with the exception of court visits, Davon was kept in a \nsmall solitary cell for at least 23 hours a day. \n181.  Davon had nothing to do in his cell: no meaningful human interaction, no \neducation or programming, no music or television, and limited reading materials. He had limited \naccess to phone calls, was not permitted to talk to other detainees, and did not leave his cell \nexcept to shower three times a week. \n182.     Davon was permitted to spend one hour a day out of his cell in a metal \ncage placed in the hallway outside his cell.  The metal cage is placed next to a window.  It is an \nempty, chain-link cage with nothing in it. \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 39 of 103\n \n183.  Davon was issued a number of disciplinary infractions for talking and \nโyelling,โ when he attempted to speak with the other detainees housed in the SHU.  One of these \ntickets resulted in him losing his commissary and phone privileges for 60 days. \n184.  If the young detainees in 4 East try to speak with each other, the SHU \nofficers turn on two large fans that make it both loud and extremely cold in the unit. \n185.  Defendants denied Davon access to educational programming and \nmaterials.  Davon filed grievances about this educational denial. \n186.  Davon was placed on psychiatric medication at Albany, including a \nmedicine he had not previously required. \n187.  Davon also lost a substantial amount of weightโapproximately 18 \npoundsโwhile at the Albany County Jail.  When he arrived, he weighed 155 pounds, and as of \nOctober 5, 2018, he was down to 137 pounds.  The food portions were small and Davon was \nconstantly hungry, particularly at night.  He was placed on Ensure and vitamins in an attempt to \ncounteract the weight loss from inadequate nutrition. \n188.  While at the Albany County Jail, Davon had no visits from his family \nbecause it was too far for them to travel.  However, at Rikers, his mother, sisters, brother, and \nother family members were able to visit him. \nE.  Albany County Jail Guards Beat Davon Washington in Retaliation for a \nLegal Visit on October 5, 2018 \n \n189.  On October 5, 2018, Davon had a legal visit in the Albany County Jail \nwith his counsel in this action. \n190.  When the legal visit ended, multiple correction officers escorted Davon \nout of the visiting area. \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 40 of 103\n \n191.  One of them was an individual who was also involved in the initial March \n28, 2018 assault on Davon. \n192.  After the visit, the officers did not take Davon to the search area, as is \nstandard protocol. \n193.  Instead, three officers took Davon directly back to his cell and pushed him \ninto the back corner of the cell.  There are no cameras inside the cell. \n194.  One of the officers then struck Davon in the face repeatedly on his face \nwith an open hand, switching between striking the left and right sides of his face. \n195.  He then stated, in sum and substance, referring to Davonโs legal visit: \nโWhat did you think, that was going to stop us?โ and โWhat youโre doing is not going to work.โ \n196.  The officers took Davonโs legal paperwork from him.  \nSteven Espinal \nA.  Steven Espinal Is Detained at Rikers Island Starting on November 18, 2017 \n \n197.  Steven Espinal is a 19-year-old Latino teenager detained at the Albany \nCounty Jail, where he is currently in solitary confinement.   \n198.  Although he has criminal matters pending in the Bronx County Supreme \nCourt, Steven has no adult criminal convictions. \n199.  Steven was diagnosed as a teenager with bipolar disorder and attention-\ndeficit/hyperactivity disorder. \n200.  At the age of 18, Steven was arrested and put in the custody of the New \nYork City DOC. \n201.  He arrived at Rikers Island on November 18, 2017. \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 41 of 103\n \n202.  While at Rikers, Steven worked and received mental health services, \nincluding counseling, and educational services in support of his efforts to obtain a GED. \n203.  On February 10, 2018, Steven was detained at the George Motchan \nDetention Center (โGMDCโ). \n204.  On this date, he and other detainees, all of whom were under 21 at the \ntime, were allegedly involved in an altercation with a correction officer. \n205.  The correction officer was reported to have suffered a fracture to his spine. \n206.  The February 10, 2018 incident received widespread media coverage.  \nRepresentatives of the Correction Officers Benevolent Association (โCOBAโ) made public \nstatement blaming the incident on Mayor de Blasioโs policy of shielding detainees under 21 from \nsolitary confinement.  COBA blamed the inability to isolate detainees under 21 for an increase in \nattacks on correction officers. \n207.  On February 10, 2018, DOC ESU officers brought Steven in a van from \nGMDC to a different building on Rikers Island to be fingerprinted and rearrested.  There, the \nESU officers hit Stevenโs head on a wall and smacked him in the face. \n208.  On February 11, 2018, Steven was transferred from GMDC to the Otis \nBantum Correctional Center (โOBCCโ), a different facility on Rikers. \n209.  On February 12, 2018, Steven was arraigned in Bronx Criminal Court and \ncharged with first-degree assault and other related counts stemming from the alleged February 10 \nincident. \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 42 of 103\n \nB.  The February 13, 2018 Transfer of Steven Espinal from Rikers to the Albany \nCounty Jail \n \n210.  On February 13, 2018, a captain woke Steven up in the early morning and \ntold him to get dressed because ESU was coming for him.  Steven asked where he was going.  \nThe captain said he would be coming right back. \n211.  ESU officers came for Steven and another young man who was allegedly \ninvolved in the February 10 incident and put them in a transport van. \n212.  After Steven was secured in the van, ESU officers drove to another \nlocation to pick up two more Rikers detainees who were also allegedly involved in the February \n10 incident. \n213.  Before being removed from Rikers, Steven was given no written \nnotification of the basis of his transfer, received no hearing, and was not permitted to call his \nfamily or lawyers to inform anyone of his whereabouts.  He was not even told that he was going \nto be transferred. \n214.  ESU officers drove Steven and the other three detainees in the van for \nseveral hours.  Steven did not know where he was being taken. \n215.  At approximately 11:00am, the van door was opened. \n216.  Steven saw a squad of approximately 12 law enforcement officers \nstanding in front of him, wearing green fatigues and riot gear, including helmets and body armor.  \nSteven would later learn that these were correction officers from the Albany County Jail. \n217.  One of the green-suited officers said, โWe want Espinal first.โ \n218.  Several green-suited officers grabbed Steven and took him to the intake \narea of the Albany County Jail.  About two to three Rikers ESU officers also entered the Jail \nescorting Steven. \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 43 of 103\n \n219.  The Rikers ESU team removed Stevenโs DOC handcuffs. \n220.  One of the Albany County Jail officers took his photograph. \n221.  Several Albany County Jail officers them re-handcuffed Steven in Albany \nCounty Jail cuffs and shackled him. \n222.  Steven followed all orders given to him and was cooperative throughout \nthis process. \n223.  That same day, Stevenโs criminal defense attorney, Ruben Fernandez, \nattempted to contact Steven at Rikers by videoconference but was told by DOC staff that Steven \nhad been transferred from one Rikers Island facility to another.  Stevenโs attorney was unable to \ncontact Steven and did not know his location. \n224.  DOC has represented in an August 15, 2018 letter to Stevenโs criminal \ndefense counsel that it transferred Steven to the Albany County Jail on an emergency basis due \nto โextraordinary circumstancesโ under 9 NYCRR ยง 7210.6(e). \n225.  However, on information and belief, no written correspondence between \nthe City and the State Commissioner exists, as required by law to authorize such a transfer.40 \n226.  On March 28, 2018โa month and a half after Steven arrived in the \nAlbany County JailโSCOC issued an SJO on the basis that โthe NYC Department of Correction \nis, as a result of safety considerations, unfit for the confinement of STEVEN ESPINA [sic].โ \n227.  Defendant Williams obtained the SJO transferring Steven to Albany \nCounty. \n                                                        \n40   See supra ยถ 56. \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 44 of 103\n \nC.  Defendants Physically and Sexually Assault Steven Espinal at the Albany \nCounty Jail \n \n228.  After Steven was cuffed and shackled, several Albany County Jail \ncorrection officers moved him into Booking Cell #2. \n229.  About eight to ten Albany County Jail correction officers and supervisors \nwere waiting for him there.  Defendants Torrisi, Harris, Beliveau, Adams, Kelly, Jarosz, Lawson, \nand Ton were present. \n230.  Defendant Torrisi stated to Steven, in sum and substance: โThis isnโt \nRikers.  This is Albany County.  We do what we want.โ \n231.  Defendant Torrisi then punched Steven in the face two times. \n232.  Defendant Torrisi then said to Steven, in sum and substance, โOnce we \ntake these cuffs off, you better start swinging.โ \n233.  Defendants began the process of removing Stevenโs handcuffs but did not \nactually remove them.  They began punching Steven all over his body. \n234.  Steven fell to the ground and curled up in the fetal position. \n235.  Defendants kicked and stomped on Steven while he lay on the ground \nand/or stood by and did nothing to intervene. \n236.  Defendant Torrisi then stated to the other officers, โThatโs enough.  Letโs \nget him up, boys.โ \n237.  The officers picked Steven up.  Defendant Torrisi told Steven to face the \nwall and said, in sum and substance, โAs soon as I take the cuffs off, put your hands high up on \nthe wall.โ  Steven complied. \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 45 of 103\n \n238.  Defendants gave Steven a series of confusing instructions about how to \nremove his clothing.  Steven did his best to comply.  When he was unable to do so, Defendants \npunched him in the ribs. \n239.  Once his clothing was removed, Defendants provided Steven with an \nAlbany County Jail jumpsuit, which he put on. \n240.  In total, the assault on Steven in the intake area lasted for several minutes. \n241.  Defendants then brought Steven to the BOSS chair and instructed him to \npass through a metal detector to search for contraband.   \n242.  Defendants then brought Steven to an x-ray room and ordered him to \nsubmit to a medical x-ray to search for contraband.   \n243.  Defendants said that the x-ray had detected that Steven had a weapon in \nhis body. \n244.  Defendants then brought Steven to the 4 East housing unit. \n245.  He was taken to a nurse at the back of the housing unit, who said that he \nwas fine. \n246.  Defendants then escorted Steven to Cell #3 in 4 East. \n247.  Defendants ordered Steven to remove his jumper in the cell and pass it \nback to them.  Steven complied. \n248.  Defendants then punched and kicked Steven multiple times.  An officer \nsaid, in sum and substance, โWeโre going to get that out of you,โ referring to the alleged \ncontraband. \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 46 of 103\n \n249.  When Steven was on the floor, an officer put on gloves.  Defendant \nLawson held Stevenโs arms down.  The gloved officer forcefully inserted his fingers into \nStevenโs rectum. \n250.  The officer who had inserted his fingers into Stevenโs rectum said he \ncould not feel anything.  Other officers said, in sum and substance, โHe knows what heโs doing.  \nHeโs moving it up.โ \n251.  Steven was bleeding from his rectum and in great pain. \n252.  Defendants then told Steven to defecate on the floor and threatened to beat \nthe alleged contraband out of his body if he failed to do so.  Defendants continued to assault \nSteven while he was lying naked on the floor. \n253.  The officers then ordered Steven to stand up. \n254.  One of the officers said, in sum and substance, โWeโre going to make you \nsh*t it out.โ \n255.  While Steven was standing against the wall, Defendant Beliveau used a \ntaser against him.  \n256.  Steven was standing with his back to the officers when he was tased from \na few feet away.  He did not know what was happening.  He felt extreme pain and felt unable to \nmove.  He fell to the ground. \n257.  The assault on Steven in Cell #3 lasted for several minutes in total. \n258.  After the assault, Steven was taken to the shower.  He was then brought to \nthe restraint chair. \n259.  The restraint chair is a physical restraint device that allows correction \nofficers to fasten a detainee to a chair at the wrists, ankles, thighs, arms, and head. \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 47 of 103\n \n260.  While Steven was in the restraint chair, officers slapped and smacked him \nthe face.  They asked him, in sum and substance, โHow does it feel not to be able to defend \nyourself?โ \n261.  Steven was held in the restraint chair overnight.  While in the chair, he \npassed out from pain and fatigue. \n262.  On the morning of February 14, 2018, Steven woke up in the restraint \nchair.  Officers then brought him to the medical area. \n263.  As a result of the beating, Steven was bleeding, was bruised all over his \nbody, and was dizzy and dazed.  He was unable to urinate normally and saw blood in his urine.  \nHe could not hear out of one of his ears. \n264.  On February 14, 2018, Steven was taken to Albany Medical Center, where \nhe was catheterized because he was unable to urinate normally. \n265.  In the intake area on the way to or from the hospital, Steven encountered \nDefendant Superintendent Lyons, who observed Stevenโs physical condition. \n266.  Steven feared retaliation from Defendants if he reported that that Albany \nCounty Jail guards had assaulted him while these guards listened to his report. He told medical \nstaff that he had lost consciousness the day before in a โfight.โ   \n267.  Albany Medical Center staff documented scratches to his face, tenderness \nto his neck, subrapubic tenderness, โmultiple bruises and abrasions on the bilateral upper \nextremities,โ and โmidline C spine tendernessโ requiring a collar and CT scan of the head and \nneck. \n268.  After his return from Albany Medical Center, Steven was sent back to \nsolitary confinement in Cell #3 on 4 East. \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 48 of 103\n \n269.  On February 16, 2018, Steven was transported to the Bronx for another in-\nperson court appearance in the Bronx.  The judge ordered that Steven be given immediate \nmedical attention. \n270.  The Albany County Jail reports about the assault against Steven claim that \nhe repeatedly โturned off the wallโ to assault multiple staff members in riot gear while locked in \na confined space: \n[W]hile conducting a CERT operation in Booking processing new \nRikerโs [sic] Island Inmate Boarders, Inmate Espinal did not comply \nwith staff orders during a strip search by turning off the wall towards \nstaff & threatened to cut them.  He was taken to the floor & \nrestrained by staff until he was brought under control.  After we \ncompleted the Booking process, he was taken to the X-ray room, \nwhere an X-ray was taken & showed positive for two objects in his \nrectum.  He was then taken to SHU . . . .   During his apparent \nattempt to remove the items, while covered in his own feces, after \nbeing given several direct orders to remain facing the wall, inmate \nturned from the wall & lunged at staff.  \n \n \nD.  Steven Espinal Remains in Solitary Confinement at the Albany County Jail, \nAfter Nearly a Year There  \n \n271.  For two weeks, Defendants provided Steven with no notice of the basis for \nhis punitive detention in solitary confinement. \n272.  An infraction ticket dated February 13, 2018 that falsely accused Steven of \nassaulting staff was generated, but not served on Steven. \n273.  A disciplinary hearing was held on February 26, 2018, at which Steven \nappeared. \n274.  Prior to the hearing, a sergeant told Steven that โno matter what \nhappened,โ he would remain in punitive segregation for however long he was at the Albany \nCounty Jail, so he should just โadmit to everythingโ so that it can โgo easy.โ \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 49 of 103\n \n275.  Steven had no opportunity to prepare for the hearing and was not given an \nopportunity to identify or call witnesses. \n276.  The hearing officer, Defendant Sergeant Colangione, sentenced Steven to \nan extraordinary 600 days in solitary confinement. \n277.  On April 10, 2018, Steven appeared on his Bronx criminal matter before \nJustice Armando Montano.  At that time, Justice Montano directed Stevenโs release from \npunitive segregation. \n278.  Steven remains in solitary confinement, where he has been continuously \nsince February 13, 2018, in violation of a court order. \n279.  Steven has been kept in a small solitary cell for at least 23 hours a day.  \nSteven has nothing to do in his cell: no meaningful human interaction, no education or \nprogramming, no music or television, and limited reading materials. \n280.  He has limited access to phone calls, is not permitted to talk to other \ndetainees, and other than access to showers three times a week, he is not permitted to leave his \ncell.    \n281.  Steven usually declines to spend his one hour a day of โrecreationโ in the \ncage outside his cell because it is not materially different from staying in his cell. \n282.  Steven does not have a high school diploma and has been denied access to \neducational services since February 12, 2018.  He has informed DOC and its Institutional Service \nUnit both verbally and in writing that he wishes to participate in educational services.  He \nreceived on educational packet in September 2018 but no other materials.  Steven was told by \ncorrections officers that he would receive no schooling while in the Albany County Jail. \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 50 of 103\n \n283.  Steven is permitted visitors one hour a week on Tuesdays from 3:30-4:30. \nBecause the Albany County Jail is such long a distance from his motherโs house in Pennsylvania, \nshe is unable to visit. \n284.  Steven is only permitted to access mental health services in his cell, when \na counselor will come to his cell and speak with him in the presence of a correction officer \nwithout privacy or confidentiality. \n285.  Steven has not received sufficient access to his criminal defense counsel \nsince February 13, 2018.  Orders to have Steven produced in court for attorney visits have gone \nunheeded.  On March 26, 2018, Justice Margaret Clancy signed an order to have Steven \nproduced to speak to his attorneys on April 4, 2018.  On April 27, 2018, Justice Shari Michels \nsigned an order to have Steven produced on May 1, 2018โa date on which other Rikers \ndetainees housed at the Albany County Jail were to be brought to court.  Both orders were \ntransmitted to the New York City DOCโand both orders went ignored. \n286.  On March 2, 2018, and March 13, 2018, Steven was scheduled to appear \nin Bronx Supreme Court Criminal Term.  Courts in New York City were open, and detainees \nhoused in detention centers closer to the Bronx courthouses were produced for their appearances.  \nBut Steven was not produced for his scheduled court appearances because of inclement weather. \n287.  Since the assault, Steven has continued to experience pain, emotional \ndistress, and traumatic thoughts.  He still has difficulty urinating normally and sometimes needs \nto be catheterized to have urine removed from his bladder. \n288.  As recently as January 19, 2019, Steven was required to use a catheter and \ncarry a drainage bag at all times at the direction of an outside urologist, as he is still experiencing \ndifficulty urinating. \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 51 of 103\n \nE.  Defendants Brutally Assault Steven Espinal Again on July 4, 2018 \n \n289.  On the morning of July 4, 2018, a nurse was making medical rounds in 4 \nEast at the Albany County Jail. \n290.  Steven was in Cell #11.  He was sleeping and did not hear the nurseโs \nquestions.  As a result, he did not respond. \n291.  Steven sometimes has difficulty waking up because he takes psychiatric \nmedication that makes him tired. \n292.  When Steven did not respond to the nurseโs questions, several correction \nofficers entered his cell. \n293.  They pinned him to the bed, handcuffed him, and shackled him. \n294.  The officers then beat Steven for failing to respond to the nurse. \n295.  The officers grabbed Stevenโs hair and sprayed him in the face with \npepper spray at close range. \n296.  The officers kicked, punched, and elbowed Steven while he was \nhandcuffed and shackled. \n297.  After the assault, Steven had difficult opening his jaw, which was swollen \nand very painful. \n298.  Steven also had a deep cut over his left temple. \n299.  He had pain in his chest, neck, and back. \n300.  Steven was taken to Albany Medical Center.  Upon arrival at the hospital, \nSteven was unable to open his jaw. \n301.  Doctors noted an abrasion to the top of Stevenโs left shoulder, as well as \nโ[h]ead traumaโ and โ[l]eft jaw pain and swelling post assault.โ   \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 52 of 103\n \n302.  Steven was given a CT scan of the head, neck, and cervical spine, which \nrevealed no fractures.  The doctor found โasymmetrical soft tissue edema and contusion along \nthe lateral aspect of the left mandible.โ \n303.  A doctor also observed a laceration on the left side of Stevenโs face. \n304.  The medical diagnosis given to Steven by Albany Medical Center was \nโassault.โ \nF.  Notices of Claim \n \n305.  Within ninety days after the February 13, 2018, assault upon Steven, \nwritten Notices of Claim, sworn by Steven, were served upon the City of New York at the \nComptrollerโs Office at 1 Centre Street, New York, New York and upon the County of Albany at \n112 State Street, Albany, New York. \n306.  On October 5, 2018, a written notice of claim pertaining to the July 4, \n2018 assault, sworn by Plaintiff, was served upon the County of Albany at 112 State Street, \nAlbany, New York.  \n307.  An examination pursuant to General Municipal Law ยง 50-h was conducted \nby the County of Albany on November 21, 2018, at which counsel for the County inquired of \nSteven as to both the February 13 and the July 4 assaults. \n308.  By written agreement, the County has stipulated to the timeliness of the \nOctober 5 notice of claim and has waived and forfeited any defense concerning its timeliness. \n309.  Counsel for the City of New York was invited to participate in the 50-h \nhearing on November 21 but declined. \n310.  At least thirty days have elapsed since the service of the Notices of Claim, \nand adjustment or payment of the claim has been neglected or refused. \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 53 of 103\n \n311.  This action has been commenced within one year and ninety days after the \nhappening of the events upon which the claims are based. \nJohn Doe \nA.  John Doe Was Detained at Rikers Island on December 18, 2015 \n   \n312.  John Doe is a 25-year-old Latino man from the Bronx. \n313.  Doe was arrested on December 17, 2015, and was incarcerated in the \ncustody of DOC, mainly on Rikers Island, beginning on that date. \nB.  After a Visit from a High-Ranking DOC Security Official, John Doe Is \nTransferred to the Ulster County Correctional Facility on an SJO \n \n314.  On or about January 16, 2018, Doe was housed in unit 9 South at the \nManhattan Detention Complex (โMDCโ), in Lower Manhattan. \n315.  Defendant Sullivan came to see Doe in 9 South on or about January 16, \n2018. \n316.  Doe was in the cage outside his cell when Defendant Sullivan came. \n317.  Defendant Sullivan asked Doe, in sum and substance, โWhy are you not \nlocked in?  Typical.โ \n318.  Doe responded that he did not know he was supposed to lock into his cell. \n319.  Defendant Sullivan said, in sum and substance, โThatโs OK.  Soon enough \nwe wonโt have to deal with your bullshit anymore.  Youโre going somewhere good, somewhere \nthat youโll like.โ \n320.  Doe did not know what Defendant Sullivan was talking about. \n321.  On January 17, 2018, Doe was transferred, along with other detainees, to \nthe Ulster County Jail on a substitute jail order. \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 54 of 103\n \n322.  Doe did not receive notice that he was going to be transferred out of New \nYork City in advance. \n323.  Doe did not know he was going to Ulster County until he got there. \nC.  John Doe Is Transferred from Ulster County to the Albany County Jail \n \n324.  Doe and the other Rikers detainees spent only about a week at the Ulster \nCounty Correctional Facility. \n325.  Defendant Williams has acknowledged in an affidavit submitted in \nanother proceeding that he knew Doe would only stay in Ulster County very briefly on his way \nto Albany.  Albany County indicated that it would not be able to receive the Rikers detainees \nuntil January 23, so Defendant Williams asked Ulster County whether it could briefly house \nthem until Albany was ready for them. \n326.  On or about January 24, 2018, Doe was transferred to the Albany County \nJail. \n327.  Doe arrived at the Albany County Jail at around 10:00 or 11:00 am on the \ndate of his transfer. \n328.  Doe was transported from Ulster to the Albany County Jail by New York \nCity DOC ESU officers. \n329.  When the door opened, Doe was met by the Green Team, dressed in riot \ngear and green vests. \n330.  Defendant Torrisi was in command of the Green Team. \nD.  Defendants Brutalize and Sexually Assault John Doe \n \n331.  The Green Team escorted Doe to a booking cell in which he was subjected \nto a strip search. \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 55 of 103\n \n332.  During the search process, Defendants gave bizarrely detailed and \nconfusing instructions about the manner and sequence in which Doe should remove his clothing. \n333.  As Doe tried to carry out the instructions, Defendants began to hit and \nkick him, claiming that Doe was carrying out their instructions improperly. \n334.  After knocking Doe to the ground, Defendants picked him back up and \ntold him to do a better job of listening to their instructions. \n335.  Defendants then brought Doe to the BOSS Chair, which did not indicate \nthe existence of any contraband in Doeโs body. \n336.  From the BOSS Chair, Defendants brought Doe to a room with an x-ray \ntable. \n337.  Defendants forcibly placed Doe on the x-ray table and held him down so \nthat he could be x-rayed. \n338.  Defendants said that the x-ray detected the presence of a razor secreted in \nDoeโs rectum. \n339.  In the x-ray room, Defendant Torrisi slapped Doe twice and said, in sum \nand substance, โGive me the weapon now, or this will be the worst day of your life.โ \n340.  Another correction officer hit Doe one time in the x-ray room. \n341.  From the x-ray room, Defendants took Doe to Cell #11 in 4 East. \n342.  Doe was naked in Cell #11 with eight to ten correction officers, including \nDefendants Poole, Kelly, Reddy, Lawson, Anzalone, Jarosz, and Harris. \n343.  In Cell #11, Defendants told Doe, in sum and substance, to remove the \nrazor they claimed to have seen in his body or they would kill him. \n344.  Defendants removed Doeโs handcuffs. \n51 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 56 of 103\n \n345.  Six to eight correction officers, including Defendant Torrisi, then began to \nassault Doe with their fists and batons. \n346.  During the assault, Defendants kept telling Doe to remove the blade from \nhis rectum. \n347.  At one point, a correction officer sprayed Doe in the face at close range \nwith pepper spray. \n348.  During the beating, a correction officer told Doe, in sum and substance: \nโWe kill people here.  Is that what you want?โ \n349.  During the events in Cell #11, Doe informed Defendants that he had a \nbullet in his right leg from being shot on a previous occasion. \n350.  In response, one of the correction officers began to stomp on Doeโs right \nleg in an effort to cause him further pain. \n351.  At a certain point during the beating in Cell #11, Defendant Torrisi told \nDoe, referring to the alleged contraband in his rectum: โEither you give it to us, or we go in and \nget it.โ \n352.  Doe responded by asking for food and water to stimulate his bowels. \n353.  In response, Defendant Torrisi slammed Doeโs head against the wall and \ncaused Doe to bend over. \n354.  Defendant Torrisi instructed a correction officer to put a baton in Doeโs \nrectum. \n355.  The officer jammed a baton into Doeโs rectum and repeatedly pushed it in \nand out. \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 57 of 103\n \n356.  When the officer removed the baton from Doeโs rectum, Doe saw blood \non the baton. \n357.  Defendant Torrisi asked Doe whether he had ever felt 50,000 volts course \nthrough his body. \n358.  At that point, an officer used a taser against Doe. \n359.  Doe involuntarily urinated on himself. \n360.  The taser wires remained attached to Doe. \n361.  Defendant Torrisi said, in sum and substance: โWeโre going to kill you.  \nThis isnโt Rikers anymore.โ \n362.  Defendants tased Doe a second time. \n363.  Doe involuntarily defecated on himself. \n364.  While Doe was lying on the ground in his own urine and feces, a \ncorrection officer inserted his finger into Doeโs rectum. \n365.  Defendants then tased Doe a third time, at which point Doe involuntarily \ndefecated on himself again. \n366.  A correction officer disconnected the wires of the taser from Doeโs body. \n367.  Defendants then shot Doe again with a different Taser.  Again he \ninvoluntarily defecated on himself. \n368.  At that point, Defendants told Doe that the weapon was no longer in his \nrectum. \n369.  After Doe was tased for the last time, one of the correction officers hit him \nand said, in sum and substance, โThatโs for getting your sh*t on my shoes, you f*cking animal.โ \n370.  Doe lost consciousness multiple times during the beating. \n53 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 58 of 103\n \nE.  Doe Is Denied Medical Attention and Made to Sleep in His Own Bodily \nWaste \n \n371.  After the beating in Cell #11, Defendants brought Doe back to the x-ray \nroom to be x-rayed a second time. \n372.  Doe asked for medical attention from the person in the x-ray room who \nappeared to be a medical professional, but his request was refused. \n373.  After the second x-ray, Defendants provided Doe with a jail jumper but \ndenied him the opportunity to clean himself and did not decontaminate him from the pepper \nspray they used against him. \n374.  Doe was taken to Cell #14 in 4 East. \n375.  That night, Doe was forced to sleep with the remnants of his own urine \nand feces stuck to his body. \n376.  The next morning, on January 25, 2018, Doe again requested medical \nattention. \n377.  Doe had an open wound on his forehead and two black eyes, and his left \neye was swollen shut. \n378.  Doeโs face was bruised and swollen, and his ribs and chest were bruised. \n379.  Doeโs rectum was damaged and bled for weeks after the incident. \n380.  Defendant Mylroie denied Doe medical attention and told him to take \nMotrin. \n381.  Doe was not examined by a physician until approximately a week after the \nbeating that occurred on January 24, 2018. \n54 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 59 of 103\n \n382.  The Albany County Jail reports concerning the January 24, 2018 assault \non Doe falsely state that Doe โturn[ed] off the wallโ to assault staff and โmoved toward staffโ in \nan aggressive manner: \nDuring  a  CERT  operation  processing  new  Rikerโs  [sic]  Island \nInmate Boarders, Inmate [Doe] was uncooperative during the initial \nstrip search in Booking by turning off the wall towards staff.  He \nwas taken to the floor & restrained by staff.  He was placed back on \nwall & the strip search was completed without further incident.  He \nwas then escorted to the X-ray room, where an X-ray was taken of \nhim, which was positive for contraband.  Inmate was then escorted \nto SHU Cell 11 . . . .  He was again taken to the floor & restrained \nafter he turned away from the wall & lunged at staff.  . . .  Capt. \nHarris relieved Sgt. Poole & gave Inmate [Doe] several direct orders \nto remove the item.  Capt. Harris applied two separate five second \ntaser cycles to inmate, when he did not comply with orders & moved \ntoward staff with his hands & arms covered in feces. \n \nF.  John Doe Is Placed in Solitary Confinement at the Albany County Jail \n \n383.  Doe was issued an infraction ticket on January 24, 2018 that charged him \nwith assaulting staff, among other offenses. \n384.  A disciplinary hearing was held on February 6, 2018. \n385.  At the hearing, Doe denied the charges and explained that he had been \nsubjected to an unlawful search and that his rights had been violated. \n386.  In response, the hearing officer, Defendant Carhart, said, in sum and \nsubstance, โOK, you talk a good game, but we are still going to find you guilty regardless.โ \n387.  Defendant Carhart sentenced Plaintiff Doe to the extraordinary sum of 550 \ndays in solitary confinement. \n388.  Doe spent approximately the next ten months in solitary confinement \nwithout meaningful human contact. \n55 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 60 of 103\n \n389.  Doe had previously spent time in solitary confinement at Rikers Island, \nbut the time in solitary in Albany was significantly more difficult because he had no outdoor \nrecreation, no visitors, limited phone access, and very little contact with other detainees. \n390.  During the time in his cell, Doe thought constantly about the assault that \nhappened on the day he arrived. \n391.  He was alone and felt terrified. \n392.  Doe became paranoid that the correction officers at the Albany County \nJail were tampering with his food. \n393.  Doe usually chose not to take his one daily hour of โrecreationโ outside \nhis cell because it was functionally no different than staying in his cell. \nG.  Defendants Attempt to Intimidate John Doe \n \n394.  On or about January 26, 2018, Torrisi came to Doeโs cell prior to a legal \nvisit that Doe received from an attorney. \n395.  Defendant Torrisi told Doe, in sum and substance, โIf you snitch on us, we \nwill come up here at four in the morning and put you in a body bag.  We will kill you.  We do \nthat up here.โ \n396.  Torrisi asked Doe if he was a gang member. \n397.  When Doe said no, Torrisi punched him in the face and called him a liar. \n398.  On or about March 18, 2018, Defendant Torrisi again punched Doe in the \nface in retaliation for Doeโs complaints about having been sexually assaulted. \n399.  Since the assault on January 24, 2018, Doe has continued to experience \npain, emotional distress, and traumatic thoughts.  He frequently thinks about the assault, and \nruminates about it. \n56 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 61 of 103\n \n400.  While he was detained at the Albany County Jail, John Doe was terrified \nas a result of the assault.  He was afraid to eat because he became scared that guards were \npoisoning his food.  \n401.  On October 29, 2018, Doe pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a \ncontrolled substance in the third degree. \n402.  Doe is now serving his sentence in the custody of DOCCS. \n403.  Doe considered the plea offer to be a poor one with a long sentence, but he \nchose to accept it anyway so he could get out of the Albany County Jail and into a different \nfacility. \nPariis Tillery \nA.  Pariis Tillery Is Detained By DOC Starting on March 4, 2017 \n \n404.  Pariis Tillery is a 25-year-old African-American young man detained at \nthe Albany County Jail, where he is currently in solitary confinement. \n405.  Pariis received a GED and then completed two semesters at the New York \nCity College of Technology. \n406.  Although he has criminal matters pending in the Brooklyn County \nSupreme Court, Pariis has no adult criminal convictions.  \n407.  On or about March 4, 2017, Pariis was arrested and placed in the custody \nof the New York City DOC. \n408.  Pariis was first detained at the Brooklyn Detention Center, where, on \nAugust 7, 2018, he was accused of assaulting a correction officer. \n409.  On August 8, 2018, Pariis was transferred to Rikers Island. \n57 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 62 of 103\n \nB.  The August 9, 2018 Transfer of Pariis Tillery from Rikers to the Albany \nCounty Jail \n \n410.  On August 9, 2018, Defendants Brann and Williams obtained an SJO \ntransferring Pariis to Albany County. \n411.  On August 9, 2018, a DOC captain woke Pariis up in the early morning \nand told him to get dressed because ESU was coming for him.  Pariis asked where he was going \nbut was not given an answer.  \n412.  ESU officers came for Pariis and put him in a transport van. \n413.  Before being removed from Rikers, Pariis was given no written \nnotification of the basis of his transfer, received no hearing, and was not permitted to call his \nfamily or lawyers to inform anyone of his whereabouts.  He was not even told that he was going \nto be transferred. \n414.  ESU officers drove Pariis in the van for several hours.  He was the only \nperson in the van.  Pariis did not know where he was being taken.  He asked repeatedly where he \nwas going but no one would tell him.  \n415.  When the van door opened, Pariis saw a squad of approximately 12 law \nenforcement officers standing in front of him, wearing green fatigues and riot gear, including \nhelmets and body armor.  Pariis would later learn that these were correction officers from the \nAlbany County Jail.  \n416.  Several green-suited officers grabbed Pariis and took him to the intake \narea of the Albany County Jail.  About two to three Rikers ESU officers who had brought Pariis \nfrom Rikers also entered the Jail. \n417.  Pariis followed all orders given to him and was cooperative throughout  \nthis process.  \n58 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 63 of 103\n \n \nC.  Defendants Physically Assault Pariis Tillery at the Albany County Jail \n \n418.  After Pariis was cuffed and shackled, several Albany County Jail \ncorrection officers moved him into Booking Cell #2 and removed his handcuffs.  \n419.  About eight to ten Albany County Jail correction officers and supervisors \nwere waiting for him there.  Defendants Lawson, Moore, Jarosz, Harris, and Coppolo were \npresent.  \n420.  One Albany correction officer said to him: โDo the same thing you did on \nRikers Island.โ \n421.  One of the Defendants said to Pariis, โDo you know where you are at?โ  \nWhen Pariis said โno,โ the Defendant punched Pariis in the face.  Eight or nine correction \nofficers then proceeded to beat Pariis about his face and body.   \n422.  Pariis began to bleed from his nose.  Defendants placed a โspit maskโ on \nhis face, though Pariis was not spitting at anyone. \n423.  Defendants Lawson, Moore, Jarosz, Harris, and Coppolo punched, kicked, \nand stomped on Pariis. \n424.   Pariis fell to the floor, where Defendants continued to kick and punch \nhim.  \n425.  After beating him for approximately 10 minutes, Defendants brought \nPariis to the BOSS chair and instructed him to pass through a metal detector to search for \ncontraband.  Pariis complied with all instructions.  The BOSS chair did not indicate the presence \nof contraband on Pariisโs person. \n59 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 64 of 103\n \n426.  Defendants then stated to Pariis, in sum and substance: โDo you have \nsomething?  You Rikers guys are always lying.  If you do have something, weโre going to beat \nyou until you sh*t it out.โ  \n427.  Defendants then brought Pariis to an x-ray room and ordered him to \nsubmit to a medical x-ray to search for contraband.  Pariis complied.  \n428.  Defendants then escorted Pariis to Cell #14 in 4 East.  \n429.  Defendants instructed Pariis to remove his jumpsuit.  Pariis complied.  \n430.  Defendants then brandished a taser at Pariis.  \n431.  One Defendant stated to Pariis, โTake it out of your ass, you monkey.โ  \n432.  Defendants then hit, punched and kicked Pariis multiple times.  An officer \nsaid, in sum and substance, โWeโre going to get that out of you,โ referring to the alleged \ncontraband.  \n433.  The assault on Pariis in Cell #14 lasted for a significant period of time.  \n434.  Pariis was taken back for another x-ray and then returned to his cell.  \n435.  Defendant Mylroie came to his cell and observed his bleeding nose and \nother visible injuries and told him he was fine.  \n436.  Pariis was in extreme pain after the assault and passed out.  He could not \nhear out of his left ear and his head hurt.  His nose was swollen, and he had two black eyes, \ndizziness, and bruises over much of his body. \n437.  Pariis told correction officers that his head hurt and that he could not hear \nfrom his left ear.  He requested medical attention on August 10, 2018. \n438.  Four days after he was assaulted, on August 13, 2018, Pariis was finally \ntaken for treatment of the serious injuries he suffered during the August 9 assault.   \n60 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 65 of 103\n \n439.  Despite the presence of correction officers with him at the hospital, Pariis \ntold the medical personnel that he had been assaulted by correction officers at Albany County \nJail. \n440.  Albany County Jail medical records dated August 13, 2018, document that \nhe had โTrauma to Headโ and โBlood in Ear,โ as well as โecchymosis to orbits.โ  The Albany \nCounty Jail records request that the outside medical provider rule out โskull fractureโ and \nโcranial trauma.โ \n441.  At the emergency room of Albany Memorial Hospital, Pariis was \ndiagnosed with tympanic membrane perforation, head injury, and a concussion.  He was \nprescribed an antibiotic and given multiple CT scans for possible fractures in his skull, face, or \nbody. \n442.  Tympanic membrane perforation, or a ruptured eardrum, is a hole in the \neardrum.  It is an injury commonly caused by severe trauma to the head. \n443.  The Manual on Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and \nOther Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (2004), commonly known as the \nIstanbul Protocol, is the authoritative United Nations document which sets forth international \nguidelines on how to investigate allegations of torture.  Chapter 5 of The Istanbul Protocol, titled \nโPhysical Evidence of Torture,โ states: โTrauma to the ears, especially rupture of the tympanic \nmembrane, is a frequent consequence of harsh beatings.โ  It goes on to describe how to conduct \nan examination of the tympanic membrane and ear for injuries and hearing loss related to abuse \nand torture. \n444.  After his return from Albany Memorial Hospital, Pariis was sent back to \nsolitary confinement in Cell #14 on 4 East. \n61 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 66 of 103\n \n445.  On or about August 14, 2018, Pariisโs mother and grandmother traveled \nby bus from Brooklyn to Albany to visit him and observed his injuries from the beating. \n446.  Albany County Jail medical records dated August 20, 2018 document that \nPariis suffered a โL TM perforation, concussion, Head Injuryโ on August 9, 2018 and that he \nwas โsent to ER on 8/13/18 because of ear pain L TM perf.  He was started on Augmentin and \nreferred to ENT.  CT head/cspine/facial bones negative.โ \n447.  One month after the assault on September 4, 2018, Pariis was taken to see \na doctor at Albany Medical Center to assess the perforation to his left ear.  Albany Medical \nCenter records from that visit document that Pariis had suffered โsignificant facial abrasions and \nperiorbital ecchymosesโ as a result of the assault. \n448.  Periorbital ecchymosis, or โraccoon eye,โ is produced by blood tracking \ninto periorbital tissues, which is a frequent symptom after traumatic injuries to the head and \nneck. \n449.  Albany County Jail medical records dated November 18, 2018, document \nthat Pariis continues to suffer from headaches from the assault. \n450.  The Albany County Jail reports about the assault against Pariis claim that \nhe repeatedly โturned aroundโ to assault multiple staff members in riot gear while locked in a \nconfined space:   \nAt the above date and time, Inmate Tillery was admitted to the SHU.  \nInmate Tillery was escorted to Holding Cell 2 for the read in to be \ncompleted.  When the mechanical restraints were removed, Inmate \nTillery immediately turned around and began throwing punches at \nofficers.  Inmate was taken to the floor and restrained.  Once \ncompliant, Inmate was placed back on the wall.  During the strip \nsearch, Inmate again turned towards staff, threw punches, and began \nspitting.  Spit mask applied,  Inmate restrained. \n \n62 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 67 of 103\n \n451.  After the assault, Defendant Lyons came to Pariisโs cell and stated: โYou \nare not on Rikers anymore, we run this jail.โ \n452.  Since the assault on August 9, 2018, Albany County Jail guards have \ncontinued to taunt Pariis about the beating, stating that when he first arrived at Albany County \nJail, โyou were crying like a little girl.โ \n453.  Pariis has also heard Defendant Torrisi use racial epithets toward another \nAfrican-American detainee in SHU.  Defendant Torrisi stated to another detainee within Pariisโs \nhearing: โYouโve got to be the stupidest ni**er I ever met.  Do you want to get beat up?โ \nD.  Pariis Tillery Is Held in Solitary Confinement at the Albany County Jail \nfrom August 9, 2018 to January 23, 2019 \n \n454.  An infraction ticket that falsely accused Pariis of assaulting staff, dated \nAugust 9, 2018, was generated. \n455.  A disciplinary hearing was held on August 24, 2018, at which Pariis \nappeared. \n456.  Pariis had no opportunity to prepare for the hearing and was not given an \nopportunity to identify or call witnesses.  No testimony was taken at the hearing.  The hearing \nwas not transcribed or recorded in any way. \n457.  The hearing officer, Defendant Armstrong, sentenced Pariis to 300 days in \nsolitary confinement. \n458.  Pariis remained in solitary confinement from August 9, 2018 to January \n23, 2019. \n459.  Pariis was kept in a small solitary cell for at least 23 hours a day.  Pariis \nhad nothing to do in his cell: no meaningful human interaction, no education or programming, no \nmusic or television, and limited reading materials. \n63 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 68 of 103\n \n460.  Pariis initially had no access to phone calls and was denied the right to \ncontact his lawyer for his pending criminal case, interfering with his ability to participate in his \nown defense. \n461.  Pariis then gained limited access to phone calls, but was not permitted to \ntalk to other detainees, and other than access to showers three times a week, he was not permitted \nto leave his cell.   The cost of collect phone calls from Albany was also prohibitive for Pariisโs \nfamily, since the charge is $25 for 30 minutes. \n462.  Pariis usually declined to spend his one hour a day of โrecreationโ in the \ncage outside his cell because it is not materially different from staying in his cell. \n463.  Pariis was permitted visitors one hour a week.  To visit, his elderly mother \nhad to take a long bus ride from New York City.  The cost of the transportation for the visit was \noften prohibitive for her.  Because of the distance, cost, a physical disability, and her age, she \nwas rarely able to visit Pariis in Albany.  When he was detained in New York City, she visited \nPariis frequently, as did other family members and friends. \n464.  Pariis has family, including a one-year-old son, whom he did not see while \nheld in the Albany County Jail because of the distance.  When he was in New York City, Pariis \nreceived visits from and had contact with his young son on a regular basis. \n465.  At the Albany County Jail, Pariis was only permitted to access mental \nhealth services in his cell, when a counselor would come to his cell and speak with him in the \npresence of a correction officer without privacy or confidentiality. \n466.  Since the assault by Defendants, Pariis has continued to experience \nheadaches, dizziness, tinnitus, ear and other pain, emotional distress, and traumatic thoughts. \n64 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 69 of 103\n \n467.  On January 23, 2019โless than four weeks after this lawsuit was filedโ\nPariis had a scheduled court date in Brooklyn.  That morning, Albany jail staff told him to pack \nhis things and said he was being transferred.  After court, Pariis was not returned to Albany, and \nwas instead taken to the Anna M. Kross Center on Rikers Island, where he is now detained. \n468.  No one explained to Pariis why he had been sent back to Rikers, how long \nhe will remain there, or whether he will be subject to further transfers in the future. \n\t\nIX.  The Experiences of Other New York City Detainees Transferred to Albany \n \n469.  Other New York City detainees transferred to Albany County have been \nsubjected to the same brutality, following the same pattern. \nRichard Roe \n470.  On January 24, 2018, a then-24-year-old African-American detainee \nRichard Roe arrived at the Albany County Jail from Ulster County along with Plaintiff John Doe. \n471.  Albany County Jail officers, under the direction of Defendant Torrisi, beat \nRichard Roe in his assigned cell in 4 East. \n472.  Richard Roe was later sentenced to 450 days in solitary confinement. \n473.  Once again, official reports from the Albany County Jail falsely claim that \nofficers had to use force defensively after the detainee โturned off the wallโ: \nCERT Team 1 escorted [the inmate] through the booking process, \nx-ray and escort to the SHU.  After a positive x-ray for contraband, \ninmate was placed on the wall in his cell and ordered to remove the \nobject.  Inmate turned off the wall 2 times and was taken to the \nfloor . . . . \n \n65 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 70 of 103\n \nDavid Doe \n474.  Other detainees who arrived at the Albany County Jail with Plaintiff \nSteven Espinal on February 13, 2018 were also beaten. \n475.   On January 24, 2018, 18-year old detainee David Doe arrived at the \nAlbany County Jail from Rikers. \n476.  Albany County Jail officers, under the direction of Defendant Torrisi, \nrepeatedly punched David Doe in his face and body in a booking cell when he was unable to \nfollow commands to remove his clothing in a specific way. \n477.  After officers claimed to have seen an object in his rectum on an x-ray, the \nofficers took David Doe to Cell #16 in 4 East.  There, they continued to beat David Doe until \nthey claimed that the object had been removed. \n478.  David Doe, who has since turned 19, remains at the Albany County Jail in \nsolitary confinement. \nX.  Class Allegations \n \n479.  The Plaintiff Class consists of every person who is or will be detained at \nthe Albany County Jail after being transferred there on a SJO by the City. \n480.  This action is properly maintainable as a class action because all four \nrequirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) are satisfied. \n481.  Numerosity.  The members of the class are sufficiently numerous that \njoinder of all members is impracticable.  Between March 8, 2018 and August 15, 2018, 21 SJOs \nwere issued transferring detainees from the City to the Albany County Jail.  On information and \nbelief, there are presently about ten Rikers detainees at the Albany County Jail.  Based on past \n66 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 112   Filed 06/06/19   Page 71 of 103\n \npractice, the City is likely to transfer 50 or more additional detainees to the Albany County Jail \nduring the pendency of this case alone. \n482.  Commonality.  There are questions of law and fact common to the class.  \nThese include, without limitation: (a) whether Cityโs practice of transferring City detainees to the \nAlbany County Jail unreasonably obstructs their Sixth Amendment right to counsel in light of the \nAlbany County Jailโs distance from New York City; (b) whether confidential attorney-client \ncommunications are reasonably available to City detainees at the Albany County Jail; (c) \nwhether City detainees have constitutionally protected liberty interests in not being held in \npunitive segregation, either at all or for longer than certain periods of time; (d) whether Albany \nCounty has a policy or custom of subjecting City detainees to violent torture; and (e) whether the \nCity is deliberately indifferent to an unreasonable risk to City detaineesโ safety by transferring \nthem to the Albany County Jail. \n483.  Typicality.  Steven Espinalโs claims are typical of the claims of class \nmembers he seeks to represent.  The violations of his right to counsel and his procedural and \nsubstantive due process rights are shared by all City detainees transferred to Albany.  All \nmembers of the class will rely on similar legal theories, and all members of the class have \nsuffered similar harms. \n484.  Adequacy of Representation.  Steven Espinal is an adequate class \nrepresentative.  He is in solidarity with his fellow detainees who are suffering, or will suffer, the \nsame deplorable conditions.  He will fairly and adequately protect the interests of other class \nmembers.

101\nPlaintiffs, by and through their attorneys, Emery Celli Brinckerhoff & Abady LLP and \nthe Law Offices of Goldman & Associates, for their Complaint allege as follows: \nNATURE OF THE ACTION \n(cid:3)\n1.  Early one morning, without warning, a van comes to the jail for the young \nmen.  They have been in that jail for months or even years, but they have not been convicted of \nany crimes. \n2.  The young men are shackled and put in the back of the van.  The van has \nno windows.  They do not know where they are going. \n3.  The van drives for hours.  It eventually comes to a stop at the end of a road \nat the back of an airfield.  The doors open in a place the young men have never seen before.   \n4.  A dozen guards in green fatigues and body armor are there waiting.  They \ntell the young men to get out of the van one by one.  The guards take the young men inside a \nbuilding and put them in cages.   \n5.  The guards deliver commands that are bizarrely detailed and confusing.  \nTake off your shirt with your right hand and pass it backward over your left shoulder, they say.  \nWhen the young men, disoriented, get it wrong, the guards โrespondโ with blows and punches. \n6.  The guards yell that the young men are hiding things in their bodies.  They \npunch and kick the young men.  Get it out, the guards say.  The guards curse and threaten to kill \nthem.  Get it out, the guards demand.  Some of the young men are shot with tasers in-between \nbeatings.  Guards insert their fingers and batons into the young menโs rectums.  We will get it out \nfor you, they threaten.  The young men lie naked on the floor, crying, pleading, covered in their \nown urine and feces.  Get it out, get it out.  The guards will not stop. \n \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 6 of 101\n7.  The commander finally tells the guards that it is enough.  The guards \nleave.  The young men are left in cages, alone.  They sit there by themselves around the clock, in \nisolation, for weeks, months, even years. \n8.  There are no rules, no procedures, and no laws in this place.  The young \nmen are far from their families, far from their lawyers, cut off from the outside world.  They fear \nthat they could be killed at any moment and no one would know what happened to them.  Their \nfear is not unreasonable: that is what the guards tell them might happen. \n9.  These young men are not in the custody of a repressive foreign regime; \nthey are not suspected terrorists rendered by the CIA.  The โblack siteโ to which they have been \ntaken without warning is not a decrepit Iraqi prison or an air base in the Polish countryside.  \nThey are pretrial detainees in the custody of the City of New York, and the black site is the \nAlbany County Correctional Facility. \n10.  This case is about young men from New York City who have been \nshipped up to Albany County to be beaten and punished for crimes they have not been convicted \nof committing.  It is about the Cityโs policy of knowingly sending these young men to Albany to \nbe tortured; it is about Albany Countyโs policy of torturing them; and it is about the correction \nofficers who carry out the torture. \n11.  More than anything else, however, this case is about the rest of us, living \noutside the jail walls.  It is about the authority that is being quietly exercisedโand viciously \nabusedโon our behalf.(cid:3)  \n12.  We, the People, have decided through our Constitution that not even the \nmost despised detainees may be tortured.  Not even someone who has assaulted a correction \nofficer.  Not even an alleged gang member.  Not even someone who is hiding contraband in his \n2 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 7 of 101\nbody.  We are a society of laws, and due processโthe idea that sets us apart from repressive \nregimes worldwideโforbids this. \n13.  In New York City, the law forbids subjecting teenage pretrial detainees to \n23 or 24-hour solitary confinement, even if the teenagers are difficult to control, break rules, or \nhurt others.  Locking college-age young men in cages for 23 hours a day with no human contact \nis not just cruel.  It is a form of torture.  It does not reduce violence or promote jail safety.  It \nsimply inflicts permanent damage on developing minds too young to be beyond redemption. \n14.  Our commitment to due process and the rule of law binds us even when it \nis hard.  It governs even in the darkest corners of far-away jails and it protects evenโindeed, \nespeciallyโthe least popular, the most reviled of our fellow human beings. \n15.  People are being tortured in our names.  This time it is happening much \ncloser to home, and it is happening to Americans.  It is time for the torture to stop.  It is time to \nbring these young men home to New York City. \nPARTIES \n(cid:3)\n16.  Plaintiff Davon Washington is a 19-year-old man who resides in the \nBronx, New York.

New York Cityโs Ban on Solitary Confinement for Young People \n(cid:3)\n29.  In August 2014, the United States Department of Justice (โDOJโ) issued \nan investigative report on conditions at Rikers Island.  DOJ found, among other things, that the \nCity improperly relied on solitary confinement as a tool to manage adolescent detainees, \nโexpos[ing] them to a risk of serious harmโ and raising serious constitutional concerns.  DOJ \nfound that putting adolescents in solitary created a โvicious cycle.โ  Disruptive and unstable \ndetainees became more disruptive and unstable when they were put in solitary, isolated from \nsocial support and necessary services, and given little incentive to improve their behavior.1 \n30.  In October 2014, the New Yorker told the story of Kalief Browder, who \nspent three years on Rikers Island as a teenager after being accused of stealing a backpack.2  \nKalief spent nearly 17 consecutive months in solitary confinement before the charges against \nhim were dismissed.  While in solitary, he became paranoid and repeatedly attempted suicide.  \nAfter he got out, he had constant flashbacks to his time in solitary and made more suicide \nattempts.  Kalief killed himself less than a year after the article appeared. \n31.  Both developments brought public attention to the Cityโs gross \noverreliance on solitary confinement for young pretrial detainees.  And they happened against a \nbackdrop of growing societal recognition of the harm of solitary confinement, particularly for \nyoung people. \n(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)\n1   See U.S. Depโt of Justice, CRIPA Investigation of the New York City Department of Correction Jails on \nRikers Island, Aug. 4, 2014, https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/usao-sdny/legacy/2015/03/25/SDNY \n%20Rikers%20Report.pdf. \n2   Jennifer Gonnerman, Before the Law, The New Yorker, Oct. 6, 2014, https://www.newyorker.com \n/magazine/2014/10/06/before-the-law. \n8 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 13 of 101\n32.  There is clear scientific consensus that long-term solitary confinement \ninflicts grave psychiatric injury.  According to the American Psychiatric Association, solitary is \nassociated with increased risk of self-mutilation and suicidal ideation, greater anxiety, \ndepression, and paranoia.3  About half of all prison suicides happen among the roughly 5 to 6 \npercent of inmates held in solitary.4 \n33.  Cognition tends to deteriorate in solitary.  Many people held in solitary \nexperience hallucinations and delusions, and some suffer full-blown psychosis, losing touch with \nthe world around them.  One eminent psychologist and criminologist has described the isolated \ndetaineesโ mental state as โisolation panicโโa feeling of desperation, abandonment, and \nhelplessness that feeds rage, panic, and loss of control.5   \n34.  These risks are particularly acute for young people.  Immature adolescent \nbrains are even less well equipped than fully developed adult brains to handle the rigors of \nprolonged isolation.  A 2014 study of detainees in New York City jails found that the two biggest \npredictors of self-harm were being under age 19 and having been placed in solitary confinement \nat least once.6 \n35.  Solitary also poses unique threats to young people.

Solitary confinement can provoke or accelerate the onset of \nthese serious mental illnesses for teenage detainees. \n36.  Recent developments in constitutional law recognize that the penal system \nmust treat teenagers differently than adults because their immature brains function differently.7 \n37.  In this context, in January 2015, the New York City Board of Correction \n(the โBoardโ) adopted a regulation banning solitary confinement (or โpunitive segregationโ) for \ndetainees age 21 and younger in New York City (the โUnder Age 22 Solitary Banโ). \n38.  The Board is an independent body of the City that is responsible for \noverseeing and evaluating the performance of DOC.  The Board is required to establish \nMinimum Standards for the treatment of detainees held by the City.8  Those Minimum Standards \nare regulations with binding legal effect, codified in the Rules of the City of New York, which \nDOC is obligated to follow.9 \n39.  In promulgating the Under Age 22 Solitary Ban, the Board found: \nโ[P]unitive segregation is a severe penalty that should not be used in certain circumstances in \n[DOC] facilities.  In particular, punitive segregation reflects a serious threat to the physical and \npsychological health of adolescents, with respect to whom it should not be imposed.โ10 \n40.  The Under Age 22 Solitary Ban immediately forbid the placement of \ndetainees under age 18 in solitary.  It further provided that, as of January 1, 2016, detainees ages \n18 through 21 โshall be excludedโ from solitary, โprovided that sufficient resources are made \n(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)\n7     See Roper v.

The Under Age 22 Solitary Ban received glowing press coverage and \npraise from advocates for detaineesโ rights.  Mayor de Blasio trumpeted that the City would now \nโbe at the forefront of national jail reform efforts.โ12 \n42.  In July 2015, the City submitted to a consent decree in Nunez v. City of \nNew York designed to reduce excessive force by officers against detainees on Rikers Island, \nrespond to DOJโs concerns, and reform the Cityโs jails.  To that end, the City agreed in the \nconsent decree to additional reforms relating to solitary confinement for young people.13    \n43.  In practice, however, DOC has long been reluctant to reduce its use of \nsolitary confinement and has resisted implementing the Under Age 22 Solitary Ban.14  For a very \nlong time, solitary confinement had been a primary tool used at Rikers Island to deal with \nviolent, mentally ill, or difficult young inmates.15  Long-serving senior DOC officials, rank-and-\nfile staff, and the correction officersโ union were slow to embrace reform. \n44.  After the Under Age 22 Solitary Ban was passed, DOC requested and \nreceived a series of variances from the Board to delay the implementation of the ban on solitary \n(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)\n11   Id. tit. 40 ยง 1-17(b)(1)(ii). \n12   See, e.g., Mark Berman, New York City Will No Longer Put Its Youngest Prison Inmates in Solitary \nConfinement, Wash.

DOC claimed it needed more time to develop alternative \nprogramming. \n45.  Finally, in October 2016, the Board determined that DOC had been \nprovided with sufficient resources to implement alternative programming, and the variances \nended.  For the past two years, it has been unlawful for the City to keep a detainee under the age \nof 22 in solitary confinement. \n46.  Regulations passed by the Board also limit the amount of time DOC \ndetainees over age 21 can spend in solitary confinement.  For example, an adult detainee cannot \nspend more than 30 consecutive days in solitary confinement unless he has been sentenced for a \nserious assault on correctional staff.  The maximum sentence for a serious assault on staff is 60 \ndays in solitary confinement.16 \n47.  Even with the Under Age 22 Solitary Ban in effect and the limits on \nsolitary for adults, DOCโone of the largest jail systems in the worldโstill has powerful tools at \nits disposal to manage, isolate, and control difficult detainees to the extent it deems necessary. \n48.  The regulation passed by the Board in 2015 also forbid detainees between \n18 and 21 from being placed in โEnhanced Supervision Housingโ (โESHโ), a secure unit that is \nless restrictive than solitary (the โUnder Age 22 ESH Banโ).17  Detainees in ESH are entitled to \nat least seven hours outside their cells each day, during which they can socialize with other \ndetainees.  They can also receive some social visitors, and they have access to services and \nprograms accessible to detainees in the general population, including education and chaplains.18 \n(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)\n16   Rules of the City of New York tit. 40 ยงยง 1-16(d)(1) to (4). \n17   Id. ยง 1-16(c)(1)(ii). \n18   What is Enhanced Supervision Housing?, N.Y.C.

Since the Under Age 22 ESH Ban was passed, DOC has continuously \nrequested and received variances from the Board waiving its compliance with this requirement.  \nTherefore, it is currently permissible for DOC to send detainees between ages 18 and 21 to ESH, \nwhich is the most restrictive setting for detainees in that age group in DOC custody. \n50.    DOC maintains a restrictive housing unit at its West Facility on Rikers \nIsland, which, on information and belief, is designed to accommodate violent detainees who have \nnot been adequately controlled in other settings, as well as detainees who are in protective \ncustody for their own safety. \n51.  On information and belief, the North Infirmary Command facility at \nRikers also includes a highly secure unit designed to house difficult detainees under restrictive \nconditions. \nII.  The Substitute Jail Order Process \n \n52.  New York State law allows for the transfer of pretrial detainees between \nfacilities in different counties through a procedure known as a โsubstitute jail orderโ (โSJOโ).  \nSJOs are issued by the New York State Commission of Correction (โSCOCโ), a state body.19 \n53.  SCOC can only issue an SJO under certain specified conditions.  All \ninvolve imminent threats to safety and basic needs, like a natural disaster that makes a jail unfit \nto hold detainees, or an inability to provide โvital servicesโ like food or medical care at a jail.  \nMost relevant here, SCOC can issue an SJO โwhen the safety or security of a [detainee] or group \nof [detainees] is threatened by their confinement in a facility and the facility administrator \n(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)\n19   See generally N.Y.

State regulations create a mandatory procedure to get an SJO.  The \nadministrator of the original jailโwhich, for New York City jails, is Defendant Commissioner \nBrannโis responsible for finding another suitable jail to receive the detainee in question.  He or \nshe must first look for available options within his county.  If none exist, he or she may look to \nsee whether a jail outside the county can accommodate the detainee.  The administrator must \nconsider the proximity of the other jail, the inconvenience to the detaineeโs family and friends, \nthe impact on his access to legal counsel, and the ability of the receiving jail to keep the detainee \nsafe.21 \n55.  The administrator of the original facility is responsible for finding a \nreceiving jail, providing the relevant information to SCOC, and getting the substitute jail order \nfrom SCOC.  The original facility must make the logistical arrangements for the transfer.22  The \noriginal jurisdiction pays the receiving jurisdictionโs expenses of holding the detainees. \n56.  The regulations also allow for an urgent transfer from jail to jail under \nโextraordinary circumstancesโ in which โthe safety or security of a [detainee] cannot be \nmaintained.โ  Under those circumstances, the administrator of the original facility may make a \nwritten request to the New York State Commissioner of Corrections (the โState Commissionerโ) \nto make another facility available to hold the detainee.  The State Commissioner must respond \nwith a written determination that another facility is available to hold the detainee.23  The detainee \n(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)\n20   9 NYCRR ยง 7210.5. \n21   Id. ยง 7210.6. \n22   Id. \n23   Id. ยง 7210.6(e). \n14 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 19 of 101\nis transferred not to the custody of the receiving facility, but to the custody of the State \nCommissioner, who must house the detainee in the โmost proximate facility.โ  \n57.  Irrespective of the procedure by which a detainee is transferred, notice to \nthe detainee is always required.  The administrator of the receiving jail โshall provide [the \ndetainee] immediately with a written notification of the reasons for his transfer.โ24  The \ntransferred detainee โshall be entitled to all the rights and privileges available to other [detainees] \nof the receiving facility.โ25 \n58.  SJOs are a lucrative business for upstate county jails with excess capacity.  \nIn 2013, housing other countiesโ detainees on SJOs brought Albany County more than $3 million \nin revenue.  Sheriff Apple explained: โWe have the space.  Weโre trying to run our jail as a \nbusiness . . . .โ26 \nIII.  New York Cityโs Policy and Custom of Rendering Difficult Detainees Upstate to \nPunish Them By, Among Other Things, Putting Them in Solitary Confinement \n59.  The City continues to fall chronically short in preventing DOC officers \nfrom using unnecessary force against detainees.

In 2017 a bill was introduced in the New York City Council to amend the New York City \nAdministrative Code to provide City detainees with additional notice before they could be transferred out of the City \nby SJO.  The bill would requireโexcept in emergency circumstancesโthat, before any transfer, the detainee and his \ncriminal defense lawyer be given notice and the detainee be given a chance to make three personal phone calls at no \ncost.

The use of force has continued to increase rather than diminish, even as the \ninmate population has decreased.โ27  \n60.  Over the past few years, the City has dramatically increased its use of \nSJOs to send upstate young detainees whom it deems undesirable.  It has done so to circumvent \nits own ban on solitary confinement for detainees 21 and younger.  And it has done so even \nthough ESH and other facilities are available within New York City as secure units for detainees \nwho require that level of segregation. \n61.  A New York Times investigation published on July 22, 2018, found that \nโ[t]ransfers of inmates 21 and younger increased sharply starting in 2015, the year the city \nadopted the solitary ban, and except for a drop in 2017, the number of such transfers has \nremained well above the levels seen before the ban.โ28 \n62.  On information and belief, the City has sent dozens of detainees 21 and \nyounger to be held upstate since October 2015.  Between March 8, 2018 and August 15, 2018 \nalone, 21 SJOs were issued transferring detainees from Rikers to the Albany County Jail. \n63.  It is official City policy that solitary confinement โrepresents a serious \nthreat to the physical and psychological health of adolescents.โ29  And, because DOC has \nstopped requesting variances from the ban on solitary confinement for detainees aged 18-21, it \nhas been established as a matter of City law that DOC has โsufficient resourcesโ to implement \nโnecessary alternative programmingโ to maintain order without using solitary.30 \n(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)\n27   Steve J.

Nonetheless, the City continues to send detainees under 22 upstate on \nSJOs, expectingโindeed, knowingโthat they will be put in solitary confinement to punish \nthem. \n65.  In response to public scrutiny over the New York Times investigation, \nMayor de Blasio endorsed and ratified the Cityโs practice.  โOccasionally we have to remove a \nprisoner from our correction system because there is an immediate threat to them and something \nthat requires them being moved to another jurisdiction,โ the Mayor said on July 23, 2018. \n66.  Many of the young detainees transferred from Rikers on SJOs (โRikers \ndetaineesโ or โNew York City detaineesโ) have been charged with assaulting correction officers \non Rikers Island.  To the extent that these detainees face a โthreatโ at Rikers, to use the Mayorโs \nwords, that threat comes from retaliation by DOC staffโthe very staff hired by the City to \nmaintain order in its jails.  The Cityโs admission that it cannot keep detainees safe from unlawful \nviolence by its own officers is disturbing. \n67.  Rikers detainees are generally not told in advance that they are being sent \nout of New York City on an SJO.  They are simply told one morning by DOC correction officers \nto gather their personal effects.  They are strip-searched and shackled and loaded into a van.  \nBecause this is the same thing that happens when a detainee is moved from jail to jail on Rikers \nIsland, most assume that they are simply being transferred to another facility on Rikers.  \nSometimes DOC correction officers even tell the detainees they will be coming right back.  The \ndetainees are not permitted to call anyone before they leave.  \n68.   Correction officers from DOCโs Emergency Services Unit, or โESU,โ are \ngenerally responsible for transferring detainees.  Once detainees are loaded into the van, the van \nkeeps driving.  It has no windows, so detainees cannot see where they are going.  For many of \n17 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 22 of 101\nthe young detainees who are sent out of New York City on an SJO, the van finally stops in \nAlbany County. \n69.  The Albany County Jail is about a three-hour drive from New York City, \n160 miles from Rikers Island.  Being held at the Albany County Jail makes it more difficult for \ndetainees to communicate with their lawyers about their pending criminal cases.  It also cuts \ndetainees off from their friends and families, many of whom are indigent and do not have the \nmoney or time off work to take long trips to Albany to visit during narrow visiting hours that are \nfrequently early in the morning. \n70.  Albany County charges the City $175 a day for each City detainee it \nhouses at the Albany County Jail.31 \nIV.  Albany Countyโs Policy and Custom of Torturing Rikers Detainees  \n(cid:3)\n71.  New York City detainees from Rikers Island brought to Albany on SJOs \nare generally subject to the same routine of torture on arrival, with some variations, after which \nthey are almost uniformly put in solitary confinement. \n72.  When the van doors open, a group of approximately ten Albany County \ncorrection officers are there waiting.  They are wearing green paramilitary uniforms with riot \ngear, helmets, and visors.  This group of officers is called the โGreen Team.โ  Some of the Green \nTeam members have the iconic skull logo of the Punisherโa comic-book antihero who exacts \nviolent revenge on those who have wronged himโon the chest of their body armor.32 \n(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)\n31   Southall & Ransom, supra note 28. \n32   Whichever officers suit up in green fatigues and riot gear on a given day comprise the โGreen Team.โ  It is \nnot a separate unit with a fixed membership. \n18 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 23 of 101\n73.

The continued involvement of ESU officers is necessary because the detainee is still \nwearing DOC restraints that need to be returned to Rikers, to which ESU has the keys. \n75.  Each New York City detainee is escorted to the intake area inside the \nAlbany County Jail.  The ESU officers unshackle him and literally hand him over to the Green \nTeam, who then put him in Albany handcuffs.  The detainee is put in a booking cell with several \nGreen Team officers, where Torrisi begins commanding a choreographed routine of torture. \n76.  โThis isnโt Rikers,โ Torrisi routinely tells the detainee.  โWe do what we \nwant here.โ  The detainee is given a series of arbitrary and increasingly convoluted commands, \nin the nature of: โFace the wall with your right foot behind your left and your right hand higher \nthan your left,โ or โTake off your jumper with your right hand and pass it back to us over your \nleft shoulder.โ \n77.  If the detainee gets confused, as he invariably will, he gets punched. \n78.  Torrisi then tells the detainee, in sum and substance: โWeโre going to take \nthese cuffs off you.  When the cuffs come off, you start swinging.โ  The detaineeโs cuffs are \nremoved, and he is then tackled to the floor and beaten until Torrisi orders the Green Team to \nstop. \n79.  The DOC ESU officers who brought the New York City detainees to \nAlbany are, on information and belief, often present inside the intake area of the Albany County \n19 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 24 of 101\nJail when these things happen.  On information and belief, they can see and hear what is \nhappening and are able to intervene to stop it if they so choose, but they choose not to. \n80.  After intake, each Rikers detainee is taken to the โBOSS Chair,โ a body \nscanner designed to detect contraband stored in body cavities.  The detainee then goes through a \nmetal detector and is brought to a medical x-ray room to be x-rayed for contraband. \n81.  The Rikers detainee is then taken upstairs to the solitary confinement cell \nblock known as โ4 Eastโ and put in a cell which, on information and belief, has already been \nassigned to them. \n82.  At some point during this processโoften after the x-ray, but sometimes \nduring an initial strip search in the intake penโTorrisi claims to have seen contraband, whether \nreal or imagined, inside the Rikers detaineeโs rectum. \n83.  Jails have legitimate security needs and must prevent detainees from \nbringing contraband or weapons inside.  If a search identifies contraband in a detaineeโs body, \nthe appropriate responses may include placing the detainee in isolation and waiting until the \ndetainee expels the contraband or seeking the assistance of a medical professional to remove the \nitem with the detaineeโs consent. \n84.  It is unreasonable, unsafe, and inconsistent with standard correctional \npractice for a guard who has no medical training to attempt to forcibly remove contraband from a \ndetaineeโs rectum without his consent in a nonmedical environment. \n85.  For example, DOCCS, which runs all New York State prisons, allows \nmanual searches of body cavities other than the rectum to be conducted only by medical \npersonnel with the approval of the Deputy Commissioner or Chief Medical Officer of DOCCS, \n20 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 25 of 101\nin an examination room with appropriate medical equipment using appropriate medical \ntechniques.33 \n86.  DOCCS guidelines provide that โrectal cavity searches will not be \nauthorizedโ under any circumstances.34 \n87.  DOCโs own policies and procedures forbid any manual cavity searches by \nuniformed correctional staff.  DOC staff may not engage in โany probing or touching of the \ngenital or anal cavitiesโ when strip-searching detainees.  Rather, if DOC staff suspect the \npresence of contraband in a body cavity after visual inspection of the cavity, they must isolate \nthe detainee until he or she removes or passes the suspected contraband.35 \n88.  But the Green Team is not even engaged in a legitimate effort to conduct \nmanual body cavity searches at all.  Rather, it assaults and sexually assaults Rikers detainees \nunder the pretext of attempting to forcibly remove real or imagined contraband from their \nrectums, but with the real purpose of terrifying and intimidating the Rikers detainees. \n89.  Green Team officers sometimes use Tasers against cuffed Rikers \ndetainees; insert their fingers into detaineesโ rectums; and even sodomize detainees with foreign \nobjects.  These actions have no legitimate security purpose.  Rather, they are assaults designed to \nassert the dominance of correctional staff and humiliate, intimidate, and degrade detainees. \n90.  After undergoing this violent ritual on arrival at the Albany County Jail, \nRikers detainees often have visible injuries.  Invariably, Defendant Nurse Mylroie, widely \nknown as โMissy,โ is the assigned medical provider.  She refuses to give the detainees medical \n(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)\n33   See N.Y. State Depโt of Corr. & Cmty. Supervision Directive No. 4910, ยง III.H, Nov. 7, 2017, available at  \nhttp://www.doccs.ny.gov/Directives/4910.pdf. \n34   Id. ยง III.H.3. \n35   See N.Y.C. Depโt of Corr. Directive No. 4508R-E, ยง V.G.1 & app. B, May 15, 2009.  \n21 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 26 of 101\ncare, unhelpfully telling them that they are fine as long as they can walk and talk, and instructs \nthem to take Motrin. \n91.  After being beaten, Rikers detainees are written up for โassaulting staff,โ \namong other infractions.  The written tickets generally say that the detainee โturned off the wallโ \nor โturned aroundโ to assault staff. \n92.  That any of the Rikers detainees chose to spontaneously assault multiple \nofficers wearing helmets and full riot gear while locked in a confined space is entirely unlikely.  \nThat all of them did so rises to the level of systematic fabrication. \n93.  After they are assaulted upon arrival at the Albany County Jail, Rikers \ndetainees are given a disciplinary hearing at which they are told it does not matter what they say \nbecause they will be found guilty regardless.  They are found guilty of infractions at the hearing \nand sentenced to long periods of solitary confinement, often for well more than a year. \nV.  Albany Countyโs Policy and Custom of Putting All Rikers Detainees in Solitary \nConfinement \n(cid:3)\n94.  The Rikers detainees spend their remaining time at the Albany County Jail \nin solitary confinement.  They are in their cells by themselves for a minimum of 23 hours a day, \nwith no meaningful social interaction, environmental stimulation, or human contact.  They are \noffered one hour of โrecreationโ by themselves in an indoor cage and a 15-minute shower every \nother day.  Most decline the โrecreationโ time in the cage because the cage is functionally \nindistinguishable from their cells. \n95.  The Albany County Jailโs solitary confinement unit, known as โ4 East,โ \nconsists of approximately 20 cells arrayed on multiple tiers.  A typical cell is about 6 feet by 8 \nfeet. \n22 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 27 of 101\n96.  Sheriff Apple told the New York Times that it was the Albany County \nJailโs policy to put any detainee who has ever assaulted correctional staff, regardless of where or \nwhen, in solitary confinement.36 \n97.  On information and belief, every single New York City detainee who has \nbeen brought to the Albany County Jail on an SJO in the past two years has been beaten and put \nin solitary confinement.  Plaintiffs are unaware of any New York City detainee who was \nintegrated into the general population at the Albany County Jail. \n98.  On information and belief, the vast majority of the detainees housed in 4 \nEast at the Albany County Jail over the past two years have been from New York City. \nVI.  New York City Has Received Repeated Notice of Albanyโs Torture and Abuse of \nDOC Inmates, and Continues to Transfer Detainees There To Be Tortured  \n(cid:3)\n99.  The City and its policymakers are aware of the increased rate of transfers \nof Rikers detainees to the Albany County Jail after the City banned solitary confinement for \ndetainees 21 and younger.   \n100.  The City and its policymakers are aware that detainees routinely fail to \nreceive notice or an opportunity to be heard before being transferred outside the City on an SJO.  \nAnd they are aware that Rikers detainees have repeatedly alleged that guards at the Albany \nCounty Jail have beaten them.  \n101.  The City has failed to investigate or remediate these conditions and has \ncontinued sending detainees, including many aged 21 and younger, to the Albany County Jail \nwithout notice, to be beaten and put in solitary confinement. \n(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)\n36   Southall & Ransom, supra note 28. \n23 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 28 of 101\n102.  In August 2017, four New York City Council Members introduced a bill \nto amend City law to require that Rikers detainees be provided with notice before being \ntransferred outside the City on an SJO.  That bill is being considered by the relevant Council \ncommittee.37 \n103.  On March 3, 2018, Plaintiff Espinal filed a notice of claim with the \nComptroller of the City of New York.  In that notice, Plaintiff Espinal explained that, upon his \narrival in the Albany County Jail, he had been brutally assaulted, tased, and held in a restraint \nchair for an extended period of time. \n104.  On April 12, 2018, a Rikers detainee named Julian Cepeda filed an Article \n78 petition against DOC and Commissioner Brann, among others, challenging his transfer to the \nAlbany County Jail as a matter of state law.  In his petition, Mr. Cepeda alleged, among other \nthings, that on the day of his arrival at the Albany County Jail, he was โbrutally beaten and \nsexually assaulted, where an officer put on a latex glove and stuck his finger in Petitioner[โs] \nbuttocks.โ  Mr. Cepeda further alleged that he โmade [a] medical complaint about rectal bleeding \nand visible swollen area to medical staffโ but was denied medical attention. \n105.  On July 10, 2018, Plaintiff Espinalโs criminal defense counsel, Ruben \nFernandez of The Bronx Defenders, notified DOC Commissioner Brann and numerous other \nofficials in writing about the abuses and conditions that Mr. Espinal had been subjected to at \nAlbany County Jail.  The DOC general counselโs office responded by denying responsibility for \nMr. Espinalโs treatment while he is held at the Albany County Jail. \n(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)\n37   A Local Law to Amend the Administrative Code of the City of New York, in Relation to Requiring Notice \nand Review for Transferring Inmates to Facilities Outside New York City, supra note 25. \n24 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 29 of 101\n106.  On July 22, 2018, the New York Times published its lengthy story on the \ntreatment of Rikers detainees at the Albany County Jail.  The Times explained that detainees \nwere transferred out of New York City without notice and put in solitary confinement at the \nAlbany County Jail.  The Times reported on several detaineesโ allegations that they had been \nbeaten on arrival at the Albany County Jail.38  In response, Mayor de Blasio defended the Cityโs \npractice of sending young detainees to Albany to be put in solitary confinement. \n107.  On October 31, 2018, Mr. Cepeda, represented by attorney Robert \nQuackenbush of the Legal Aid Society Prisonersโ Rights Project, filed an amended Article 78 \npetition again alleging that he had been assaulted without provocation during the admission \nprocess at the Albany County Jail.  Mr. Cepeda further alleged that he was 20 years old and \nwould be held in solitary confinement in Albany until May 11, 2019. \n108.  On December 3, 2018, Plaintiff Tillery, represented by attorney \nQuackenbush, filed a similar Article 78 petition against DOC and Commissioner Brann \nchallenging his transfer to the Albany County Jail as a matter of state law.  He alleged, among \nother things, that he had been subject to excessive and unlawful force during the intake process \nat the Albany County Jail. \nVII.  Albany Countyโs Systemic Interference with Communications with Counsel \n(cid:3)\n109.  Because the Albany County Jail is 160 miles from New York City, it is \nnot feasible for Rikers detaineesโ criminal defense lawyers to pay regular visits to discuss the \ndetaineesโ pending criminal cases in New York City courts. \n(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)\n38   Southall & Ransom, supra note 28. \n25 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 30 of 101\n110.  As a result, it is critical that Rikers detainees and their criminal defense \nattorneys be permitted to hold confidential telephone calls or confidential videoconferences.  \nSuch consultation is necessary for the Rikers detainees to participate in and direct their defense \nof the criminal charges against them. \n111.  State law governing county jails requires that โall prisoners shall have \naccess to legal counsel,โ including โtelephone communications.โ  It further provides that \nโtelephone communications between prisoners and their legal counsel shall not be monitored \nexcept visually.โ39 \n112.  However, there is no such thing as a confidential, unrecorded legal \ntelephone call to or from the Albany County Jail. \n113.  Detainees in solitary confinement at the Albany County Jail are generally \nnot permitted to use the telephone at all. \n114.  The Albany County Jail will arrange for detainees in solitary confinement \nto speak with their attorneys under exigent circumstances.  But those calls are monitored by jail \nstaff. \n115.  Albany County Jail officials have repeatedly represented, including to the \nLegal Aid Society Prisonersโ Rights Project, that all detainee calls to or from the Albany County \nJailโeven with counselโare monitored. \n116.  In a letter dated August 6, 2018, Chief Deputy Sheriff William Rice stated \nthat Albany County has โno policies or directive[s] addressing confidential telephone \ncommunications between incarcerated persons [and] counsel.โ \n(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)\n39   9 NYCRR ยงยง 7031.2(a), (b). \n26 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 31 of 101\n117.  Albany County Jail correction officers have made comments to Plaintiffs \nEspinal and Tillery about the details of Espinal and Tilleryโs private conversations with their \nattorneys.  Plaintiffs Espinal and Tillery did not voluntarily disclose those details to their jailors.  \nThe only way the correction officers could have learned those details was by listening to the \nconversations without Plaintiffs Espinal and Tilleryโs consent.  \nVIII.  The Experiences of the Named Plaintiffs \n(cid:3)\n118.  Plaintiffsโ experiences are emblematic of the punitive and arbitrary nature \nof SJO transfers off Rikers Island and the routinized torture, sexual assault, deliberate \nindifference to serious medical needs, and unlawful solitary confinement that New York City \ndetainees experience in Albany County. \nDavon Washington \nA.  Davon Washington is Detained at Rikers Island Starting in March 2016 \n(cid:3)\n119.  Davon Washington is a 21-year-old African American young man. \n120.  Davon was diagnosed as a child with depression.  He spent time in his \nchildhood in a group home and in foster care.   \n121.  At the age of 19, Davon was arrested and taken into custody by the New \nYork City DOC. \n122.  Davon arrived at Rikers Island on or around March 24, 2016. \n123.  While at Rikers Island, Davon received mental health services, including \ncounseling and medication for attention deficit disorder.  He also received educational services in \nsupport of his efforts to obtain a GED, and he attended high school at the Island Academy. \n27 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 32 of 101\nB.  The March 28, 2018 Transfer of Davon Washington from Rikers to the  \nAlbany County Jail \n \n124.  While at Rikers Island, in or about March 2018, Davon lodged complaints \nwith the Legal Aid Society Prisonersโ Rights Project, alleging, among other things, that he was \ngroped by a DOC staff member and denied adequate mental health and medical care. \n125.  On information and belief, Legal Aid representatives contacted DOC \nabout Davonโs complaints on or about March 16, 2018 and March 26, 2018. \n126.  On or about March 22, 2018, DOC ESU officers woke Davon up in the \nearly morning and ordered him to โpack up.โ  Davon complied, and he was removed from his \ncell for the day.  However, he was returned the same cell at the end of the day. \n127.  On March 28, 2018, ESU officers woke Davon up in the early morning \nand again ordered him to pack up. \n128.  The ESU officers told Davon, in apparent reference to a deputy warden at \nthe jail where Davon was housed, that Deputy Walker โcanโt be around you.โ \n129.  The ESU officers strip-searched Devon, placed him in the BOSS Chair, \nand put him through a metal detector. \n130.  When Davon asked where he was going, ESU responded, โOff Rikers.โ  \nESU told him, in an apparent reference to Defendant Walker: โYouโre going to Albany because \nDeputy Walker donโt want you.โ \n131.  ESU placed Davon in a transport van with one other detainee. \n132.  Prior to being removed from Rikers, Davon was given no written \nnotification for the basis of the transfer, received no hearing, and was not permitted to call his \n28 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 33 of 101\nfamily or lawyers to inform anyone of his whereabouts.  He was not even told he was going to be \ntransferred. \n133.  Defendant Williams obtained the SJO transferring Davon to Albany \nCounty. \n134.  The Substitute Jail Order issued by the SCOC is dated March 22, 2018.  It \nstates that DOC, โas a result of safety considerations,โ is โunfit for the confinement of Devon \n[sic] Washington.โ \n135.  ESU officers drove Davon and the other detainee in the van for several \nhours.   \n136.  When Davon exited the van, he saw a squad of approximately 12 law \nenforcement officers standing in front of him, wearing green fatigues and riot gear, including \nhelmets and body armor.  Davon would later learn that these were correction officers from the \nAlbany County Jail.   \n137.  Several green-suited officers grabbed Davon and took him to the Intake \narea of the Albany County Jail.  Approximately two to three ESU officers also entered the \nAlbany County Jail escorting Davon. \n138.  The ESU officers removed Davonโs Rikers cuffs and restraints, and he \nwas placed in Albany County Jail cuffs and shackles. \n139.  Davon followed all orders given to him and was cooperative during this \nprocedure. \n29 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 34 of 101\nC.  Defendants Physically and Sexually Assault Davon Washington at the \nAlbany County Jail   \n(cid:3)\n140.  Several Albany County Jail correction officers then moved Davon into a \nsmall room, Booking Cell #2. \n141.  Approximately eight to ten Albany County Jail correction officers and \nsupervisors, including Defendants Torrisi, Valvo, โSuperman,โ Lawson, Haley, LaBombard, \nAnzalone, and Shield #323, were waiting for him in the room. \n142.  Defendant Torrisi told Davon to put his head on the wall.  Davon \ncomplied.   \n143.  Defendant Torrisi asked Davon, in sum and substance: โWhat are you \ndoing here?โ  When Davon stated โI donโt know,โ Defendant Torrisi smacked Davon in the face \nwith his open hand. \n144.  Defendant Torrisi then stated, โWhoโs the biggest gang?โ, in an apparent \nreference to alleged gang affiliation, and again smacked Davon in the face several times with an \nopen hand. \n145.  Defendant Torrisi stated to Davon, in sum and substance: โWeโre going to \ngive you instructions, follow them correctly.  Once we take these cuffs off, you better start \nswinging.โ \n146.  Defendants then removed Davonโs handcuffs and began to punch Davon \nall over his body. \n147.  On information and belief, the ESU officers were still in the intake area of \nthe Albany County Jail and were aware of what was happening. \n148.  Davon fell to the ground and curled up in the fetal position. \n30 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 35 of 101\n149.  Defendants either kicked and stomped on Davon or simply stood by and \ndid nothing to intervene while Davon lay on the ground and was beaten. \n150.  Defendant Torrisi stated: โWake him up.  I want him to feel everything.  \nHe likes to assault officers.โ \n151.  Four defendants then lifted Davon up and placed him face-first against the \nwall.  They then instructed Davon to take his left shoe off with his right hand and pass it over his \nright shoulder.  They then continued to give him other instructions to undress in a specific way.   \n152.  Davon was nervous and found it hard to comply with the instructions \nregarding his right and left hands.  Every time he made a mistake, such as by using his left hand \ninstead of his right hand, one of the Defendants would punch him. \n153.  When Davon was naked, Defendants asked: โWeโre gonna ask you once: \ndo you have anything you are not supposed to have?โ \n154.  Anticipating that he might go through a metal detector, Davon told \nDefendants that he had a bullet fragment in his foot.  In response, Defendants stomped directly \non Davonโs foot, causing him extreme pain. \n155.  Defendants then instructed Davon to spread his buttocks and cough. \nDavon complied.  \n156.  Defendants stated, โI see plastic,โ referring to an alleged item of \ncontraband in Davonโs rectum, and continued to beat Davon while he was naked. \n157.  Defendants then pushed Davon to the floor.  One of the Defendants \nforcefully inserted two fingers into Davonโs rectum.  Defendants then stated, in reference to the \nsupposed contraband: โHe pushed it back up.โ \n31 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 36 of 101\n158.  Defendants removed Davon from the cell, placed him in the BOSS chair, \nand put him through the metal detector to search for contraband.  Davon complied with all \ninstructions.  There was no indication that he was in possession of any contraband. \n159.  Davon was bleeding from his nose and mouth.  Defendants shouted at him \nto stop bleeding onto the BOSS chair. \n160.  Defendants ordered Davon to submit to a medical x-ray to search for \ncontraband.  Davon complied.   \n161.  Defendant Mylroie asked Davon if he had any injuries and he responded \nthat he did.  Defendants Lawson and โSuperman,โ who were standing nearby, then punched \nDavon in the face, stating โAsk him again, any injuries?โ  Davon then stated โNo.โ \n162.  Defendants escorted Davon to Cell #19 in the SHU located in 4 East \nHousing Unit. \n163.  Defendants ordered Davon to undress until he was naked.  Davon \ncomplied.  \n164.  Defendants Torrisi, Lawson, and a correction officer with spiky hair \npunched and kicked Davon multiple times while he was handcuffed and shackled in Cell #19. \n165.  Defendant Mylroie came to his cell at one point and asked if he wanted \nmedical attention.  Davon had blood all over his face and was visibly injured.  Davon was scared \nand told her that he didnโt need medical attention. \n166.  Later in the day, Major Brian Mooney came to Davonโs cell and stated to \nhim, in sum and substance: โDonโt mess around.  This is not Rikers.โ  \n32 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 37 of 101\n167.  As a result of the beating, Davon was bleeding, his face was swollen, his \ntooth was chipped, his lip was split, his foot was hurting, and he was bruised all over his back \nand body.  He was in pain for many days after the assault. \n168.  The Albany County Jail reports concerning the assault against Davon \nfalsely claim that he turned around and attacked staff members inside the booking cell: \nAt 1:17 p.m. Team 1 removed Inmate Washington from the Rikers \ntransport.  Inmate was brought into booking for processing.  Inmate \nwas escorted to Booking 2 Cell and read into SHU.  When officer \nremoved the handcuffs from inmate, inmate turned around and \nstarted punching at officers.  Inmate was brought to the floor and \nrestrained with body holds.  Inmate was placed back on the wall and \nthe strip search was completed. \n \n169.  Davon received an infraction ticket for the incident on or about March 28, \n2018, which falsely accused him of โlungingโ at staff and attempting to punch them when his \nhandcuffs were removed. \n170.  Davon appeared at the disciplinary hearing on April 8, 2018. \n171.  Davon did not testify at the hearing because he feared further retaliation \nand violence.  According to the facility Inmate Disciplinary Report, his only statement at the \nhearing was that he had nothing to say about the incident. \n172.  At the end of a hearing, Davon was sentenced to 360 days of punitive \nsegregationโan extraordinarily long periodโ by the hearing officer, Defendant Grimes. \n173.  Since the assault, Davon has continued to experience pain, emotional \ndistress, and traumatic thoughts. \n33 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 38 of 101\nD.  Davon Washington Is Held in Solitary Confinement at the Albany County \nJail For Nine Months \n(cid:3)\n174.  From his arrival at the Albany County Jail on March 28, 2018 until his \ndeparture in or around December 2018, with the exception of court visits, Davon was kept in a \nsmall solitary cell for at least 23 hours a day. \n175.  Davon had nothing to do in his cell: no meaningful human interaction, no \neducation or programming, no music or television, and limited reading materials. He had limited \naccess to phone calls, was not permitted to talk to other detainees, and did not leave his cell \nexcept to shower three times a week. \n176.     Davon was permitted to spend one hour a day out of his cell in a metal \ncage placed in the hallway outside his cell.  The metal cage is placed next to a window.  It is an \nempty, chain-link cage with nothing in it. \n177.  Davon was issued a number of disciplinary infractions for talking and \nโyelling,โ when he attempted to speak with the other detainees housed in the SHU.  One of these \ntickets resulted in him losing his commissary and phone privileges for 60 days. \n178.  If the young detainees in 4 East try to speak with each other, the SHU \nofficers turn on two large fans that make it both loud and extremely cold in the unit. \n179.  Defendants denied Davon access to educational programming and \nmaterials.  Davon filed grievances about this educational denial. \n180.  Davon was placed on psychiatric medication at Albany, including a \nmedicine he had not previously required. \n181.  Davon also lost a substantial amount of weightโapproximately 18 \npoundsโwhile at the Albany County Jail.  When he arrived, he weighed 155 pounds, and as of \n34 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 39 of 101\nOctober 5, 2018, he was down to 137 pounds.  The food portions were small and Davon was \nconstantly hungry, particularly at night.  He was placed on Ensure and vitamins in an attempt to \ncounteract the weight loss from inadequate nutrition. \n182.  While at the Albany County Jail, Davon had no visits from his family \nbecause it was too far for them to travel.  However, at Rikers, his mother, sisters, brother, and \nother family members were able to visit him. \nE.  Albany County Jail Guards Beat Davon Washington in Retaliation for a \nLegal Visit on October 5, 2018 \n \n183.  On October 5, 2018, Davon had a legal visit in the Albany County Jail \nwith his counsel in this action. \n184.  When the legal visit ended, multiple correction officers escorted Davon \nout of the visiting area. \n185.  One of them was an individual who was also involved in the initial March \n28, 2018 assault on Davon. \n186.  After the visit, the officers did not take Davon to the search area, as is \nstandard protocol. \n187.  Instead, three officers took Davon directly back to his cell and pushed him \ninto the back corner of the cell.  There are no cameras inside the cell. \n188.  One of the officers then struck Davon in the face repeatedly on his face \nwith an open hand, switching between striking the left and right sides of his face. \n189.  He then stated, in sum and substance, referring to Davonโs legal visit: \nโWhat did you think, that was going to stop us?โ and โWhat youโre doing is not going to work.โ \n190.  The officers took Davonโs legal paperwork from him.  \n35 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 40 of 101\nSteven Espinal \nA.  Steven Espinal Is Detained at Rikers Island Starting on November 18, 2017 \n(cid:3)\n191.  Steven Espinal is a 19-year-old Latino teenager detained at the Albany \nCounty Jail, where he is currently in solitary confinement.   \n192.  Although he has criminal matters pending in the Bronx County Supreme \nCourt, Steven has no adult criminal convictions. \n193.  Steven was diagnosed as a teenager with bipolar disorder and attention-\ndeficit/hyperactivity disorder. \n194.  At the age of 18, Steven was arrested and put in the custody of the New \nYork City DOC. \n195.  He arrived at Rikers Island on November 18, 2017. \n196.  While at Rikers, Steven worked and received mental health services, \nincluding counseling, and educational services in support of his efforts to obtain a GED. \n197.  On February 10, 2018, Steven was detained at the George Motchan \nDetention Center (โGMDCโ). \n198.  On this date, he and other detainees, all of whom were under 21 at the \ntime, were allegedly involved in an altercation with a correction officer. \n199.  The correction officer was reported to have suffered a fracture to his spine. \n200.  The February 10, 2018 incident received widespread media coverage.  \nRepresentatives of the Correction Officers Benevolent Association (โCOBAโ) made public \nstatement blaming the incident on Mayor de Blasioโs policy of shielding detainees under 21 from \nsolitary confinement.  COBA blamed the inability to isolate detainees under 21 for an increase in \nattacks on correction officers. \n36 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 41 of 101\n201.  On February 10, 2018, DOC ESU officers brought Steven in a van from \nGMDC to a different building on Rikers Island to be fingerprinted and rearrested.  There, the \nESU officers hit Stevenโs head on a wall and smacked him in the face. \n202.  On February 11, 2018, Steven was transferred from GMDC to the Otis \nBantum Correctional Center (โOBCCโ), a different facility on Rikers. \n203.  On February 12, 2018, Steven was arraigned in Bronx Criminal Court and \ncharged with first-degree assault and other related counts stemming from the alleged February 10 \nincident. \nB.  The February 13, 2018 Transfer of Steven Espinal from Rikers to the Albany \nCounty Jail \n \n204.  On February 13, 2018, a captain woke Steven up in the early morning and \ntold him to get dressed because ESU was coming for him.  Steven asked where he was going.  \nThe captain said he would be coming right back. \n205.  ESU officers came for Steven and another young man who was allegedly \ninvolved in the February 10 incident and put them in a transport van. \n206.  After Steven was secured in the van, ESU officers drove to another \nlocation to pick up two more Rikers detainees who were also allegedly involved in the February \n10 incident. \n207.  Before being removed from Rikers, Steven was given no written \nnotification of the basis of his transfer, received no hearing, and was not permitted to call his \nfamily or lawyers to inform anyone of his whereabouts.  He was not even told that he was going \nto be transferred. \n37 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 42 of 101\n208.  ESU officers drove Steven and the other three detainees in the van for \nseveral hours.  Steven did not know where he was being taken. \n209.  At approximately 11:00am, the van door was opened. \n210.  Steven saw a squad of approximately 12 law enforcement officers \nstanding in front of him, wearing green fatigues and riot gear, including helmets and body armor.  \nSteven would later learn that these were correction officers from the Albany County Jail. \n211.  One of the green-suited officers said, โWe want Espinal first.โ \n212.  Several green-suited officers grabbed Steven and took him to the intake \narea of the Albany County Jail.  About two to three Rikers ESU officers also entered the Jail \nescorting Steven. \n213.  The Rikers ESU team removed Stevenโs DOC handcuffs. \n214.  One of the Albany County Jail officers took his photograph. \n215.  Several Albany County Jail officers them re-handcuffed Steven in Albany \nCounty Jail cuffs and shackled him. \n216.  Steven followed all orders given to him and was cooperative throughout \nthis process. \n217.  That same day, Stevenโs criminal defense attorney, Ruben Fernandez, \nattempted to contact Steven at Rikers by videoconference but was told by DOC staff that Steven \nhad been transferred from one Rikers Island facility to another.  Stevenโs attorney was unable to \ncontact Steven and did not know his location. \n218.  DOC has represented in an August 15, 2018 letter to Stevenโs criminal \ndefense counsel that it transferred Steven to the Albany County Jail on an emergency basis due \nto โextraordinary circumstancesโ under 9 NYCRR ยง 7210.6(e). \n38 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 43 of 101\n219.  However, on information and belief, no written correspondence between \nthe City and the State Commissioner exists, as required by law to authorize such a transfer.40 \n220.  On March 28, 2018โa month and a half after Steven arrived in the \nAlbany County JailโSCOC issued an SJO on the basis that โthe NYC Department of Correction \nis, as a result of safety considerations, unfit for the confinement of STEVEN ESPINA [sic].โ \n221.  Defendant Williams obtained the SJO transferring Steven to Albany \nCounty. \nC.  Defendants Physically and Sexually Assault Steven Espinal at the Albany \nCounty Jail \n \n222.  After Steven was cuffed and shackled, several Albany County Jail \ncorrection officers moved him into Booking Cell #2. \n223.  About eight to ten Albany County Jail correction officers and supervisors \nwere waiting for him there.  Defendants Torrisi, Harris, Beliveau, Adams, Kelly, Jarosz, Lawson, \nand Ton were present. \n224.  Defendant Torrisi stated to Steven, in sum and substance: โThis isnโt \nRikers.  This is Albany County.  We do what we want.โ \n225.  Defendant Torrisi then punched Steven in the face two times. \n226.  Defendant Torrisi then said to Steven, in sum and substance, โOnce we \ntake these cuffs off, you better start swinging.โ \n227.  Defendants began the process of removing Stevenโs handcuffs but did not \nactually remove them.  They began punching Steven all over his body. \n(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)\n40   See supra ยถ 56. \n39 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 44 of 101\n228.  Steven fell to the ground and curled up in the fetal position. \n229.  Defendants kicked and stomped on Steven while he lay on the ground \nand/or stood by and did nothing to intervene. \n230.  Defendant Torrisi then stated to the other officers, โThatโs enough.  Letโs \nget him up, boys.โ \n231.  The officers picked Steven up.  Defendant Torrisi told Steven to face the \nwall and said, in sum and substance, โAs soon as I take the cuffs off, put your hands high up on \nthe wall.โ  Steven complied. \n232.  Defendants gave Steven a series of detailed instructions about how to \nremove his clothing.  Steven did his best to comply.  When he was unable to do so, Defendants \npunched him in the ribs. \n233.  Once his clothing was removed, Defendants provided Steven with an \nAlbany County Jail jumpsuit, which he put on. \n234.  In total, the assault on Steven in the intake area lasted for several minutes. \n235.  Defendants then brought Steven to the BOSS chair and instructed him to \npass through a metal detector to search for contraband.   \n236.  Defendants then brought Steven to an x-ray room and ordered him to \nsubmit to a medical x-ray to search for contraband.   \n237.  Defendants said that the x-ray had detected that Steven had a weapon in \nhis body. \n238.  Defendants then brought Steven to the 4 East housing unit. \n239.  He was taken to a nurse at the back of the housing unit, who said that he \nwas fine. \n40 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 45 of 101\n240.  Defendants then escorted Steven to Cell #3 in 4 East. \n241.  Defendants ordered Steven to remove his jumper in the cell and pass it \nback to them.  Steven complied. \n242.  Defendants then punched and kicked Steven multiple times.  An officer \nsaid, in sum and substance, โWeโre going to get that out of you,โ referring to the alleged \ncontraband. \n243.  When Steven was on the floor, an officer put on gloves.  Defendant \nLawson held Stevenโs arms down.  The gloved officer forcefully inserted his fingers into \nStevenโs rectum. \n244.  The officer who had inserted his fingers into Stevenโs rectum said he \ncould not feel anything.  Other officers said, in sum and substance, โHe knows what heโs doing.  \nHeโs moving it up.โ \n245.  Steven was bleeding from his rectum and in great pain. \n246.  Defendants then told Steven to defecate on the floor and threatened to beat \nthe alleged contraband out of his body if he failed to do so.  Defendants continued to assault \nSteven while he was lying naked on the floor. \n247.  The officers then ordered Steven to stand up. \n248.  One of the officers said, in sum and substance, โWeโre going to make you \nsh*t it out.โ \n249.  While Steven was standing against the wall, Defendant Beliveau used a \ntaser against him.  \n41 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 46 of 101\n250.  Steven was standing with his back to the officers when he was tased from \na few feet away.  He did not know what was happening.  He felt extreme pain and felt unable to \nmove.  He fell to the ground. \n251.  The assault on Steven in Cell #3 lasted for several minutes in total. \n252.  After the assault, Steven was taken to the shower.  He was then brought to \nthe restraint chair. \n253.  The restraint chair is a physical restraint device that allows correction \nofficers to fasten a detainee to a chair at the wrists, ankles, thighs, arms, and head. \n254.  While Steven was in the restraint chair, officers slapped and smacked him \nthe face.  They asked him, in sum and substance, โHow does it feel not to be able to defend \nyourself?โ \n255.  Steven was held in the restraint chair overnight.  While in the chair, he \npassed out from pain and fatigue. \n256.  On the morning of February 14, 2018, Steven woke up in the restraint \nchair.  Officers then brought him to the medical area. \n257.  As a result of the beating, Steven was bleeding, was bruised all over his \nbody, and was dizzy and dazed.  He was unable to urinate normally and saw blood in his urine.  \nHe could not hear out of one of his ears. \n258.  On February 14, 2018, Steven was taken to Albany Medical Center, where \nhe was catheterized because he was unable to urinate normally. \n259.  In the intake area on the way to or from the hospital, Steven encountered \nDefendant Superintendent Lyons, who observed Stevenโs physical condition. \n42 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 47 of 101\n260.  Steven feared retaliation from Defendants if he reported that that Albany \nCounty Jail guards had assaulted him while these guards listened to his report. He told medical \nstaff that he had lost consciousness the day before in a โfight.โ   \n261.  Albany Medical Center staff documented scratches to his face, tenderness \nto his neck, subrapubic tenderness, โmultiple bruises and abrasions on the bilateral upper \nextremities,โ and โmidline C spine tendernessโ requiring a collar and CT scan of the head and \nneck. \n262.  After his return from Albany Medical Center, Steven was sent back to \nsolitary confinement in Cell #3 on 4 East. \n263.  On February 16, 2018, Steven was transported to the Bronx for another in-\nperson court appearance in the Bronx.  The judge ordered that Steven be given immediate \nmedical attention. \n264.  The Albany County Jail reports about the assault against Steven claim that \nhe repeatedly โturned off the wallโ to assault multiple staff members in riot gear while locked in \na confined space: \n[W]hile conducting a CERT operation in Booking processing new \nRikerโs [sic] Island Inmate Boarders, Inmate Espinal did not comply \nwith staff orders during a strip search by turning off the wall towards \nstaff & threatened to cut them.  He was taken to the floor & \nrestrained by staff until he was brought under control.  After we \ncompleted the Booking process, he was taken to the X-ray room, \nwhere an X-ray was taken & showed positive for two objects in his \nrectum.  He was then taken to SHU . . . .   During his apparent \nattempt to remove the items, while covered in his own feces, after \nbeing given several direct orders to remain facing the wall, inmate \nturned from the wall & lunged at staff.  \n \n \n43 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 48 of 101\nD.  Steven Espinal Remains in Solitary Confinement at the Albany County Jail, \nAfter More Than 10 Months There  \n(cid:3)\n265.  For two weeks, Defendants provided Steven with no notice of the basis for \nhis punitive detention in solitary confinement. \n266.  An infraction ticket dated February 13, 2018 that falsely accused Steven of \nassaulting staff was generated, but not served on Steven. \n267.  A disciplinary hearing was held on February 26, 2018, at which Steven \nappeared. \n268.  Prior to the hearing, a sergeant told Steven that โno matter what \nhappened,โ he would remain in punitive segregation for however long he was at the Albany \nCounty Jail, so he should just โadmit to everythingโ so that it can โgo easy.โ \n269.  Steven had no opportunity to prepare for the hearing and was not given an \nopportunity to identify or call witnesses. \n270.  The hearing officer, Defendant Sergeant Foe #17, sentenced Steven to an \nextraordinary 600 days in solitary confinement. \n271.  On April 10, 2018, Steven appeared on his Bronx criminal matter before \nJustice Armando Montano.  At that time, Justice Montano directed Stevenโs release from \npunitive segregation. \n272.  Steven remains in solitary confinement, where he has been continuously \nsince February 13, 2018, in violation of a court order. \n273.  Steven has been kept in a small solitary cell for at least 23 hours a day.  \nSteven has nothing to do in his cell: no meaningful human interaction, no education or \nprogramming, no music or television, and limited reading materials. \n44 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 49 of 101\n274.  He has limited access to phone calls, is not permitted to talk to other \ndetainees, and other than access to showers three times a week, he is not permitted to leave his \ncell.    \n275.  Steven usually declines to spend his one hour a day of โrecreationโ in the \ncage outside his cell because it is not materially different from staying in his cell. \n276.  Steven does not have a high school diploma and has been denied access to \neducational services since February 12, 2018.  He has informed DOC and its Institutional Service \nUnit both verbally and in writing that he wishes to participate in educational services.  He \nreceived on educational packet in September 2018 but no other materials.  Steven was told by \ncorrections officers that he would receive no schooling while in the Albany County Jail. \n277.  Steven is permitted visitors one hour a week on Tuesdays from 3:30-4:30. \nBecause the Albany County Jail is such long a distance from his motherโs house in Pennsylvania, \nshe is unable to visit. \n278.  Steven is only permitted to access mental health services in his cell, when \na counselor will come to his cell and speak with him in the presence of a correction officer \nwithout privacy or confidentiality. \n279.  Steven has not received sufficient access to his criminal defense counsel \nsince February 13, 2018.  Orders to have Steven produced in court for attorney visits have gone \nunheeded.  On March 26, 2018, Justice Margaret Clancy signed an order to have Steven \nproduced to speak to his attorneys on April 4, 2018.  On April 27, 2018, Justice Shari Michels \nsigned an order to have Steven produced on May 1, 2018โa date on which other Rikers \ndetainees housed at the Albany County Jail were to be brought to court.  Both orders were \ntransmitted to the New York City DOCโand both orders went ignored. \n45 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 50 of 101\n280.  On March 2, 2018, and March 13, 2018, Steven was scheduled to appear \nin Bronx Supreme Court Criminal Term.  Courts in New York City were open, and detainees \nhoused in detention centers closer to the Bronx courthouses were produced for their appearances.  \nBut Steven was not produced for his scheduled court appearances because of inclement weather. \n281.  Since the assault, Steven has continued to experience pain, emotional \ndistress, and traumatic thoughts.  He still has difficulty urinating normally and sometimes needs \nto be catheterized to have urine removed from his bladder. \nE.  Defendants Brutally Assault Steven Espinal Again on July 4, 2018 \n(cid:3)\n282.  On the morning of July 4, 2018, a nurse was making medical rounds in 4 \nEast at the Albany County Jail. \n283.  Steven was in Cell #11.  He was sleeping and did not hear the nurseโs \nquestions.  As a result, he did not respond. \n284.  Steven sometimes has difficulty waking up because he takes psychiatric \nmedication that makes him tired. \n285.  When Steven did not respond to the nurseโs questions, several correction \nofficers entered his cell. \n286.  They pinned him to the bed, handcuffed him, and shackled him. \n287.  The officers then beat Steven for failing to respond to the nurse. \n288.  The officers grabbed Stevenโs hair and sprayed him in the face with \npepper spray at close range. \n289.  The officers kicked, punched, and elbowed Steven while he was \nhandcuffed and shackled. \n46 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 51 of 101\n290.  After the assault, Steven had difficult opening his jaw, which was swollen \nand very painful. \n291.  Steven also had a deep cut over his left temple. \n292.  He had pain in his chest, neck, and back. \n293.  Steven was taken to Albany Medical Center.  Upon arrival at the hospital, \nSteven was unable to open his jaw. \n294.  Doctors noted an abrasion to the top of Stevenโs left shoulder, as well as \nโ[h]ead traumaโ and โ[l]eft jaw pain and swelling post assault.โ   \n295.  Steven was given a CT scan of the head, neck, and cervical spine, which \nrevealed no fractures.  The doctor found โasymmetrical soft tissue edema and contusion along \nthe lateral aspect of the left mandible.โ \n296.  A doctor also observed a laceration on the left side of Stevenโs face. \n297.  The medical diagnosis given to Steven by Albany Medical Center was \nโassault.โ \nF.  Notices of Claim \n(cid:3)\n298.  Within ninety days after the February 13, 2018, assault upon Steven, \nwritten Notices of Claim, sworn by Steven, were served upon the City of New York at the \nComptrollerโs Office at 1 Centre Street, New York, New York and upon the County of Albany at \n112 State Street, Albany, New York. \n299.

On or about January 16, 2018, Doe was housed in unit 9 South at the \nManhattan Detention Complex (โMDCโ), in Lower Manhattan. \n307.  Defendant Sullivan came to see Doe in 9 South on or about January 16, \n2018. \n308.  Doe was in the cage outside his cell when Defendant Sullivan came. \n48 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 53 of 101\n309.  Defendant Sullivan asked Doe, in sum and substance, โWhy are you not \nlocked in?  Typical.โ \n310.  Doe responded that he did not know he was supposed to lock into his cell. \n311.  Defendant Sullivan said, in sum and substance, โThatโs OK.  Soon enough \nwe wonโt have to deal with your bullshit anymore.  Youโre going somewhere good, somewhere \nthat youโll like.โ \n312.  Doe did not know what Defendant Sullivan was talking about. \n313.  On January 17, 2018, Doe was transferred, along with other detainees, to \nthe Ulster County Jail on a substitute jail order. \n314.  Doe did not receive notice that he was going to be transferred out of New \nYork City in advance. \n315.  Doe did not know he was going to Ulster County until he got there. \nC.  John Doe Is Transferred from Ulster County to the Albany County Jail \n(cid:3)\n316.  Doe and the other Rikers detainees spent only about a week at the Ulster \nCounty Correctional Facility. \n317.  On or about January 24, 2018, Doe was transferred to the Albany County \nJail. \n318.  Doe arrived at the Albany County Jail at around 10:00 or 11:00 am on the \ndate of his transfer. \n319.  Doe was transported from Ulster to the Albany County Jail by New York \nCity DOC ESU officers. \n49 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 54 of 101\n320.  When the door opened, Doe was met by the Green Team, dressed in riot \ngear and green vests. \n321.  Defendant Torrisi was in command of the Green Team. \nD.  Defendants Brutalize and Sexually Assault John Doe \n(cid:3)\n322.  The Green Team escorted Doe to a booking cell in which he was subjected \nto a strip search. \n323.  During the search process, Defendants gave bizarrely detailed and \nconfusing instructions about the manner and sequence in which Doe should remove his clothing. \n324.  As Doe tried to carry out the instructions, Defendants began to hit and \nkick him, claiming that Doe was carrying out their instructions improperly. \n325.  After knocking Doe to the ground, Defendants picked him back up and \ntold him to do a better job of listening to their instructions. \n326.  Defendants then brought Doe to the BOSS Chair, which did not indicate \nthe existence of any contraband in Doeโs body. \n327.  From the BOSS Chair, Defendants brought Doe to a room with an x-ray \ntable. \n328.  Defendants forcibly placed Doe on the x-ray table and held him down so \nthat he could be x-rayed. \n329.  Defendants said that the x-ray detected the presence of a razor secreted in \nDoeโs rectum. \n330.  In the x-ray room, Defendant Torrisi slapped Doe twice and said, in sum \nand substance, โGive me the weapon now, or this will be the worst day of your life.โ \n50 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 55 of 101\n331.  Another correction officer hit Doe one time in the x-ray room. \n332.  From the x-ray room, Defendants took Doe to Cell #11 in 4 East. \n333.  Doe was naked in Cell #11 with eight to ten correction officers, including \nDefendants Poole, Kelly, Reddy, Lawson, Anzalone, Jarosz, and Frank Harris. \n334.  In Cell #11, Defendants told Doe, in sum and substance, to remove the \nrazor they claimed to have seen in his body or they would kill him. \n335.  Defendants removed Doeโs handcuffs. \n336.  Six to eight correction officers, including Defendant Torrisi, then began to \nassault Doe with their fists and batons. \n337.  During the assault, Defendants kept telling Doe to remove the blade from \nhis rectum. \n338.  At one point, a correction officer sprayed Doe in the face at close range \nwith pepper spray. \n339.  During the beating, a correction officer told Doe, in sum and substance: \nโWe kill people here.  Is that what you want?โ \n340.  During the events in Cell #11, Doe informed Defendants that he had a \nbullet in his right leg from being shot on a previous occasion. \n341.  In response, one of the correction officers began to stomp on Doeโs right \nleg in an effort to cause him further pain. \n342.  At a certain point during the beating in Cell #11, Defendant Torrisi told \nDoe, referring to the alleged contraband in his rectum: โEither you give it to us, or we go in and \nget it.โ \n343.  Doe responded by asking for food and water to stimulate his bowels. \n51 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 56 of 101\n344.  In response, Defendant Torrisi slammed Doeโs head against the wall and \ncaused Doe to bend over. \n345.  Defendant Torrisi instructed a correction officer to put a baton in Doeโs \nrectum. \n346.  The officer jammed a baton into Doeโs rectum and repeatedly pushed it in \nand out. \n347.  When the officer removed the baton from Doeโs rectum, Doe saw blood \non the baton. \n348.  Defendant Torrisi asked Doe whether he had ever felt 50,000 volts course \nthrough his body. \n349.  At that point, an officer used a taser against Doe. \n350.  Doe involuntarily urinated on himself. \n351.  The taser wires remained attached to Doe. \n352.  Defendant Torrisi said, in sum and substance: โWeโre going to kill you.  \nThis isnโt Rikers anymore.โ \n353.  Defendants tased Doe a second time. \n354.  Doe involuntarily defecated on himself. \n355.  While Doe was lying on the ground in his own urine and feces, a \ncorrection officer inserted his finger into Doeโs rectum. \n356.  Defendants then tased Doe a third time, at which point Doe involuntarily \ndefecated on himself again. \n357.  A correction officer disconnected the wires of the taser from Doeโs body. \n52 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 57 of 101\n358.  Defendants then shot Doe again with a different Taser.  Again he \ninvoluntarily defecated on himself. \n359.  At that point, Defendants told Doe that the weapon was no longer in his \nrectum. \n360.  After Doe was tased for the last time, one of the correction officers hit him \nand said, in sum and substance, โThatโs for getting your sh*t on my shoes, you f*cking animal.โ \n361.  Doe lost consciousness multiple times during the beating. \nE.  Doe Is Denied Medical Attention and Made to Sleep in His Own Bodily \nWaste \n \n362.  After the beating in Cell #11, Defendants brought Doe back to the x-ray \nroom to be x-rayed a second time. \n363.  Doe asked for medical attention from the person in the x-ray room who \nappeared to be a medical professional, but his request was refused. \n364.  After the second x-ray, Defendants provided Doe with a jail jumper but \ndenied him the opportunity to clean himself and did not decontaminate him from the pepper \nspray they used against him. \n365.  Doe was taken to Cell #14 in 4 East. \n366.  That night, Doe was forced to sleep with the remnants of his own urine \nand feces stuck to his body. \n367.  The next morning, on January 25, 2018, Doe again requested medical \nattention. \n368.  Doe had an open wound on his forehead and two black eyes, and his left \neye was swollen shut. \n53 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 58 of 101\n369.  Doeโs face was bruised and swollen, and his ribs and chest were bruised. \n370.  Doeโs rectum was damaged and bled for weeks after the incident. \n371.  Defendant Mylroie denied Doe medical attention and told him to take \nMotrin. \n372.  Doe was not examined by a physician until approximately a week after the \nbeating that occurred on January 24, 2018. \n373.  The Albany County Jail reports concerning the January 24, 2018 assault \non Doe falsely state that Doe โturn[ed] off the wallโ to assault staff and โmoved toward staffโ in \nan aggressive manner: \nDuring  a  CERT  operation  processing  new  Rikerโs  [sic]  Island \nInmate Boarders, Inmate [Doe] was uncooperative during the initial \nstrip search in Booking by turning off the wall towards staff.  He \nwas taken to the floor & restrained by staff.  He was placed back on \nwall & the strip search was completed without further incident.  He \nwas then escorted to the X-ray room, where an X-ray was taken of \nhim, which was positive for contraband.  Inmate was then escorted \nto SHU Cell 11 . . . .  He was again taken to the floor & restrained \nafter he turned away from the wall & lunged at staff.  . . .  Capt. \nHarris relieved Sgt. Poole & gave Inmate [Doe] several direct orders \nto remove the item.  Capt. Harris applied two separate five second \ntaser cycles to inmate, when he did not comply with orders & moved \ntoward staff with his hands & arms covered in feces. \n \nF.  John Doe Is Placed in Solitary Confinement at the Albany County Jail \n(cid:3)\n374.  Doe was issued an infraction ticket on January 24, 2018 that charged him \nwith assaulting staff, among other offenses. \n375.  A disciplinary hearing was held on February 6, 2018. \n376.  At the hearing, Doe denied the charges and explained that he had been \nsubjected to an unlawful search and that his rights had been violated. \n54 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 59 of 101\n377.  In response, the hearing officer, Lieutenant Frank Foe #15, said, in sum \nand substance, โOK, you talk a good game, but we are still going to find you guilty regardless.โ \n378.  Lieutenant Foe #15 sentenced Plaintiff Doe to the extraordinary sum of \n550 days in solitary confinement. \n379.  Doe spent approximately the next ten months in solitary confinement \nwithout meaningful human contact. \n380.  Doe had previously spent time in solitary confinement at Rikers Island, \nbut the time in solitary in Albany was significantly more difficult because he had no outdoor \nrecreation, no visitors, limited phone access, and very little contact with other detainees. \n381.  During the time in his cell, Doe thought constantly about the assault that \nhappened on the day he arrived. \n382.  He was alone and felt terrified. \n383.  Doe became paranoid that the correction officers at the Albany County \nJail were tampering with his food. \n384.  Doe usually chose not to take his one daily hour of โrecreationโ outside \nhis cell because it was functionally no different than staying in his cell. \nG.  Defendants Attempt to Intimidate John Doe \n(cid:3)\n385.  On or about January 26, 2018, Torrisi came to Doeโs cell prior to a legal \nvisit that Doe received from an attorney. \n386.  Defendant Torrisi told Doe, in sum and substance, โIf you snitch on us, we \nwill come up here at four in the morning and put you in a body bag.  We will kill you.  We do \nthat up here.โ \n55 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 60 of 101\n387.  Torrisi asked Doe if he was a gang member. \n388.  When Doe said no, Torrisi punched him in the face and called him a liar. \n389.  On or about March 18, 2018, Defendant Torrisi again punched Doe in the \nface in retaliation for Doeโs complaints about having been sexually assaulted. \n390.  Since the assault on January 24, 2018, Doe has continued to experience \npain, emotional distress, and traumatic thoughts.  He frequently thinks about the assault, and \nruminates about it. \n391.  While he was detained at the Albany County Jail, John Doe was terrified \nas a result of the assault.  He was afraid to eat because he became scared that guards were \npoisoning his food.  \n392.  On October 29, 2018, Doe pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a \ncontrolled substance in the third degree. \n393.  Doe is now serving his sentence in the custody of DOCCS. \n394.  Doe considered the plea offer to be a poor one with a long sentence, but he \nchose to accept it anyway so he could get out of the Albany County Jail and into a different \nfacility. \nPariis Tillery \nA.  Pariis Tillery Is Detained By DOC Starting on March 4, 2017 \n(cid:3)\n395.  Pariis Tillery is a 25-year-old African-American young man detained at \nthe Albany County Jail, where he is currently in solitary confinement. \n396.  Pariis received a GED and then completed two semesters at the New York \nCity College of Technology. \n56 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 61 of 101\n397.  Although he has criminal matters pending in the Brooklyn County \nSupreme Court, Pariis has no adult criminal convictions.  \n398.  On or about March 4, 2017, Pariis was arrested and placed in the custody \nof the New York City DOC. \n399.  Pariis was first detained at the Brooklyn Detention Center, where, on \nAugust 7, 2018, he was accused of assaulting a correction officer. \n400.  On August 8, 2018, Pariis was transferred to Rikers Island. \nB.  The August 9, 2018 Transfer of Pariis Tillery from Rikers to the Albany \nCounty Jail \n \n401.  On August 9, 2018, Defendants Brann and Williams obtained an SJO \ntransferring Pariis to Albany County. \n402.  On August 9, 2018, a DOC captain woke Pariis up in the early morning \nand told him to get dressed because ESU was coming for him.  Pariis asked where he was going \nbut was not given an answer.  \n403.  ESU officers came for Pariis and put him in a transport van. \n404.  Before being removed from Rikers, Pariis was given no written \nnotification of the basis of his transfer, received no hearing, and was not permitted to call his \nfamily or lawyers to inform anyone of his whereabouts.  He was not even told that he was going \nto be transferred. \n405.  ESU officers drove Pariis in the van for several hours.  He was the only \nperson in the van.  Pariis did not know where he was being taken.  He asked repeatedly where he \nwas going but no one would tell him.  \n57 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 62 of 101\n406.  When the van door opened, Pariis saw a squad of approximately 12 law \nenforcement officers standing in front of him, wearing green fatigues and riot gear, including \nhelmets and body armor.  Pariis would later learn that these were correction officers from the \nAlbany County Jail.  \n407.  Several green-suited officers grabbed Pariis and took him to the intake \narea of the Albany County Jail.  About two to three Rikers ESU officers who had brought Pariis \nfrom Rikers also entered the Jail. \n408.  Pariis followed all orders given to him and was cooperative throughout  \nthis process.  \n \nC.  Defendants Physically Assault Pariis Tillery at the Albany County Jail \n(cid:3)\n409.  After Pariis was cuffed and shackled, several Albany County Jail \ncorrection officers moved him into Booking Cell #2 and removed his handcuffs.  \n410.  About eight to ten Albany County Jail correction officers and supervisors \nwere waiting for him there.  Defendants Lawson, Shield #323, Shield #99, and Albany County \nCorrection Officers Frank Foes #19-21 were present.  \n411.  One Albany correction officer said to him: โDo the same thing you did on \nRikers Island.โ \n412.  Defendant Sergeant Foe #18 said to Pariis, โDo you know where you are \nat?โ  When Pariis said โno,โ Defendant Sergeant Foe #18 punched Pariis in the face.  Eight or \nnine correction officers then proceeded to beat Pariis about his face and body.   \n413.  Pariis began to bleed from his nose.  Defendants placed a โspit maskโ on \nhis face, though Pariis was not spitting at anyone. \n58 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 63 of 101\n414.  Defendant Lawson, Shield #323, Shield #99, and Albany County \nCorrection Officers Frank Foes #19-21 punched, kicked, and stomped on Pariis. \n415.   Pariis fell to the floor, where Defendants continued to kick and punch \nhim.  \n416.  After beating him for approximately 10 minutes, Defendants brought \nPariis to the BOSS chair and instructed him to pass through a metal detector to search for \ncontraband.  Pariis complied with all instructions.  The BOSS chair did not indicate the presence \nof contraband on Pariisโs person. \n417.  Defendants then stated to Pariis, in sum and substance: โDo you have \nsomething?  You Rikers guys are always lying.  If you do have something, weโre going to beat \nyou until you sh*t it out.โ  \n418.  Defendants then brought Pariis to an x-ray room and ordered him to \nsubmit to a medical x-ray to search for contraband.  Pariis complied.  \n419.  Defendants then escorted Pariis to Cell #14 in 4 East.  \n420.  Defendants instructed Pariis to remove his jumpsuit.  Pariis complied.  \n421.  Defendants then brandished a taser at Pariis.  \n422.  One Defendant stated to Pariis, โTake it out of your ass, you monkey.โ  \n423.  Defendants then hit, punched and kicked Pariis multiple times.  An officer \nsaid, in sum and substance, โWeโre going to get that out of you,โ referring to the alleged \ncontraband.  \n424.  The assault on Pariis in Cell #14 lasted for a significant period of time.  \n425.  Pariis was taken back for another x-ray and then returned to his cell.  \n59 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 64 of 101\n426.  Defendant Mylroie came to his cell and observed his bleeding nose and \nother visible injuries and told him he was fine.  \n427.  Pariis was in extreme pain after the assault and passed out.  He could not \nhear out of his left ear and his head hurt.  His nose was swollen, and he had two black eyes, \ndizziness, and bruises over much of his body. \n428.  Pariis told correction officers that his head hurt and that he could not hear \nfrom his left ear.  He requested medical attention on August 10, 2018. \n429.  Four days after he was assaulted, on August 13, 2018, Pariis was finally \ntaken for treatment of the serious injuries he suffered during the August 9 assault.   \n430.  Despite the presence of correction officers with him at the hospital, Pariis \ntold the medical personnel that he had been assaulted by correction officers at Albany County \nJail. \n431.  Albany County Jail medical records dated August 13, 2018, document that \nhe had โTrauma to Headโ and โBlood in Ear,โ as well as โecchymosis to orbits.โ  The Albany \nCounty Jail records request that the outside medical provider rule out โskull fractureโ and \nโcranial trauma.โ \n432.  At the emergency room of Albany Memorial Hospital, Pariis was \ndiagnosed with tympanic membrane perforation, head injury, and a concussion.  He was \nprescribed and antibiotic and given multiple CT scans for possible fractures in his skull, face, or \nbody. \n433.  Tympanic membrane perforation, or a ruptured eardrum, is a hole in the \neardrum.  It is an injury commonly caused by severe trauma to the head. \n60 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 65 of 101\n434.  The Manual on Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and \nOther Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (2004), commonly known as the \nIstanbul Protocol, is the authoritative United Nations document which sets forth international \nguidelines on how to investigate allegations of torture.  Chapter 5 of The Istanbul Protocol, titled \nโPhysical Evidence of Torture,โ states: โTrauma to the ears, especially rupture of the tympanic \nmembrane, is a frequent consequence of harsh beatings.โ  It goes on to describe how to conduct \nan examination of the tympanic membrane and ear for injuries and hearing loss related to abuse \nand torture. \n435.  After his return from Albany Memorial Hospital, Pariis was sent back to \nsolitary confinement in Cell #14 on 4 East. \n436.  On or about August 14, 2018, Pariisโs mother and grandmother traveled \nby bus from Brooklyn to Albany to visit him and observed his injuries from the beating. \n437.  Albany County Jail medical records dated August 20, 2018 document that \nPariis suffered a โL TM perforation, concussion, Head Injuryโ on August 9, 2018 and that he \nwas โsent to ER on 8/13/18 because of ear pain L TM perf.  He was started on Augmentin and \nreferred to ENT.  CT head/cspine/facial bones negative.โ \n438.  One month after the assault on September 4, 2018, Pariis was taken to see \na doctor at Albany Medical Center to assess the perforation to his left ear.  Albany Medical \nCenter records from that visit document that Pariis had suffered โsignificant facial abrasions and \nperiorbital ecchymosesโ as a result of the assault. \n439.  Periorbital ecchymosis, or โraccoon eye,โ is produced by blood tracking \ninto periorbital tissues, which is a frequent symptom after traumatic injuries to the head and \nneck. \n61 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 66 of 101\n440.  Albany County Jail medical records dated November 18, 2018, document \nthat Pariis continues to suffer from headaches from the assault. \n441.  The Albany County Jail reports about the assault against Pariis claim that \nhe repeatedly โturned aroundโ to assault multiple staff members in riot gear while locked in a \nconfined space:   \nAt the above date and time, Inmate Tillery was admitted to the SHU.  \nInmate Tillery was escorted to Holding Cell 2 for the read in to be \ncompleted.  When the mechanical restraints were removed, Inmate \nTillery immediately turned around and began throwing punches at \nofficers.  Inmate was taken to the floor and restrained.  Once \ncompliant, Inmate was placed back on the wall.  During the strip \nsearch, Inmate again turned towards staff, threw punches, and began \nspitting.  Spit mask applied,  Inmate restrained. \n \n442.  After the assault, Defendant Lyons came to Pariisโs cell and stated: โYou \nare not on Rikers anymore, we run this jail.โ \n443.  Since the assault on August 9, 2018, Albany County Jail guards have \ncontinued to taunt Pariis about the beating, stating that when he first arrived at Albany County \nJail, โyou were crying like a little girl.โ \n444.  Pariis has also heard Defendant Torrisi use racial epithets toward another \nAfrican-American detainee in SHU.  Defendant Torrisi stated to another detainee within Pariisโs \nhearing: โYouโve got to be the stupidest ni**er I ever met.  Do you want to get beat up?โ \nD.  Pariis Tillery Is Held in Solitary Confinement at the Albany County Jail \nSince August 9, 2018 \n(cid:3)\n445.  An infraction ticket that falsely accused Pariis of assaulting staff, dated \nAugust 9, 2018, was generated. \n62 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 67 of 101\n446.  A disciplinary hearing was held on August 24, 2018, at which Pariis \nappeared. \n447.  Pariis had no opportunity to prepare for the hearing and was not given an \nopportunity to identify or call witnesses. \n448.  The hearing officer, Defendant Lieutenant Frank Foe #3, sentenced Pariis \nto the extraordinary amount of 300 days in solitary confinement. \n449.  Pariis remains in solitary confinement, where he has been continuously \nsince August 9, 2018. \n450.  Pariis has been kept in a small solitary cell for at least 23 hours a day.  \nPariis has nothing to do in his cell: no meaningful human interaction, no education or \nprogramming, no music or television, and limited reading materials. \n451.  Pariis initially had no access to phone calls and was denied the right to \ncontact his lawyer for his pending criminal case, interfering with his ability to participate in his \nown defense. \n452.  Pariis now has limited access to phone calls, is not permitted to talk to \nother detainees, and other than access to showers three times a week, he is not permitted to leave \nhis cell.   The cost of collect phone calls from Albany is also prohibitive for Pariisโs family, since \nthe charge is $25 for 30 minutes. \n453.  Pariis usually declines to spend his one hour a day of โrecreationโ in the \ncage outside his cell because it is not materially different from staying in his cell. \n454.  Pariis is permitted visitors one hour a week.  To visit, his elderly mother \nmust take a long bus ride from New York City.  The cost of the transportation for the visit is \noften prohibitive for her.  Because of the distance, cost, a physical disability, and her age, she is \n63 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 68 of 101\nrarely able to visit Pariis in Albany.  When he was detained in New York City, she visited Pariis \nfrequently, as did other family members and friends. \n455.  Pariis has family, including a one-year-old son, whom he has not seen \nsince his transfer to the Albany County Jail on August 9, 2018, because of the distance.  When \nhe was in New York City, Pariis received visits from and had contact with his young son on a \nregular basis. \n456.  Pariis is only permitted to access mental health services in his cell, when a \ncounselor will come to his cell and speak with him in the presence of a correction officer without \nprivacy or confidentiality. \n457.  Since the assault by Defendants, Pariis has continued to experience \nheadaches, dizziness, tinnitus, ear and other pain, emotional distress, and traumatic thoughts.   \n(cid:3)\nIX.  The Experiences of Other New York City Detainees Transferred to Albany \n \n458.  Other New York City detainees transferred to Albany County have been \nsubjected to the same brutality, following the same pattern. \nRichard Roe \n459.  On January 24, 2018, a then-24-year-old African-American detainee \nRichard Roe arrived at the Albany County Jail from Ulster County along with Plaintiff John Doe. \n460.  Albany County Jail officers, under the direction of Defendant Torrisi, beat \nRichard Roe in his assigned cell in 4 East. \n461.  Richard Roe was later sentenced to 450 days in solitary confinement. \n64 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 69 of 101\n462.  Yet again, official reports from the Albany County Jail falsely claim that \nofficers had to use force defensively after the detainee โturned off the wallโ: \nCERT Team 1 escorted [the inmate] through the booking process, \nx-ray and escort to the SHU.  After a positive x-ray for contraband, \ninmate was placed on the wall in his cell and ordered to remove the \nobject.  Inmate turned off the wall 2 times and was taken to the \nfloor . . . . \n \nDavid Doe \n463.  Other detainees who arrived at the Albany County Jail with Plaintiff \nSteven Espinal on February 13, 2018 were also beaten. \n464.   On January 24, 2018, 18-year old detainee David Doe arrived at the \nAlbany County Jail from Rikers. \n465.  Albany County Jail officers, under the direction of Defendant Torrisi, \nrepeatedly punched David Doe in his face and body in a booking cell when he was unable to \nfollow commands to remove his clothing in a specific way. \n466.  After officers claimed to have seen an object in his rectum on an x-ray, the \nofficers took David Doe to Cell #16 in 4 East.  There, they continued to beat David Doe until \nthey claimed that the object had been removed to their satisfaction. \n467.  David Doe, who has since turned 19, remains at the Albany County Jail in \nsolitary confinement. \n65 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 70 of 101\nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 โ Fourteenth Amendment โ Procedural Due Process \n(Plaintiffs Washington and Espinal Against Defendants City, Brann, and Williams) \n \n468.  The Rules of the City of New York, title 40, ยง 1-17(b)(1)(ii), confer upon \npretrial detainees in City custody who are ages 21 and younger a constitutionally protected \nliberty interest in not being subjected to solitary confinement. \n469.  Plaintiffs Washington and Espinal were deprived of that liberty interest \nwhen Defendants Brann and Williams obtained SJOs transferring them to Albany County. \n470.  The deprivation occurred without due process of law because Plaintiffs \nWashington and Espinal did not receive notice of the impending transfer, notice of the reasons \nfor the transfer, or an opportunity to be heard. \n471.  Defendant City caused the deprivation because it has an official policy or \ncustom of transferring pretrial detainees ages 21 and younger to other jurisdictions on SJOs \nwithout providing notice of the impending transfer, notice of the reasons for the transfer, or an \nopportunity to be heard. \n472.  Defendant City is also liable for the deprivation because Defendant Brann \nacted in her capacity as the final municipal policymaker with respect to SJOs pursuant to state \nlaw. \n473.  As a result of Defendantsโ unlawful conduct, Plaintiffs Washington and \nEspinal suffered the injuries hereinbefore alleged. \n66 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 71 of 101\nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 โ Fourteenth Amendment โ Substantive Due Process โ Punitive Transfer \n(All Plaintiffs Against Defendants City, Brann, and Williams; Plaintiff Washington \nAdditionally Against Defendant Walker; Plaintiff Doe Additionally Against Defendant \nSullivan) \n \n474.  Defendants Brann and Williams obtained SJOs to transfer Plaintiffs \noutside the City for the purpose of punishing them and without legitimate penological \njustification, in violation of their substantive due process rights. \n475.  As evidenced by the comments made to Plaintiff Washington, Defendant \nWalker caused Plaintiff Washington to be transferred outside the City on an SJO for the purpose \nof punishing him and without legitimate penological justification, in violation of his substantive \ndue process rights. \n476.  As evidenced by his comments to Plaintiff Doe, Defendant Sullivan \ncaused Plaintiff Doe to be transferred outside the City on an SJO for the purpose of punishing \nhim and without legitimate penological justification, in violation of his substantive due process \nrights. \n477.  Defendant City caused the violation of Plaintiffsโ substantive due process \nrights because it has an official policy or custom of transferring pretrial detainees ages 21 and \nyounger to other jurisdictions on SJOs for the purpose of subjecting them to a form of \npunishmentโpunitive segregationโunavailable in City jails. \n478.  Defendant City is also liable for the violation of Plaintiffsโ substantive due \nprocess rights because Defendant Brann acted in her capacity as the final municipal policymaker \nwith respect to SJOs pursuant to state law. \n479.  As a result of Defendantsโ unlawful conduct, Plaintiffs suffered the \ninjuries hereinbefore alleged. \n67 \n(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306   Document 1   Filed 12/28/18   Page 72 of 101\nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 โ First Amendment Retaliation \n(Plaintiff Washington Against Defendants City, Brann, Williams, and Walker) \n \n480.  On or about March 28, 2018, Defendants Brann and Williams requested \nthat Plaintiff Washington be transferred outside the City on an SJO. \n481.  As evidenced by the comments made to Plaintiff Washington, Defendant \nWalker caused Plaintiff Washington to be transferred outside the City on an SJO. \n482.  Defendants Brann, Williams, and Walker did so for the purpose of \npunishing Plaintiff Washington for the exercise of his First Amendment rights, including by \nlodging repeated complaints with the Legal Aid Society Prisonersโ Rights Project. \n483.  Defendants Brann, Williams, and Walkerโs actions were without \nlegitimate penological justification. \n484.  Defendant City is liable for the violation of Plaintiff Washingtonโs \nsubstantive due process rights because Defendant Brann acted in her capacity as the final \nmunicipal policymaker with respect to SJOs pursuant to state law. \n485.  As a result of Defendantsโ unlawful conduct, Plaintiff Washington \nsuffered the damages hereinbefore alleged. \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 โ Fourteenth Amendment โ Excessive Force Against Pretrial Detainee \n (Plaintiff Washington Against Defendants City, Albany County, Apple, Lyons, Torrisi, Valvo, \nโSuperman,โ Lawson, Haley, LaBombard, Anzalone, and Shield #323) \n \n486.

For one thing, I want to know what the City's plans are with \nrespect to moving to dismiss the complaint. For another, I want to \nexplore whether a significant portion of this case does not need to be \nsevered and moved to the Northern District of New York. Cases \ninvolving allegation of brutality by corrections officers located in the \nNDNY are litigated in the NDNY, not in NYC. Adding allegations that \nthe City is somehow responsible for that brutality because it transferred \nthe plaintiffs to Albany knowing that they would/might be abused does \nnot change that. All that means is that there is some overlap is discovery. \nBut I cannot for the life of me see why I should be litigating the \nconditions in the Albany County Jail down here.

The City of New York, et al., 18 Civ. 12306 (CM). \nEarlier this week, I entered a decision and order denying motions to \ndismiss, sever or transfer this action. I am of the opinion of this court \nthat certain matters alleged in the attached pleading, which contains \nserious allegations of the deliberate abuse of youthful pre-trial detainees, \nshould be investigated by law enforcement. I emphasize that this court \nhas yet to make any findings about the veracity of these allegations. The \ncivil action presently pending before me is at a preliminary stage, and \nthe allegations of the complaint -- which had to be presumed true for \npurposes of the recently-decided motions -- have not yet been tested in \nthe cauldron of pre-trial discovery. However, some of the allegations in \nthe attached pleading concerning the treatment of the four named \ndefendants - particularly, though not exclusively, those relating to their \ntreatment at the Albany County Correctional Facility - are of such \nseriousness that I believe they should be investigated at the earliest \nopportunity. Hence I am making this referral at an earlier stage that I \nmight otherwise. I thank you for your attention to this matter.

They do not move to dismiss any claims. \nThe City Defendants' Motion to Dismiss is DENIED.  The Albany Defendants' and \nDefendant Mylroie's Motions to Sever are DENIED without prejudice.  Finally, Plaintiff \nEspinal's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction is DENIED. \nFACTS \nThe relevant facts are drawn from the Amended Complaint (the \"FAC\") and are taken as \ntrue for the purpose of resolving this motion. \nI.  The Practice of Solitary Confinement \nSolitary confinement is the practice of placing inmates in cells by themselves.  While in \nsolitary, inmates in have limited to no human contact.  In recent years, the practice has come \nunder significant criticism from researchers, policymakers, and even the judiciary for the dire \nimpact that it can have on a detainee's mental health. \nResearch on the impact of solitary confinement illuminates its dangers.  Solitary \nconfinement is associated with an increased risk of suicidal tendencies, anxiety, depression, and \nparanoia.  (Am. Compl., Dkt. No. 41, ~ 32.)  The impact of solitary is particularly harmful for \nyouth, whose brains are not fully developed and who might experience accelerated onset of \nserious mental illnesses as a result oftheir time in isolation.  (Id ~ 35.) \nIn August of2014, the United States Department of Justice released an investigative \nreport on conditions at Rikers Island, in which it observed that DOC's reliance on solitary \nconfinement to discipline adolescent detainees risked \"expos[ing] them to a risk of serious harm\" \n2 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 3 of 82\nand created a \"vicious cycle\" of behavioral concerns.  (Id. ~ 29.)  Two months later, the New \nYorker told the story ofKaliefBrowder, a Rikers pre-trial detainee who spent 17 months in \nsolitary confinement.  The story detailed the paranoia and suicidal tendencies Browder \ndeveloped while in isolation, and the impact that experience continued to have on him.  Browder \ncommitted suicide less than a year after the article appeared.  (!d.  ~ 30.) \nII.  The 2015 Regulation Limiting Solitary Confinement \nIn January 2015, anned with firsthand knowledge and scientific research about the \ndangers of solitary confinement, the New York City Board of Correction (the \"Board\") adopted a \nregulation that harmed solitary confinement for inmates under age 22.  (!d. ~~ 29-30, 34-35, 37); \nsee also 40 RCNY ยง 1-17.  The Board is an independent body that is responsible for establishing \nminimum standards for the treatment of detainees held by the City; the standards are codified in \nthe Rules of the City of New York and have binding legal effect.  (Am. Compl. ~ 38.) \nThe January 2015 regulation, codified as 40 RCNY ยง 1-17,  harmed solitary confinement \nfor detainees under the age of 18 immediately, and for detainees aged 18-21 as of January 1, \n2016, provided sufficient resources were made available to DOC by that time.  See 40 RCNY ยง \n1-17(b)(1).  The 18-21 ban finally went into effect in October 2016.  (Am. Compl. ~~ 40, 44-45.) \n40 RCNY ยง 1-17 also limited the amount of time any inmate could spend in solitary; adult \ninmates can spend no more than 30 days in a row in solitary unless the sentence is for a serious \nassault on correction staff, which canยทies a maximum of 60 days.  (!d. ~ 46); see also 40 RCNY ยง \n1-17(d). \nPlaintiffs allege that the City is attempting to circumvent the ban on solitary for pretrial \ndetainees under age 22 by sending \"undesirable\" yOlmg detainees-particularly, but not limited \nto, those who have been involved in altercations with guards- 160 miles away, to Albany \nCounty Correctional Facility (\"ACCF\"), where they are subjected the harsh punishment of \n3 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 4 of 82\npunitive segregation - a punishment that could not be imposed upon them at DOC facilities.  (Id \n~~ 60, 66.)  Reports indicate that since the ban was adopted in 2015, transfers of irnnates aged 21 \nand younger have increased sharply.  (Id. ~~ 60-62.)  This is despite the fact that Rikers has \nalternative forms of restrictive housing available for detainees between ages 18 and 21, such as \nEnhanced Supervision Housing.  (Id ~~ 60, 66.) \nIII.  The Transfer Process \nThe transfer of detainees between facilities in New York is governed by both Corrections \nLaw ยง 504 and 9 NYCRR ยง 7210.6. \nIn order to effectuate a transfer between facilities in different counties, the New York \nState Corrnnission of Correction (the \"SCOC\") must issue a \"substitute jail order\" (\"SJO\").  (Id. \n~ 52.)  SJOs are issued under specific circumstances, including when the safety or security of \ndetainees or a group of detainees is threatened by their confinement in a particular facility, and \nthe facility administrator believes that safety and the public interest require that these detainees \nbe housed in another facility.  (Id. ~53.) \nTo obtain an SJO, the administrator of the original facility must follow procedures \noutlined in 9 NYCRR ยง 7210.6.  (Id ~~52-57.) First, the \"faculty administrator determines that \nit is necessary to transfer an irnnate ... to another suitable place or facility.\"  9 NYCRR ยง \n7210.6(a).  Then, the administrator identifies \"another facility within the county which may be \ndesignated as a substitute jail.\" I d.  ยง 7210.6(b) (emphasis added).  If there is no \"suitable\" place \nin the county, the administrator \"shall determine whether the county jail of another county is able \nto accorrnnodate the irnnate.\" Id  In doing so, the administrator \"shall take into account\" factors \nsuch as the ability to house the irnnate \"in a manner consistent with applicable standards\" \n(which in this case would obviously include no solitary confinement for inmates under age 22); \n\"proximity\" (a word that means \"closeness\") to the county jail; \"potential inconvenience to the \n4 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 5 of 82\nfamily and friends\" (who might want to visit but be unable to travel long distances); \"access to \nlegal counsel and other resources;\" and the ability to \"provide proper security and supervision of \nthe inmate.\"  Id.  ยง 7210.6(c).  The administrator must obtain \"assurance that the facility \nadministrator of the receiving facility will house the inmates.\"  !d.  ยง 7210.6(d).  The facility \nadministrator then provides the SCOC with the \"pertinent information\" needed to determine \nwhether an SJO should be granted.  !d. ยง 7210.6(d).  The SCOC then approves the transfer, and \nthe facility administrator makes the necessary arrangements to effectuate the transfer.  !d. \nAn affidavit from former DOC Captain Edward Williams, submitted in an Article 78 \nproceeding, describes how this process works in practice.  (Reply Dec!. of Douglas E. Lieb \n(\"Lieb Dec!.\"), Dkt. No. 64, Ex. 1 (\"Williams Aff.\").Y  First, Williams would determine that he \nwanted to transfer the detainee and investigate what other facilities might be suitable.  (Id.  '\\['\\[5-\n6.)  He then would contact the facility and wait to hear if it would accept the detainee.  (!d.'\\['\\[ \n10-11.)  Once he received the facility's approval, he would submit a transfer request.  (!d. '\\[14.) \nThe SCOC then issued the SJO approving the transfer.  (!d.) \nIn circumstances in which, due to \"extraordinary circumstances,\" the facility \nadministrator \"reasonably believes\" that safety of the inmate or public safety and security would \nbe preserved by transfer, the procedures are slightly different.  They are outlined in ยง 721 0.6(e ). \nThe rule says that the facility administrator must make a written request to the commissioner to \n\"make available an institution\" for the inmate.  9 NYCRR ยง 721 0.6(e ) (1 ).  However, as a matter \nof practice, the facility administrator specifies the institution to which the inmate should be \ntransfenยทed.  (Dec!. of Katharine Rosenfeld (\"Rosenfeld Dec!.\"), Dkt. No. 38, Ex. 19) (\"In order \n1 The Court considers this affidavit on the motion to dismiss because it is incorporated into the Complaint \nby reference.  See Tellabs, Inc. v. Makar Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 322 (2007). \n5 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 6 of 82\nto ensme Mr. Espinal's continued safety and security, a determination was made pursuant to \nCorrection Law ยง504(2) and in accordance with 9 CRR-NY ยง7210.6(e)(l), that [ACCF] would \nserve as the adjunct State correctional institution and application was made to the [SCOC] for \napproval of the transfer.\").2  Upon the written determination of the commissioner that \"such \ninstitution is available,\" the facility administrator transfers the inmate to the custody of the \ncommissioner.  The legal custody of the inmate remains with the facility administrator. \n9 NYCRR ยง 721 0.6(e  )(2).  In practice, the commissioner then houses the inmate in the \ndesignated institution, even though the rule states that the inmate should be housed in the in the \n\"most proximate available institution,\" considering the secmity needs of the inmate.  I d.  The \nrule does not mandate that the administrator consider the other factors listed in ยง 721 0.6( c) when \ntransferring an inmate pursuant to ยง 721 0.6(e ).  Ultimately, if the facility administrator \ndetermines that the original facility is inappropriate for the inmate for the longer term, the facility \nadministrator is responsible for finding another suitable facility and must ask the commission to \ndesignate it as a substitute jail. !d. ยง 721 0.6(e  )(3). \nWhen an inmate is housed in another facility, the original jurisdiction pays the receiving \njurisdiction's expenses of holding the detainee.  (Am. Compl. ~55.) This can be a lucrative \nbusiness for jails; in 2013, housing other counties' detainees on SJOs brought Albany County \nmore that $3 million in revenue.  The Sheriff of ACCF has stated that Albany Officials are \n\"trying to run our jail as a business.\"  (!d. ~58.) \n2 While this Jetter was submitted in support of Plaintiff Steven Espinal's Motion for a Preliminary \nInjunction, the Court can consider it on a motion to dismiss because it is incorporated into the FAC by reference. \n(Am. Compl.1[224.); see also Tellabs, Inc., 551 U.S. at 322. \n6 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 7 of 82\nIV.  The City's Transfer of Detainees to ACCF \nPlaintiffs allege that the City has a policy and custom of sending difficult young detainees \nto ACCF in order to punish them.  They allege that a specific pattern is followed when a young \ndetainee is transferred upstate - a pattern to which every New York City detainee who has been \nbrought to ACCF on an SJO in the past two years has been subjected.  (Id. '1[ 99.) \nFirst, prior to leaving Rikers, the detainee is strip-searched, shackled, and loaded into a \nvan, which takes him to ACCF.  (Id. '1['1[ 67-68.)  He receives no advance notice of his transfer, \neven though such notice is required.  (Id. '1['1[ 57, 67.) \nUpon anival at ACCF, the detainee is subjected to a \"routine of torture.\"  (!d. '1[ 71.)  He \nis escorted to the intake area of the ACCF by DOC Emergency Services Unit (\"ESU\") \nCorrections Officers (\"COs\")-the New York City COs who transported him from Rikers to \nAlbany.  (Id. '1[ 74.)  There, he is handed over to the \"Green Team\"- a group of ACCF COs \nwearing paramilitary uniforms.  (Id. '1['1[ 72, 75.)  The detainee is transfened from DOC handcuffs \nto Albany handcuffs, and ACCF COs take him to a booking cell.  He is given a series of arbitrary \nand increasingly convoluted commands to follow; every time he gets confused, he is punched. \n(Id. '1['1[ 76-77.)  Then, the detainee's cuffs are removed and the Green Team, directed by \nDefendant Tonisi, assaults him.  (Id. '1[ 78.)  The DOC ESU officers who brought the detainee to \nAlbany are often present inside the intake area while this assault occurs, and can see and hear \nwhat is happening.  (Id. '1[ 79.) \nNext, the detainee is subjected to a body scanner (the \"BOSS Chair\"), a medical detector, \nand a medical x-ray, all of which are used to search for contraband in body cavities.  (Id. '1[ 80.) \nHe is then taken to a solitary confinement cell.  (!d. '1[ 81.)  At some point during this process, \nDefendant Torrisi claims to have seen contraband inside the detainee's rectum, and ACCF COs \nphysically and sexually assault him under the pretext of attempting to remove the real or \n7 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 8 of 82\nimagined contraband.  (Id . ~~ 82, 88.)  These attacks often result in injuries, but the detainee is \ndenied sufficient medical care by Defendant Mylroie, the assigned medical provider.  (Id ~ 90.) \nAfter the assault, the detainee is written up for \"assaulting staff,\" among other infractions. \n(Id ~ 91.)  He is given a disciplinary hearing, which Plaintiffs allege is a predetermined, sham \nhearing lacking a standard processes.  The hearing always results in the detainee's being found \nguilty of multiple infractions,  (id ~ 93 ), and the penalty is a long period of solitary confinement \n-often for over a year,  (id ~ 94). \nWhile in solitary confinement at ACCF, the detainee remains in his cell for a minimum of \n23 hours per day - he is provided with one hour of \"recreation\" by himself in an indoor cage, \nwhich many detainees decline because it is \"functionally indistinguishable from their cells.\" \n(Id. ~ 96.)  While at ACCF, detainees do not have access to unmonitored legal calls, and have \ndifficulty accessing confidential legal communications.  (Id ~~ 120-23.) \nPlaintiffs allege that the City and its policymakers are aware of the increased transfer \nrates, the failure to provide notice of the transfers, and the mistreatment of Rikers detainees in \nAlbany.  (Id ~~ 102-03.)  They allege the City is on notice because: (l) letters to DOC's general \ncounsel from Plaintiffs' attorneys- and attorneys for non-Plaintiff detainees-have alerted them \nto the beatings and mistreatment; (2) a notice of claim was filed with the City Comptroller \ndescribing Espinal's assault upon his arrival at ACCF; (3) Plaintiff and non-Plaintiff detainees \nhave filed multiple Article 78 petitions asserting that their rights are being violated; and, (4 ) the \nNew York Times published a story on July 22,2018 detailing ACCF's treatment ofRikers \ndetainees.  (Id. ~~ 105-13.)  The first of these notices-a letter describing an ACCF CO's assault \non a Rikers detainee upon his arrival at ACCF-was sent by the detainee's criminal defense \nattorney to the City on February 16, 2018.  (Id.  ~ l 06.) \n8 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 9 of 82\nV.  The Four Plaintiffs' Experiences \nThe named Plaintiffs in this case-Davon Washington, Steven Espinal, Jolm Doe, and \nPariis Tillery-all allege experiences that fit this pattern.  (/d. ,  124.) \nA.  Davon Washington \nWashington was anested and taken into DOC custody in March 2016, at the age of 19. \n(/d.,, 127-28.)  In March 2018, he lodged complaints with Legal Aid Society Prisoners' Rights \nProject, alleging that he was groped by DOC staff and denied adequate mental health and \nmedical care; Legal Aid relayed these complaints to DOC on or about March 16 and \nMarch 26, 2018.  (/d. ,  131.) \nOn March 28, 2018, Washington was ordered to pack his things, removed from his cell, \nand strip-searched.  (/d. ,  133.) During the search, a CO told him that Defendant Sharlisa \nWalker \"can't be around you,\" and that he would be going \"offRikers\" to Albany because \n\"Deputy Walker don't want you.\"  (/d. ,  136.)  Rikers COs then transported Washington to \nACCF.  (/d. ,  141-42.)  Washington was given no notice of the basis of the transfer, received no \nhearing, and was not permitted to call any family or lawyers to inform them of his whereabouts. \n(!d., 138.)  The SJO authorizing Washington's transfer, procured by Defendant Williams on \nbehalf of Brann, cited \"safety considerations\" as the reason for the transfer.  (/d. ,, 13 9-40.) \nThere are no indications that Washington was transfened pursuant to \"extraordinary \ncircumstances,\" which leads to the inference that he was transfened pursuant toยง 7210.6 (a-d). \nUpon his anยทival in Albany, Washington was greeted by members of the \"Green Team,\" \nwho, along with two to three Rikers ESU officers, brought him into the intake area of the jail. \n(!d., 143.)  The ESU officers removed Washington's cuffs and he was placed in Albany Cuffs. \n(/d., 144.)  The ACCF COs then brought him into booking cell #2, where eight to ten other COs \nwere waiting for him, including Defendant Tonisi.  (/d.,, 146-47.)  Defendant Tonยทisi told \n9 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 10 of 82\nWashington to put his head on the wall, and then hit him in the face while simultaneously asking \nWashington why he was transferred to ACCF.  (!d. -,r 149.)  COs then removed his handcuffs and \nproceeded to hit, punch, kick, and stomp on Washington while he lay on the ground.  (Id. -,r-,r 150-\n55.)  The Albany COs then instructed Washington to get naked and continued to beat him.  The \nCOs forcefully inserted two fingers into Washington's rectum, attempting to remove purported \ncontraband.  (!d. -,r-,r 159, 162-63.)  The Rikers ESU officers were still in the intake area and were \naware of what was happening.  (!d.  -,r 153.) \nAfter this beating, Washington was searched for contraband; he sat in the BOSS chair, \nwent through a metal detector, and underwent a medical x-ray.  (Id. -,r-,r 164-66.)  All the while, \nhe was bleeding from his nose and mouth.  When Washington told a nurse that he had injuries, \ntwo COs responded by punching him in the face.  Immediately after, the nurse again asked him if \nhe had injuries; this time, he said no.  (Jd. -,r 167.) \nWashington was then taken to a cell in the Segregated Housing Unit (\"the SHU\")-the \nhousing unit for inmates in punitive segregation - where he was again ordered to get naked.  (Jd. \n-,r 169.)  He remained shackled.  COs punched and kicked him until he had blood all over his face \nand was visibly injured.  (!d. -,r 171.)  Out of fear, Washington denied medical attention when it \nwas offered, but he was clearly injured-his face was bleeding and swollen, his tooth was \nchipped, and he was bruised all over his body.  (!d.  -,r-,r 171, 173.) \nWashington received an infraction ticket for the incident, which accused him of attacking \nstaff.  (!d. -,r 175.) A disciplinary hearing was held; Washington's only statement was that he had \nnothing to say about the incident.  (!d. -,r 177.)  The hearing resulted in a sentence of 3 60 days in \npunitive segregation.  (Jd. -,r 178.) \n10 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 11 of 82\nWashington was ultimately held in the SHU for around eight months, until his departure \nfrom ACCF in December 2018. (Id  'I 180.)  While in the SHU, he was denied access to \neducational programming.  He was also put on new psychiatric medications and he lost \nsignificant amounts of weight.  (Id 'i'i 185-87.)  His only time outside of his cell was one hour \nper day in an empty, metal, chain-link cage placed next to a window in the hallway outside his \ncell.  (Id . 'I 182.) \nWashington also alleges a separate incident of assault in October 2018, where three \nACCF COs assaulted him after a legal visit with counsel in this action and threatened that what \nWashington was \"doing\" was not going to work.  (Id 'i'i 189-96.) \nB.  Steven Espinal \nEspinal was arrested in November 2017 at the age of 18.  (Id 'i'i 200-01.)  On February \n10, 2018, he and other detainees were involved in an altercation with a CO, which received \nwidespread media coverage.  (Id 'i'i 204-06.)  The Court has viewed the video of the incident; it \nappears that Espinal was the initial perpetrator. \nEspinal was arraigned in Bronx Criminal Court on February 12,2018, on charges \nstemming from the February 10 incident.  (Id. 'I 209.) \nOn February 13, 2018, Espinal was picked up by ESU early in the morning, placed in a \nvan with two other detainees who were also alleged to have been involved in the February 10 \nincident, and driven to ACCF.  (Id. 'i'i 210-12.) He was given no notice of his transfer and he \nwas not told where he was going.  (Id 'I 213.) \nAn SJO was issued on that very day, February 13, 2018, on the basis that DOC was \n\"unfit\" for Espinal's confinement due to \"safety considerations.\" The initial SJO was requested \nby Williams upon the application of Brann, and was effective through April!, 2018.  (Dec!. of \n11 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 12 of 82\nC.? \nMark D. Zuckerman (\"Zuckerman Dec!.\"), Dkt. No. 53, Ex.  Then, on March 28,2018, \nanother SJO was issued, effective from April!, 2018 sine die until rescinded.  (Id.)  In a letter \nsent to Espinal's criminal attorney in August 2018, DOC represented that it had transferred \nEspinal on an emergency basis pursuant to 9 NYCRR ยง 7210.6(e).  (Am. Compl. ~ 224; \nRosenfeld Dec!. Ex. 19 .) \nUpon his arrival at ACCF, Espinal encountered about 12 members of the Green Team. \n(Am. Compl. ~ 216.)  One of the ACCF COs said, \"We want Espinal first,\" and the ACCF COs, \nas well as two to three Rikers ESU officers, escorted him into the intake area.  (Id. ~~ 217-18.) \nEspinal was placed in Albany cuffs and shackles, and transferred into booking cell #2, where \neight to ten ACCF COs and supervisors were waiting for him.  (Id. ~~ 219-221, 228.) \nImmediately, Defendant Torrisi punched Espinal in the face, twice.  (Id. ~ 231.)  Torrisi \nsaid, in sum and substance, \"This isn't Rikers.  This is Albany County.  We do what we want.\" \n(Id . ~ 230.)  The COs punched him all over his body while he was still cuffed.  When Espinal fell \nto the ground, they kicked him and stomped on him.  (Id. ~~ 233-35.)  After Torrisi decided it \nwas \"enough,\" he told Espinal to face the wall.  (Id. ~ 236.)  Defendants then gave Espinal a \nseries of instmctions about how to remove his clothes; when he misunderstood or failed to \ncomply, they punched him in the ribs.  (Id ~ 238.)  After all of his clothes were removed, Espinal \nwas given a jumpsuit and searched for contraband using the BOSS chair, a metal detector, and a \nmedical x-ray.  (Id. ~~ 239-43.)  The COs reported that the x-ray had detected that Espinal had a \nweapon in his body.  (Jd. ~ 243.) \nThe COs next brought Espinal to the SHU, where a nurse said he was \"fine.\" (Id . ~~ 244-\n45.)  When he got to a cell, the COs again told him to get naked, which he did.  They then \n3 The Court considers the SJOs on the motion to dismiss because they are incorporated into the Complaint \nby reference.  See Tellabs, Inc., 551 U.S. at 322. \n12 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 13 of 82\nproceeded to punch and kick him several times, saying that they would get the contraband \"out \nof [him.]\"  (Id. ~~ 247-48.)  While Defendant Lawson held Espinal down, another CO proceeded \nto forcefully insert his fingers into Espinal's rectum, causing him great pain and to bleed; the CO \nsaid he could not feel anything.  (Id. ~ 249-50.)  The COs then told Espinal to defecate on the \nfloor to remove the contraband, threatening to beat it out of him if he could not extricate it \nhimself, all while continuing to assault him.  (Id. ~ 252.) They then ordered that he stand up, \ninforming him again that they were going to make him \"s**t it out\" and tased him from a few \nfeet away- even though he had his back to them- causing him to fall to the ground.  (Id . ~~ 254-\n56.) \nEspinal was taken to a shower and then strapped into a restraint chair, a physical restraint \ndevice that fastens a detainee to a chair at the wrists, ankles, thighs, arms, and head.  (Id ~~ 258-\n59.)  While Espinal was in the restraint chair, the COs continued to taunt and assault him.  (Id ~ \n260.)  He was kept in the chair ovemight.  (Id . ~ 261.) \nWhen he was released from the chair the next moming, Espinal was bleeding, bruised all \nover his body, dizzy, and unable to urinate nmmally.  (Id ~~ 262-63.) He was taken to Albany \nMedical Center, where staff documented scratches to his face, tenderness in his neck, midline \nspine, and suprapubic region, and multiple bruises and abrasions.  (Id . ~ 267 .)  At the hospital, \nEspinal told the staff he had lost consciousness in a \"fight\"-he says that he told the staff this lie \nout of fear that the COs would retaliate against him.  (Id. ~ 266.) \nAfter his return from the hospital, Espinal was sent back to the SHU.  (Id. ~ 268.)  Two \ndays later, on February 16, 2018, Espinal was brought back to the Bronx for a court appearance; \nthe Judge ordered that he be given immediate medical attention.  (Id. ~ 269.) \n13 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 14 of 82\nEspinal was charged with assaulting staff.  (!d. ~ 270.)  He was never served with an \ninfiยทaction, although one was generated on February 13, 2018.  (Id. ~ 272.)  On February 26, \n2018, Espinal had a disciplinary hearing, where he had no opportunity to call witnesses.  (Id. ~ \n275.)  Prior to the hearing, a sergeant told Espinal that \"no matter what happened,\" he would \nremain in punitive segregation.  (Id. ~ 274.) \nEspinal was sentenced to 600 days in solitary confinement.  He remained there for over a \nyear, despite the fact that a state court judge directed that he be released.  (Id. ~~ 276-77.)  He \nwas in solitary confinement when both the Complaint and FAC were filed.  (Id. ~ 278.)  During \nthis time, he did not receive educational services, other than an educational packet.  (Id. ~ 282.) \nHe received limited mental health services, which were administered in his cell in the presence \nof a CO.  (Id. ~ 284.)  The Albany Defendants also failed to comply with court orders that \nEspinal be produced in court for attorney's visits, and he twice missed court appearances.  (!d. ~~ \n285-86.) \nEspinal was assaulted a second time on July 4, 2018.  Espinal did not respond to a nurse \nmaking medical rounds because he was on medication that made him drowsy.  (!d. ~~ 290-91.) \nDue to his lack of response, COs entered his cell, pinned him to the bed, handcuffed and \nshackled him, beat him, and sprayed him with pepper spray.  (Id. ~~ 289-96.)  Espinal suffered \nmultiple injuries and again had to be taken to Albany Medical Center.  (Id. ~ 300.)  He had \ntrouble opening his jaw, which was swollen shut, a deep cut on his face, and was diagnosed with \n\"head trauma\" and \"left jaw pain and swelling post assault.\"  (!d. ~ 301.) \nOn April4, 2019, Espinal was transferred out of ACCF and into state custody to begin \nserving his sentence for his underlying crimes.  (Dkt. No. 91.)  He spent almost 14 months in \nsolitary confinement.  At all this time, he was less than 22 years old. \n14 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 15 of 82\nC.  John Doe \nDoe was arrested in December 2015.  (Am. Compl. 'i[313.) \nThere is no indication in the F AC that Doe attacked anyone or presented any danger to \nanyone at Rikers.  In January 2018, while Doe was being housed at the Manhattan Detention \nComplex (\"MDC\"), Defendant Sullivan told him, \"Soon enough we won't have to deal with your \nbullshit anymore.  You're going somewhere good, somewhere that you'll like.\"  (Id 'i[319.)  The \nnext day, Doe was transferred to Ulster County Jail.  After about a week at Ulster, he was \ntransferred to ACCF by DOC ESU officers.  (Id 'i['i[321, 326, 328.)  Defendant Williams \nacknowledged in an affidavit submitted in another proceeding that he !mew Doe was only in \nUlster temporarily, prior to being sent to ACCF, because ACCF indicated that it would not be \nable to receive the Rikers detainee until January 23,2018.  (Id 'i[325.) \nThe SJO for Doe's transfer to ACCF cites \"safety considerations\" as the reason for his \ntransfer.  The SJO was meant to be temporary-from January 24, 2018 through April I, 2018. \n(Zucketman Dec!. Ex. E.)  Nevertheless, Doe remained at ACCF until he was transfetTed to state \ncustody after he pled guilty to his underlying crime in October 2018.  (Am. Compl. 'i[401.) \nUpon his arrival at ACCF, Doe was greeted by the Green Team, under the command of \nDefendant Torrisi.  (!d. 'i['i[329-30.)  These COs escorted him to a booking cell, where he was \nsubjected to a strip search and told to follow confusing instmctions as to how to remove his \nclothes.  (Id 'i['i[331-32.)  During this process, COs kicked and hit Doe, causing him to fall to the \nground.  (Id 'lf'i[333-34.)  The COs then brought Doe to the BOSS chair and subjected him to an \nx-ray; during this process he was again hit by COs.  (Id 'i['i[336-37.)  The COs informed Doe that \nthe x-ray detected the presence of a razor in his rectum, and threatened that if he didn't give up \nthe weapon, it would be the \"worst day of[his]life.\" (Id 'i[339.) \n15 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 16 of 82\nDoe was then taken to the SHU, where he was held naked in a cell along with eight to ten \nCOs.  (Id. ~ 342.)  He was again told to extricate the razor.  (Id. ~ 343.)  After removing his \nhandcuffs, six to eight COs assaulted him with fists, batons, and pepper spray; one CO told Doe, \nin sum and substance, \"We kill people here.  Is that what you want?\"  (Id . ~~ 344-48.)  When \nDoe asked for food and water to stimulate his bowels, Defendant Torrisi slammed his head \nagainst the wall and instructed another officer to put a baton in his rectum, causing Doe to bleed. \n(Id. ~~ 353-56.)  Doe was then tasered multiple times, causing him to urinate and defecate on \nhimself and to lose consciousness multiple times.  (Id ~~ 358-63.)  During the assault, Defendant \nTo!Tisi said, in sum and substance, \"We're going to kill you.  This isn't Rikers anymore.\"  The \nCOs fmally told Doe the weapon was no longer inside of him, but tased him a final time as \nrevenge for defecating on one CO's shoes.  (Id ~ 369.) \nDoe was brought back to the x-ray room.  There, he asked for medical attention, which \nwas refused.  (Id. ~~ 371-72.)  He was given clothes, but denied an opportunity to clean and \ndecontaminate himself.  (Id. ~ 373.) The next morning, he again requested medical attention for \nhis injuries - which included an open wound on his forehead, two black eyes with one eye \nswollen shut, bruises to his ribs and chest, and bleeding from his rectum-but Defendant Mylroie \ndenied medical attention, only giving him Motrin.  (Id. ~~ 376-80.)  Doe was not examined by a \nphysician until a week after the beating.  (Id .  ~ 381.) \nDoe was written up for assaulting staff during his strip search.  (Id. ~~ 382-83.)  A \ndisciplinary hearing was held on February 6, 2018, where Doe denied the charges against him. \n(Id. ~ 385.)  The hearing officer said in sum, \"we are still going to find you guilty regardless,\" \nand sentenced him to 550 days in solitary confinement.  (Id . ~~ 386-87.)  Doe spent ten months \nin solitary.  (Id. ~ 388.)  During this time, he was tluยทeatened by ACCF staff who said that they \n16 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 17 of 82\nwould \"kill him\" if he snitched; he was also punched by COs on multiple occasions.  (!d. ~~ 395, \n97-98.) \nIn October 2018, Doe pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in \nthe third degree, and he is now serving his sentence in the custody of the state.  (!d.~~ 401-02.) \nDoe chose to accept what he believed to be a poor plea offer so he could get out of ACCF and \ninto a different facility.  (!d. ~ 403.) \nD.  Pariis Tillery \nPariis Tillery was arrested in MaTch 2017 and placed in DOC custody.  (!d.~ 407.) He \nwas detained at Brooklyn Detention Center, where, on August 7, 2018, he was alleged to have \nassaulted a CO.  (!d. ~ 408.)  The next day, he was transferred to Rikers Island, and the day after \nthat, he was transferred to ACCF.  (!d. ~ 41 0.)  Tillery was given no written notification for the \nbasis of his transfer, and was not told where he was going or even that he was going to be \ntransferred.  (Jd. ~ 413.)  The SJO providing for Tillery's transfer, obtained by Brann and \nWilliams, cited \"safety considerations.\"  (!d.~ 410; Zuckerman Dec!. Ex F.) \nUpon his arrival at ACCF, Green Team members greeted Tillery and took him into the \nintake area of the jail; he was accompanied by two to three Rikers ESU officers.  (!d.~~ 415-16.) \nThe ACCF COs cuffed and shaclded him, and brought him into a booking cell where eight to ten \nACCF COs and supervisors were waiting.  (!d. ~~ 418-19.)  The COs assaulted him by punching \nhim in the face and body and by kicking and stomping on him, even after he fell to the floor.  (!d. \n~~ 420-24.)  He began to bleed form his nose and Defendants placed a \"spit mask\" on his face, \neven though he was not spitting at anyone.  (!d. ~ 422.) Once CO told him, \"Do the same thing \nyou did on Rikers Island.\"  (!d. ~ 420.)  After about ten minutes, the COs brought Tillery to the \nBOSS chair and metal detector.  The scans did not indicate contraband, but the COs were \n17 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 18 of 82\nskeptical, telling Tillery that, \"You Rikers guys are always lying\" and \"If you have something, \nwe're going to beat you until you s**t it out.\"  (!d. ,, 425-26.) \nThe COs then escorted Tillery to a cell in the SHU, where he was instructed to remove \nhis jumpsuit, and told to \"take it out of your ass, you monkey\" (referring to the alleged \ncontraband), all while being threatened with a taser.  (Id. ,, 429-31.)  The COs punched, kicked \nand hit Tillery again, and then brought him for another x-ray.  (Id. ,, 431-33.)  When he returned \nto his cell, Defendant Mylroie came to see him and said he was fine, despite the fact that he was \nin extreme pain, was bleeding, had two black eyes and a swollen nose, and could not hear out of \nhis left ear.  (Id. ,, 435-36.) \nTillery requested medical attention the next day, August 10, and told COs that his head \nhurt and he could not hear from his left ear.  (Id., 437.)  Yet, it was not until August 13,2018, \nfour days after the assault, that Tillery was taken for treatment at Albany Memorial Hospital. \n(Id. ,  438.)  At the hospital, Tillery told personnel that he had been assaulted by the COs.  (Id . , \n439.)  He was diagnosed with a ruptured eardrum, a head injury, and a concussion.  He continued \nto suffer from headaches related to the assault for months.  (Id. ,, 447-49.) \nUpon his return from the hospital, Tillery was sent back to solitary.  (Id. ,  444.)  Around \nthis time, Defendant Lyons came to his cell and said, \"You are not on Rikers anymore, we run \nthis jail.\"  (Id., 451.) \nTillery received an infraction for assaulting staff, and a disciplinary hearing was held on \nAugust 24, 2018.  (Id. ,, 450, 454-55.)  Tillery had no opportunity to prepare, and was not given \nan opportunity to call witnesses; no testimony was taken.  (Id. ,  456.)  The hearing resulted in a \nsentence of300 days in solitary confinement.

(Id. \"if 458.) \nDuring this time, he had limited access to human interaction, education or programming, phone \ncalls (including to his attorney), and mental health care; it was also extremely difficult for his \nfamily to visit, including his one-year-old son.  (Id. \"if\"! 460-66.)  He was also subjected to \ntaunting by ACCF COs.  (Id. \"if 452.) \nOn January 23, 2019, four weeks after this lawsuit was filed, Tillery had a court date in \nBrooklyn and was told he was being transferred.  (Id . \"if 467 .)  After his court appearance, he was \nnot returned to ACCF, but was instead brought back to Rikers.  He received no explanation for \nhis transfer.  (Id . \"if 468.) \nVI.  Procedural History \nPlaintiffs filed their initial Complaint on December 28, 2018.  (Dkt. No. 1.)  On \nJanuary 28,2019, Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint (Dkt. No. 30), and Plaintiff Steven \nEspinal filed a motion for a preliminary injunction (Dkt. No. 31).  On February 11, 2019, the \nCity Defendants moved to dismiss (Diet. No. 48); Defendant Sullivan joined this motion on \nFebruary 25,2019 (Diet. No. 66).  On February 15,2019, the Albany Defendants moved to sever \n(Dkt. No. 58); on February 22,2019, Defendant Mylroie separately moved to sever \n(Dkt. No. 61).  On March 28,2019, Plaintiffs filed a motion to certify the class.  (Dkt. No. 86.) \nTHE CITY DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO DISMISS \nThe City Defendants have filed a Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Rules 12(b)(l), 12(b)(6), \nand 12(b)(7).  In an alternative to their 12(b)(7) motion, they have also filed a motion for an \norder joining the SCOC as a defendant pursuant to Rule 19(a)(l) and 19(a)(2). \nThis Motion is denied. \n19 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 20 of 82\nI.  The City Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the Entire Action Pursuant to 12(b )(7) \nThe City Defendants argue that they cannot be held liable for constitutional violations \nrelated to Plaintiffs' transfer because the SJOs authorizing the transfers were issued \"solely\" by \nthe SCOC.  (Defs.' Mem. of Law in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss, for Order Joining State \nCommission of Correction as De f., and in Opp. to Application for Prelim. Inj. of Pl. Steven \nEspinal (\"City Defs.' Br.\"), Dkt. No. 52, at 7 .)  They contend that DOC \"merely applied\" for the \nSJOs, and that any liability for constitutional violations related to the transfers must be directed \nat the SCOC, which ultimately issues the SJOs.  (Id .)  The City Defendants request two fotms of \nrelief: dismissal for failure to join a necessary party or, in the alternative, an order for Plaintiffs \nto join the SCOC. \nThe Court grants neither fotm of relief.  The F AC clearly alleges, in both theory and \npractice, the City Defendants are the driving force behind the transfer process and can (and \nshould) be held liable for their actions. \nA.  The SCOC Is Not a Necessary Party \nUnder Rule 12(b)(7), an action may be dismissed for failure to join a necessary party \nunder Rule 19.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(7).  Courts apply a two-part test to detetmine whether \nan action must be dismissed for failure to join an indispensable party.  \"First, the court must \ndetermine whether an absent party belongs in the suit, i.e., whether the party qualifies as a \n'necessary' party under Rule 19(a).\"  Viacom Int'l, Inc. v. Kearney, 212 F.3d 721, 724 (2d Cir. \n2000).  If a party does not quality as necessary under Rule 19(a), the Court does not need to \nmake any further decision with respect to the motion to dismiss.  I d.  If a party does qualify as \nnecessary, the Court looks to whether it is feasible to join that party; if it is not feasible to join \nthe necessary party, the Court determines whether the party is \"indispensable.\" Id. \nA party is \"necessary\" under Rule 19(a)(l) if: \n20 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 21 of 82\n(A) in the person's absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already \nparties; or (B) the person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and \nis so situated that the disposition of the action in the person's absence may: (i) as a \npractical matter impair or impede the person's ability to protect that interest; or (ii) \nleave an existing party subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or \notherwise inconsistent obligations because of the interest. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 19(a)(l). \nCourts assess three factors when determining whether a non-party is required:  \"(!) \nwhether the court can afford complete relief in the absence of the non-party; (2) whether the non-\nparty's absence will impair or impede its ability to protect its interests; and (3) whether the \nexisting parties would be subject to 'double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations.\"' \nHarty v. Spring Valley Marketplace LLC, No. 15-CV-8190 (NSR), 2017 WL 108062, at *12 \n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 9, 2017).  If any one of the three components is satisfied, the absent party \nconstitutes a required party. \nI.  19(a)(l)(A)-Complete Relief \nUnder the first factor of the Rule 19(a)(l) analysis, the court looks to whether complete \nrelief cannot be award among the existing parties without joinder of the party in question.  Tbis \nanalysis considers only those already parties to the litigation.  See MasterCard Int '!Inc. v.  Visa \nInt'l Serv. Ass 'n, Inc., 471 F.3d 377, 385 (2d Cir. 2006). \nFirst of all, the Court can afford Plaintiffs complete monetary relief without the SCOC \nbeing a party.  Joint tortfeasors are not de facto necessary parties; they do not need to be included \nin a single lawsuit to afford complete monetary relief.  See, e.g., Grimes v.  CBS Corp., No. 17 \nCIV. 8361 (AJN), 2018 WL 3094919, at *2-3 (S.D.N.Y. June 21, 2018).  All present and absent \ndefendants are jointly and severally liable, so Plaintiffs can choose to sue a subset oftortfeasors \nand obtain full damages from only those defendants.  See, e.g., id. at *2.  If the City were to be \nfound liable, it could then seek contribution from the SCOC as a joint tortfeasor.  I d.  The SCOC \n21 . \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 22 of 82\nis not a necessary party simply because it might share responsibility for the violation of \nPlaintiffs' rights. \nTurning to the injunctive relief, the City Defendants contend that Plaintiffs' request for \ninjunctive relief-including prohibiting the City Defendants from transferring class members to \nACCF, ordering that Espinal be returned to a conectional facility in New York, and \"nullifying \nand voiding\" any SJOs transferring Espinal out of the City-cannot be fulfilled without joining \nthe SCOC, because the SCOC ultimately approves the SJOs authorizing the transfers.  (City \nDefs.' Br. at 7.)  As Espinal is no longer at ACCF or in DOC custody, the only remaining request \nfor injunctive relief is the request to prohibit the City Defendants from transfening class \nmembers to ACCF. \nThe core allegations of the FAC are that the City Defendants arranged for detainees aged \n21 and younger to be transfened and held in Albany, where they would be subject to \"torture\" \nand placed in solitary confinement.  (Am. Compl. '1[ 10.)  Plaintiffs are not challenging any \n\"actions or policies\" of the SCOC - the allegations all have to do with actions taken by the City \nDefendants.  See Brooks v. Roberts, 251 F. Supp. 3d 401,434 (N.D.N.Y. 2017).  And Plaintiffs \nrequest relief that limits the City Defendants' actions.  In particular, they have requested that the \nCourt issue an injunction \"prohibiting Defendants City, Brann, and Williams from transfening \nclass members to the Albany County Conectional Facility.\"  (Am. Compl., Prayer for Relief, '1[ \ni.)  Fairly read, the injunction that is sought would prohibit the City officials from invoking the 9 \nNYCRR 7210.6 procedures in order to transfer class members to Albany- from asking the \nSCOC to approve their transfers.  The SCOC is not only not a necessary party to state a claim, it \nis not a proper party Defendant for such a claim. \n22 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 23 of 82\nIt is true that the SCOC approves the transfer requests.  But nothing in the F AC or the \nincorporated documents suggest that the SCOC initiates transfer requests or that it plays any role \nin determining where a detainee will be sent upon transfer.  All that is done by the City \nDefendants.  The Court can prohibit the City Defendants from asking the SCOC to approve \ntransfers of young inmates to ACCF without SCOC's being a defendant.  See Harty, 2017 WL \n108062, at * 12 (no joinder when possible to obtain adequate relief among named defendants). \nNothing suggests that pretrial detainees are permanently transferred to Albany without the City's \nrequest; indeed, any such transfer would be contrary to the law.  See 9 NYCRR ยง 7210.6(c).  The \nonly conduct sought to be enjoined is the conduct of the City Defendants- and an injunction \ndirected solely to their conduct would afford Plaintiffs complete injunctive relief. \n2.  19(a)(l)(B)(i) \nTurning to the second factor under Rule 19, the SCOC's absence from this lawsuit would \nnot prevent it fiยทom protecting its own interests.  The City Defendants point to no interest that \nwould be impeded because of the SCOC's absence.  Moreover, \"[f]or a party to be necessary \nwithin the meaning of Rule 19(a)(l)(B)(i), the absent party must be the one claiming the interest. \nA party named in the litigation cannot assert the interest on the absent party's behalf.\" See \nCant'! Cas. Co. v. Am. Home Assur. Co., No. 05 CIV 7874 LTS JCF, 2008 WL 1752231, at *4 \n(S.D.N.Y. Apr. 14, 2008) (internal citations removed).  The SCOC has not claimed an interest in \nthe litigation. \n3.  19(a)(l)(B)(ii) \nFinally, as to the third factor, there is no evidence that any party would face \"multiple or \ninconsistent liability\" without the SCOC' s presence. \n23 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 24 of 82\nFor these reasons, the Court does not find that the SCOC is a necessary party pursuant to \nRule 19(a).  Accordingly, the Motion to Dismiss the case pursuant to Rule 12(b)(7) is DENIED, \nas is the motion to direct that Plaintiffs be directed to join the SCOC as a defendant. \nII.  The City's Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to 12(b)(6) \nTwenty-two out of the thirty-tluee causes of action in the FAC implicate the City \nDefendants.  The City Defendants have moved to dismiss all of them. \nA.  Legal Standards \n1.  Standard of Review \nRule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides for dismissal of a \ncomplaint that fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). \n\"To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, \naccepted as tme, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 \nU.S. 662, 678 (2009) (internal quotation omitted). \n\"The plausibility standard is not akin to a 'probability requirement,' but it asks for more \nthan a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.\" Id  A plaintiff must plead facts \nthat \"allow the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the \nmisconduct alleged.\"  Id; see also Pension Ben. Guar. Corp. ex rei. St.  Vincent Catholic Med \nCenters Ret. Plan v. Morgan Stanley Inv. Mgmt. Inc., 712 F.3d 705, 717-18 (2d Cir. 2013). \nIn considering a motion to dismiss, the Court must accept as true all of the factual \nallegations in the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the Plaintiff.  See \nBanks v. Cty. of Westchester, 168 F. Supp. 3d 682, 687 (S.D.N.Y. 2016); see also Lopez v. \nCipolini, 136 F. Supp. 3d 570, 579 (S.D.N.Y. 2015).  However, it is not bound to accept legal \nconclusions that are \"couched as factual allegation[s].\" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. \n24 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 25 of 82\nThe Court may consider any written instrument attached to the complaint as an exhibit; \nany statement or documents incorporated by reference, as well as documents that are integral to \nthe complaint, which means that the complaint \"relies heavily\" on the document's \"terms and \neffect.\"  Chambers v.  Time Warner, Inc., 282 F.3d 147, 153 (2d Cir. 2002). \nUltimately, the motion to dismiss analysis is \"a context-specific task that requires the \nreviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\"  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. \n2.  Section 1983 \nPlaintiffs' claims against the City Defendants- with the exception of the thirteenth and \nfourteenth causes of action- are brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.  Section 1983 provides: \nEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or \nusage, of any State ... subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United \nStates ... to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the \nConstitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured ... \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.  \"Section 1983 does not create any independent substantive rights but rather is \na vehicle to 'redress ... the deprivation of [federal] rights established elsewhere.\"' Perez v. \nPonte, 236 F.

Roach, \n165 F.3d 137, 142 (2d Cir. 1999)). \nTo state a claim underยง 1983, the conduct \"must have been committed by a person \nacting under color of state law\" and \"must have deprived a person of rights, privileges, or \nimmunities secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\"  Cornejo v.

Individual Liability \nFor an individual to be held liable underยง 1983, he must have \"personal involvement\" in \nthe alleged constitutional deprivation.  Farrell v. Burke, 449 F.3d 470,484 (2d Cir. 2006). \nThere are five ways that a Plaintiff may establish \"personal involvement.\"  They are: \"(1) \nthe defendant participated directly in the alleged constitutional violation, (2) the defendant, after \nbeing informed of the violation through a report or appeal, failed to remedy the wrong, (3) the \ndefendant created a policy or custom under which unconstitutional practices occurred, or allowed \nthe continuance of such a policy or custom, (4 ) the defendant was grossly negligent in \nsupervising subordinates who committed the wrongful acts, or ( 5) the defendant exhibited \ndeliberate indifference to the rights of [the plaintiffs J by failing to act on information indicating \nthat unconstitutional acts were occutTing.\"  Warren v. Pataki, 823 F.3d 125, 136 (2d Cir. 2016) \n(quoting Colon v.  Coughlin, 58 F.3d 865, 873 (2d Cir. 1995)); see also Black v.

Department ofS ocial Services of the City ofN  ew York, 436 U.S. 658 (1978), \nthe Supreme Court found that a municipality can be held liable underยง 1983.  To establish a \nmunicipality's liability under ยง 1983, \"a plaintiff is required to plead and prove three elements: \n26 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 27 of 82\n(1) an official policy or custom that (2) causes the plaintiff to be subjected to (3) a denial of a \nconstitutional right.\"  Wray v.

Rodriguez, 702 F.2d 393,397 (2d Cir. 1983)). \nTo establish that there was an \"official policy or custom,\" a plaintiff may plead that the \nconstitutional violation was caused by: \"(1) a fmmal policy officially endorsed by the \nmunicipality; (2) actions taken by government officials responsible for establishing the \nmunicipal policies that caused the particular deprivation in question; (3) a practice so consistent \nand widespread that, although not expressly authorized, constitutes a custom or usage ofw  hich a \nsupervising policy-maker must have been aware; or, (4) a failure by policymakers to provide \nadequate training or supervision to subordinates to such an extent that it amounts to deliberate \nindifference to the rights of those who come into contact with the municipal employees.\" \nCalderon v.  City ofN  ew York, 138 F. Supp. 3d 593, 611 (S.D.N.Y. 2015), on reconsideration in \npart, No. 14 CIV. 1082 PAE, 2015 WL 6143711 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 19, 2015) (emphasis added) \n(citing Brandon v.  City ofN  ew York, 705 F.Supp.2d 261,276-77 (S.D.N.Y. 2010)). \nA municipal policy may be rooted in inaction.  A \"city's 'policy of inaction' in light of \nnotice that its program will cause constitutional violations is the functional equivalent of a \ndecision by the city itself to violate the Constitution.\"  Cash v.  Cty. ofE  rie, 654 F.3d 324, 334 \n(2d Cir. 2011); see also Amnesty Am. v.  Town ofW Hartford, 361 F.3d 113, 126 (2d Cir. 2004) \n(\"[W]here a policymaking official exhibits deliberate indifference to constitutional deprivations \ncaused by subordinates, such that the official's inaction constitutes a 'deliberate choice,' that \nacquiescence may 'be properly thought of as a city \"policy or custom\" that is actionable under ยง \n1983.\"' (citing City ofC  anton v.

The need to act must be \"so obvious\" and the \"inadequacy of the current practices so \nlikely to result in a deprivation of federal rights\" to satisfY the deliberate indifference standard. \nI d. \nA municipality may also be liable under ยง 1983 if a \"final municipal policymaker\" made \na decision that led to the constitutional violation. See Pembaur v. City ofC  incinnati, 475 U.S. \n469, 483 (1986).

Procedural Due Process Claims by Washington and Espinal against the City, \nBrann and Williams (Count 1) \nThe first cause of action is brought pursuant to ยง 1983 by Washington and Espinal \nagainst the City, Brann, and Williams, alleging Defendants violated Washington and Espinal's \nFourteenth Amendment right to procedural due process.  Washington and Espinal claim that they \nwere deprived of their liberty interest of not being subjected to solitary confinement when they \nwere transferred to Albany without notice of the transfer, notice of the reasons for the transfer, or \nan opportunity to be heard. \n1.  Both Plaintiffs Have Properly Pleaded That They Were Deprived of a \nConstitutionally Projected Interest \n\"The Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause protects persons against deprivations \noflife, liberty, or property without due process oflaw, and 'those who seek to invoke its \nprocedural protection must establish that one of these interests is at stake.'\"  Victory v.

To determine whether there is a Fourteenth Amendment \nprocedural due process violation, a court undertakes a two-part analysis: First, it determines \n\"whether there exists a liberty or property interest of which a person has been deprived.\" !d.

The rule says, \"[P]unitive segregation represents a serious threat to the \nphysical and psychological health of adolescents, with respect to whom it should not be \nimposed.\"  40 RCNY atยง l-17(a).  In this vein, the rule mandates that the \"following categories \nof inmates shall be excluded from punitive segregation: (i) inmates under the age of 18; (ii) as of \nJanuary 1, 2016, inmates ages 18 through 21, provided that sufficient resources are made \navailable to the Department for necessary staffing and implementation of necessary alternative \nprogramming;4 and (iii) inmates with serious mental or serious physical disabilities or \nconditions.\" I d.  at ยง l-17(b) (1) (emphasis added).

NY Correctional Dep 't, No. 94 CIV. 5054 (AGS), \n1996 WL 438128, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 2, 1996).  It is a substantive mandate as to how DOC \nmust treat its inmates. \nDefendants argue that any interest created by 40 RCNY ยง 1-17 is limited.  (See City \nDefs.' Br. 10-12.) \nFirst, they contend that 40 RCNY ยง 1-17 is a New York City rule meant to apply to \"the \nDepartment's facilities,\" rather than a rule that permanently vests a liberty interest in any inmate \nwho is held in DOC custody at any point.  See 40 RCNY ยง 1-17 (a) (\"As implemented by the \nDepartment, punitive segregation is a severe penalty that should not be used under certain \ncircumstances in the Department's facilities ....\" ).  It is true that the rule only applies to DOC \nfacilities- the Board's rules can only apply to DOC facilities because the Board has jurisdiction \nover DOC; it has no authority to impose rules on facilities in other counties.  (Am. Compl. -,r 38.) \nBut it is equally obvious that the Board does not enact standards with the mindset that the City \ncan avoid compliance by transferring inmates to other counties, where their special rules have \nnot been adopted, under the trumped-up guise of\"safety considerations.\"  The fact that a state \nlaw permits inmates to be transferred under specified, limited circumstances, does not mean that \nDOC detainees do not have a reasonable expectation that they-who are charged by New York \n31 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 32 of 82\nCity District Attorneys with the violation of city or state law, and who will be tried in New York \nCity comis-will remain at a DOC facility and subject to its rules during their pretrial dentition \n(when they are presumed to be innocent).  To find otherwise would be to say that the Board's \nrules are meaningless and can be circumvented simply by transferring an inmate out of DOC's \njurisdiction - at least for the period of time the inmate is waiting for trial, sentencing, or transfer \nto a state facility.  Such a finding would not be accord with the Board's delegated authority to \noversee DOC. \nDefendants also argue that 40 RCNY ยง 1-17 must coexist with New York State \nCorrection Lawยง 504-and its enabling rules and regulations, including 9 NYCRR ยง 7210.6-\nwhich regulates the transfer of inmates between facilities.  The simple fact that the rule must \nwork alongside state law does not mean that youth held in DOC custody do not have protection \nfrom solitary confinement that is sufficiently definite to create a liberty interest.  This is \nespecially true here, where it is allegedly possible to protect the liberty interest created by the \nNew York City Rule and still comply with Correction Lawยง 504.  For example, an inmate under \nage 22 could be transferred to a facility other than ACCF, which clearly does not meet any of the \ncriteria for transfer in that (1) it does not house young offenders \"in a manner consistent with \napplicable standards\" (including that young detainees cannot be subject to solitary confinement); \n(2) it is anything but \"proximate\" to New York City; (3) it is located in an area where family and \nfriends cannot visit; and ( 4) it seriously restricts the ability of counsel to serve their clients.  (See \n9 NYCRR ยง 7210.6(c).)  Everything in this pleading suggests that the City Defendants are \nvoluntarily and deliberately ignoring these standards-standards that create a liberty interest for \nPlaintiffs while they are at DOC facilities. \n32 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 33 of 82\nFinally, the City Defendants assert that continuing to enforce the ban on ptmitive \nsegregation when an inmate is transferred would undermine the section of9 NYCRR ยง 7210.9, \nwhich says that any inmate transferred \"pursuant to this Pati shall be entitled to all rights and \nprivileges available to other inmates of the receiving facility.\"  But this provision simply sets a \nminimum of rights and privileges to which a transferred inmate is entitled; it does not say that a \ntransferred inmate gives up any additional rights he had at his original facility. \nFor these reasons, the Court finds that Washington and Espinal have alleged a liberty \ninterest in being free from punitive segregation, given that they were originally in DOC custody \nand under the age of 22 at the time of their transfers. \nii.  Deprivation of the Liberty Interest \nWashington and Espinal allege that they were deprived of their liberty interests when \nthey were transferred from DOC facilities to ACCF, where they were placed in punitive \nsegregation for extended periods of time. (Am. Compl. '1['1[180, 278.) \nThe transfer of a pretrial detainee between facilities generally does not implicate due \nprocess.  See Corley v.  City ofN  ew York, No. 1:14-CV-3202-GHW, 2015 WL 5729985, at *7 \n(S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2015).  But here, because the FAC fairly alleges that Washington and \nEspinal were deliberately (and maliciously) transferred from a DOC facility- where they could \nnot be subjected to solitary confinement or extended periods of punishment-to ACCF-where \nthey were subjected to solitary confinement and periods of punishment running into years-the \nact of transferring is directly tied to the deprivation of the right. \niii.  The City's Procedures with Respect to the Deprivation of \nPlaintiffs' Liberty Interest \nTo establish that there was a procedural due process violation for the deprivation of a \nliberty interest, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the Goverrunent's procedures associated with \n33 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 34 of 82\nthe deprivation of the right were not \"constitutionally sufficient.\"  Generally, a plaintiff must \nhave been given \"notice of the case against him and the opportunity to meet it.\"  Spinelli v. City \nofNew York, 579 F.3d 160, 169 (2d Cir. 2009) (citing Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319,348-\n49 (1976)).  However, \"due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the \nparticular situation demands.\" Spinelli, 579 F.3d at 169.  \"In determining what is 'due process' \nin the prison context ... 'one cannot automatically apply procedural rules designed for free \ncitizens in an open society.\"' Hewitt, 459 U.S. at 472 (citing Wolffv. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, \n560 (1974)). \nTo determine whether the State's provided process was constitutionally sufficient, courts \napply a three-part balancing test from Mathews v. Eldridge, which weighs: (1) the private interest \naffected; (2) risk of erroneous deprivation through the procedures applied and the value of \nadditional safeguards; and (3) the government's interest.  See Mathews, 424 U.S. at 335; see also \nHewitt, 459 U.S. 460 (applying Mathews analysis to prisoner's procedural due process claim). \na.  Private Interest \nFirst, the Court considers Plaintiffs' interest in being free from solitary confinement. \nInmates \"held in lawful confinement have their liberty curtailed by definition,\" so the private \ninterest \"must be evaluated ... within the context of the Oail] system and its attendant \ncmiailment of liberties.\"  Wilkinson v. Austin, 545 U.S. 209,225 (2005). \nThe FAC alleges significant harms attendant to prolonged solitary confinement, and its \nabsolutely deleterious effects on young people.  Consistent with these allegations, as well as \nfindings from other courts in this Circuit, the Plaintiffs have successfully pleaded that there is a \nstrong private interest in those aged 21 and younger being free from solitary-particularly those \nymmg pretrial detainees who are presumed to be innocent.  See Proctor v. LeClaire, 846 F.3d \n597, 610 (2d Cir. 2017) (finding private interest implicated by \"extended and indefinite stay\" in \n34 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 35 of 82\nsolitary to be \"weighty\"); A.T. by & through Tillman v. Harder, 298 F. Supp. 3d 391,417 \n(N.D.N.Y. 2018) (\"[P]laintiffs have submitted substantial, convincing evidence that defendants' \ncontinued use of solitary confinement on juveniles puts them at serious risk of short- and long \ntetm psychological damage .. .\" );Brooks v. Terrell, No. CV 10-4009 AKT, 2010 WL 9462575, \nat *11 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 14, 2010) (\"[I]t is well documented that long periods of solitary \nconfinement can have devastating effects on the mental well-being of a detainee.\" (internal \ncitation omitted)); United States v. Basciano, 369 F. Supp. 2d 344, 352 (E.D.N.Y. 2005); see \nalso Davis, 135 S. Ct. 2187 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (recognizing that prolonged solitary can \nexact a \"tenible price\"). \nMoreover, here, it is telling that the Board passed 40 RCNY ยง 1-17, forbidding punitive \nsegregation for specified inmates and for extended periods of time, thereby creating Plaintiffs' \ninterests.  Presumably, the Board determined that the potential harms of such confinement to \nPlaintiffs and others similarly situated were great enough to wanant changes in procedures in the \njail system.  The Court agrees, and finds that Plaintiffs' interest is strong.  This factor favors \nPlaintiffs. \nb.  Risk ofEnoneous Deprivation \nThe second factor involves an examination of the procedures applied at the time of the \ndeprivation.  A pre-deprivation hearing is usually required to satisfY due process requirements, \nalthough post-deprivation process can be sufficient in certain circumstances.  See Spinelli, 579 \nF. 3d at 170.  \"[N]ecessity of quick action by the State or the impracticality of providing any \nmeaningful pre[ -]deprivation process, when coupled with the availability of some meaningful \nmeans by which to assess the propriety of the State's action at some time after the initial taking, \ncan satisfy the requirements of procedural due process.\"  Id. (quoting Catanzaro v.  Weiden,  188 \n35 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 36 of 82\nF.3d 56, 61 (2d Cir. 1999)).5  For example, in Spinelli v. City ofN  ew York, the Second Circuit \nfound that a pre-deprivation hearing was not required when a gun dealer's license was suspended \nbecause (l) the City and the public had a strong interest in security, and (2) the deprivation of \nrights was taken pursuant to the proper authority, in accordance with the designated mles and \nprocedures.  Id. \nBoth Plaintiffs have alleged that they did not receive sufficient notice of their transfer \nprior to being transferred to Albany, and that post-deprivation process (which they did not \nreceive in any event) would be insufficient.  (Am. Compl. ~~ 138, 213.)  The City Defendants \nargue that the FAC alleges \"exigent circumstances\" justifying post-deprivation process, \nparticularly with respect to Espinal, who was transferred after allegedly assaulting a member of \nthe Rikers staff.  (See City Defs.' Br. at 2; Defs.' Mem. of Law in Further Supp. of Mot. to \nDismiss and/or for Order Joining State Commissions of Correction as Def. (\"City Defs.' Reply \nBr.\"), Dkt. No. 75, at 3.)  Furthermore, they argue that both Plaintiffs had post-deprivation \nprocess by virtue of \"written notification of reasons for the transfer,\" and therefore, this not a \ncircumstance in which there was a \"total absence of process.\"  Cf JS.R. ex rel JS.G. v. Sessions, \n330 F. Supp. 3d 731,741-42 (D. Conn. 2018). \nThe first question for the Court is whether post- deprivation process - if it were provided \n(which it was not)-would be sufficient for each inmate as a matter oflaw, given the \ncircumstances surrounding that particular inmate's transfer.  According to the SJOs, Plaintiffs \n5 Plaintiffs argue that post-deprivation remedies can suffice only for \"random, unauthorized acts by state \nemployees.\" Hellenic Am. Neighborhood Action Comm. v. City ofN  ew York, 101 F.3d 877, 880 (2d Cir. 1996). But \nthe Hellenic court stated that, \"When the deprivation occurs in the more structured environment of established state \nprocedures, rather than random acts, the availability of postdeprivation procedures will not, ipso facto, satisfy due \nprocess;\" it did not say that post-deprivation procedures can never satisfy due process. Id. (emphasis added).  Post \ndeprivation procedures can be sufficient when there is the \"necessity of the quick action of the state.\"  Parratt v. \nTaylor, 451 U.S. 527, 539 (1981), overruled on other grounds by Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327 (1986); see also \nSpinelli, 579 F.3d at 170. \n36 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 37 of 82\nwere transferred because of \"safety considerations\" and because the DOC facilities were \"unfit\" \nfor their confinement.  (Zuckerman Dec!. Exs. C-F.)  Comis give strong deference to safety \nconcerns with respect to jail conditions.  See, e.g., Bell v.  Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 547-48 (1979); \nHewitt, 459 U.S. at 474 (\"[A] decision that an inmate or group of inmates represents a threat to \nthe institution's security would not be appreciably fostered by the trial-type procedural \nsafeguards ....\" ). \n1.  Washington \nDespite the fact that Washington's SJO says that he was transferred for \"safety \nconsiderations,\" the FAC alleges no facts surrounding Washington's transfer that suggest \n\"exigent circumstances\" that would wanยทant forgoing pre-deprivation process.  There are no \nallegations in the FAC that suggest that Washington was involved in any altercations prior to his \ntransfer.  Rather, the F AC alleges that he was transferred because Legal Aid contacted DOC on \nhis behalf, after he informed them that he was groped by a DOC staff member and denied \nadequate health care.  (Am. Compl. 4jl30.)  In other words, the allegation is that he was \ntransferred because he complained about mistreatment- as is his right.  The City Defendants do \nnot explain why Washington's making a complaint creates a \"safety consideration\" that would \nWatTant Washington's transfer, and why there were \"exigent circumstances\" that would prevent \nhim from receiving pre-transfer process. 6  Based on the allegations made in the FAC, \nWashington should have received pre-deprivation process. \nBut Washington has alleged that he did not receive sufficient pre-deprivation process. \nThe only notice Washington received was second-hand.  As he was being strip-searched, the step \n6 The City Defendants also do not contend that it would be difficult to provide pre-deprivation notice. \nMoreover, factual allegations suggest that it would be administratively feasible:  In 2017, the New York City \nCouncil introduced a bill to amend the New York City Administrative Code to provide detainees with additional \nnotice before transferring them out ofthe City by SJO.  (Am. Compl. ~57 n.25.) \n37 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 38 of 82\nprior to loading him into the van to take him to Albany, Washington was told that he was going \nto \"Albany because Deputy Walker don't want you.\"  (Am. Compl. ~ 136.)  This off-handed \ncomment is not adequate notice-Washington was given no official explanation for his transfer, \nincluding the reasons that DOC provided to the SCOC, which was that Washington was \ntransfened for safety concerns.  Upon his arrival in Albany, Washington was also not provided \nwith notice ofthe reasons for the transfer, as the City Defendants suggest.  (!d. ~ 489.)  He was \nnever given a hearing or an opportunity to challenge his transfer.  If the FAC is believed, he was \nsimply put into solitary after being beaten to a pulp. \nWashington has, therefore, sufficiently alleged that post-deprivation process was \ninadequate and this factor of the Mathews test favors him.  Furthermore, even if the F AC had \nalleged facts pointing to \"exigent circumstances\" sunounding Washington's transfer, wananting \nlack of a pre-deprivation hearing, Washington has also alleged that he also did not receive post \ndeprivation notice, so this factor would still favor him. \n2.  Espinal \nThe FAC's allegations about Espinal's transfers do contain facts that the transfer was \nmade under \"exigent circumstances.\" Espinal was transfened from Rikers three days after his \naltercation with the COs.  (Am. Compl. ~~ 203-04, 210.)  From this, the Comi can infer that \nDOC may have needed to take quick action to ensure the safety of inmates, including Espinal, \nand that pre-deprivation process may not have been constitutionally required. \nBut there is one other thing to consider before coming to any conclusions.  In Spinelli, the \ncourt found that the State's failure to provide pre-deprivation process may be constitutional when \nthere are exigent circumstances and when the State followed appropriate rules and procedures \nwhen depriving the individual of his rights.  See Spinelli, 579 F.3d at 171 (finding pre \ndeprivation due process was not required when there were exigent circumstances and all rules \n38 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 39 of 82\nwere followed); see also United States v. All Assets ofS tatewide Auto Parts, Inc., 971 F.2d 896, \n903 (2d Cir. 1992) (following judicial procedures can afford some measure of protection for \netToneous deprivation of property).  Here, the F AC alleges that the City did not follow the \nprocedures required to authorize Espinal's transfer.  Written correspondence is required to \nauthorize a transfer on an emergency basis, and Plaintiffs allege that they have no knowledge of \nwritten correspondence from the City to the SCOC.  (Am. Compl. ~~56, 225.) \nIn any regard, even if the City followed appropriate procedures and the circumstances did \nnot warrant pre-deprivation process, Espinal still had a right to post-deprivation process.  Post \ndeprivation procedures should have included notice of the reasoning for the transfer and an \nopportunity to file an Article 78 petition challenging the transfer, which would satisfy the \nrequirement of notice and the opportunity to be heard.  See, e.g., Hellenic Am. Neighborhood \nAction Comm. v.  City ofN  ew York, 101 F. 3d 877, 881 (2d Cir. 1996).  Indeed, 9 NYCRR \nยง 7210.8 requires that \"the facility administrator of the receiving facility shall provide him \nimmediately with a written notification of the reasons for his transfer.\"  Id  The F AC alleges that \nEspinal did not receive notice of the reasons for the transfer at all, even upon his arrival at \nACCF.  (Am. Compl. ~ 489.)  This is sufficient to raise a due process concern, even if Espinal in \nfact had access to the Article 78 proceeding, an opportunity to be heard.  See McCann v. Phillips, \n864 F. Supp. 330, 339 (S.D.N.Y. 1994) (\"The essence of the Due Process Clause is the principle \nthat a person deprived of a protected liberty interest receive notice ofthe reason for, and some \nopportunity to be heard with respect to, that deprivation.\").  Moreover, Espinal's beating and \ndetention in solitary may well have interfered with his ability to file an Article 78 proceeding \nsomething this Court cannot address on a pre-answer motion to dismiss. \n39 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 40 of 82\nBecause Espinal has sufficiently alleged that he did not receive sufficient process, this \nfactor favors him as well. \nc.  The Govemment's Interest \nThe third factor in the Mathews analysis is the Govemment's interest.  The Court must \nweigh \"the Govemment' s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and \nadministrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.\" \nMathews, 424 U.S. at 335. \nCourts continually recognize that the Govemment has an important interest in \nmaintaining the safety and security of jail facilities and inmates in its custody.  As the Supreme \nCourt has said, \"The safety of the institution's guards and inmates is perhaps the most \nfundamental responsibility of the prison administration.\"  Hewitt, 459 U.S. at 473.  Nevertheless, \nwhile \"prison officials are to be afforded deference in matters of institutional security, such \ndeference does not relieve officials from the requirements of due process ... \" Almighty Supreme \nBorn Allah v. Milling, 876 F.3d 48, 56 (2d Cir. 2017), cert. dismissed, 139 S. Ct. 49 (2018). \nThe relevant inquiry here is whether the City had an interest in not providing adequate \nprocess to Plaintiffs, whether that be pre-deprivation or post-deprivation.  See Spinelli, 579 F.3d \nat 174. \nThe Court sees no reason why the Government could not have provided Washington with \nnotice and an opportunity to be heard prior to his transfer (or even after his transfer for that \nmatter).  None of the allegations in the FAC suggests that Washington's transfer needed to occur \nquickly, and without any notice to the Plaintiff.  This factor favors Washington. \nThe FAC also contains no allegations that would suggest that there was a reason why \nEspinal did not receive notice of the reason for his transfer after his transfer.  Even though the \nGovemment has a strong interest in the safety and security of the jail facilities, this does not \n40 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 41 of 82\npreclude it from providing notice of the reasons for a transfer.  Indeed, notice is required by state \nlaw, which requires that the administrator of the receiving jail provide immediate notification of \nthe reasons for the transfer.  This factor also favors Espinal. \nd.  Analysis \nBalancing the Mathews factors, the Court finds that Washington and Espinal have alleged \na procedural due process violation. The State has a strong interest in the safety of the inmate and \nthe jail facilities, and Courts generally defer to the State's reliance on this fact when considering \nwhat due process is owed.  But that does not excuse a failure to provide any notice of the reasons \nfor depriving Plaintiffs of their rights, which is what is alleged to have occuned here for both \nPlaintiffs (notably, in violation of state law).  Accordingly, because the FAC alleges that \nPlaintiffs received no notice of the reasoning for their transfer, Plaintiffs have successfully \nalleged that the process was not \"constitutionally sufficient.\" \nSince Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged procedural due process violations, I tum to \nwhether the City, Brann, and Williams can be held liable for these violations. \n2.  The City, Brann, and Williams are Proper ยง 1983 Defendants \nThe City Defendants first argue that they cannot be held liable for transfenยทing Plaintiffs \nto Albany because the transfers were taken pursuant to SJOs issued by the SCOC, and the SCOC \nalone should be held responsible for the transfer. \nHowever, the Court will not permit the City Defendants to avoid liability for their role in \nthe transfer by pawning it off to the SCOC (as they try to do consistently throughout their brief). \nAs Plaintiffs have outlined for the Court, it is clear that both in theory and in practice, the City \nDefendants are the driving force behind the transfer process and so can be held liable for their \nactions.  Indeed, the SCOC appears to be nothing more than a mbber stamp for the Facility \nAdministrator's \"recommendation.\" \n41 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 42 of 82\nA ยง 1983 action, like its state tort analogs, employs the principle of proximate causation. \nTownes v. City ofN  ew York, 176 F.3d 138, 146 (2d Cir. 1999).  \"[T]ort defendants, including \nthose sued under ยง 1983, are 'responsible for the natural consequences of [their] actions.\"' \nKerman v. City ofN  ew York, 374 F.3d 93, 126 (2d Cir. 2004) (quoting Warner v.  Orange Cty. \nDep 't ofP  robation, 115 F. 3d 1068, 1071 (2d Cir. 1991)).  \"The fact that the intervening third \nparty may exercise independent judgment in detennining whether to follow a course of action \nrecommended by the defendant does not make acceptance of the recommendation unforeseeable \nor relieve the defendant of responsibility.\"  Id. at 127. \nThe procedures described by 9 NYCRR ยง 7210.6 and the practices discussed in \nDefendant Williams' affidavit confirm that the City is the driving force behind the uยทansfers.  It is \ntrue that the SCOC approves the request, but there is nothing to suggest that the SCOC does any \nmore than rubber stamp any request submitted by the City.  See id. at 126 (\"[A]n actor may be \nheld liable for those consequences attributable to reasonably foreseeable intervening forces, \nincluding the acts of third parties.\") (quoting Warner, 115 F.3d at 1071)).  Neither party has \nargued that SJOs are ever denied or that there is any rigor to the approval process.  The City \nDefendants make the recommendation for transfer and handle the majority of the logistics in \npreparation and implementation; thus, they cannot escape liability for the expected result of these \nactions. \nI now tum to whether Plaintiffs have pleaded facts showing that these three defendants \nwere sufficiently involved in Plaintiffs' alleged constitutional deprivation. \ni.  Individual Liability \nWashington and Espinal have pleaded facts showing that both Williams and Brann had \npersonal involvement in their transfers and thus, directly participated in the alleged constitutional \nviolation.  Williams obtained the SJOs transferring Washington and Espinal to ACCF.  (Am. \n42 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 43 of 82\nCompl. ~~ 139, 227; Zuckerman Dec!. Exs. C & D.)  And Brann, as the facility administrator, \nformally applied to the SCOC to issue the SJOs.  (!d. ~ 54; Zuckerman Dec!. Exs. C & D.) It is \nclear that they both were personally involved in the transfer, which is directly related to the \nalleged constitutional violation.  See Farid v. Ellen, 593 F.3d 233, 249 (2d Cir. 201 0). \nii.  Municipal Liability \nWashington and Espinal have also pleaded facts to establish that the City can be held \nliable for the constitutional deprivation under a Monell theory of liability.  Plaintiff proposes two \ntheories of municipal liability. \nFirst, Plaintiffs allege that the City has a policy or custom of transferring inmates, who \nare otherwise subjected to 40 RCNY ยง l-17, out of DOC custody and into facilities where they \nwill be subjected to the punitive measures and violence- and of doing so without providing \nnotice.  The FAC alleges that not only were both Washington and Espinal transfened without \nnotice, but so were Tillery and Doe.  (Am. Compl. ~~ 138,213,322, 413.)  The FAC also alleges \nthat these are not the only four young detainees who have been so transfened.  (!d.  'j!~ 470-78.) \nTaking these allegations in a light most favorable to Plaintiffs, the Court can infer that the City \nhas a custom of transferring these young inmates to ACCF without notice, which is sufficient to \nestablish Monell liability.  See also Bertuglia v.  City ofN  ew York, 839 F. Supp. 2d 703,738 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2012) (denying motion to dismiss when plaintiffs pointed to specific cases of alleged \npolicy and practice occuning); cf Triano v. Town ofH  arrison, NY, 895 F. Supp. 2d 526, 536 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2012) (granting motion to dismiss when plaintiff failed to identifY any details about \nother instances of misconduct for failure to allege municipal policy or practice). \nPlaintiffs also argue that the City is liable under Monell because Brann is a \"final \nmunicipal policyrnaker,\" and she acted in that capacity when requesting the SJOs pursuant to \nstate law.  Pursuant to Corrections Law ยง 504 and 9 NYCRR ยง 7210.6, the facility administrator \n43 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 44 of 82\nprovides the SCOC with the request and pertinent information for an SJO to be issued and the \nSCOC then approves the transfer request.  Taking all allegations in a light most favorable to \nPlaintiffs, on a motion to dismiss, the Court finds that it is possible that Brann could be a \"final \nmunicipal policymaker\" because she ultimately makes the final decision as to whether detainees' \ntransfer requests are submitted to the SCOC.  See Gersbacher, 2017 WL 4402538, at *17 \n(describing relevant materials to consider when detetmining whether an official is a final \nmunicipal policymaker, including \"custom or usage\" and state and city laws). \nThe Motion to Dismiss the first cause of action is DENIED. \nC.  Substantive Due Process Claims by All Plaintiffs Against the City, Brann, \nand Williams; by Washington Against Walker; and by Doe Against Sullivan \n(Count2) \nIn the second cause of action, all Plaintiffs bring substantive due process claims against \nthe City, Brann, and Williams pursuant toยง 1983.  Plaintiffs allege Defendants City, Brann, and \nWilliams transferred Plaintiffs outside of the City for the purpose of punishing them.  Plaintiff \nWashington also brings this claim against Defendant Walker, and Plaintiff Doe brings this claim \nagainst Defendant Sullivan. \n1.  Each Plaintiff Has Plausibly Alleged He Was Transferred As \nPunishment \nPretrial detainees have a due process right to be free from punishment - they cannot be \nsubject to punishment \"neither cmelly and unusually nor otherwise.\"  Darnell v. Pineiro, 849 F. \n3d 17, 29 (2d Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted).  One form of punishment is punitive \ntransfers- correction officials may not use inter-facility transfers to punish a pretrial detainee. \nSee, e.g., Perez v. Ponte, 236 F. Supp. 3d 590, 615 (E.D.N.Y. 2017), report and recommendation \nadopted, No. 16-CV-645 (JFB)(AKT), 2017 WL 1050109 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 15, 2017). \n44 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 45 of 82\nPunitive purpose can be proven subjectively or objectively.  See Kingsley v. Hendrickson, \n135 S. Ct. 2466,2473 (2015), see also Darnell, 849 F.3d at 35 (\"[T]he Due Process Clause can \nbe violated when an official does not have subjective awareness that the official's acts (or \nomissions) have subjected the pretrial detainee to a substantial risk of harm.\").  If a condition or \nrestriction \"is not reasonably related to a legitimate governmental objective-if it is arbitrary or \npurposeless-a comi permissibly may infer that the purpose of the governmental action is \npunishment that may not constitutionally be inflicted.\" Bell, 441 U.S. at 539. \nTo survive a motion to dismiss, each Plaintiff must allege that his transfer was \"imposed \nfor the purpose of punishment,\" and that it was not just \"an incident of some other legitimate \ngovernmental purpose.\"  Bell, 441 U.S. at 538; see also Kingsley, 135 S. Ct. at 2473. \nThe City Defendants argue that the substantive due process claim must be dismissed \nbecause there is no indication of expressed intent to punish any Plaintiff by any City Defendant \nby virtue of application to SJOs.  They also argue that the City Defendants cannot be held liable \nfor Plaintiffs' transfers because the transfers were made by the SCOC.  (City Defs.' Br. at 14-\n15.) \nI first tum to whether each Plaintiff has alleged that his transfer was taken for the purpose \nof punishment. \n1.  Washington \nPlaintiffs contend that Washington was directly informed that he was being transferred as \npunishment.  The FAC states that COs told Washington that he was being taken \"OffRikers\" \nbecause \"Deputy Walker don't [sic] want you.\"  (Am. Compl. ~ 136.) Taking this allegation in a \nlight most favorable to Plaintiff, the Court can infer that Washington could have been transferred \nbecause he was not liked by a Rikers CO, an arbitrary reason that is not reasonably related to a \ngovernment objective.  See Perez, 236 F. Supp. 3d at 616 (finding fact that CO told Plaintiff that \n45 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 46 of 82\nhe was going to get treated like an \"a**hole\" and would be sent \"far away where you won't be \nable to complain\" sufficient to find transfer could have taken place with the intent to punish). \nThe Court can also infer that Washington's transfer was punitive because Washington \nwas transferred within days of complaints being lodged with DOC on his behalf.  This quick \ntime line suggests that the purpose of the transfer was punishment for complaining (which, of \ncourse, is retaliation, and is discussed in the context of Washington's First Amendment \nretaliation claim). \nii.  Doe \nSimilarly, Plaintiffs argue that Defendant Sullivan's statement to Doe demonstrates that \nDoe's transfer was punitive.  Defendant Sullivan told Doe, \"Soon enough we won't have to deal \nwith your bullshit anymore.  You're going somewhere good, somewhere that you'll like.\"  (Id. -,r \n319.)  Drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of Plaintiffs, the Court can infer that Doe was \nalso transferred to Rikers because he had drawn the ire of Rikers COs. \niii. Espinal and Tillery \nWith respect to Espinal and Tillery, Plaintiffs recognize that their alleged assaults on staff \n\"could have provided a legitimate safety justification for their transfer,\" but contend that this \njustification was in fact pretextual.  (Pis.' Consolidated Mem. of Law in Further Supp. of Steven \nEspinal's Mot. for a Prelim. Inj. and in Opp. to the New York City Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss (Pis.' \nBr.), Dkt. No. 63, at 17.) \nIn the alternative, they challenge the City's purported reason for transfening the \nPlaintiffs: Plaintiffs' own safety.  The FAC cites to Mayor Bill de Blasio's statement that, \n\"Occasionally we have to remove a prisoner from our conection system because there is an \nimmediate threat to them and something that requires them being moved to another jurisdiction,\" \nas well as the August 2018 letter from DOC to Espinal's attorney in which the City said that \n46 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 47 of 82\nEspinal was transfenยทed for his (Espinal's) continued safety and security.  (Am. Compl. 'if'! 65, \n206; Rosenfeld Dec!. Ex. 19.)  Plaintiffs argue that transferring an inmate to protect him from \nviolence by a jail's staff cannot constitute a legitimate govennnental purpose.  Since the Court \nfinds that Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged punitive intent, it is not necessary at this stage to \ndetermine whether transferring an inmate to protect him from the ire of the jail's staff is a \n\"legitimate purpose,\" although the Court does note that these allegations suggest that there was \nintense animosity toward Plaintiffs by Rikers COs, which fmiher supports an inference of \npunitive intent for the transfers. \nSeveral allegations in the FAC point to an inference that the City's justification for the \ntransfers was pretextual, and that Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged punitive intent. \nFirst, the transfers of Espinal and Tillery are alleged to have occurred quickly after these \nPlaintiffs were allegedly involved in altercations with staff.  Taking this allegation in a light most \nfavorable to Plaintiffs, this timeline suppmis an inference that the transfers were a punitive \nresponse to the incident.  Of course, this could cut both ways -the transfer could have been \nbecause jail staff legitimately deemed their presence in the jail to be a threat to safety and \nsecurity of the institution-but a motion to dismiss is not the place to make a choice between two \nplausible inferences. \nSecond, the FAC alleges that the City's use ofSJOs for \"safety\" or \"security\" reasons has \nincreased since the passage of the ban on solitary confinement, and the number of detainees \nunder the age of 22 transferred for these purposes has doubled.  (Am. Comp l. 'if'! 61-62.)  Taking \nthis fact in a light most favorable to Plaintiffs, it suggests that the increase in these SJOs is the \nresult of the ban on solitary confinement, and demonstrates an intent to circumvent the regulation \nin order to punish inmates. \n47 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 48 of 82\nThird, at the time of Washington and Tillery's transfers, Defendants are alleged to have \nbeen on notice of the abuses taking place in Albany, yet continued to transfer detainees there. \n(Am. Compl. ~~ 105-10.)  Moreover, Defendant Williams said in a November 2018 affidavit in \nan unrelated Article 78 proceeding that, only ACCF has shown a \"unique willingness\" to accept \ntransfened inmates with \"violent infraction histories,\" indicating that he may have had \nknowledge that transfened inmates were being subjected to punitive treatment at ACCF.  (Am. \nCompl. ~ 112; Pis.' Br. at 20-21.)  Taken together, these allegations suggest the City was aware \nof what was going on at ACCF and transfened Plaintiffs anyway. \nFourth, Plaintiffs allege that inmates are sent to ACCF, despite the fact that the DOC has \nample tools to isolate and control detainees, who can be placed in Enhanced Supervision \nHousing or restrictive housing at West Facility.  (Am. Compl. ~~ 47-50.)  They argue that this \nsupports their assertion that safety was not the underlying motivation for the transfer. \nFinally, Plaintiffs allege that Tillery was returned to Rikers less than four weeks after \nPlaintiffs commenced this lawsuit.  (Id. ~ 467.)  He was not told why he was transfened back to \nRikers.  (Id.  at~ 468.)  Plaintiffs argue that this suggests that any initial justifications that he \ncould not be housed inNe w York County because of \"safety\" were pretextual. \nConsidering these allegations together in a light most favorable to Plaintiffs, it is clear \nthat Plaintiffs sufficiently allege facts that support a plausible inference of punitive intent on \nbehalf of the City Defendants.  Plaintiffs have alleged facts to support an inference that these \ntransfers were unnecessary for safety reasons, that they were part of a pattern of pretextual \ntransfers taken in response to the solitary confinement ban, and that, at least with respect to \nWashington and Tillery, the transfers were taken despite the fact that they were on notice of \n48 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 49 of 82\ninhumane treatment at ACCF.  This is sufficient for the Court to infer that, at the pre-answer \nstage, all Plaintiffs, including Espinal and Tillery, were transferred with punitive intent. \nI now tum to whether Defendants City, Brann, Williams, Sullivan, and Walker can be \nheld liable for the punitive transfers. \n2.  Plaintiffs Have Plausibly Alleged that Defendants City, Brann, \nWilliams, Walker, and Sullivan are Properยง 1983 Defendants \nThe City Defendants contend that the City, Brann, Williams, Walker, and Sullivan cannot \nbe held responsible for the transfers, implying that they cannot be held responsible for any \nconstitutional deprivation related to the transfer because of a lack of involvement in the transfer, \n(although they fail to make this connection in their brief).  (City Defs.' Br. at 14-15.)  They \nfurther argue that, even if the City Defendants can be held responsible for the transfers, the \nSCOC exercised independent judgment and therefore was an \"intervening factor\" that destroys \nthe chain of causation.  (City Defs.' Reply Br. at 4-5.) \nFor reasons I have already discussed, I find the City Defendants' attempt to avoid \nliability for their role in the transfer uncompelling.  The City Defendants can be held liable for \nconstitutional violations related to the transfers, despite the fact that the SJOs are apparently \nroutinely approved by the SCOC. \ni.  Individual Defendants \nPlaintiffs have established that Williams and Brann were personally involved in the each \none of Plaintiffs' transfers, and can be held liable nnder ยง 1983.  As I have already addressed, \nPlaintiffs have alleged that Brann and Williams were the driving force behind the applications to \nthe SCOC and instrumental in obtaining the transfers; therefore, they can be held liable for \nviolations related to these transfers.  (See infra II.B.2.i; Zuckerman Exs. C-F.) \n49 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 50 of 82\nThere are two additional individual Defendants on this claim. Washington brings a claim \nagainst Defendant Walker, and Doe brings a claim against Defendant Sullivan. \nWashington alleges that COs told him that he was being transferred to Albany because \n\"Deputy Walker don't want you.\"  (Am. Compl. ~ 136.)  This statement is sufficient for the \nCourt to infer that Defendant Walker played a role in securing Washington's transfer, as it \nalleges that Walker was the driving force behind the transfer. \nDoe alleges that, one day prior to his transfer to Albany, Defendant Sullivan told him, \n\"Soon enough we won't have to deal with your bullshit anymore.  You're going somewhere \ngood that you'll like.\"  (!d.~ 319.)  Taking this fact in a light most favorable to Plaintiff, the \nCourt can infer that Defendant Sullivan had a role in driving or enforcing the transfer, which \nwould be sufficient forยง 1983 liability.  See Terebesi v.  Torreso, 764 F.3d 217,234 (2d Cir. \n2014) (\"In this Circuit, a 'direct participant' includes a person who authorizes, orders, or helps \nothers to do the unlawful acts, even if he or she does not commit the acts personally.\")  At the \nvery least, it is premature to dismiss the claim against Sullivan in a motion to dismiss. \nii.  Municipal Liability \nPlaintiffs argue that the City can be held liable because it has an unconstitutional policy \nor custom of transferring detainees to Albany in order to punish them.  As the earlier analysis of \nthe substantive due process claim recognizes, the FAC contains allegations that support four \nseparate instances where young detainees were transferred to Albany for the purposes of \npunishment.  Cf T.P. ex rei. Patterson v. Elmsford Union Free Sch. Dist., No. 11 CV 5133 VB, \n2012 WL 5992748, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 27, 2012) (finding a single instance of misconduct \ninsufficient to support allegations of policy or custom).  In addition, Plaintiffs have alleged that, \nsince the ban on solitary confinement for younger detainees went into effect, their transfer \nupstate has increased dramatically.  (Am. Compl. ~~ 60-61.)  The Court can reasonably infer \n50 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 51 of 82\nfrom this fact that young detainees are being transfened to Albany so that they can receive \npunishment they could not receive at a DOC facility.  This is not a legitimate reason for transfer. \nAccordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have successfully alleged Monel/liability against the \nCity for the punitive transfers. \nThe Motion to Dismiss the second cause of action is DENIED. \nD.  Plaintiffs' Individual Causes of Action Against the City for Excessive Force, \nSexual Assault, and Unreasonable Search (Counts 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 17, 21, 22, \n23 & 27) \nEach Plaintiff brings multiple claims against the City related to individual constitutional \nviolations he suffered upon his anival in Albany.  Plaintiffs argue that the City is liable for each \nof these claims because the City has a policy or custom of transfening inmates - particularly \nthose under 22-to Albany, with the \"knowledge and expectation\" that these inmates will be \nsubjected to sexual assault, unreasonable manual body cavity searches, excessive and unlawful \nforce, and violent torture in violation of their constitutional rights.  (See Am. Compl. ~~ 508, \n514,520,525,534,540,546,551,576,591,596,602,607,622,627.) \nWashington brings claims of excessive force (count 4), sexual assault (count 5), and \nunreasonable search (count 6).  Espinal brings claims of excessive force (count 9), sexual assault \n(count 1 0), unreasonable search (count 11 ), and an additional claim of excessive force related to \nhis July 4 incident (count 17).  Doe brings claims of excessive force (count 21 ), sexual assault \n(count 22), and unreasonable search (count 23).  Finally, Tillery brings an excessive force claim \n(count 27). \nThe City Defendants make three main arguments as to why all of these claims should be \ndismissed.  First, they argue that the SCOC, not the City, was responsible for the transfers. \nSecond, they argue that Plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged that the City knew of these abuses, \nsuch that any policy of transfers was taken with the knowledge and expectation that they would \n51 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 52 of 82\nbe subject to abuse.  Third, they argue that there is no causal connection between the City's \naction and the deprivation of constitutional rights.  (City Defs.' Br. at 18-19.) \nTwice now I have addressed and rejected the City's first argument: the City can be held \nresponsible for the transfers.  (See infra II.B.2.ii; II.C.2.ii.) \nThus, I turn to the City's second argument-that Plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged that \nthe City had a policy of transferring detainees to Albany with the knowledge that they would be \nsubject to abuse. \nPlaintiffs argue that the City has failed to act to stop these transfers, despite the fact that \nRikers detainees have repeatedly informed the City that ACCF guards abuse Rikers detainees \nupon their arrival in Albany.  Indeed, Plaintiffs allege that the City continues to consistently send \nyoung detainees to ACCF, as demonstrated by the increase in the transfer rate.  (Pis.' Br. at 21-\n22.) \nTo succeed on their claims, Plaintiffs must allege that the City policymakers who \"speak \nwith final policymaking authority ... concerning the action alleged to have caused the particular \nconstitutional violation at issue\" knew of the abuses in Albany at the time Plaintiffs were \ntransferred.  Jett, 491 U.S. at 737.  Plaintiffs cannot show that the City was deliberately \nindifferent to what was occurring in Albany unless City officials knew what was occurring in \nAlbany.  See Reynolds, 506 F.3d at 192 (\"Monell's policy or custom requirement is satisfied \nwhere a local government is faced with a pattern of misconduct and does nothing, compelling the \nconclusion that the local government has acquiesced in or tacitly authorized its subordinates' \nunlawful actions.\"); Vann v. City ofN  ew York, 72 F.3d 1040, 1049 (2d Cir. 1995). \nTo establish that the City lmew of the misconduct, Plaintiffs point to the cumulative \neffect of the following alleged facts: a February 16, 2018letter from a criminal defense attorney \n52 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 53 of 82\nto DOC's general counsel explaining that his client had been beaten upon arrival at ACCF; \nEspinal's March 3, 2018 Notice of Claim; an Aprill2, 2018 Article 78 petition challenging an \ninmate's transfer to ACCF and alleging that the inmate was beaten and sexually assaulted upon \narrival in Albany; a July 2018letter from Ruben Fernandez (Espinal's defense counsel) to Brann \nexplaining that Espinal had been subject to beatings and mistreatment at ACCF; a July 22, 2018 \nNew York Times articles describing the treatment ofRikers detainees at ACCF;  and, an October \n31, 2018 Article 78 petition in which a detainee alleges he experienced assault without any \nprovocation upon his arrival in Albany.  (Am. Compl. ~~ 10 6-111.) \nDoe was transferred to Albany on January 17, 2018; Espinal was transferred on February \n13, 2018.  (See id. ~~ 210, 321, 324.).  It is true that earliest form of official notice to the City \nthat is identified in the Complaint-the February 16, 2018 letter- occurred shortly after Doe and \nEspinal had been transfeJTed. \nNevertheless, on a motion to dismiss, taking all allegations in favor of Plaintiffs, the \nCourt cannot conclude that the City did not have knowledge of what was going on in Albany \nprior to transferring Doe and Espinal because Plaintiffs have alleged that Defendant Williams -\nwho procured Plaintiffs' SJOs, as well as SJOs transferring other pretrial detainees-allegedly \nhad knowledge of the abuses in Albany, but continuously requested the SJOs anyway. \nDefendant Williams stated in an affidavit in an umelated Article 78 proceeding that \"only \nAlbany County Conยทectional Facility would be willing to house [inmates with histories of \ninfections and violence], due to the facility's willingness in the past to accept and house inmates \nwith similar violent infraction histories\" and that he \"believed\" that no other closer jail would be \n\"equipped to house and supervise dangerous, violent inmates.\"  (Williams Aff. ,1~ 8-9.)  Taking \nthis statement in a light most favorable to Plaintiffs, the Court can infer that Williams \n53 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 54 of 82\nconsistently sent a subgroup of pretrial detainees to ACCF, detainees who were purportedly \ndifficult to manage, without fully considering whether other facilities might house these inmates, \nand that it is very likely that he knew (and supported) what was being done at ACCF to \n\"manage\" these individuals.  (Williams Aff. ~~5-6, 9.)  Until the facts about what Williams \nknew and considered in each instance are developed, I cannot discount the possibility that \nWilliams would have been able to house inmates at facilities closer to New York City, where \nthere was no history of violent reception in the presence of DOC officers- all of which would \nhave been more consistent with the letter and spirit of the regulation than sending them to ACCF \nwas. \nMoreover, since the FAC suggests that Williams makes the decisions about whether to \napply for the transfers, I cannot reach a conclusion about whether Williams' knowledge could or \ncould not be attributed to the City or that he did not communicate what he knew to others, such \nas Brann.  See Bektic-Marrero v. Goldberg, 850 F. Supp. 2d 418,431 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (denying \nmotion to dismiss Monell claim when \"high-ranking prison officials\" were aware ofDOJ report \ndetailing systemic constitutional failures similar to plaintiffs claim). \nFurthermore, specifically with respect to Washington and Tillery, it is clear that the City \nhad received formal notice such that it was \"faced with a pattern of misconduct\" as required for a \ndeliberate indifference claim.  Reynolds, 506 F. 3d at 192.  At the time of Washington's transfer, \nhigh-ranking City officials had two fmms of notice, the February 16, 2018letter and Espinal's \nMarch 3, 2018 Notice of Claim.  By the time of Tillery's transfer on August 9, 2018, not only \nhad the City received multiple individual complaints-directed at Brann, who was responsible \nfor requesting the transfers-but a story had run in the New York Times, on which the Mayor's \noffice commented.  (Am. Compl. ~~ 61, 65.)  Defendant Tillery was sent to ACCF three weeks \n54 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 55 of 82\nafter the article was published.  Taking these allegations in a light most favorable to Plaintiffs, \nthey are sufficient for the Court to find that at the time of Washington and Tillery's transfers, the \nCity could have been on notice that their transferred inmates would be abused See Okin v.  Viii. \nofC  ornwall-On-Hudson Police Dep 't, 577 F.3d 415, 440 (2d Cir. 2009) (finding \"consistent \npattern of failing to adequately respond to [] complaints\" and failing to act lawfully sufficient \nwas sufficient basis for Monell claim). \nAs to the City's third argument, Plaintiffs have also sufficiently pled causation.  In the \ncontext of Monel/liability, \"proximate cause\" \"fairly describes a plaintiffs causation burden \nwith respect to a municipal liability claim underยง 1983.\"  Cash, 654 F.3d at 342.  Here, \nPlaintiffs have alleged that the City was on notice that detainees were likely to be beaten when \nthey were transferred to ACCF; thus, it was clearly foreseeable that such beatings would occur. \nIf this be proved, the City can be held proximately liable for injuries suffered as a result of these \nbeatings.  Kerman, 374 F.3d at 127. \nFinally, in their reply, the City Defendants raise two additional arguments, neither of \nwhich is persuasive.  (City Defs.' Reply at 5-6.)  The first is that Albany COs were not \n\"subordinates\" such that the City cannot be held responsible for \"acquiescing\" to their action. \nHowever, the City Defendants cite no law that suggesting that Albany COs were not acting as \n\"subordinates\" of the City; furthermore, they appear to ignore the fact the City is paying ACCF \nto house these inmates.  (Am. Compl. ,, 55, 58.)  The second argument is that there can be no \nconstitutional violation for applying under established state law for a transfer to an \"accredited \ninstitution.\"  Here,  too, the City Defendants cite no law supporting this argument, which fails on \nits face-the fact that ACCF is an accredited institution does not mean that its staff cannot \n55 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 56 of 82\ncommit unconstitutional acts of which the City was aware (and allegedly, of which it took \nadvantage). \nAccordingly, the Motion to Dismiss the fourth, fifth, sixth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, \nseventeenth, twenty-first, twenty-second, twenty-third, and twenty-seventh causes of action \nagainst the City is DENIED. \nE.  Plaintiffs Failure to Intervene Claims Against the City and Frank Foe COs \n(Counts 7, 12, 24 & 28) \nPlaintiffs each bring a failure to intervene claim pursuant to ยง 1983 against both the City \n(under Monel[) and the particular DOC ESU COs responsible for transporting Plaintiffs to \nAlbany:  Washington brings his claim against Frank Foes #1-3 and the City (count 7);  Espinal \nagainst Frank Foes #4-6 and the City (count 12); Doe against Frank Foes #7-9 and the City \n(count 24); and, Tillery against Frank Foes #10-12 and the City (count 28). \nPlaintiffs argue that the Frank Foe COs knew the Albany Defendants were going to \nviolate Plaintiffs' constitutional rights and that they had the opportunity to intervene to prevent \nthem from doing so, but they failed to take reasonable steps to intervene.  Plaintiffs argue that the \nCity is liable for failing to intervene because it had a policy or custom of transferring Plaintiffs \nwith the lmowledge that they would be subject to excessive and unlawful force. \nThe City Defendants do not argue that Plaintiffs have not been subjected to constitutional \nviolations; rather, they claim the City Defendants are not proper defendants. \n1.  Individual Claims Against Frank Foe COs \nThe City Defendants raise their opposition to the claims against the Frank Foe COs for \nthe first time in their reply.  (City Defs.' Reply Br. at 10.)  First, they appear to be arguing that \nPlaintiffs should not be allowed to bring these claims, because they did not mention them at the \nconference this Court held on February 8, 2019.  But these claims were pleaded in Plaintiffs' \n56 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 57 of 82\nComplaint and FAC, both of which were filed prior to the February 8, 2019 conference. \nMoreover, the fact that Plaintiffs have not yet identified the Frank Foe Defendants is not \nproblematic-\"It is proper for a section 1983 plaintiffto use a 'Doe' pleading until such time as \nher identity can be learned through discovery or through the aid ofthe trial court.\"  Cole v. Artuz, \nNo. 97 CN. 0977 (RWS), 2000 WL 760749, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. June 12, 2000). \nSecond, the City Defendants argue that these claims should be dismissed because they are \n\"conclusory.\" But they provide no argument explaining why the claims are \"conclusory,\" \nmerely citing Bouche v. City ofM  ount Vernon, No. 11 CN. 5246 SAS, 2012 WL 987592 \n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 23, 2012).  (City Defs.' Reply at 10.)  In Bouche, the comt dismissed a failure to \nintervene claim as \"vague and conclusory\" when Plaintiff allaged that \"defendants\" had an \naffirmative duty to intervene but did not make clear which defendants he was referring to. \nBouche, 2012 WL 987592 at *7.  Here, Plaintiffs have pointed to unnamed but particular officers \nwho \"failed to intervene,\" so Bouche's reasoning is inapplicable.  The Court will not dismiss the \nclaims against the Frank Foe COs based on these grounds. \n2.  Municipal Liability \nPlaintiffs each bring a failure to intervene claim against the City, alleging that the City \nhas a policy or custom of transferring detainees to Albany with the knowledge and expectation \nthat they would be subject to excessive and unlawful force there.  Tbis is the same theory \nunderlying Plaintiffs' excessive force, sexual assault, and unreasonable search claims, which I \nhave already addressed. \nFor the reasons discussed in the context of these claims, Plaintiffs' claims for failure to \nintervene survive the motion to dismiss. \nAccordingly, the Motion to Dismiss the seventh, twelfth, twenty-fomth, and twenty \neighth causes of action is DENIED. \n57 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 58 of 82\nF.  Espinal's Claims for Assault and Battery Against the City and Frank Foes \n#4-6 (Counts 13 & 14) \nIn the thirteenth and fourteenth causes of action, Espinal brings state law claims of \nassault and battery, respectively, against the City and Frank Foes #4-6, the DOC ESU COs \nresponsible for transfetTing Espinal from Rikers to Albany.  Again, the City Defendants do not \nargue that Espinal has not pleaded assault and battery, only that the Frank Foes and the City \ncannot be held liable. \n1.  Individual Liability of Frank Foes #4-6 \nThe City Defendants argue that Espinal's claims against Frank Foes #4-6 are not \nmeritorious or plausible, but provides no reasoning or case law to support their argument. \n\"Under New York law, an assault is 'an intentional placing of another person in fear of \nimminent harmful or offensive contact.'  A battery is 'an intentional wrongful physical contact \nwith another person without consent.\"' Rivera v. Puerto Rican Home Attendants Servs., Inc., \n930 F. Supp. 124, 132-33 (S.D.N.Y. 1996). \nThe FAC alleges that Frank Foes #4-6 had knowledge of the Albany Defendants' \nintention to assault and batter Espinal, and that they provided substantial assistance by tmcuffing \nEspinal and handing him over to be assaulted and battered.  (Am. Compl. ,, 218-19, 556, 561.) \nIt also alleges that Espinal was assaulted and battered when he was threatened and physically \nabused by the Albany Defendants.  (!d. ,, 228-263, 553, 558.)  This is sufficient to state a claim \nthat Frank Foes #4-6 participated in the commission of these intentional torts.  See Herman v. \nWesgate, 94 A.D. 938, 316 (4th Dep't 1983) (liability for tortious acts extends to all who actively \ntake part in the act or lend aid or encouragement to the wrongdoer). \n58 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 59 of 82\n2.  The City's Liability \nThe City mistakenly identifies these claims as Monell claims, but they are not.  Monell \nliability attaches only to ยง 1983 claims.  On these common law claims, Plaintiffs argue that the \nCity can be held liable under a theory of respondeat superior. \nPlaintiffs provide two theories of respondeat superior liability.  First, they allege that the \nCity is liable for the conduct of Frank Foes #4-6, its employees who committed the battery and \nassault.  Second, Plaintiffs allege that the City is liable for the ACCF COs' conduct, because \nthese COs were acting as agents and servants of the City. \n\"According to well-established New York law, an employer is only liable for the actions \nof an employee where the employee was engaged in the furtherance of the employer's business \nand the employer was, or could have been, exercising some control, directly or indirectly, over \nthe employee's activities.\"  Mahmood v.  City ofN  ew York, No. 01 CN. 5899 (SAS), 2003 WL \n21047728, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 8, 2003).  \"Under New York law, the City,just like any other \nprivate entity, is answerable for the conduct of its officers who commit common-law torts, such \nas assault and false imprisonment, when they are acting in the course of their employment.\" \nWilliams v. City ofN  ew York, 121 F. Supp. 3d 354, 376 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (internal quotations \nomitted).  However, the City will not be liable for \"torts committed by the employee solely for \npersonal motives unrelated to the furtherance of the [City's] business.\"  Vega v. Northland Mktg. \nCorp., 289 A.D.2d 565,566 (2d Dep't 2001). \nIt is perfectly clear that the City is potentially liable under a theory of respondeat \nsuperior for the actions of Frank Foes #4-6.  At the time Frank Foes #4-6 engaged in the conduct \nalleged, they were City employ acting in the course of their employment. \nThe more complicated question is whether the City can also be held liable under \nrespondeat superior for the actions of the Albany Defendants. \n59 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 60 of 82\nWhen Espinal was assaulted and battered, he had been turned over to the Albany \nDefendants.  But Plaintiffs argue that the City can still be liable for Espinal's damages resulting \nfrom these intentional torts because, at the time, Espinal was in the legal custody of the DOC. \nPlaintiffs have alleged that in an August 15, 2018letter to Espinal's attorney, the City \nrepresented that it transferred Espinal to ACCF pursuant to 9 NYCRR ยง 721 0.6( e) (rather than 9 \nNYCRR ยง 7210 (a-c)).  Transfers under 9 NYCRR ยง 7210.6(e) occur when there are \n\"extraordinary circumstances\" and involve slightly different procedures for effectuating the \ntransfer.  Significantly, when a transfer is effected pursuant to subsection (e), the inmate remains \nin the legal custody of the facility administrator of the originating facility, even though he is in \nthe physical custody ofthe new facility, until he is permanently transferred. \nDefendants argue that 9 NYCRR ยง 7210.6(e) applies only to \"extraordinary \ncircumstances,\" and that Espinal's transfer did not meet this criterion.  That may well prove true, \nbut, taking the factual allegations of the F AC as true- and since the Court has seen the letter in \nwhich an assistant general cOlmsel for the City informed Espinal's attorney that he was \ntransferred to ACCF pursuant to this part of the statute-I find that Plaintiffs have sufficiently \nalleged that Espinal was in the City's custody when he was subject to the abuses in Albany. \nThe question then becomes whether the Albany COs were acting as agents and servants \nof the City when they perpetrated an assault and battery on Espinal, such that the City can be \nheld responsible for their behavior. \nA principal-agent relationship may be established by evidence of the \"consent of one \nperson to allow another to act on his or her behalf and subject to his or her control, and consent \nby the other so to act.\"  See Fils-Aime v.  Ryder TRS, Inc., 40 AD .3d 917, 918 (2007) (internal \nquotation omitted).  By requesting that Espinal be transferred to ACCF pursuant to 9 NYCRR ยง \n60 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 61 of 82\n7210.6(e), the City knew (or should have known) that Espinal would remain in its legal custody \nbut would be transferred to another facility.  By asking for this specific type of transfer, the City \nplausibly consented to permit staff at the destination facility to act on its behalf, and conferred \nauthority to Albany with respect to Espinal's care, which Albany accepted by taking Espinal into \nits custody.  See Sauter v. New York Tribune, 305 N.Y. 442,444-45 (1953) (describing \ndelegation of authority in master-servant relationship).  Moreover, the ACCF COs were \nundoubtedly acting in the course of their employment when they assaulted Espinal, and the City \ncould have reasonably anticipated that the COs would commit an assault in these circumstances. \nSee Ramos v. Jake Realty Co., 21 A.D.3d 744,745 (1st Dep't 2005).  It is, therefore, presumable \nthat, in these unique circumstances, the City could be held liable for the Albany Defendants' \nactions under a theory of respondeat superior.  It would certainly not be appropriate to dismiss \nthis claim until the facts have been fleshed out in discovery. \nAccordingly, the Motion to Dismiss the thirteenth and fourteenth causes of action is \nDENIED. \nG.  Plaintiffs' Claims of Deliberate Indifference to Detainee Safety Against the \nCity, Brann, and Williams (Count 33) \nIn the thirty-third cause of action, all Plaintiffs claim, pursuant to ยง 1983, that the City, \nBrann, and Williams exhibited deliberate indifference to their safety in violation of their \nFourteenth Amendment rights by transfenยทing them to Albany.  With respect to Brann and \nWilliams, Plaintiffs allege that when transferring them to Albany, Brann and Williams acted \nintentionally to risk Plaintiffs' safety or recklessly failed to act with reasonable care to mitigate \nthe risk to Plaintiffs' safety.  With respect to the City, Plaintiffs allege that there was an official \npolicy or custom of transferring selected detainees to ACCF with the knowledge and expectation \nthat they would be subject to an unreasonable risk to their safety there. \n61 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 62 of 82\nThe City Defendants rely on the same arguments that they claim prohibit liability against \nthem for the abuses that occurred in Albany-that they did not transfer Plaintiffs, that Plaintiffs \nhave not alleged individual or municipal knowledge of the abuses, and that there was no \ncausation.  Those arguments are no more persuasive in this context than they were in the context \nin which they were initially raised. \nยท l.  Individual Liability \n\"Allowing an attack on an inmate to proceed without intervening is a constitutional \nviolation in certain circumstances.\" Rosen v. City ofN  ew York, 667 F. Supp. 2d 355, 359 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2009) (internal citation omitted).  Allegations that defendants have failed to provide \ndetainees with reasonable safety are evaluated under a deliberate indifference standard.  See Milo \nv.  City ofN  ew York, 59 F. Supp. 3d 513, 524 (E.D.N.Y. 2014).  This is a two-prong test:  \"First, \nthe P1aintiffmust show that the challenged conditions of confinement were 'sufficiently serious \nto constitute objective deprivations of the right to due process;\"' second, the plaintiff must show \nthat the defendant '\"acted with at least deliberate indifference to the challenged conditions.\"' \nHarris v. City ofN  ew York, No. 15-CV-6341 (NG) (JO), 2018 WL 1997974, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. \nApr. 27, 2018) (quoting Darnell, 849 F.3d at 29).  \"To establish a claim for deliberate \nindifference ... , the pretrial detainee must prove that the defendant-official acted intentionally \nto impose the alleged condition, or recklessly failed to act with reasonable care to mitigate the \nrisk that the condition posed to the pretrial detainee even though the defendant-official knew, or \nshould have known, that the condition posed an excessive risk to health or safety.\"  Darnell, 849 \nF.3d at 35. \nWilliams \n1. \nAll Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged a deliberate indifference claim against Williams. \nAs I have already discussed, as part of the F AC, Plaintiffs relied on an affidavit in which \n62 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 63 of 82\nWilliams explained that ACCF was continually willing to accept City inmates with \"violent \ninfractions histories\" when no other jail would, and that he often sent such inmates to Albany. \n(Am. Compl. ~ 112.)  Given the validity of the alleged facts, viewed in a light most favorable to \nPlaintiffs, the Court cannot conclude on a motion to dismiss that Williams was unaware that \nAlbany was using force and other unconstitutional tactics to manage these detainees that other \nfacilities did not want to accept.  This is all the more true because of the allegations that the \n\"Frank Foe\" defendants-who were New York City COs-witnessed, and so understood, at least \nsome of what occurred at ACCF upon arrival.  Thus, Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that \nWilliams should have known that Plaintiffs were being subjected to umeasonable risk to their \nsafety by being transferred to Albany.  Cf StetFart, 2018 WL 1633819, at *7 (granting motion to \ndismiss when complaint did not allege any individual defendant \"was are or should have been \naware\" ofthe possibility of \"excessive risk\" to safety). \nii.  Brann \nPlaintiffs also claim that Brann acted intentionally to endanger Plaintiffs' safety, or, in \nthe alternative, that she failed to mitigate risk that she should have known about.  Taking all \nallegations in favor of Plaintiffs, the Court cannot conclude on a motion to dismiss that Brann \nwas unaware of what was going on in Albany, given the alleged knowledge of the Frank Foe \nCOs as well as Williams, who worked with Brann to request the SJOs. \n2.  Municipal Liability \nFor the reasons already discussed in the context of Plaintiffs' Monell claims against the \nCity for abuses Plaintiffs experienced at ACCF, Plaintiffs' deliberate indifference claims against \nthe City will not be dismissed - Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that the City was on notice of \nwhat was occurring in Albany prior to the transfers, and nevertheless, subjected Plaintiffs to \nconditions that posed a risk to their safety.  (See infra II.D, II.E.2) \n63 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 64 of 82\nAll ofthese issues will undoubtedly be raised again in post-discovery motions.  For now, \nhowever, the Motion To Dismiss the thirty-third cause of action is DENIED. \nH.  Washington's First Amendment Claim against the City, Brann, Williams, \nand Walker (Count 3) \nIn the third cause of action, Plaintiff Washington alleges a First Amendment retaliation \nclaim pursuant to ยง 1983 against the City, Brann, Williams, and Walker.  He alleges that he was \ntransferred as punishment for the fact that he lodged repeated complaints with the Legal Aid \nSociety Prisoners' Rights Project.  (Am. Compl. ,, 130-31,501, 503.) \n\"To sustain a First Amendment retaliation claim, a prisoner must demonstrate the \nfollowing: '(1) that the speech or conduct at issue was protected, (2) that the defendant took \nadverse action against the plaintiff, and (3) that there was a causal connection between the \nprotected speech and the adverse action.\"' Gill v. Pidlypchak, 389 F.3d 379, 380 (2d Cir. 2004) \n(quoting Dawes v.  Walker, 239 F.3d 489,492 (2d Cir.2001), overruled on other grounds, \nSwierkiewicz v. Sorema NA., 534 U.S. 506 (2002). \nThe first and third factors are at issue here.  The City Defendants argue that Washington \nhas failed to plausibly identify an exercise of free speech and that he has not demonstrated an \nadequate causal connection between the speech and the transfer.  The City Defendants do not \nargue that they did not take adverse action against the Plaintiff, or that these particular \nDefendants cannot be held liable. \nTurning to the first factor, Washington has successfully pleaded an exercise of protected \nspeech.  In the prison context, the filing of a grievance is a protected activity.  Gill, 398 F.3d at \n384; see also Davis v.  Goard, 320 F.3d 346, 352-53 (2d Cir. 2003).  So is the filing of a lawsuit. \nSee Espinal v.  Goard, 558 F.3d 119, 129 (2d Cir. 2009).  Furthermore, case law suggests that a \nprisoner's oral complaint may serve as the basis of a First Amendment claim.  See Tirado v. \n64 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 65 of 82\nShutt, No. 13 CIV. 2848 LTS AJP, 2015 WL 774982, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 23, 2015), report and \nrecommendation adopted in part, No. 13CV2848-L TS-AJP, 2015 WL 44 7 6027 (S .D .N.Y. July \n22, 2015) (citing cases); see also, e.g., Varela v.  Demmon, 491 F. Supp. 2d 442, 451-52 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2007). \nPlaintiffs argue that Washington's complaints to the Legal Aid Society, which were \npassed on to DOC, were the \"functional equivalent\" of filing a grievance and an oral complaint, \nthe only difference being that a third-party conveyed the complaint to DOC.  (Pis.' Br. at 23.) \nThe Court agrees.  Washington lodged a complaint with Legal Aid, and Legal Aid contacted \nDOC on his behalf.  This is akin to Plaintiffs filing an oral complaint himself.  See Meriwether \nv.  Coughlin, 879 F.2d 103 7, 1046 (2d Cir. 1989) (finding prisoners participated in speech when, \namong other activity, they corresponded with public interest organizations). \nLegal Aid's complaint to DOC on behalf of Washington also shares key characteristics \nwith a lawsuit, which is also a form of protected speech.  In both instances, the complaint is \nmade in a plaintiffs name, but is articulated by a third-party advocate in a better position to \ncommunicate the inmate's needs. \nTurning to the third factor, to allege a causal connection, the plaintiff must demonstrate \nthat the protected conduct was \"a substantial or motivating factor for the adverse actions taken \nby prison officials.\"  Dorsey v. Fisher, 468 F. App'x 25, 27 (2d Cir. 2012) (summary order). \nTemporal proximity can be sufficient to establish causation if a plaintiff demonstrates that the \nprotected activity was \"close in time\" to the adverse action.  Espinal, 558 F.3d at 129.  There is \nno \"bright line\" for temporal proximity and a court exercises judgment based on the case at \nissue.  Id.  However, in the Second Circuit, \"two to three months\" is generally the limit.  See \n65 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 66 of 82\nAdams v. Ellis, No. 09 CIV. 1329 PKC, 2012 WL 693568, at *16 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 2, 2012) \n(citing cases), aff'd, 536 F. App'x 144 (2d Cir. 2013). \nHere, Plaintiff alleges that Legal Aid communicated his complaints to DOC on or about \nMarch 16 and March 26,2018, and that he was transfened on March 28,2018.  The temporal \nproximity between the lodging of Washington's complaints and his transfer is sufficient to allege \na causal connection between the speech and the adverse action. \nFor the reasons, the City Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the third cause of action is \nDENIED. \nI.  Plaintiffs' Right to Counsel Claims Against the City, Braun, and Williams \n(Count32) \nIn the thirty-second cause of action, Plaintiffs bring ยง 1983 claims against the City, \nBrann, and Williams, alleging that their transfer to ACCF violated their Sixth Amendment right \nto counsel. \nThe City Defendants make four arguments as to why these claims should be dismissed: \n(1) the City Defendants cannot be held responsible for the transfers (an argument that I have \nrepeatedly rejected); (2) the SCOC made findings that \"safety concerns\" justified the transfer, \nwhich makes them a reasonable restriction on the Sixth Amendment right (also rejected, since \nwe cannot at present know what the SCOC did and did not do other than stamp the requests \napproved); (3) distance itself is insufficient for a Sixth Amendment claim; and, (4 ) Plaintiffs \nhave not plausibly alleged that they were harmed or prejudiced by the distance.  (City Defs.' Br. \nat 15-17.) \nPretrial detainees have a \"constitutionally protected right to the effective assistance of \ncounsel,\" which attaches at the initiation of criminal proceedings.  Cobb v. Aytch, 643 F.2d 946, \n957 (3d Cir. 1981) (citing Kirby v.  Illinois, 406 U.S. 682, 689 (1972)).  Jail regulations that \n66 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 67 of 82\n\"unjustifiably obstruct the availability of professional representation or other aspects of the right \nof access to the courts are invalid,\" but all regulations must be evaluated \"in light of the central \nobjective of prison administration, safeguarding of institutional security.\" Benjamin v. Fraser, \n264 F.3d. 175, 184, 187 (2d Cir. 2001) (internal quotations omitted). \nCourts have found the transfer of pretrial detainees between facilities that significantly \ninterferes with access to counsel to violate the Sixth Amendment.  See, e.g., Cobb, 643 F .2d at \n957.  In Cobb v. Aytch, the Third Circuit found that the transfer of pretrial detainees from \nPhiladelphia to facilities ranging from 90-300 miles away from the city violated the Sixth \nAmendment.  Id. at 949, 957.  In making its decision, the Cobb court relied on \"extensive \nfindings\" made by the district court with respect to the detainees' access to legal representation. \nId. at 957.  These findings included that interviews-both pre-trial and pre-sentencing-were \n\"essential\" to the detainees' defenses and that local public defenders lacked \"resources of money \nand time\" to effectively conduct these interviews at locations distant from the city.  I d. at 951. \nThe Second Circuit has twice recognized the validity of the Third Circuit's finding in Cobb, and \nhas remanded a case to the district court to determine whether a transfer to a facility 56 miles \naway violated a detainees' Sixth Amendment Rights.  See Covino v.  Vermont Dep 't ofC  arr., 933 \nF.2d 128, 130 (2d Cir. 1991); see also Benjamin, 264 F. 3d at 187. \nIn support of their Sixth Amendment claim against the City Defendants, Plaintiffs allege \nthat ACCF's location- 160 miles from New York City-makes it extremely difficult for \nPlaintiffs' criminal defense attorneys to visit their clients.  (Am. Compl., 114.)  The affidavit of \nRuben Fernandez, Plaintiff Espinal's attorney/ explains why the distance and the circumstances \nof the Albany facility make it \"effectively impossible\" for appointed criminal defense attorneys \n7 The Court may consider the Ruben Affidavit as it was incorporated into the Complaint and the FAC. \nTe/labs, Inc., 551 U.S. at 322 (2007). \n67 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 68 of 82\nto effectively counsel their clients.  (Id. ~ 115; Aff. of Ruben Daria Fernandez (\"Fernandez \nAff.\"), Dkt. No. 37.) \nAs the City Defendants have pointed out, distance - even with the added hardships faced \nby a public defender- is not necessarily dispositive; adequately administered alternatives that \nallow an inmate to communicate with counsel despite him or her being located far from the court \nmight ameliorate any interference with the detainee's Sixth Amendment right (even if they are \nnot ideal).  See United States v. Lucas, 873 F.2d 1279, 1280 (9th Cir. 1989).  Plaintiffs have \npresented allegations that the \"practical alternatives\" available at ACCF are not sufficiently \nimplemented to allow inmates the required assistance of counsel.  (Fernandez Aff. ,11 0; see also \nAm. Compl. ~~ 115-23.)  Fernandez's affidavit details that the alternatives provided by ACCF \nincluding videoconferencing and inmates' production in the Bronx- are inadequate because of \npoor quality of the videoconferences, a potential lack of privacy, lack of face-to-face contact to \nestablish trust, and the fact that inmates are not produced for conferences and comi dates when \nthey are supposed to be.  (Fernandez Aff. ~~ 10, 13.)  Plaintiffs have also alleged that there is no \naccess to umecorded legal telephone calls.  (Am. Compl. ~~ 118-23.) \nConsidering these allegations in a light most favorable to Plaintiffs, I find that they are \nsufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.  The alleged distance from New York City to ACCF is \ngreater than cases in which courts have found Sixth Amendment violations plausible.  See \nCovino, 933 F.2d at 130; Cobb, 643 F.2d at 951.  Fernandez's affidavit describes why the travel \nat issue in this case is not an insignificant burden on Plaintiffs' criminal defense attorneys, who \nare typically public defenders with large case loads and a myriad of responsibilities, and also why \nthe alternative forms of communication offered by ACCF are inadequate to ameliorate this \nburden.  (Fernandez Aff. ~ 11.) \n68 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 69 of 82\nPlaintiffs have also sufficiently alleged that they were harmed or prejudice.  The F AC \nalleges that Plaintiffs were all housed significant distances from their attorneys, and in solitary \nconfinement, where they were deprived of confidential legal phone calls.  Cf McFadden v. \nSolfaro, No. 95 CIV. 1148 (LBS), 1998 WL 199923, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 23, 1998) (denying \nSixth Amendment claim based on far away transfer when Plaintiff offered no specific facts as to \nhow and when he was denied access to counsel). \nOf course, to win their case, Plaintiffs will have to establish that \"safety issues\" did not \njustify their transfers, despite the fact that the transfer may have burdened their right to counsel. \nThey will also have to provide in more detail the injuries suffered by each Plaintiff as a result of \ntheir inadequate access to counsel.  But at this stage, Plaintiffs have alleged facts sufficient to \nsupport their claim. \nThe Motion to Dismiss the thirty-second cause of action is DENIED. \nIII.  The City Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to 12(b)(l) \nThe City Defendants also moved to dismiss Plaintiffs' claim for permanent injunctive \nrelief for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. 8 \nThe City Defendants argue Plaintiffs lack standing to sue for injunctive relief as a class or \notherwise.  They contend that Plaintiff Espinal-the only Plaintiff who was still being housed at \nACCF at the time the City Defendants filed their motion- failed to exhaust his administrative \nremedies, which would preclude him from bringing a claim for injunctive relief.  But the City \nDefendants waived the PLRA exhaustion affirmative defense (see Dkt. No. 81), so if Espinal \n8 The Court notes that there is not one claim that is specifically tied to the request for permanent injunctive \nrelief.  One would assume that the City is referring to counts one, two, thirty-two, and thirty-three, the claims \nbrought by all Plaintiffs against the City, Brann, and Williams, which can be remedied with injunctive relief. \n69 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 70 of 82\nwere still in ACCF custody, the Motion to Dismiss for lack of standing would have been denied \non this basis. \nSince the filing of the briefs related to the Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiff Espinal was \nsentenced and (quite expediently) transferred to state custody.  He is no longer being housed at \nACCF.  As a result, there is no basis to impose an injunction against Defendants with regard to \nhis housing at ACCF. \nThis does not, however, mean that this action cannot be maintained-Espinal still has \nclaims for damages- or that it cannot proceed as a class action.  The fact that there was standing \nand a controversy when the case was filed is \"sufficient ... to enable the suit to proceed as a \nclass action.\"  White v.

In addition, the Court \nconsiders additional material submitted by the parties in suppmi of the severance motion.  See \nDickerson v. Novartis Corp., 315 F.R.D. 18,23 n.l (S.D.N.Y. 2016). \nI.  Legal Standard \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 21 provides that the court may \"sever any claim against a \nparty.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 21.  A trial court has \"broad discretion\" as to whether to grant a motion to \nsever.  Gram v.  Sou/Cycle LLC, 979 F. Supp. 2d 498, 502 (S.D.N.Y. 2013).  A court \nappropriately exercises this discretion when severance \"furthers the aims of justice, promotes \njudicial economy and efficiency, and avoids prejudicing the rights of any party.\"  In re Merrill \nLynch & Co., Inc. Research Reports Sec. Litig., 214 F.RD. 152, 155 (S.D.N.Y. 2003). \nNevertheless, severance is \"a procedural device to be employed only in exceptional \ncircumstances.\"  Wausau Bus. Ins.  Co. v.  Turner Canst. Co., No. 86017, 2001 WL 963943, at *1 \n(S.D.N.Y. Aug. 23, 2001) (internal quotation omitted).  The moving party \"bears the burden of \ndemonstrating that 'severance is required to avoid prejudice or confusion and to promote the \nends of justice.\"' N  Jersey Media Grp. Inc. v. Fox News Network, LLC, 312 F.R.D. 111, 114 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2015) (quotingAgnesini v. Doctor's Assoc., Inc., 275 F.R.D. 456,458 (S.D.N.Y. \n2011)). \n71 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 72 of 82\nSecond Circuit courts consider the following factors when determining whether to sever a \nclaim:  \"(I) whether the claims arise out of the same transaction or occurrence; (2) whether the \nclaims present some common questions oflaw or fact; (3) whether settlement of the claims or \njudicial economy would be facilitated; (4 ) whether prejudice would be avoided if severance were \ngranted; and ( 5) whether different witnesses and documentary proof are required for the separate \nclaims.\"  N. Jersey Media Grp. Inc., 312 F.R.D. at 114 (citing Oram, 979 F. Supp. 2d at 502-03). \nSome courts have granted severance when only one of these factors is present but generally, \nseverance is granted when more than one condition is met.  !d. (collecting cases); see also Oram, \n979 F. Supp. 2d at 503. \nIf a court decides to sever some of the claims, it then considers whether the claims should \nbe transferred - \"Where certain claims are properly severed, the result is that there are then two \nor more separate 'actions,' and the district comt may, pursuant toยง 1404(a), transfer certain of \nsuch separate actions while retaining jurisdiction of others.\"  Wyndham Assocs. v. Bintli.ff, 398 \nF.2d 614, 618 (2d Cir. 1968). \nII.  Discussion \nThe Albany Defendants submit that Plaintiffs have attempted to \"bootstrap\" their claims \nagainst the Albany Defendants to those against the City Defendants in order to establish venue in \nthe Southem District of New York.  They contend that the claims against them are separate and \ndistinct causes of action, and that the two sets of claims should be tried in separate fora.  They \nalso argue that severance would further justice and judicial economy, as well as avoid prejudice, \nbut they provide almost no reasoning as to why this is the case.  (Mem. of Law in Supp. ofDefs.' \nMot. for Severance and Transfer to the Northem District ofNew York (\"Albany Defs.' Sev. \nBr.\"),  Dkt. No. 59, at 5-6.) \n72 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 73 of 82\nPlaintiffs argue that their structural reform case regarding the City's decision to send \ndetainees to Albany is entwined with what actually occurred in Albany, and that their choice of \nforum should not be disturbed.  They also argue that the parties, witnesses, and proof overlap \nsubstantially, and that piecemeal litigation would prejudice plaintiffs.  (Pis.' Consolidated Mem. \nof Law in Opp. to the Albany County Defs. And Def. Mylroie's Mots. To Sever and Transfer the \nCase (\"Pis.' Sev. Br.\"), Dkt. No. 69, at 6-12.) \nThe Court considers these arguments in the context of the five factors used by the Second \nCircuit to determine if severance is warranted. \nA.  Arise Out of the Same Transaction or Occurrence \n\"While' [t]here is no rigid rule as to what constitutes the same series of transactions or \noccurrences,' courts 'repeatedly have interpreted the phrase \"same transaction\" to encompass \n\"all logically related claims.\"'\" N. Jersey Media Grp. Inc., 312 F.R.D. at 115 (quoting Agnesini, \n275 F.R.D. at 458-59); see also Todaro v. Siegel Fenchel & Peddy, P.C., No. 04-CV-\n2939JSWDW, 2008 WL 682596, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 3, 2008) (\"Applying this standard to \nmotions to sever trials, district courts in this Circuit generally 'permit all logically related claims \nby or against different parties to be tried in a single proceeding.'\" (quoting Blesedell v. Mobil Oil \nCo., 708 F.Supp. 1408, 1421 (S.D.N.Y. 1989)).  Courts take a \"case-by-case\" approach to \ndetermine whether the circumstances constitute one transaction or occunยทence.  See Costello v. \nHome Depot USA., Inc., 888 F. Supp. 2d 258, 263 (D. Conn. 2012). \nThe Court finds that all of Plaintiffs' claims are logically related because they are all part \nof the single \"transaction\" of transferring Plaintiffs to ACCF with the intention- and result-that \nPlaintiffs would be subjected to punitive treatment upon their arrival.  Plaintiffs have alleged that \nactions taken by the Albany Defendants are one part of the City Defendants' larger plan to \npunish Plaintiffs and others.  Plaintiffs' claims depend both on what the City Defendants \n73 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 74 of 82\nbelieved would occur in Albany, what actually occmTed, and any coordination between the City \nand Albany Defendants.  It is clear that there is a significant relationship between the two sets of \nclaims. \nNotably, this case is unlike prisoner cases in which courts have found severance desirable \nbecause claims arose out of unrelated transactions or occurrences.  For example, in James v. \nOsbourne, No. 11 CV 4182 NGG, 2012 WL 4849131, (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 18, 2012), report and \nrecommendation adopted, No. 11-CV-4182 NGG CLP, 2012 WL 4849160 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 11, \n2012), a prisoner brought claims against COs at multiple correctional facilities.  Id. at *5.  The \ncourt severed the claims because the \"incidents alleged to have occurred at these three facilities \nappear[ed] discrete,\" aside from a general allegation of conspiracy, which had no factual basis. \nId.  In Melendez v.  Wilson, No. 04 CIV. 0073(PKC), 2006 WL 2621083, (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 12, \n2006), plaintiff brought claims against 46 defendants and six \"John Does,\" which arose out of 17 \nindividual incidents occurring over two years at two facilities.  Id. at *1.  The Comt severed the \nclaims arising out of incidents that occurred at a facility outside of its jurisdiction, and \ntransferred them to the Northern District, where venue was proper.  I d.  at * 10.  And, in Salgado \nv. NYS Dep 't ofCorr. & Cmty. Supervision, No. 13-CV -01108-RJA-MJR, 2018 WL 1663255, \n(W.D.N.Y. Apr. 6, 2018), the court severed allegations of excessive force, retaliation, religious \ndiscrimination, and deliberate indifference that occurred at one correctional facility from those \nthat occurred at two other facilities, both of which were located in a different district, because \n\"they involve different defendants, locations and time periods as well as separate allegations of \n* \nwrongdoing.\" I d. at  3. \nUnlike these cases, Plaintiffs' claims are not \"discrete\" and do not allege \"separate \nallegations of wrongdoing.\"  This case alleges a general scheme of transferring young prisoners \n74 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 75 of 82\nout of New York County, where they cannot be kept in solitary confinement, to Albany, where \nthey can be-the City's intent being to punish them and ensure they can be placed solitary \nconfinement.  The Albany Defendants are alleged to have acted as the City Defendants' agents \nfor the purpose of punishing the young detainees.  Thus, the claims against the City Defendants \nand the Albany Defendants should be kept together.  While not all causes of action are brought \nagainst all Defendants, this does not mean that the claims may not be part of the same \n\"transaction\" or that they are \"indirectly\" related.  Cf Wyndham, 398 F.2d at 618 (severance is \nappropriate when \"defendants as to whom venue would not be proper in the transferee district \nare alleged to be only indirectly connected to the manipulations which form the main subject \nmatter of the action\"). \nB.  Common Qnestions of Law or Fact \nIt is clear that there are common issues of fact between the two sets of claims.  The \ndetails of what happened upon Plaintiffs' arrival at ACCF will be instrumental for both the \nclaims against the City Defendants and the claims against ACCF Defendants. \nInformation about the assaults on Plaintiffs is relevant to the Plaintiffs' substantive due \nprocess claims against the City (count 2), the deliberate indifference claims against Defendant \nthe City, Williams, and Brann (count 32), the failure to intervene claims against the City, Brann, \nand Frank Foe COs (counts 7, 12, 24, & 28), and Plaintiff Espinal's assault and battery claims \n(counts 13 & 14).  And information as to why and how ACCF administrators determined to place \nPlaintiffs in punitive segregation- i.e., whether it was pretextual- is probative of Plaintiffs' \nsubstantive due process claims against the City Defendants and its procedural due process claims \nagainst the Albany Defendants (counts 1, 8, 20, 26 & 30). \nPlaintiffs' claims against both the City Defendants and the Albany Defendants for denial \nof adequate access to legal counsel (counts 31 & 32) are another area of factual overlap.  The \n75 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 76 of 82\nadequacy of the legal services that Plaintiffs had access to at ACCF is relevant to potentially \nmitigate the hardships caused by the distance between the Bronx and Albany, and of course, is \nthe underlying issue in the claim against the Albany Defendants. \nC.  Judicial Economy and Overlap of Evidence \nThis factor turns on whether the Court believes that one trial is more efficient than two. \n\"[O]ne trial is usually more efficient than two.\" N  Jersey Media Grp. Inc., 312 F .R.D. at 117. \nThe ultimate question is whether \"separate trials will result in substantial overlap of witnesses or \ndocumentary proof.\"  Costello, 888 F. Supp. 2d at 264 (emphasis in original) (internal citation \nomitted). \nGiven that there are overlapping issues of fact, it is not surprising that there is also \ncommonality of witness and evidence, despite the fact that the Albany Defendants' claim that \n\"none ofthe New York City defendants would even take part in the litigation as it pertains to the \nAlbany Defendants.\"  (Albany Defs.' Sev. Br. at 6.) \nPlaintiffs have identified witnesses - such as Plaintiffs' criminal defense attorneys and \nthe Albany County Defendants - whose testimony would be relevant to claims against both sets \nof Defendants, particularly those related to access to counsel.  Plaintiffs contend that they will \nrequire evidence from Albany Defendants to determine the details of coordination between \nACCF and Williams (and any other City Defendants involved in the transfer process) to support \ntheir substantive due process claims against the City Defendants (count 2), as well as for the \n\"failure to intervene\" claims against the Frank Foe COs and the City Defendants (counts 7, 12, \n24 & 28).  Evidence from Frank Foe COs responsible for transporting Plaintiffs from DOC \ncustody to ACCF are also like to be necessary for Plaintiffs to support their abuse claims against \nthe Albany Defendants.  (Pis.' Sev. Br. at 8-9.) \n76 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 77 of 82\nDefendants provide very limited evidence as to why severance would benefit judicial \neconomy.  Defendant Mylroie contends that her claims require different evidence and witnesses \nthan the claims against the City Defendants, and that all ofthis evidence is located either at \nACCF or the surr-ounding facilities.  (Mem. of Law in Supp. ofDef. Mylroie's Mot. to Sever and \nTransfer (\"Mylroie Br.\"), Dkt. No. 61-2, at 6-7.)  Yet, medical records and any related testimony \nare likely to be relevant evidence in claims against ACCF and the City to demonstrate Plaintiffs' \ninjuries. \nSince there is at least some overlap of witnesses and evidence, which favors judicial \neconomy, these factors favor Plaintiffs.  See Kirkv. Metro. Transp. Auth., No. 99 CN. 3787 \n(RWS), 2001 WL 25703, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 10, 2001) (\"The possibility of duplicate \npresentation of evidence at each trial weighs against severance.\"); German by German v.  Fed. \nHome Loan Mortg. Corp., 896 F. Supp. 1385, 1401 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) (denying motion for \nseverance when proof of many points would \"in significant part require the testimony of the \nsame witnesses and presentation of the same evidence as [would] be required in proving them \nagainst the other defendants\"). \nD.  Avoidance of Prejudice \nCourts consider how severance might avoid or generate prejudice to the Parties. \n\"Severance is appropriate where a joint trial 'could lead to confusion of the jmy. \"' Costello, 888 \nF. Supp. 2d at 265 (quoting Deskovic v.  City ofP  eekskill, 673 F. Supp.2d 154, 171 (S.D.N.Y. \n2009).  The Court balances the effect of severance on both Plaintiffs and Defendants.  See, e.g., \nS.E.C. v. Parnes, No. 01 CIV 0763 LLS THK, 2001 WL 1658275, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 26, \n2001). \nPlaintiffs argue that \"piecemeal\" litigation would be both impractical and prejudicial. \nSpecifically, they assert that the Court should not transfer the excessive force and other abuse-\n77 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 78 of 82\nrelated damages claims against the Albany Defendants to the Northern District of New York and \napply collateral estoppel to the underlying facts, determining the City Defendants' liability for \nPlaintiffs' injuries at trial in the Southern District only if Plaintiffs prevail in Albany.9  Plaintiffs \nargue that they cannot, and should not, have to pause their pursuit of injunctive relief while \nwaiting for the Northern District to litigate, because they would then have to conduct discovery \ninto the events at ACCF in two different cases simultaneously, which would be \"costly and \ncumbersome.\"  (Pis.' Sev. Br. at 10.) \nThe Albany Defendants have failed to address prejudice in the context of severance, aside \nfrom suggesting that it would be inconvenient for Defendants to travel to the Southern District of \nNew York.  But as Plaintiffs have pointed out, efficient discovery practices can limit this \ninconvenience, with the exception of travel for trial.  (Pls.' Sev. Br. at 11 (suggesting depositions \ncould be taken in Albany during designating period of time).) \nDefendant Mylroie has argued that the case will prejudice her not only because of the \ndistance but also because jurors will be confused between the claims of deliberate indifference \nand the constitutionality of Plaintiffs' transfer.  She argues that her role will be \"lost in the \nweeds\" and the factual issues \"significantly clouded.\"  (Mylroie Br. at 8.) \nThis is not a circumstance where the claims against Mylroie are so umelated to the claims \nagainst the other Defendants to demonstrate that the jury would be significantly confused.  Any \npotential prejudice could be ameliorated by specific instructions to the jury.  See Tee Vee Toons, \nInc. v. Rep Sales, Inc., No. 03 CIV. 10148 (JGK), 2009 WL 1422610, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. May 20, \n2009) (\"Careful instructions and limiting instructions can easily make clear the specific issues \nthat the jury is called upon to decide.\"); see also Lutz v. Buono, No. 05 CIV. 4879 (GAY), 2009 \n9 This possibility was initially raised by tbe Court at the February 8, 2019 conference. \n78 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 79 of 82\nWL 3364032, at* 1 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 16, 2009) (\"Juries in this District routinely decide cases \ninvolving multiple plaintiffs and multiple claims, and any risk that the jury may become \nconfused can be addressed by clear jury instructions.\" (internal quotation removed)).  Ultimately, \nthe Albany Defendants have not established that they will experience prejudice if the claims are \nkept together. \nE.  Severance Is Not Warranted At This Time \nBased on these factors, the Court concludes that severance is not warranted at the stage of \nthis litigation.  The F AC alleges a scheme that, while driven by the City Defendants, was \nimplemented by both the City and the Albany Defendants.  As a result, there are significant \noverlapping issues of fact (and therefore, witnesses and evidence) between the claims that \nwarrant keeping them together in one fmum in order to promote judicial efficiency and avoid \nsignificant prejudice. \nDiscovery in this case will likely provide insight as to whether the evidence and \nwitnesses necessary to support Plaintiffs' claims against the City Defendants and the Albany \nDefendants are in fact as intertwined as Plaintiffs have alleged.  Accordingly, while the Court \ndenies the motion to sever, it does so without prejudice to renewal if, after additional discovery, \n\"such relief appears appropriate.\"  United States v. Yonkers Bd. ofE d., 518 F. Supp. 191, 197 \n(S.D.N.Y. 1981);  see also Lyons v. Litton Loan Servicing LP, No. 1:13-CV-513 ALC GWG, \n2014 WL 5039458, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 29, 2014) (concluding that \"Rule 21 analysis suggests \nthat severance is not warranted at this stage of the litigation\" but finding it may be later in the \naction prior to trial). \n79 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 80 of 82\nPLAINTIFF STEVEN ESPINAL'S MOTION FOR A PRELIMINARY \nINJUNCTION \nEspinal filed a motion for preliminary injunctive relief on January 28,2019, asking that \nthe Court order that he be held in a DOC facility in New York City during the pendency of his \ncase and until he was released from DOC Custody. \nOn March 27,2019, Espinal was sentenced in his criminal case, after accepting an offer \nfrom the trial judge to plead guilty to the underlying criminal charges against him.  (Dkt. No. \n89.)  On April4, 2019, Espinal was (very quickly) transfenยทed into state custody.  As he is no \nlonger being held at ACCF and is no longer in DOC custody, his preliminary injunction \napplication is moot and is denied.  (Dkt. No. 91.) \nThe Court recognizes, as Plaintiffs have pointed out, that while the transfer may moot \nEspinal's individual application for a preliminary injunction, it does not impact the pending \nmotion for class certification, which may be deemed to relate back to the filing ofthe complaint. \nSee Samele v. Zucker, 324 F Supp 3d 313,330 (E.D.N.Y. 2018). \nADDITIONAL ORDERS \nIn addition to denying the various motions that are disposed of in this opinion, the Court \nissues the following separate orders. \nI.  Valentin Order \nTo the extent that this has not already occurred, the Defendant City of New York has \nfifteen days from the date of this opinion to provide counsel for Plaintiffs with the names and \naddresses of any and all COs who were involved in the transfer of the four named Plaintiffs to \nACCF, including the \"Frank Foe\" defendants who accompanied Plaintiffs when they were taken \nto Albany.  This Valentin order also extends to all COs who were involved in the altercation with \nEspinal at Rikers Island and the altercation with Tillery at the Brooklyn Detention Center. \n80 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 81 of 82\nDefendant Albany County also has fifteen days to provide the names and addresses of \nany and all COs who are alleged to have been involved in the assaults on Plaintiffs, including \nany \"Frank Foe\" defendants.  See Valentin v. Dinkins, 121 F.3d 72 (2d Cir. 1997) (per curiam). \nII.  Reference to Law Enforcement \nThis lawsuit will play out in the ordinary course, with discovery, further motion practice \n(which I view as inevitable), and, quite possibly, a trial.  However, the Court is deeply troubled \nby the allegations of the FAC.  Many of the actions pleaded therein would, if proved, constitute \ncrimes under federal or state law, or both-whether as deprivations of civil rights or assaults. \nBarbarity of the sort alleged in the F AC cannot be tolerated in a civilized society; and when such \nconduct is plausibly alleged, it should be investigated by those responsible for enforcing the \ncriminal law, not just litigated in a civil court. \nI recognize that we are at the pre-answer motion stage in this lawsuit.  But from the \nallegations of the FAC, there is reason to conclude, even at this early stage, that at least some of \nthe horrors that are described in that pleading actually took place.  Plaintiffs plausibly plead that \na Justice of the New York State Supreme Court directed that Espinal be given medical attention \nwhen he was brought into the Bronx from Albauy for a court date, and that another Justice of \nthat same court mandated that he be released from punitive segregation.  It does not seem to me \nappropriate that such allegations should remain solely in the purview of civil litigation. \nAccordingly, this Court hereby refers the allegations underlying the transfer and \nsubsequent alleged mistreatment of the four named Plaintiffs to the following law enforcement \nagencies: the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York; the United States \nAttorney for the Northern District of New York, the Albany County District Attorney, the New \nYork County District Attorney, and the Queens County District Attorney. \n81 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-12306-CM   Document 94   Filed 04/30/19   Page 82 of 82\nCONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the City Defendants' Motion to Dismiss is DENIED. \nThe Albany Defendants' Motion to Sever and Transfer and Defendant Mylroie's Motion \nto Sever are DENIED without prejudice. \nPlaintiff Steven Espinal's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction is DENIED. \nThe Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to te1minate the motion at Docket Numbers \n31, 48, 58,61 & 66 from the list of open motions. \nDated: April 30, 2019 \nChief Judge \nBY ECF TO ALL COUNSEL \n82 ",
