The Joint Stipulation states that on January 20, 2021, the Acting Secretary of the Department for Homeland Security (\"DHS\") issued a memorandum directing DHS components-such as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\")-to conduct a review of policies and practices concerning immigration enforcement. Pursuant to the memorandum, ICE is reviewing the Directive at issue in this case. Joint Stipulation 107 . The parties therefore request that the court continue the upcoming hearing on the Motion to Dismiss and extend discovery by 120 days to \"conserve judicial and the parties' resources, as any actions that ICE may take regarding the Directive may change the contours of the issues in this case.\" Id. The court GRANTS the Joint Stipulation 107 insofar as it seeks to extend discovery by 120 days and to vacate the upcoming hearing date.Rather than continue the hearing date, however, the court DENIES the Motion to Dismiss 65 without prejudice. After that motion was fully briefed, the First Circuit granted Defendants' interlocutory appeal of the preliminary injunction entered in this matter. USCA Opinion 97 . In doing so, the First Circuit addressed some of the issues raised in the Motion to Dismiss. In light of that Opinion, the requested continuance, and the potential changes to \"the contours of the issues in this case,\" updated briefing would be helpful to the court if the action proceeds. Accordingly, no later than May 10, 2021, the parties shall report on the status of the case, and, if Plaintiffs are proceeding on the Complaint 1 as filed, shall propose a briefing schedule for any renewed motion to dismiss. The court notes further that the First Circuit reserved judgment as to whether a Massachusetts common-law privilege prohibits civil courthouse arrests and, if so, whether the Directive interferes with Massachusetts' power to operate its judiciary. USCA Opinion 36-48 97 . In the status report (or earlier), the parties shall advise the court on their view as to whether this question should be certified to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.

    "summary": "<p>On April 29, 2019, the Middlesex County District Attorney, Suffolk County District Attorney, Committee for Public Counsel Services (“CPCS”), and the Chelsea Collaborative, Inc., filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The plaintiffs sued U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”), U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and several officials under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C), and the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1226(a), 1357(a). The plaintiffs sought declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief, claiming violations of common-law privilege against civil arrests in courthouses and the Tenth Amendment. The plaintiffs alleged that in 2017, ICE authorized a nationwide campaign to target state courthouses as sites for civil-immigration enforcement. The plaintiffs further alleged that this policy undermined the administration of justice in Massachusetts, as many permanent residents refused to appear in court out of fear of ICE interference. The case was assigned to Judge Indira Talwani.</p><p>On April 29, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction that sought to enjoin ICE from authorizing and conducting civil arrests on parties, witnesses, and others attending Massachusetts courthouses on official business. The plaintiffs alleged that by authorizing civil arrests in courthouses, ICE ignored the well-settled common-law privilege against such civil arrests and exceeded its statutory jurisdiction under the Immigrant and Nationality Act. Thus, the practice is unlawful and should be set aside under the APA. While the motion included other claims, the plaintiffs sought preliminary injunctive relief only on this claim.</p><p>On May 15, 2019, the defendants filed an opposition to the motion for preliminary injunction. In the opposition, the defendants disputed the existence of a common-law privilege against civil arrest in courthouses. Furthermore, the defendants argued that even if the common-law privilege existed, Congress erased the privilege when it passed the INA. </p><p>On June 20, 2019, Judge Indira Talwani granted the plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction. 382 F. Supp. 3d 142. Judge Talwani found that plaintiffs had standing to bring the suit, were likely to succeed on the merits of their APA claim, and the injunction was of public interest. Thus, the defendants were enjoined from implementing the Courthouse Civil Arrest Directive and from civilly arresting parties, witnesses, and others attending Massachusetts courthouses on official business while they are going to, attending, or leaving the courthouse. The defendants appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. 19−1838.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the district court, the defendants filed a motion for dismiss for failure to state a claim on December 13, 2019. In response, the plaintiffs filed their opposition on January 31, 2020. </p><p>On September 1, 2020, the First Circuit vacated and remanded the preliminary injunction decision to the district court. The panel, which included Judges Toruella, Selya, and Kayatta, wrote that the plaintiffs failed to show a likelihood of success on the merits of their nonderogation theory, the theory that ICE's authorization of civil courthouse arrests exceeded ICE's statutory authority because the INA implicitly incorporated a common law privilege against courthouse arrests. The First Circuit additionally held that the plaintiffs had not yet shown a likelihood of success on their APA claim. As such, the court found that the district court's ruling constituted an abuse of discretion. 974 F.3d 9. Notably, the First Circuit reserved judgment as to whether a Massachusetts common-law privilege prohibits civil courthouse arrests and, if so, whether the ICE policy interfered with Massachusetts' power to operate its judiciary. </p><p>Back in the district court, discovery continued. But the dynamics in the case changed when the Biden Administration took office in January 2021, and shortly after, the acting secretary of the Department for Homeland Security directed ICE to conduct a review of policies and practices concerning immigration enforcement. Accordingly, on April 27, 2021, the acting directors of ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection and revoked the policy that had been the focus of this litigation. Then, on May 21, 2021, the plaintiffs filed a notice of voluntary dismissal without prejudice, as the policy revocation mooted the plaintiffs’ claims.</p><p>As of September 2021, the case does not appear to be ongoing. </p>",

The plaintiffs alleged that ICE's practice of conducting civil arrests inside state courthouses violated their common-law privilege against such arrests and Tenth Amendment Rights. In June 2019, Judge Indira Talwani granted the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction and enjoined ICE from continuing with this practice. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed this order. After the Biden Administration revoked the policy that prompted this lawsuit, the plaintiffs filed a notice of voluntary dismissal. ",

(collectively “Plaintiffs”) bring this lawsuit against U.S. Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement (“ICE”), U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), and several \nofficials in their official capacity (collectively “Defendants”), challenging ICE’s policy and \npractice of conducting civil immigration arrests inside of state courthouses in Massachusetts. In \nCount 1 of the Complaint [1], Plaintiffs challenge ICE Directive No. 11072.1, entitled “Civil \nImmigration Actions Inside Courthouses” (the “Courthouse Civil Arrest Directive”), dated \nJanuary 10, 2018, under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). The APA \ncommands a reviewing court to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action . . . found to be . . . in \nexcess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.” Plaintiffs \ncontend that at the time the Immigration and Naturalization Act (“INA”) was enacted, all those \nappearing in court on official court business enjoyed a common law privilege against civil arrest. \nThey argue that the INA does not explicitly extinguish this common law privilege and therefore \nmust be interpreted to be constrained by it. Therefore, Plaintiffs contend, any ICE policies which \npermit civil courthouse arrests are in excess of the power granted by the INA and must be set \naside by the court.  \nDefendants dispute the existence of a common law privilege against civil arrest in \ncourthouses, and, alternatively, argue that any such privilege was superseded long before the \ncodification of the current immigration scheme. Further, Defendants argue, if such a privilege \nexisted in the past, Plaintiffs nonetheless lack both constitutional and prudential standing to bring \nthis claim. Finally, the government contends that if Plaintiffs do have standing and the common \nlaw privilege exists, Congress nonetheless extinguished the privilege when it passed the INA. \nPending before the court is Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction [5], which \nseeks to preliminarily enjoin Defendants from implementing the Courthouse Civil Arrest \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 51   Filed 06/20/19   Page 3 of 29\nDirective and from civilly arresting parties, witnesses, and others attending Massachusetts \ncourthouses on official business while they are going to, attending, or leaving the courthouse. \nFinding that Plaintiffs have standing to bring this suit, are likely to succeed on the merits of their \nAPA claim as to those not in federal or state custody when they arrive, and are likely to suffer \nirreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in \nPlaintiffs’ favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest, Plaintiffs’ Motion for a \nPreliminary Injunction [5] is ALLOWED. Defendants are enjoined from implementing the \nCourthouse Civil Arrest Directive and from civilly arresting parties, witnesses, and others \nattending Massachusetts courthouses on official business while they are going to, attending, or \nleaving the courthouse. The court’s order does not limit ICE’s criminal arrests of such \nindividuals or its civil arrests of individuals who are brought to Massachusetts courthouses while \nin state or federal custody. \nI.  Statutory and Regulatory Background \nIn 1952, Congress enacted the INA, governing, among other things, the presence of non-\ncitizens (deemed “aliens” in the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(3)) in the United States and the \nassociated procedures for removing those present in the United States without federal \nauthorization. See INA, Pub. L. No. 82-414, 66 Stat. 163 (1952). “Aliens may be removed if they \nwere inadmissible at the time of entry, have been convicted of certain crimes, or meet other \ncriteria set by federal law.” Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 396 (2012) (citing 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1227); 8 U.S.C. § 1227 (a)(1)(B) (an alien present in the United States whose nonimmigrant \nvisa has been revoked is deportable). “As a general rule, it is not a crime for a removable alien to \nremain present in the United States[,]” Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. at 407, and removal \nproceedings are civil, not criminal, even where criminal activity underlies the reason for \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 51   Filed 06/20/19   Page 4 of 29\nremoval. See id. at 396; see also 6 C. Gordon, S. Mailman, S. Yale-Loehr, & R.Y. Wada, \nImmigration Law and Procedure § 71.01[4][a] (Matthew Bender, rev. ed. 2016) (acknowledging \n“the uniform judicial view, reiterated in numerous Supreme Court and lower court holdings, ... \nthat [removal] is a civil consequence and is not regarded as criminal punishment”). \nSince first enacted, the INA has granted authority for arrests with and without warrants. \nINA § 242(a), codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a), provided that “[p]ending a determination of \ndeportability in the case of any alien . . . such alien may, upon warrant of the Attorney General, \nbe arrested and taken into custody.” INA § 242(a).1 INA § 287(a)(2), codified as 8 U.S.C. § \n1357(a)(2), authorized an immigration officer without a warrant, “to arrest any alien who in his \npresence or view is entering or attempting to enter the United States” unlawfully, or “to arrest \nany alien in the United States if [the officer] has reason to believe that the alien so arrested is in \nthe United States in violation of any such law or regulation and is likely to escape before a \nwarrant can be obtained for his arrest.” Id. § 287(a)(2).2 “Although 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(2) does \n                                                           \n1 In 1996, the provision for an arrest with a warrant was replaced by a substantively similar \nprovision. Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, 1997, PL 104–208, September 30, 1996, \n110 Stat 3009. As amended in 1996, 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a) provides:  \nOn a warrant issued by the Attorney General, an alien may be arrested and detained \npending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from the United States. Except \nas provided in subsection (c) and pending such decision, the Attorney General-- \n(1) may continue to detain the arrested alien; and \n(2) may release the alien on-- \n(A) bond of at least $1,500 with security approved by, and containing \nconditions prescribed by, the Attorney General; or \n(B) conditional parole; but \n(3) may not provide the alien with work authorization (including an “employment \nauthorized” endorsement or other appropriate work permit), unless the alien is \nlawfully admitted for permanent residence or otherwise would (without regard to \nremoval proceedings) be provided such authorization. \n8 U.S.C. § 1226(a). \n2 Congress also amended this section in 1996 to add laws regulating the “removal of aliens” to \nthe list of applicable laws one could be violating upon “entering or attempting to enter the United \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 51   Filed 06/20/19   Page 5 of 29\nnot, by its terms, reveal its ‘civil’ or ‘criminal” character,’” the First Circuit has determined that \nsuch arrests are civil. U.S. v. Encarnacion, 239 F.3d 395, 398 (1st Cir. 2001). \n “A principal feature of the removal system is the broad discretion exercised by \nimmigration officials.” Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. at 396. ICE instructs its agents and \nemployees on its discretionary enforcement priorities through publicly released memoranda from \nits director. On March 2, 2011, the then-director of ICE distributed a memorandum about civil \nimmigration enforcement priorities (hereinafter the “2011 Civil Enforcement Priorities \nMemorandum”) as they relate to the apprehension, detention, and removal of aliens. ICE Policy \nNumber 10072.1, 2011 Civil Enforcement Priorities Memorandum (Mar. 2, 2011). That \nmemorandum explained that ICE had resources to remove each year less than four percent of the \nestimated removable population, and thus would prioritize its resources. Id. According to ICE, its \ntop civil enforcement priority was the removal of “Priority 1” aliens: “[a]liens who pose a danger \nto national security or a risk to public safety.” Id. at 1.  \nThese aliens include, but are not limited to: aliens engaged in or suspected of \nterrorism or espionage, or who otherwise pose a danger to national security; aliens \n                                                           \nStates[.]” Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, 1997, PL 104–208, September 30, 1996, \n110 Stat 3009. Other than that change, 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(2), is the same as when the INA was \nfirst enacted in 1952, and provides: \n(a) Powers without warrant \nAny officer or employee of the Service authorized under regulations prescribed by the \nAttorney General shall have power without warrant— \n… \n(2) to arrest any alien who in his presence or view is entering or attempting to \nenter the United States in violation of any law or regulation made in pursuance of \nlaw regulating the admission, exclusion, expulsion, or removal of aliens, or to \narrest any alien in the United States, if he has reason to believe that the alien so \narrested is in the United States in violation of any such law or regulation and is \nlikely to escape before a warrant can be obtained for his arrest, but the alien \narrested shall be taken without unnecessary delay for examination before an \nofficer of the Service having authority to examine aliens as to their right to enter \nor remain in the United States[.] \n8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(2). \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 51   Filed 06/20/19   Page 6 of 29\nconvicted of crimes, with a particular emphasis on violent criminals, felons, and \nrepeat offenders; aliens not younger than 16 years of age who participated in \norganized criminal gangs; aliens subject to outstanding criminal warrants; and \naliens who otherwise pose a serious risk to public safety. \n \n Id. at 1-2. The memorandum notes that the provision concerning those who otherwise pose a \nserious risk to public safety “is not intended to be read broadly, and officers, agents, and \nattorneys should rely on this provision only when serious and articulable public safety issues \nexist.” Id. at 2, n. 1. After those “Priority 1” aliens, ICE prioritizes the apprehension and removal \nof “[r]ecent illegal entrants” and “[a]liens who are fugitives or otherwise obstruct immigration \ncontrols.” Id. at 2.  \nOn June 17, 2011, the then-director of ICE distributed a memorandum entitled \n“Prosecutorial Discretion: Certain Victims, Witnesses, and Plaintiffs” (hereinafter “Prosecutorial \nDiscretion Memo”), Ex. C [28-3], directing ICE officers and attorneys to “exercise all \nappropriate prosecutorial discretion” in removal cases “to minimize any effect that immigration \nenforcement may have on the willingness and ability of victims, witnesses, and plaintiffs to call \npolice and pursue justice.” Id. at 2. According to this memorandum, “it is against ICE policy to \ninitiate removal proceedings against an individual known to be the immediate victim or witness \nto a crime.” Id. “Absent special circumstances, it is similarly against ICE policy to remove \nindividuals in the midst of a legitimate effort to protect their civil rights or civil liberties.” Id. at \n3. The memorandum continued that “[t]o avoid deterring individuals from reporting crimes and \nfrom pursuing actions to protect their civil rights, ICE officers, special agents, and attorneys are \nreminded to exercise all appropriate discretion on a case-by-case basis when making detention \nand enforcement decisions in the cases of victims of crime, witnesses to crime, and individuals \npursuing legitimate civil rights complaints.” Id. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 51   Filed 06/20/19   Page 7 of 29\nIn 2014, ICE addressed the application of these 2011 policies to “[e]nforcement actions at \nor near courthouses.” Enforcement Actions at or Near Courthouses Memorandum (hereinafter \nthe “2014 Courthouse Memorandum”) Ex. B [28-2]. In that memorandum, ICE specified that \n“[e]nforcement actions at or near courthouses will only be undertaken against Priority 1 aliens, \nas described in [the 2011 Enforcement Priorities Memorandum].” Id. Further, courthouse \nenforcement actions, would “only take place against specific, targeted aliens, rather than \nindividuals who may be ‘collaterally’ present, such as family members or friends who may \naccompany the target alien to court appearances or functions.” Id. at 2. The memorandum \ndirected further that “whenever practicable,” such actions will be taken outside of public areas of \nthe courthouse. Id. \nOn January 25, 2017, the President issued an executive order, entitled “Enhancing Public \nSafety in the Interior of the United States.” Exec. Order No. 13,768, 82 Fed. Reg. 8,799 (Jan. 30, \n2017). Of particular relevance to this case, section five of the Executive Order orders the \nSecretary of Homeland Security to prioritize the removal of removable aliens who “[h]ave been \ncharged with any criminal offense, where such charge has not been resolved” and “[a]re subject \nto a final order of removal, but who have not complied with their legal obligation to depart the \nUnited States.” 3 Id. On February 20, 2017, the then-Secretary of Homeland Security \n                                                           \n3 The Executive Order also instructs the Secretary to prioritize the removal of aliens described in \n8 U.S.C. §§ 1182 (a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(6)(C), 1225, and 1227 (a)(2) and (4). These individuals  \nare inadmissible or deportable due to criminal convictions, are in or attempting to enter the \nUnited States to commit espionage, attempted to obtain admission through fraud, or are subject \nto expedited removal. See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182 (a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(6)(C), 1225, and 1227 (a)(2) \nand (4). The Executive Order further instructs the Secretary to prioritize the removal of \nremovable aliens who: \n“(a) [h]ave been convicted of any criminal offense; . . . (c) [h]ave committed acts \nthat constitute a chargeable criminal offense; (d) [h]ave engaged in fraud or willful \nmisrepresentation in connection with any official matter or application before a \ngovernmental agency; (e) [h]ave abused any program related to receipt of public \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 51   Filed 06/20/19   Page 8 of 29\nimplemented that Executive Order and issued a memorandum entitled “Enforcement of the \nImmigration Laws to Serve the National Interest” (hereinafter the “2017 Memorandum”). 2017 \nMemorandum Ex. 9 [7-9]. The 2017 Memorandum directed ICE to prioritize the removal of \naliens in accordance with the Executive Order, including aliens who “have been charged with \nany criminal offense that has not been resolved” and “are subject to a final order of removal but \nhave not complied with their legal obligation to depart the United States.” Id. at 3. The 2017 \nMemorandum rescinded, with exceptions not relevant here, “all existing conflicting directives, \nmemoranda, or field guidance regarding the enforcement of our immigration laws and priorities \nfor removal . . . to the extent of the conflict [with the 2017 Memorandum].” Id.  \nOn January 10, 2018, ICE issued Directive No. 11072.1, the Courthouse Civil Arrest \nDirective. Compl. Ex. D [1-4]. The Courthouse Civil Arrest Directive refers to the 2017 \nMemorandum and explains that ICE civil immigration enforcement actions inside courthouses \ninclude actions “against specific, targeted aliens with criminal convictions, gang members, \nnational security or public safety threats, aliens who have been ordered removed from the United \nStates but have failed to depart, and aliens who have re-entered the country illegally after being \nremoved, when ICE officers or agents have information that leads them to believe the targeted \naliens are present at that specific location.” Id. at 2. According to the policy, ICE will not arrest \naliens other than the “target alien . . . absent special circumstances, such as where the individual \nposes a threat to public safety or interferes with ICE’s enforcement actions.” Id. The Courthouse \nCivil Arrest Directive explains that the purpose of this policy, in part, is to “reduce safety risks” \n                                                           \nbenefits; . . . or (g) [i]n the judgment of an immigration officer, otherwise pose a \nrisk to public safety or national security.”  \nExec. Order No. 13,768, 82 Fed. Reg. 8,799 (Jan. 30, 2017). \n \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 51   Filed 06/20/19   Page 9 of 29\nbecause “[i]ndividuals entering courthouses are typically screened by law enforcement personnel \nto search for weapons and other contraband.” Id. \nAll of the foregoing relates to civil arrests for removal purposes, not criminal arrests. In \n1990, the INA was amended to allow immigration officers to make warrantless criminal arrests. \nPub.L. 101-649, Title V, § 503(a), (b)(1), Nov. 29, 1990, 104 Stat. 5048, 5049, codified at 8 \nU.S.C. 1357(a)(4). Those arrests, unlike arrests under § 1357(a)(2), require that the alien be \nbrought before a magistrate judge, rather than an immigration officer. See U.S. v. Encarnacion, \n239 F.3d at 398; see also Morales v. Chadbourne, 793 F.3d 208, 214-16 (1st Cir. 2015) (noting \nthat “criminal custody” and ICE enforcement are different contexts). Plaintiffs’ APA claim does \nnot challenge ICE’s authority to conduct criminal arrests.  \nII.  The Record Before the Court Concerning Courthouse Arrests in Massachusetts State \nCourts \nIn July 2017, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court released a decision about civil \nimmigration detainers, holding that “Massachusetts law provides no authority for Massachusetts \ncourt officers to arrest and hold an individual solely on the basis of a Federal civil immigration \ndetainer, beyond the time that the individual would otherwise be entitled to be released from \nState custody.” Lunn v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 517, 537 (2017). \nThe Massachusetts Trial Court subsequently promulgated a policy entitled “Policy and \nProcedures Regarding Interactions with the Department of Homeland Security [“DHS\"].” Mass. \nTrial Ct. Policy at 16-18 [46-1], effective November 13, 2017. The Policy is directed to civil, not \ncriminal, enforcement action, specifically noting that nothing in the policy abrogates a court \nofficer’s authority to detain an individual pursuant to a criminal detainer or a warrant authorizing \nthe arrest of an individual for a criminal offense. Id. at 16. According to the policy, \nMassachusetts Trial Court employees are required to respond to DHS requests for information \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 51   Filed 06/20/19   Page 10 of 29\nabout an individual's case or probation in the same manner as a request by any other member of \nthe public. Id. DHS officials “may enter a courthouse and perform their official duties provided \nthat their conduct in no way disrupts or delays court operations, or compromises safety or \ndecorum.” Id. As applicable to all law enforcement officers, when an armed DHS official enters \na courthouse, courthouse security personnel are directed to ask him or her the official law \nenforcement purpose for entering the courthouse and the proposed enforcement action to be \ntaken, and that information is to be transmitted to a judicial officer if DHS officials state an \nintent to take into custody a party or other participant in a case before a judge or magistrate, or a \nperson attending to business in the courthouse. Id.  \nThe Policy includes separate procedures for individuals in custody, and those not in \ncustody. Under the policy, individuals who are brought into court in custody, and are subject to \nrelease after a court proceeding, should be processed in the normal course, even if there is an \nimmigration detainer. Id. Court employees do not have the authority to comply with or serve \ncivil immigration warrants, but DHS officials are permitted to enter the holding cell area to take \ncustody if the DHS official presents a civil arrest warrant or detainer and the court officer \nsupervisor determines that the DHS official would otherwise take custody of the individual \ninside or immediately outside of the courthouse. Id.  \nAs to individuals coming to court who are not in custody, under the Policy, trial court \nemployees may not impede or assist DHS in the physical act of taking such individuals into DHS \ncustody. Id. DHS officials shall not be permitted to take an individual into custody pursuant to a \ncivil immigration detainer or warrant in a courtroom, absent advance permission by a judicial \nofficer. Id. The policy also requires court security personnel to draft an incident report for every \ninstance in which DHS takes an individual into custody in the courthouse. Id. \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 51   Filed 06/20/19   Page 11 of 29\nIn support of their motion, Plaintiffs submitted affidavits from the executive director of \nthe Chelsea Collaborative, Vega Decl. Ex. 10 [7-10], an immigration law specialist from the \nImmigration Impact Unit at CPCS, Klein Decl. Ex. 11 [7-11], the Chief of Victim Witness \nServices for the Middlesex County DA’s office, Foley Decl. Ex. 12 [7-12], the executive director \nof Lawyers for Civil Rights, an organization providing pro bono legal representation to \nimmigrants, Espinoza-Madrigal Decl. Ex 13 [7-13], and a legal advocacy specialist with \nHarberCOV, an organization that provides services to people affected by abuse, Moshier Decl. \nEx. 14 [7-14]. These affidavits aver that ICE is civilly arresting people at courthouses throughout \nMassachusetts. Espinoza-Madrigal Decl. ¶ 7, Ex. 13 [7-13]; Klein Decl. ¶ 6, Ex. 11 [7-11]. \nCPCS “regularly receives calls from defense counsel detailing incidents in which ICE arrests an \nindividual outside the courthouse prior to entering the courthouse for their trial or pre-trial \nhearing.” Klein Decl. ¶ 7, Ex. 11 [7-11]. Plaintiffs allege that these arrests are disruptive of civil \nand criminal proceedings. For example, Plaintiffs describe an arrest by two ICE officers at \nSomerville District Court as “look[ing] like a fistfight had broken out” and noting that court \nofficers had to get involved to end the confrontation. Foley Decl. ¶ 7, Ex. 12 [7-12]. Plaintiffs \nreport that prior to ICE targeting courthouses for enforcement actions, “noncitizen[s]…who were \npotentially removable” “did not express concern about appearing in court as plaintiffs, victims, \nor witnesses[,]” but now, noncitizens are reluctant to attend court in any capacity, “explicitly \npointing to the presence of ICE in the courts.” Vega Decl. ¶¶ 6-10, Ex. 10 [7-10]. The Middlesex \nVictim Witness Services office reports that “noncitizen victims and witnesses frequently express \nconcerns about ICE’s presence and deportation.” Foley Decl. ¶ 6, Ex. 12 [7-12]. Individuals \nidentified by the declarant as “permanent residents” have reported fear seeking the court’s \nassistance for help with domestic violence concerns. Moshier Decl. ¶ 6, Ex. 14 [7-14]. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 51   Filed 06/20/19   Page 12 of 29\n“[Chelsea] Collaborative members who have been victims of employer abuse and wage theft \nhave also refused to seek court intervention because of their fears of ICE presence in the \ncourthouses.” Vega Decl. ¶ 14, Ex. 10 [7-10].  \nDefendants represented at the hearings on this motion that “generally” ICE is not \narresting people prior to their participation in hearings and is not targeting witnesses or victims. \nDefendants did not submit any countervailing affidavits, but submitted a copy of responses \nposted on a DHS website to frequently asked questions on sensitive locations policy and \ncourthouse arrests. ICE Frequently Asked Questions on Sensitive Locations and Courthouse \nArrests, as printed on May 6, 2019 (hereinafter “FAQ Responses”) [46-1]. According to the FAQ \nResponses, “ICE does not view courthouses as a sensitive location,” ICE has “for some time had \nestablished practices in place related to civil immigration enforcement inside courthouses,” and \n“the increasing unwillingness of some jurisdictions to cooperate with ICE in the safe and orderly \ntransfer of targeted aliens inside their prisons and jails has necessitated additional at large \narrests.” FAQ Responses at 8-9 [46-1]. The FAQ Responses note further that “[f]ederal, state, \nand local law enforcement officials routinely engage in enforcement activity in courthouses \nthroughout the country,” that the actions “are consistent with longstanding law enforcement \npractices nationwide,” and that because individuals entering courthouses are typically screened \nfor weapons, “civil immigration enforcement actions taken inside courthouses can reduce safety \nrisks to the public, targeted alien(s), and ICE officers and agents.” Id. at 9. The FAQ Responses \nstate further that these arrests “are the result of targeted enforcement actions against specific \naliens.” Id. at 10. The FAQ Responses also state that “ICE makes every effort to ensure that the \narrest occurs after the matter for which the alien was appearing in court has concluded.” Id. \nIII.   Plaintiffs’ Standing \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 51   Filed 06/20/19   Page 13 of 29\n“Article III of the Constitution confines the judicial power of federal courts to deciding \nactual ‘Cases’ or ‘Controversies.’” Hollingsworth v. Perry, 570 U.S. 693, 704 (2013). \nAccordingly, the court turns first to Defendants’ challenge to Plaintiffs’ constitutional and \nprudential standing to bring their APA claim. Defs.’ Br. at 6-11 [28]. \nA.  Plaintiffs’ Constitutional Standing \nIn order to satisfy the “irreducible constitutional minimum” of Article III standing, Lujan \nv. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992), a “plaintiff must have (1) suffered an injury \nin fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely \nto be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.” Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 \n(2016). “To establish injury in fact, a plaintiff must show that he or she suffered ‘an invasion of a \nlegally protected interest’ that is ‘concrete and particularized’ and ‘actual or imminent, not \nconjectural or hypothetical.’” Id. at 1548. “The injury need not be ‘significant’; a ‘small’ stake in \nthe outcome will suffice, if it is ‘direct.’” Dubois v. U.S. Dep't of Agric., 102 F.3d 1273, 1281 \n(1st Cir. 1996) (quoting U.S. v. Students Challenging Regulatory Agency Procedures (SCRAP), \n412 U.S. 669, 689 n. 14 (1973)). “[A] federal court [may] act only to redress injury that fairly \ncan be traced to the challenged action of the defendant, and not injury that results from the \nindependent action of some third party not before the court.” Simon v. E. Kentucky Welfare \nRights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 41–42 (1976). The government argues that Plaintiffs lack an “injury in \nfact” and that the Plaintiffs’ injuries are not traceable to the Courthouse Civil Arrest Directive. \nDefs.’ Br. at 8-11 [34]. \nThe court considers Plaintiffs’ injury-in-fact first. Defendants argue that Plaintiffs do not \nface a threat that the Courthouse Civil Arrest Directive will be applied against them, and \nmoreover, that they have no right to assert a claim against removal on behalf of others who may \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 51   Filed 06/20/19   Page 14 of 29\nbe subject to such removal. Id. at 8. But this is not the injury that Plaintiffs are claiming. \nPlaintiffs “are not asserting incidental injury from Defendants’ general enforcement of the \nimmigration laws, but direct injury from Defendants’ actions targeting courts for federal \nimmigration enforcement.” Pls.’ Rep. Br. at 9 [41]. Defendants aptly summarize the DAs’ \ncomplaints that “the ICE Directive increases their costs, diverts their resources, and makes their \nprosecutions more ‘time consuming and difficult.’” Defs.’ Br. at 9 [34] (citing Compl. ¶¶ 80, 82 \n[1]). The DAs claim that ICE civil arrests in state courthouses, the sole forum in which they can \nprosecute cases, are hindering the DAs’ ability to carry out their primary functions as District \nAttorneys, and Chelsea Collaborative claims that these civil arrests impair their members’ ability \nto protect themselves through the state courts from unlawful actions of other individuals. For \nexample, Plaintiffs allege that survivors of domestic abuse are “reluctant to file for civil \nprotective orders against abusive partners or appear [in] court as witnesses in criminal cases \nagainst their abusers.” Moshier Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. 14 [7-14]. Fears concerning ICE’s presence from \nvictims and witnesses “have been more prevalent since the ICE policy was announced.” Foley \nDecl. ¶ 6, Ex. 12 [7-12]. Victim Witness Advocates can no longer advise victims that their fear \nof arrest during the court process is unfounded. Foley Decl. ¶¶ 4-5, Ex. 12 [7-12].  \nDefendants argue that a state prosecutor does not suffer an injury in fact merely because a \nfederal law-enforcement action (or threat of it) increases the time or costs associated with state \nprosecutions, and assert that they know of no case in which a court has found standing to \nchallenge a federal law on this basis. Defendant conflates two issues, however. Federal \nprosecutions may well routinely burden state prosecutions (or vice versa), without there being a \nlegal claim that may be asserted. But the inquiry here is whether there is a cognizable injury for \npurposes of Article III standing. The court agrees with Plaintiffs that being unable to reliably \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 51   Filed 06/20/19   Page 15 of 29\nsecure the attendance of defendants, victims, and witnesses hinders the ability of the DAs to \nprosecute crimes and Chelsea Collaborative’s members to secure their rights under state law and \namounts to a particularized injury sufficient to constitute injury-in-fact. See Matter of C. Doe, \nNo. SJ-2018-119 at 10-11 (Mass. Sept. 18, 2018), Ex. 7 [7-7] (“[T]he administration of justice in \nthe Commonwealth suffers when litigants, witnesses, and others with business before the courts \nare afraid to come near a Massachusetts courthouse because they fear being arrested by \nimmigration authorities.”). \nCPCS alleges that ICE’s implementation of the Courthouse Civil Arrest Directive and the \nfear generated by courthouse arrests is impeding CPCS’ representation of its clients and its \nability to manage its expenses. CPCS’s core function of representing criminal defendants is \nimpeded when its clients are apprehended by ICE prior to appearing in court and proceedings are \ninterrupted or altogether cannot continue. That alone is enough to constitute injury-in-fact. \nFurther, CPCS declares that “time and resources have been consumed by…assisting defense \nattorneys whose clients have been impacted by this ICE enforcement policy.” Klein Decl. ¶ 4, \nEx. 11 [7-11]. CPCS has alleged a concrete and particularized injury sufficient to constitute \ninjury-in-fact. \nThough Defendants cite to several cases in support of their challenge to Plaintiffs’ \nstanding, none are applicable here.4 The court finds that the injuries alleged by the Plaintiffs \nsatisfy the Article III injury-in-fact requirements.  \n                                                           \n4 New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144 (1992), does not address the requirements for \nstanding. In Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447 (1923), the Court held that the state did not \nhave standing to sue because the provisions in the challenged statute were voluntary. Plaintiffs \nhere are not suing under similar circumstances. Virginia ex rel. Cuccinelli v. Sebelius, 656 F.3d \n253 (4th Cir. 2011), is also inapplicable, because, in that case, Virginia passed a “non-binding \ndeclaration,” id. at 270, declaring its opposition to a federal statute and then sued based on the \nconflict between its declaration and the federal law.  \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 51   Filed 06/20/19   Page 16 of 29\nAs to traceability, the government argues that each Plaintiff’s injury is not traceable to \nthe Courthouse Civil Arrest Directive because it results from “third-party aliens’ decisions not to \nattend Massachusetts courts in an effort to evade arrest and removal proceedings.” Defs.’ Br. at \n10 [34]. “This wrongly equates injury ‘fairly traceable’ to the defendant with injury as to which \nthe defendant's actions are the very last step in the chain of causation.” Bennett v. Spear, 520 \nU.S. 154, 168–69 (1997). The unwillingness of those at risk of ICE civil arrest to visit \ncourthouses injures the DAs and Chelsea Collaborative members and is alleged be a direct result \nof the Courthouse Civil Arrest Directive. The DAs report that concerns from witnesses and \nvictims about ICE’s presence “have been more prevalent since the ICE policy was announced.” \nFoley Decl. ¶ 6, Ex. 12 [7-12]. Before ICE began civilly arresting people at courthouses, Chelsea \nCollaborative helped members file suit, and helped members in litigation by filling courtrooms \nwith supporters. Vega Decl. ¶ 6, Ex. 10 [7-10]. Now, Chelsea Collaborative struggles to persuade \nnoncitizen members to go to court as victims, witnesses, or supporters. Vega Decl. ¶ 9, Ex. 10 [7-\n10]. According to Chelsea Collaborative, the “reluctance to attend court began soon after ICE’s \nincrease in targeted enforcement actions in courthouses.” Id. The Courthouse Civil Arrest \nDirective “has caused a strain both on [Chelsea Collaborative’s] personnel and [their] budget \nsuch that [they] are unable to effectively carry out many of [their] other goals and missions.” \nVega Decl. ¶ 22, Ex. 10 [7-10]. The injuries alleged by the DAs and Chelsea Collaborative are \ntraceable to the Courthouse Civil Arrest Directive. Accordingly, the DAs and Chelsea \nCollaborative each have standing to bring this case.  \nThe government argues that CPCS’s “alleged injuries are caused by third-party aliens’ \ndecisions not to attend Massachusetts courts in an effort to evade arrest and removal \nproceedings.” Defs.’ Br. at 11 [34]. However, CPCS is not complaining that its clients are \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 51   Filed 06/20/19   Page 17 of 29\nvoluntarily choosing not to attend court, but that ICE is civilly arrested their clients when these \nindividuals come to state court to attend state proceedings against them. These arrests cause \nCPCS to expend resources to respond to civil courthouse immigration enforcement. CPCS \ncontends that defense attorneys inside courthouses regularly discover that clients are arrested \nprior to entering the courthouse to appear at criminal proceedings, causing a default judgment to \nenter. Klein Decl. ¶ 7, Ex. 11 [7-11]. CPCS’s cognizable injuries are traceable to ICE’s \ncourthouse arrest policy, and not to a third party. Therefore, CPCS also has standing to bring this \ncase. \nB.  Plaintiffs’ Prudential Standing \n“The doctrine of standing also includes prudential concerns relating to the proper exercise \nof federal jurisdiction.” Dubois v. U.S. Dep't of Agric., 102 F.3d 1273, 1281 (1st Cir. 1996). \n“The interest [Plaintiffs] assert[] must be ‘arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or \nregulated by the statute’ that [Plaintiffs allege] was violated.” Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band \nof Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, 224-25 (2012) (noting that the prudential \nstanding test “is not meant to be especially demanding”) (internal citation omitted). “In cases \nwhere the plaintiff is not itself the subject of the contested regulatory action, the test denies a \nright of review if the plaintiff's interests are so marginally related to or inconsistent with the \npurposes implicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress intended to \npermit the suit.” Clarke v. Sec. Indus. Ass'n, 479 U.S. 388, 399 (1987). Plaintiffs, therefore, need \nnot be the target of ICE civil arrests or enforcement, but merely have interests that are more than \n“marginally related” to ICE enforcement in courthouses. The Plaintiffs here, as participants in \nthe state civil and criminal justice systems, represent stakeholders affected by civil immigration \narrests in state courthouses. Though no specified Congressional intent to include Plaintiffs in the \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 51   Filed 06/20/19   Page 18 of 29\nzone of interest of the INA is needed, Clarke, 479 U.S. at 399-400, Congress nonetheless \nindicated its preference that federal immigration enforcement not impede state criminal law \nenforcement. The INA specifies that the federal government “may not remove an alien who is \nsentenced to imprisonment until the alien is released from imprisonment.” 8 U.S.C. § 1231 \n(a)(4)(A). Considering this provision as an example, the low threshold necessary to satisfy the \nzone of interest test, and the plain interests of prosecutors, criminal defense attorneys, and an \norganization serving immigrants in the proper enforcement of immigration laws within \ncourthouses, the court finds that Plaintiffs are within the statute’s zone of interest and therefore \nhave standing to pursue this case. \nIV.  Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction  \nHaving found that Plaintiffs have standing to bring their APA claim, the court turns to \nPlaintiffs’ motion. “A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is likely to \nsucceed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary \nrelief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public \ninterest.” Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  \nA.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \n1.  Common Law Privilege Against Civil Courthouse Arrests \nIn England, for many centuries prior to the founding of the United States, civil litigants \ncommenced their suits by having a civil defendant arrested. See Clinton W. Francis, Practice, \nStrategy, and Institution: Debt Collection in the English Common-Law Courts, 1740-1840, 80 \nNw. U. L. Rev. 807, 810 (1986); see also Nathan Levy, Jr., Mesne Process in Personal Actions at \nCommon Law and the Power Doctrine, 78 Yale L. J. 52, 61 (1968) (In England, “arrest [was] the \nusual mode of beginning suit”). “[P]ersons so charged [in civil litigation] could be arrested \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 51   Filed 06/20/19   Page 19 of 29\nanywhere in England and brought within the custody of the [court].” Nathan Levy, Jr., Mesne \nProcess in Personal Actions at Common Law and the Power Doctrine, 78 Yale L. J. 52, 62 \n(1968). “At common law, the writ of capias ad respondendum directed the sheriff to secure the \ndefendant’s appearance by taking him into custody.” Murphy Bros., Inc. v. Michetti Pipe \nStringing, Inc., 526 U.S. 344 (1999). The courts recognized that permitting arrests at courthouses \nof those attending court on other matters could chill attendance at those other proceedings. See \nThe King v. Holy Trinity in Wareham, 99 Eng. Rep. 531 (1782) (“for the purposes of justice” \nthose attending court proceedings were privileged from being arrested on civil process); Meekins \nv. Smith, 126 Eng. Rep. 363 (1791) (same).  \nThe United States imported that procedure of civil arrest and that common law privilege \nagainst civil arrest at courthouses into its judicial system. See Stewart v. Ramsay, 242 U.S. 128, \n130 (1916) (“[The privilege] is founded in the necessities of the judicial administration, which \nwould be often embarrassed, and sometimes interrupted, if the suitor might be vexed with \nprocess while attending upon the court for the protection of his rights, or the witness while \nattending to testify.”) (quoting Parker v. Hotchkiss, 18 F. Cas. 1137, 1138 (C.C.E.D. Pa. 1849)). \n“It has long been settled that parties and witnesses attending in good faith any legal tribunal, with \nor without a writ of protection, are privileged from arrest on civil process during their \nattendance, and for a reasonable time in going and returning.” Larned v. Griffin, 12 F. 590, 590 \n(C.C.D. Mass 1882). The United States Constitution recognizes a similar privilege from civil \narrest during legislative proceedings, stating that members of Congress are “privileged from \nArrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and \nreturning from the same.” U.S. CONST. art. I, § 6, cl. 1. In explaining this clause in his treatise on \nthe Constitution, Justice Storey underscored the fundamental nature of the privilege against \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 51   Filed 06/20/19   Page 20 of 29\ncourthouse arrests, noting that “[t]his privilege is conceded by law to the humblest suitor and \nwitness in a court of justice.” Williamson v. United States, 207 U.S. 425, 443 (1908) (quoting \nJOSEPH STORY, COMMENTARIES ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES, (1883)). Indeed, \ncourts in the United States have recognized that “justice requires the attendance of witnesses \ncognizant of material facts, and hence that no unreasonable obstacles ought to be thrown in the \nway of their freely coming into court to give oral testimony.” Diamond v. Earle, 217 Mass. 499, \n501 (1914).  \nThe writ of capias ad respondendum eventually gave way to personal service of \nsummons or other form of notice. International Shoe Co. v. Wash., 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945). As \nthe preferred means for obtaining a civil defendant’s presence in a lawsuit changed from a civil \narrest to a summons and civil process, state and federal courts recognized the need for that \nprivilege’s continued applicability, though this procedure was even less intrusive than a civil \narrest. See Page Co. v. MacDonald, 261 U.S. 446, 448 (1923) (recognizing the importance of this \nprivilege and the “necessity of its inflexibility”); Stewart v. Ramsay, 242 U.S. 128, 130 (1916) \n(citing with approval Parker v. Hotchkiss, 18 F. Cas. at 1138 and applying the privilege against \narrest in a courthouse to being served with a summons while attending a court proceeding); \nDiamond v. Earle, 217 Mass. 499, 501 (1914) (exempting courthouse attendees from service of \ncivil process). Such an “absolutely indispensable”  privilege, Williamson, 207 U.S. at 443 \n(quoting JOSEPH STORY, COMMENTARIES ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES (1883)), \nso fundamental to the functioning of both federal and state judiciary, cannot be assumed to have \ndisappeared simply with the passage of time. The court therefore concludes that a privilege \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 51   Filed 06/20/19   Page 21 of 29\nagainst civil arrest remained present at common law when Congress enacted the provisions at \nissue here.5  \n2.  Merits of the Administrative Procedures Act Claim \nPlaintiffs argue that this common law privilege against civil arrests of court attendees was \nnot abrogated by Congress and that the Courthouse Civil Arrest Directive therefore exceeds \nICE’s authority and must be invalidated under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706 \n(2)(C). The APA instructs a reviewing court to “hold unlawful and set aside agency \naction…found to be…in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of \nstatutory right.” 5 U.S.C. § 706 (2)(C).  \n “Statutes which invade the common law are to be read with a presumption favoring the \nretention of long-established and familiar principles, except when a statutory purpose to the \ncontrary is evident.” United States v. Texas, 507 U.S. 529, 534 (1993) (quoting Isbrandtsen Co. \nv. Johnson, 343 U.S. 779, 783 (1952)) (quotation marks and alterations omitted). “In such cases, \nCongress does not write upon a clean slate.” Id. (citing Astoria Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. \nSolimino, 501 U.S. 104, 108, 111 (1991)). “This presumption is, however, no bar to a \nconstruction that conflicts with a common-law rule if the statute speaks directly to the question \naddressed by the common law.” Pasquantino v. United States, 544 U.S. 349, 359 (2005) (internal \nquotation marks, citations, and alterations omitted). Compare In re Gitto Glob. Corp., 422 F.3d 1, \n8 (1st Cir. 2005) (“Because [statute at issue] speaks directly to the question of public access, \nhowever, it supplants the common law for purposes of determining public access to papers filed \n                                                           \n5 The court notes, however, that the privilege is tied to the voluntary attendance of parties, \nwitnesses and others in the courthouse and to the necessities of judicial administration. Plaintiffs \noffer no authority for the proposition that this privilege extends to individuals who are brought to \nthe courthouse in federal or state custody. \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 51   Filed 06/20/19   Page 22 of 29\nin a bankruptcy case.”) with Beck v. Prupis, 529 U.S. 494, 504 (2000) (Holding that Congress \nintended to “adopt…well-established common-law…principles” where the statute offered no \nindication to the contrary). \nThe INA, as passed in 1952, did not “speak[] directly” to the common law privilege \nagainst civil arrest at the courthouse, nor did any subsequent amendments to the statute. The civil \narrest provisions, detailed above, provide for two types of civil arrest: with and without a \nwarrant. When the ICE has secured a warrant, the civil arrest provision permits that “an alien \nmay be arrested and detained pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from the \nUnited States.” 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a). Nothing in this provision or section of the statute speaks to \ncourthouse arrests in any way. See United States v. Texas, 507 U.S. at 534-35 (holding that the \nDebt Collection Act does not speak directly to the government’s common law right to collect \nprejudgment interest where the statute at issue uses the term “person” and does not specify that \n“person” includes states).  \nThe provision for warrantless civil arrests includes a specified list of when such arrests \nare appropriate. An ICE officer or employee may civilly arrest, without a warrant, “any alien…if \nhe has reason to believe that the alien so arrested is in the United States in violation of [an \nimmigration law or regulation] and is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained for his \narrest.” 8 U.S.C. § 1357 (a)(2). Like § 1226(a), this section does not address courthouse arrests \nor provide any basis for finding that Congress abrogated the common law privilege against civil \narrests in courthouses.  \nThe government argues that the INA supersedes all common law, that immigration law \npreempts state law, and that the federal government has the sole authority to control immigration. \nDefs.’ Br. at 20-22 [34]. The government’s arguments presume that Plaintiffs are seeking to alter \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 51   Filed 06/20/19   Page 23 of 29\nthe removal process, but that is not the relief Plaintiffs seek. Plaintiffs are not arguing for any \nchange in removal proceedings, but are simply contending that civil arrests at state courthouses \nare outside of the statutory authority granted to the government. Even with the comprehensive \nimmigration law system devised by Congress, there are some limits to how and where the \ngovernment can arrest those it seeks to remove, including the limits written into the statute \nitself.6  \nAt the second day of hearing, the government argued that 8 U.S.C. § 1229(e) \ndemonstrates Congress’s intent that the INA abrogate the privilege against courthouse arrests.7 \nSection 1229(e)(1) requires that, “[i]n cases where an enforcement action leading to a removal \nproceeding was taken against an alien at any of the locations specified in paragraph (2), the \nNotice to Appear shall include a statement that the provisions of section 1367 of this title have \nbeen complied with.” 8 U.S.C. § 1229(e)(1).8 One of those specified locations is “a \ncourthouse…if the alien is appearing in connection with a protection order case, child custody \ncase, or other civil or criminal case relating to domestic violence, sexual assault, trafficking, or \nstalking in which the alien has been battered or subject to extreme cruelty or if the alien is \n                                                           \n6 The DHS website answers the question “is it legal to arrest suspected immigration violators at a \ncourthouse,” with the assertion that “ICE officers and agents are expressly authorized by statute \nto make arrests of aliens where probable cause exists to believe that such aliens are removable.” \n[46-1]. In fact, warrantless civil arrests further require that the arresting officer believe the person \n“is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained for his arrest.” 8 U.S.C. § 1357 (a)(2). \n7 The cited paragraph is found in a section of the code entitled “Initiation of Removal \nProceedings,” and not in either section 8 U.S.C. § 1226, entitled “Apprehension and detention of \naliens,” where the provision concerning arrests with a warrant is found, or 8 U.S.C. § 1357, \nentitled “Powers of immigration officers and employees,” where provisions concerning \nwarrantless arrests are found. \n8 Section 1367, entitled “Penalties for disclosure of information,” prohibits ICE and other \nenforcement agencies from “mak[ing] an adverse determination of admissibility or \ndeportability…using information solely furnished by…a spouse or parent who has battered the \nalien or subjected the alien to extreme cruelty or others potentially complicit in the abuse of the \nalien or their family.” \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 51   Filed 06/20/19   Page 24 of 29\ndescribed in subparagraph (T) or (U) of section 1101(a)(15) of this title.” 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1229(e)(2)(B).  \nThese provisions were added in 2006. See Violence Against Women and Department of \nJustice Reauthorization Act, PL 109–162, January 5, 2006, 119 Stat 2960. “The views of a \nsubsequent Congress, however, form a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier one.” \nBilski v. Kappos, 561 U.S. 593, 645 (2010) (quoting United States v. Price, 361 U.S. 304, 313 \n(1960)) (internal quotation marks omitted). “When a later statute is offered as an expression of \nhow the Congress interpreted a statute passed by another Congress a half century before, such \ninterpretation has very little, if any, significance.” Bilski, 561 U.S. at 645 (citing Rainwater v. \nUnited States, 356 U.S. 590, 593 (1958)) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). The \n2006 enactment of the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act \nhas little bearing on the court’s interpretation of Congressional intent regarding courthouse \narrests in 1952, and certainly does not amount to a clearly stated intent to abrogate the common \nlaw privilege. See, e.g., Pasquantino, 544 U.S. at 359 (requiring Congress to clearly state its \nintent to abrogate the common law).  \nThe government also argues that “ICE has long exercised its arrest authority at and \naround courthouses….” Defs.’ Br. at 4 [34]; see also 2014 Courthouse Memorandum [28-2]. \nAnd the provisions of the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization \nAct do signal that immigration courthouse arrests were occurring by 2006, that Congress was \naware that those arrests were occurring, and that Congress did not legislate to cease those arrests. \n“But the significance of subsequent congressional action or inaction necessarily varies with the \ncircumstances, and finding any interpretive help in congressional behavior here is impossible.” \nUnited States v. Wells, 519 U.S. 482, 495 (1997). See also Star Athletica, L.L.C. v. Varsity \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 51   Filed 06/20/19   Page 25 of 29\nBrands, Inc., 137 S. Ct. 1002, 1015 (2017) (quoting Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation v. \nLTV Corp., 496 U.S. 633, 650 (1990)) (“‘Congressional inaction lacks persuasive significance’ \nin most circumstances.”). That this practice has been ongoing and that Congress has not halted \ncourthouse civil arrests does not alter the court’s understanding of the common law privilege \nagainst civil courthouse arrests at the time the INA civil arrest provisions were enacted, and the \nabsence of any clearly stated intent to abrogate that privilege at that time. Accordingly, the court \nfinds that Plaintiffs have a strong likelihood of success on the merits of their claim that \nCourthouse Civil Arrest Directive exceeds the authority granted to ICE by the Congress in the \ncivil arrest provisions of the INA and should be invalidated pursuant to the Administrative \nProcedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §  706(2)(C). \nB.  Irreparable Harm \n“Irreparable injury in the preliminary injunction context means an injury that cannot \nadequately be compensated for either by a later-issued permanent injunction, after a full \nadjudication on the merits, or by a later-issued damages remedy.” Rio Grande Cmty. Health Ctr., \nInc. v. Rullan, 397 F.3d 56, 76 (1st Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). “If the plaintiff \nsuffers a substantial injury that is not accurately measurable or adequately compensable by \nmoney damages, irreparable harm is a natural sequel.” Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. \nBaccarat, Inc., 102 F.3d 12, 19 (1st Cir. 1996). “‘District courts have broad discretion to evaluate \nthe irreparability of alleged harm and to make determinations regarding the propriety of \ninjunctive relief.’” K-Mart Corp. v. Oriental Plaza, Inc., 875 F.2d 907, 915 (1st Cir. 1989) \n(quoting Wagner v. Taylor, 836 F.2d 566, 575–76 (D.C.Cir.1987)). \nPlaintiffs argue they are suffering ongoing and irreparable harm. Pls.’ Mem at 17 [6]. \nSpecifically, Chelsea Collaborative argues the Courthouse Civil Arrest Directive forces the \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 51   Filed 06/20/19   Page 26 of 29\ndiversion of resources from their normal activities to “an extra-judicial mediation and dispute-\nresolution system.” Id. at 18. Chelsea Collaborative’s members are afraid to use the courts to \nvindicate their rights when they are victimized by employers, landlords, family members, and \nothers. Vega Decl. ¶ 9-10, Ex. 10 [7-10]. Chelsea Collaborative’s mediation program redirects \nefforts from other causes and, as a result, Chelsea Collaborative is “unable to effectively carry \nout many of [its] other goals and missions.” Id. at ¶ 22.  \nPlaintiffs claim the Courthouse Civil Arrest Directive interferes with the District \nAttorney’s ability to prosecute specific cases because victims and witnesses are scared to \nparticipate in the proceedings, Pls.’ Mem at 18-19 [6], and because ICE civilly arrests many non-\ntargeted individuals at courthouses. Klein Decl. ¶ 6, Ex. 11 [7-11]. For example, survivors of \ndomestic violence fear utilizing the court system in responding to abuse because of a fear of \nimmigration authorities at courthouses. Moshier Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. 14 [7-14]. Domestic violence \nperpetrators reinforce this fear when talking to survivors. Foley Decl. ¶ 5, Ex. 12 [7-12]. As a \nresult, survivors are “reluctant to file for civil protective orders against abusive partners.” \nMoshier Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. 14 [7-14]. Even complaints successfully filed may not be pursued if \nsurvivors fear returning to court to testify in their own cases. Id. at ¶ 6.  \nCPCS argues the Courthouse Civil Arrest Directive shifts their staff focus to assist \ncriminal defense attorneys in the process of navigating the potential immigration consequences \nof their client’s circumstances, often including helping counsel locate their client in ICE civil \ndetention. Pls.’ Mem at 19 [6]. CPCS expends resources “responding to the effects of courthouse \narrests, and… assisting defense attorneys whose clients have been impacted by this ICE \nenforcement policy.” Klein Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. 11 [7-11]. Further, when defendants with pending \ncharges are arrested in the courthouse before they can appear before a judge, a default is entered \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 51   Filed 06/20/19   Page 27 of 29\nagainst them. Id. at ¶ 9. A default can, among other things, cause “the denial of release on \nimmigration bond and denial of relief from removal.” Id. at ¶ 10. \nNone of the financial costs alleged by Plaintiffs could be recovered from the government \nin the event Plaintiffs succeed at trial. Further, Plaintiffs have made an unrebutted showing that \neach day that the threat of ICE civil arrests looms over Massachusetts courthouses impairs the \nDAs and CPCS ability to successfully perform their functions within the judicial system, and \nChelsea Collaborative’s members’ ability to enforce legal rights, and that absent an injunction, \nsome state criminal and civil cases may well go unprosecuted for lack of victim or witness \nparticipation. CPCS will continue to incur costs as defendants are civilly arrested when \nattempting to respond to criminal complaints. Criminal defendants will be unable to vindicate \ntheir rights if they are taken into ICE custody prior to appearing in court or if witnesses in their \ndefense are too fearful to visit a courthouse. None of these harms can be remedied after the \nconclusion of this litigation. Therefore, the court finds that the Plaintiffs have alleged irreparable \nharm sufficient to warrant and injunction. \nC.  Balance of Harms and Weighing of the Public Interest \nPlaintiffs accurately argue that when the government is the defendant in a case for which \na preliminary injunction is sought, the court may aggregate its consideration of the balance of \nharms and weighing of the public interest. Pls.’ Br. at 19 [6] (citing Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. \n418, 435 (2009)).  \nPlaintiffs contend that without an injunction, victims and witnesses will continue to avoid \nusing the state courts, leading to a failure of state civil and criminal proceedings, ultimately \nharming the rule of law. Over two days of hearing on this preliminary injunction, counsel for the \ngovernment repeatedly argued that ICE was not conducting courthouse arrests in the manners \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 51   Filed 06/20/19   Page 28 of 29\ndescribed by Plaintiffs. Specifically, counsel represented that “generally” ICE does not arrest \ncivil litigants, witnesses, or victims at courthouses. If this is the case, then to enjoin the \napplicability of the Courthouse Civil Arrest Directive as to civil arrests of courthouse attendees \nother than criminal defendants will cause no significant harm to the government. Plaintiffs, in \ncomparison, and the public in general will suffer harm each day that witnesses and victims refuse \nto participate in proceedings, as detailed above. \nPlaintiffs also contend that without an injunction, state criminal defendants who are \narrested by ICE coming or leaving the courthouse will be prevented from attending proceedings \nagainst them, impairing the DAs ability to prosecute cases and increasing CPCS’s costs in \nrepresenting criminal defendants. According to Defendants’ counsel, ICE’s general policy is not \nto arrest criminal defendants until the conclusion of the hearing that they are attending in state \ncourt. Counsel acknowledged, however, that ICE would make courthouse arrests before the \ntargeted individuals leave the courthouse. They contend that ICE’s inability “to arrest fugitive \naliens at the one place at which it can reliably find them in Massachusetts” would harm both the \npublic and the federal government, and that arrestees, officers and the public would be safer if \narrests are conducted in courthouses where individuals are screened for weapons. Defs.’ Opp. at \n26 [34].  \nThe court credits Defendants’ safety concerns, as well as the public’s need to be \nprotected from dangerous criminal aliens. But Defendants’ attempt to justify civil courthouse \narrests on these grounds, and on the fact that Massachusetts courts do not recognize civil \ndetainers, and that Federal, state and local law enforcement activity concerning criminal matters \n“routinely” occurs in courthouses, ignores a critical distinction regarding the challenged arrests. \nPlaintiffs here seek only to enjoin civil, not criminal, arrests. Where ICE has an alternative route \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 51   Filed 06/20/19   Page 29 of 29\nregarding targeted and dangerous aliens, namely, to pursue a criminal, rather than a civil arrest, \nsee 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(4), the balance of harm and public interest support issuance of the \ninjunction against civil arrests.  \nV.  Conclusion \n \n  Having found that Plaintiffs have standing to bring this suit, and that they have \ndemonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of Count 1 of their Complaint [1], that they \nare likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of \nequities tips in Plaintiffs’ favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest, the court \nGRANTS Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction [5]. The court will issue a preliminary \ninjunction enjoining Defendants from implementing ICE Directive No. 11072.1, “Civil \nImmigration Actions Inside Courthouses,” dated January 10, 2018, in Massachusetts and from \ncivilly arresting parties, witnesses, and others attending Massachusetts courthouses on official \nbusiness while they are going to, attending, or leaving the courthouse. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nJune 20, 2019                /s/ Indira Talwani                  \n                  United States District Judge \n \n \n29 \n ",

The Joint Stipulation states that on \nJanuary 20, 2021, the Acting Secretary of the Department for \nHomeland Security (\"DHS\") issued a memorandum directing DHS \ncomponents-such as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \n(\"ICE\")-to conduct a review of policies and practices concerning \nimmigration enforcement.

The court GRANTS \nthe Joint Stipulation 107 insofar as it seeks to extend discovery by \n120 days and to vacate the upcoming hearing date. \nRather than continue the hearing date, however, the court DENIES \nthe Motion to Dismiss 65  without prejudice. After that \nmotion was fully briefed, the First Circuit granted Defendants' \ninterlocutory appeal of the preliminary injunction entered in this \nmatter. USCA Opinion 97 . In doing so, the First Circuit addressed \nsome of the issues raised in the Motion to Dismiss. In light of that \nOpinion, the requested continuance, and the potential changes to \n\"the contours of the issues in this case,\" updated briefing would be \nhelpful to the court if the action proceeds. Accordingly, no later \nthan May 10, 2021, the parties shall report on the status of the \ncase, and, if Plaintiffs are proceeding on the Complaint 1  as \nfiled, shall propose a briefing schedule for any renewed motion to \ndismiss. \nThe court notes further that the First Circuit reserved judgment as \nto whether a Massachusetts common-law privilege prohibits civil \ncourthouse arrests and, if so, whether the Directive interferes with \nMassachusetts' power to operate its judiciary.

This case presents a challenge brought by Massachusetts prosecutors, public \ndefenders, and civil litigants to the federal government’s appropriation of the Massachusetts state \ncourts to carry out federal civil immigration policy.  For the last two years, officers from U.S. \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) have patrolled Massachusetts state \ncourthouses—including courtrooms, hallways, clerk’s offices, parking lots and front steps—\nfollowing, arresting, and detaining those they believe violated federal civil, not criminal, law.  In \nthe face of widespread opposition to this practice, ICE has not only refused to stop it, but has \nissued a formal Directive authorizing such civil courthouse arrests.  ICE’s Directive, and its \nwidespread practice of conducting civil arrests in state courthouses, are unprecedented in \nAmerican history.  Indeed, the U.S. Supreme Court and the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial \nCourt have long recognized a privilege against civil arrests for those attending court on official \nbusiness—a privilege that traces its roots back to English common law, and rests on the \ncommon-sense principle that the judicial system cannot function if parties and witnesses fear that \ntheir appearance in court will be used as a trap.    \n2.  ICE’s decision to flout the long-standing common-law privilege against civil \ncourthouse arrests and to commandeer the state courts for federal civil immigration purposes has \nled to effects on Plaintiffs, the Massachusetts justice system, and the public at large that are as \ndramatic as they are predictable.  Entire communities now view the Massachusetts courts as \nplaces where they cannot go, for any reason, greatly impeding access to justice and undermining \nthe administration of justice in these communities.  Criminal defendants refuse to appear, \ndefaulting rather than risk civil arrest, detention, and removal by ICE.  Witnesses do not appear \nfor fear of arrest and deportation, undermining prosecutions, depriving criminal defendants of \ntheir right to present a defense, and interfering with the operation of civil litigation.  And civil \n  2 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 3 of 48\nlitigants seeking relief such as restraining orders against violent partners, unpaid wages from an \nunscrupulous employer, or remedies from landlords providing illegal housing are forced to \ntolerate domestic violence, illegal working conditions, and unsafe living conditions to avoid ICE \ncivil arrest.   \n3.  Plaintiffs represent a range of actors in the state court system—prosecutors, \ndefense attorneys, and civil litigants—all of whom have directly felt the impact of ICE’s policy \nof civilly arresting parties, witnesses, and others attending court on official business.  Without \nany ability to ensure that Massachusetts residents can appear in court without ICE interference, \nPlaintiffs Marian Ryan and Rachael Rollins, the District Attorneys for Middlesex County and \nSuffolk County (the “District Attorneys”), are unable to prosecute many crimes because the \nvictims, key witnesses, or even the defendants do not appear.  Plaintiff Committee for Public \nCounsel Services, which is responsible for indigent criminal defense in the Commonwealth, \ncannot present meaningful defenses because its clients or defense witnesses do not appear.  And \nPlaintiff Chelsea Collaborative is a membership organization with noncitizen members who have \nbeen unable to access the courts to enforce their state-law rights for fear of ICE arrest.  This has \nnot only led to harm to Chelsea Collaborative’s members, but has forced Chelsea Collaborative \nto spend significant resources assisting its members, including by instituting its own extra-\njudicial mediation program in an attempt to resolve disputes between Massachusetts residents \nwho no longer feel safe appearing in Massachusetts state courts. \n4.  ICE’s civil-courthouse-arrest policy not only undermines the administration of \njustice in Massachusetts, it is also illegal for at least three reasons.   \n5.  First, Congress never authorized ICE to conduct civil courthouse arrests because \nit never abrogated the longstanding and well-settled common-law privilege against such arrests.  \n  3 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 4 of 48\nThe Supreme Court has recognized that the common-law privilege against civil courthouse \narrests is “well settled.”  Stewart v. Ramsay, 242 U.S. 128, 129 (1916).  When Congress acts in \nan area governed by “long-established and familiar” common-law principles, Congress is \npresumed to retain those principles.  United States v. Texas, 507 U.S. 529, 534 (1993).  Here, \nwhere Congress granted the federal government a general civil-arrest power to enforce civil \nimmigration laws, Congress retained traditional common-law limitations on that arrest power—\nincluding that such arrests cannot be made against parties and witnesses attending court on \nofficial business.  Indeed, finding that Congress abrogated the common-law privilege would be \nparticularly inappropriate given the significant constitutional concerns relating to separation of \npowers and court access raised by federal appropriation of state courts for civil arrests.  Because \nthe INA does not grant the federal government the authority to conduct civil courthouse arrests \nin violation of the common-law privilege, ICE’s Directive authorizing such arrests, and its \ncorresponding policy of conducting such arrests, exceed ICE’s statutory authority, and must be \nset aside under the Administrative Procedure Act.  See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).   \n6.  Second, even if ICE’s Directive were authorized by statute, the Directive and the \ncorresponding practice of civilly arresting parties, witnesses, and others attending Massachusetts \nstate courts on official business exceed the powers granted to the federal government, and hence \nviolate the Tenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.  “[T]he Federal Government may not \ncompel the States to implement, by legislation or executive action, federal regulatory programs.”  \nPrintz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 925 (1997).  Yet that is precisely what ICE’s civil \ncourthouse arrest program does.  ICE has coopted the state’s justice system, using it as a tool for \ntrapping those required to attend state court.  ICE’s civil-courthouse-arrest policy triggers all of \nthe concerns that the Supreme Court recently identified as signaling a Tenth Amendment \n  4 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 5 of 48\nviolation, including the shifting the political responsibility for and costs of immigration \nenforcement to the states.  See Murphy v. Nat’l Collegiate Athletic Ass’n, 138 S. Ct. 1461, 1477 \n(2018).  \n7.  Third, ICE’s policy violates the Constitutional right of access to the courts, which \nprohibits “systemic official action [that] frustrates a plaintiff or plaintiff class in preparing and \nfiling suits.”  Christopher v. Harbury, 536 U.S. 403, 413, 415 & n.12 (2002).  Conditioning \nlitigants’ ability to access the courts on making themselves available for civil arrest creates \nprecisely such impermissible frustration.  Indeed, common-law courts created the privilege \nagainst civil courthouse arrest in recognition of the intolerable chilling effect of such arrests, \nexplaining that the fear of arrest would “prevent [parties and witnesses’] approach,” obstructing \n“the administration of justice.”  Halsey v. Stewart, 4 N.J.L. 366, 368 (N.J. 1817).  Because of \nICE’s policy, Chelsea Collaborative’s members have been unable to use the courts to obtain \nrelief from domestic violence or other civil wrongs like illegal living and working conditions.  In \nresponse, Chelsea Collaborative has been forced to establish its own extra-judicial mediation \nprogram—which handles three or four mediations per week—to attempt to resolve disputes \nbetween Massachusetts residents who are no longer willing to appear in Massachusetts court for \nfear of civil ICE arrest. \n8.  For these reasons, and as set forth below, Plaintiffs ask this Court to declare that \nICE’s Directive authorizing the civil arrest of parties, victims, witnesses, and others attending \ncourt on official business, and ICE’s policy of conducting such arrests, are unlawful, and to \nenjoin ICE from such activity. \n  5 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 6 of 48\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE  \n9.  The Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1346.  This Court has \nfurther remedial authority under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 et \nseq.  The United States has waived its sovereign immunity pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 702. \n10.  Venue properly lies within the District of Massachusetts because this is an action \nagainst an officer, employee, and/or agency of the United States, all Plaintiffs reside in this \njudicial district, and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to this action have \noccurred in this judicial district.  See 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1). \nPARTIES \n11.  Plaintiff Marian Ryan is the Middlesex County District Attorney, and brings this \nsuit in her official capacity.

The combined population of Suffolk and Middlesex Counties is nearly 2.5 million \npeople—approximately one-third of the Commonwealth’s population.   \n  6 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 7 of 48\n14.  Plaintiff Committee for Public Counsel Services (“CPCS”) is the public defender \nagency for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  CPCS is headquartered at 44 Bromfield Street, \nBoston, Massachusetts, 02108, and is overseen by a fifteen-member body appointed by the heads \nof the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of Massachusetts.  CPCS is responsible for the \nprovision of legal representation, by both staff attorneys and court-appointed private attorneys, of \nall indigent persons in civil, criminal, and administrative cases in Massachusetts in which there is \na right to appointed counsel. \n15.  As the key players on the prosecution and defense sides of the criminal justice \nsystem, the District Attorneys and CPCS have joined together to challenge what they collectively \nagree to be a profound threat to the Massachusetts criminal justice system.  Both prosecutors and \ndefense attorneys depend on witnesses to carry out investigations, prosecutions, and criminal \ndefense.  ICE’s civil-courthouse-arrest policy is undermining the work of both prosecutors and \ndefense attorneys by deterring many victims and witnesses from appearing in court, forcing the \nDistrict Attorneys to abandon otherwise promising prosecutions.  ICE’s policy also makes it \nmore difficult to obtain defendants’ appearance in court—both because defendants arrested, \ndetained and subject to removal proceedings prior to resolution of their criminal cases may not \nbe able to appear in court, and because the risk of ICE arrest leads some criminal defendants to \ndefault—which makes both prosecution and defense impossible.  On information and belief, this \ncase represents the first time that the District Attorneys and CPCS have joined as plaintiffs to \nchallenge such a threat to the Massachusetts justice system.  \n16.  Plaintiff Chelsea Collaborative, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization located \nat 318 Broadway, Chelsea, Massachusetts, 02150.  The Collaborative, originally founded in 1988 \nas the Chelsea Human Services Collaborative, is an organization dedicated to the needs of the \n  7 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 8 of 48\ncommunity of Chelsea.  The mission of the Collaborative is to enhance the social, \nenvironmental, and economic health of the community and its people.  The Collaborative \nprovides numerous services to the immigrant community in Chelsea, including citizenship \nclasses, summer employment for teenagers, landlord-tenant education, voter mobilizations, and \nassistance in accessing the judicial system. \n17.  Defendant U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is a federal agency \ncharged with enforcement of federal immigration laws, including execution of ICE Directive No. \n11072.1 entitled “Civil Immigration Actions Inside Courthouses” (the “Directive”), dated \nJanuary 10, 2018.   \n18.  Defendant Matthew T. Albence is the Deputy Director and Senior Official \nPerforming the Duties of the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  On \ninformation and belief, Defendant Albence is responsible for executing the Directive.  Deputy \nDirector Albence is sued in his official capacity. \n19.  Defendant Todd M. Lyons is the Acting Boston Field Office Director of U.S. \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement, Enforcement and Removal Operations.  He is charged \nwith ICE enforcement in the Boston area.  Acting Field Office Director Lyons is sued in his \nofficial capacity. \n20.  Defendant the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) is a cabinet department \nof the U.S. federal government, which oversees Defendant U.S. Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement.  \n21.  Defendant Kevin McAleenan is the Acting Secretary of the Defendant DHS.  \nActing Secretary McAleenan is responsible for executing relevant provisions of the Executive \nOrder 13,768, entitled “Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States” (the “EO \n  8 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 9 of 48\n13,768” or “Executive Order”), issued on January 25, 2017.  Acting Secretary McAleenan is \nsued in his official capacity. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n22.  In January 2017, at the direction of President Trump, then-DHS Secretary John \nKelly, and then-ICE Deputy Director Thomas Homan, ICE began a nationwide campaign \nspecifically targeting state courthouses as sites for civil immigration enforcement.  The practice \nsent a shockwave of fear and anxiety through immigrant communities in Massachusetts and \nacross the country.  This pervasive fear has paralyzed the effective administration of justice in \ndramatic yet predictable ways.  So predictable in fact that centuries of English and American \njurisprudence have guarded against such a chilling effect by affording individuals with a \ncommon-law privilege precluding such civil courthouse arrests.  ICE’s Directive authorizing \ncivil courthouse arrests, and its policy of conducting them, violate the long-standing common-\nlaw protection against civil arrests in and around courthouses, exceed ICE’s statutory authority \nunder the INA, and violate the Constitution. \n  There is a “well settled” common-law privilege against civil arrests of parties, \nwitnesses, and others attending court on official business. \n23.  In England, and in the early years of this country, civil arrest, or civil capias, was \na common means for initiating civil proceedings.  See Nathan Levy, Jr., Mesne Process in \nPersonal Actions at Common Law and the Power Doctrine, 78 Yale L.J. 52, 61-70 (1968).  The \npossibility that such civil arrests could take place in court, however, posed a significant problem \nfor the judicial system:  If a party or witness’s appearance in one case could be used as a trap for \na civil arrest in another case, many parties and witnesses would not attend court.  To avoid this \nproblem, courts both in England and the United States—including the U.S. Supreme Court, this \nCourt, and the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court—all recognized and strictly enforced an \n  9 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 10 of 48\n“inflexib[le]” privilege, and an “absolute protection,” against the civil arrest of parties or \nwitnesses attending court.  E.g., Page Co. v. MacDonald, 261 U.S. 446, 448 (1923); Larned v. \nGriffin, 12 F. 590, 594 (D. Mass. 1882); Valley Bank & Trust Co. v. Marrewa, 354 Mass. 403, \n406-07 (1968).  As the Supreme Court explained, “the due administration of justice requires that \na court shall not permit interference with the progress of a case pending before it, by the service \nof process in other suits, which would prevent, or the fear of which might tend to discourage, the \nvoluntary attendance of those whose presence is necessary or convenient to the judicial \nadministration in the pending litigation.”  Lamb v. Schmitt, 285 U.S. 222, 225 (1932).   \n24.  The common-law privilege against civil arrest while attending court on official \nbusiness is longstanding, tracing its origins back at least to English courts in the eighteenth \ncentury.  Blackstone’s Commentaries on the Laws of England explained the common-law rule \nthat “[s]uitors, witnesses, and other persons, necessarily attending any courts of record upon \nbusiness, are not to be arrested during their actual attendance, which includes their necessary \ncoming and returning.”  3 William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 289 \n(1769); see also 6 Matthew Bacon, A New Abridgment of the Law 530 (London, A. Strahan, 7th \ned. 1832) (“[A]ll [] persons whatsoever, are freed from arrests so long as they are in view of any \nof the courts at Westminster, or if near the courts, though out of view, lest any disturbance may \nbe occasioned to the courts or any violence used.”).  This principle was repeatedly endorsed by \nthe English courts, which held that, “for the purpose of justice,” and “to encourage witnesses to \ncome forward voluntarily,” they are privileged from arrest “in coming, in staying, and in \nreturning” from court.  The King v. Holy Trinity in Wareham, 99 Eng. Rep. 531 (1782); see also \nMeekins v. Smith, 126 Eng. Rep. 363 (1791) (“[A]ll persons who had relation to a suit which \ncalled for their attendance, whether they were compelled to attend by process or not, (in which \n  10 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 11 of 48\nnumber bail were included,) were intitled to privilege from arrest eundo et redeundo [i.e., coming \nand returning][.]”); Spence v. Stuart, 102 Eng. Rep. 530 (1802); Ex Parte Byne, 35 Eng. Rep. \n123 (1813).   \n25.  The U.S. Supreme Court has adopted this privilege and held that it bars service of \nany other civil process while attending court.  For instance, in Stewart v. Ramsay, 242 U.S. 128 \n(1916), the Court described the privilege as “well settled,” explaining that a litigant “should be \npermitted to approach [the courts], not only without subjecting himself to evil, but even free \nfrom the fear of molestation or hindrance.  He should also be enabled to procure, without \ndifficulty, the attendance of all such persons as are necessary to manifest his rights.”  Id. at 129.  \nThe Court described it as particularly firmly established that there was an “exemption from \narrest,” or “capias,” and held that this exemption applied to any civil process to protect the \n“necessities of the judicial administration, which would be often embarrassed, and sometimes \ninterrupted, if the suitor might be vexed with process while attending upon the court for the \nprotection of his rights, or the witness while attending to testify.”  Id. at 130.  The Court has \nemphasized the “necessity of [the rule’s] inflexibility” in order to serve its purpose of protecting \nlitigants and witnesses in appearing in court.  Page Co., 261 U.S. at 448; see also Long v. Ansell, \n293 U.S. 76, 83 (1934) (Brandeis, J.) (describing “the common-law rule that witnesses, suitors, \nand their attorneys, while in attendance in connection with the conduct of one suit, are immune \nfrom service in another”); Lamb, 285 U.S. at 225. \n26.  The District of Massachusetts has also vigorously enforced this privilege.  As this \nCourt has explained, “[i]t has long been settled that parties and witnesses attending in good faith \nany legal tribunal . . . are privileged from arrest on civil process during their attendance, and for a \nreasonable time in going and returning.”  Larned, 12 F. at 590.  This is an “absolute protection.”  \n  11 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 12 of 48\nId. at 594.  This Court therefore held that the civil arrest of the defendant while he was attending \nan Illinois state court proceeding was impermissible.  See id. at 590.  \n27.  The privilege against civil courthouse arrests is also firmly entrenched in \nMassachusetts common law.  As the Supreme Judicial Court has explained, “[p]arties and \nwitnesses, attending in good faith any legal tribunal, whether a court of record or not, having \npower to pass upon the rights of the persons attending, are privileged from arrest on civil process \nduring their attendance, and for a reasonable time in going and returning, whether they are \nresidents of this state or come from abroad, whether they attend on summons or voluntarily.”  \nValley Bank, 354 Mass. at 406-07 (quoting In re Thompson, 122 Mass. 428, 429 (1877)); see \nalso M’Neil’s Case, 3 Mass. 288 (1807); Diamond v. Earle, 217 Mass. 499, 500 (1914).  Indeed, \njust this past year, Justice Cypher recognized, in a Single Justice opinion, that the “privilege \nagainst civil arrest” in attending court is “well settled” in the Commonwealth.  Matter of C. Doe, \nSJ-2018-119 at *10 (Mass. Sept. 18, 2018).   \n28.  The consistent theme throughout the cases discussing this common-law privilege \nis that strict and absolute enforcement of the privilege is necessary to allow courts to serve their \npurpose of providing a forum where parties and witnesses can freely attend to testify and assert \ntheir rights.  In a decision the Supreme Court recognized as a “leading authority” on the \nprivilege, Stewart, 242 U.S. at 129, the New Jersey Supreme Court explained that “[c]ourts of \njustice ought, everywhere, to be open, accessible, free from interruption, and to cast a perfect \nprotection around every man who necessarily approaches them.”  Halsey, 4 N.J.L. at 367.  The \n“fear that . . . a capias might be served upon [parties and witnesses]” would “prevent [their] \napproach,” obstructing “this great object in the administration of justice.”  Id. at 368.  In sum: \nThis privilege of parties and witnesses is alike the privilege of the \ncourt and the citizen.  It protects the court from interruption and \n  12 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 13 of 48\ndelay.  It takes away a strong inducement to disobey its process, \nand enables the citizen to prosecute his rights without molestation, \nand procure the attendance of such as are necessary for their \ndefence and support. \nId. at 368-69. \n29.  The same sentiment has been consistently expressed across all courts discussing \nthe privilege.  As the Supreme Court explained in Stewart v. Ramsay, the privilege “is founded in \nthe necessities of the judicial administration, which would be often embarrassed, and sometimes \ninterrupted, if the suitor might be vexed with process while attending upon the court for the \nprotection of his rights, or the witness while attending to testify.”  242 U.S. at 130.  This Court \nand the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court have also recognized that the privilege is \n“necessary to the due administration of justice,” Larned, 12 F. at 594, and “is a prerogative \nexerted by the sovereign power through the courts for the furtherance of the ends of justice,” \nValley Bank, 354 Mass. at 405.  “[T]he reason upon which [the privilege] rests is that justice \nrequires the attendance of witnesses cognizant of material facts, and hence that no unreasonable \nobstacles ought to be thrown in the way of their freely coming into court to give oral testimony.”  \nDiamond v. Earle, 217 Mass. 499, 501 (1914).  Thus, a litigant “in every claim of right which he \nexhibits, and every defense which he is obliged to make, should be permitted to approach [the \ncourts], not only without subjecting himself to evil, but even free from the fear of molestation or \nhindrance.  He should also be enabled to procure, without difficulty, the attendance of all such \npersons as are necessary to manifest his rights.”  Stewart, 242 U.S. at 129 (quoting Halsey, 4 \nN.J.L. at 367-68).   \n30.  Because of the privilege’s importance, courts have recognized numerous different \nways in which courts can enforce the privilege, including ordering the person arrested \nimmediately discharged and holding the arresting officers in contempt for violating the privilege.  \n  13 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 14 of 48\nSee Arding v. Flower, 8 T.R. 533 (1800); Parker v. Marco, 136 N.Y. 585 (1893) (“[A wrongfully \ndetained individual] may move in the court whose privilege has been violated to punish the party \nin that court who has been guilty of such violation, or he may move in the court out of which the \nprocess has been improperly issued to vacate it, and the motion will be granted.”). \n31.  Similarly, courts have recognized that because the privilege inherently involves \ntwo different proceedings, often the court that enforces the privilege is different than the court \nwith jurisdiction over the proceeding in which the improper arrest would or could take place.  \nThus, the English courts held that a claim for discharge out of custody can be made to the court \nout of which “the process was issued,” because that court has “a right to see that it is not \nimproperly enforced.”  Selby v. Hills, 131 Eng. Rep. 364, 365 (1832).  The U.S. Supreme Court \nreached the same conclusion in Page Co. v. MacDonald, 261 U.S. at 447-48.  In that case, a \nparty was served in a federal case filed in this Court while attending court for a Massachusetts \nstate court case.  The served party asked the federal court to hold the service improper.  The \nplaintiff argued that a party in state court could not claim immunity from service “from the \njudicial process of a different sovereignty,” but the Supreme Court disagreed.  As the Court \nexplained, “the courts, federal and state, have equal interests in [the necessities of the judicial \nadministration],” and they “are both instruments of judicial administration within the same \nterritory, available to suitors, fully available, neither they nor their witnesses subject to be \nembarrassed or vexed while attending, the one for the protection of his rights; the others while \nattending to testify.”  Id. at 448.  The Court therefore enforced the privilege against civil arrest \nand service of process on behalf of the state court.   \n32.  Federal district courts, including this Court, thus routinely held that federal and \nstate courts should enforce the privilege on each other’s behalf.  In Larned, for instance, this \n  14 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 15 of 48\nCourt upheld an assertion of the privilege against an arrest carried out in an Illinois state court \nproceeding.  12 F. at 590.  And in Bridges v. Sheldon, 7 F. 17, 45 (D. Vt. 1880), the court held \nthat it can enforce the privilege to invalidate service of state civil process on those attending \nfederal court because the privilege is a “protection which all courts furnish to litigants before \nthem, without regard to the subject of that litigation,” and violations of the privilege are “a \ncontempt, which the court should punish.”   \n  Congress grants ICE a general civil arrest power, which ICE interprets to authorize \ncivil courthouse arrests.  \n  Congress grants ICE generic civil-arrest authority, without any suggestion \nthat it intended to abrogate the common-law limits that apply to civil arrests. \n33.  The provisions authorizing civil immigration arrests originate in the Immigration \nand Nationality Act of 1952, Pub. L. 82-414, 66 Stat. 163.  That statute includes two provisions \nauthorizing civil immigration arrests.  Section 242(a) of that statute states that, “[p]ending a \ndetermination of deportability in the case of any alien as provided in subsection (b) of this \nsection, such alien may, upon warrant of the Attorney General, be arrested and taken into \ncustody.”  Section 287(a)(2) of that statute authorizes an immigration officer to carry out a \nwarrantless civil arrest “if he has reason to believe that the alien so arrested is in the United \nStates in violation of any such law or regulation and is likely to escape before a warrant can be \nobtained for his arrest.”   \n34.  The language Congress enacted in 1952 remains largely unchanged today.  \nSpecifically, 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a) states:  “On a warrant issued by the Attorney General, an alien \nmay be arrested and detained pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from the \nUnited States.”  And 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(2) authorizes an immigration officer to perform a civil \nimmigration arrest “if he has reason to believe that the alien so arrested is in the United States in \n  15 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 16 of 48\nviolation of any [immigration] law or regulation and is likely to escape before a warrant can be \nobtained for his arrest.”   \n35.  The statute thus gives the government the same type of civil-arrest authority that \nhad historically been used to institute civil proceedings.  See INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. \n1032, 1038 (1984) (“A deportation proceeding is a purely civil action to determine eligibility to \nremain in this country”).  The statute today, as in 1952, gives no indication that the authority \nCongress granted differs in any way from the civil-arrest authority that existed at common law— \nincluding the limitation privileging those attending court on official business from civil \ncourthouse arrest.   \n  ICE unilaterally decides to exercise its civil-arrest authority in state \ncourthouses. \n36.  The federal government’s exercise of its civil-arrest powers changed dramatically \nafter President Trump assumed office in 2017—sixty-five years after Congress first authorized \ncivil immigration arrests.  Shortly after taking office, President Trump issued Executive Order \n13,768, entitled “Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States” (“EO 13,768”).  In \nthat Order, President Trump abandoned past deportation prioritization programs embraced by \nboth the Bush and Obama Administrations, calling for the deportation of anyone potentially \nremovable from the United States—likely more than 10 million people.  As EO 13,768 \nrecognized, administering this massive increase in immigration enforcement would require a \ncorrespondingly massive increase in federal resources, including a near-tripling of ICE’s \ncapacity.    \n37.  One way ICE has attempted to reduce the federal resources necessary to \nimplement this federal policy is to coopt the state court system by using parties’ appearances in \nstate courts as a trap for purposes of federal immigration enforcement.  Early in the Trump \n  16 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 17 of 48\nadministration, ICE officials began conducting courthouse surveillance and arrest raids at state \ncourthouses.  Exhibit A.  The practice began almost immediately after President Trump’s \ninauguration and escalated quickly.  Courthouse arrest and surveillance operations have \ncontinued to expand in geographic scope and severity.   \n38.  ICE officials have repeatedly acknowledged and defended the practice of civil \ncourthouse arrests.  On March 29, 2017, then-Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and then-\nAttorney General Jefferson Sessions acknowledged the civil courthouse arrest practice and stated \nadamantly that ICE would continue the practice.  See Exhibit B at 2.  Further, they have admitted \nthat using state courthouses to trap those suspected of civil immigration violations is a way of \nusing the state’s resources for federal benefit.  Sessions and Kelly emphasized the benefit to ICE \nof this forced cooperation by state officers, noting that “[b]ecause courthouse visitors are \ntypically screened upon entry to search for weapons and other contraband, the safety risks for the \narresting [ICE] officers and persons being arrested are substantially decreased.”  Exhibit B at 2. \n39.  DHS and ICE have also made clear that anyone is subject to an ICE civil arrest \nwhile attending court, including victims.  For instance, in April 2017, a DHS spokesman stated:   \nJust because they’re a victim in a certain case does not mean \nthere’s not something in their background that could cause them to \nbe a removable alien[.] Just because they’re a witness doesn’t \nmean they might not pose a security threat for other reasons. \nSimilarly, on August 30, 2017, the Boston Field Officer Director for ICE told immigration \nadvocates they should not assure restraining order applicants with no prior criminal record that \nICE would not arrest them if they went to the courthouse to seek protection.  Indeed, ICE has \narrested at least one woman while appearing in court to obtain a protective order from an abusive \npartner.  In public remarks throughout 2017, DHS and other Trump Administration officials \ncontinued to clarify their intent to arrest victims and witnesses, including an ICE spokeswoman’s \n  17 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 18 of 48\nstatement: “If [a courthouse is] the only place we can find them, why wouldn’t we? . . . We will \ncontinue to make those arrests.”   \n40.  Consistent with these official statements and conduct, ICE has refused, as a more \nformal matter, to rule out the possibility of conducting enforcement against anyone, anywhere in \ncourt.  In a “frequently asked questions” document, ICE responded to the question of whether \nthere is “any place in a courthouse where enforcement will not occur” by stating, in effect, “no”: \nICE officers and agents will generally avoid enforcement actions \nin courthouses, or areas within courthouses, that are dedicated to \nnon-criminal (e.g., family court, small claims court) proceedings.  \nIn those instances in which an enforcement action in such locations \nis operationally necessary, the approval of the respective Field \nOffice Director (FOD), Special Agent in Charge (SAC), or his or \nher designee is required. \nExhibit C at 3 (emphases added).  ICE provided no information concerning when it would deem \nsuch enforcement “operationally necessary,” maintaining full discretion to civilly arrest anyone \nin any courthouse.   \n  ICE formalizes its courthouse-arrest policy in Directive No. 11072.1. \n41.  On January 10, 2018, ICE formalized its courthouse arrest policy in Directive No. \n11072.1, entitled “Civil Immigration Actions Inside Courthouses” (the “Directive”; attached as \nExhibit D).  This Directive “sets forth [ICE’s] policy regarding civil immigration enforcement \ninside federal, state, and local courthouses.” \n42.  While ostensibly setting some limitations to ICE enforcement at courthouses, the \nDirective ultimately vests ICE with the unbridled discretion to make civil arrests in virtually any \ncourthouse location when ICE deems it “necessary,” providing noncitizens with no assurance \nthat they will be safe from arrest at any courthouse or under any specific circumstances.  Exhibit \nD at 2. \n  18 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 19 of 48\n43.  The Directive states that ICE’s courthouse arrests will “include” actions against \n“specific, target aliens with criminal convictions, gang members, national security or public \nsafety threats, aliens who have been ordered removed from the United States but have failed to \ndepart, and aliens who have re-entered the country illegally after being removed.”  But it \npointedly does not limit its arrests to these “target aliens.”  Exhibit D at 1. \n44.  Similarly, the Directive provides that “[a]liens encountered during a civil \nimmigration enforcement action inside a courthouse” who are not “targeted alien[s] . . . will not \nbe subject to . . . enforcement action, absent special circumstances.”  The Directive provides no \ninformation concerning what ICE considers “special circumstances,” but simply states that “ICE \nofficers and agents will make enforcement determinations on a case-by-case basis in accordance \nwith federal law and consistent with U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) policy.” \nExhibit D at 1. \n45.  The Directive does not state what this DHS policy is, but instead cross-references \ntwo other internal DHS memoranda.  Those two memoranda, however, say nothing about \ncourthouse arrests.  Exhibits E and F.  Indeed, one of the memoranda simply reiterates EO \n13,768, stating that DHS “no longer will exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from \npotential enforcement.”  Exhibit F at 2.  This memorandum suggests, if anything, that anyone \npotentially removable would be a fair target of a courthouse arrest.    \n46.  Ultimately, the Directive simply formalizes the Trump Administration’s \nconsistent policy that ICE has complete discretion to use federal and state courthouses as a trap \nto arrest anyone suspected of a civil immigration violation—including criminal defendants, \nvictims, witnesses, and parties to civil proceedings.  \n  19 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 20 of 48\n  ICE officers are routinely present in Massachusetts state courthouses, making \nmultiple arrests per week, causing significant disturbances, and sending a clear \nsignal that appearing in Massachusetts courts entails risking civil ICE arrest. \n47.  ICE does not disclose the frequency of, or details concerning, its civil courthouse \narrests in Massachusetts.  Nevertheless, Plaintiffs have attempted, through their own and others’ \nobservations of ICE in Massachusetts courts, and through reviewing the limited data that is \navailable from the Massachusetts courts, to capture the extent of ICE’s presence in \nMassachusetts courts.  It is readily apparent that ICE officers are regularly present in \nMassachusetts state courts such that appearing in a Massachusetts state court requires exposing \noneself to the possibility of civil ICE arrest.   \n48.  The presence of ICE officers in Massachusetts state courts is sufficiently routine \nthat those regularly practicing in state courts—including Assistant District Attorneys and public \ndefenders—recognize the ICE officers even though they are generally in plain clothes, not in \nuniform. \n49.  On information and belief, based on Plaintiffs’ own observations and incident \nreports filed with the Massachusetts state trial courts, ICE conducts a civil arrest against \nsomeone attending a Massachusetts state court on official business approximately two or three \ntimes a week.  A significant percentage of these arrests appear to take place in Middlesex and \nSuffolk Counties.  This includes arrests in and around the courthouse, including the parking lot \nand the front steps.  It does not include arrests of those who are brought to court while in state \ncriminal custody.  It also does not include incidents in which ICE attempts, but fails, to make an \narrest.  Many of the most disruptive incidents involve such attempted arrests.  \n50.  Arrests of those brought into court while in state criminal custody do not raise the \nsame concerns as arrests of those who come to court under their own power.  Plaintiffs here are \nnot challenging ICE’s authority to arrest those brought into court while in state criminal custody.   \n  20 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 21 of 48\n51.  On information and belief, the following are characteristics of ICE’s civil \ncourthouse arrests: \na.  ICE agents are in plain clothes, but are readily identifiable by those who \nfrequent the courts. \nb.  ICE agents are, on information and belief, generally, if not always, armed. \nc.  Though ICE officers often appear to have some target in mind when they \narrive in court, they sometimes question and arrest others in court who the \nICE officers believe may have committed civil immigration infractions.  This \ncan include family members who are accompanying someone ICE has \ntargeted for arrest.  ICE often reviews court dockets upon arriving in court, \nand sometimes arrests or attempts to arrest others who happen to appear in \ncourt that day, and who ICE believes may have committed a civil immigration \ninfraction. \nd.  ICE’s arrests and attempted arrests are disruptive and may even involve \nviolence.  There have been reports of slamming family members against \nwalls, dragging individuals from cars, and pulling guns on people while \nleaving court.  ICE has handcuffed family members who turn out to be \nlawfully present in the United States.  In one such instance in Massachusetts, \nICE was unable to remove the handcuffs because it had lost the keys, and was \nforced to obtain a handsaw to saw the handcuffs off in a courthouse \nconference room.  These incidents often occur in public areas of the court, \nincluding the court lobby.  Given the physical nature of some of these \nincidents, ICE arrests can require intervention of state court staff. \n  21 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 22 of 48\ne.  ICE agents, who are typically in plain clothes, frequently fail to show their \nbadges or show any documentation while making arrests, which has at times \nled members of the public to believe that ICE agents are kidnapping their \ntargets.   \nf.  ICE arrests often interfere with ongoing state court proceedings.  When \ncriminal defendants are arrested and detained by ICE while their criminal \ncases are still pending, the defendants often are unable to return to state court \nto resolve their criminal cases. \n52.  The following paragraphs provide several examples that demonstrate the nature of \nICE’s presence in the Massachusetts court system.  These examples are far from exhaustive, but \nshow the type of disruption often caused by ICE’s presence in the Massachusetts courts. \n53.  March 2018 seizure and interrogation at Lawrence Juvenile Court.  A \njuvenile defendant was meeting with counsel in the library of the courthouse when five ICE \nofficers barged into the room and surrounded the defendant.  ICE demanded that the juvenile put \nhis hands up and they began to question him.  His counsel was able to successfully stop the \ninterrogation, and prevent the arrest of his client, but the officers proceeded to follow the \njuvenile and his counsel throughout the courthouse. \n54.  April 2018 harassment of court interpreter in Lynn District Court.  An ICE \nOfficer was seen verbally harassing a court interpreter regarding a communication she had \ninterpreted between a defendant and counsel.  The officer’s threatening tone prompted onlookers \nto intervene to force the officer to leave the interpreter alone. \n  22 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 23 of 48\n55.  June 27, 2018 arrest at Marlboro District Court.  A criminal defendant was \ntaken into custody just outside of the courtroom door, in a public area, by plain-clothes ICE \nagents.  ICE had to tell the target that they were not kidnapping him.   \n56.  July 2018 interrogation at Boston Municipal Court.  While a criminal \ndefendant was retrieving documents from the clerk’s office, an ICE officer present in the clerk’s \noffice approached the defendant, demanded identification and forced him into a private room in \nthe courthouse reserved for police and prosecutors for further questioning. \n57.  December 2018 attempted arrest at Roxbury District Court.  A criminal \ndefendant was attending court for a pretrial hearing.  As the defendant, his girlfriend, and her \nyoung child were leaving the courthouse, they were approached by four ICE officers in plain \nclothes who asked for identification.  The defendant went back into the courthouse to find his \nattorney.  From that point on, the ICE officers followed the defendant and his attorney as he \nawaited a second hearing, telling him that they were going to arrest him as soon as his hearing \nwas over and showing him handcuffs.  Six ICE officers sat in the gallery directly behind the \ndefendant whispering to him that they were going to get him as soon as the hearing ended.  \nDuring the second hearing, the defendant fainted from the stress of the ICE officers’ constant \nthreats.  Ultimately, the court ordered bail and the defendant was placed in criminal custody.  \nWhen asked for an administrative warrant or an immigration detainer, ICE could not produce \nany document.  The defendant subsequently posted bail and was released.  At the defendant’s \nnext hearing, his case was almost certainly going to be dismissed because the witness against \nhim had recanted and the Commonwealth was unable to prove the charges against him.  But the \ndefendant did not appear at that hearing and could not be contacted by his defense attorney.  The \ncourt thus entered a criminal default against him.   \n  23 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 24 of 48\n58.  February 2019 arrest in Somerville District Court.  A criminal defendant had \nattended a pretrial conference.  When leaving the courtroom, two ICE agents tackled him in the \npublic lobby of the courthouse, bringing him to the ground.  Onlookers believed it was a civilian \nfist fight (unrelated to law enforcement) because the officers were in plain clothes with no visible \nlaw enforcement identification and they had chased a man through the courthouse and tackled \nhim.  The disruption was sufficiently violent that state court officers were required to intervene. \n59.  January 2019 attempted arrest in Middlesex Superior Court.  A criminal \ndefendant and his uncle were waiting for a hearing to begin, seated in a conference room open to \nthe public.  ICE officers entered the conference room and handcuffed both the defendant and his \nuncle.  The ICE officers then blocked access to the conference room, preventing the defendant’s \nattorney from entering.  The ICE officers ultimately realized that the defendant’s uncle was not \nremovable, but by that time they had lost the keys to the handcuffs.  The officers were ultimately \nforced to obtain a handsaw to saw the handcuffs off of the uncle.  \n60.  Notably, many of the individuals ICE has targeted for its civil courthouse arrests \nhave no criminal records and are charged with only minor misdemeanors.  However, because of \nICE arrests or the fear of such arrests, they are unable to defend against these charges.  For \ninstance, ICE arrested an individual who had lived lawfully in the United States for years on a \nnon-immigrant work visa.  This individual remained in the United States after his visa expired \nand was a popular youth athletic coach for many years.  Then, he was involved in a car accident; \nthe other driver fled, but this individual remained at the scene and called the police.  The police \ncharged him with operating under the influence.  ICE arrested this individual while he was \nleaving the courthouse after his first pre-trial conference; he was subsequently deported and \nnever able to defend himself against the criminal charge.  In another example, ICE arrested a \n  24 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 25 of 48\nlawful permanent resident entering court for a probation violation hearing.  Because he could not \nappear in court and missed his hearing, a default warrant was issued against him.  In another \nexample, ICE arrested a man outside of East Boston District Court before he could answer to \ncharges of unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle, prompting the issuance of a default against \nhim.  Defendants frequently miss criminal hearings, and even trials, because of ICE’s civil-\ncourthouse-arrest policy. \n61.  ICE has also used courthouse arrests to target those with a path towards legal \nresidence.  For instance, ICE arrested a juvenile defendant who had been approved for Special \nImmigrant Juvenile status and was waiting to apply for legal permanent residence.  On the day \nthe juvenile court dismissed his pending delinquency charges, finding him incompetent to stand \ntrial, ICE arrested him as he was walking out of the courthouse. \n62.  Given the publicity around these stories and others like them, and given the \nmyriad other incidents of ICE courthouse arrests that occur without disruption or violence but \nwhere news of the arrest travels throughout the local communities, ICE’s civil-courthouse-arrest \npolicy has sent a strong message that appearing in Massachusetts courts requires exposure to \ncivil ICE arrest.  As discussed below, this has had a dramatic impact on many noncitizens’ \nwillingness to appear in Massachusetts courts. \n  Because of ICE’s courthouse arrest policy, many noncitizen Massachusetts residents \nwill not attend Massachusetts state courts for fear of civil arrest and detention, \ncausing significant harm to Plaintiffs. \n63.  The impact of ICE’s civil-courthouse-arrest policy has made clear that the \nconcerns that underlie the privilege against civil arrest of those attending court on official \nbusiness are well founded.  Civil plaintiffs, criminal defendants, prosecutors, defense attorneys, \nand civil and criminal legal aid societies all suffer the negative effects of the chill on the \nimmigrant community’s willingness to engage with courts—a direct result of ICE’s policy.  \n  25 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 26 of 48\nPlaintiffs’ experience makes clear that the targets of ICE’s civil arrests no longer view \nMassachusetts state courts as places they can attend—a result that significantly harms not just \nPlaintiffs, but the entire Massachusetts justice system.  \n  Many noncitizen Massachusetts residents refuse to appear in Massachusetts \nstate courts for fear of civil immigration arrest. \n64.  Prior to the current administration’s civil-courthouse-arrest policy, Massachusetts \nstate courts were understood to be open to everyone, even noncitizens potentially subject to \nremoval.  Chelsea Collaborative regularly assists with its members’ litigation in Massachusetts \nstate courts, including members who are noncitizens.  Prior to the current civil-courthouse-arrest \npolicy, Chelsea Collaborative’s members, including those who are potentially subject to removal, \nwere regularly willing to participate in state court proceedings.  For example, in the past, the \nCollaborative filled courtrooms with members to show community support for the vindication of \nthe rights of other Collaborative members.   \n65.  In one instance in or around 2008, the Collaborative brought claims on behalf of \nvictims of a consumer fraud scheme involving a travel agency that promised to book travel for \nthe victims, but instead took the money and provided no services.  The Collaborative brought \nover sixty community members, including some who were potentially subject to removal, to the \ntrial to show support and to testify against the fraudsters.  Similarly, from 2013-2014, the \nCollaborative helped with a criminal prosecution related to the Chelsea Housing Authority, \nasserting the rights of its members suffering the uninhabitable conditions of Chelsea public \nhousing as a result of the then-executive director of the Housing Authority’s misappropriation of \nfunds.  The Collaborative loaded two buses of member-victims and their supporters, including \nsome who were potentially subject to removal, to appear in court on behalf of the community.  \nNone of these members expressed any fear of attending a Massachusetts courthouse. \n  26 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 27 of 48\n66.  This has completely changed because of the new policy authorizing civil \ncourthouse arrests.  Now, the Collaborative can hardly convince anyone to appear in court or \nbring suits that could ultimately require a court appearance.  With accounts of ICE officers in the \ncourthouses spreading through Massachusetts communities, and with the increased likelihood \nthat a courthouse arrest will lead to prolonged detention given other policies of the current \nadministration, noncitizens fear engagement with the courts either as witnesses, claimants, \nvictims, or supporters.  The following paragraphs provide just a few examples of the \nCollaborative’s recent experiences reflecting the pervasive fear that ICE’s presence in the \ncourthouses has instilled in the community.  These examples are not exhaustive but provide \nillustrations of the harm to Chelsea Collaborative’s members, and the type of conduct that is no \nlonger being reported and acted upon by many noncitizen Massachusetts residents. \n67.  Domestic violence victims fear reporting abuse.  Under Massachusetts General \nLaw ch. 209A, victims of domestic violence may seek abuse prevention orders where they have \na close relationship with their abuser (e.g., they are married or residing together) and they are \nsuffering physical harm at the hands of this individual.  Prior to 2017, Chelsea Collaborative \nassisted members, including noncitizens, in securing such orders.  Currently, some members of \nChelsea Collaborative are victims of domestic violence and would qualify for an abuse \nprevention order under chapter 209A.  Yet, despite encouragement by the Collaborative and \nother organizations, many noncitizen Collaborative members who are victims of domestic \nviolence and would qualify for an abuse prevention order, are now not willing to seek such an \norder because it requires going to court, where the victims fear ICE arrest for themselves and \ntheir families.  Abusers prey on the vulnerability of these victims, using the threat of deportation \nto silence survivors and drive them further into the shadows.  Though the Collaborative \n  27 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 28 of 48\nencourages victims to seek relief in court, given ICE’s Directive, the Collaborative cannot \nguarantee these victims that they can appear in court without being arrested by ICE. \n68.  The Collaborative’s experience of the chilling effect of ICE’s policy on victims of \ndomestic violence is consistent with trends that have been documented nationally.  For instance, \na survey by the National Immigrant Women’s Advocacy Project, partnering with the American \nCivil Liberties Union, found that of the prosecutors they interviewed across 19 states, “82 \npercent of prosecutors reported that since President Trump took office [in 2017], domestic \nviolence is now underreported and harder to investigate and/or prosecute [compared to in 2016].  \nSeventy percent of prosecutors reported the same for sexual assault, while 55 percent state the \nsame difficulties for human trafficking and 48 percent for child abuse.”  See American Civil \nLiberties Union, Freezing Out Justice: How immigration arrests at courthouses are undermining \nthe justice system, 2 (2018).  Similarly, the Domestic Violence Bureau of the Bronx District \nAttorney’s office has publicly reported that numerous complaining witnesses expressed fear of \ntestifying or otherwise participating in criminal proceedings due to ICE presence in the \ncourthouse, including at least one instance in which a previously cooperative complaining \nwitness became extremely reluctant to testify following several news reports regarding ICE \narrests occurring in courthouses.  There are numerous other reports of the increased refusal \namong noncitizens to report domestic violence in light of ICE’s presence in courts. \n69.  Victims of fraud refuse to seek judicial relief, fearing ICE in court.  A scam \nartist has victimized many in the Chelsea community, building false trust and security with \nunknowing victims of an investment scheme to defraud the victims of hundreds of thousands of \ndollars.  Since early 2018, this fraudster has stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars by \nconvincing Collaborative members to invest in a shell company with false promises of returns.  \n  28 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 29 of 48\nAfter months of requests for an accounting of the use of the funds and recovery of the original \ninvestment, the fraudster refuses, threatening the victims with the immigration consequences of \nappearing in court to vindicate their rights.  Despite wanting to seek relief from the courts and \nthe return of their stolen funds, and despite the fact that the conduct at issue is clearly actionable \nas fraud under Massachusetts law, the undocumented victims have refused to initiate civil claims \nagainst the fraudster due to the fear of ICE arrest upon appearing in court, and the threat that \ntheir families would be torn apart by deportation.   \n70.  Victims of church embezzlement scheme refuse to sue or assist with \nprosecution, fearing ICE in courts.  Close to fifty parishioners of a local, now-defunct church, \nincluding many Collaborative members, sought to recover $140,000 of their offerings to the \nchurch that were embezzled by a former pastor.  Due to the fear of ICE’s presence in the \ncourthouses, the noncitizen victims fear pursuing their rights in court and have sought the advice \nand help of the Collaborative.  In an effort to provide some mechanism to help these exploited \nvictims, the Collaborative instituted an ad hoc investigation in cooperation with the Suffolk \nDistrict Attorney to seek some form of justice for these victims. \n71.  Victims of employer abuses and wage theft refuse to assert their rights, \nfearing ICE in court.  Massachusetts General Law chapter 151, sections 1A-1B requires that \nemployers provide overtime of one and one-half times their regular wage for hours worked \nabove 40 hours per week and creates a cause of action to recover unpaid overtime owed under \nthese provisions.  One Collaborative member’s home was destroyed in a fire, and she took time \noff of work to relocate her family.  After returning to work, the woman was fired.  After being \nfired, she realized that she had not been paid in accordance with chapter 151 section 1A-1B, and \nthat she had not even been paid minimum wage.  Despite offers by the Collaborative to represent \n  29 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 30 of 48\nher in suing her employer to recover what she was owed under these provisions, the victim \nrefused to file a complaint in court, fearing ICE arrest.   \n72.  Victims of landlord abuses refuse to challenge illegal eviction, fearing ICE in \ncourt.  A family of noncitizens, including Collaborative members, was threatened by their \nlandlord after an illegal rent increase and notice to vacate the premises if they did not agree to the \nsubstantial rent increase.  Fearing ICE arrest if they appeared in court, the family moved out \nrather than seek relief from the landlord’s abusive and illegal tactics. \n  By making courthouses unavailable to many noncitizen residents of \nMassachusetts, ICE’s policy has injured Chelsea Collaborative’s members \nand forced Chelsea Collaborative to spend additional resources helping its \nmembers access justice and resolve disputes. \n73.  These examples alone demonstrate that ICE’s Directive and ICE’s policy of \ncivilly arresting witnesses, parties, and others attending court on official business concretely \nharm Chelsea Collaborative’s members by depriving them of a judicial forum in which to assert \ntheir rights, forcing them to endure domestic violence and employment and housing practices \nthat violate Massachusetts law. \n74.  The Directive and ICE’s policy of civilly arresting witnesses, parties, and others \nattending court on official business also harm the Collaborative by forcing it to spend and divert \nresources to assist its members in responding to ICE’s civil courthouse arrests.  Most \nimportantly, the Collaborative has instituted a mediation program to resolve disputes in the \ncommunity involving members and other Chelsea residents who refuse to go to court.  At no \npoint prior to the current administration’s civil-courthouse-arrest policy did the Collaborative \nhave to create such an alternative-dispute-resolution mechanism for its noncitizen members, \nbecause those members were always willing to resolve their disputes in court.  Now, \nCollaborative staff conduct approximately three to four mediations a week, each lasting several \n  30 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 31 of 48\nhours.  The subject matters range from resolution of family disputes, consumer fraud claims, \nwage theft allegations, and others.  This program has placed an incredible strain on the \norganization’s resources, forcing the Collaborative to divert resources it would otherwise spend \non its core mission.  Although a necessary stopgap measure, this extra-judicial program suffers \nfrom obvious shortcomings, including that participation cannot be compelled and agreements \nreached in the mediation are not enforceable as a court judgment would be.  \n75.  As discussed above, prior to ICE’s Directive and prior to ICE’s policy of \nregularly carrying out civil immigration arrests in Massachusetts courthouses, Chelsea \nCollaborative’s members regularly appeared in Massachusetts state courts.  Thus, if ICE were \nenjoined from conducting civil arrests in and around courthouses, Chelsea Collaborative’s \nmembers would be willing to appear in Massachusetts courts, and Chelsea Collaborative would \nnot need to continue its costly mediation program. \n  By making courthouses unavailable to many noncitizen Massachusetts \nresidents, ICE’s policy injures the District Attorneys and CPCS by deterring \nvictims, witnesses, and criminal defendants from appearing in court. \n76.  The criminal justice system cannot function if the key players in that system—\nvictims, witnesses, and criminal defendants—are not willing and able to appear in court. \n77.  As the above illustrations demonstrate, many noncitizen victims, witnesses, and \ndefendants are no longer willing to appear in court as a result of ICE’s policy of civil courthouse \narrests.  Crime victims, especially domestic violence victims, endure abuse rather than risk civil \nICE arrest.  Defendants sometimes refuse to appear for hearings and trials and sometimes are \nunable to appear due to ICE arrests, even in instances when the result of the hearings will most \nlikely be dismissal of the cases.  \n78.  The illustrations above are consistent with the District Attorneys’ experience.  It \nis difficult for the District Attorneys to capture the full extent of ICE’s interference with their \n  31 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 32 of 48\nwork because both the Middlesex and Suffolk District Attorneys do not generally ask victims \nand witnesses about their immigration status.  Further, even if they do ask, many victims and \nwitnesses refuse to disclose their immigration status to the District Attorneys and Assistant \nDistrict Attorneys because the victims and witnesses often do not differentiate between state \nprosecutors and federal ICE officials.  Thus, when a given victim or witness does not appear in \ncourt, it is difficult to know why that person has not appeared.   \n79.  The illustrations above are also consistent with CPCS’s experience.  When a \ngiven criminal defendant does not appear at a scheduled hearing or trial, it is sometimes difficult \nto know whether that failure was caused by fear of ICE arrest, actual ICE arrest outside the \ncourthouse prior to the hearing or trial, or some other factor.  But, like the District Attorneys, \nCPCS attorneys have noted a significant increase in criminal defendants expressing fear of \nappearing in court, and an increase in defendants’ failure to appear, since ICE’s Directive and \nsince ICE began implementing its policy of regularly carrying out arrests in state courthouses.  \nIndeed, as the Roxbury example discussed above demonstrates, criminal defendants that have \nencountered ICE in courthouses are often unwilling to appear at a subsequent hearing, even \nwhen the result of the hearing is almost certain dismissal of the criminal charges. \n80.  By causing victims, witnesses, and defendants to refuse to appear in court, ICE’s \ncivil-courthouse-arrest policy injures the District Attorneys in concrete ways:   \na.  Most importantly, it makes some prosecutions impossible.  For crimes like \ndomestic violence in which a singular victim is often the only witness, if the \nvictim is a noncitizen who is unwilling to risk ICE arrest by appearing in \ncourt, then prosecution is impossible.   \n  32 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 33 of 48\nb.  Prosecution is also impossible when the defendant refuses to appear due to \nfear of ICE arrest or fails to appear because of ICE arrest prior to resolution of \nthe criminal case.   \nc.  Even for prosecutions in which there are multiple victims and the defendant \ndoes appear, ICE’s policy sometimes makes prosecution significantly more \ncostly, time-consuming and difficult.  For example, the Suffolk County \nDistrict Attorney’s prosecution of the former pastor who stole $140,000 from \nhis congregation was significantly complicated by the fact that many of the \nvictims refused to appear in court for fear of ICE arrest.   \nd.  ICE’s courthouse arrests also force the District Attorneys’ Victim Witness \nAdvocates to spend additional time finding ways for victims and witnesses to \nfeel comfortable attending court, diverting their resources from their other \nresponsibilities.   \ne.  ICE’s courthouse arrests also force Assistant District Attorneys to spend \nsignificant time and resources preparing for hearings and trials that do not \noccur because the defendant and/or key witnesses do not appear because of \neither fear or actual ICE arrest. \n81.  Other District Attorneys in Massachusetts have noted the same problems.  For \nexample, Johnathan W. Blodgett, Essex County District Attorney, has stated that “[ICE] arrests \nat courthouses in our county have impacted witnesses appearing for trial, victims of crime \n(especially those of domestic violence), and criminal defendants we are seeking to prosecute.  \nThis practice often impedes access to justice for victims, as well as our ability to prosecute \ncases.” \n  33 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 34 of 48\n82.  For similar reasons, ICE’s civil-courthouse-arrest policy injures CPCS in concrete \nways:   \na.  Most importantly, it directly impacts CPCS in its representations.  When a \nCPCS attorney’s client fails to appear at a hearing or trial due to fear or actual \nICE arrest, the hearing or trial cannot go forward.  Moreover, if a defense \nwitness refuses to appear due to fear of ICE arrest, defending the client \nbecomes significantly more difficult, and at times impossible.   \nb.  ICE’s courthouse arrests force CPCS attorneys to spend significant time and \nresources preparing for hearings and trials that do not occur because either the \ndefendant and/or key witnesses do not appear due to fear or actual ICE arrest. \n83.  As discussed above, prior to ICE’s policy of regularly carrying out civil \nimmigration arrests in state courthouses, noncitizens potentially subject to ICE arrest did not fear \narrest upon appearing in Massachusetts courts, and regularly appeared in those courts.  Thus, if \nICE were not permitted to conduct civil arrests in and around courthouses—either by policy or \nby court order—then the District Attorneys and CPCS would no longer suffer the concrete harms \nidentified above.   \n84.  A study conducted by Northeastern University’s Immigrant Justice Clinic \nsummarized the disruptions it observed in Massachusetts courts at the hands of the ICE policy as \nfollows: \nICE  enforcement  practices  routinely  interfere  with  court \nproceedings.    ICE  frequently  arrests  immigrants  prior  to  the \nresolution of their criminal case.  ICE detention can have grave \nimpacts on a criminal proceeding, resulting in probation violations, \ndefault  warrants,  and  other  adverse  consequences.    ICE \ninterference  with  the  criminal  process  does  not  just  harm \ndefendants.  It also harms victims, whose rights are compromised \nwhen defendants are not available to stand trial, and it disrupts the \n  34 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 35 of 48\nentire  operation  of  the  courts.  In  addition,  the  climate  of  fear \ncreated by ICE courthouse enforcement deters immigrant victims \nand  witnesses  from  seeking  assistance  or  participating  in  legal \nproceedings. \nNortheastern University School of Law, Immigrant Justice Clinic, Blocking the Courthouse \nDoors:  ICE Enforcement at Massachusetts Courthouses and Its Effects on the Judicial Process, 7 \n(March 2018). \n  There has been widespread recognition, including by numerous judges, that ICE’s \npolicy of civil courthouse arrests has caused precisely the harms to the \nadministration of justice that the common law recognized. \n85.  Stakeholders participating in every facet of state judicial systems have spoken out \nabout the pervasive and destabilizing effect that ICE’s civil arrest practices have had on the \nproper functioning of this core state institution.  States have been vocal in rejecting the \ncourthouse arrest practice and in calling on ICE to terminate it entirely, or to impose significant \nlimitations on its frequency. \n86.  State court judges and justices in the Commonwealth and across the country from \nCalifornia, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, and Washington have issued multiple \nletters and public statements to ICE objecting to the courthouse arrest practice, citing to \ndisruptions to the administration of justice and public safety, and calling on ICE to substantially \nalter its practice.   \n87.  Paula M. Carey, Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Trial Court, summarized the \nnegative consequences stemming from the ICE policy as follows: \nIt is essential that these individuals [victims and litigants] be free \nto seek relief from the Court without fear that their presence in \nCourt will be the cause of an immigration enforcement action.  If \nnot, the unfortunate result will be that public safety will decrease, \ncommunities will become less safe and perpetrators of domestic \nviolence will feel empowered to abuse their victims with impunity.  \nFurther,  individuals  who  currently  come  to  our  Courts  to  help \nthemselves or a loved one in obtaining a civil commitment for \n  35 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 36 of 48\ndetox or treatment will be reluctant to come forward if they fear \nimmigration consequences. \nAny  increased  immigration  enforcement  in  these  civil  matters \nwould mean fewer applications, more withdrawn cases, and more \ndefaults, resulting inevitably in violence, injustice, and threats to \npublic safety.  In my view, it would ultimately affect the Court’s \nability  to  carry  out  its  mission  to  provide  the  protections \nguaranteed by the laws of this Commonwealth. \nExhibit G at 2. \n88.  Chief Justice Tani G. Cantil-Sakauye of the California Supreme Court wrote a \nletter to then-Attorney General Sessions, expressing concerns about ICE’s policy of arresting \nundocumented immigrants at California trial courts.  Chief Justice Cantil-Sakauye echoed \nconcerns felt by judges and lawyers across the nation:   \nOur courthouses serve as a vital forum for ensuing access to justice \nand protecting public safety. . . .  [ICE’s courthouse arrest policy is \nnot only unsafe and unfair, but] undermine[s] the judiciary’s ability \nto provide equal access to justice. \nExhibit H at 1-2.  \n89.  She further explained that ICE’s policy affects a wide array of individuals, \nincluding “[c]rime victims, victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence, witnesses to crimes \nwho are aiding law enforcement, limited-English speakers, unrepresented litigants, and children \nand families,” by limiting their ability to “come to our courts seeking justice and due process of \nlaw.”  Exhibit H at 1.  \n90.  Chief Justice Mary E. Fairhurst of the Supreme Court of Washington has also \nrecognized that the ICE courthouse arrest policy “impede[s] the fundamental mission of [all] \ncourts, which is to ensure due process and access to justice for everyone, regardless of their \nimmigration status.”  \n  36 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 37 of 48\n91.  In a joint letter, dozens of former state and federal judges stressed that “for courts \nto effectively do justice, ensure public safety, and serve their communities, the public must be \nable to access courthouses safely and without fear of retribution.  For many, however, ICE’s \ncourthouse arrests have made courts places to avoid.”  Exhibit I at 1.  \n92.  These judges also recognized that the ICE policy has caused recognizable and \ntangible fear in individuals who would otherwise petition courts for redress:   \nSurveys of law enforcement and legal service providers confirm \nthat ICE’s reliance on immigration arrests in courthouses instills \nfear in clients and deters them from seeking justice in a court \nbuilding.  Affidavits detail persons “terrified” to request orders \nprotecting them from violence or enforcing child support, to serve \nas witnesses, and to defend themselves. \nExhibit I at 1.   \n93.  The Victim Rights Law Center has also seen the ICE courthouse arrest policy’s \nchilling effect in action, expressing that “The immigrant [sexual assault] survivors we work with \nunanimously express significant fear of detention or deportation when contemplating engaging in \ncriminal justice and/or civil legal remedies in the aftermath of their assaults.”  \n94.  The Boston Bar Association believes that the chilling effect that ICE courthouse \narrests fosters has “significantly impair[ed] the ability of the Commonwealth to ensure access to \nour courts and fair administration of justice for all our residents.”   \n95.  Similarly, the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute has summarized the negative \nimpact of the ICE courthouse arrest policy as follows:  \nThe recent ICE presence in the courthouses of the Commonwealth \n. . . has already chilled access to civil legal remedies by legal \nservices clients and is likely to imperil the participation of litigants \nand witnesses in key areas of our practice, including the following: \n[Housing,  Child  Welfare,  Family  Law,  Domestic  Abuse  and \nHarassment Protection, and Employment Rights]. \n*  *  * \n  37 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 38 of 48\n96.  A clear consensus has emerged in Massachusetts, and across the nation, among all \nstakeholders in the legal community that ICE’s civil-courthouse-arrest policy has resulted in a \nnoticeable chill on court access, and as a result, on access to justice.  Massachusetts judges, \nprosecutors, defense attorneys, and legal aid societies are united against this destructive ICE \npolicy.  These stakeholders agree that ICE courthouse arrests at the very least chill—and in some \ncases, outright prevent—noncitizens from accessing courthouses, and in turn justice, across \nMassachusetts.   \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nCOUNT I \nICE’s Directive No. 11072.1 Violates the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), \nand the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1226(a), 1357(a) (by all \nPlaintiffs) \n97.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained \nin paragraphs 1 through 96 as if fully set forth herein. \n98.  The Administrative Procedure Act instructs courts to “hold unlawful and set aside \nagency action” that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with law,” as well as agency action that is “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, \nauthority, or limitations.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2).   \n99.  ICE’s Directive is a final agency action subject to review under the \nAdministrative Procedure Act. \n100.  Congress has not given ICE the power to conduct civil arrests of parties, \nwitnesses and others attending court on official business.  “[A]n agency literally has no power to \nact . . . unless and until Congress confers power upon it.”  Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. \nF.C.C., 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986).  The validity of ICE’s Directive authorizing civil arrest of \nparties and witnesses attending court thus depends on whether the general grant of power to \n  38 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 39 of 48\nconduct civil arrests somehow abrogated the well-settled common law privilege that such civil \narrests cannot be used to arrest parties, witnesses and others attending court on official business.   \n101.  Given the “longstanding [] principle that statutes which invade the common law \nare to be read with a presumption favoring the retention of long-established and familiar \nprinciples,” a statute must “speak directly to the question addressed by the common law” to \n“abrogate a common-law principle.”  Texas, 507 U.S. at 534 (1993) (internal quotation marks \nand alterations omitted).  The statute authorizing ICE to conduct civil immigration arrests does \nnot “speak directly to the question addressed by the common law”—i.e., it does not speak to the \nquestion of whether ICE can use a party or witness’s appearance in court as a trap for purposes \nof a civil arrest.  Instead, the statute simply authorizes arrest and detention, while saying nothing \nabout how, when, or where such arrests can take place.  8 U.S.C. § 1226(a), 1357(a).  Thus, the \npower Congress granted to ICE to conduct civil arrests inherently contains within it the common-\nlaw limitation that parties, witnesses, and others attending court on official business are \nprivileged from civil arrest. \n102.  To the extent there is any ambiguity concerning whether the INA incorporates or \nabrogates the common-law privilege, the constitutional concerns raised by the Directive resolve \nthat ambiguity in favor of interpreting the statute to limit ICE’s authority.  See Clark v. Martinez, \n543 U.S. 371, 380-82 (2005) (when there are “competing plausible interpretations of a statutory \ntext,” courts should apply “the reasonable presumption that Congress did not intend the \nalternative which raises serious constitutional doubts”).   \n103.  Abrogating the common-law privilege would violate the Constitutional right of \naccess to the courts, which prohibits “systemic official action [that] frustrates a plaintiff or \nplaintiff class in preparing and filing suits.”  Christopher, 536 U.S. at 413, 415 & n.12.  Such \n  39 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 40 of 48\n“frustrat[ion]” includes not only policies that ban access outright, but also those that obstruct it.  \nE.g., id. at 413.  Forcing noncitizen litigants potentially subject to removal to risk civil arrest in \norder to access the courts creates such impermissible frustration.  See ¶¶ 118-122, infra. \n104.  Abrogating the privilege would likely deprive criminal defendants of their Sixth \nAmendment rights.  A “fundamental element of due process of law” is criminal defendants’ \n“right to present a defense,” which includes the “right to offer the testimony of witnesses, and to \ncompel their attendance, if necessary.”  Washington v. Texas, 388 U.S. 14, 19 (1967).  \nGovernment acts that “cause[] the loss or erosion” of favorable testimony violate that right.  \nUnited States v. Hoffman, 832 F.2d 1299, 1303 (1st Cir.1987).  By conditioning court appearance \non potential civil arrest, ICE’s Directive threatens noncitizen witnesses with potential arrest upon \nappearance in court, likely depriving many criminal defendants of key testimony.  Criminal \ndefendants also have the right to testify on their own behalf, e.g., Rock v. Arkansas, 483 U.S. 44, \n51-53 (1987), and to be present at crucial phases of the trial, e.g., Illinois v. Allen, 397 U.S. 337, \n338 (1970).  ICE’s Directive impermissibly conditions a criminal defendant’s exercise of these \nrights on exposing herself to potential civil immigration arrest. \n105.  The federalism and Tenth Amendment concerns involved with abrogating state \ncourts’ ability to protect their litigants and witnesses from courthouse arrests further supports \ninterpreting Congress’s general grant of civil-arrest authority to incorporate the common-law \nprivilege against courthouse arrests.  If Congress intends to “pre-empt the historic powers of the \nStates,” it must do so “plain[ly]”—making its intention “unmistakably clear”—in \nacknowledgment of the fact that “States retain substantial sovereign powers under our \nconstitutional scheme, powers with which Congress does not readily interfere.”  Gregory v. \nAshcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 460-61 (1991).  Authorizing ICE to police the halls of state courts—\n  40 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 41 of 48\ndissuading parties and witnesses from attending state judicial proceedings—creates a serious \nthreat to the “usual constitutional balance between the States and the Federal Government.”  Id. \nat 460-61.  Indeed, authorizing such conduct effectively commandeers state resources for \nimplementing a federal program.  See ¶¶ 112-117, infra.  Such authorization should not be \npresumed absent express language not present in the statute.   \n106.  ICE’s Directive authorizes civil courthouse arrests that Congress did not authorize \nICE to conduct.  The Directive is thus “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or \nlimitations,” and is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance \nwith law.”  This Court should therefore hold it unlawful and set it aside under the Administrative \nProcedure Act. \nCOUNT II  \nICE’s Directive No. 11072.1, and Its Policy of Conducting Civil Courthouse Arrests, \nViolate the Federal and Massachusetts Common-Law Privilege Against Such \nArrests (by all Plaintiffs) \n107.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained \nin paragraphs 1 through 106 as if fully set forth herein. \n108.  ICE’s arrests based on alleged civil immigration infractions are civil arrests.  See \nINS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1038 (1984) (“A deportation proceeding is a purely civil \naction to determine eligibility to remain in this country”). \n109.  There is a longstanding common-law privilege against civil arrest of witnesses, \nparties, and others attending court on official business.  This privilege has been recognized by \nfederal courts, including the Supreme Court and this Court, as well as by the Massachusetts \nSupreme Judicial Court.  The privilege is one that courts enforce on each other’s behalf.  Federal \ncourts enforce the privilege on behalf of those attending state courts, and state courts enforce the \n  41 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 42 of 48\nprivilege on behalf of those attending federal courts.  The privilege is thus best understood as \nexisting as a matter of both federal and Massachusetts common law.   \n110.  The federal common law privilege must, at the very least, prevent arrest of those \nattending state court to the extent those arrests are privileged under state law.   \n111.  ICE’s Directive, and its policy of carrying out civil arrests against parties, \nwitnesses, and others attending courts on official business, violate the privilege against civil \ncourthouse arrests.   \nCOUNT III  \nICE’s Directive No. 11072.1, and Its Policy of Conducting Civil Courthouse Arrests, \nExceed the Federal Government’s Powers Under the Tenth Amendment (by all \nPlaintiffs) \n112.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained \nin paragraphs 1 through 111 as if fully set forth herein. \n113.  The Constitution leaves in the states “‘a residuary and inviolable sovereignty.’”  \nPrintz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 918-19 (1997) (quoting The Federalist No. 39, at 245 (J. \nMadison)).  Key to protecting this “inviolable sovereignty” is the states’ ability to prevent the \nfederal government from conscripting key state functions for its own end:  “[U]sing the States as \nthe instruments of federal governance [is] both ineffectual and provocative of federal-state \nconflict.”  Id.  The Supreme Court has thus repeatedly “made clear that the Federal Government \nmay not compel the States to implement, by legislation or executive action, federal regulatory \nprograms.”  Id. at 925; see also Murphy v. Nat’l Collegiate Athletic Ass’n, 138 S. Ct. 1461 \n(2018). \n114.  The states’ judicial and police powers are among the most important powers that \nthe Constitution reserves to the states.  Indeed, there is “no better example of the police power, \nwhich the Founders denied the National Government and reposed in the States, than the \n  42 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 43 of 48\nsuppression of violent crime and vindication of its victims.”  United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. \n598, 618 (2000); see also United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 567 (1995) (discussing “areas \nsuch as criminal law enforcement . . . where states historically have been sovereign”).  There is \ntherefore particular reason to avoid allowing the federal government to coopt that system for \npurposes of carrying out its own civil policies, especially when such cooption interferes with the \nstate’s administration of its police powers. \n115.  ICE’s Directive, and its corresponding policy of civilly arresting parties, \nwitnesses, and others attending court on official business, impermissibly commandeer the state \ncriminal justice and judiciary systems for purposes of carrying out the federal government’s civil \nimmigration policy.  There can be little doubt that the federal government could not order state \ndistrict attorneys, public defenders, and judges to provide ICE with lists of people who the state \nofficers know are scheduled to appear in court—let alone, to make those people available for \nICE arrest.  See Murphy, 138 S. Ct. at 1477 (“The Federal Government may not command the \nStates’ officers, or those of their political subdivisions, to administer or enforce a federal \nregulatory program.” (internal alterations and citations omitted)).  However, that is precisely the \neffect of ICE’s civil-courthouse-arrest policy, which simply places federal officials in state \ncourthouses to accomplish indirectly what the federal government could not permissibly do \ndirectly.  Stationing armed federal agents within the state government to extract what the federal \ngovernment could not order the state to provide directly heightens, not minimizes, the intrusion \non state sovereignty.  See Murphy, 138 S. Ct. at 1478 (telling the state legislature it cannot do \nsomething is “as if federal officers were installed in state legislative chambers and were armed \nwith the authority to stop legislators from voting on any offending proposals.  A more direct \naffront to state sovereignty is not easy to imagine.”). \n  43 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 44 of 48\n116.  The federal government’s use of state courts for civil immigration enforcement \nshifts the political accountability for and the economic costs of federal immigration policy to the \nstates in precisely the way the Tenth Amendment prohibits.  See Murphy, 138 S. Ct. at 1477.  \nWhen those called into court by state prosecutors or state judges are then arrested by federal \nagents upon appearing in state court, it becomes difficult for members of the public to attribute \nresponsibility for the arrests.  Similarly, ICE’s Directive and corresponding policy of arresting \nthose attending state courts on official business shift the costs of immigration enforcement from \nthe federal government to the states.  The federal government saves money by using the state \njudicial system to trap those the federal government seeks to civilly arrest and detain, while \nplacing significant strains on state resources by requiring the involvement of state court officers, \nhindering the state judicial process, and making the state’s administration of justice more costly, \nslow, and disordered.   \n117.  The Tenth Amendment violation is made more acute by the importance of the \nstate institutions ICE is commandeering, and the significance of ICE’s interference with those \ninstitutions.  The execution of the police power and the administration of justice are core \nsovereign powers reserved to the states.  See Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 43 (1971) \n(recognizing a “policy against federal court interference with state judicial proceedings”); In re \nJustices of Superior Court Dep’t of Massachusetts Trial Court, 218 F.3d 11, 16 (1st Cir. 2000) \n(same); Morrison, 529 U.S. at 618 (“we can think of no better example of the police power, \nwhich the Founders denied the National Government and reposed in the States, than the \nsuppression of violent crime and vindication of its victims.”); United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. \n549, 564, 567 (1995) (“areas such as criminal law enforcement or education where states \n  44 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 45 of 48\nhistorically have been sovereign.”).  ICE’s Directive and civil-courthouse-arrest policy \nsignificantly interfere with these core sovereign functions and violate the Tenth Amendment. \nCOUNT IV \nICE’s Directive No. 11072.1, and Its Policy of Conducting Civil Courthouse Arrests, \nViolate the Right of Access to the Courts (by Chelsea Collaborative) \n118.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained \nin paragraphs 1 through 117 as if fully set forth herein. \n119.  Defendants’ actions deprive Plaintiffs of meaningful access to the courts in \nviolation of Plaintiffs’ rights under the First, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.   \n120.  The right of access to the courts prohibits “systemic official action [that] frustrates \na plaintiff or plaintiff class in preparing and filing suits.”  Christopher, 536 U.S. at 413, 415 & \nn.12; see also Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 522-23 (2004); Rogan v. City of Boston, 267 \nF.3d 24, 28 (1st Cir. 2001); Simmons v. Dickhaut, 804 F.2d 182, 183 (1st Cir. 1986).  Such \n“frustrat[ion]” includes not only policies that ban access outright, but also those that obstruct it in \nmore subtle ways.  See Christopher, 536 U.S. at 413 (citing M.L.B. v. S.L.J., 519 U.S. 102, 106-\n07 (1996)) (excessive filing fees); Lane, 541 U.S. at 522-23 (inaccessibility for individuals with \ndisabilities); see also Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817, 822 (1977) (“access to the courts [must be] \nadequate, effective, and meaningful”).   \n121.  Forcing noncitizens potentially subject to removal to risk civil arrest to access the \ncourts creates such impermissible frustration.  Indeed, the cases establishing the common-law \nprivilege recognized precisely this, explaining that the fear of arrest would “prevent [parties and \nwitnesses’] approach,” obstructing “the administration of justice.”  Halsey, 4 N.J.L. at 368.  The \nimpact of ICE’s Directive has vindicated this common-law wisdom:  Noncitizen victims of \ndomestic violence and landlord and employer abuse have been forced to continue to suffer abuse \nand decline to obtain remedies available under Massachusetts law rather than risk ICE arrest.  \n  45 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 46 of 48\nPlaintiff Chelsea Collaborative has been forced to establish its own extra-judicial mediation \nprogram to resolve disputes between those who are no longer willing to attend court. \n122.  Chelsea Collaborative’s members have meritorious claims—including claims for \nrestraining orders against abusive partners and unpaid wages against former employers—that \nthey are frustrated from bringing by ICE’s civil-courthouse-arrest policy, in violation of the \nConstitutional right of access to the courts. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWherefore, Plaintiffs pray that this Court grant the following relief:  \nA.  An order holding unlawful, vacating, and setting aside ICE’s Directive No. 11072.1 \nauthorizing the civil arrest of parties, witnesses, and others attending court on official \nbusiness. \nB.  A declaration pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201 that: \na.   ICE does not have statutory authority to civilly arrest parties, witnesses and \nothers attending court on official business, and hence ICE’s Directive is in excess \nof statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, and is arbitrary, capricious, an \nabuse of discretion, and not in accordance with law; \nb.  ICE’s Directive and ICE’s policy of civilly arresting parties, witnesses and others \nattending court on official business violate the federal and Massachusetts \ncommon-law privilege against such civil courthouse arrests; \nc.  ICE’s Directive and ICE’s policy of civilly arresting parties, witnesses and others \nattending court on official business violate the constitutional right of access to the \ncourts; and \n  46 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 47 of 48\nd.  ICE’s Directive and ICE’s policy of civilly arresting parties, witnesses and others \nattending court on official business exceed the federal government’s \nconstitutional authority under the Tenth Amendment. \nC.  An injunction enjoining ICE from implementing its Directive, and from civilly arresting \nparties, witnesses, and others appearing in court on official business while they are going \nto, attending, or leaving the courthouse.   \nD.  Attorneys’ fees. \nE.  Such other relief as the Court deems just and proper. \n   \n  47 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 1   Filed 04/29/19   Page 48 of 48\nDated: April 29, 2019  Respectfully submitted, \n   \n/s/ David J.

I.N.S., 208 F.3d 299, 307 (1st Cir. \n2000).  Exercising  that  “plenary”  and  “pervasive”  authority,  id.,  Congress  has  codified  the \nExecutive Branch’s constitutional and inherent authority to investigate, arrest, and detain aliens \nwho are suspected of being, or found to be, unlawfully present in the United States. See 8 U.S.C. \n§§ 1182, 1225, 1226, 1231, 1357. The Executive may, among other things, arrest aliens with or \nwithout a warrant pending a decision on whether they are to be removed from the United States. \nId., §§ 1226(a), 1357(a)(2). Upon arrest, an immigration court normally decides whether detention \nis appropriate. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) has long exercised its arrest \nauthority in and around courthouses given its strong interest in removing aliens engaging in \ncriminal  activity.  ICE  recently  promulgated,  ICE  Directive  11072.1:  Civil  Immigration \nEnforcement Inside Courthouses (Ex. A), articulating revised policy guidance for the exercise of \nICE’s discretionary arrest authority in federal and state courthouses. Per the Directive, ICE targets \naliens convicted of crimes, gang members, national security of public safety risks, and aliens \nsubject to final orders of removal or who have illegally reentered the country.  \n  Notwithstanding  the  Executive’s  “broad”  and  “undoubted  power”  to  implement  its \nstatutory arrest authority, Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 394 (2012), Plaintiffs, two \nMassachusetts District Attorneys (DAs), a public defender agency, and an organization, assert that \nICE Directive 11072.1 exceeds ICE’s authority under 8 U.S.C. §§ 1226 and 1357, and therefore \nviolates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Specifically, Plaintiffs contend that a purported \n“common-law privilege against civil courthouse arrests,” Compl. ¶ 2, precludes the Executive from \nexercising its arrest authority under sections 1226 and 1357, and that the ICE Directive thus is \n1  \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 34   Filed 05/15/19   Page 3 of 29\narbitrary and capricious because it is “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations.” \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). Based on that single claim—and even though this case is not a class action—\nPlaintiffs  seek  a  nationwide  preliminary  injunction  prohibiting  ICE  from  implementing  the \nDirective. Compl., Prayer For Relief (C).  \n  The motion should be denied. To start, Plaintiffs, none of whom are aliens subject to ICE \narrest or detention, lack Article III standing or a cognizable cause of action. Moreover, the \nDirective is unreviewable under the APA because it is committed to agency discretion by law, and \nbecause it is not final agency action under the APA. 5 U.S.C. §§ 701(a)(2), 704. Further, Plaintiffs’ \nreliance on an “absolute common-law privilege against civil arrest of those attending court on \nofficial business,” Mot. 1, fails for two reasons: (1) federal common law has never provided \nimmunity from immigration enforcement; and (2) even if the common law once conferred such \nimmunity, Congress abrogated it by enacting a comprehensive immigration arrest and detention \nscheme. And Plaintiffs cannot assert any harm that outweighs the harm that the government suffers \nwhen it is unable to enforce the immigration laws. Accordingly, the Court should deny Plaintiffs’ \nmotion. \nBACKGROUND \nFederal law. The federal government “has broad, undoubted power over the subject of \nimmigration and the status of aliens.” Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 394 (2012); see U.S. \nConst.  art.  I,  § 8,  cl.  4  (granting  Congress  the  power  to  “establish  an  uniform  Rule  of \nNaturalization”). Pursuant to that power, Congress has provided that “[o]n a warrant issued by the \nAttorney General, an alien may be arrested and detained pending a decision on whether the alien \n2  \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 34   Filed 05/15/19   Page 4 of 29\nis to be removed from the United States.”1 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a). Congress also has provided that \n“without [a] warrant,” a federal officer may “arrest any alien in the United States, if he has reason \nto believe that the alien so arrested is in the United States in violation of any [] law or regulation \nand is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained for his arrest.” Id. § 1357(a)(2). These \nstatutes confer arrest authority that is generally plenary and unqualified. \nThe arrest is a critical component for initiating removal proceedings before an immigration \njudge. Those proceedings are initiated through the issuance of a Notice to Appear (NTA), which \nICE files with the immigration court. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1239.1(a), 1003.14, 1003.18. First ICE, through \nan initial custody assessment, id. § 236.1(c)(8, and then an immigration court, through a bond \ndetermination  “at  the  earliest  possible  date,”  will  consider  if  detention  is  necessary  during \nimmigration proceedings. See Immigration Court Practice Manual, Chapter 9.3(d). If the alien is \nsubject to mandatory detention based on prior serious criminal activity, the immigration judge will \naddress whether the alien qualifies for such detention. Matter of Joseph, 22 I&N Dec. 799 (BIA \n1999). An alien may appeal any decision of the immigration court, including a bond decision, to \nthe Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”).  8 C.F.R. § 1003.38. An alien also may move to \nterminate  removal  proceedings  on  constitutional,  statutory,  or  regulatory  grounds,  and  may \npetition for review of any BIA decision in the U.S. Courts of Appeals. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(5). \nPrior Guidance and Directive 11072.1. ICE has long exercised its arrest authority at and \naround courthouses given its strong interest in removing aliens who engage in criminal activity, \noften pursuant to a detainer issued to another law enforcement agency with custody of an alien to \nobtain a direct transfer of an alien once state or federal criminal proceedings and detention has \n                                                           \n1 Congress has transferred immigration enforcement functions from the Attorney General to the \nSecretary of Homeland Security. 6 U.S.C. § 251; Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 374 n.1 (2005).   \n3  \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 34   Filed 05/15/19   Page 5 of 29\nconcluded.  Since  at  least  2014,  ICE  policy  has  permitted  courthouse  arrests  in  limited \ncircumstances. Enforcement Actions at or Near Courthouses (Mar. 19, 2014) (Ex. B). In a 2014 \npolicy, ICE explained that arrests in and around courthouses was important to ensure that aliens \nconvicted of crimes, gang members (16 years or older), and national security or public safety risks \ncan be safely apprehended for removal. Id. The 2014 policy restricted enforcement actions against \n“collaterally” present aliens, “such as family members and friends” of the “target alien” and \ndirected that enforcement actions should, “whenever practicable,” “take place outside public areas \nof the courthouse,” “be conducted in collaboration with court security and staff,” and “utilize the \ncourt building’s non-public entrances and exits.” Id.  \nUntil  recently,  the  state  courts  of  Massachusetts  generally  cooperated  with  federal \nimmigration enforcement efforts, including ICE’s courthouse enforcement policy. However, in \n2017 the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts held that State judicial and law-enforcement \nofficers lack authority to transfer detainees to the federal government in civil immigration matters. \nLunn v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 517, 531 (2017); see also Mass. Executive Office of the Trial \nCourt,  Policy  and  Procedures  Regarding  Courthouse  Interactions  with  the  Department  of \nHomeland Security (Nov. 8, 2017) (“Trial Court employees shall not hold any individual who \nwould otherwise be entitled to release based solely on a civil immigration detainer or civil \nimmigration  warrant.”).  Accordingly,  in  Massachusetts,  many  dangerous  aliens  involved  in \ncriminal activity who were previously transferred to ICE custody in secure locations like jails or \nprisons,  are  now  released  to  the  streets  often  immediately  following  proceedings  in  state \ncourthouses. ICE, FAQ on Sensitive Locations and Courthouse Arrests, ECF 1-3. Massachusetts \nlaw leaves courthouses as one of the few places where “safety risks for the arresting officers, the \narrestee, and members of the community are substantially diminished.” Id. \n4  \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 34   Filed 05/15/19   Page 6 of 29\nIn 2018, ICE promulgated Directive 11072.1 (the “Directive”), which revised ICE’s policy \n“regarding civil immigration enforcement actions” in courthouses. The Directive indicates that \ncourthouse arrests can be operationally necessary when local jurisdictions decline “to cooperate \nwith ICE in the transfer of custody of aliens from” secure locations like “their prisons and jails” \nbecause,  given  that  persons  who  enter  courthouses  are  typically  screened  for  weapons, \n“immigration enforcement actions taken inside courthouses can reduce safety risks to the public, \ntargeted alien(s), and ICE officers and agents.” Id. The Directive substantively differs from the \n2014 policy only in two main respects: (1) it adds two categories of targeted aliens: “aliens who \nhave re-entered the country illegally after being removed” (a federal felony under 8 U.S.C. § 1326) \nand “aliens who have been ordered removed from the United States but have failed to depart,” and \n(2) it articulates “exceptional circumstances” in which ICE may arrest non-target aliens, such as \n“when the individual poses a threat to public safety or interferes with ICE’s enforcement actions.” \nECF 1-4 at 1. As to witnesses and victims of crimes (including domestic violence), ICE policy and \n8 U.S.C. § 1367 set additional limitations, which have remained unchanged for nearly a decade. \nMem. on Prosecutorial Discretion: Certain Victims, Witnesses, and Plaintiffs (June 17, 2011) (Ex. \nC). The Directive instructs ICE officers “generally [to] avoid enforcement actions in courthouses,” \nand proscribes enforcement in areas “that are dedicated to non-criminal (e.g. family court, small \nclaims court) proceedings.” Id. at 2.  \nUnder the Directive, when an enforcement action inside a courthouse is “operationally \nnecessary,” it may be conducted with the approval of a high-level officer. Id. at 1. The Directive \n“has provisions that attempt to make enforcement actions within courthouses orderly, safe, and \nnondisruptive.” Matter of Doe, No. SJ-2018-119 (Mass. Sup. Jud. Ct. Sept. 18, 2018), ECF 7-7 at \n7 n.5. It mandates that, “when practicable,” ICE officers “conduct enforcement actions discreetly \n5  \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 34   Filed 05/15/19   Page 7 of 29\nto minimize their impact on court proceedings.” ECF 1-4 at 1. In line with prior policy, the \nDirective states that enforcement actions in courthouses “should, to the extent practicable, continue \nto take place in non-public areas of the courthouse, be conducted in collaboration with court \nsecurity staff, and utilize the court building’s non-public entrances and exits.” Id. at 3. It directs \nICE officers and agents to “exercise sound judgment” and “make substantial efforts to avoid \nunnecessarily alarming the public;” and it requires them to “make every effort to limit their time \nat courthouses while conducting civil immigration enforcement actions.” Id. Thus, the Directive \nstrikes a balance between ICE’s legitimate interests in enforcing immigration law, protecting the \nsafety of its officers, and minimizing interference with judicial proceedings.  \nProcedural Background. On April 29, 2019, Plaintiffs filed their complaint and the instant \nmotion for preliminary injunction. ECF No. 6. Plaintiffs are: the Middlesex County and Suffolk \nCounty DAs (the “DAs”); the Committee for Public Counsel Services (“CPCS”), Massachusetts’ \npublic defender agency; and the Chelsea Collaborative (the “Collaborative”), “an organization \ndedicated to the needs of the community of Chelsea.” Compl. ¶¶ 11, 12, 14, 16. The complaint \nasserts four claims, but Plaintiffs seek preliminary injunctive relief only on Count One. See Mot. \n9 (“[T]his Court need only reach the first [claim]”). In Count One, Plaintiffs claim that the 2018 \nICE Directive violates the APA because it is “not in accordance with” ICE’s statutory authority \nunder the INA. According to Plaintiffs, ICE’s statutory arrest authority “inherently contains within \nit the common-law limitation that parties, witnesses, and others attending court on official business \nare privileged from civil arrest.” Compl. ¶ 101. For preliminary relief on Count One, Plaintiffs ask \nthe Court to enjoin ICE “from implementing [the] Directive, and from arresting individuals \nattending court on official business, during the pendency of this suit.” Mot. 20. \n \n6  \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 34   Filed 05/15/19   Page 8 of 29\nARGUMENT \nA.  Plaintiffs Lack Article III Standing and Are Not Within the INA’s Zone of Interests. \nFederal courts sit to decide cases and controversies, not to resolve disagreements about \npolicy or politics. DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 341 (2006). Article III standing \n“is an essential and unchanging part of the case-or-controversy requirement.” Lujan v. Defs. of \nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 576 (1992). To establish standing, a plaintiff must show that (1) it suffered \nan injury in fact to a legally protected interest; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged \nconduct; and (3) the injury is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision. Spokeo, Inc. \nv. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016).  \nIn Count One (the sole count on which Plaintiffs move for preliminary relief), Plaintiffs \nclaim that the ICE Directive is not “in accordance with” the INA. Compl. ¶¶ 97-106. At the outset, \nall Plaintiffs lack a legally protected interest sufficient to establish an Article III injury because the \nalleged privilege against arrest applies, if at all, only to individuals conducting court business in \nspecific litigation. The privilege, like any privilege, does not exist as an abstract legal right that \nany citizen or organization can invoke on behalf of non-litigants. See 9A Charles Alan Wright & \nArthur R. Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure § 2463.1 (3d ed. 2019) (party must invoke “a \npersonal right or privilege”). The challenged policy applies only to certain aliens—generally those \ninvolved  in  criminal  activity—who  are  subject  to  immigration  detention  to  allow  removal \nproceedings or removal efforts to be commenced. Thus, only a “person arrested by ICE in a \nMassachusetts courthouse” would have standing to invoke it. See Matter of C. Doe, No. SJ-2018-\n119 at 5 (Mass. Sept. 18, 2018), ECF No. 7-7, at 9–10; cf. N. Light Tech., Inc. v. N. Lights Club, \n236 F.3d 57, 63 (1st Cir. 2001) (rejecting, “[i]n lieu of a specific request for immunity” from \nprocess by a specific individual, a request “to fashion a broad, per se” rule of immunity unmoored \n7  \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 34   Filed 05/15/19   Page 9 of 29\nfor a specific person’s situation).  And even if Plaintiffs could assert the privilege, they would lack \nstanding and not be within the statutory zone of interests.  \n1.  ICE Has Not Prosecuted Plaintiffs or Threatened to Do So. \nA party “lacks standing to contest the policies of the prosecuting authority when he himself \nis neither prosecuted nor threatened with prosecution.” Linda R.S. v. Richard D., 410 U.S. 614, \n619 (1973). That is because a third party “lacks a judicially cognizable interest in the prosecution \nor nonprosecution of another,” id., including “enforcement of the immigration laws” against \nsomeone else. Sure-Tan, Inc. v. N.L.R.B., 467 U.S. 883, 897 (1984). Plaintiffs challenge a policy \nthat articulates circumstances in which ICE may conduct enforcement actions against individual \naliens. Plaintiffs, who are not individuals, do not face a threat that the Directive will be applied \nagainst them. Because they seek to “contest the policies of the prosecuting authority” as applied \nto others, their alleged incidental harms—increased costs and diverted resources—do not establish \nstanding.2 Linda, 410 U.S. at 619.  \n2.  The DAs and Public Defenders Lack a Cognizable Injury in Fact. \nThe DAs and CPCS lack a judicially cognizable injury. They appear to assert standing on \nthe basis that the ICE Directive increases their costs, diverts their resources, and makes their \nprosecutions more “time consuming and difficult.” Compl. ¶¶ 80, 82. These alleged difficulties do \nnot constitute a cognizable injury. In our system of dual sovereignty, state actors regularly incur \n                                                           \n2 Plaintiffs lack cognizable injury of their own, and so cannot establish standing to sue on behalf \nof third-parties. See Eulitt ex rel. Eulitt v. Maine, Dep't of Educ., 386 F.3d 344, 351 (1st Cir. 2004); \nParinejad v. ICE, 501 F. Supp. 2d 280, 283 n.3 (D. Mass. 2007). Also, Plaintiffs do not show that \nthey have “a close relationship to the third party” aliens who may be arrested in courthouses, or \n“that some hindrance exists that prevents the third party from protecting its own interest.” Id. \n8  \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 34   Filed 05/15/19   Page 10 of 29\ncosts that result incidentally from federal action. See New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, \n162-66 (1992). Such costs are not cognizable injuries under Article III. See Massachusetts v. \nMellon, 262 U.S. 447, 488 (1923). Indeed, a state actor “possesses no legitimate interest in \nprotecting its citizens from the government of the United States.” Virginia ex rel. Cuccinelli v. \nSebelius, 656 F.3d 253, 269 (4th Cir. 2011). On this point, the DAs and CPCS allege that state \ndefendants and “key witnesses” fear arrest by ICE; that these fears make defendants and witnesses \nless likely to attend court proceedings; and that when defendants and witnesses do not attend court, \nthe DAs’ and CPCS’ duties become more difficult. Compl. ¶¶ 80, 82. For one, as will be explained \nbelow, the 2018 policy does not substantially impact ICE’s policy relating to witnesses, which was \npromulgated in 2011.  More importantly, these alleged difficulties do not suffice to establish \nstanding because, if they did, a state prosecutor would have standing to challenge any federal \ncriminal statute under which a state defendant or key witness feared arrest. A fugitive from federal \ncriminal law-enforcement officials surely feels as “[un]comfortable attending court” as a fugitive \nfrom civil immigration arrest. Compl. ¶ 80. Defendants are not aware of any case in which a court \nfound that a state prosecutor had standing to challenge a federal law on the basis that the law made \nher prosecutorial duties more difficult. A state prosecutor does not suffer an injury in fact merely \nbecause a federal law-enforcement action (or the threat of it) increases the time or costs associated \nwith state prosecutions. Thus, the DAs and public defenders lack standing. 3 \n                                                           \n3 The DAs may not invoke parens patriae standing. Although a state may sue on behalf of its \ncitizens, a county or other political subdivision may not do so. Aderholt v. Bureau of Land Mgmt., \nNo. 7:15-CV-162, 2016 WL 3541857, at *7 (N.D. Tex. June 29, 2016) (collecting authorities). \n“The power of a political subdivision of a state is ‘derivative and not sovereign,’ and it may only \nsue to vindicate its own interests.” Prince George's Cty., Md. v. Levi, 79 F.R.D. 1, 4 (D. Md. 1977). \n9  \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 34   Filed 05/15/19   Page 11 of 29\n3.  All Plaintiffs Lack Any Injury that Is Traceable to the Directive. \nEven if Plaintiffs alleged judicially cognizable injuries, those injuries would not be fairly \ntraceable to the ICE Directive because they “result[] from the independent action of some third \nparty not before the court.” Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 41-42 (1976).  Like \nthe DAs, CPCS alleges that the Directive causes defendants and witnesses to fear courthouse \narrests, which makes CPCS’s “representations . . . more difficult” and “force[s]” CPCS to expend \nadditional resources.” Compl. ¶ 82. The Collaborative similarly alleges that the Directive causes \nits members to fear courthouse arrests, which “forc[es] it to spend and divert resources.” Id. ¶ 74.  \nBut these alleged injuries are caused by third-party aliens’ decisions not to attend Massachusetts \ncourts in an effort to evade arrest and removal proceedings. That evasive conduct breaks the chain \nof causation between the ICE Directive and Plaintiffs’ putative injuries, “[b]ecause the opposing \nparty must be the source of the harm,” so “causation is absent if the injury stems from the \nindependent action of a third party” Katz v. Pershing, LLC, 672 F.3d 64, 71–72 (1st Cir. 2012); \nsee Simon, 426 U.S. at 42–43 (no standing where plaintiffs alleged that government policy harmed \nthem, but alleged harm depended on speculation as to third-party conduct). Indeed, with or without \nthe Directive, aliens may avoid courthouses in an effort to avoid arrest by ICE, so Plaintiffs cannot \nshow that “invalidating [the Directive] will be reasonably likely to cause” third party aliens seeking \nto avoid arrest or removal to come to court. See Renal Physicians Ass’n v. U.S. HHS., 489 F.3d \n1267,  1276  (D.C.  Cir.  2007).  Moreover,  aliens  lack  a  cognizable  interest  in  evading  law \nenforcement, so a fortiori, Plaintiffs lack an injury that is traceable to the Directive.  See Initiative \n& Referendum Inst. v. Walker, 450 F.3d 1082, 1093 (10th Cir. 2006) (“[A] person complaining \nthat government action will make his criminal activity more difficult lacks standing because his \ninterest is not ‘legally protected.’”); Jadeja v. Redflex Traffic Sys, 764 F. Supp. 2d 1192, 1196 \n10  \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 34   Filed 05/15/19   Page 12 of 29\n(N.D. Cal. 2011) (no standing where party “alleg[ed] [city] fined him for running a red light, \nbecause he does not have a legally protected interest to break the law by running red lights”).4 \n4.  Plaintiffs Are Not Within the Zone of Interests of Sections 1226 or 1357 \nPlaintiffs also lack a cognizable cause of action under zone-of-interests principles. To be \n“aggrieved” under the APA for purposes of the zone-of-interests analysis, “the interest sought to \nbe protected by the complainant [must] be arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or \nregulated by the statute . . . in question.” Clarke v. Sec. Indus. Ass’n, 479 U.S. 388, 396 (1987). The \nrelevant statutes here are 8 U.S.C. §§ 1226 and 1357, which govern ICE’s arrest authority and \naliens’ rights with respect to ICE arrests. Those statutes do not govern Plaintiffs’ conduct or actions \nin any way, and do not create any entitlement or interest that Plaintiffs may invoke. When Justice \nO’Connor confronted a similar challenge brought by “organizations that provide legal help to \nimmigrants,” she concluded that the relevant INA provisions were “clearly meant to protect the \ninterests of undocumented aliens, not the interests of [such] organizations,” and that the fact that a \n“regulation may affect the way an organization allocates its resources . . . does not give standing to \nan entity which is not within the zone of interests the statute meant to protect.”  INS v. Legalization \nAssistance Project, 510 U.S. 1301, 1302, 1305 (1993) (O’Connor, J., in chambers); see Fed’n for \nAm. Immigration Reform, Inc. v. Reno, 93 F.3d 897, 900–04 (D.C. Cir. 1996). Importantly, the INA \nprovides a process, led by immigration courts, for addressing detention issues, and also provides \nindividual aliens with a means to challenge their arrest and the initiation of removal proceedings, \n                                                           \n4 The Collaborative also lacks “associational standing” because “the claim asserted [and] the relief \nrequested require[] the participation of individual members in the lawsuit” given that their claims \nturn entirely on the application of the Directive to individual aliens who are not before the Court. \nSee Am. Postal Workers Union v. Frank, 968 F.2d 1373, 1375 (1st Cir. 1992).  \n11  \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 34   Filed 05/15/19   Page 13 of 29\nsee 8 U.S.C. § 1252, including a means to obtain review in the courts of appeals. But the INA \nprovides Plaintiffs with no right of action. Accordingly, Plaintiffs do not fall within the zone of \ninterests of the relevant statutes. \nB.  Plaintiffs Lack a Valid Cause of Action under the APA to Challenge ICE’s Arrest Policies. \nPlaintiffs also lack a cause of action under the APA, so this Court lacks any basis to enter \nan injunction on that claim.  \nFirst,  the  ICE  Directive  is  policy  guidance  implementing  prosecutorial  decisions \nconcerning when to institute enforcement actions, is therefore regarded as ‘committed to agency \ndiscretion’” under the APA, Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 192 (1993), and is thus not subject to \njudicial review. See 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2) (waiving sovereign immunity only if agency action is not \n“committed to agency discretion by law”). The “initiation or prosecution of various stages in the \ndeportation process,” including the choice of when to “commence” a proceeding, is a “regular” \nand longstanding example of an action that is committed to agency discretion. Reno v. Am.-Arab \nAnti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 483 (1999). Just as “the decision whether or not to \nprosecute”  presumptively  “rests  entirely  in  [the  prosecutor’s]  discretion,”  United  States  v. \nArmstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 464 (1996), an agency’s decision to bring a specific type of civil \nenforcement action or to invoke a specific enforcement provision—like 8 U.S.C. § 1226 or \n§ 1357—is generally immune from judicial scrutiny. See Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598, \n607-08 (1985) (“[T]he decision to prosecute is particularly ill-suited to judicial review”). Under \nthese principles, the Directive is unreviewable because it provides guidance to immigration \nofficers about how and when to exercise their discretion to arrest aliens who are properly subject \nto ICE’s detention authority. And even where prosecutorial-discretion decisions are formalized \nthrough  guidance  documents,  they  are  not  subject  to  review  if  the  ultimate  decision  is \n12  \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 34   Filed 05/15/19   Page 14 of 29\ndiscretionary. See, e.g., Morales de Soto v. Lynch, 824 F.3d 822, 828 (9th Cir. 2016). ICE’s \ndecisions concerning what categories of aliens to arrest and in what circumstances inherently \ninvolve the exercise of prosecutorial discretion, so Plaintiffs cannot obtain review of the Directive \nunder the APA.  \nSecond, “[t]he APA only provides for judicial review of ‘final agency action’ and … \nstatements of policy generally do not qualify because they are not finally determinative of the \nissues or rights to which [they are] addressed.” Am. Tort Reform Ass’n v. OSHA, 738 F.3d 387, 395 \n(D.C. Cir. 2013); see 5 U.S.C. § 704. The Directive “provides only internal ICE policy guidance,” \n“is not intended to, does not, and may not be relied upon to create any right or benefit, substantive \nor procedural,” and places “no limitations … on the otherwise lawful enforcement or litigative \nprerogatives of ICE.” Ex. A, ¶ 9. Because the Directive merely explains what ICE may do, and \ndoes not create substantive rules or rights, see Perez v. Mort. Bankers Ass’n, 135 S. Ct. 1199, 1204 \n(2015), or “bind” ICE officers, Broadgate Inc. v. USCIS, 730 F. Supp. 2d 240, 246 (D.D.C. 2010), \nit is unreviewable.5 \nC.  Plaintiffs’ APA Claim Is Not Likely to Succeed on the Merits. \nPlaintiffs’ APA claim also fails on the merits. The INA unambiguously authorizes ICE to \narrest any person who is in the United States in violation of immigration law and does not restrict \nthe  location  of  those  arrests.  There  is  no  federal-common-law  immunity  from  immigration \nenforcement for persons who are subject to ICE arrest. Plaintiffs’ central contention — that “[f]or \n                                                           \n5 To be sure, if the policy were applied to an actual alien, it may be final agency action as to that \nalien. See, e.g., Nat’l Min. Ass’n v. McCarthy, 758 F.3d 243, 253 (D.C. Cir. 2014). But that alien \ncould not challenge his arrest in federal court, and could only raise such claims in his removal \nproceedings. See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1252; Rajah v. Mukasey, 544 F.3d 427, 447 (2d Cir. 2008). \n13  \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 34   Filed 05/15/19   Page 15 of 29\nmore than two centuries, courts, including the Supreme Court and this Court, have strictly enforced \na well settled and absolute common-law privilege against civil arrest of those attending court on \nofficial business”—is simply incorrect. Mot. 1; see id. 3-4 (similar). And, even if an expansive \ncommon-law privilege existed, Congress has spoken clearly in establishing a uniform system of \nimmigration, which dictates when and where immigration arrests are lawful, thereby abrogating \nany such privilege. \n1.  There  Is  No  Common-Law  Privilege  Against  Federal  Immigration  Enforcement  in \nCourthouses. \nPlaintiffs propound a novel theory of federal common law. They attempt to analogize \nimmigration arrests—which concern the federal government’s plenary authority over immigration \nlaw—with civil arrests in private suits when one has entered a jurisdiction to which he is not \nnormally subject, which, in the modern context, has been superseded by immunity from service of \nprocess based on transient jurisdiction when attending court. See, e.g., Mot. 1, 1-7. They claim \nthat, because the federal-common-law immunity from civil arrests is “well-settled,” Congress in \nthe INA legislated against that background principle, id. at 13, and “invoke[d] a general common-\nlaw concept without specifying its precise scope.” Mot. 13. This argument fails because it is based \non two faulty premises about the nature of the privilege. \nFirst, Plaintiffs assert an overbroad privilege that finds no support in Supreme Court \nprecedent: a privilege against all civil arrests regardless of jurisdiction or arresting authority. The \nSupreme Court’s cases recognize a much narrower privilege: the immunity from service of process \nin a civil suit based on transient jurisdiction, when the only reason that a person is in the jurisdiction \nis to attend a court proceeding as a witness or party. See Lamb v. Schmitt, 285 U.S. 222, 225 (1932) \n(service on an Illinois resident when he was in the Northern District of Mississippi “in attendance \n14  \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 34   Filed 05/15/19   Page 16 of 29\non the court”); Page Co. v. MacDonald, 261 U.S. 446, 446-47 (1923) (service on a Canadian \nresident who was in Massachusetts “in attendance before a special master appointed by the \nsuperior court”); Stewart v. Ramsay, 242 U.S. 128, 129 (1916) (service on a Colorado resident \nwhen in the Northern District of Illinois solely as a witness in a case).6 As the Supreme Court \nmade clear in Stewart, “[t]he true rule, well founded in reason and sustained by the weight of \nauthority, is that suitors, as well as witnesses, coming from another state or jurisdiction, are exempt \nfrom the service of civil process while in attendance upon court, and during a reasonable time in \ncoming and going.” Stewart, 242 U.S. at 129 (emphasis added). Indeed, when a person is traveling \nto another state for court and is arrested by the federal government, a person cannot complain of \n“a violation of the rule of comity” when the arrest is from “the courts or the sovereignty which is \n[the] common superior.” Morse v. United States, 267 U.S. 80, 82 (1925). \nIn no case has the Supreme Court applied the rule so broadly as to encompass persons who, \neven if they were not attending a court proceeding, would otherwise be subject to arrest or service \nof process in the relevant jurisdiction. And in no case has the Supreme Court or any other court \nsuggested that this limited privilege would be applicable to immigration enforcement—where the \nUnited States clearly has authority to initiate process against the alien within the United States.  To \nthe contrary, the privilege applies only when a jurisdiction would otherwise lack authority over \nthe person but for their appearance in it to attend a court proceeding. The subjects of the privilege \nwould otherwise lawfully be able to avoid suit in the foreign jurisdiction by not entering that \njurisdiction. The privilege’s purpose is to “fill[] the gap only where it needs to be filled, that is, in \n                                                           \n6 Plaintiffs also cite dicta from Long v. Ansell, which addressed senators’ constitutional privilege \nfrom arrest.  293 U.S. 76 (1934), but that case merely cites Lamb and is factually irrelevant. Id. at \n83. \n15  \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 34   Filed 05/15/19   Page 17 of 29\ncases where a district court wishes to shield an individual from service of process to encourage his \nor her travel to the forum state.”7 N. Light Tech, 236 F.3d at 62 (emphasis added). Here, the alien \nis already in the jurisdiction that subjects him to immigration custody, so the rationale behind the \ncommon law rule has no applicability.   \nThe process-immunity privilege is also narrower than the “absolute” privilege Plaintiffs \nassert. They cite Page Co. to suggest that the privilege is “inflexible,” but that case did not go so \nfar. Mot. 4. The privilege is limited if it impinges the “due administration of justice,” Lamb. 285 \nU.S. at 227, and so “process immunity should be meted out sparingly.” N. Light Tech., 236 F.3d \nat 62. And “the public interest in apprehending” a person for violating immigration laws, like the \ninterest in prosecution, “outweighs the public interests … in encouraging vindication of private \nrights and in preventing the interruption of judicial proceedings.”8 Conley, 80 F. Supp. at 701-02.  \nService of process in private suits is entirely distinct from immigration enforcement, and \nPlaintiffs cite no case that applies that process immunity against federal immigration enforcement. \n                                                           \n7 Plaintiffs cite state common law, Mot. 6, but state common law has no application in federal \ncourt in a challenge to federal statutes because “federal courts may not use state common law to \nre-write a federal statute. Nachwalter v. Christie, 805 F.2d 956, 960 (11th Cir. 1986) (citing \nWorkers Union of America v. Lincoln Mills of Alabama, 353 U.S. 448, 456–57 (1957)). \n8 Plaintiffs rely on Larned v. Griffin, 12 F. 590 (D. Mass. 1882), which dealt with civil arrest. That \ncase involved transient jurisdiction of a person present in one state to attend depositions in another. \n12 F. at 590. The court used the phrase “absolute protection” to mean that the immunity covers \n“civil process,” rather than merely permitting “common bail.” Id. at 594. In doing so, the court \nrejected the “narrower view” that the privilege is “wholly the privilege of the court rather than of \nthe suitor.” Id. But the Supreme Court adopted the “narrower view” in Lamb. 285 U.S. at 225. \n16  \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 34   Filed 05/15/19   Page 18 of 29\nThe now-defunct privilege from extra-jurisdictional arrest involved arrests to initiate civil suits by \nprivate parties. Those private parties were not enforcing a public law and could not claim superior \nrights over the public interest. Meanwhile, “[t]he Government of the United States has broad, \nundoubted power over the subject of immigration and the status of aliens.” Arizona v. United \nStates, 567 U.S. 387, 394 (2012). “This authority rests, in part, on the National Government’s \nconstitutional power to ‘establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization.’” Id. (quoting Const. art. I, \n§ 8, cl. 4). “The federal power to determine immigration policy is well settled[,]” and “[a] principal \nfeature of the removal system is the broad discretion exercised by immigration officials.” Id. at \n396. That discretion—including arrest authority—is “plenary” and “pervasive,” and “is uniquely \na matter of federal, not local, concern.” Herrera-Inirio, 208 F.3d at 307. Accordingly,  a court’s \nauthority over an alien under its jurisdiction “and detention of a removable alien pursuant to the \nINA  are  separate  functions  that  serve  separate  purposes  and  are  performed  by  different \nauthorities.” United States v. Vasquez-Benitez, 919 F.3d 546, 552 (D.C. Cir. 2019). When ICE \ndetains an alien for the purpose of removal, it thus “does not infringe upon the judiciary’s role in \ncriminal proceedings.” Id. That reasoning applies to all instances of immigration detention for \npurposes of removal and to all types of judicial proceeding. See id; United States v. Veloz-Alonso, \n90 F.3d 266, 270 (6th Cir. 2018). \nSecond,  any  privilege  against  civil  arrest  was  superseded  by  the  process-immunity \nprivilege long before the codification of the current immigration scheme. By the time that Congress \nestablished the comprehensive immigration-arrest statutory scheme, any privilege against extra-\njurisdictional civil arrest was a mere historical artifact referenced in cases only to provide historical \ncontext for the modern process-immunity privilege. Plaintiffs cite no Supreme Court case that even \napplies the alleged privilege against civil arrest. See Mot. 3-7, 9-10. Indeed, Page Co. and Lamb \n17  \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 34   Filed 05/15/19   Page 19 of 29\ndo not even contain the word “arrest.” The only reference to “arrest” in the Supreme Court’s \ndecisions on the privilege comes in Stewart, a case from 1916. 242 U.S. at 130. The Court made \nthat reference in discussing a case from 1809, more than 200 years ago and already ancient when \nStewart was decided in 1916. Id. Thirty-six years after Stewart, when Congress first codified civil \nimmigration arrests, the privilege had been completely superseded by the process-immunity \nprivilege against transient jurisdiction. 8 U.S.C. § 1231 (enacted June 27, 1952). But a civil \nimmigration arrest is not “service of process.” Id. The arrest statutes cannot have codified the \npurported privilege, given that such a privilege had never been formally recognized by the \nSupreme Court, evidently had only ever been applied in federal court to bar a finding of transient \njurisdiction, apparently had never been applied to limit federal executive-branch law enforcement, \nand had long since been replaced with a privilege against service of process. \nPlaintiffs  do  not  argue—nor  can  they—that  aliens  are  not  subject  to  federal  law-\nenforcement jurisdiction anywhere within the United States’ borders. 9 See 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a) \n(providing for arrests “[o]n a warrant” without jurisdictional limitation), § 1357 (providing for \nwarrantless arrests without jurisdictional limitation). Neither can Plaintiffs argue that aliens have \na right to evade immigration enforcement. See E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, 909 F.3d \n1219, 1239 (no legally protected right to violate immigration law); 8 U.S.C. § 1226 (dictating \nwhen detention is required or optional), § 1231 (mandating detention of aliens with final removal \norders). And the principles of comity that undergird the service-of-process rules do not apply to \nthe federal law enforcement. Cf. Morse, 267 U.S. at 82. \n                                                           \n9 The Supreme Court has made clear that federal laws are the state’s: “When Congress, in the \nexertion of the power confided to it by the Constitution, adopted [an] act, it spoke for all the people \nand all the states, and thereby established a policy for all.” Testa v. Katt, 330 U.S. 386, 392 (1947). \n18  \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 34   Filed 05/15/19   Page 20 of 29\nBecause a broad privilege against immigration enforcement in courthouses did not exist \nwhen Congress codified the civil immigration arrest authority, this Court is foreclosed from \ncreating that rule now. “Federal courts, unlike state courts, are not general common-law courts and \ndo not possess a general power to develop and apply their own rules of decision.” City of \nMilwaukee v. Illinois & Michigan, 451 U.S. 304, 312 (1981). “The enactment of a federal rule in \nan area of national concern ...  is generally made not by the federal judiciary, purposefully insulated \nfrom democratic pressures, but by the people through their elected representatives in Congress.” \nId. Courts must “start with the assumption that it is for Congress, not the federal courts, to articulate \nthe appropriate standards to be applied as a matter of federal law.” Id. “Courts do not, of course, \nhave free rein to impose rules ... , as a matter of policy, when the interpretation of a statute is at \nhand.” Astoria Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass’n v. Solimino, 501 U.S. 104, 108 (1991). And, as the First \nCircuit  has  noted,  “[a]ccompanying  the  courts’  repeated  recognition  of  the  validity  of  the \nparty/witness immunity exception ... has been a persistent acknowledgement of the exception’s \nlimitations.” N. Light Tech., 236 F.3d at 62. The First Circuit stressed that Lamb explicitly dictates \nthat the “[process-immunity] privilege should not be enlarged beyond the reason upon which it is \nfounded.” Id. It emphasized that the privilege’s reason is to “fill[] the gap only where it needs to \nbe filled, that is, in cases where a district court wishes to shield an individual from service of \nprocess to encourage his or her travel to the forum state, but would be unable to do so absent the \npower to grant immunity.” Id. \nWithout any evidence of a privilege against immigration enforcement, Plaintiffs ask this \nCourt to adopt a policy measure under the guise of federal common law. Plaintiffs dictate their \nown terms about who should be privileged from arrest and who should not. See Mot. 20 (requesting \nan injunctions for all persons “attending court on official business”); id. 3 (not challenging arrests \n19  \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 34   Filed 05/15/19   Page 21 of 29\nof persons in state custody). Plaintiffs do not seek individualized determinations in individual \ncases, but rather a blanket injunction notwithstanding the judicial proscriptions against it, see infra, \nSection E. Plaintiffs recognize that ICE has made its own determination about when to pursue \ncourthouse arrests, limiting them only as to aliens who are top enforcement priorities, absent \nexceptional circumstances. Mot. 8-9. Plaintiffs disagree with that policy determination and seek to \nenjoin a policy that largely has been in place for years. See Ex. B. In essence, Plaintiffs ask this \nCourt to engage in lawmaking. This Court lacks the power to do so. See, e.g., Milwaukee, 451 U.S. \nat 312. Because there is no federal common law right to evade federal immigration enforcement, \nthis Court should deny Plaintiffs’ motion. \n2.  Congress Established a Comprehensive Immigration Detention Scheme that Supplants any \nPrior Common Law on Civil Immigration Enforcement. \nEven if a federal-common-law privilege against civil arrest existed in the unprecedented, \nbroad form that Plaintiffs claim, the federal statutory immigration scheme comprehensively speaks \nto how Congress intended the federal government to enforce federal immigration law, thus \nsupplanting any prior federal common law on the issue. In determining whether a statutory scheme \ndisplaces federal common law, courts do not examine a single statute in isolation, but rather \nconsider the entire statutory scheme. See, e.g., Am. Elec. Power Co. v. Connecticut, 564 U.S. 410, \n424 (2011). If federal common law applies on an issue, the “question” in determining whether \nCongress meant to displace the common law is “whether the legislative scheme spoke directly to \na question.” Milwaukee, 451 U.S. at 315-17 (internal quotation marks omitted); see Texas, 507 \nU.S. at 534 (similar). “This interpretive presumption is not . . . one that entails a requirement of \nclear statement, to the effect that Congress must state precisely the intention to overcome the \npresumption’s application to a given statutory scheme.” Astoria, 501 U.S. at 108. That question is \n20  \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 34   Filed 05/15/19   Page 22 of 29\ndifferent from, and less strict than, that which applies when determining preemption because “the \nStates are represented in Congress but not in the federal courts.” Milwaukee, 451 U.S. at 316. No \n“clear and manifest congressional purpose” to displace federal common law is required. Am. Elec. \nPower Co., 564 U.S. at 423.  \nThe congressional scheme shows that Congress spoke to the issue of immigration arrests, \nthus displacing any federal common law. The federal immigration scheme is a “comprehensive \nand unified system” maintained by a “single sovereign.” Id. at 401. As the Supreme Court has \nstressed, “[t]he federal statutory structure instructs when it is appropriate to arrest an alien during \nthe removal process.” Id. at 407. “‘The authority to control immigration—to admit or exclude \naliens—is vested solely in the Federal Government.’” Id. at 409-10 (quoting Truax v. Raich, 239 \nU.S. 33, 42 (1915)); see infra 13. Any state attempt to alter Congress’ comprehensive removal \nscheme  “creates  an  obstacle  to  the  full  purposes  and  objectives  of  Congress”  and  is  thus \n“preempted by federal law.”10 Id. at 411.  \nBecause the federal government has the sole authority over immigration, it has regulatory \nauthority over all aliens within the United States. Cf. Buckman Co. v. Plaintiffs’ Legal Comm., 531 \nU.S. 341, 347 (2001) (“[T]he relationship between a federal agency and the entity it regulates is \ninherently federal in character because the relationship originates from, is governed by, and \nterminates according to federal law.”). Congress thus has the power to create a system that permits \narrests of aliens notwithstanding the status of federal or state court proceedings. See Herrera-\n                                                           \n10 Congress has occupied the field of federal immigration arrest authority, so Plaintiffs cannot rest \non state common law in the absence of federal common law; nor could state courts prohibit the \nfederal government from acting. In re Tarble, 80 U.S. 397 (1871); M'Culloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. \n316, 436 (1819). \n21  \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 34   Filed 05/15/19   Page 23 of 29\nInirio, 208 F.3d at 307-08 (“[I]n areas in which plenary federal power exists, ‘the Supremacy \nClause permits no other result,’ notwithstanding that Congress may enact laws that ‘curtail or \nprohibit the States’ prerogatives to make legislative choices respecting subjects the States may \nconsider important.’”) (quoting Hodel v. Va. Surface Mining & Reclamation Ass’n, 452 U.S. 264, \n290 (1981)); cf. Vasquez-Benitez, 919 F.3d at 548 (ICE may arrest alien even while criminal \nproceedings are pending and after a judge orders release on bond).  \nCongress has done just that: ICE may arrest all aliens except aliens who are in state criminal \ncustody serving a criminal sentence. The INA provides a comprehensive scheme governing DHS \narrests of aliens. Under 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a), “on a warrant issued” by DHS attesting to an alien’s \nremovability,  “an  alien  may  be  arrested  and  detained”  during  the  pendency  of  removal \nproceedings, and the Secretary’s “discretionary judgment regarding the application of this section \nshall not be subject to review.” Id. § 1226(e). Under 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(2), DHS “shall detain the \nalien.” Certain aliens, including ones who are a “risk to the community or unlikely to comply with \nthe order of removal, may be detained beyond the removal period.” 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(6). The \nrelevant statutes set only one limitation on DHS’s broad detention authority: the INA, mindful of \n“cooperative federalism” concerns, limits DHS’s authority to take into custody an alien who is \ncurrently serving a criminal sentence, requiring DHS to await the completion of the alien’s \ncriminal imprisonment. 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c); see 8 U.S.C. § 1231. A fortiori, there is not a non-\ntextual, unwritten limit on arrest authority for aliens in the vicinity of state courthouses. Instead, \nCongress has authorized DHS to detain removable aliens whenever they are released from state \nimprisonment “without regard to whether the alien is released on parole, supervised release, or \nprobation, and without regard to whether the alien may be arrested or imprisoned again for the \n22  \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 34   Filed 05/15/19   Page 24 of 29\nsame offense.” 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c). When DHS arrests an alien on a warrant, the statute imposes \nno limitations on that authority. Id. § 1226(a).  \nSo, too, Congress was explicit when it delineated limitations on DHS’s warrantless arrest \nauthority. Under 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(2), Congress gave immigration officers broad authority “to \narrest any alien in the United States” without a warrant if they “have reason to believe that the \nalien so arrested is in the United States in violation” of “any law or regulation made in pursuance \nof law regulating the admission, exclusion, expulsion, or removal of aliens” and “is likely to escape \nbefore a warrant can be obtained for his arrest.” Congress provided even broader arrest authority \nwithin a “reasonable distance from any external boundary of the United States” to “board and \nsearch for aliens any vessel within the territorial waters of the United States and any railway car, \naircraft, conveyance or vehicle.” Id. § 1357(a)(3). When Congress wanted to restrict immigration \nofficers’ powers, it did so explicitly, authorizing “access to private lands” within “twenty-five \nmiles” of the border, but limiting access to “dwellings” and restricting warrantless entry to “the \npremises of a farm or other outdoor agricultural operation.” Id. § 1357(a)(3), (e). These provisions \nshow Congress knew how to limit DHS’s arrest authority and made conscious—but limited—\nchoices about when to do so. Because Congress specifically delineated DHS’s immigration-arrest \nauthority and authorized arrests by warrant without limitation, any federal-common-law privilege \nfrom arrest, even if it existed, would have been overridden by the congressional scheme. See, e.g., \nAm. Elec. Power Co., 564 U.S. at 424. \n3.  Courthouse Arrests Do Not Raise Constitutional Concerns. \nPlaintiffs argue that ICE’s statutory arrest authority should be interpreted in a way that \navoids constitutional concerns. But the canon of constitutional avoidance comes into play only \nwhen a statute is ambiguous. Jennings v. Rodriguez, 138 S. Ct. 830, 842 (2018). Sections 1226(a) \n23  \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 34   Filed 05/15/19   Page 25 of 29\nand 1357(a)(2) unambiguously authorize ICE to arrest aliens without any limitation relevant here, \nso it does not apply. Even if § 1226(a) or 1357(a)(2) were ambiguous, courthouse arrests do not \nraise the concerns Plaintiffs allege under the Tenth Amendment or the right of access to the courts. \nMot. 14-17. \nTenth Amendment. Plaintiffs vaguely assert that the ICE Directive cannot “commandeer \nthe state criminal justice and judiciary systems,” Compl. ¶ 115; see Mot. 16. Under the Tenth \nAmendment, “the Federal Government may not compel the States to implement, by legislation or \nexecutive action, federal regulatory programs.” Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 925 (1997). \nPut another way, the Tenth Amendment prohibits the federal government from “commandeering” \nstate  executive  or  legislative  actors.  Id.  The  ICE  Directive  does  not  implicate  the  Tenth \nAmendment because it does not command or compel state actors to take any action at all. \nMassachusetts “courthouses are public spaces that are open to all persons,” including “DHS \nemployees.”  Mass.  Executive  Office  of  the  Trial  Court,  Policy  and  Procedures  Regarding \nCourthouse Interactions with the Department of Homeland Security (Nov. 8, 2017). ICE officers \ncan freely  enter State courthouses without the  consent or  cooperation  of State actors.  ICE \ncourthouse arrests do not require any action by state officers and nothing in the Directive compels \nemployees of the state criminal justice or judiciary systems to take action or refrain from taking \naction at all. So the Directive raises no Tenth Amendment issues.11 See Murphy v. NCAA, 138 \nS.Ct. 1461, 1482 (May 14, 2018).  \n \n                                                           \n11 Even were that not so, “[w]hen the state judiciary enforces federal law … as the Supremacy \nClause requires it to do … [t]here is no ‘commandeering’ of the State’s resources where the State \nis asked to do no more than enforce federal law.” Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 801 n.34 (1999). \n24  \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 34   Filed 05/15/19   Page 26 of 29\nRight of Access to the Courts. The right of access to the courts prohibits “systemic official \naction [that] frustrates a plaintiff or plaintiff class in preparing and filing suits.” Christopher v. \nHarbury, 536 U.S. 403, 413 (2002). Although the Constitution guarantees the right “to bring to \ncourt a grievance,” the Supreme Court has explicitly disclaimed the existence of a constitutional \nright “to litigate effectively once in court.” Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 354 (1996) (emphasis in \noriginal). \nThe Collaborative alleges that the Directive violates its members’ right of access because \nthe Directive “forc[es] noncitizens potentially subject to removal to risk civil arrest to access the \ncourts.” Compl. ¶ 121. But the possibility that an unlawful alien will be arrested in a state \ncourthouse does not limit his ability to prepare or file a lawsuit. Notwithstanding the Directive, an \nunlawful alien is free “to bring to court a grievance,” which is the only process that the right of \naccess guarantees. Lewis, 518 U.S. at 354. And to the extent that the Directive discourages aliens \nfrom attending court proceedings, that effect is irrelevant to the constitutional inquiry, given that \nlitigants lack any right to litigate effectively once in court. Id. Indeed, the Collaborative seeks to \nextend the right of access beyond its limited scope. If Plaintiffs’ theory was correct, any federal \nlaw authorizing criminal or civil enforcement would be unconstitutional because each such law \ncreates a disincentive for some subset of the populace to attend court proceedings. Because the \nDirective does not prevent unlawful aliens from preparing or filing grievances, it does not \nimplicate the right of access to the courts. \nD.  The Other Preliminary-Injunction Factors Weigh in Defendants’ Favor. \nPlaintiffs also cannot show that they are “likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence \nof preliminary relief,” that the “balance of equities” tips in their favor, or than an injunction is “in \nthe public interest.” Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). Plaintiffs allege \n25  \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 34   Filed 05/15/19   Page 27 of 29\nthat they would suffer “financial harm” and “ha[ve] to divert significant resources responding to \n[the] Directive.”  Mot. 17–18.  But these alleged harms pale in comparison to the harms that the \npublic and the federal government would suffer if ICE was unable to arrest fugitive aliens at the \none place at which it can reliably find them in Massachusetts. See ICE, FAQ on Sensitive Locations \nand Courthouse Arrests, ECF No. 1-3 The federal government and the public have a strong interest \nin “law enforcement and public safety,” Maryland v. King, 133 S. Ct. 1, 3 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., \nin chambers); see Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009), and “it must weigh heavily in the \nbalance that control over matters of immigration is a sovereign prerogative,” Landon v. Plasencia, \n459 U.S. 21, 34 (1982).  Whereas Plaintiffs’ alleged “money, time and energy” harms carry little \nweight, Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 90 (1974), the government and the public have a \n“pressing” interest in the enforcement of federal law.  United States v. Ven-Fuel, Inc., 758 F.2d \n741,  761  (1st  Cir.  1985),  especially  when  Plaintiffs  themselves  are  not  the  subject  of  the \nimmigration enforcement they seek to thwart. \nE.  Plaintiffs Seek an Overbroad Injunction. \nEven if Plaintiffs were likely to satisfy the preliminary injunctive factors, they would not \nbe entitled to injunctive relief, given that they have only moved for an injunction on their APA \nclaim. The normal remedy in an APA case is to “set aside” the agency action.  But Plaintiffs ask \nfor much more: an injunction preventing ICE from “arresting individuals attending court on \nofficial business.” That is far beyond any permissible relief where they only seek relief based on \ntheir APA claim. And even were Plaintiffs somehow entitled to declaratory and injunctive relief, \nthey would not entitled to an order enjoining the Directive of ICE arrest authority in full. Under \nArticle III, “[a] plaintiff’s remedy must be tailored to redress the plaintiff’s particular injury.” Gill \nv. Whitford, 138 S. Ct. 1916, 1934 (2018). Thus, even if Plaintiffs could seek relief on behalf of \n26  \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-IT   Document 34   Filed 05/15/19   Page 28 of 29\nthird parties or the tangential effects on Plaintiffs of ICE actions towards those parties, any relief \nmust be tailored to remedying the Plaintiffs’ putative harms in cases before the state courts in \nMiddlesex and Suffolk Counties, and must be limited to specific aliens who seek to  avail \nthemselves of the privilege. See, e.g., Langlois v. Abington Housing Authority, 207 F.3d 43, 49 \n(1st Cir. 2000); see City & Cty. of San Francisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1244–45 (9th Cir. \n2018) (reversing nationwide injunction where plaintiffs’ “tendered evidence [was] limited to the \neffect of the” challenged conduct on them alone). Anything more violates the principle that an \ninjunction should “be no more burdensome to the defendant than necessary to provide complete \nrelief to the plaintiffs.” Madsen v. Women’s Health Ctr., Inc., 512 U.S. 753, 765 (1994). \nCONCLUSION \nFor these reasons, this Court should deny Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction. \n// \n// \nDated: May 20, 2019         Respectfully submitted, \nJOSEPH H.

Believing state courthouses to be appropriate locations in which to conduct civil\nenforcement actions, ICE increased its efforts to arrest allegedly removable noncitizens in\nand around state courthouses when they appeared for judicial proceedings. In January of\n\n2018, ICE issued Directive 11072.1 (the Directive), formalizing its policy regarding civil\nenforcement actions in such courthouses.\nICE's growing presence in Massachusetts courthouses concerned a number of persons and\norganizations, including Marian Ryan and Rachael Rollins (the District Attorneys of\nMiddlesex County and\n15\n*15 Suffolk County, respectively), the Committee for Public Counsel Services (the main\npublic defender agency for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts), and Chelsea\nCollaborative, Inc. (a nonprofit that provides services to the immigrant community in\nChelsea, Massachusetts). Fearing the effects of ICE's activities on the proper functioning of\nboth the state judicial system and access to justice in immigrant communities, they sued\nICE, the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and three DHS officials\n(collectively, the defendants), specifically challenging the Directive and generally\nchallenging ICE's policy of civilly arresting individuals attending court on official business.[1]\nWhen the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction, they argued primarily that ICE lacked\nstatutory authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101-1537,\nto conduct such arrests because the INA implicitly incorporates a hoary common law\nprivilege against civil arrests for parties and witnesses attending court proceedings. The\ndistrict court determined that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of this\nargument and preliminarily enjoined ICE from implementing the Directive or otherwise civilly\narresting individuals attending court on official business anywhere in Massachusetts. See\nRyan v. U.S. Immigr. & Customs Enf't, 382 F. Supp. 3d 142, 159, 161 (D. Mass. 2019).[2] On\nthis interlocutory appeal, we have carefully considered the district court's rescript and the\ncompendious briefing furnished by both the parties and an array of helpful amici. We\nconclude that the district court abused its discretion in finding that the plaintiffs were likely to\nsucceed on the merits of their argument that the INA implicitly incorporates a common law\nprivilege against civil arrests for individuals attending court on official business. Turning to\nthe plaintiffs' backup argument, we likewise conclude that, on the underdeveloped record\nbefore us, the plaintiffs have so far failed to show that they are likely to succeed in arguing\nthat ICE lacks statutory authority to conduct such arrests in Massachusetts because\nCongress has not clearly stated its intent to permit arrests that violate state law.\nConsequently, we vacate the preliminary injunction and remand for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\nI. BACKGROUND\nWe briefly rehearse the relevant facts and travel of the case. For some time, ICE has\nconducted civil enforcement actions designed to take removable noncitizens into custody in\ncourthouses across the country. During the Obama administration, ICE imposed certain\n\nrestrictions on the ability of its officers to conduct such actions in courthouses. In March of\n2014, ICE issued guidance directing that \"[e]nforcement actions at or near courthouses will\nonly be undertaken against Priority 1 aliens.\" An earlier ICE policy, which remained in effect,\ndefined \"Priority 1\n16\n*16 aliens\" as those posing a threat to national security or public safety. The 2014 guidance\nalso forbade ICE officers from arresting \"collateral\" noncitizens whom they encounter during\nan enforcement action against a Priority 1 target, such as family members or friends\naccompanying the target to a court appearance.\nICE's enforcement priorities changed when the political winds shifted. Shortly after taking\noffice, President Trump issued an executive order (the EO) on January 25, 2017, declaring\nthe federal government's intention to \"[e]nsure the faithful execution of the immigration laws\n... against all removable aliens.\" Exec. Order No. 13,768, 3 C.F.R., 2017 Comp., p. 268,\nreprinted in 8 U.S.C. § 1103 app. at 647-49 (2018). To this end, the EO expanded the\nclasses of noncitizens prioritized for removal. See id. at 269. A month later, the Secretary of\nDHS handed down a memorandum implementing the EO and rescinding any conflicting\ndirectives or guidance. This memorandum reiterated the broader enforcement priorities\ndelineated in the EO.\nNeither the EO nor the implementing memorandum directly addressed courthouse arrests.\nIt nonetheless appears that ICE officers began to conduct more civil arrests in and around\nstate courthouses, including those in Massachusetts. ICE attributes this change to a\nnewfound unwillingness on the part of many state and local governments to honor civil\nimmigration detainers, which ask law enforcement agencies to hold allegedly removable\nnoncitizens beyond their scheduled release from criminal custody so that federal\nimmigration officers may detain them. See City of Providence v. Barr, 954 F.3d 23, 29 (1st\nCir. 2020). Such an unwillingness was antithetic to ICE's claim that courthouses were the\nsafest place to arrest such noncitizens because courthouse visitors are customarily\nscreened for weapons upon their arrival. In Massachusetts, the situation took on a new\ndimension when the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) held that state-court\nfunctionaries could not detain noncitizens based solely on civil immigration detainers. See\nLunn v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 517, 78 N.E.3d 1143, 1146 (2017) (per curiam).\nThe Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Trial Court, in response to Lunn and ICE's more\npervasive presence in Massachusetts courthouses, promulgated a policy for state-court\npersonnel regarding civil immigration enforcement actions in state courthouses. This policy\ntook effect in November of 2017. Under it, ICE officers \"may enter a courthouse and\nperform their official duties provided that their conduct in no way disrupts or delays court\noperations, or compromises court safety or decorum.\" The policy directs state-court\npersonnel to ask any armed ICE officer seeking entry into a courthouse to state his\nlaw-enforcement purpose and to describe the enforcement action that he proposes to\n\nundertake. If an ICE officer attempts to effect a civil arrest of a noncitizen who is not in the\ncourt's custody, the policy instructs state-court personnel neither to impede nor to assist\nwith the arrest. ICE officers may not conduct civil arrests either in nonpublic spaces within a\ncourthouse or (absent permission in advance) in courtrooms.\nIn January of 2018, ICE issued the Directive, codifying its policy anent civil enforcement\nactions in courthouses. The Directive enlarged the categories of noncitizens subject to civil\narrest in courthouses beyond those specified in the agency's 2014 guidance. Specifically,\nICE officers were authorized to target noncitizens \"who have been ordered removed from\nthe United States but have failed to depart\" and those \"who have re-entered\n17\n*17 the country illegally after being removed.\" What is more, the Directive relaxed the\nrestriction on arresting \"collateral\" noncitizens present during an enforcement action: it\nauthorized ICE officers to arrest such an individual under \"special circumstances, such as\nwhere [he or she] poses a threat to public safety or interferes with ICE's enforcement\nactions.\" Although the Directive instructed ICE officers to \"generally avoid enforcement\nactions in courthouses, or areas within courthouses that are dedicated to non-criminal ...\nproceedings,\" it allowed such actions when \"operationally necessary.\"[3]\nAs ICE started to conduct more civil enforcement actions in courthouses across\nMassachusetts, the plaintiffs' concerns mounted. In their view, the specter of courthouse\narrest deters noncitizens from appearing in court (whether as criminal defendants, victims of\ncrimes, parties to civil litigation, or witnesses). This deterrent effect, they say, interferes with\nthe ability of prosecutors and defense counsel to resolve criminal charges and the ability of\nnoncitizens to enforce their legal rights in noncriminal areas ranging from domestic violence\nto employment.\nSpurred by these concerns, the plaintiffs filed suit in the United States District Court for the\nDistrict of Massachusetts. At the same time, they moved for preliminary injunctive relief with\nrespect to the first count of their complaint, which alleged that the Directive exceeds ICE's\nstatutory authority and, thus, violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). See 5 U.S.C.\n§ 706(2)(C). In support, they argued chiefly that the Directive exceeds ICE's statutory\nauthority because the civil arrest power in the INA implicitly incorporates a common law\nprivilege protecting against the civil arrest of individuals attending court on official business.\nAfter a two-day hearing at which no witnesses were called, the district court granted the\nplaintiffs' motion. See Ryan, 382 F. Supp. 3d at 161. To begin, the court found that the\nplaintiffs had both constitutional and prudential standing to bring their APA challenge to the\nlegality of the Directive.[4] See id. at 152-55. Next, the court found that the plaintiffs were\nlikely to succeed in showing that the Directive exceeds ICE's statutory authority. See id. at\n155-59. Finally, the court found that the remaining factors in the preliminary injunction\ncalculus favored the plaintiffs. See id. at 159-61. Summing up, the court preliminarily\n\n18\n*18 enjoined the defendants \"from implementing [the Directive] in Massachusetts and from\ncivilly arresting parties, witnesses, and others attending Massachusetts courthouses on\nofficial business while they are going to, attending, or leaving the courthouse.\" See id. at\n161.\nThis interlocutory appeal followed. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1).\nII. ANALYSIS\nWe have erected a four-part framework for district courts to use in determining whether to\ngrant or deny a preliminary injunction. Under this framework, a district court is tasked with\nconsidering the movant's likelihood of success on the merits; whether and to what extent\nthe movant will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary injunctive relief; the\nbalance of relative hardships, that is, the hardship to the nonmovant if enjoined as opposed\nto the hardship to the movant if no injunction issues; and the effect, if any, that either a\npreliminary injunction or the absence of one will have on the public interest. See Corp.\nTechs., Inc. v. Harnett, 731 F.3d 6, 9 (1st Cir. 2013); Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v.\nBaccarat, Inc., 102 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 1996).\nThe movant's likelihood of success on the merits weighs most heavily in the preliminary\ninjunction calculus. See Ross-Simons, 102 F.3d at 16. Indeed, we have described likelihood\nof success as the \"sine qua non\" of preliminary injunctive relief. New Comm Wireless\nServs., Inc. v. SprintCom, Inc., 287 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2002). If the movant \"cannot\ndemonstrate that he is likely to succeed in his quest, the remaining factors become matters\nof idle curiosity.\" Id.\nThere is, of course, an important distinction between a decision at the preliminary injunction\nstage and a final decision on the merits. Battles over preliminary injunctions normally are\nwaged early in a case. At such an embryonic stage in the litigation, an inquiring court need\nnot conclusively determine the merits of the movant's claim; it is enough for the court simply\nto evaluate the likelihood vel non that the movant ultimately will prevail on the merits. See\nRoss-Simons, 102 F.3d at 16.\nWe assay a district court's decision to grant or deny a preliminary injunction for abuse of\ndiscretion. See Corp. Techs., 731 F.3d at 10. Within this rubric, we examine answers to\nabstract legal questions de novo, findings of fact for clear error, and any judgment calls\nconcerning the balancing of the four factors with significant deference to the district court.\nSee id.; Ross-Simons, 102 F.3d at 16. A district court may be held to have abused its\ndiscretion by, say, making a material error of law, \"ignor[ing] pertinent elements deserving\nsignificant weight, consider[ing] improper criteria, or, though assessing all appropriate and\n\nno inappropriate factors, plainly err[ing] in balancing them.\" Ross-Simons, 102 F.3d at 16;\nsee Corp. Techs., 731 F.3d at 10.\nThe parties' briefs leave no doubt that they hold diametrically opposite positions on whether\nit is good public policy for ICE to arrest noncitizens in courthouses. In the plaintiffs' view,\nthese arrests undermine access to justice in immigrant communities and interfere with the\ntimely resolution of criminal prosecutions. In the defendants' view, the game is worth the\ncandle: they insist that courthouses provide a safe location for arresting noncitizens who\npose a threat to public safety.\nIt is not for us to say whether ICE's strategy is sound public policy or, conversely, whether\nthat strategy is antithetic to sound public policy. That question lies\n19\n*19 within the domain of the politically accountable branches of the federal and state\ngovernments. Our task is simply to decide the pertinent legal issues and determine whether\nthe district court abused its discretion in granting the preliminary injunction.\nA.\nOur starting point is the plaintiffs' likelihood of success on the merits. In support of their\nassertion that they are likely to succeed on their APA claim, the plaintiffs renew the principal\nargument that they advanced below: that the Directive and ICE's policy of civilly arresting\nindividuals attending court on official business exceed ICE's statutory authority under the\nINA. Importantly, they do not challenge the power of ICE officers to conduct criminal arrests\nin and around courthouses. See 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(4)-(5) (permitting ICE officers to make\nwarrantless arrests for certain federal crimes). Nor do they challenge ICE's authority to\nmake civil arrests of noncitizens brought to courthouses in either state or federal custody.\nInstead, their argument focuses exclusively on ICE's lack of any authority to civilly arrest\nindividuals who travel to courthouses on their own to attend court on official business. For\nease in exposition, we henceforth refer to this type of arrest as a \"courthouse arrest.\"\nThe plaintiffs' argument presents a pure question of law, which we review de novo. See\nCorp. Techs., 731 F.3d at 10. It is a bedrock principle that the power of an executive agency\nadministering a federal statute \"is `authoritatively prescribed by Congress.'\" City of\nProvidence, 954 F.3d at 31 (quoting City of Arlington v. FCC, 569 U.S. 290, 297, 133 S.Ct.\n1863, 185 L.Ed.2d 941 (2013)). When an agency acts in a manner not authorized by\nstatute, its action is ultra vires and a violation of the APA. See id.; see also 5 U.S.C. §\n706(2)(C).\nSo viewed, the plaintiffs' argument concerning the scope of ICE's civil arrest authority under\nthe INA reduces to a question of statutory construction. As with any effort to decipher the\n\nmeaning of a federal statute, the touchstone of this inquiry is congressional intent. See City\nof Providence, 954 F.3d at 31. And it is nose-on-the-face plain that \"the quest to determine\nthis intent must start with the text of the statute itself.\" Id.\nThe text of the INA confers broad authority upon ICE to conduct civil arrests. Under 8\nU.S.C. § 1226(a), an ICE officer may arrest a noncitizen pursuant to an administrative\nwarrant and may detain him during the pendency of removal proceedings. An interlocking\nINA provision, 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(2), authorizes the warrantless arrest of a noncitizen if an\nICE officer has reason to believe that the noncitizen is in the United States unlawfully and is\nlikely to escape before he can obtain a warrant. On their face, neither of these provisions\nbars ICE officers from exercising their civil arrest power either in courthouses or against\nindividuals attending court on official business. Nor do the plaintiffs identify an explicit\nlimitation to this effect anywhere else in the text of the INA.\nRecognizing that the INA does not prohibit courthouse arrests in haec verba, the plaintiffs'\nprimary theory invokes what has been called the \"nonderogation canon\" of statutory\nconstruction. Pasquantino v. United States, 544 U.S. 349, 359, 125 S.Ct. 1766, 161 L.Ed.2d\n619 (2005). They contend that there is a long-standing common law privilege against civil\ncourthouse arrests. Given this privilege, they add, we must presume that Congress\nintended not to permit courthouse arrests when it authorized\n20\n*20 civil arrests in the INA. To cap the matter, they submit that nothing in the text of the INA\nrebuts the presumption that Congress intended to incorporate this common law privilege,\nalbeit sub silentio, into the statute.\nThe nonderogation canon instructs that \"[s]tatutes which invade the common law ... are to\nbe read with a presumption favoring the retention of long-established and familiar principles,\nexcept when a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident.\" Id. (alterations in original)\n(quoting United States v. Texas, 507 U.S. 529, 534, 113 S.Ct. 1631, 123 L.Ed.2d 245\n(1993)). This instruction is rooted in the notion that when Congress legislates in an area\npermeated by such principles, it \"does not write upon a clean slate.\" Texas, 507 U.S. at 534,\n113 S.Ct. 1631. Consequently, a court must assume that Congress is aware of such\nlong-established and familiar principles and — in the absence of an evident statutory\npurpose to the contrary — intends to retain them. See Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. Static Control\nComponents, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 132, 134 S.Ct. 1377, 188 L.Ed.2d 392 (2014); Samantar v.\nYousuf, 560 U.S. 305, 320 n.13, 130 S.Ct. 2278, 176 L.Ed.2d 1047 (2010). Properly\nenvisioned, the nonderogation canon is just a tool to assist in discerning congressional\nintent, which remains the lodestar of the judicial inquiry into statutory meaning. See\nPasquantino, 544 U.S. at 360, 125 S.Ct. 1766; Astoria Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. Solimino,\n501 U.S. 104, 108, 111 S.Ct. 2166, 115 L.Ed.2d 96 (1991); cf. Scheidler v. Nat'l Org. for\nWomen, Inc., 547 U.S. 9, 23, 126 S.Ct. 1264, 164 L.Ed.2d 10 (2006) (explaining that\n\n\"canons of interpretation ... are tools designed to help courts better determine what\nCongress intended\").\nAlthough we do not question the continuing vitality of the nonderogation canon, we are less\nsanguine about its applicability in the circumstances of this case. After all, the\nnonderogation canon does not give courts carte blanche to read a grab bag of common law\nrules into federal statutes simply to effectuate what those courts may perceive as good\npolicy. See Astoria, 501 U.S. at 108, 111 S.Ct. 2166. It follows that a court should apply the\npresumption that Congress intended to retain a common law rule only if that rule was\n\"long-established and familiar\" at the time of the statute's enactment. Pasquantino, 544 U.S.\nat 359-60, 125 S.Ct. 1766 (quoting Texas, 507 U.S. at 534, 113 S.Ct. 1631). In other words,\nthe nonderogation canon comes into play only if the terms of a statute appear to disregard a\ncommon law rule that was both long-established and familiar when Congress enacted the\nstatute. See id.; United States v. Craft, 535 U.S. 274, 288, 122 S.Ct. 1414, 152 L.Ed.2d 437\n(2002). This requirement ensures that the assumption that Congress was aware of a\nparticular rule and, through its silence, intended to retain it is a reasonable one. See\nPasquantino, 544 U.S. at 359, 125 S.Ct. 1766; Astoria, 501 U.S. at 108, 111 S.Ct. 2166.\nAgainst this backdrop, we train the lens of our inquiry on the INA. Congress enacted the\nprovisions that authorize civil immigration arrests — 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a) and 8 U.S.C. §\n1357(a)(2) — in 1952. See Immigration and Nationality Act, Pub. L. No. 82-414, §§ 242(a),\n287(a)(2), 66 Stat. 163, 208-09, 233 (1952). Although Congress revised the wording of\nthese provisions in 1996, it did not alter the substantive authority that they conferred. See\nIllegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-208,\n§§ 303(a), 308(d)(4)(L)(i), 110 Stat. 3009-546, 3009-585, 3009-618. Because the substance\nof these statutory provisions dates back to 1952, we must examine the state of the common\nlaw as of that time to\n21\n*21 determine whether there was a long-established and familiar common law rule relating\nto courthouse arrests, which a court could presume Congress meant to incorporate into the\nINA. See Pasquantino, 544 U.S. at 360, 125 S.Ct. 1766.\nThe plaintiffs purport to locate such a rule in the common law privilege against courthouse\narrests for parties and witnesses to a civil suit. For the most part, the origins of this privilege\nare uncontroversial. At common law, a plaintiff in a civil action obtained personal jurisdiction\nover a defendant by means of a writ of capias ad respondendum. See Murphy Bros. v.\nMichetti Pipe Stringing, Inc., 526 U.S. 344, 350, 119 S.Ct. 1322, 143 L.Ed.2d 448 (1999).\nThis writ \"directed the sheriff to secure the defendant's appearance by taking him into\ncustody.\" Id. The common law also recognized other types of arrests in civil suits. The writ\nof capias ad satisfaciendum, for example, was a method of executing on a civil judgment\nthat directed the arrest of the judgment debtor. See Magniac v. Thomson, 56 U.S. (15 How.)\n281, 300, 14 L.Ed. 696 (1853).\n\nEnglish courts in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries protected parties and\nwitnesses attending court from at least some of these forms of civil arrest. See, e.g., Ex\nparte Byne, (1813) 35 Eng. Rep. 123, 123, 126 (Ch.); Walpole v. Alexander, (1782) 99 Eng.\nRep. 530, 531 (K.B.). This protection — which the plaintiffs refer to as a \"privilege\" — was\ndesigned both to remove a disincentive for inhibiting parties and witnesses from coming\nforward (especially the risk of arrest in connection with another matter) and to ensure that\narrests did not disrupt the orderly operation of the courts. See Orchard's Case, (1828) 38\nEng. Rep. 987, 987 (Ch.); Walpole, 99 Eng. Rep. at 531. To effectuate these dual purposes,\nthe protection extended not only to residents of England but also to foreigners entering the\ncountry for the purpose of attending court. See Walpole, 99 Eng. Rep. at 531.\nThe protective carapace sheltered such individuals while they were physically present in the\ncourthouse and while traveling to and from court. See Spence v. Stuart, (1802) 102 Eng.\nRep. 530, 531 (K.B.); Meekins v. Smith, (1791) 126 Eng. Rep. 363, 363 (C.P.); Walpole, 99\nEng. Rep. at 531. And it applied regardless of whether the individual attended court\nvoluntarily or under subpoena. See Meekins, 126 Eng. Rep. at 363. As William Blackstone\n— \"whose works constituted the preeminent authority on English law for the founding\ngeneration,\" Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 715, 119 S.Ct. 2240, 144 L.Ed.2d 636 (1999) —\nsummarized in his Commentaries on the Laws of England,\nSuitors, witnesses, and other persons, necessarily attending any courts of record upon\nbusiness, are not to be arrested during their actual attendance, which includes their\nnecessary coming and returning. And no arrest can be made in the king's presence, nor\nwithin the verge of his royal palace, nor in any place where the king's justices are actually\nsitting.\n3 William Blackstone, Commentaries *289 (emphasis in original).\nThis privilege survived an ocean crossing. \"[A]rrests in civil suits were still common in\nAmerica\" at the time of the founding, Long v. Ansell, 293 U.S. 76, 83, 55 S.Ct. 21, 79 L.Ed.\n208 (1934), and there is no legitimate doubt that courts in the newly independent United\nStates engrafted this privilege against courthouse arrests onto American common law. In\n1804, for instance, Justice Washington, riding circuit in Pennsylvania, invoked the privilege\nto authorize the release of a New York resident arrested on a writ of capias ad\nsatisfaciendum while in the state to testify at\n22\n*22 trial. See Hurst's Case, 4 U.S. (4 Dall.) 387, 387-89, 12 F. Cas. 1019, 1019-20 (C.C.D.\nPa. 1804). State courts in the early nineteenth century widely agreed that parties and\nwitnesses attending court were not subject to arrest in civil suits. See, e.g., Norris v. Beach,\n2 Johns. 294, 294 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1807) (per curiam); Fletcher v. Baxter, 2 Aik. 224, 228-29\n(Vt. 1827); Richards v. Goodson, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 381, 381-82 (Va.Gen. Ct. 1823); cf. In re\nM'Neil, 3 Mass. (2 Tyng) 288, 288 (1807) (recognizing privilege but not specifying nature of\n\narrest). Questions concerning the privilege often arose in cases involving parties and\nwitnesses crossing state lines to attend court, but the scope of the privilege was not\nexpressly limited to nonresidents. See, e.g., Hurst's Case, 4 U.S. (4 Dall.) at 387-89, 12 F.\nCas. at 1019-20; Norris, 2 Johns. at 294; cf. Thompson's Case, 122 Mass. 428, 429 (1877)\n(explaining that privilege against arrest applied to parties and witnesses \"whether they are\nresidents of this state or come from abroad\").\nThe practice of arresting parties as a means of securing personal jurisdiction in civil suits\nappears to have persisted to some degree into the late nineteenth and early twentieth\ncenturies, and courts in such cases continued to recognize the vitality of the common law\nprivilege against courthouse arrests. See, e.g., Larned v. Griffin, 12 F. 590, 590 (C.C.D.\nMass. 1882); Dickinson v. Farwell, 71 N.H. 213, 51 A. 624, 625 (1902); Ellis v. De Garmo,\n17 R.I. 715, 24 A. 579, 579-80 (1892); see also Monroe v. St. Clair Cir. Judge, 125 Mich.\n283, 84 N.W. 305, 306 (1900) (confirming existence of privilege but declining to discharge\narrestee based on circumstances of arrest). Over time, though, personal service of a\nsummons generally supplanted the writ of capias ad respondendum as the method for\nsecuring personal jurisdiction over a defendant in a civil action, see Murphy Bros., 526 U.S.\nat 350, 119 S.Ct. 1322, and arrests in civil suits fell largely out of fashion.\nAs this shift took place, some courts determined, early on, that the privilege against arrest\npursuant to a writ of capias ad respondendum should not extend to service of a summons.\nSee Christian v. Williams, 35 Mo. App. 297, 303 (Ct. App. 1889) (collecting cases); see also\nBlight v. Fisher, 3 F. Cas. 704, 704-05 (C.C.D.N.J. 1809) (holding that privilege of parties\nand witnesses \"extend[ed] only to an exemption from arrest,\" not service of summons). But\nthis view did not prevail: recognizing that the threat of service of a summons still risked\nchilling court attendance, the majority of courts eventually ruled that a similar privilege\nagainst service of a summons should extend to at least some parties and witnesses. See\nStewart v. Ramsay, 242 U.S. 128, 129-31, 37 S.Ct. 44, 61 L.Ed. 192 (1916) (collecting\ncases). Courts usually framed this privilege as protecting nonresidents who had to enter a\njurisdiction to attend court proceedings. See, e.g., Diamond v. Earle, 217 Mass. 499, 105\nN.E. 363, 363 (1914); Richardson v. Smith, 74 N.J.L. 111, 65 A. 162, 163 (N.J.1906); Parker\nv. Marco, 136 N.Y. 585, 32 N.E. 989, 989 (1893). The Supreme Court adopted such a\nframing of the privilege as a matter of federal common law in 1916, holding that \"suitors, as\nwell as witnesses, coming from another State or jurisdiction, are exempt from the service of\ncivil process while in attendance upon court, and during a reasonable time in coming and\ngoing.\" Stewart, 242 U.S. at 129, 37 S.Ct. 44; see Page Co. v. Macdonald, 261 U.S. 446,\n448, 43 S.Ct. 416, 67 L.Ed. 737 (1923). Nevertheless, the Court restated the rule twice in\nthe early 1930s without explicitly limiting its scope to nonresidents. See Long, 293 U.S. at\n83, 55 S.Ct. 21; Lamb v. Schmitt, 285 U.S. 222, 225, 52 S.Ct. 317, 76 L.Ed. 720 (1932).\n23\n\n*23 Relying on this history, the defendants argue that the common law privilege against\ncourthouse arrests in civil suits evolved well before 1952 into a privilege against personal\nservice of a summons — a privilege that they say was available only to nonresidents\nentering a jurisdiction for the purpose of attending court. We should not presume that\nCongress intended to incorporate the common law privilege against courthouse arrests into\nthe INA, their thesis runs, because the privilege (at least insofar as it applied to arrests) was\na dead letter when Congress passed the statute. The plaintiffs rejoin that the privilege\nagainst courthouse arrests expanded to safeguard against service of a summons but did\nnot die off in its original form.\nThe short of it is that the parties draw radically different conclusions from essentially the\nsame nucleus of historical facts. Although the defendants' argument about the evolution of\nthe common law privilege seems plausible, we need not make a definitive ruling in this\nregard because there is a clearer path leading to the conclusion that the plaintiffs have\nfailed to demonstrate a likelihood of success with respect to their nonderogation theory.[5]\nEven if (as the plaintiffs posit) the privilege against courthouse arrests retained some vitality\nin 1952, the plaintiffs' reliance on the nonderogation canon is misplaced. They have not\ndemonstrated that there was a long-established and familiar common law rule protecting\nagainst civil arrests on behalf of the sovereign. Put another way, we cannot presume that\nCongress intended to incorporate the privilege into the INA because the plaintiffs have not\nshown that it was clear in 1952 that the privilege had any application to the type of arrest\nauthorized by the INA. We explain briefly.\nTo recapitulate, the nonderogation canon only informs the construction of a federal statute\nwhen a relevant common law rule was long-established and familiar at the time of the\nstatute's enactment. See Pasquantino, 544 U.S. at 359-60, 125 S.Ct. 1766; Texas, 507 U.S.\nat 534, 113 S.Ct. 1631. The contours of the relevant common law rule are of decretory\nsignificance. See Pasquantino, 544 U.S. at 362, 125 S.Ct. 1766. Those contours must be\ndelineated clearly and precisely. See id. at 360, 362, 125 S.Ct. 1766.\nPasquantino illustrates the point. There, the Supreme Court addressed whether a scheme\nto defraud a foreign nation of tax revenue came within the ambit of the federal wire fraud\nstatute. See id. at 352-53, 125 S.Ct. 1766. The petitioners contended that the Court should\nrefrain from construing the statute in this manner in order to avoid derogating from the\ncommon law revenue rule, which prohibited the collection of a foreign tax liability. See id. at\n359, 361, 125 S.Ct. 1766. The Court rejected this contention, holding that \"[t]he wire fraud\nstatute derogates from no well-established revenue rule principle.\" Id. at 360, 125 S.Ct.\n1766. In this wise, the Court explained that no case decided before the statute's enactment\n\"held or clearly implied that the revenue rule barred the United States from prosecuting a\nfraudulent scheme to evade foreign taxes\" and that its purposes did not \"plainly suggest\nthat it swept so broadly.\" Id. Along the way, the Court declined the plaintiffs' invitation to\nanalogize the type of prosecution under consideration to factually distinct\n\n24\n*24 circumstances in which the revenue rule had been applied, such as civil suits indirectly\nseeking to enforce a foreign tax obligation. See id. at 362-68, 125 S.Ct. 1766.\nPasquantino teaches that the party seeking to read a common law rule into the statute can\nonly do so if the factual circumstances are closely analogous to a case of which Congress\nwould have been aware. See id. at 364-65, 125 S.Ct. 1766 (explaining that absence of such\na case prevented Court from \"say[ing] with any reasonable certainty whether Congress in\n1952 would have considered this prosecution within the revenue rule\"). In other words, the\nproponent of the rule cannot rely exclusively on attenuated analogies and speculative\ninferences to show that the rule was long-established and familiar at the time of the statute's\nenactment. See id. While the nonderogation canon allows certain commonsense and\nobvious comparisons, see Bank of Am. Corp. v. City of Miami, ___ U.S. ___, 137 S. Ct.\n1296, 1305, 197 L.Ed.2d 678 (2017) (reading proximate cause requirement into cause of\naction for damages under Fair Housing Act, which is \"akin\" to tort claim), we only read a\ncommon law rule into the statute if it generally qualifies as long-established and familiar and\nif it is widely regarded as applicable to the specific subject matter covered by the statute.\nIn the case at hand, the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that they are likely to succeed\nin showing that the common law privilege against courthouse arrests clearly applied to civil\nimmigration arrests. First and foremost, the plaintiffs have not offered any pre-1952 case\nlaw from an American court that directly addresses the applicability of the privilege either to\ncivil immigration arrests or to fairly comparable forms of civil arrest, that is, civil arrests on\nbehalf of a sovereign. Nor (to the extent that they might be probative of how Congress\nwould have viewed the common law in 1952) do we find direct guidance on this score in the\nEnglish sources proffered by the parties. None expressly states whether the privilege\nprotected against arrests in some or all crown-initiated civil suits. The same lack of clarity is\ncharacteristic of the literature: the plaintiffs do not identify a single treatise or article directly\nstating that the common law privilege extended to civil arrests on behalf of the sovereign.\nWhat skimpy authority there is tends to suggest that crown-initiated suits may well have\nbeen exempted from the operation of the privileges against arrest in court under English\ncommon law. For example, cases and treatises indicate that certain litigation-related\nprivileges protecting attorneys on account of their necessary attendance in court did not\napply in the context of such suits. See, e.g., Wheely v. Richam, (1734) 92 Eng. Rep. 882,\n882 (K.B.); 1 William Tidd, The Practice of the Court of King's Bench in Personal Actions\n264, 268 (William P. Farrand 1807) (1804). At the end of the day, these authorities may\nstrengthen the defendants' hand — the two sets of privileges are intimately related, as both\nof them developed in order to ensure that necessary persons attended court proceedings,\nsee 6 Matthew Bacon, A New Abridgement of the Law 530 (7th ed. 1832) (explaining that\n\"[t]he law not only allows privileges to the officers of the court, but also protects all those\nwhose attendance is necessary in courts,\" including parties to a civil suit) — but they are not\n\ndispositive because they concern the privilege enjoyed by attorneys, not the privilege at\nissue here.\nFor their part, the plaintiffs — like Rumpelstiltskin — try to convert dross into gold. They\nstrive to persuade us to treat the fact that various English treatises\n25\n*25 did not mention an exception for crown-initiated civil suits to the privilege for parties and\nwitnesses, see, e.g., Tidd, supra, at 174-75, as conclusive evidence that no such exception\nexisted. We are not convinced: the absence of any mention of arrests on behalf of the\nsovereign, when coupled with the utter dearth of any case law holding such arrests to be\nwithin the ambit of the privilege, undercuts the claim that such an application of the privilege\nshould be regarded as long-established and familiar.[6]\nWhere does this leave us? The absence of clear precedent involving fairly comparable\nforms of civil arrest throws considerable shade on the plaintiffs' effort to show that, in 1952,\nthere was a long-established and familiar common law rule privileging individuals attending\ncourt on official business from civil immigration arrests, but it does not drive a final nail into\nthe coffin of their nonderogation theory. It remains a possibility that we might be able to\npresume that Congress meant to incorporate such a common law privilege into the INA if\nthe case law as of 1952 \"clearly implied\" that the privilege would extend to such arrests.\nPasquantino, 544 U.S. at 360, 125 S.Ct. 1766. On further perscrutation, though, this\npossibility dissipates: our canvass of the case law discloses nothing resembling a clear\nimplication to this effect.\nThe centerpiece of the plaintiffs' forecast that the common law privilege would have applied\nto civil immigration arrests is their claim that, historically, the privilege protected against any\nand all forms of civil arrest. This claim, if supportable, would take them a long way toward\ntheir goal, given that immigration arrests are undeniably civil in nature. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Encarnacion, 239 F.3d 395, 400 (1st Cir. 2001) (referring to \"civil deportation\narrests and detentions under 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(2)\"). Such arrests aim to facilitate the\nremoval of noncitizens from the country, see United States v. Vasquez-Benitez, 919 F.3d\n546, 553 (D.C. Cir. 2019); cf. Demore v. Kim, 538 U.S. 510, 528, 123 S.Ct. 1708, 155\nL.Ed.2d 724 (2003) (explaining that detention during removal proceedings of noncitizens\nwho have certain criminal convictions \"increas[es] the chance that, if ordered removed,\n[they] will be successfully removed\"), which is a civil — not criminal — sanction, see Padilla\nv. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356, 365, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010); Harisiades v.\nShaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580, 594, 72 S.Ct. 512, 96 L.Ed. 586 (1952). So, too, courts\ndiscussing the scope of the common law privilege sometimes used language suggesting\nthat the privilege had broad application to many types of civil arrests. See, e.g., Underwood\nv. Fosha, 73 Kan. 408, 85 P. 564, 565 (1906) (describing privilege for parties and witnesses\n\"from civil arrest\"); Fisher v. Bouchelle, 134 W.Va. 333, 61 S.E.2d 305, 306 (1950) (referring\n\nto \"long existing rule ... that courts will not permit their proceedings to be disturbed by the\narrest in a civil case\" of parties and witnesses).\nDigging deeper, though, discloses that the plaintiffs' claim is insupportable. The authorities\nthat the plaintiffs muster in their attempt to demonstrate a well-established and familiar\ncommon law rule mostly involved civil arrests in private litigation,\n26\n*26 and the exceptions, though silent on the nature of the underlying lawsuits, offer no\nreason to think that they arose out of actions brought on behalf of a sovereign. The plaintiffs\ntrack the origins of the privilege to cases involving arrests on common law writs in suits\nbetween private parties. See, e.g., Norris, 2 Johns. at 294; Fletcher, 2 Aik. at 224-25,\n228-29; Richards, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) at 381-82; Walpole, 99 Eng. Rep. at 530-31; Ex parte\nByne, 35 Eng. Rep. at 124. Similarly, cases that recognized the continuing vitality of the\nprivilege in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries almost always involved the\narrest of a party to a private civil suit. See, e.g., Larned, 12 F. at 590; Monroe, 84 N.W. at\n306; Dickinson, 51 A. at 625; Ellis, 24 A. at 579-80. As far we can tell, none involved an\narrest on behalf of a sovereign.\nBecause the entirety of the pre-1952 case law pertaining to the common law privilege\nappears to have involved private civil suits, we think that any language in the case law\nsuggesting a broader rule that the privilege applied to all forms of civil arrest can best be\nread as shorthand for a statement that the privilege applied to a wide swath of arrests in\nprivate civil suits. Had Congress inspected the case law in 1952 with any degree of care, we\nare confident that it would have concluded — as we do — that there was no clear historical\nprecedent for extending the privilege to arrests on behalf of the sovereign. Thus, we reject\nthe plaintiffs' assertion that Congress would have reflexively inferred that the privilege\nprotected against any and all forms of civil arrest, including the civil immigration arrests that\nit was authorizing in the INA.\nOf course, the fact that it was well-established and widely understood in 1952 only that the\nprivilege applied to arrests in private civil suits does not necessarily doom the plaintiffs'\nproposed application of the nonderogation theory. After all, Congress might have had no\nreason to believe that the common law would have treated arrests on behalf of the\nsovereign as a breed apart. Cf. Pasquantino, 544 U.S. at 364, 125 S.Ct. 1766 (rejecting\nnonderogation argument when factual differences between common law cases and\napplication of statute were \"significant\"). Here, however, this possibility is more theoretical\nthan real: it is luminously clear to us (and it would have been luminously clear to Congress\nin 1952) that civil immigration arrests differ from arrests in private civil suits in a key respect.\nCivil immigration arrests are initiated by the sovereign in order to vindicate uniquely\nsovereign interests rather than private or proprietary interests. Controlling immigration and\nthe presence of noncitizens within the country are duties and powers vested exclusively in\nthe sovereign. See Dep't of Homeland Sec. v. Thuraissigiam, ___ U.S. ___, 140 S. Ct.\n\n1959, 1982, 207 L.Ed.2d 427 (2020) (\"[T]he power to admit or exclude aliens is a sovereign\nprerogative.\" (quoting Landon v. Plasencia, 459 U.S. 21, 32, 103 S.Ct. 321, 74 L.Ed.2d 21\n(1982))); Galvan v. Press, 347 U.S. 522, 531, 74 S.Ct. 737, 98 L.Ed. 911 (1954) (\"Policies\npertaining to the entry of aliens and their right to remain here are peculiarly concerned with\nthe political conduct of government.\"). It is too abecedarian a proposition to warrant citation\nof authority that a private party cannot initiate proceedings to remove a noncitizen from the\ncountry. Nor does removal remotely resemble any type of civil remedy available to private\nlitigants.\nThe fact that civil immigration arrests are initiated by the sovereign to vindicate uniquely\nsovereign interests is crucial to our analysis. This fact affords a powerful reason to believe\nthat courts would have treated such arrests more like criminal arrests than like the types of\ncivil arrest\n27\n*27 at issue in the cases to which plaintiffs advert. And the plaintiffs — whose skillful lawyers\nvigorously contest every arguable point — do not dispute that the privilege has never been\nthought to protect against criminal arrests or other forms of criminal process. See, e.g., Ex\nparte Levi, 28 F. 651, 652-53 (W.D.S.C. 1886); Cooper v. United States, 48 A.2d 771, 773\n(D.C.Mun. App. 1946); State v. Gillmore, 88 Kan. 835, 129 P. 1123, 1125 (1913); Schwartz\nv. Dutro, 298 S.W. 769, 771 (Mo. 1927); see also 2 Joseph Story, Commentaries on the\nConstitution of the United States 325 (Hilliard, Gray, and Co. 1833) (explaining that\nconstitutional privilege of members of Congress against arrest, which excludes arrests for\ncrimes, mirrors common law privilege against courthouse arrests for parties and witnesses).\nThis is no mere happenstance: although criminal arrests in courthouses risk deterring\nparties and witnesses from coming forward and also risk disrupting ongoing proceedings,\ncourts have refrained from extending the privilege to criminal arrests due to the overriding\nsovereign interests in enforcing the penal laws and protecting the public. See United States\nv. Conley, 80 F. Supp. 700, 702-03 (D. Mass. 1948); cf. Bacon, supra, at 532-33 (explaining\nthat related English common law privilege for attorneys did not apply to \"indictments,\ninformations, or suits, in which the king alone is concerned\" because courts should not\nprotect \"those who offend against the public peace of the community and the king's\ninterest\").\nWe add, moreover, that the analogy between criminal arrests and civil immigration arrests is\nclose enough to preclude us from saying with sufficient confidence that immigration arrests\nwould have fit within the privilege from civil arrest. Just as criminal arrests implicate the\nuniquely sovereign interests in enforcing the penal laws and protecting the public, so too do\ncivil immigration arrests seek to vindicate similar kinds of interests in controlling immigration\nand the presence of noncitizens in the country. And just as the common law privilege was\nnot applied to criminal arrests because of these overriding sovereign interests, one would\nthink (for the same reason) that the privilege would not shield civil immigration arrests.\n\nEspecially in light of this plausible argument for treating civil immigration arrests like criminal\narrests vis-à-vis the privilege, there is no principled way to find that the case law in 1952\nclearly implied that the privilege would have afforded a shield against civil immigration\narrests.\nThe plaintiffs' remaining arguments regarding the privilege are unavailing. They emphasize,\nfor example, that the dual purposes undergirding the privilege in the context of arrests in\nprivate civil suits apply in much the same way to civil immigration arrests. This argument\nhas a patina of plausibility: ICE's policy of conducting civil courthouse arrests may inhibit\nparties and witnesses from attending court proceedings and, in the bargain, it may in certain\ncircumstances disrupt orderly court operations. But even though such considerations may\nhave held dispositive weight when courts determined whether to privilege parties and\nwitnesses from arrests in private civil suits, that reasoning carries much less weight with\nrespect to civil immigration arrests. As we already have made pellucid, civil immigration\narrests implicate uniquely sovereign interests. Consequently, the purposes underlying the\ncommon law privilege comprise too frail a foundation for an assumption that the privilege\nwould have applied to civil immigration arrests.\nWe find equally unconvincing the plaintiffs' attempt to analogize civil immigration arrests and\narrests on a writ of capias ad respondendum. It is true that, viewed from ten thousand feet,\nthese types of arrest\n28\n*28 bear a faint resemblance: each involves a government officer taking someone into\ncustody to ensure his appearance at a civil proceeding. Apart from the \"civil\" label, though,\nremoval proceedings have little in common with a typical private lawsuit. No less an\nauthority than the Supreme Court has referred to removal as a \"unique\" civil penalty in light\nof its particularly harsh consequences and its close connection to the criminal process.\nPadilla, 559 U.S. at 365-66, 130 S.Ct. 1473. To assume that a privilege that protected\nagainst civil arrests pursuant to a writ of capias ad respondendum would translate to\nimmigration arrests because of a few superficial similarities would be to accept exactly the\ntype of attenuated analogy that the Pasquantino Court deemed insufficient to warrant the\napplication of the nonderogation canon. Simply put, the two types of arrest are not fair\ncongeners.\nWe summarize succinctly. The case law is wholly devoid of any clear precedent on whether\nthe common law in 1952 would have applied the privilege against courthouse arrests to civil\nimmigration arrests. The literature is equally nebulous. But even in this shadowy corner of\nthe law, some things are manifest. Although the privilege protected against arrests in private\ncivil suits, it did not apply to criminal arrests — and the fact that civil immigration arrests aim\nto vindicate uniquely sovereign interests supplies a strong reason to think that the common\nlaw would have treated them like criminal arrests for purposes of this privilege. The unique\nnature of removal further undermines any analogy between civil immigration arrests and\n\narrests in private civil suits. Given these disparities, we cannot say with a reasonable\ndegree of assurance that, in 1952, Congress would have considered the civil immigration\narrests authorized in the INA to come within the scope of the common law privilege. See\nPasquantino, 544 U.S. at 364-65, 125 S.Ct. 1766. We conclude, therefore, that the plaintiffs\nare unlikely to succeed in demonstrating a long-established and familiar common law rule\nbarring courthouse arrests that can be presumed to have been incorporated into the INA's\ncivil arrest authority.\nB.\nThis conclusion does not end our odyssey. The plaintiffs have a fallback position: they offer\na different reason why, in Massachusetts, ICE's implementation of the Directive and its\npolicy of conducting civil courthouse arrests exceed its statutory authority. Their rationale is\nthat even if Congress has not incorporated the common law privilege against courthouse\narrests into the INA's civil arrest authority, the statute still should not be construed to allow\nICE officers to conduct civil courthouse arrests that transgress state law. In support, they\nassert that the privilege against courthouse arrests for persons attending court on official\nbusiness is firmly established in Massachusetts common law; that this privilege is\nemblematic of an exercise of the Commonwealth's sovereign power to operate its judiciary;\nand that the INA does not contain a clear statement of Congress's intent to permit civil\nimmigration arrests that violate such a core state-law privilege.\nBefore tackling this argument, we pause to examine the framework that guides our inquiry.\nThe plaintiffs dress their argument in the raiment of preemption, maintaining that the text of\nthe INA fails to rebut the presumption that Congress would not have intended to preempt\nthe Massachusetts common law privilege against courthouse arrests. Federal preemption,\nthough, is typically a defense to an alleged violation of state law, see Lawless v. Steward\nHealth Care Sys., LLC,\n29\n*29 894 F.3d 9, 17 (1st Cir. 2018), and the plaintiffs have sought preliminary injunctive relief\nonly on their APA claim, not on the ground that ICE's implementation of the Directive and its\npolicy of conducting civil courthouse arrests violate Massachusetts law. Refined to bare\nessence, their argument suggests that we should construe the INA in a way that would not\nauthorize civil arrests in a manner that interferes with a state's chosen method of\nmaintaining order and liberty within the confines of the state's courthouses. This suggestion\nfits more neatly under the federalism canon of statutory construction described in Gregory v.\nAshcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 111 S.Ct. 2395, 115 L.Ed.2d 410 (1991). Mindful that the relevant\nportion of the plaintiffs' brief relies heavily on Gregory, we examine their argument through\nthat lens.[7]\n\nThe federalism canon of statutory construction flows from the elementary principle that \"the\nStates retain substantial sovereign powers under our [federal] constitutional scheme.\" Id. at\n461, 111 S.Ct. 2395. When Congress acts within the bounds of its enumerated powers, the\nSupremacy Clause permits it to \"impose its will on the States\" and to \"legislate in areas\ntraditionally regulated by the States.\" Id. at 460, 111 S.Ct. 2395. Given the \"extraordinary\"\nnature of this power, we assume that \"Congress does not exercise [it] lightly.\" Id. It follows\nthat before construing a federal statute in a way that \"would upset the usual constitutional\nbalance of federal and state powers,\" courts must search for a clear statement indicating\nthat such a result represents Congress's intent. Id. at 460-61, 111 S.Ct. 2395; see Bond v.\nUnited States, 572 U.S. 844, 858, 134 S.Ct. 2077, 189 L.Ed.2d 1 (2014).\nThe Supreme Court first described this canon of statutory construction in Gregory, which\naddressed whether Missouri's constitutional mandate that state judges must retire at age\nseventy violated the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA). See\n501 U.S. at 455, 111 S.Ct. 2395. The question before the Court boiled down to whether a\nstate judge qualifies as \"an appointee on the policymaking level\" — a category of persons\nexcluded from the ADEA's sweep. Id. at 464-65, 467, 111 S.Ct. 2395 (quoting 29 U.S.C. §\n630(f)). The Court recognized that a state's choice of qualifications for its judges \"is a\ndecision of the most fundamental sort for a sovereign entity.\" Id. at 460, 111 S.Ct. 2395.\nBecause \"[c]ongressional interference\" with this type of state decisionmaking \"would upset\nthe usual constitutional balance of federal and state powers,\" the Court asked whether the\nADEA contained a clear statement that state judges were included within the statute's\nscope. Id. at 460-61, 467, 111 S.Ct. 2395. Answering this question, the Court concluded\nthat it was \"at least ambiguous whether a state judge is an `appointee on the policymaking\nlevel'\" and, therefore, found that the ADEA did not contain the requisite clear statement\nindicating that Congress intended to\n30\n*30 cover state judges. Id. at 467, 111 S.Ct. 2395.\nInvoking the reasoning of Gregory, the plaintiffs contend that the INA's generic civil arrest\nauthority does not authorize ICE to conduct civil courthouse arrests in Massachusetts\nbecause the statute does not contain a clear statement of Congress's intent to interfere with\nMassachusetts's sovereign decision to protect individuals attending court on official\nbusiness from civil arrests. The district court did not address this contention because it\nfound that the plaintiffs had shown a likelihood of success on the merits of their\nnonderogation theory. See Ryan, 382 F. Supp. 3d at 155-59. This gap in the record\npresents a daunting obstacle. While we generally may affirm a district court's decree on any\nground made manifest by the record, see Kando v. R.I. State Bd. of Elections, 880 F.3d 53,\n58 (1st Cir. 2018); Mason v. Telefunken Semiconductors Am., LLC, 797 F.3d 33, 37-38 (1st\nCir. 2015), this tenet does not permit us to affirm on grounds that are premised on factual\ndeterminations that the district court did not make and that the parties dispute. After all,\n\nexcept in rare circumstances (not present here), an appellate court may not engage in its\nown factfinding where the record contains evidence on a particular point that could lead\nreasonable factfinders to competing conclusions. See Candelario-Del-Moral v. UBS Fin.\nServs. Inc. of P.R. (In re Efron), 746 F.3d 30, 38 (1st Cir. 2014); Dedham Water Co. v.\nCumberland Farms Dairy, Inc., 972 F.2d 453, 463 (1st Cir. 1992).\nThis is such a case. The absence of pertinent factfinding by the district court, coupled with\nthe conflicting data points in the record on Massachusetts's policy on courthouse arrests,\nleads inexorably to a conclusion that we cannot affirm the entry of the preliminary injunction\nbased on the plaintiffs' clear-statement argument.\nTo be sure, the plaintiffs' argument rests on an uncontroversial premise: the operation of a\nfunctioning judiciary is unmistakably a fundamental exercise of state sovereignty. See Atl.\nCoast Line R.R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Eng'rs, 398 U.S. 281, 285, 287, 90 S.Ct.\n1739, 26 L.Ed.2d 234 (1970) (explaining that states reserved power to maintain \"judicial\nsystems for the decision of legal controversies\" and referring to \"the fundamental\nconstitutional independence of the States and their courts\"). Inasmuch as congressional\ninterference with a state's ability to manage the core functions of its judiciary would tilt the\nconstitutional balance between state and federal power, courts must be certain of\nCongress's intent before interpreting a federal statute to authorize such interference.\nAgainst this backdrop, we assume — solely for purposes of this appeal — that a decision by\nMassachusetts to prohibit at least some courthouse arrests would represent an exercise of\nthe Commonwealth's sovereign power to operate its judiciary, one with which Congress\nwould not readily interfere.\nHere, however, the train goes off the tracks when we move from the theoretical state of\naffairs to the actual state of affairs. Because the plaintiffs' argument is premised on the\nnotion that construing the INA to authorize civil courthouse arrests would clash with a\nsovereign state decision, we must know the scope of Massachusetts's policy on courthouse\narrests in order to evaluate the argument. Without such knowledge, we cannot determine\nwhether and to what extent the INA's civil arrest authority and ICE's actions pursuant to that\nauthority may (or may not) interfere with Massachusetts's exercise of its sovereign power.\nAnd because the parties seeking a preliminary injunction bear\n31\n*31 the burden of demonstrating a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim, see\nNew Comm Wireless Servs., 287 F.3d at 9, the plaintiffs bear the burden of establishing the\ncontours of the relevant Massachusetts policy (which is an essential factual predicate to the\nsuccess of their argument). They have so far failed to carry this burden.\nThe plaintiffs demur, contending that the Commonwealth's policy is embodied exclusively in\nthe relevant Massachusetts case law on the common law privilege against courthouse\narrests. To buttress this contention, they point out that throughout the nineteenth century,\n\nthe SJC recognized that parties and witnesses were privileged from civil arrests while\nattending court proceedings. See Thompson's Case, 122 Mass. at 429; May v. Shumway,\n82 Mass. (16 Gray) 86, 86-87 (1860) (per curiam); Wood v. Neale, 71 Mass. (5 Gray) 538,\n538 (1855); In re M'Neil, 3 Mass. (2 Tyng) at 288. They note, as well, that the SJC referred\nto this rule again in both 1914 and 1968 (albeit in cases involving the related privilege\nprotecting against service of a summons). See Valley Bank & Tr. Co. v. Marrewa, 354 Mass.\n403, 237 N.E.2d 677, 680 (1968); Diamond, 105 N.E. at 363. Although the SJC has never\naddressed whether the privilege protects against civil immigration arrests, Justice Cypher, in\na single justice opinion, recently described her view \"that there exists a common law\nprivilege against civil arrest in Massachusetts and that the privilege, as a matter of State\nlaw, is broad enough to include arrests by Federal officers.\" Matter of C. Doe, No.\nSJ-2018-119, slip op. at 12 (Mass. Sept. 18, 2018). The plaintiffs urge us to take Justice\nCypher's analysis to mean that all civil immigration arrests of noncitizens attending court on\nofficial business violate Massachusetts law and policy.\nBut this case law on the common law privilege is far from the only data point in the record\nregarding Massachusetts's policy on courthouse arrests. In November of 2017, the Chief\nJustice of the Massachusetts Trial Court promulgated a set of rules governing how \"staff\nshall respond when [ICE officers] enter a Massachusetts courthouse with the intent of taking\ncustody of an individual.\" These rules specify that ICE officers may not civilly arrest\nnoncitizens in nonpublic areas of state courthouses or (absent advance permission) in\ncourtrooms. Withal, they recognize that ICE officers may otherwise conduct civil immigration\narrests in courthouses as long as they follow certain procedures and do not disrupt court\noperations. This arrangement, as the defendants emphasize, is seemingly at odds with the\nplaintiffs' interpretation of the Massachusetts common law privilege; it indicates that\nMassachusetts courts do not object to all civil immigration arrests of noncitizens attending\ncourt on official business.\nThe bottom line is that we are confronted with an unsettled record concerning\nMassachusetts's policy on courthouse arrests. Since the district court grounded the\npreliminary injunction solely on its determination that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on\ntheir nonderogation theory — a determination that turned on its mistaken assessment of\nlong-established common law throughout the country rather than the particulars of\nMassachusetts law or policy, see Ryan, 382 F. Supp. 3d at 155-59 — it did not perform any\nfactfinding that would assist in clarifying this unsettled area of the record. Nor did the court\nattempt to reconcile the plaintiffs' interpretation of the Massachusetts common law privilege\nagainst courthouse arrests with the Trial Court's rules, thus appearing to accept as a given\nICE's authority to arrest certain noncitizens purportedly protected by the privilege.\n32\n*32 This gap in the record is material in the sense that the manner in which it is filled could\naffect the outcome of the case. What is more, there is no avenue (short of a remand)\n\nthrough which we can bridge it. Undertaking the missing factfinding in the first instance not\nonly would usurp the district court's prerogative but also would exceed the limits of our\nappellate role. See In re Efron, 746 F.3d at 38; Dedham Water Co., 972 F.2d at 463. Such\nan act of judicial hubris, problematic at any time, would be especially unwise where, as\nhere, the record on appeal is glaringly underdeveloped.\nAn example serves to illustrate this point. The plaintiffs attempt to diminish the significance\nof the Trial Court's rules as evidence of Massachusetts's policy on courthouse arrests by\narguing that a broader ban on civil immigration arrests in courthouses would be futile\nbecause ICE has made clear that it would not comply with such a ban. Relatedly, the\nplaintiffs argue that the Trial Court enacted these rules in order to restrict the involvement of\ncourt staff in ICE's enforcement actions rather than to cooperate with ICE. But without more\ninformation about both ICE's intent and the nature and purpose of the Trial Court's rules, we\nare left with a predicate that is manifestly inadequate for answering the factual questions\nthat must be answered to resolve these arguments.\nThat ends this aspect of the matter. Given the unsettled nature of the record and the\nabsence of pertinent factfinding by the district court, we cannot conclude that the plaintiffs\nhave made a sufficient showing of Massachusetts's policy on courthouse arrests to carry\ntheir burden. And without such a showing, we have no baseline from which we can assess\nwhether the INA's civil arrest authority may (or may not) interfere with the state's sovereign\npower to operate its judiciary.[8]\nHere, moreover, a myriad of other factors beyond the underdeveloped record must be\nfactored into the equation. For one thing, the parties have not fully explored the\nramifications of the Gregory-based argument in their briefing.[9] For another thing, the\nargument raises complex and novel legal issues, and we do not have the benefit of the\ndistrict court's insights on those issues. To add yet another complication, it is unclear\nwhether a policy forbidding the arrest of all individuals attending court proceedings would\nconstitute the type of exercise of state sovereignty that triggers Gregory's clear-statement\nrule. See 501 U.S. at 460, 111 S.Ct. 2395 (emphasizing that state constitutional provision\nsetting qualifications for judges \"is a decision of the most fundamental sort for a sovereign\nentity\"); cf. EEOC v. Massachusetts, 987 F.2d 64, 66, 69 (1st Cir. 1993) (finding Gregory\ninapplicable in deciding whether state law requiring public employees to pass medical\nexamination at age seventy violated ADEA). It is possible that\n33\n*33 only a narrower range of courthouse arrests (say, those occurring in the courtroom itself)\nwould fall within this taxonomy. And this is just the tip of the iceberg: taken together, the\nuncertainties that pervade this area of the record counsel in favor of judicial restraint. See\nLevinsky's, Inc. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 127 F.3d 122, 134 (1st Cir. 1997) (refusing to\nresolve complex legal issue for first time on appeal in light of deficiencies in the record,\nabsence of district court opinion, and lack of full briefing from parties).\n\nLet us be perfectly clear. We take no view on the role, if any, that Gregory and the\nfederalism canon may play in construing the scope of the INA's civil arrest authority. Nor do\nwe make any determination about the law or policy of Massachusetts vis-à-vis courthouse\narrests. With respect to this issue, we conclude only that, without additional factfinding, the\nlack of clarity in the record about Massachusetts's policy on courthouse arrests prevents us\nfrom determining whether or not the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their\nGregory-based argument. Following remand, the district court may evaluate this argument,\neither on a renewed motion for preliminary injunction or on the merits, with the help of both\na better-developed record and more exegetic briefing. As part of its evaluation, the district\ncourt may consider whether, on a better-developed record, it would be appropriate to certify\na question or questions to the SJC in order to pin down Massachusetts's policy on\ncourthouse arrests. See Mass. S.J.C. Rule 1:03; see also Matter of C. Doe, No.\nSJ-2018-119, slip op. at 12 n.14 (Mass. Sept. 18, 2018) (\"If a Federal Court were at all in\ndoubt about the continued existence of the privilege in Massachusetts, or its applicability in\ngiven circumstances, it would of course be free to certify to this court any questions it has\nabout the existence and applicability of the privilege.\").\nIII. CONCLUSION\nWe need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we conclude that the plaintiffs\nthus far have failed to show a likelihood of success on the merits of their nonderogation\ntheory, that is, that the Directive and its authorization of civil courthouse arrests by the\nfederal government to enforce the immigration laws, exceed ICE's statutory authority\nbecause the INA implicitly incorporates a common law privilege against courthouse arrests.\nThe district court's contrary ruling was based on a material error of law and, thus, we hold\nthat it constitutes an abuse of discretion. See Corp. Techs., 731 F.3d at 10. So, too, we hold\nthat the plaintiffs have not to this point shown a likelihood of success on their APA claim\nbased on the argument that, in Massachusetts, ICE's implementation of the Directive and its\npolicy of conducting civil courthouse arrests exceed its statutory authority because\nCongress has not made clear its intent to permit ICE to conduct arrests in violation of state\nlaw.[10] As a movant may not secure a preliminary injunction without demonstrating a\nlikelihood of success on the merits, we have no need to consider the parties' arguments\nconcerning either the remainder of the preliminary injunction calculus or the scope of the\ndistrict court's injunction. See\n34\n*34 Wine & Spirits Retailers, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 418 F.3d 36, 54 (1st Cir. 2005).\nWe vacate the preliminary injunction and remand to the district court for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion. All parties shall bear their own costs.\nVacated and remanded.\n\n[1]At present, the three individual defendants, named in their official capacities, are Chad Wolf, Acting Secretary of\nDHS; Matthew T. Albence, Acting Deputy Director of ICE (who, as the senior official currently in place, performs the\nduties of the Director); and Todd M. Lyons, ICE's Acting Boston Field Office Director.\n[2]Throughout this litigation, the plaintiffs havedescribed the individuals whom they believe ICE officers may not\ncivilly arrest in and around courthouses as those attending court \"on official business.\" The plaintiffs have not clearly\ndefined the contours of this phrase, but they seem to mean parties, witnesses, and victims at a bare minimum.\nNotwithstanding this potential lack of clarity, the district court adopted the terminology. SeeRyan,382 F. Supp. 3d at\n146, 161. We, too, use it as a convenient shorthand.\n[3]ICE's implementation of the Directive was debatedextensively during the preliminary injunction hearing. The\ndefendants represented that ICE applies the Directive in conjunction with a prior policy discouraging the removal of\nvictims, witnesses, and other noncitizens attempting to protect their noncriminal legal rights. In line with this policy,\nICE \"generally\" conducts courthouse arrests only of criminal defendants and not of victims, witnesses, and civil\nlitigants.Ryan, 382 F. Supp. 3d at 161. The plaintiffsdid not dispute this account of how ICE was implementing the\nDirective but observed that the Directive's language appears to authorize a broader range of civil arrests. At any rate,\nthe precise manner in which ICE is implementing the Directive is largely irrelevant to the resolution of this appeal. To\nthe extent that we rely on facts relative to ICE's implementation of the Directive, those facts are uncontroverted.\n[4]The defendants did not renew their attack on standingin their appellate briefing and, at oral argument, they\ndisclaimed any intention of pressing this offensive. Even so, we have an independent duty to ensure that\nconstitutional standing exists before proceeding to the merits. SeeMerrimon v. Unum Life Ins. Co. ofAm., 758 F.3d\n46, 52 (1st Cir. 2014). We have reviewed the parties'submissions in the court below and, for substantially the\nreasons given by the district court, seeRyan, 382F. Supp. 3d at 152-55,we conclude that the plaintiffshave\nconstitutional standing to pursue their APA claim.\n[5]For the same reason, we have no need to explorethe defendants' related argument that the privilege as it applied\nto service of process narrowed significantly after the Supreme Court held inInternational Shoe Co.v. Washington,\n326 U.S. 310, 316, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945),that due process permits the exercise of personal jurisdiction\nover certain parties who reside outside of the territorial boundaries of the state.\n[6]For similar reasons, we do not find dispositivethat Blackstone's treatise described the common law privilege in a\nchapter on initiating process for suits involving \"private wrongs,\" a category that apparently included certain \"injuries\nproceeding from, or affecting, the crown.\" 3 William Blackstone, Commentaries *254, *289. Notably, Blackstone's\ndescription of the attorney privileges appears on the same page, but he did not mention the well-settled exception for\ncrown-initiated civil suits applicable to those privileges. See id. at *289.\n[7]It is worth noting that the federalism canon ofstatutory construction and the presumption against preemption of\nstate law are intimately related doctrines. Both reflect a reluctance to ascribe to Congress an intent to interfere with a\nstate's exercise of its sovereign powers, seeRaygorv. Regents of the Univ. of Minn., 534 U.S. 533, 543-44, 122 S.Ct.\n999, 152 L.Ed.2d 27 (2002),and Congress must clearlystate such an intent if the presumption created by either\ndoctrine is to be rebutted, compareWyeth v. Levine,555 U.S. 555, 565, 129 S.Ct. 1187, 173 L.Ed.2d 51 (2009)\n(preemption), withGregory, 501 U.S. at 460-61, 111S.Ct. 2395(federalism canon). Consequently, ouranalysis would\nproceed in much the same manner were we to examine the plaintiffs' argument under the rubric of preemption.\n[8]Once again, an example helps to illustrate thepoint. The defendants represented at oral argument that ICE has\nexercised its civil arrest authority in compliance with the Trial Court's rules. If so, and if those rules comport with\nMassachusetts's policy, we would be hard-pressed to hold that ICE's exercise of its civil arrest authority clashes with\nthe Commonwealth's sovereign power in a way that would engender federalism concerns. Under such a scenario, it\nis questionable whether Gregory's clear-statement rule would be triggered at all.\n[9]Although there are many such ramifications, oneis particularly striking. If taken to its logical end point, the\nplaintiffs' Gregory-based argument leads to a strange result: ICE's authority to conduct civil courthouse arrests might\nvary on a state-by-state basis, depending on each state's policy on the subject.\n\n[10]Certain amici supporting the plaintiffs asseverate that ICE's policy of arresting noncitizens in courthouses is\nunlawful for a variety of other reasons. We decline to address these asseverations. The customary praxis in this\ncircuit is to eschew arguments raised only by amici and not by the parties. See, e.g.,In re Sony BMGMusic Ent., 564\nF.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2009);Lane v. First Nat'l Bankof Bos., 871 F.2d 166, 175 (1st Cir. 1989). We seeno reason to\ndepart from this praxis today.",

E.g., Stewart v. Ramsay, 242 U.S. 128, 129-130 (1916); \nLarned v. Griffin, 12 F. 590, 594 (D. Mass. 1882).  In complete disregard for that well-\nrecognized limitation on the government’s civil-arrest power, United States Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement (“ICE”) has ordered its agents to arrest parties and witnesses appearing in \ncourt—arrests based on alleged civil, not criminal, immigration infractions.  As a result, tens of \nthousands of Massachusetts residents will not set foot in Massachusetts courts.  Victims of \ndomestic violence or of abusive practices by landlords and employers tolerate that abuse rather \nthan risk ICE arrest.  Criminal defendants accept default rather than risk appearing in court.  And \nwhen prospective plaintiffs, victims, witnesses, and defendants do not appear in court, civil and \ncriminal prosecution and defense often become impossible.  In short, ICE’s new and \nunprecedented policy has undermined access to justice in the precise way that common-law \ncourts have predicted and protected against for centuries.   \nPlaintiffs—the District Attorneys for two of the largest counties in Massachusetts, the \nMassachusetts public defender agency, and a membership-based community organization that \nprotects the rights of many immigrant Massachusetts residents—bring this suit to stop ICE from \ncarrying out this unprecedented policy.  Given the plainly unlawful nature of ICE’s conduct, and \nthe irreparable harm it is causing to Plaintiffs and the Massachusetts public, this Court should \nenjoin ICE from civilly arresting victims, parties, and witnesses attending Massachusetts courts \nduring the pendency of this lawsuit.   \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 6   Filed 04/29/19   Page 9 of 28\n \nPlaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of all of their claims, but this Court need \nonly reach the first:  Congress did not grant ICE the authority to violate the common-law \nprivilege and civilly arrest parties, witnesses, and others attending court on official business, and \nICE’s Directive authorizing these arrests is thus “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or \nlimitations” and must be “set aside” under the Administrative Procedure Act.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  \nAs a federal agency, ICE “literally has no power to act . . . unless and until Congress confers \npowers upon it.”  La. Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986).  The INA confers \nonly a general civil-arrest power—the statute is silent concerning the scope of that power.  See 8 \nU.S.C. §§ 1226(a), 1357(a)(2).  Under longstanding principles of statutory interpretation, such a \nCongressional authorization of a well-understood power like civil arrest presumptively carries \nwith it the limitations that accompanied that power at common law.  See, e.g., United States v. \nTexas, 507 U.S. 529, 534 (1993); Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 \nU.S. 118, 129 (2014).  That interpretive principle is directly applicable here:  Congress’s general \ngrant of civil-arrest power does not give ICE unbridled authority to conduct civil arrests \nwhenever and however it wants, but instead incorporates within it the common-law limitations \non the civil-arrest power, including the well-settled common-law rule that the government cannot \ncivilly arrest victims, witnesses, and parties appearing in court.  This interpretation is further \nsupported by the serious constitutional questions that would arise from authorizing federal agents \nto conduct civil arrests against victims, witnesses, and parties attending state courts.   \nICE’s policy is not only unlawful, it is causing ongoing and irreparable harm to Plaintiffs \nand the public.  As the supporting declarations show, the chilling effect of ICE’s policy is real, \nand its effects are dramatic.  For instance, prior to ICE’s policy, Plaintiff Chelsea Collaborative’s \nnoncitizen members routinely appeared in Massachusetts courts.  But since ICE’s civil-\n2 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 6   Filed 04/29/19   Page 10 of 28\n \ncourthouse-arrest policy, even those suffering from domestic violence or clear violations of \nMassachusetts law will not use the courts for fear of ICE arrest.  The problem has become so \nsevere that Chelsea Collaborative has been forced to devote significant resources to establishing \nits own, entirely new, mediation system to attempt to resolve disputes involving those who will \nnot appear in Massachusetts courts for fear of civil ICE arrest.  Noncitizens’ refusal to appear in \ncourt also creates obvious and irreparable harms to the District Attorneys and the Committee for \nPublic Counsel Services (“CPCS”)—if crime victims, witnesses, and defendants will not appear \nin court, prosecution and criminal defense become much more difficult, and at times impossible.   \nBecause ICE’s policy plainly exceeds its statutory authority, and because it is causing \ncontinuous and irreparable harm to Plaintiffs and the public, this Court should enjoin Defendants \nfrom carrying out these unlawful civil arrests during the pendency of this suit.1 \nFACTS \n  As the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized, the government’s civil-arrest power is \nlimited at common law by a “well settled” privilege against civil arrests of parties, \nwitnesses, and others appearing in court on official business. \nIn England, and in the early years of this country, civil proceedings were often initiated \nby having the government civilly arrest the defendant to guarantee his or her appearance in court.  \nSee Nathan Levy, Jr., Mensne Process in Personal Actions at Common Law and the Power \nDoctrine, 78 Yale L.J. 52, 61-70 (1968).  The possibility that such civil arrests could take place \nin court, however, posed a significant problem for the judicial system:  If a party or witness’s \nappearance in one case could be used as a trap for a civil arrest in another case, many parties and \nwitnesses would not attend court.  To avoid this problem, courts both in England and the United \nStates, including the Supreme Court and this Court, all recognized and strictly enforced an \n                                                 \n1 This Memorandum uses the phrase “civil courthouse arrests” to mean arrests of those attending court for official \nbusiness under their own power.  Plaintiffs are not challenging in this litigation ICE’s authority to arrest those \nbrought into court while in state custody.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 6   Filed 04/29/19   Page 11 of 28\n \n“inflexib[le]” privilege, and an “absolute protection,” against the civil arrest of parties or \nwitnesses attending court.  Page Co. v. MacDonald, 261 U.S. 446, 448 (1923); Larned, 12 F. at \n594.  As the Supreme Court explained, “the due administration of justice requires that a court \nshall not permit interference with the progress of a cause pending before it, by the service of \nprocess in other suits, which would prevent, or the fear of which might tend to discourage, the \nvoluntary attendance of those whose presence is necessary or convenient to the judicial \nadministration in the pending litigation.”  Lamb v. Schmitt, 285 U.S. 222, 225 (1932).   \nThe common-law privilege against civil arrest while attending court on official business \ntraces its origins back at least to English courts in the eighteenth century.  Blackstone’s \nCommentaries on the Laws of England explained the common-law rule that “[s]uitors, witnesses, \nand other persons, necessarily attending any courts of record upon business, are not to be \narrested during their actual attendance, which includes their necessary coming and returning.”  \n3 William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 289 (1768); see also 6 Matthew \nBacon, A New Abridgment of the Law 530 (London, A. Strahan, 7th ed. 1832) (“[A]ll other \npersons whatsoever, are freed from arrests, so long as they are in view of any of the courts at \nWestminster, or if near the courts, though out of view, lest any disturbance may be occasioned to \nthe courts or any violence used.”).  This principle was repeatedly endorsed by the English courts, \nwhich held that, “for the purposes of justice,” and “to encourage witnesses to come forward \nvoluntarily,” they are privileged from arrest “in coming, in staying, and in returning” from court.  \nThe King v. Holy Trinity in Wareham, 99 Eng. Rep. 530 (1782); see also Meekins v. Smith, 126 \nEng. Rep. 363 (1791) (“[A]ll persons who had relation to a suit which called for their attendance, \nwhether they were compelled to attend by process or not, (in which number bail were included,) \nwere intitled to privilege from arrest endo et redeundo [i.e., coming and returning][.]”); Spence v. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 6   Filed 04/29/19   Page 12 of 28\n \nStuart, 102 Eng. Rep. 530 (1802); Ex Parte Byne, 35 Eng. Rep. 123 (1813).2   \nThe Supreme Court has not only adopted this privilege, but also held that it bars service \nof any other civil process while attending state or federal court.  For instance, in Stewart, the \nCourt described the privilege as “well settled,” explaining that citizens “should be permitted to \napproach [the courts], not only without subjecting himself to evil, but even free from the fear of \nmolestation or hindrance.  He should also be enabled to procure, without difficulty, the \nattendance of all such persons as are necessary to manifest his rights.”  Stewart, 242 U.S. at 129.  \nThe Court described it as particularly firmly established that there was an “exemption from \narrest,” or “capias,” and held that this exemption applied to any civil process to protect the \n“necessities of the judicial administration, which would be often embarrassed, and sometimes \ninterrupted, if the suitor might be vexed with process while attending upon the court for the \nprotection of his rights, or the witness while attending to testify.”  Id. at 129-30.  The Court has \nemphasized the “necessity of [the rule’s] inflexibility” in order to serve its purpose of protecting \nlitigants and witnesses in appearing in court.  Page Co., 261 U.S. at 448; see also Long v. Ansell, \n293 U.S. 76, 83 (1934) (Brandeis, J.) (describing “the common-law rule that witnesses, suitors, \nand their attorneys, while in attendance in connection with the conduct of one suit, are immune \nfrom service in another”); Lamb, 285 U.S. at 225.  The Court has thus held that a federal court \ncan apply the privilege on behalf of a state court.  Page Co., 261 U.S. 488.   \nThis Court has recognized a similarly “absolute protection.”  Larned, 12 F. at 594.  As \nthe Court explained, “[i]t has long been settled that parties and witnesses attending in good faith \nany legal tribunal . . . are privileged from arrest on civil process during their attendance, and for a \nreasonable time in going and returning.”  Id. at 590.  The Court therefore applied the privilege in \n                                                 \n2 The sources cited in this paragraph are attached as Exhibits 1 through 6 of the Zimmer Declaration.  \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 6   Filed 04/29/19   Page 13 of 28\n \nfavor of a witness appearing in a state court proceeding.  Id.  \nThe privilege against civil courthouse arrests is also firmly entrenched in Massachusetts \ncommon law.  As the Supreme Judicial Court has explained, “[p]arties and witnesses, attending \nin good faith any legal tribunal, whether a court of record or not, having power to pass upon the \nrights of the persons attending, are privileged from arrest on civil process during their \nattendance, and for a reasonable time in going and returning.”  Valley Bank & Trust Co. v. \nMarrewa, 237 N.E.2d 677, 680 (Mass. 1968) (quoting In re Thompson, 122 Mass. 428, 429 \n(1877)); see also In re M’Neil, 3 Mass. 287 (1807); Diamond v. Earle, 105 N.E. 363, 363 (Mass. \n1914).  Indeed, Justice Elspeth Cypher recently recognized, in a Single Justice opinion, that the \n“privilege against civil arrest” in attending court is “well settled” in the Commonwealth.  Matter \nof C. Doe, No. SJ-2018-119, at 10-11 (Mass. Sept. 18, 2018) (Zimmer Decl. Ex. 7).   \nThe consistent theme throughout these cases is that strict and absolute enforcement of the \nprivilege is necessary to allow courts to serve their purpose of providing a forum where parties \nand witnesses can freely attend to testify and assert their rights.  In a decision the Supreme Court \nrecognized as a “leading authority” on the privilege, Stewart, 242 U.S. at 129, the New Jersey \nSupreme Court explained that “[c]ourts of justice ought, everywhere, to be open, accessible, free \nfrom interruption, and to cast a perfect protection around every man who necessarily approaches \nthem.”  Halsey v. Stewart, 4 N.J.L. 366, 367 (N.J. 1817).  The “fear that . . . a capias might be \nserved upon [parties and witnesses]” would “prevent [their] approach,” obstructing “this great \nobject in the administration of justice.”  Id. at 368.  In sum: \nThis privilege of parties and witnesses is alike the privilege of the \ncourt and the citizen.  It protects the court from interruption and \ndelay.  It takes away a strong inducement to disobey its process, \nand enables the citizen to prosecute his rights without molestation, \nand  procure  the  attendance  of  such  as  are  necessary  for  their \ndefence and support. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 6   Filed 04/29/19   Page 14 of 28\n \nId. at 368-69.  Thus, “[t]he citizen in every claim of right which he exhibits, and every defense \nwhich he is obliged to make, should be permitted to approach [the courts], not only without \nsubjecting himself to evil, but even free from the fear of molestation or hindrance.  He should \nalso be enabled to procure, without difficulty, the attendance of all such persons as are necessary \nto manifest his rights.”  Stewart, 242 U.S. at 129 (quoting Halsey, 4 N.J.L. at 367-68).   \n  The Immigration and Nationality Act grants a general civil-arrest power, without \nspecifying its scope. \nThe INA’s two civil-arrest provisions originated in the Immigration and Nationality Act \nof 1952, Pub. L. 82-414, 66 Stat. 163, and have changed little since then.  Section 242(a) of the \n1952 Act states that, “[p]ending a determination of deportability in the case of any alien as \nprovided in subsection (b) of this section, such alien may, upon warrant of the Attorney General, \nbe arrested and taken into custody.”  Section 287(a)(2) of that Act authorizes an immigration \nofficer to carry out a warrantless civil arrest “if he has reason to believe that the alien so arrested \nis in the United States in violation of any such law or regulation and is likely to escape before a \nwarrant can be obtained for his arrest.”  That Act thus granted a general civil-arrest power to \nimmigration officers, without suggesting that the power exceeds the scope of the government’s \ncivil-arrest power at common law.  See INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1038 (1984) (“A \ndeportation proceeding is a purely civil action[.]”).  The language Congress enacted in 1952 \nremains largely unchanged today.  See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1226(a), 1357(a)(2). \n  ICE’s Directive No. 11072.1 authorizes civil immigration arrests of parties and \nwitnesses attending court, in violation of the “well settled” common-law privilege. \nFor more than six decades after Congress granted the federal government authority to \ncarry out civil immigration arrests, no federal agency ever officially interpreted that authority to \nextend to arresting parties and witnesses appearing in court.  Starting with President Trump’s \ninauguration in 2017, however, the federal government began publicly insisting that it had the \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 6   Filed 04/29/19   Page 15 of 28\n \nright to carry out such arrests.  For instance, in March 2017, in response to a letter from the Chief \nJustice of the California Supreme Court expressing concern based on reports that ICE officers \nhad been “stalking” individuals attending the California courts, then-Homeland Security \nSecretary John Kelly and then-Attorney General Jefferson Sessions insisted that ICE could and \nwould continue the practice.3  DHS and ICE have also made clear that anyone is subject to an \nICE civil arrest while attending court, including victims of crimes.  For instance, a DHS \nspokesman defended the practice of arresting crime victims in court, stating:   \nJust because they’re a victim in a certain case does not mean \nthere’s not something in their background that could cause them to \nbe a removable alien[.] Just because they’re a witness doesn’t \nmean they might not pose a security threat for other reasons.4   \nICE has, in fact, followed through on such statements, arresting at least one woman when she \nappeared in court to obtain a protective order from an abusive partner.5 \nOn January 10, 2018, ICE formalized its courthouse-arrest policy in Directive No. \n11072.1, entitled “Civil Immigration Enforcement Actions Inside Courthouses” (the \n“Directive”).  Zimmer Decl. Ex. 8.  This Directive “sets forth [ICE’s] policy regarding civil \nimmigration enforcement actions inside federal, state, and local courthouses.”  Id. at 1.  While \nostensibly setting some limitations on ICE enforcement at courthouses, the Directive ultimately \nvests ICE with the unbridled discretion to arrest anyone in virtually any courthouse location \nwhen they deem “necessary,” providing noncitizens no assurance that they will ever be safe from \narrest at court.  Id. at 1-2.   \nThe Directive states that ICE’s courthouse arrests will “include actions against specific, \n                                                 \n3 See Letter from Sessions and Kelly to Cantil-Sakauye (Mar. 29, 2017), https://wapo.st/2vaJYt5. \n4 Devlin Barrett, DHS: Immigration agents may arrest crime victims, witnesses at courthouses, Wash. Post (Apr. 4, \n2017), https://wapo.st/2ZkdwCx. \n5 P.R. Lockhart, Immigrants Face a Choice Between Domestic Violence and Deportation, Mother Jones (March 20, \n2017), http://bit.ly/2VPCYxn.   \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 6   Filed 04/29/19   Page 16 of 28\n \ntarget aliens with criminal convictions, gang members, national security or public safety threats, \naliens who have been ordered removed from the United States but have failed to depart, and \naliens who have re-entered the country illegally after being removed.”  Id. at 1.  But it does not in \nany way limit its arrests to these “target aliens.”  Similarly, the Directive provides that “[a]liens \nencountered during a civil immigration enforcement action inside a courthouse” who are not \n“target alien[s] . . . will not be subject to . . . enforcement action, absent special circumstances.”  \nId.  The Directive does not explain what ICE considers “special circumstances,” but simply \nstates that ICE’s decision will be consistent with an unspecified “U.S. Department of Homeland \nSecurity (DHS) policy.”  Id. at 1 n.1.  Making matters worse, the Directive suggests that DHS \npolicy includes broad enforcement against anyone potentially removable by cross-referencing \nanother DHS memorandum that states that DHS “no longer will exempt classes or categories of \nremovable aliens from potential enforcement.”  Zimmer Decl. Ex. 9 at 2.  Ultimately, the \nDirective simply formalizes the Trump Administration’s consistent policy that ICE has complete \ndiscretion to use federal and state courthouses to arrest anyone suspected of a civil immigration \ninfraction—including victims, witnesses, criminal defendants, and parties to civil proceedings.  \nARGUMENT \n“A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on \nthe merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the \nbalance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.”  Winter v. \nNat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  All four factors strongly favor Plaintiffs. \n  Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in demonstrating that ICE’s policy of conducting civil \ncourthouse arrests exceeds its statutory authority. \nICE’s Directive authorizing civil courthouse arrests is impermissible for the simple \nreason that Congress never granted ICE the power to make such arrests.  ICE’s civil-arrest power \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 6   Filed 04/29/19   Page 17 of 28\n \nis only as broad as the power granted by Congress, see La. Pub. Serv. Comm’n, 476 U.S. at 374, \nand, under well-settled interpretive principles, the INA’s generic grant of civil-arrest authority \nextends only so far as the government’s civil-arrest authority at common law.  At common law, \nthe government’s civil-arrest power was limited by the “well settled” and “inflexib[le]” privilege \nagainst the civil arrest of parties, witnesses, and others attending court on official business.  \nStewart, 242 U.S. at 129; Page Co., 261 U.S. at 448.  ICE’s civil-arrest authority is therefore \ncabined by that common-law privilege.  Further, to the extent there were any ambiguity in the \nscope of ICE’s authority, that ambiguity is resolved by the serious constitutional questions raised \nby allowing ICE to arrest victims, witnesses, and parties attending state court proceedings.  \nPlaintiffs are therefore likely to succeed in showing that ICE’s Directive is “in excess of \nstatutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations,” and is otherwise “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse \nof discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,” and must be “set aside” under the \nAdministrative Procedure Act.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \n \nA.  The civil-arrest power granted by the Immigration and Nationality Act \nincorporates, not abrogates, common-law limitations on civil arrest, \nincluding the common-law privilege against civil courthouse arrests. \nIt is a “longstanding . . . principle that statutes which invade the common law are to be \nread with a presumption favoring the retention of long-established and familiar principles, except \nwhen a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident.”  Texas, 507 U.S. at 534 (quotation marks \nand alterations omitted).  In such cases, “Congress does not write upon a clean slate,” and thus \n“[i]n order to abrogate a common-law principle, the statute must speak directly to the question \naddressed by the common law.”  Id.  (quotation marks omitted).  Put slightly differently, “courts \nmay take it as a given that Congress has legislated with an expectation that the common law \nprinciple will apply” absent a “statutory purpose to the contrary.”  Id. (quotation marks and \nalterations omitted); see also  Samantar v. Yousuf, 560 U.S. 305, 320 n.13 (2010) (“Congress is \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 6   Filed 04/29/19   Page 18 of 28\n \nunderstood to legislate against a background of common-law principles,” and “when a statute \ncovers an issue previously governed by the common law, we interpret the statute with the \npresumption that Congress intended to retain the substance of the common law” (internal \nquotation marks and alterations omitted)); Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 568 U.S. 519, \n538 (2013); Meyer v. Holley, 537 U.S. 280, 285 (2003); Phillips v. Pembroke Real Estate, Inc., \n459 F.3d 128, 142 (1st Cir. 2006); Scharfeld v. Richardson, 133 F.2d 340, 341 (D.C. Cir. 1942) \n(“The courts have consistently held legislation derogative of the common law accountable to an \nexactness of expression, and have not allowed the effects of such legislation to be extended \nbeyond the necessary and unavoidable meaning of its terms.”). \nThe Supreme Court has repeatedly applied this principle and held that when Congress \ninvokes a general common-law principle, it intends to incorporate common-law limitations on \nthat principle.  For instance, the Court has repeatedly held that when Congress creates a tort-like \ncause of action, it presumptively incorporates common-law principles governing tort actions, \neven if those principles are not apparent in the statute’s text.  The Lanham Act, for instance, \ncreates a broad cause of action for “any person who believes that he or she is likely to be \ndamaged” by false advertising—language that, “[r]ead literally,” would allow anyone with \nArticle III standing to bring suit.  See Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 129.  But, this “broad language \nnotwithstanding,” the Lanham Act incorporates “well established” common-law limitations on \ntort liability, like proximate cause, because “Congress, we assume, is familiar with the common-\nlaw rule and does not mean to displace it sub silentio.”  Id. at 132.  The Court has similarly \ninterpreted many other statutes creating causes of action that, read literally, “encompass every \nharm that can be attributed directly or indirectly to the consequences of a[] [statutory] violation” \nto incorporate “common-law damages” principles like proximate cause.  Associated Gen. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 6   Filed 04/29/19   Page 19 of 28\n \nContractors of Cal., Inc. v. Cal. State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 529, 535 (1983) \n(Sherman Act); see also Holmes v. Sec. Inv’r Prot. Corp., 503 U.S. 258, 266-67 (1992) (RICO);  \nBank of Am. Corp. v. City of Miami, 137 S. Ct. 1296, 1305 (2017) (Fair Housing Act).   \nThe Supreme Court (and other courts) have similarly read tort-like statutes as \nincorporating other common-law limits and rules.  For instance, in Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. \n335, 339-40 (1986), the Court held that, though 42 U.S.C. § 1983 “on its face admits of no \nimmunities” because it creates liability for “[e]very person” who violates its terms, it must be \nread “in harmony” with common-law tort limitations, rather than “in derogation of them.”  The \nD.C. Circuit similarly held that, though the Torture Victims Protection Act imposes, without \nlimitation, liability on “an individual” that violates its terms, it does not “abrogate the preexisting \ncommon law” of “head of state immunity.”  Manoharan v. Rajapaksa, 711 F.3d 178, 180 (D.C. \nCir. 2013).  And in Meyer v. Holley, the Court held that the Fair Housing Act’s cause of action, \nwhich “says nothing about vicarious liability,” nevertheless imposes such liability.  Because a \nstatute only “abrogate[s] a common-law principle” when it “speak[s] directly to the question \naddressed by the common law,” the Court held that “when Congress creates a tort action, it \nlegislates against a legal background of ordinary tort-related vicarious liability rules and \nconsequently intends its legislation to incorporate those rules.”  Meyer, 537 U.S. at 285 (internal \nquotation marks omitted).   \nCourts have applied this interpretive principle in numerous other contexts as well.  For \ninstance, in Norfolk Redevelopment & Hous. Auth. v. Chesapeake & Potomac Tel. Co. of Va., \n464 U.S. 30, 32 (1983), a utility company sought to recover the cost of relocating its facilities \nbased on a federally-funded project under the Uniform Relocation Act, which entitled any \n“displaced person” to such relocation benefits.  Though the Court expressed “no doubt” that the \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 6   Filed 04/29/19   Page 20 of 28\n \nutility company qualified as a “displaced person” under the statute’s text, it held that the statute \ndid not expressly abrogate the “traditional common law rule [that] utilities have been required to \nbear the entire cost of relocating from a public right-of-way whenever requested to do so by state \nor local authorities.”  Id. at 35-36 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  Relying on \nthe “well-established principle of statutory construction that the common law ought not to be \ndeemed repealed, unless the language of a statute be clear and explicit for this purpose,” the \nCourt held that the utility was not entitled to recover—despite the facially broad statutory \nprovision.  Id. at 36; see also United States v. Bestfoods, 524 U.S. 51, 55, 63 (1998) (though \nCERLA only imposes liability on those who “owned or operated” a facility, it nevertheless \nincorporates the “well-settled” common-law rules regarding corporate veil piercing because a \nstatute only “abrogate[s] a common-law principle” if it “speak[s] directly to the question \naddressed by the common law”).   \nThis case presents a straightforward application of that well-settled interpretive principle.  \nThe INA is directly analogous to the statutes at issue in the cases discussed above:  Its two civil-\narrest provisions invoke a general common-law concept without specifying its precise scope.  \nSee 8 U.S.C. §§ 1226(a), 1357(a)(2).  Neither provision touches on where civil immigration \narrests are authorized, let alone “speak[s] directly” to an intention to abrogate the common-law \nrule that civil arrests cannot be carried out on those attending court.  Texas, 507 U.S. at 534.  The \nhistory of these civil-arrest provisions similarly suggests no intent to grant authority exceeding \nthat at common law.  Both of these provisions were initially adopted in the Immigration and \nNationality Act of 1952 §§ 242(a), 287(a)(2), Pub. L. 82-414, 66 Stat. 163, 208-209, 233, and \nhave not been substantively revised since that time, see 8 U.S.C. §§ 1226(a), 1357(a)(2).  Neither \nthe legislative history of the 1952 Act, nor the history of subsequent acts that made non-\n13 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 6   Filed 04/29/19   Page 21 of 28\n \nsubstantive amendments to these provisions, include any relevant discussion of the civil-arrest \nprovisions.  Absent any indication of Congressional intent, the statute does not grant the full \nscope of civil-arrest authority Congress could constitutionally authorize, but instead simply \ngrants a civil-arrest authority commensurate with the scope of that authority at common law.  \nAnd, as discussed above, the government’s common-law civil-arrest authority did not include the \npower to arrest victims, witnesses, and parties attending court.   \nBecause ICE’s civil-arrest authority is limited to the government’s authority at common \nlaw, and because ICE’s Directive authorizes the very civil arrests that are prohibited at common \nlaw, ICE’s Directive exceeds its statutory authority, and must be set aside. \nB.  Finding abrogation would be particularly inappropriate given the \nsignificant constitutional concerns raised by ICE’s Directive. \nTo the extent there is any ambiguity as to whether the INA abrogates the common-law \nprivilege against civil arrest, the canon of constitutional avoidance resolves it.  See, e.g., Clark v. \nMartinez, 543 U.S. 371, 380-82 (2005).  Under that canon, when there are “competing plausible \ninterpretations of a statutory text,” courts should apply “the reasonable presumption that \nCongress did not intend the alternative which raises serious constitutional doubts.”  Id. at 381.  \nInterpreting the INA to authorize civil courthouse arrests—effectively conditioning appearance \nin court on the risk of ICE arrest and detention—would create at least three significant \n“constitutional doubts” that reinforce the need to interpret ICE’s civil-arrest authority as limited \nby the common-law privilege against civil courthouse arrests.   \nFirst, abrogating the common-law privilege implicates the constitutional right of access to \nthe courts, which prohibits “systemic official action [that] frustrates a plaintiff or plaintiff class \nin preparing and filing suits.”  Christopher v. Harbury, 536 U.S. 403, 413, 415 & n.12 (2002); \nsee also Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 522-23 (2004); Simmons v. Dickhaut, 804 F.2d 182, \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 6   Filed 04/29/19   Page 22 of 28\n \n183 (1st Cir. 1986).  Such “frustrat[ion]” includes not only policies that ban access outright, but \nalso those that obstruct it by, for instance, imposing significant filing fees, Christopher, 536 U.S. \nat 413 (citing M.L.B. v. S.L.J., 519 U.S. 102, 106-07 (1996)), or making courts inaccessible to \nthose with disabilities, Lane, 541 U.S. at 522-23.  Forcing noncitizen litigants to risk civil arrest \nto access the courts creates such impermissible frustration.  Indeed, the cases establishing the \ncommon-law privilege recognized precisely this, explaining that the fear of arrest would \n“prevent [parties and witnesses’] approach,” obstructing “the administration of justice.”  Halsey, \n4 N.L.J. at 367-68.  The impact of ICE’s Directive has vindicated this common-law wisdom:  \nNoncitizen victims of domestic violence and landlord and employer abuse have been forced to \ncontinue to suffer abuse rather than risk ICE arrest, and Plaintiff Chelsea Collaborative has been \nforced to establish its own extra-judicial mediation program to attempt to resolve disputes \nbetween those who are no longer willing to attend court.  See Vega Decl. ¶¶ 12-20. \nSecond, abrogating the privilege would likely deprive criminal defendants of their Sixth \nAmendment rights.  A “fundamental element of due process of law” is criminal defendants’ \n“right to present a defense,” which includes the “right to offer the testimony of witnesses, and to \ncompel their attendance, if necessary.”  Washington v. Texas, 388 U.S. 14, 19 (1967).  \nGovernment acts that “cause[] the loss or erosion” of favorable testimony violate that right.  \nUnited States v. Hoffman, 832 F.2d 1299, 1303 (1st Cir. 1987).  By conditioning court \nappearance on potential civil arrest, ICE’s Directive threatens noncitizen witnesses with potential \narrest upon appearance in court, likely depriving many criminal defendants of key testimony.  \nCriminal defendants also have the right to testify on their own behalf, e.g., Rock v. Arkansas, 483 \nU.S. 44, 51-53 (1987), and to be present at crucial phases of the trial, e.g., Illinois v. Allen, 397 \nU.S. 337, 338 (1970).  ICE’s Directive impermissibly conditions a criminal defendant’s exercise \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 6   Filed 04/29/19   Page 23 of 28\n \nof these rights on exposing herself to potential civil immigration arrest—and, if the defendant is \ncivilly arrested and detained, often denies those rights completely.  See Klein Decl. ¶¶ 7, 10. \nThird, the Directive raises significant federalism and Tenth Amendment concerns, which \nfurther caution against reading the INA to abrogate the common-law privilege.  Because “States \nretain substantial sovereign powers under our constitutional scheme, powers with which \nCongress does not readily interfere,” when Congress intends to “pre-empt the historic powers of \nthe States,” it must do so “plain[ly],” making its intention “unmistakably clear.”  Gregory v. \nAshcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 460-61 (1991).  There can be little doubt that it “pre-empt[s] the historic \npowers of the States” to install ICE agents in state courts to civilly arrest victims, witnesses, and \nparties attempting to access those courts.  Indeed, ICE’s Directive flies in the face of settled \nMassachusetts law prohibiting such civil courthouse arrests specifically because such a \nprohibition is necessary for the Massachusetts justice system to function.  See Valley Bank, 237 \nN.E.2d at 679 (recognizing that the privilege “is a prerogative exerted by the sovereign power \nthrough the courts for the furtherance of the ends of justice”).  The Directive also intrudes on the \nCommonwealth’s police power—a power “the Founders denied the National Government and \nreposed in the States,” United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598, 618 (2000)—as the Directive \ninterferes with the ability to investigate and prosecute crime.  See Foley Decl. ¶¶ 4-6; Vega Decl. \n¶¶ 10-11, 16.  Nothing in the INA suggests an intent to allow such intrusion into state judicial \nand police powers—and the INA certainly does not do so “plain[ly]” and “unmistakably.” \nIndeed, even if the INA did include a plain and unmistakable indication of intent to use \nstate courts for purposes of civil immigration arrests, such conduct would likely violate the Tenth \nAmendment.  The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the federal government cannot \ncommandeer state resources, and cannot “compel the States to implement, by legislation or \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 6   Filed 04/29/19   Page 24 of 28\n \nexecutive action, federal regulatory programs.”  Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 925 \n(1997); see also Murphy v. Nat’l Collegiate Athletic Ass’n, 138 S. Ct. 1461 (2018).  Thus, the \nfederal government could not force the District Attorneys, CPCS, or state courts to identify to \nICE every defendant, witness, or party they know will be appearing in state court, let alone make \nany such person available for ICE arrest.  See Murphy, 138 S. Ct. at 1477.  ICE’s Directive is \nfunctionally equivalent—though it does not explicitly order the state government to provide this \ninformation, it installs federal officers in state courts to simply extract it, in violation of state law.  \nCf. id. at 1478 (barring state legislature from doing something is “as if federal officers were \ninstalled in state legislative chambers and were armed with the authority to stop legislators from \nvoting on any offending proposals.  A more direct affront to state sovereignty is not easy to \nimagine.”).  Further, ICE’s Directive raises precisely the concerns around federal shifting of \npolitical accountability and costs to the states that underlie the anti-commandeering principle.  \nSee id. at 1477.  This Court should not permit such an end-run around established Tenth \nAmendment law. \nBecause the INA does not abrogate the common-law rule against civil courthouse arrests, \nand because any such abrogation would raise serious constitutional doubts, Plaintiffs are likely to \nestablish that ICE’s Directive exceeds its statutory authority, and must be set aside.  \n  ICE’s Directive is causing Plaintiffs ongoing and irreparable harm. \nICE’s Directive is inflicting ongoing harm on Plaintiffs—harm that is irreparable, as it \n“cannot adequately be compensated for either by a later-issued permanent injunction, after a full \nadjudication on the merits, or by a later-issued damages remedy.”  Rio Grande Cmty. Health \nCtr., Inc. v. Rullan, 397 F.3d 56, 76 (1st Cir. 2005).  This includes financial harm from the need \nto expend significant additional resources in response to ICE’s Directive—harm that is \nunrecoverable given the government’s sovereign immunity.  Odebrecht Construction, Inc. v. \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 6   Filed 04/29/19   Page 25 of 28\n \nSec’y, Fla. Dep’t of Transp., 715 F.3d 1268, 1289 (11th Cir. 2013) (citing cases).  And it also \nincludes harm that is, by its very nature, irreparable, such as lost opportunities for prosecution. \nChelsea Collaborative—a non-profit membership-based organization—is suffering \nirreparable harm in at least two different ways.  First, it has had to divert significant resources \nresponding to ICE’s unauthorized Directive.  Most notably, because many of its members and \nothers in the Chelsea community are noncitizens who are not willing to use the Massachusetts \ncourts to resolve their disputes because of ICE’s Directive, Chelsea Collaborative has been \nforced to establish, at significant expense, an extra-judicial mediation and dispute-resolution \nsystem to attempt to resolve disputes between those unwilling to appear in court.  Vega Decl. ¶¶ \n17-20.  Chelsea Collaborative is currently conducting three to four mediations per week.  Id.  \nThis is a program that had never been needed prior to ICE’s civil-courthouse-arrest policy.  Id.  \nSecond, Chelsea Collaborative’s members have been unable to vindicate important rights, \nsuffering ongoing domestic violence, unpaid wages, and other legal violations against them due \nto the risk that an attempt to vindicate their rights would lead to civil arrest by ICE.6  Id. ¶¶ 12-\n16.  This not only harms Chelsea Collaborative’s members, but also the Collaborative itself, as it \nprevents the Collaborative from fulfilling its mission of protecting its members’ rights. \nThe District Attorneys are also suffering ongoing and irreparable harm in multiple, \npredictable ways.  ICE’s civil-courthouse-arrest policy has increased noncitizen victims’ and \nwitnesses’ fear of reporting crime and appearing in court.  Vega Decl. ¶¶ 10-11, 13; Espinoza \nDecl. ¶ 7.  It has also made it impossible for the District Attorneys and their staff to tell \npotentially removable noncitizen victims and witnesses that their fears of civil ICE arrest upon \nappearing in court are unfounded given that the Directive specifically authorizes their arrest.  \n                                                 \n6 Courts consider irreparable harm to a plaintiff’s members in the preliminary-injunction inquiry.  E.g., Sierra Club \nv. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 645 F.3d 978, 996 (8th Cir. 2011). \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 6   Filed 04/29/19   Page 26 of 28\n \nFoley Decl. ¶¶ 4-6.  This leads to an inability to prosecute certain cases at all when the victims \nand witnesses refuse to come forward.  Vega Decl. ¶¶ 10-11, 13; Moshier Decl. ¶¶ 3-4.  Finally, \nthe threat of ICE arrests often leads defendants to not appear for fear of ICE arrest, which \nprevents the District Attorneys from completing prosecutions, and victims from having their day \nin court.  Klein Decl. ¶¶ 7, 10.  It also leads to additional resource diversion, as Assistant District \nAttorneys are forced to prepare for trials that do not occur.   \nCPCS has suffered and will continue to suffer similar irreparable harm during the \npendency of this suit.  CPCS’s three-person Immigration Impact Unit (“IIU”) is tasked with \nadvising all Massachusetts court-appointed criminal defense attorneys concerning the \nimmigration consequences of criminal convictions to ensure effective representation under \nPadilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356 (2010).  Klein Decl. ¶¶ 2-3.  But since ICE’s policy took \neffect, IIU staff have been forced to devote considerable resources to addressing defense \nattorneys’ concerns about the problems caused by potential ICE arrest, assisting defense \nattorneys in locating their clients who have been arrested and civilly detained by ICE and \nassisting those attorneys in securing their clients’ appearances in court, distracting IIU staff from \ntheir core responsibility of ensuring effective assistance of counsel.  Id. ¶¶ 12-14.  Criminal \ndefendants’ increased failure to appear at hearings and trials—whether out of fear of ICE arrest \nor because they were actually arrested by ICE upon appearing in court—also creates significant \nharm to CPCS, forcing its attorneys to prepare for hearings and trials that do not take place, and \nmaking it impossible for CPCS to carry out its criminal-defense responsibilities.  Id. ¶¶ 11,13.   \n  The public interest and the balance of harms weigh strongly in favor of preliminary \ninjunctive relief. \nThe final two factors generally “merge when the Government is the opposing party.”  \nNken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009).  Here, the public interest strongly favors preliminary \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 6   Filed 04/29/19   Page 27 of 28\n \ninjunctive relief, as ICE’s Directive not only harms Plaintiffs, but also the public at large.  First, \nas to the specific policy at issue, tens of thousands of Massachusetts residents are potentially \nsubject to civil ICE arrest, and are currently forced to risk such arrest as a condition for accessing \nthe court system.  That impacts not only those individuals and their families, but also safety and \nthe rule of law more generally.  When crime goes unreported, or when victims’ or witnesses’ \nunwillingness to appear in court makes prosecution impossible, criminals are not punished and \nremain at large.  Indeed criminals often use the threat of ICE arrest to deter victims and witnesses \nfrom reporting the crimes—an issue that is a particular problem in the context of domestic \nviolence.  See Foley Decl. ¶ 5; Moshier Decl. ¶¶ 3, 6.  Second, and more generally, “the public \ninterest is best served by having federal agencies comply with the requirements of federal law.”  \nPatriot, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Hous. & Urban Dev., 963 F. Supp. 1, 6 (D.D.C. 1997). \nNo countervailing government interest in conducting civil arrests at courthouses \noutweighs the ongoing and irreparable harm being caused to Plaintiffs and the public.  Plaintiffs \nseek only an injunction limiting where ICE can carry out operations—it does not seek to limit, in \nany way, who ICE can arrest, let alone who ICE can seek to remove.  The fact that the federal \ngovernment will have to use its own resources to identify and arrest these individuals—rather \nthan simply commandeering state resources—weighs in favor, not against, an injunction.  \n \nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should enjoin Defendants from implementing ICE’s Directive, and from \narresting individuals attending court on official business, during the pendency of this suit.    \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11003-PBS   Document 6   Filed 04/29/19   Page 28 of 28\n \nDated: April 29, 2019  Respectfully submitted, \n   \n/s/ David J.
