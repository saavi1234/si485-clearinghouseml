    "summary": "<p>On August 2, 2018, various cities and city officials across the country and one married couple from Charlottesville, Virginia, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland against Donald J. Trump (in his official capacity as President of the United States), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, alleging violations of the Administrative Procedure Act and Take Care Clause regarding various executive actions related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA). </p><p>Specifically, Plaintiffs alleged that a final rule promulgated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in April 2018 undermined many of the ACA’s safeguards and requirements. Plaintiffs also pointed to a variety of other executive actions they claim demonstrate Defendants’ violation of their constitutional duty to faithfully execute the ACA. Plaintiffs are represented by their respective legal departments and Democracy Forward Foundation. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin the rule and other executive behaviors, as well as an order for Defendants to take various steps to comply with their constitutional obligation to take care to faithfully execute the ACA. They also request costs and attorney’s fees. This case was assigned to Judge Deborah K. Chasanow. </p><p>Plaintiffs include cities (and/or city officials) from Columbus, Ohio; Baltimore, Maryland; Cincinnati, Ohio; Chicago, Illinois; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (added through an amended complaint filed January 25, 2019); and a married couple who resides in Charlottesville, Virginia. They alleged that the Final Rule would eliminate protections guaranteed by the ACA, deter Americans from enrolling in quality health insurance plans, and drive up insurance costs. They further alleged that the Executive branch has directed agencies to “sabotage” the ACA, committed various actions in an attempt to destabilize the exchanges, has strategically worked to decrease enrollment, has arbitrarily driven up premiums, and has refused to defend the ACA. They claim that these actions have caused premiums to rise and the uninsured to increase, harming Government Plaintiffs by forcing them to spend more on uncompensated care. They also alleged that Defendant’s actions harm Individual Plaintiffs by making insurance coverage harder and more expensive to procure. The complaint stated two causes of action, first under the Administrative Procedure Act (alleging that the Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious) and second under the Take Care clause (U.S. Const. Art. II, § 3). </p><p>After the complaint was initially filed in August 2018, the court granted Defendants two time extensions to respond. On December 25, 2018, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. On January 25, 2019, Plaintiffs amended their complaint, adding Philadelphia as a plaintiff and including recent executive actions that allegedly constitute part of a systematic attack on health law. Defendants were granted three additional time extensions to respond to Plaintiff’s complaint in January and February, 2019, then they filed an updated motion to dismiss. Plaintiffs filed a memo in opposition to the motion to dismiss in June, and the U.S. House of Representatives along with thirteen counties and cities filed amicus \"friend-of-the-court\" briefs in support of plaintiffs. </p><p>On April 10, 2020, Judge Chasanow granted the defendants' motion in part and denied it in part. 453 F. Supp. 3d 770. After finding that the plaintiff's claims were justiciable, Judge Chasanow denied the motion to dismiss for the APA claims because the record was not sufficient to evaluate that claim, but granted the defendants' motion for the Take Care claim because \"judicial intervention here would impinge on the discretion that Congress has afforded to the President.\"</p><p>Three days later, the defendants moved for summary judgment. As of January 21, 2021, the case remains ongoing.</p>",

In 2010, the \nHouse passed the Affordable Care Act after significant study into the problems with then-existing \nhealth insurance markets, and the House is thus particularly well suited to explain to the Court why \nCongress enacted this landmark legislation and how it has helped ensure that all Americans, \nincluding those with preexisting conditions, have access to quality, affordable health insurance.  \nDuring the 116th Congress, the House has held multiple hearings on actions taken by President \nTrump and his Administration that threaten to undermine the benefits and protections provided by \nthe Act, and thus amicus also has unique knowledge about, and a strong interest in, the question \nwhether the Trump Administration’s actions are consistent with the plan that Congress put in place \nwhen it passed the Affordable Care Act.   \nINTRODUCTION \nIn 2010, Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, a landmark law that sought to achieve \n“near-universal  coverage,”  42  U.S.C.  § 18091(2)(D),  by  making  quality,  affordable  health \n                                                 \n1 No person or entity other than amicus and its counsel assisted in or made a monetary \ncontribution to the preparation or submission of this brief. \n2  The  Bipartisan  Legal  Advisory  Group  (BLAG)  of  the  United  States  House  of \nRepresentatives has authorized the filing of an amicus brief in this matter.  The BLAG comprises \nthe Honorable Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House, the Honorable Steny H. Hoyer, Majority \nLeader, the  Honorable  James E. Clyburn, Majority Whip, the  Honorable Kevin McCarthy, \nRepublican Leader, and the Honorable Steve Scalise, Republican Whip, and “speaks for, and \narticulates the institutional position of, the House in all litigation matters.”  Rules of the U.S. House \nof  Representatives  (116th  Cong.),  Rule  II.8(b),  available  at \nhttps://tinyurl.com/HouseRules116thCong.    The  Republican  Leader  and  Republican  Whip \ndissented. \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 65-1   Filed 06/07/19   Page 8 of 22\ninsurance available to all Americans.  When Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, it was \nresponding to serious problems affecting America’s insurance and health care systems.  Many \nemployers failed to offer coverage to their employees, and only a limited number of individuals \nwere eligible for government health insurance programs like Medicaid.  Moreover, those who \ncould not obtain coverage through their employer or Medicaid were forced to try their luck in the \nindividual marketplace.  That marketplace was plagued with sky-high prices, care that was not \ncomprehensive, and discriminatory practices that prevented millions of Americans from obtaining \ncoverage.  As a result, one-seventh of the American population lacked health insurance.   \nIn response to these systemic flaws, Congress passed the Affordable Care Act “to increase \nthe number of Americans covered by health insurance and decrease the cost of health care.”  Nat’l \nFed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius (NFIB), 567 U.S. 519, 538 (2012) (opinion of Roberts, C.J.).  The \nlaw thus includes a number of provisions designed to expand access to health insurance to as many \nAmericans as possible.  First, it expands Medicaid to all low-income individuals.  Second, it \nprevents insurers from discriminating on the basis of preexisting conditions, and includes a number \nof other protections designed to ensure that insurers offer comprehensive care to a wide swath of \nconsumers.  Third, it creates a system of American Health Benefit Exchanges (“Exchanges”) \nwhereby individuals who do not receive health insurance through their employer or through \nMedicaid can easily compare and purchase health insurance in the individual marketplace, and it \nprovides tax credits to subsidize the cost of insurance for many lower- and middle-income \nindividuals.    Finally,  the  Act  includes  many  provisions  designed  to  assist  individuals  with \nobtaining coverage on the Exchanges.  These various provisions were all designed with one \nprimary goal in mind: to reduce the number of Americans who do not have access to quality, \naffordable coverage. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 65-1   Filed 06/07/19   Page 9 of 22\nOver the last two years, the Trump Administration has repeatedly taken steps to undermine \nCongress’s goal of expanding coverage.  For instance, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices  recently  promulgated  a  Rule  that  ends  the  requirement  that  Exchanges  provide \n“standardized options,” which make it easier for consumers to compare plans and more likely that \nthey will purchase insurance.  See Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters for 2019, 83 Fed. \nReg.  16,930,  16,974-75  (Apr.  17,  2018).    That  same  Rule  also  ends  the  requirement  that \nNavigators—entities  that  assist  individuals  with  signing  up  for  insurance—have  a  physical \npresence in the area they serve, seriously undermining their effectiveness.  The Administration has \nalso taken steps designed to reduce enrollment on the Exchanges.  The Administration has, among \nmany  other  things,  shortened  the  open  enrollment  period,  drastically  reduced  funding  for \nadvertisements to educate consumers about the Exchanges, cut funding for Navigators, and failed \nto set numeric enrollment targets.  Through all of these actions, the Administration has undermined \nthe Affordable Care Act, and it has harmed the millions of Americans who depend on the Act to \naccess quality, affordable health insurance. \nARGUMENT \nTHE  AFFORDABLE  CARE  ACT  WAS  DESIGNED  TO  EXPAND  HEALTH  CARE \nBENEFITS AND PROTECTIONS, YET THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE \nSIGNIFICANT EFFORTS TO UNDERMINE THAT GOAL.  \nA.  The Affordable Care Act Responded to Serious Problems in America’s Health Care \nSystem That Had Left Millions Without Quality, Affordable Insurance.  \nCongress  passed  the Affordable  Care Act  in  response  to  serious  problems  plaguing \nAmerica’s health care system.  See H.R. Rep. No. 111-299, Pt. 3, at 55 (2009) (“The U.S. health \ncare system is on an unsustainable course.”).  In 2007, “more than 45.7 million people were \nuninsured . . . , representing more than one-seventh of the population.”  H.R. Rep. No. 111-299, \nPt. 1, at 320 (2009).  This uninsured rate was caused by a number of different factors.  First, while \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 65-1   Filed 06/07/19   Page 10 of 22\nalmost all large employers offered their employees health insurance benefits, “[l]ess than half of \nall  small  employers  (less  than  50  employees)  offer[ed]  health  insurance  coverage  to  their \nemployees.”  Id. at 322.  Indeed, there was “no federal requirement that employers offer health \ninsurance coverage to employees or their families.”  H.R. Rep. No. 111-299, Pt. 3, at 134.   \nSecond,  at  the  time  the  Affordable  Care  Act  was  passed,  health  care  costs  were \nskyrocketing, making it difficult for most Americans to purchase their own insurance in the \nindividual marketplace.  “Between 1999 and 2008, health insurance premiums more than doubled \nas wages largely stagnated.”  Id. at 55-56 (citing testimony of Jacob Hacker).3  On top of that, the \nUnited States “spen[t] substantially more than other developed countries on health care, both per \ncapita and as a share of GDP.”  H.R. Rep. No. 111-299, Pt. 1, at 320.  This dramatic increase in \nhealth care costs affected employers—who “face[d] a growing challenge paying for health benefits \nwhile managing labor costs to succeed in a competitive market,” id.—and federal and state \nbudgets—“both directly, through spending on Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs, and \nindirectly, through tax expenditures for health insurance and expenses,” id. at 320-21.   \nThird,  insurance  companies  in  many  States  were  permitted  to  discriminate  against \nindividuals with preexisting conditions.  Because “‘20 percent of the population account[ed] for \n80  percent  of  health  spending’”  in  2009,  “health  insurers—particularly  in  the  individual \nmarket— . . . adopted discriminatory, but not illegal, practices to cherry-pick healthy people and \nto weed out those who [we]re not as healthy.”  H.R. Rep. No. 111-299, Pt. 3, at 92 (quoting \ntestimony of Karen Pollitz).  Such practices included: “denying health coverage based on pre-\n                                                 \n3 See David Blumenthal & Sara Collins, Where Both the ACA and AHCA Fall Short, and \nWhat  the  Health  Insurance  Market  Really  Needs,  Harv.  Bus.  Rev.

As a result of these practices, \n“many uninsured Americans—ranging from 9 million to 12.6 million—voluntarily sought health \ncoverage in the individual market but were denied coverage, charged a higher premium, or offered \nonly limited coverage that excludes a preexisting condition.”  Fla. ex rel. Atty. Gen. v. U.S. Dep’t \nof Health & Human Servs., 648 F.3d 1235, 1245 (11th Cir. 2011), aff’d in part, rev’d in part by \nNFIB, 567 U.S. 519.  Congress found that “[d]iscrimination based on health, gender and other \nfactors has severe economic consequences for those who have been unable to find affordable health \ncoverage and for those who have coverage, but are under-insured.”  H.R. Rep. No. 111-299, Pt. 3, \nat 92.  \nFinally,  millions  of  Americans  who  were  not  provided  insurance  benefits  by  their \nemployers and could not afford or were denied coverage in the individual market were also \nineligible  for  insurance  through  government  programs  like  Medicaid.    Indeed,  at  the time, \nMedicaid offered federal funding to States only “to assist pregnant women, children, needy \nfamilies, the blind, the elderly, and the disabled in obtaining medical care.”  NFIB, 567 U.S. at 541 \n(citing 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)). \nB.  Congress Passed the Affordable Care Act To Expand Access to Quality, Affordable \nHealth Insurance, and the Act’s Reforms Have Been Remarkably Successful. \nIn light of these serious and systemic problems that had resulted in millions of Americans \nwho could not access quality, affordable health insurance, Congress passed the Affordable Care \nAct “to expand coverage” while keeping health care costs in check.  King v. Burwell, 135 S. Ct. \n2480, 2485 (2015); see NFIB, 567 U.S. at 538 (“The Act aims to increase the number of Americans \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 65-1   Filed 06/07/19   Page 12 of 22\ncovered by health insurance and decrease the cost of health care.”); 42 U.S.C. § 18091(2)(D) (the \nAct aims to achieve “near-universal coverage”).  It does so in three primary ways.  First, the Act \nexpands Medicaid to provide funding to States to provide coverage to all individuals earning up to \n133% of the federal poverty level.  See id. § 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII).  This expansion was \nestimated to provide coverage to millions of Americans.  See CBO’s Analysis of the Major Health \nCare Legislation Enacted in Mar. 2010 Before the H. Subcomm. on Health of the Comm. on Energy \n& Com., 112th Cong. 22-23 (Mar. 30, 2011) (statement of Douglas Elmendorf, Director, Cong. \nBudget Office).  \nSecond, the Act includes various market reforms designed to expand access to insurance \ncoverage.  For instance, the Act requires large employers to offer insurance to their employees or \npay a penalty, 26 U.S.C. § 4980H; to automatically enroll new and current employees of large \nemployers in an employer-sponsored plan unless an employee opts out, 29 U.S.C. § 218a; and to \noffer adequate health insurance plans, 26 U.S.C. § 4980H(a).  The Act also includes numerous \nother important provisions that, for example, prohibit insurers from imposing lifetime dollar limits \non the value of coverage, 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-11; prohibit insurers from rescinding coverage except \nin the case of fraud, id. § 300gg-12; require individual and group health plans to cover preventive \nservices without cost sharing, id. § 300gg-13; and allow children to stay on their parents’ health \ninsurance until age 26, id. § 300gg-14.   \nThe Act further addresses the inadequacy of benefits in the individual and small group \nmarkets by expressly providing that insurance offered in those markets must include “essential \nhealth benefits.”  42 U.S.C. § 300gg-6(a) (“A health insurance issuer that offers health insurance \ncoverage in the individual or small group market shall ensure that such coverage includes the \nessential health benefits package required under section 18022(a) of this title.”).  While the law \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 65-1   Filed 06/07/19   Page 13 of 22\ngave the Secretary of Health and Human Services authority to define what those “essential health \nbenefits” would be, the law specified that “such benefits shall include at least the following general \ncategories”:  ambulatory  patient  services,  emergency  services,  hospitalization,  maternity  and \nnewborn  care,  mental  health  and  substance  abuse  disorder  services,  prescription  drugs, \nrehabilitative and habilitative services, laboratory services, preventive and wellness services and \nchronic  disease  management,  and  pediatric  services,  including  oral  and  vision  care.    Id. \n§ 18022(b)(1).    All  of  these  reforms  were  designed  to  allow  more  Americans  access  to \ncomprehensive insurance coverage. \nThird, the Act includes reforms that ensure that no American is denied the ability to \npurchase health insurance.  The Act prevents discrimination on the basis of preexisting conditions \nby including a guaranteed-issue provision prohibiting insurers from denying coverage to any \nindividual because of a medical condition or their medical history, see id. §§ 300gg-1, 300gg-3, \n300gg-4, and a community-rating provision prohibiting insurers from charging higher premiums \nbecause of an individual’s preexisting medical conditions, id. §§ 300gg(a), 300gg-4(b).   \nFinally, for individuals who are not eligible for Medicaid and do not receive insurance from \ntheir employer, the Act provides for the creation of Exchanges through which individuals can \npurchase health insurance for themselves and their families.  The Act “requires the creation of an \n‘Exchange’ in each State where people can shop for insurance, usually online.”  King, 135 S. Ct. \nat 2487 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 18031(b)(1)).  Generally, States were tasked with setting up these \nExchanges, see 42 U.S.C. § 18031(b)(1), but if a State declined to do so, the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services was required to “establish and operate such Exchange within the State.”  Id. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 65-1   Filed 06/07/19   Page 14 of 22\n§ 18041(c)(1).4  The Act then “s[ought] to make insurance more affordable by giving refundable \ntax credits to individuals with household incomes between 100 percent and 400 percent of the \nfederal poverty line.”  King, 135 S. Ct. at 2487 (citing 26 U.S.C. § 36B).  “Individuals who meet \nthe Act’s requirements may purchase insurance with the tax credits, which are provided in advance \ndirectly to the individual’s insurer.”  Id. (citing 42 U.S.C. §§ 18081, 18082); see King v. Burwell, \n759 F.3d 358, 364 (4th Cir. 2014), aff’d by King, 135 S. Ct. 2480 (“The Exchanges facilitate this \nprocess by advancing an individual’s eligible tax credit dollars directly to health insurance \nproviders as a means of reducing the upfront cost of plans to consumers.”).  The Act also requires \ninsurers to reduce certain cost-sharing expenses—like deductibles and co-payments—for lower \nincome individuals, and requires the Department of Health and Human Services to reimburse \ninsurers for these cost-sharing reductions.  See 42 U.S.C. § 18071. \nThe existence of the Exchanges and tax credits for purchasing insurance is critical to \nCongress’s goal of expanding coverage: the Exchanges allow individuals to explore different \ninsurance plans for themselves and their families and to purchase insurance online, while the tax \ncredits  make  this  coverage  affordable  for  lower  income  Americans  who  are  ineligible  for \nMedicaid.    Moreover,  because  the  Exchanges  work  most  effectively  when  “[i]ndividual \nenrollment” is sufficiently high, and there is a “balanced risk pool,”5 the Act included a number of \ndifferent provisions to facilitate enrollment.  For example, the Act requires Exchanges to “provide \nfor the operation of a toll-free telephone hotline to respond to requests for assistance,” 42 U.S.C. \n§ 18031(d)(4)(B), and “an Internet website through which enrollees and prospective enrollees of \n                                                 \n4 As of 2018, 12 States operate State Exchanges, 28 States rely on the federal government \nto run their Exchanges, and 11 States have a hybrid Exchange of some sort.

The Secretary of Health and Human Services is tasked with “establish[ing] \nstandards for navigators . . . , including provisions to ensure that any private or public entity that \nis selected as a navigator is qualified, and licensed if appropriate, to engage in the navigator \nactivities.”  Id. § 18031(i)(4)(A). \nThese reforms are designed to fulfill Congress’s goal of expanding coverage and ensuring \nthat the coverage that individuals receive meets a baseline standard of comprehensiveness at a \nreasonable cost.  Every provision—from the expansion of Medicaid to millions of Americans, to \nthe establishment of Exchanges, to the creation of the Navigator system to assist individuals with \nobtaining coverage—was designed to fulfill that goal.  \nThe Act has been wildly successful in ameliorating the immense public health problem \ncaused  by  having  so  many  Americans  without  adequate  health  insurance.    As  of  2016, \napproximately 12.7 million more people had purchased plans in the individual market through the \nstate and federal Exchanges than before the Affordable Care Act was passed.  Namrata Uberio et \nal., Health Insurance Coverage and the Affordable Care Act, 2010-2016 at 8, Dep’t of Health & \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 65-1   Filed 06/07/19   Page 16 of 22\nHuman Servs. (Mar. 3, 2016), https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/pdf/187551/ACA2010-2016.pdf.  \nAnd approximately 14.5 million more people began receiving comprehensive benefits through \nMedicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).  Id.  Overall, there has been a net \ngain of 20 million Americans with health insurance coverage.   Id.  This gain spans many \ngenerational, ethnic, and racial groups, and has particularly benefited women, younger people, and \nBlack and Hispanic individuals.  Id. at 2.  \nC.  The Administration’s Various Actions Undermine the Affordable Care Act. \nDespite the success of the Affordable Care Act, the President and his Administration have \ntaken various actions to undermine the Act and thwart its achievement of the important public \nhealth goal of “near-universal coverage.”  42 U.S.C. § 18091(2)(D).  Those actions threaten to \nharm the millions of Americans who have benefited, and continue to benefit, from the Affordable \nCare Act’s benefits and protections.  Just a few examples suffice to show how the Administration \nhas repeatedly sought to undermine the Act. \nFirst, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) promulgated a final Rule \nthat undermines the Exchanges.  See Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters for 2019, 83 Fed. \nReg. 16,930 (Apr. 17, 2018).  As discussed earlier, Congress created Exchanges to improve access \nto health insurance for individuals who cannot obtain it through an employer or through a \ngovernment program like Medicaid.  Indeed, the very purpose of the Exchanges was to make it \neasy for individuals who could not otherwise obtain insurance to purchase it on the individual \nmarket and thereby bring in a broad pool of consumers.  Yet the CMS Rule makes it harder for \nindividuals to purchase insurance on the Exchanges.  For example, the Rule discontinues the \nrequirement that Exchanges provide “standardized options” for health care plans, which help \nconsumers understand the different levels of coverage and compare different plans within each \nlevel.  Id. at 16,974-75.  This change was promulgated despite the Department of Health and \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 65-1   Filed 06/07/19   Page 17 of 22\nHuman Services’ own prior findings that “[a]n excessive number of health plan options makes \nconsumers less likely to make any plan selection, more likely to make a selection that does not \nmatch their health needs, and more likely to make a selection that leaves them less satisfied.”  HHS \nNotice of Benefit and Payment Parameters for 2017, 80 Fed. Reg. 75,488, 75,542 (Dec. 2, 2015) \n(proposed rule).  \nThe Rule also eliminates the requirement that Navigators have physical presences in the \nareas they serve.  See 83 Fed. Reg. at 16,979-81.  This change reduces the effectiveness of the \nNavigator program.  The physical-presence requirement was previously imposed “so that face-to-\nface assistance can be provided to applicants and enrollees.”  Exchange and Insurance Market \nStandards for 2015 and Beyond, 79 Fed. Reg. 15,808, 15,832 (Mar. 21, 2014).  Indeed, numerous \nstudies have found that in-person assistance can make a big difference in improving rates of \nenrollment.6  Thus, as Plaintiffs allege, undoing these requirements would “dampen overall \nenrollment,  especially  among  vulnerable  populations,  and  thereby  increase  the  rate  of  the \nuninsured.”  Am. Compl. 43, ¶ 79.   \nSome of the Rule’s changes are more subtle, but will nonetheless reduce the effectiveness \nof the Exchanges.  For instance, the Rule permits Exchanges to deny tax credits without notice to \nindividuals who do not reconcile the amount of credit they receive in advance with the amount that \nshould be allowed on their tax returns.  83 Fed. Reg. at 16,982-85.  This change could reduce \nenrollment because “[t]he unexpected loss of this assistance would likely cause many if not most \n                                                 \n6 See, e.g., Adrian Garcia Mosqueira & Benjamin D. Sommers, Better Outreach Critical \nto  ACA  Enrollment,  Particularly  for  Latinos,  The  Commonwealth  Fund  (Jan.  14,  2016), \nhttp://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/blog/2016/jan/better-outreach-critical-to-aca-\nenrollment-particularly-for-latinos; Jennifer Tolbert et al., Connecting Consumers to Coverage: \nLessons Learned from Assisters for Successful Outreach and Enrollment 2 (Sept. 19, 2014), \nhttp://files.kff.org/attachment/connecting-consumers-to-coverage-issue-brief. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 65-1   Filed 06/07/19   Page 18 of 22\nindividuals to drop coverage entirely, especially since they will not know why they lost it or how \nto remedy their loss.”  Am. Compl. 33, ¶ 56.  Similarly, the Rule substantially scales back oversight \nof insurance brokers who assist individuals with signing up for insurance, despite evidence that \nthese brokers were often “committing fraud, signing up individuals without their knowledge or \nconsent, and using inaccurate calculators for [tax credit] eligibility.”  Id. at 37, ¶ 65.  This change \n“will increase the likelihood that consumers receive inaccurate information, thus decreasing \noverall enrollment and leading to a rise in the rate of the uninsured.”  Id. at 38, ¶ 68.   \nThis Administration has also taken other actions outside the Rule that undermine the law’s \npurpose of achieving near-universal coverage.  First, the Administration has reduced the open \nenrollment period on Exchanges—the period during which individuals can enroll in coverage—\nfrom 3 months to 1.5 months.  Market Stabilization, 82 Fed. Reg. 18,346, 18,353-55 (Apr. 18, \n2017); see 45 C.F.R. § 155.410(e) (2017).  As studies have recognized, reducing the enrollment \nperiod will reduce the number of enrollees.7   \nSecond, the Administration has drastically reduced funding for advertisements to educate \nconsumers about the Exchanges and their insurance options.  For instance, during open enrollment \nthat began in November of 2017, the Administration spent only $10 million, 90% less than the \nprevious year, on advertising.  Am. Compl. 78, ¶ 147.  However, Congressional hearings have \nmade clear that advertising is critical to successfully enrolling a broad base of consumers.  For \ninstance, at a recent hearing, one witness testified that a multi-year study conducted by CMS itself \n                                                 \n7 See, e.g., Paul R. Shafer et al., Television Advertising and Health Insurance Marketplace \nConsumer Engagement in Kentucky: A Natural Experiment, 20 J. Med. Internet Res. *1, *7 (2018) \n(finding that “shortening the open enrollment period from 90 to 45 days . . . could have further \nnegative consequences [for ACA enrollment],” particularly as the new period is dominated by the \nThanksgiving week, which sees “large drops in [enrollment] activity”). \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 65-1   Filed 06/07/19   Page 19 of 22\n“demonstrated the causal relationship between advertising and enrollment.”8  And another testified \nthat  “insurers  increased  premiums  due  to  the  Trump  Administration’s  decision  to  decrease \nspending on marketplace advertising and consumer assistance.”9  The research confirms this \ntestimony.10   \nThird, the Administration has cut funding for Navigators to one-sixth the amount of \nfunding previously provided.  Am. Compl. 87, ¶ 165.  These funding cuts resulted in many \nNavigator organizations declining their awards and withdrawing from the program.  U.S. Gov’t \nAccountability Office, GAO-18-565, Health Insurance Exchanges: HHS Should Enhance Its \nOversight of Open Enrollment Performance 30 (July 2018) (“GAO Study”).  As numerous studies \nhave pointed out, however, Navigator programs and similar application assistance initiatives are \ncentral to encouraging enrollment for low-income adults, and their reduction will have detrimental \neffects on overall enrollment and equity.11   \n                                                 \n8  Congressional  Oversight  Hearing  on  the  Impact  of  the  Administration’s  Policies \nAffecting the Affordable Care Act Before the H.

Sommers et al., The Impact of State Policies on ACA Applications and \nEnrollment Among Low-Income Adults in Arkansas, Kentucky, and Texas, 34 Health Affairs 1010, \n \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 65-1   Filed 06/07/19   Page 20 of 22\nAnd fourth, the Administration has failed to set numeric enrollment targets for 2018 and \n2019.  In prior years, the Department of Health and Human Services “used numeric targets to \nmonitor enrollment progress during the open enrollment period and focus its resources on those \nconsumers that it believed had a high potential to enroll in exchange coverage.”  GAO Study at \n32.  The Department failed to set such targets in 2018.  Id.  The Government Accountability Office \nfound that “the lack of numeric enrollment targets for [the Department] to evaluate its performance \nwith respect to the open enrollment period hamper[ed] the agency’s ability to make informed \ndecisions about its resources.”  Id. at 37. \nIn other words, in myriad ways, this Administration has tried to make it more difficult for \nindividuals who need health insurance to access it through the Exchanges, even though Congress \npassed the Affordable Care Act to accomplish the opposite goal.  When Congress passed the \nAffordable Care Act, it recognized that systemic problems in the health insurance markets meant \nthat  many  Americans  were  denied  critically  important  health  insurance,  and  it  passed  the \nAffordable Care Act to put in place reforms to fix that.  Among other things, Congress wanted to \nensure  that  Americans  who  were  not  provided  insurance  by  their  employer  or  through  a \ngovernment program could easily go on an Exchange and purchase the best insurance option for \nthemselves and their families.

\nPlaintiffs the City of Columbus, Ohio, the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, \nMaryland, the City of Cincinnati, Ohio, the City of Chicago, Illinois, Stephen Vondra, and \nBonnie Morgan hereby sue Defendants Donald J. Trump, in his official capacity as President of \nthe United States of America, Alex M. Azar, II, in his official capacity as Secretary of the United \nStates Department of Health and Human Services, the United States Department of Health and \nHuman Services, Seema Verma, in her official capacity as Administrator of the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and \nallege as follows: \n1.  Having failed to persuade Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act, President \nTrump and his Administration are waging a relentless campaign to sabotage and, ultimately, to \nnullify the law. President Trump has repeatedly admitted as much: because Congress rejected his \ndemand to have “Obamacare repealed,” he has said, he decided “to go a different route” and \n“end[] Obamacare” through his own actions. To that end, President Trump and his \nAdministration are deliberately trying to make the Act fail. They are discouraging Americans \nfrom enrolling in comprehensive plans that protect them against debilitating medical expenses. \nThey are working to raise prices and reduce choices for Americans seeking insurance in the \nAct’s exchanges. And they are misappropriating funds Congress allocated to support the Act, \ninstead using those funds to attack it. The Trump Administration’s strategy: to deceptively shift \nthe blame from their own actions to the Act itself. Their objective: to pressure Congress to repeal \nthe Act or, if that fails, to achieve de facto repeal through executive action alone. The \nAdministration’s actions are unlawful. \n2.  The scope of this Complaint is testament to the breadth and persistence of the \nTrump Administration’s efforts to undermine the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”). As Plaintiffs—\n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 6 of 134\n \nindividuals and cities representing almost 4.5 million Americans—allege in detail below, the \nAdministration has tried to prevent families from obtaining health insurance through the ACA’s \nexchanges by, for example: \n  promoting insurance that does not comply with the ACA’s requirements, including \ninsurance that does not cover preexisting conditions; \n  slashing funding for outreach strategies that have been proven to encourage \nindividuals, and healthy individuals in particular, to sign up for coverage; \n  misusing federal funds for advertising campaigns aimed at smearing the ACA and its \nexchanges, and spinning false narratives about the efficacy and success of the Act; \n  providing individuals and families with less time to choose a plan that is appropriate \nfor them; and \n  imposing unnecessary and onerous documentation requirements, making enrollment \neven harder. \nIn addition, the Administration has worked to increase premiums for ACA-compliant insurance \nby, for example, shirking oversight of insurance rate increases and reducing rebates owed to \nconsumers when insurers underperform. Finally, the Administration has attempted to make \naffordable, high-quality health insurance unavailable by sowing uncertainty in insurance \nmarkets, causing insurers to raise rates or exit markets altogether. \n3.  President Trump and his Administration have been remarkably transparent about \ntheir intent and their approach. “If we don’t get it done” in Congress, President Trump has said, \n“we are going to watch Obamacare go down the tubes, and we’ll blame the Democrats . . . [a]nd \nat some point, they are going to come and say, ‘You’ve got to help us.’” “[W]e are getting rid of \nObamacare,” President Trump has boasted, “essentially, we have gotten rid of it,” “[i]t’s dead[,] \n[i]t’s essentially dead,” “there is no Obamacare, it’s dead.” Of course, as a matter of \nconstitutional law, the Affordable Care Act has not been repealed; as a matter of fact, it is not \ndead, and indeed it has proven more resilient than the Administration might have hoped. But the \n2 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 7 of 134\n \nAdministration’s death-by-a-thousand-cuts campaign to undermine the Act via executive action \nalone has taken a toll. \n4.  All Americans are, quite literally, paying the price. The Trump Administration’s \nactions are driving insurers out of ACA exchanges, raising premiums, and increasing the \npopulation of underinsured and uninsured individuals. Defendants’ actions are therefore \nimposing significant costs on families and governments nationwide, including Plaintiffs in this \ncase. Specifically, the Trump Administration’s actions force the cities of Columbus, Ohio, \nBaltimore, Maryland, Cincinnati, Ohio, and Chicago, Illinois, to spend more on uncompensated \ncare for their residents. The Trump Administration’s actions force Steve Vondra and Bonnie \nMorgan to pay more for the quality health insurance coverage they need—insurance that, for \nexample, covers Steve’s preexisting condition. That is the precise opposite of what Congress \nintended the ACA to achieve. Congress passed the ACA to make comprehensive health \ninsurance more affordable and to reduce the costs of uncompensated care. The ACA was \nachieving those aims before the Trump Administration came to power. \n5.  The Trump Administration’s actions are also an affront to the rule of law: to our \nconstitutional system, under which Congress enacts laws and the President faithfully implements \nthem. The Administration’s actions raise questions that go to the heart of our structure of \ngovernment: whether the executive branch must “take care that the laws be faithfully executed,” \nU.S. Const. art. II, § 3, and whether the Constitution therefore prohibits the President and his \nappointees from wielding executive power to destroy a duly-enacted law. The Administration’s \nactions violate the Take Care Clause and the Administrative Procedure Act. They should be \ndeclared unlawful and set aside. \n3 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 8 of 134\n \nNATURE OF THE ACTION \n6.  In 2010, the 111th Congress passed, and President Barack Obama signed into law, \nthe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.1 In so doing, Congress and the President enacted \nthe ACA into law pursuant to the “single, finely wrought and exhaustively considered[] \nprocedure” set forth in the Constitution. INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 951 (1983) (citing U.S. \nConst. art. I, §§ 1, 7). Under the Constitution, the ACA remains law unless Congress and the \nPresident revise or repeal it by that same procedure. Until then, President Trump and his \nAdministration must “take care that the law[] be faithfully executed.” U.S. Const. art. II, § 3. \n7.  Defendants have not only neglected this obligation: they have defied it. Having \ncampaigned on a promise to secure the ACA’s repeal but having failed to convince Congress to \ntake that step, President Trump has turned to executive action alone to try to sabotage the law. \nWhereas the ACA is “designed to expand coverage in the individual health insurance market,” \nKing v. Burwell, 135 S. Ct. 2480, 2485 (2015) (emphasis added), Defendants—by regulation, \nexecutive order, and otherwise—are obstructing individuals’ access to that market, purposefully \nattempting to destabilize it, laboring to increase insurance premiums and decrease enrollment, \nand using resources that Congress has provided to support the law in their blatant attempts to \nundermine it. \n8.  The executive actions challenged here have been undertaken to thwart the ACA’s \ngoals and try to make the law fail. They are therefore “incompatible with the expressed . . . will \nof Congress,” such that the Executive’s “power is at its lowest ebb” and judicial scrutiny is at its \n                                                 \n1   See Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. No. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119 (2010), \nas amended, Health Care Reconciliation Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-152, 124 Stat. 1029 \n(2010). The Affordable Care Act is also known as “Obamacare.” \n \n4 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 9 of 134\n \nmost strict, “for what is at stake is the equilibrium established by our constitutional system.” \nYoungstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 637-38 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring). \nPresident Trump may well believe, as he has repeatedly stated, that “[t]he best thing politically is \nto let [the ACA] explode.”2 But in acting on that intention—by neglecting to faithfully \nimplement the ACA and affirmatively taking numerous executive actions to sabotage it—\nPresident Trump and his Administration have violated the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 \nU.S.C. § 706, and the Take Care Clause, U.S. Const. art. II, § 3. \n9.  At issue here are a final rule and a long list, ever-growing, of other executive \nactions, all undertaken by the Trump Administration to undermine the ACA. \n10.  The final rule is the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Service’s Notice of Benefit \nand Payment Parameters for 2019, 83 Fed. Reg. 16,930 (April 17, 2018), referenced here as the \n“2019 Rule” as it governs many aspects of ACA insurance markets for the 2019 plan year. The \n2019 Rule implements a number of changes, detailed below, that increase the cost of health \ncoverage and impose other barriers to enrollment. These changes lack adequate justification and, \nin some instances, violate the Affordable Care Act’s text; they are therefore “arbitrary, \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A), and must be “[held] unlawful and set aside,” id. § 706(2). \n11.  The 2019 Rule’s unlawful changes are also evidence of Defendants’ failure to \ncomply with their duty under the Constitution to “take care that the [Affordable Care Act] be \nfaithfully executed.” U.S. Const. art. II, § 3. \n                                                 \n2   Amy Goldstein & Juliet Eilperin, Affordable Care Act Remains ‘Law of the Land,’ but Trump \nVows to Explode It, Washington Post, Mar. 24, 2017, \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/affordable-care-act-remains-law-of-\nthe-land-but-trump-vows-to-explode-it/2017/03/24/4b7a2530-10c3-11e7-ab07-\n07d9f521f6b5_story.html. \n5 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 10 of 134\n \n12.  The 2019 Rule does not stand alone. A slew of executive actions, starting with the \nvery first executive order President Trump issued on the day of his inauguration and continuing \nthrough the present, further confirms Defendants’ failure to heed the obligations that the Take \nCare Clause imposes. Unquestionably, “[t]he Constitution does not confer upon [the President] \nany power to enact laws or to suspend or repeal such as the Congress enacts.” United States v. \nMidwest Oil Co., 236 U.S. 459, 505 (1915). Rather, “[u]nder our system of government, \nCongress makes laws and the President, acting at times through agencies . . . ‘faithfully \nexecute[s]’ them.” Util. Air Regulatory Grp. v. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 134 S. Ct. 2427, 2446 (2014) \n(quoting U.S. Const. art. II, § 3) (final alteration in original).3 That principle, embodied in the \nTake Care Clause, is as fundamental as it is longstanding. Just as courts “cannot interpret federal \nstatutes to negate their own stated purposes,” King, 135 S. Ct. at 2493, the President cannot \n“implement” a federal statute in ways designed to destroy it. This is precisely what President \nTrump and his Administration are doing. By actively and avowedly wielding executive authority \nto sabotage the ACA, Defendants are not acting in good faith; instead, they have usurped \nCongress’s lawmaking function, and they are violating the Constitution. \n13.  This Court must intervene. For the reasons set forth below, this Court should \ndeclare that Defendants have violated the Administrative Procedure Act and failed to fulfill their \nconstitutional duty to faithfully execute the Affordable Care Act, enjoin Defendants’ attempts to \n                                                 \n3 See Brief for the Cato Institute, Professor Randy E. Barnett, and Professor Jeremy Rabkin as \nAmici Curiae Supporting Respondents at 10, United States v. Texas, 136 S. Ct. 2271 (2016) (No. \n15-674), https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/texas-v-us-sup-ct-final-2.pdf (“It \nbears emphasis how strong the language of the Take Care Clause is. It is pitched at the highest \nregister of constitutional obligation. The president shall—not may. He shall take care—not \nmerely attempt. He shall take care that the laws be executed—not merely obeyed. And he shall \ntake care that they are executed faithfully. No other constitutional provision mandates that any \nbranch execute a power in a specific manner. Yet the Constitution mandates that the president \nexecute the laws in a specific way: faithfully.”). \n6 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 11 of 134\n \nundermine the ACA, and order them to implement the Act so as to expand, rather than limit, \naccess to quality health insurance. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n14.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331. Plaintiffs’ claim \nchallenging the 2019 Rule is reviewable under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \n§§ 702, 704, 706. As to Plaintiffs’ claim under the Take Care Clause, this Court has authority to \nissue “equitable relief . . . ‘[to] prevent[] entities from acting unconstitutionally.’” Free Enter. \nFund v. Pub. Co. Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 491 n.2 (2010) (quoting Correctional \nServs. Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U.S. 61, 74 (2001)). \n15.  Venue is proper in this judicial district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1)(A) because \nDefendants are agencies and officers of the United States and Defendant the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services is headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland. \nPARTIES \n16.  Plaintiff the City of Columbus, Ohio, is a municipal corporation organized under \nOhio law. See Ohio Const. art. XVIII. Columbus has all the powers of local self-government and \nhome rule under the constitution and laws of the state of Ohio, which are exercised in the manner \nprescribed by the Charter of the City of Columbus.4  \n17.  Columbus, located in Franklin County, is the capital of Ohio. It is the largest city \nin the state and the fourteenth largest city in the United States, with a population of over 860,000, \naccording to 2016 Census estimates. Columbus provides a wide range of services on behalf of its \nresidents, including health services for families and children, public health, public assistance, and \nemergency medical care. \n                                                 \n4   See City Code and Charter, City of Columbus, https://www.columbus.gov/council/Helpful-\nLinks/City-Code-and-Charter; O.R.C. § 715.01. \n7 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 12 of 134\n \n18.  Plaintiff the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore (“Baltimore”) is a municipal \ncorporation, organized pursuant to Articles XI and XI-A of the Maryland Constitution, and \nentrusted with all of the powers of local self-government and home rule afforded by those \narticles. \n19.

The Individual Health Insurance Markets and the Affordable Care Act \n30.  Individual health insurance is insurance that individuals purchase themselves, in \ncontrast to, for example, joining employer-sponsored group health plans. Prior to the enactment \nof the ACA, individual health insurance markets were dysfunctional: \n9 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 14 of 134\n \nOne reason was that premiums for these policies were increasing more than 10% \na year, on average, while the policies themselves had major deficiencies. They \noften excluded pre-existing conditions, charged higher premiums for people with \nhealth risks and for young women, placed limits on annual and lifetime benefits, \nor refused to renew policies for individuals who became sick. Many people who \ntried to buy plans were turned down. In 2010, an estimated 9 million adults who \nhad tried to buy a plan in the individual market over the prior three years reported \nthat they were turned down, charged a higher price, or had a condition excluded \nfrom their plan because of their health. Faced with unsubsidized premiums and \nflawed products, the majority of consumers who tried to buy a plan remained \nuninsured. Only healthy people could get policies, and only those with good \nincomes could afford the premiums.7 \n \n31.  As the Supreme Court has explained, many state efforts to reform the individual \nhealth insurance market in the 1990s were unsuccessful. King, 135 S. Ct. at 2485-86. The ACA \n“grew out of [this] long history of failed health insurance reform,” id. at 2485, and aims to \nachieve systemic improvements in the individual health insurance market by means of certain \nkey reforms, including: \na.  Nondiscrimination on the basis of health status and health history. The \nACA requires “each health insurance issuer that offers health insurance \ncoverage in the individual . . . market in a State [to] accept \nevery . . . individual in the State that applies for such coverage,” 42 U.S.C. \n§ 300gg-1(a), and bars insurers from charging higher premiums on the \nbasis of a person’s health, id. § 300gg. ACA-compliant health insurance \ntherefore covers preexisting conditions; it does not discriminate on the \nbasis of an individual’s health status and health history. See id. § 300gg-4. \n                                                 \n7   David Blumenthal & Sara Collins, Where Both the ACA and AHCA Fall Short, and \nWhat the Health Insurance Market Really Needs, Harvard Business Review, Mar. 21, \n2017, https://hbr.org/2017/03/where-both-the-aca-and-ahca-fall-short-and-what-the-\nhealth-insurance-market-really-needs [hereinafter Blumenthal & Collins]. \n10 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 15 of 134\n \nb.  Essential health benefits. Insurance for individuals and families sold on \nACA exchanges must cover “essential health benefits,” id. § 300gg-6(a), \nincluding hospitalization, prescription drugs, emergency services, \nambulatory patient services, maternity and newborn care, mental health \nand substance use disorder services, preventive and wellness services, and \npediatric services including oral and vision care, see id. § 18022(b)(1). In \naddition, to protect patients from being confronted with devastating costs \nwhen a medical condition exhausts their health coverage, the ACA limits \nso-called “cost-sharing”—for example, deductibles and copayments—for \nessential health benefits coverage, and prohibits plans from imposing \nannual or lifetime limits on such coverage. See id. §§ 300gg-\n6(b), 18022(a)(2), (c). \nc.  Subsidized coverage. The ACA “seeks to make insurance more affordable \nby giving refundable tax credits to individuals with household incomes \nbetween 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty line.” King, \n135 S. Ct. at 2487 (citing 26 U.S.C. § 36B; 42 U.S.C. §§ 18081, 18082). \nFinancial assistance comes through income-related, premium-based tax \ncredits—known as advance premium tax credits, or “APTCs”—for \nqualified individuals. The Act also requires health insurance issuers to \nreduce certain individuals’ cost-sharing expenditures and directs HHS to \nreimburse issuers for such cost-sharing reductions (“CSRs”). See 18 \nU.S.C. § 18071. \n11 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 16 of 134\n \n32.  In addition, as enacted, the ACA required individuals to maintain health insurance \ncoverage or make a shared responsibility payment to the Internal Revenue Service. 26 U.S.C. \n§ 5000A. As a result of congressional action in 2017, the shared responsibility payment will be \nreduced to $0 after December 31, 2018.8 Although it was initially believed that the shared \nresponsibility payment was essential for maintaining the stability of health insurance markets, \nexperience from the ACA’s implementation has indicated that the elimination of the payment \nwill increase premiums for unsubsidized enrollees by 10 percent for 2019 but will not destabilize \nmarkets.9 \n33.  To facilitate individuals’ ability to learn about and enroll in the health insurance \noptions that are available to them, the ACA “requires the creation of an ‘Exchange’ in each State \nwhere people can shop for insurance, usually online.” King, 135 S. Ct. at 2487 (quoting 42 \nU.S.C. § 18031(b)(1)). These exchanges, also known as health insurance marketplaces, enable \npeople not eligible for Medicare or Medicaid to obtain adequate, affordable private insurance \nindependent of their jobs. The exchanges remedy a problem that had long bedeviled individual \nhealth insurance markets: individuals’ inability to intelligently compare different plans in terms \nof price and quality. For ease of comparison, the ACA differentiates plans along four standard \nmetallic tiers—bronze, silver, gold, and platinum, from least to most generous—according to \n                                                 \n8   Budget Fiscal Year, 2018, Pub. L. No. 115-97, § 11081, 131 Stat. 2054, 2092 (2017) \n(codified at 26 U.S.C. §§ 5000A, 5000A note). \n9   Congressional Budget Office, Repealing the Individual Health Insurance Mandate: An \nUpdated Estimate 1 (Nov. 2017), https://www.cbo.gov/system/files?file=115th-congress-2017-\n2018/reports/53300-individualmandate.pdf; Congressional Budget Office, Federal Subsidies for \nHealth Insurance Coverage for People Under Age 65: 2018 to 2028 at 2 (May 2018), \nhttps://www.cbo.gov/system/files?file=2018-06/53826-healthinsurancecoverage.pdf [hereinafter \nMay 2018 CBO Report]. \n \n12 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 17 of 134\n \nhow they apportion costs between individuals and issuers. 42 U.S.C. § 18022(d).10 Thus, as the \nSupreme Court has summarized, an exchange in each state serves as “a marketplace that allows \npeople to compare and purchase” ACA-compliant insurance plans, King, 135 S. Ct. at 2485, \nknown as “qualified health plans” or “QHPs” under the Act, 42 U.S.C. § 18031(b)(1); see id. \n§ 18021(a). \n34.  Individuals may enroll in qualified health plans on an exchange during a specified \nannual open enrollment period or, if they qualify on the basis of certain life events—such as \ngetting married, having a baby, or losing other health coverage—they may enroll during a special \nenrollment period. Id. § 18031(c)(6).11 \n35.  ACA exchanges also help consumers make smart health insurance choices by \nrunning call centers and providing in-person assistance. For example, the ACA requires that \nexchanges award grants to healthcare “Navigators” to “carry out . . . duties” that are specified by \nstatute, id. § 18031(i)(1); see id. § 18031(i)(3), and in HHS implementing regulations, see 45 \nC.F.R. §§ 155.210, 155.215. By law, Navigators’ essential responsibilities include maintaining a \ncurrent understanding of available health insurance options, conducting public education and \nawareness campaigns, helping consumers understand their choices, facilitating consumer health \ninsurance decisions, and ensuring access to consumer protections. \n36.  An exchange may be established by the state in which it operates or, in states that \nelect not to establish exchanges, by the federal government. See King, 135 S. Ct. at 2487 (citing \n                                                 \n10   See Health Plan Categories, HealthCare.gov, https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/health-\nplan-categories/.  \n11   See Open Enrollment Period, HealthCare.gov, https://www.HealthCare.gov/glossary/open-\nenrollment-period/. The exchanges also offer small businesses a way to find qualified health \nplans on a platform called the Small Business Health Options Program or “SHOP.” See 42 \nU.S.C. § 18031(b)(1)(B). \n13 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 18 of 134\n \n42 U.S.C. §§ 18031(b)(1), 18041(c)(1)); 45 C.F.R. § 155.105(f)). In 2018, twelve states operate \ntheir “state-based exchanges” or “SBEs” (operating their own websites rather than using the \nfederally-run HealthCare.gov), twenty-eight states rely entirely on the federal government to run \ntheir “federally-facilitated exchanges” or “FFEs” using HealthCare.gov, and eleven states have \nhybrid exchanges that assume some, but not all, exchange functions.12 As relevant here, the \nexchange in Ohio is an FFE, the exchange in Maryland is an SBE, and the exchange in Illinois is \na hybrid exchange. \n37.  The ACA requires that exchanges offer only quality health insurance: insurance \nthat covers preexisting conditions, for example, and that does not impose annual or lifetime \ndollar limits on core coverage. Such coverage has been found to improve access to care and \noverall health, and to reduce financial burdens for both individuals and institutions that cover the \ncosts of uncompensated care. But increasing enrollment in quality health insurance coverage is \nnot only the ACA’s immediate goal; it is also key to the Act’s long-term success. “Achieving \ninsurance market stability over time . . . requires robust enrollment.”13 Specifically, “[a]t the \noverall market level, enrollment must be high enough to reduce random fluctuations in claims \nfrom year to year.”14 In addition, “[b]ecause the ACA prohibits health plans from denying \ncoverage or charging higher premiums based on preexisting health conditions, having affordable \n                                                 \n12   State Health Insurance Marketplace Types, 2018, Kaiser Family Foundation, \nhttps://www.kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/state-health-insurance-marketplace-types/; see \nHHS, Cooperative Agreement to Support Navigators in Federally-facilitated Exchanges: Notice \nof Funding Opportunity 89 (July 10, 2018), \nhttps://www.grantsolutions.gov/gs/preaward/previewPublicAnnouncement.do?id=62537 (click \n“View PDF”) (listing states that will have an FFE for plan year 2019). \n13   Blumenthal & Collins, supra n.7. \n14   American Academy of Actuaries, An Evaluation of the Individual Health Insurance Market \nand Implications of Potential Changes 5 (Jan. 2017), \nhttps://www.actuary.org/files/publications/Acad_eval_indiv_mkt_011817.pdf. \n \n14 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 19 of 134\n \npremiums depends on enrolling enough healthy individuals over which the costs of the less-\nhealthy individuals can be spread. Enrollment of only individuals with high health care \nneeds . . . can produce unsustainable upward premium spirals.”15  \n38.  Limiting the cost of health insurance is, in turn, essential to promoting increased \nenrollment. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has found that “cost is the top \nreason cited” for individuals ending their coverage.16 To that end, the ACA and its implementing \nregulations aim to drive costs down specifically for coverage available on the exchanges, \nspurring further enrollment and ensuring that health insurance markets function smoothly. \n39.  When faithfully implemented, the ACA’s reforms successfully met Congress’s \ngoal of enabling more individuals—specifically, 20 million more individuals17—to enroll in \nhealth insurance coverage. Indeed, the number of uninsured nonelderly Americans had decreased \nfrom 44 million in 2013 (the year before the ACA’s major coverage provisions went into effect) \nto around 28 million by the end of 2016.18 The uninsured rate had dropped across all \ndemographic groups; individuals with low and moderate incomes, young people, and those who \nlive in rural areas have experienced particularly dramatic coverage gains.19 In addition, the \n                                                 \n15   Id. \n16   Press Release, CMS, High Costs, Lack of Affordability Most Common Factors that Lead \nConsumers to Cancel Health Insurance Coverage (June 12, 2017), \nhttps://www.cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/Press-releases/2017-Press-releases-\nitems/2017-06-12.html. \n17   Namrata Uberio et al., Health Insurance Coverage and the Affordable Care Act, 2010-2016 \nat 8, HHS (March 3, 2016), https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/pdf/187551/ACA2010-2016.pdf. \n18   See Key Facts About the Uninsured Population, Kaiser Family Foundation (Nov. 29, 2017), \nhttps://www.kff.org/uninsured/fact-sheet/key-facts-about-the-uninsured-population/ [hereinafter \nKFF Key Facts]; Robin A.

Several aspects of the ACA contributed to the 57 percent increase in the number \nof people covered in the individual market (on and off exchanges) between 2013 and 2016.21 \nOverall, an estimated 40 percent of the coverage gain attributable to the ACA resulted from the \nexchanges’ policies.22 In addition, the ACA set up the exchanges to encourage competition \namong insurers, both to keep premiums low and to improve customer service. To that end, it \nsignificantly standardized benefits and cost-sharing to facilitate shopping on price, required that \nthe exchanges create tools to allow consumers to compare plans, and established a permanent \nrisk-adjustment program to prevent insurers from profiting by disproportionately enrolling \npeople with lower-than-average health care costs.  \n41.  The results were clear: the unsubsidized cost of coverage in the exchanges, before \nthe start of the Trump Administration, was 10 percent lower than the average employer-\n                                                 \nhttps://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/86761/2001041-who-gained-health-\ninsurance-coverage-under-the-aca-and-where-do-they-live.pdf; Sara R.

The Administration’s Intent to Repeal the ACA, With or Without Congress \n42.  Notwithstanding the ACA’s demonstrated successes, President Trump has \nrepeatedly vowed to ensure that the Act is repealed. For example, on June 15, 2015, in \nannouncing his candidacy for the presidency, he stated, “So, just to sum up, I would do various \nthings very quickly. I would repeal and replace the big lie, Obamacare.”25 On October 8, 2015, \nthen-candidate Trump stated, “We’re gonna repeal Obamacare.”26 Then, on July 21, 2016, in \naccepting the Republican nomination for the presidency, Trump stated, “We will repeal and \nreplace disastrous Obamacare.”27  \n                                                 \n23   Linda J.

Despite these promises by the President—and many, many more not catalogued \nhere—and despite repeated attempts, Congress has declined to pass a bill repealing the \nAffordable Care Act.  \n44.  President Trump has repeatedly admitted that three key elements of his strategy to \nconvince Congress to repeal the ACA are asserting—falsely—that the law is failing, \nundermining the ACA by neglect, and sabotaging the ACA with affirmative executive actions: \na.  On January 11, 2017, President-elect Trump stated, “[T]he easiest thing \nwould be to let [the ACA] implode in ‘17 and believe me, we’d get pretty \nmuch whatever we wanted, but it would take a long time.”28 \nb.  On January 25, 2017, President Trump stated, “[T]he best thing we could \ndo is nothing for two years, let [the ACA] explode. And then we’ll go in \nand we’ll do a new plan and—and the Democrats will vote for it. Believe \nme . . . . So let it all come [due] because that’s what’s happening. It’s all \ncoming [due] in ‘17. We’re gonna have an explosion. And to do it right, \nsit back, let it explode and let the Democrats come begging us to help \nthem because it’s on them.”29 \nc.  On January 26, 2017, President Trump stated, “If we waited two years, \n[the ACA is] going to explode like you’ve never seen an explosion. \n                                                 \n28   Donald Trump’s News Conference: Full Transcript and Video, New York Times (Jan. 11, \n2017), https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/us/politics/trump-press-conference-transcript.html.  \n29   Transcript: ABC News Anchor David Muir Interviews President Trump, ABC News (Jan. 25, \n2017), http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/transcript-abc-news-anchor-david-muir-interviews-\npresident/story?id=45047602.  \n \n18 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 23 of 134\n \nNobody’s going to be able to afford it.

John McCain marking his decisive vote against repeal by a thumbs-down \ngesture.48 Thereafter, President Trump continued to push the false narrative that the ACA was \nfailing.

In that same vein, in a speech on July 23, 2018, according to an observer, \nPresident Trump stated that “Obamacare’s very rapidly fading away” and \nonce again singled out Sen. McCain.64 \no.  Finally—at least as of this filing—on August 1, 2018, President Trump \nreturned to the same theme, stating: \nWe had Obamacare repealed and replaced, and a man—I won’t mention his name.

Statements disparaging the Affordable Care Act have also been made by other \nprominent members of President Trump’s Administration, including when announcing some of \nthe very executive actions at issue here. For example, in announcing that open enrollment for the \n2018 plan year would be cut in half from previous years, CMS’s press release touted, in bullet \nform, “[r]ecent statistics related to the Affordable Care Act” that were deliberately selected to \npaint a false picture of the Act as failing.66 On information and belief, CMS Administrator \nSeema Verma edited these bullets herself. And on a media call to explain the 2019 Rule, Ms. \nVerma said, “It’s clear that Obamacare continues to have negative effects on many \nAmericans.”67 That view—mistaken, and more importantly, contrary to Congress’s judgment—\npermeates and drives the Administration’s campaign to undermine the ACA. \nDEFENDANTS’ EXECUTIVE ACTIONS  \nTO SABOTAGE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT \n47.  President Trump and his Administration have attempted to deliver on their \nrepeated promises to sabotage the Affordable Care Act. The Administration knows what \nexecutive actions would faithfully implement the Act and further the Act’s objective of \nexpanding affordable health insurance to every American.68 Yet the Administration has \nrepeatedly refused to pursue such actions and has instead adopted policies affirmatively designed \nto undermine the Act. As detailed below, multiple provisions of the 2019 Rule, and many other \n                                                 \n66   Press Release, CMS, CMS Issues Final Rule to Increase Choices and Encourage Stability in \nHealth Insurance Market for 2018 (Apr. 13, 2017), \nhttps://www.cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/Press-releases/2017-Press-releases-\nitems/2017-04-13-2.html.  \n67   Allison Inserro, CMS Creates New ACA Penalty Mandate Exemptions, Including Opposition \nto Abortion, AJMC, Apr. 10, 2018, https://www.ajmc.com/newsroom/cms-creates-new-aca-\npenalty-mandate-exemptions-including-opposition-to-abortion.  \n68   See, e.g., Letter from Andrew M.

The 2019 Rule \n48.  In April 2018, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services promulgated a \nfinal rule that undermines many of the Act’s safeguards and requirements. See Notice of Benefit \nand Payment Parameters for 2019, 83 Fed. Reg. 16,930 (April 17, 2018). Specifically, many \nprovisions of the 2019 Rule roll back protections that the Act guarantees, make it more difficult \nto enroll in ACA-compliant plans, and drive up the cost of ACA-compliant plans. For the \nreasons explained below, the enumerated provisions of the 2019 Rule violate the Administrative \nProcedure Act and must be set aside.  \n  Eliminating Protections that the ACA Guarantees \n49.  Numerous provisions of the 2019 Rule weaken or eliminate ACA protections \nnecessary to ensure that individuals have access to quality, affordable health insurance coverage. \n1.  Permitting Exchanges to Strip Individuals of Eligibility for Tax Credits \nWithout Providing Direct Notification \n50.  As noted above, many individuals who purchase health insurance through the \nexchanges are eligible for premium subsidies known as advance premium tax credits. The \nAffordable Care Act required HHS to promulgate regulations further defining APTC eligibility. \n42 U.S.C. §§ 18081, 18082. Among other things, HHS regulations direct exchanges to deny \nAPTCs to an individual if the Internal Revenue Service notifies the exchange that the individual \nor a member of her household did not reconcile the amount of advance premium tax credits she \nreceived with the amount of the actual premium tax credit she should have been allowed on her \nprior year’s tax return. See 45 C.F.R. § 155.305(f)(4) (describing process for filing a federal \nincome tax return). This provision, known as the failure to reconcile provision, was amended in \n29 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 34 of 134\n \n2016 to specify that an exchange may not deny APTC under this provision “unless direct \nnotification is first sent to the tax filer . . . that his or her eligibility will be discontinued as a \nresult of the tax filer’s failure to comply with the requirement.” 45 C.F.R. § 155.305(f)(4)(ii) \n(2016) (effective Jan. 17, 2017 to June 17, 2018). \n51.  The 2019 Rule continues to require that exchanges deny APTCs to individuals \nwho fail to reconcile APTCs received in a prior year on their tax return but, crucially, removes \nthe requirement that exchanges first provide such individuals with direct notification that their \neligibility will be discontinued as a result of their failure to comply with this requirement. 83 \nFed. Reg. at 16,982. The 2019 Rule’s failure to reconcile provision is contrary to law and \narbitrary and capricious, and therefore must be set aside. \n52.  The failure to reconcile provision conflicts with express statutory language \nrequiring that any eligible individual be allowed to claim APTC. Under 26 U.S.C. § 36B, “[i]n \nthe case of an applicable taxpayer, there shall be allowed as a credit against the tax \nimposed . . . for any taxable year an amount equal to the premium assistance credit amount of the \ntaxpayer for the taxable year.” The statute’s plain terms thus require that any applicable taxpayer \nbe allowed to claim an APTC. The term “applicable taxpayer” means, “with respect to any \ntaxable year, a taxpayer whose household income for the taxable year equals or exceeds 100 \npercent but does not exceed 400 percent of an amount equal to the poverty line for a family of \nthe size involved.” 26 U.S.C. § 36B(c)(1)(A). Whether an individual has reconciled her APTC \nhas no bearing on whether she is an “applicable taxpayer” under the statute. Therefore, depriving \nan “applicable taxpayer” of the credit that the statute says “shall be allowed” based on a failure \nto reconcile his or her taxes violates the plain language of the statute. \n30 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 35 of 134\n \n53.  In addition, CMS’s decision to remove the direct notification requirement is \narbitrary and capricious. CMS attempted to justify its decision to remove the direct notification \nrequirement by asserting that state exchanges are not equipped to send direct notices and in light \nof the agency’s belief that “ensuring consumers are not receiving APTC improperly is necessary \nfor program integrity.” 83 Fed. Reg. at 16,984. This purported justification fails, and the 2019 \nRule’s failure to reconcile provision is arbitrary and capricious, for at least two reasons. First, \nCMS offered no evidence that consumers are in fact “receiving APTC improperly.” Id. Second,  \nthe 2019 Rule indicates that FFEs will continue to provide direct notification, demonstrating that \nCMS recognizes the utility and importance of such notifications. See id. at 16,983. Indeed, the \ndirect notice requirement was added to the failure to reconcile provision in 2016 in response to \nconcerns that denying APTCs without direct notice would violate due process.69 CMS thus \nknows about the problem that direct notification was designed to solve, and yet is now \neliminating the solution without setting forth any evidence that the problem has gone away.  \n54.  The 2019 Rule will cause eligible individuals to lose the subsidies that the ACA \nguarantees, and will do so without providing any advance, direct notification. In 2017, annual \npremium tax credits averaged $4,458.70 The unexpected loss of this assistance would likely cause \nmany if not most individuals to drop coverage entirely, especially since they will not know why \nthey lost it or how to remedy their loss. Individuals might lose subsidies for any number of \nreasons that would ultimately prove unfounded; direct notification facilitated individuals’ efforts \nto determine why they had lost eligibility and how to fix the problem. Former Administration \n                                                 \n69   HHS, Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters for 2018; Amendments to Special \nEnrollment Periods, 81 Fed. Reg. 94,058, 94,124 (Dec. 22, 2016). \n70  See CMS, 2017 Effectuated Enrollment Snapshot 5 (June 12, 2017), \nhttps://downloads.cms.gov/files/effectuated-enrollment-snapshot-report-06-12-17.pdf.  \n31 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 36 of 134\n \nofficials who worked to implement the ACA’s advance premium tax credit program estimate that \nthis Administration’s decision could deprive up to 800,000 eligible individuals of their APTCs, \nleading to a significant rise in the number of uninsured Americans—directly contrary to the \npurpose of the Act. \n2.  Outsourcing to States the Compliance Review of Insurance Plans to be \nOffered on Federal Exchanges \n55.  According to the text of the ACA, the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n“shall, by regulation, establish criteria for the certification of health plans as qualified health \nplans,” 42 U.S.C. § 18031(c)(1), including criteria that “ensure a sufficient choice of providers,” \nid. § 18031(c)(1)(B)—i.e., criteria that ensure network adequacy. Pursuant to those criteria, “[a]n \nExchange shall, at a minimum[,] implement procedures for the certification, recertification, and \ndecertification . . . of health plans as qualified health plans.” 42 U.S.C. § 18031(d)(4)(A). \n56.  Consistent with these statutory requirements, CMS, acting as the exchange in \nstates with federally-facilitated exchanges, used to review network adequacy and accreditation \nstatus plans that insurers proposed to offer on those exchanges. \n57.  The 2019 Rule instead extends a policy first adopted in the 2018 Market \nStabilization Rule, 82 Fed. Reg. 18,346, 18,371-72 (April 18, 2017), under which CMS will \n“rely on the [s]tates’ reviews” of network adequacy and other critical requirements in certain \nfederally-facilitated exchanges, see 83 Fed. Reg. at 17,024-26. In defending its decision, CMS \nexplained that it “is committed to recognizing States’ role as the primary regulator of their \ninsurance markets,” and that it sought “to limit duplicative oversight over issuers.” Id. at 17,024. \nCMS’s decision is both contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious under the APA, and must be \nset aside. \n32 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 37 of 134\n \n58.  First, CMS’s decision conflicts with express statutory language, quoted above, \nthat requires the federal government, as the administrator of federally-facilitated exchanges, to \ncertify plans proffered by insurers as qualified health plans under the applicable statutory and \nregulatory criteria. Under the ACA, the Secretary of Health and Human Services “shall, by \nregulation, establish criteria for the certification of health plans as qualified health plans,” \nincluding criteria that “ensure a sufficient choice of providers.” 42 U.S.C. § 18031(c)(1) \n(emphasis added). Pursuant to those criteria, “[a]n Exchange shall, at a minimum[,] implement \nprocedures for the certification, recertification, and decertification . . . of health plans as qualified \nhealth plans.” 42 U.S.C. § 18031(d)(4)(A) (emphasis added). The statute’s repeated use of the \nterm “shall” makes plain that these are mandatory duties. Moreover, the statutory requirement to \ncertify health plans is a “minimum” requirement, 42 U.S.C. § 18031(d)(4)(A), below which an \nexchange cannot fall. Simply deferring to states to conduct plan reviews does not constitute \n“implement[ing] procedures” for the exchange’s review. \n59.  Interpreting the statute to prohibit CMS’s decision to rubber-stamp states’ review \nof network adequacy for federally-facilitated exchanges is also consistent with the Act’s purpose. \nAmong other things, “[t]he Act aims to increase the number of Americans covered by health \ninsurance” adequate to meet their health needs. Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. \n519, 538 (2012). But health insurance cannot meet a consumer’s needs if the provider’s network \nis inadequate—that is, if it lacks facilities close to the consumer’s home or that are equipped to \nhandle the consumer’s specific medical conditions. Thus, permitting CMS, as the administrator \nof federally-facilitated exchanges, to approve a state’s assessment of network adequacy \npowerfully undermines this central feature of, and conflicts with, the ACA. \n33 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 38 of 134\n \n60.  Second, even if the ACA permitted the choice CMS made, the explanation CMS \noffered for outsourcing its duties to states is insufficient, confirming that its choice was arbitrary \nand capricious. CMS offered virtually no response to commenters’ views that “[s]tates’ and \naccrediting entities’ review processes do not do enough to ensure enrollees have adequate access \nto necessary care,” simply asserting that its decision would “reduc[e] regulatory burden on \nissuers, while also preserving adequate access to care.” 83 Fed. Reg. at 17,025. In particular, \nCMS failed to provide evidence to buttress its assertion that state review procedures are \nsufficient to guarantee network adequacy, including, for example, an analysis of the rigor of state \nprocedures or assessments of plans certified by state regulators. That notwithstanding that \n“[a]long with lacking quantitative standards to ensure broad coverage, most states lack an \nadequate process to protect consumers forced to seek out-of-network treatment in particular \ncases.”71 Similarly, CMS neglected to consider how an exchange operator may be uniquely \npositioned to assess plan adequacy. Because CMS did not sufficiently justify its decision, failed \nto adequately respond to comments, and failed to consider important aspects of the problem, its \ndecision in the 2019 Rule to outsource plan review on federally-facilitated exchanges to states \nwas arbitrary and capricious. \n61.  Outsourcing federal plan review to states will permit insurers to market plans with \noverly restrictive networks of providers—networks that could thereby limit patient access to \ncare. Even before the 2019 Rule, only 41 percent of qualified health plans in FFE states had \n                                                 \n71   Mark Hall & Caitlin Brandt, Network Adequacy Under the Trump Administration, Health \nAffairs Blog, Sept. 14, 2017, \nhttps://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20170914.061958/full/. \n \n34 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 39 of 134\n \nnetworks that included National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers.72 Similarly, one \nstudy estimated that 15 percent of FFE plans lacked in-network physicians for at least one \nspecialty.73 These numbers will continue to fall now that the federal government has shirked its \nplan review responsibilities. More consumers will end up purchasing inadequate plans, either \nthrough necessity or confusion—meaning that a greater share of the population will obtain \ninsurance coverage that is insufficient to meet their health care needs. The rate of the \nunderinsured will therefore increase. \n3.  Reducing Oversight of Insurance Brokers Participating in Direct \nEnrollment \n62.  By reducing federal oversight of insurance brokers that assist consumers in \nsigning up for insurance on ACA exchanges via direct enrollment, see id. at 16,981-82, the 2019 \nRule will enable brokers to provide consumers with incorrect information and permit brokers to \ndeny consumers the assistance that they need, and that the ACA requires, so that they can \nidentify and purchase the health insurance that best meets their situation. \n63.  Direct enrollment is a process under which a consumer enrolls in an ACA-\ncompliant health insurance plan through a third-party website instead of through the \ngovernmental platform (HealthCare.gov for FFEs). Direct enrollment entities are “agents, \nbrokers, and issuers that participate in direct enrollment and use their own internet website for \n[qualified health plan] selection or to complete the Exchange eligibility application.” Id. at \n16,981. Given evidence that direct enrollment entities were committing fraud, signing up \n                                                 \n72   Kenneth L. Kehl et al., Access to Accredited Cancer Hospitals Within Federal Exchange \nPlans Under the Affordable Care Act, 35 J. Clinical Oncology 645, 647 (2017). \n73   Stephen C. Dorner et al., Adequacy of Outpatient Specialty Care Access in Marketplace \nPlans Under the Affordable Care Act, JAMA Network (2015), \nhttps://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2466113. \n35 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 40 of 134\n \nindividuals without their knowledge or consent, and using inaccurate calculators for APTC \neligibility, prior rules provided a strong oversight structure and required such entities to be \naudited by third parties that HHS approved. \n64.  The 2019 Rule eliminates this protection and permits agents, brokers, and issuers \nparticipating in direct enrollment to “select their own third-party entities for conducting audits, \nrather than requiring HHS to initially review and approve these entities”—i.e., to select an \nauditor that has not been approved by HHS to determine whether the agent, broker, or issuer is \nready to handle direct enrollment in compliance with relevant requirements. Id. \n65.  CMS’s decision to weaken oversight over direct enrollment entities is arbitrary \nand capricious and must be set aside. First, CMS failed to grapple with evidence, well known to \nthe agency, that direct enrollment entities have in the past produced poor information for \nconsumers, facilitating consumers’ poor enrollment choices. That evidence is what necessitated \nCMS oversight of direct enrollment entities’ auditors in the first place. Second, and relatedly, \nCMS failed to adequately respond to comments expressing “concern[] that enrollment through a \nnon-governmental site would occur without proper oversight and controls.” Id. at 16,982. Indeed, \nCMS offers no meaningful response, and instead asserts, without evidence, that it “believe[s]” \nthat its decision “will ensure that quality operational readiness reviews are conducted.” Id. \n66.  Scaling back oversight of agents, brokers, and issuers that participate in direct \nenrollment will increase the likelihood that consumers receive inaccurate information, thus \ndecreasing overall enrollment and leading to a rise in the rate of the uninsured. CMS’s decision \nto shirk its responsibilities will also lead to a rise in the rate of the underinsured, as confusion \naround APTC eligibility facilitated by CMS’s withdrawal will lead individuals to choose plans \nthat are not appropriate to their needs.  \n36 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 41 of 134\n \n  Deterring Americans from Enrolling in Quality Health Insurance Plans \n67.  Other provisions of the 2019 Rule make it more difficult for consumers to enroll \nin ACA-compliant health insurance coverage. \n1.  Making It Harder to Compare Insurance Plans \n68.  A key function of the exchanges is to “allow[] people to compare and purchase” \nqualified health plans. King, 135 S. Ct. at 2485. In order to carry out this obligation—”to \nsimplify the consumer shopping experience and to allow consumers to more easily compare \nplans across issuers”—prior rules supported “standardized options,” which are qualified health \nplans at different levels of coverage with a cost-sharing structure specified by HHS, including \nfixed deductibles, fixed annual limitations on cost-sharing, and fixed copayments or coinsurance \nfor certain specified benefits.74  \n69.  HHS supported standardized options given its recognition that “[a]n excessive \nnumber of health plan options makes consumers less likely to make any plan selection, more \nlikely to make a selection that does not match their health needs, and more likely to make a \nselection that leaves them less satisfied.”75 HHS further stated that its experience during prior \n“open enrollment periods suggests that many consumers, particularly those with a high number \nof health plan options, find the large variety of cost-sharing structures available on the \nExchanges difficult to navigate.” 80 Fed. Reg. at 75,542. HHS determined that “standardized \noptions will provide these consumers the opportunity to make simpler comparisons of plans \noffered by different issuers within a metal level,” and to “focus their decision making on the \n                                                 \n74   See CMS, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment \nParameters for 2017, 81 Fed. Reg. 12,204, 12,205, 12,289-293 (Mar. 8, 2016) (final rule). \n75   See HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters for 2017, 80 Fed. Reg. 75,488, 75,542 \n(Dec. 2, 2015) (proposed rule); see id. at 75,542 & nn.31-32 (citing data). \n37 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 42 of 134\n \nproviders in the plan networks, premiums, benefits, and quality,” and prevent consumers from \nhaving “to make complex tradeoffs among cost-sharing differences among a large number of \nplans.” Id. “For the 2017 and 2018 benefit years, HHS specified standardized options in \nrulemaking, encouraged issuers to offer such plans, and provided differential display of these \nplans on HealthCare.gov.” 83 Fed. Reg. at 16,974. \n70.  Notwithstanding the agency’s own understanding of their effectiveness, the 2019 \nRule discontinues support for standardized options. See id. at 16,974-75. CMS’s decision to do \nso is arbitrary and capricious. CMS claims that standardized options stymied innovation, \n“removing incentives for issuers to offer coverage with innovative plan designs.” Id. at 16,974. \nYet CMS has cited no data to support that contention. Furthermore, CMS offered no reasonable \nresponse to commenters who pointed out that standardized options “are a useful consumer-\nsupport tool that aids in plan comparisons and selection,” that their presence in fact “encourages \nissuers to innovate on other plan features and encourages issuers to compete on networks and \nformularies,” and that their withdrawal “could create confusion for consumers, especially those \nwith low health literacy or certain health conditions.” Id. at 16,975 (emphasis added). CMS has \nnot adequately explained its decision to make comparison shopping more difficult. \n71.  By eliminating support for standardized options on federal exchanges, the 2019 \nRule makes it more difficult for consumers to select appropriate health coverage, and also \nincreases the risk that they will go without coverage entirely. These effects will, in turn, increase \nthe size of the underinsured and uninsured populations. Indeed, CMS itself cited commenters \nwho pointed out “that removing the standardized option designation could make plan selection \nmore difficult resulting in fewer people enrolling in QHPs.” Id. \n38 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 43 of 134\n \n72.  Moreover, eliminating support for standardized options will limit the degree to \nwhich health plans will compete on price; instead, some plans will choose to compete on benefit \ndesign in a gambit to discourage high-risk enrollees. Research found that after Massachusetts \nstandardized its plans, consumers placed additional weight on cost-sharing features of their plan \nselections.76 Covered California, which runs California’s ACA exchange, attributes some of its \nsuccess in offering affordable choices to its use of standardized plans.77 Without standardized \noptions, it will be harder for individuals to select coverage, prices will rise, and the rate of the \nuninsured and underinsured will increase.  \n2.  Undermining the Navigator Program \n73.  As explained above, the ACA requires exchanges to award grants to healthcare \n“Navigators” that are responsible for helping individuals enroll in qualified health plans. 42 \nU.S.C. § 18031(i). Under HHS’s prior rules, each exchange was required to have two \nNavigators, one of those Navigators was required to be a community- and consumer-focused \nnonprofit, and Navigators were required to have physical presences in the areas they served.78 \nCMS decided to eliminate these requirements in the 2019 Rule. See 83 Fed. Reg. at 16,979-80. \nIts decision violates the APA in multiple ways. \n74.  First, CMS’s decision to eliminate these requirements is contrary to law because it \npermits entities to qualify as Navigators that cannot satisfy the relevant statutory criteria. Among \nother things, Navigators must “conduct public education activities to raise awareness of the \n                                                 \n76   Keith M. Marzilli Ericson, & Amanda Starc, How Product Standardization Affects Choice: \nEvidence from the Massachusetts Health Insurance Exchange, 50 J. Health Econ. 71 (2016). \n77   Shelby Livingston, How California Made Obamacare Work, Modern Healthcare, June 13, \n2017, http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20170613/NEWS/170619961. \n78   See 45 C.F.R. §§ 155.210(c)(2), 155.210(e)(7), 155.215(h) (effective May 9, 2016 to June \n17, 2018).  \n39 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 44 of 134\n \navailability of qualified health plans,” 42 U.S.C. § 18031(i)(3)(A); “distribute fair and impartial \ninformation concerning enrollment in qualified health plans, and the availability of premium tax \ncredits . . . and cost-sharing reductions,” id. § 18031(i)(3)(B); “facilitate enrollment in qualified \nhealth plans,” id. § 18031(i)(3)(C); provide enrollees with grievances, complaints, or questions \nabout their health plans with referrals to specified entities, id. § 18031(i)(3)(D); and “provide \ninformation in a manner that is culturally and linguistically appropriate to the needs of the \npopulation being served by the Exchange or Exchanges,” id. § 18031(i)(3)(E). But Navigators \nwithout a physical presence in an exchange service area cannot, in the terms CMS itself used in \nproposing the physical presence requirement, “provide[]” “face-to-face assistance . . . to \napplicants and enrollees”79—they therefore cannot adequately carry out the statutory duties \nsummarized above.  \n75.  The statute also requires Navigators to “demonstrate to the Exchange involved \nthat [they have] existing relationships, or could readily establish relationships, with employers \nand employees, consumers (including uninsured and underinsured consumers), or self-employed \nindividuals likely to be qualified to enroll in a qualified health plan.” 42 U.S.C. § 18031(i)(2)(A). \nThe prior requirement that exchanges award grants to at least two Navigators, and that one be a \ncommunity- and consumer-focused nonprofit, faithfully implemented this statutory mandate; the \n2019 Rule’s elimination of these requirements violates it. Current Navigators will potentially be \nreplaced by organizations with conflicts of interest because commissions prompt them to steer \nenrollees to particular insurers. New Navigators may also have an incentive to discourage \nenrollment of high-cost enrollees. \n                                                 \n79   CMS, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Exchange and Insurance Market \nStandards for 2015 and Beyond, 79 Fed. Reg. 15,808, 15,832 (Mar. 21, 2014). \n40 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 45 of 134\n \n76.  Second, the 2019 Rule’s elimination of the physical presence requirement is \narbitrary and capricious. As noted above, in proposing the requirement CMS understandably \nrecognized that face-to-face assistance is necessary for Navigators to carry out their statutorily \nrequired duties. 79 Fed. Reg. at 15,832. In response to CMS’s proposal to eliminate the \nrequirement, “many commenters [stated] that entities not physically present in an Exchange \nservice area may not be able to provide a full spectrum of local outreach, education, and \nassistance to support enrollment and post-enrollment activities”; “[m]any commenters” also \nstated “that removing this requirement would negatively affect hard-to-reach populations, as the \nin-person assistance provided by Navigator entities is often the only known resource and form of \nsupport for some low-income and other at-risk populations”; and “some commenters [stated] that \nweb or phone-based assistance is a poor substitute for in-person assistance delivered by a known \nand trusted community-based organization, and that this is particularly true for those living with \nsignificant health needs for whom remote assistance may prove inadequate and frustrating.” 83 \nFed. Reg. at 16,980. On top of that, CMS acknowledged—twice—”that entities with a physical \npresence and strong relationships in their [exchange] service areas tend to deliver the most \neffective outreach and enrollment results.” Id.; see id. at 16,979-80 (similar). Yet HHS \neliminated the requirement. That is arbitrary and capricious. \n77.  The Administration’s actions will decrease individuals’ and families’ in-person \naccess to complete, impartial information. In so doing, they will dampen overall enrollment, \nespecially among vulnerable populations, and thereby increase the rate of the uninsured. People \nwho receive in-person assistance are nearly 40 percent more likely to enroll in coverage than \n41 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 46 of 134\n \npeople who are forced to go it alone.80 In-person assistance is particularly important for young \npeople and minority populations, especially Latinos. A study conducted during the ACA’s first \nopen enrollment period found that two out of every five young people who successfully enrolled \nin coverage received help from a Navigator.81 Another study found that nearly 50 percent of \nLatinos who successfully enrolled received in-person assistance.82 Decreased in-person access to \nNavigators makes it more difficult for individuals to shop for appropriate health insurance, and \nwill lead to a rise in the uninsured and underinsured. \n3.  Making Small Business Exchanges Less User-Friendly \n78.  The ACA requires exchanges to “provide[]for the establishment of a Small \nBusiness Health Options Program”—a “‘SHOP Exchange’[] that is designed to assist” certain \n“small employers in facilitating the enrollment of their employees in qualified health plans \noffered in the small group market.” 42 U.S.C. § 18031(b)(1)(B).83 The ACA further requires \nSHOP exchanges to “make available qualified health plans to . . . qualified employers,” id. \n§ 18031(d)(2)(A); to protect employers’ and employees’ choice among certain qualified health \n                                                 \n80   Sara R. Collins et al., Following the ACA Repeal-and-Replace Effort, Where Does the U.S. \nStand on Insurance Coverage?, Commonwealth Fund (Sept. 7, 2017), \nhttp://www.commonwealthfund.org/Publications/Issue-Briefs/2017/Sep/Post-ACA-Repeal-and-\nReplace-Health-Insurance-Coverage.  \n81   Deloitte, Young Adults and Health Insurance: Not Invincible--but Perhaps Convincible \nFindings from the Deloitte 2014 Survey of Young Adults and Health Insurance 6 (2014), \nhttps://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/life-sciences-health-care/us-chs-\nyoung-adults-and-health-insurance.pdf.  \n82   Adrian Garcia Mosqueira & Benjamin D. Sommers, Better Outreach Critical to ACA \nEnrollment, Particularly for Latinos, To the Point, Jan. 14, 2016, \nhttp://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/blog/2016/jan/better-outreach-critical-to-aca-\nenrollment-particularly-for-latinos.  \n83   See 42 U.S.C. § 18024(b)(2) (defining “small employer”). See generally Small Business \nHealth Options Program (SHOP), CMS, https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Programs-and-\nInitiatives/Health-Insurance-Marketplaces/SHOP.html.  \n42 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 47 of 134\n \nplans, see id. § 18032(a)(2); and to protect employees’ ability to enroll even after their employer \nno longer qualifies as a small employer under the Act, see id. § 18024(b)(4)(D). \n79.  Under prior rules, CMS interpreted the ACA as “requir[ing] that all SHOPs \nprovide for employer eligibility, employee eligibility, and certain enrollment functions, including \npremium aggregation functions.” 83 Fed. Reg. at 16,996. Provisions of the 2019 Rule purport to \nreinterpret the ACA and remove these requirements. See id. at 16,996-17,006. In so doing, these \nprovisions are contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious. First, the removal of these \nrequirements permits SHOPs that cannot fulfill their statutory duties, described above, which \nviolates the ACA’s text. Second, although CMS purported to justify its decision by reference to \ndeclining enrollment in SHOPs, see, e.g., id. at 16,996, making SHOPs even less functional and \nless user friendly will exacerbate the very problem CMS cited. Because CMS’s interpretation \nviolates the statute and has not been well-reasoned, these provisions of the 2019 Rule violate the \nAPA. \n80.  By eliminating the requirement that SHOP exchanges allow employers to \ndetermine employee eligibility, aggregate premiums, and enroll employees online, the 2019 Rule \nmakes it more difficult for small businesses to offer workers and their dependents affordable \ncoverage, and thereby will increase the size of the uninsured population. These changes will also \npush small businesses to use a broker or buy directly from an insurance company, limiting their \nability to make plan comparisons and shop by price for appropriate coverage, potentially raising \ntheir premiums. \n4.  Imposing Unnecessary Income Verification Requirements \n81.  In general, the ACA makes advance premium tax credits available to individuals \npurchasing insurance on an exchange whose income is between 100-400 percent of the federal \n43 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 48 of 134\n \npoverty line (“FPL”). See 26 U.S.C. § 36B; 42 U.S.C. §§ 18081, 18082. Out of purported \nconcern that individuals inflate their income above the FPL to gain APTCs, resulting in the \npayment of APTCs to those not entitled to receive them, provisions of the 2019 Rule impose \nincome verification requirements “where electronic data sources reflect income under 100 \npercent FPL and a consumer attests to income between 100 percent FPL and 400 percent FPL.” \n83 Fed. Reg. at 16,985; see id. at 16,985-87. \n82.  These provisions are arbitrary and capricious. Even though individuals have been \nseeking and receiving APTCs for years, in the 2019 Rule CMS “acknowledge[d] that it does not \nhave firm data on the number of applicants that might be inflating their income to gain APTC.” \nId. at 16,986. Furthermore, CMS admitted that its new rules will disadvantage “households with \nlower income.” Id. CMS has no sufficient answer to the “many commenters” who “expressed \nconcern that low-income consumers have difficulty in providing documentation to resolve their \nannual income data matching issues and that [CMS’s new rules] would exacerbate that problem.” \nId. Moreover, because APTC is reconciled with actual income from tax data for the year in \nquestion, the concern about program integrity is overstated. Overall, it is more than ironic that in \nthe same rule that CMS repeatedly expresses a desire to cut red tape and reduce unnecessary \nregulation, it nonetheless increases bureaucratic hurdles for the most vulnerable Americans. That \ndisparity renders these new requirements irrational. Because the Administration has not \nadequately explained why burdensome income verification measures are needed, the provisions \nof the 2019 Rule that impose them are arbitrary and capricious. \n83.  By making it harder for consumers to obtain insurance tax credits, these \nprovisions of the 2019 Rule will likely mean that more consumers will choose to go without \ncoverage entirely—i.e., that the rate of the uninsured will increase. The deterrent effects of \n44 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 49 of 134\n \npaperwork burdens are well-documented as a general matter.84 Moreover, in this specific \ncontext, paperwork burdens have historically deterred enrollment of people with relatively low \nneed for health care; those with high health care needs will work harder to get coverage.85 For \nexample, a verification pilot study found that only 55 percent of young adults submitted required \ndocuments compared to 73 percent of older applicants.86 As such, extending verification to \nadditional groups will worsen the risk pool and raise premiums, causing coverage to become less \naffordable.  \n84.  This challenge will be even greater among the lower-income enrollees targeted by \nthis policy since they are more likely to have fluctuating income, part-year or part-time \nemployment, and multiple employers, and to have difficulty accessing and supplying necessary \ndocumentation. One analysis estimates that 50 percent of adults with income below 200 percent \nof the poverty level experience income changes that make them move between eligibility for \nMedicaid and the exchanges.87  \n                                                 \n84   See, e.g., Tricia Brooks, Why is NH Proposing to Replace Proven Electronic Citizenship \nVerification with Burdensome Medicaid Paperwork Requirements?, Georgetown University \nHealth Policy Institute, Center for Children and Families (June 28, 2018), \nhttps://ccf.georgetown.edu/2018/06/28/why-is-nh-proposing-to-replace-proven-electronic-\ncitizenship-verification-with-burdensome-medicaid-paperwork-requirements/.  \n85   Stan Dorn, Helping Special Enrollment Periods Work Under the Affordable Care Act 5-6, \nUrban Institute (June 2016), \nhttps://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/81806/2000834-Helping-Special-\nEnrollment-Periods-Work-Under-the-Affordable-Care-Act.pdf.  \n86  Pre-Enrollment Verification for Special Enrollment Periods, CMS, \nhttps://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Fact-Sheets-and-FAQs/Downloads/Pre-Enrollment-\nSEP-fact-sheet-FINAL.PDF.  \n87   Benjamin D.

Lastly, other provisions of the 2019 Rule make health insurance coverage more \nexpensive for consumers. \n1.  Exacerbating Risk Selection \n86.  The 2019 Rule allows states to petition CMS to reduce by half so-called “risk \nadjustment” transfer payments—payments by insurers with healthier enrollees to insurers with \nsicker enrollees. See 83 Fed. Reg. at 16,955-60. In so doing, the Rule provides insurers a \ndramatically increased incentive to sign up healthy individuals and families and deter enrollment \nby individuals and families with preexisting conditions or other high medical costs.  \n87.  Adverse selection is a major concern in health insurance markets.88 One form of \nadverse selection, called risk selection, arises when “health plans manipulate their offerings to \ndeter the sick and attract the healthy.”89 For a variety of reasons, “[t]he premiums that insurers \nare paid may not fully reflect their population mix, say because premiums are set in advance or \nbecause employers do not fully assess the mix of enrollees before bargaining with a plan over the \npremium.”90 “In such circumstances, insurers have incentives to attract healthy insureds and \nrepel sick insureds” by manipulating their plans and outreach.91  \n88.  To provide a partial solution to the problem of risk selection, the ACA requires \neach state to “assess a charge on health plans and health insurance issuers . . . if the actuarial risk \nof the enrollees of such plans or coverage for a year is less” than other issuers. 42 U.S.C. \n§ 18063(a)(1) (emphasis added). By the same token, it requires each state to “provide a \n                                                 \n88   David M. Cutler & Richard J. Zeckhauser, Adverse Selection in Health Insurance, in 1 \nFrontiers in Health Policy Research 1, 1 (Alan M. Garber, ed. 1998). \n89   Id. at 2. \n90   Id. at 10. \n91   Id. at 12. \n46 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 51 of 134\n \npayment” to insurers if the average actuarial risk of their plans is greater than other issuers. Id. \n§ 18063(a)(2). In other words, the ACA’s risk adjustment scheme aims to defray the costs of \nsigning up sicker enrollees, while limiting the financial benefit to pursuing largely healthy \nenrollees, thereby discouraging risk selection. Indeed, as CMS noted in the 2019 Rule, “[r]isk \nadjustment is widely used in health insurance markets, and is recognized as a critical measure in \nmitigating the effects of adverse selection.” 83 Fed. Reg. at 16,955. \n89.  The 2019 Rule, however, allows states to petition CMS to cut these payments in \nhalf. Specifically, the 2019 Rule permits states to ask to reduce risk adjustment transfer payments \nby up to 50 percent by “identifying the State-specific rules or market dynamics that warrant an \nadjustment and demonstrating the actuarial risk differences in plans in the applicable State \nmarket are attributable to factors other than systematic risk selection.” 83 Fed. Reg. at 16,957. In \nCMS’s view, the fact that “States are the primary regulators of their insurance markets,” id. at \n16,956, justified this unwarranted reduction in payments needed to ensure that health insurance \nmarkets remain stable. That change is arbitrary and capricious.  \n90.  Most importantly, CMS did not seriously grapple with the arguments presented by \ncommenters—and corroborated by multiple studies—that substantial reductions in risk \nadjustment transfer payments would encourage risk selection by insurers, undermining the very \npurpose of the risk adjustment program specifically and the ACA generally. Instead, CMS \nsimply parroted its assertion that “unique State rules or other relevant factors could support a \nreduction,” 83 Fed. Reg. at 16,958, elevating state flexibility over the statutory mandate for an \neffective risk adjustment program. In doing so, CMS also failed to respond to multiple comments \npointing out, among other things, that the risk adjustment transfer methodology already accounts \nfor state-specific factors, and that states can obtain additional flexibility simply by operating their \n47 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 52 of 134\n \nown risk adjustment programs, see 45 C.F.R. § 153.330, which no state currently does, 83 Fed. \nReg. at 16,958. \n91.  Moreover, CMS provided insufficient explanation for why it decided to expand \nthe proposed reductions to insurers in individual markets. To the contrary, CMS acknowledged \nthat “adverse selection in the individual market is not mitigated by group enrollment or minimum \nparticipation requirements as is the selection in the small group market,” 83 Fed. Reg. at 16,956; \nthat “those enrolled in the individual or merged markets typically have higher actuarial risk, risk \nselection, and risk segmentation in plan selection than those enrolled in the small group market,” \nid. at 16,958; and that “risk adjustment transfers are particularly required in these markets to \nmitigate issuers’ risk of adverse selection and incentives to avoid risk,” id. Despite these \nmeaningful differences between individual and small group insurance markets, CMS allowed \nstates to request the same 50 percent reduction for individual markets as well (while not \nsoliciting comments on this amount for this market). In other words, CMS entirely failed to \nconsider an important aspect of the problem. \n92.  Finally, if CMS truly wished to provide states with additional flexibility, then it \nwould have similarly allowed states to increase risk adjustment transfers based on “unique State \nrules or other relevant factors” as well. In rejecting that proposal, CMS made arguments flatly \ncontrary to the reasons underlying its proposed reductions: that “State regulators under their own \nState authority could take actions outside of this flexibility,” and “can also elect to establish and \noperate the [ACA] risk adjustment program.” 83 Fed. Reg. at 16,959. Ultimately, CMS failed to \nexplain why it decided to make the risk adjustment system a one-way ratchet. Because CMS’s \ndecision is therefore internally inconsistent and inadequately explained, it is likewise arbitrary \nand capricious. \n48 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 53 of 134\n \n93.  For these reasons, the 2019 Rule arbitrarily—and unlawfully—allows insurers \nwith healthier enrollees to pay less, thereby decreasing the payments that insurers with sicker \nenrollees will receive. Experience with other systems suggests that insurers will respond by \nskimping on the quality of care or altering benefit design to try to lower cost for or avoid sicker \nenrollees altogether.92 It will also cause insurers to raise premiums now on account of the added \nuncertainty of state action in the future, as well as the inadequacy of compensation once a state \ndoes act. This would discourage enrollment of healthy enrollees while disincentivizing \nemployers from enrolling less healthy enrollees—those more likely to need health coverage in \nthe first place—thereby increasing the number of underinsured or uninsured. \n2.  Curtailing Review of Insurance Rate Increases \n94.  The 2019 Rule also decreases the federal government’s role in reviewing \ninsurance rates, giving insurers greater flexibility to increase premiums without any justification. \nUnder the ACA, “[t]he Secretary, in conjunction with States, shall establish a process for the \nannual review . . . of unreasonable increases in premiums for health insurance coverage.” 42 \nU.S.C. § 300gg-94(a)(1). Pursuant to this statutory duty, CMS has promulgated regulations that \nrequire insurers to justify annual rate increases above a given threshold. See 45 C.F.R. \n§§ 154.101 et seq. \n95.  The 2019 Rule, however, changes this scheme—and thereby flouts CMS’s \nstatutory duties—in two respects. First, the 2019 Rule exempts student health plans from rate \nreview beginning July 1, 2018. 83 Fed. Reg. at 16,972. Second, the 2019 Rule raises the \nthreshold for rate review to rate increases of 15 percent rather than the current 10 percent. Id. at \n                                                 \n92   Wynand P.M.M. van de Ven et al., Risk Selection Threatens Quality of Care for Certain \nPatients: Lessons from Europe’s Health Insurance Exchanges, Health Affairs (Oct. 2015), \nhttps://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/abs/10.1377/hlthaff.2014.1456.  \n49 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 54 of 134\n \n16,972-73. Both of these changes limit the federal government’s review of unwarranted rate \nincreases and are unlawful.  \n96.  To start, the 2019 Rule’s carve-out for student health plans is contrary to the text \nof the ACA. As explained above, the ACA requires review of “unreasonable increases in \npremiums for health insurance coverage,” 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-94(a)(1), which are defined as \n“benefits consisting of medical care,” id. § 300gg-91(b)(1)—a term that encompasses student \nhealth plans, which plainly provide medical care benefits like any other health insurance plan. \nCurrently, the only exceptions to rate review are for “excepted benefits” and “grandfathered \nhealth plan” coverage, both of which are mandated by statute, see 42 U.S.C. §§ 300gg-91(c), \n18011, and for large group plan rates, which are negotiated on a group-by-group basis and \ntherefore cannot be effectively reviewed. By its plain terms, therefore, the ACA requires rate \nreview of student health plans. \n97.  Moreover, the 2019 Rule’s student health plan exception is arbitrary and \ncapricious. As CMS admitted, “[s]tudent health insurance coverage is considered by HHS to be a \ntype of individual market coverage and is generally subject to . . . individual market \nrequirements.” 83 Fed. Reg. at 16,972. CMS provided an insufficient explanation for its decision \nto change course and treat student health plans like large group plans rather than individual \nplans. CMS also failed to meaningfully address comments that explained how exempting such \nplans “would result in minimal oversight and decreased affordability.” Id. Instead, CMS argued \nthat states can step in by engaging in rate review themselves. Id. Acknowledging that some states \nlack “an Effective Rate Review Program,” however, CMS claimed that it would continue to \nmonitor rates “based on complaints and as part of targeted market conduct examinations,” id.—\n50 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 55 of 134\n \nignoring the need for automatic, systemic review of increased rates that underlies the rate review \nprogram. \n98.  The 2019 Rule’s increased threshold for rate review is also arbitrary and \ncapricious. CMS raised the threshold “in recognition of significant rate increases,” 83 Fed. Reg. \nat 16,972—but larger rate increases are a reason for more, rather than less, review. CMS also \ngave short shrift to the “many” commenters concerned about increasing rates, arguing that the \nincreased threshold would have implicated only one rate filing later found to be unreasonable. Id. \nat 16,973. In doing so, CMS ignored the fact that one of the core functions of rate review is to \ndeter unreasonable increases from being submitted in the first place. CMS again invoked state \nrate review procedures as a stopgap measure, see id.—meaning that its explanation is again \ndeficient for the reasons stated above. All told, CMS failed to consider important aspects of the \nproblem, rendering its decision arbitrary and capricious. \n99.  Overall, the 2019 Rule’s unlawful changes to rate review will make it easier for \ninsurers to increase rates without adequate justification; the purpose of rate review is for \ninsurance commissioners and the public to examine the proposed reasons for health insurance \npremium increases in the individual and small-group market and adjust them as appropriate to \nimprove affordability for consumers. In 2011, one in five proposed premium increases was \nreduced through rate review, with rates that went into effect approximately one-fifth lower than \nthose initially requested by the insurer.93 In 2015, rate review lowered premiums in the \nindividual and small group markets by $1.5 billion.94 And if prices are permitted to increase \n                                                 \n93   Kaiser Family Foundation, Quantifying the Effects of Health Insurance Rate Review 3 (Oct. \n2012), https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/8376.pdf. \n94   HHS, Rate Review Annual Report 5 (Dec. 2015), \nhttps://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Forms-Reports-and-Other-Resources/Downloads/Rate-\nReview-Annual-Report_508.pdf.  \n51 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 56 of 134\n \nwithout the significant check provided by rate review, individuals will increasingly decide to go \nwithout appropriate coverage or any coverage at all—driving up the rate of uninsured and \nunderinsured individuals. \n3.  Reducing Rebates for Poor Insurer Performance \n100.  Lastly, the 2019 Rule makes it easier for insurers to avoid paying rebates to \nconsumers if they provide subpar coverage. Under the ACA, insurers must pay rebates if the \npercentage of each premium that they spend on paying claims and improving their services—the \n“medical loss ratio” or “MLR”—drops below 85 percent (for large group insurance plans) or 80 \npercent (for small group and individual insurance plans). 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-18(b)(1)(A). “These \nminimum MLR standards are intended to help ensure that individuals covered under private \nhealth insurance plans (enrollees) receive adequate value for their premiums and to create \nincentives for insurers to become more efficient in their operations.”95 \n101.  The 2019 Rule, however, alters the method by which rebates are awarded in two \nways. First, the 2019 Rule allows insurers to claim a flat 0.8 percent of premium credit for \nquality improvement activities (“QIA”)—i.e., “activities that improve health care quality,” 42 \nU.S.C. § 300gg-18(a)(2)—when calculating medical loss ratio, rather than a percent based on the \namount actually spent on such activities, see 83 Fed. Reg. at 17,032-33. In other words, the 2019 \nRule allows insurers to take credit for improving their services whether or not they actually did \nso. Second, the 2019 Rule makes it easier for states to request reduced medical loss ratio \nthresholds in multiple respects: among other things, the Secretary may lower the threshold if \ndoing so would somehow “help stabilize the individual market in that [s]tate,” id. at 17,034; the \n                                                 \n95   GAO-14-580, Private Health Insurance: Early Effects of Medical Loss Ratio Requirements \nand Rebates on Insurers and Enrollees 1, U.S. Government Accountability Office (July 2014), \nhttps://www.gao.gov/assets/670/664719.pdf. \n52 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 57 of 134\n \nstate need not provide information about its MLR standard formula for assessing compliance, id.; \nand the state need not comply with several other data collection requirements, id. at 17,033-34. \nAll of these changes are unlawful.  \n102.  To start, allowing insurers to claim a flat credit for quality improvement activities \nis contrary to the text of the ACA. The ACA requires an issuer to report “the percentage of total \npremium revenue . . . that such coverage expends” for, among other things, “activities that \nimprove health care quality.” 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-18(a)(2). The statute’s language requires \ninsurers to report the amount actually spent on QIA—much like insurers are obligated to report \nhow much they actually spent on reimbursing claims. Id. § 300gg-18(a)(1). The statute does not \npermit CMS to instead throw up its hands and give every insurer the same credit, whether or not \nthe funds are actually expended. To the contrary, that approach undermines the statute’s clear \npurpose: to encourage insurers to improve the quality of their services, lest they be forced to pay \na rebate.96 \n103.  CMS’s decision is also arbitrary and capricious. CMS decided to allow insurers to \nclaim a flat credit because of what it saw as “issuers’ relatively low and consistent reported \nexpenditures on QIA and the significant burden associated with identifying, tracking, and \nreporting these expenditures.” 83 Fed. Reg. at 17,032. But CMS failed to corroborate its \nassertions of substantial burden, or to meaningfully address comments pointing out that  \n“allowing issuers who spend nothing on QIA to take a standardized credit for QIA would \ndisincentivize issuers from making such investments.” Id. Recognizing the validity of those \nconcerns, CMS did modify its proposal to specify that insurers “that elect the standardized QIA \nreporting option must apply it consistently across all of their [s]tates and markets.” Id. at 17,033. \n                                                 \n96   Id. \n53 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 58 of 134\n \nThat is an inadequate bandaid; nothing would stop an insurer from consistently failing to engage \nin quality improvement and simply claiming the newly invented flat-rate credit for all their plans. \nCMS added that insurers have other incentives to improve quality, but Congress explicitly \ncreated the MLR scheme because it believed that additional incentives are necessary. \n104.  CMS’s attempts to make it easier for states to request reduced MLR thresholds \nconstitute another impermissible effort to lift burdens on insurers at the expense of consumers. In \ndoing so, CMS recognized that “the adjustments to the individual market MLR standard should \nnot undermine consumer protections and that the integrity of the adjustment review process \nshould not be compromised.” 83 Fed. Reg. at 17,036. But CMS simply asserted that states should \nbe permitted to “develop strategies involving an adjusted MLR standard” without complying \nwith what it deemed “duplicative, burdensome requirements” or “up-front restrictions on how \nmuch or what direction of an adjustment a State may seek.” Id. CMS therefore failed to weigh \nthe importance of a robust MLR system, and the importance of each individual requirement, \nagainst the purported administrative hurdles those requirements impose. That failure, too, is \narbitrary and capricious. \n105.  These changes will increase the rate of the uninsured and underinsured. Since the \nACA’s medical loss ratio policy began in 2011, enrollees in the individual market have received \nnearly $1.2 billion in rebates.97 Preliminary data for 2017 suggest that rebates will be much \nhigher than the previous year, with the average MLR dropping from 96 to 82 percent in the \n                                                 \n97   CMS, Summary of 2016 Medical Loss Ratio Results, \nhttps://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Data-\nResources/Downloads/Medical_Loss_Ratio_2016_Annual_Report.pdf. \n \n54 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 59 of 134\n \nindividual market.98 By allowing insurers to increasingly avoid paying these rebates, the 2019 \nRule will effectively cause consumers to pay more for worse insurance, leading to an increase in \nthe number of consumers that lack appropriate coverage. \nII.  Additional Executive Actions Demonstrating Defendants’ Violation of Their \nConstitutional Duty to Faithfully Execute the ACA \n106.  As detailed above, the 2019 Rule includes at least nine separate provisions that \nillustrate how Defendants are violating their obligation to faithfully implement the Affordable \nCare Act. In addition, President Trump and his Administration have taken many other actions \nwith the intent and effect of sabotaging the Act generally and its private insurance reforms and \nexchanges in particular. Taken together, all of these actions—those described above and those \ndetailed below—establish Defendants’ pattern and practice of taking executive action to \nundermine the Act, and they demonstrate Defendants’ violation of the Take Care Clause. \n  Directing Agencies to Sabotage the Act \n107.  Hours after he was sworn in, President Trump signed Executive Order No. \n13,765, “Minimizing the Economic Burden of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \nPending Repeal,” 82 Fed. Reg. 8,351 (Jan. 20, 2017). The Order turned what had been candidate \nTrump’s promises to repeal the ACA into President Trump’s official policy. Id. § 1 (“It is the \npolicy of my Administration to seek the prompt repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable \nCare Act . . . .”). “[P]ending such repeal,” the Order directs Administration officials to “take all \nactions consistent with law to minimize the unwarranted economic and regulatory burdens of the \nAct.” Id.; see id. §§ 2-4. Yet President Trump’s estimation of whether or not the Act’s reforms \nare “warranted” does not, and must not, affect his obligation to take care that the Act is faithfully \n                                                 \n98   Cynthia Cox et al., Individual Insurance Market Performance in 2017 at 2, Kaiser Family \nFoundation (May 2018), http://files.kff.org/attachment/Issue-Brief-Individual-Insurance-Market-\nPerformance-in-2017. \n55 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 60 of 134\n \nexecuted, and actions his Administration has characterized as “consistent with law” have flown \nin the face of that constitutional obligation. \n108.  Executive Order No. 13,765 is not merely a statement of policy. Rather, its \nissuance marked the start of the Trump Administration’s usurpation of Congress’s authority in its \nunilateral effort to repeal the ACA. The Order authorizes agencies to “waive, defer, grant \nexemptions from, or delay the implementation of any” ACA provision or requirement that, in the \nAdministration’s estimation, would impose fiscal or regulatory burdens. Id. § 2. As the press \nreported at the time, the Order “essentially allow[ed] the dismantling of the law to begin even \nbefore Congress move[d] to repeal it.”99 Indeed, five days after signing the Executive Order, \nPresident Trump affirmed his agenda to “let [the ACA] explode” so as to be better positioned to \n“go in and . . . do a new plan.” “We’re gonna have an explosion,” he promised,100 and Executive \nOrder No. 13,765 delivered. \n109.  Joshua Peck, who served as Chief Marketing Officer for the federal government’s \nACA exchange (HealthCare.gov) until 2016, estimated that by signaling that the Administration \nmight not enforce the ACA’s individual mandate, Executive Order No. 13,765 resulted in \n130,000 fewer individuals enrolling in health insurance during the open enrollment period for \n2017 plan year insurance that was ongoing at the time.101 And as projected, within a month of its \n                                                 \n99   Julie Hirschfield Davis & Robert Pear, Trump Issues Executive Order Scaling Back Parts of \nObamacare, New York Times, Jan. 20, 2017, \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/20/us/politics/trump-executive-order-obamacare.html. \n100  Transcript: ABC News Anchor David Muir Interviews President Trump, ABC News (Jan. 25, \n2017), http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/transcript-abc-news-anchor-david-muir-interviews-\npresident/story?id=45047602.  \n101  Joshua Peck, Trump Blocked Nearly 500,000 People From Getting Coverage, Medium, Feb. \n2, 2017, https://medium.com/get-america-covered/trumped-blocked-nearly-500-000-people-\nfrom-getting-coverage-70317eedaaa4. \n \n56 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 61 of 134\n \nbeing issued, the Executive Order indeed resulted in reduced enforcement of the individual \nmandate,102 as further detailed below. \n110.  By issuing and implementing Executive Order No. 13,765, President Trump and \nhis Administration have violated their constitutional obligation to take care that the ACA is \nfaithfully executed. Rather, they have purposefully undermined the Act—the aim of which is to \nexpand access to quality coverage—in at least two ways. First, the Order has limited and will \nlikely continue to reduce progress in decreasing the number of uninsured Americans, directly \nundermining the Act’s aim. And second, by shrinking the risk pool, the Order will make health \ninsurance less affordable, a result counter to the Affordable Care Act’s central goal—a goal so \ncritical that it is featured in the Act’s title. \n  Attempting to Destabilize the Exchanges \n111.  As described above, Congress constructed the ACA to both support, and be \nsupported by, robust enrollment in ACA-compliant plans on ACA exchanges. Key to strong \nenrollment numbers are competitive exchanges with low premiums that attract a broad range of \nconsumers, not just those with high medical expenses, and a broad range of insurers, to foster \ncompetition. If one were setting out to weaken the exchanges, therefore, one could hardly do \nbetter than to sow uncertainty about the rules that govern them and the government support for \nthem. Insurance companies strive to minimize risk and uncertainty. When risk and uncertainty \nincrease, issuers raise premiums to compensate, or even exit insurance markets entirely. Sowing \nuncertainty in insurance markets is precisely what the Trump Administration has done from day \n                                                 \n102  Michael Hiltzik, Trump’s IRS Stages a Stealth Attack on Obamacare, Los Angeles Times, \nFeb. 15, 2017, http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-irs-obamacare-20170215-\nstory.html. \n57 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 62 of 134\n \none, including by issuing Executive Order No. 13,765, described above, and by taking the \ndiscrete executive actions detailed below. \n112.  Exemplifying the Trump Administration’s strategy is the way in which the \nAdministration, over the course of the summer and the fall in 2017, repeatedly threatened to \ndiscontinue reimbursing insurers for cost-sharing reductions—to stop paying insurers back for \nthe reductions in copayments, coinsurance, and so on, that the Act requires them to provide to \nconsumers.103 At the time, pending litigation raised questions concerning those payments, but the \nmerits of those questions are not what is at issue here; rather, the Administration’s actions, aimed \ntoward provoking a legislative repeal, were deliberately designed to introduce uncertainty into \nthe exchanges through threats that the CSR payments would cease. As the President himself \nasserted, in one of his many intentionally intimidating statements, “If you don’t make them, [the \nACA exchange] fails.”104 \n113.  The threats served their purpose. Throughout the country, some insurers that had \npreviously sold health insurance through the exchanges for the 2017 plan year exited them \nentirely, refusing to offer coverage for the 2018 plan year because of the Administration’s refusal \n                                                 \n103  See, e.g., Chad Terhune & Julie Appleby, Uncertainty Over Obamacare Leaves Next Year’s \nRates in Limbo, NPR, July 19, 2017, https://www.npr.org/sections/health-\nshots/2017/07/19/538099050/uncertainty-over-obamacare-leaves-next-years-rates-in-limbo; \nRobert Pear & Thomas Kaplan, Trump Threat to Obamacare Would Send Premiums and Deficits \nHigher, New York Times, Aug. 15, 2017, https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/us/politics/cbo-\nobamacare-cost-sharing-reduction-trump.html.  \n104  Aaron Blake, President Trump’s Thoroughly Confusing Fox Business Interview, Annotated, \nWashington Post, Apr. 12, 2017, https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-\nfix/wp/2017/04/12/president-trumps-throughly-confusing-fox-business-interview-\nannotated/?utm_term=.0b4ab6f8b1a6. \n \n58 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 63 of 134\n \nto guarantee that CSR payments would continue.105 That left some counties with decreased \ncompetition among issuers, which (again) drives up prices and decreases overall enrollment. \nIndeed, at the time, the Congressional Budget Office warned that terminating CSR payments \ncould increase the percentage of people living in areas not served by a single insurer between \n2018 and 2020.106 Other insurers raised premiums by as much as 23 percent for 2018 to guard \nagainst the risk that they would not receive the payments. And (again)—as the Administration \nknew—rising premiums and decreased enrollment threaten the long-term success of the ACA by \nincreasing adverse selection and weakening the market, leading to yet lower enrollment and \nhigher premiums. \n114.  Tellingly, the Trump Administration ultimately stopped making CSR payments \non October 12, 2017, shortly after the reconciliation instruction for legislation to repeal and \nreplace the ACA expired.107 Confirming his aim all along, days later President Trump declared \nthat the Act was “dead” and “gone,” and that “[t]here is no such thing as Obamacare \nanymore.”108 Some insurers and insurance commissioners adjusted to the Administration’s action \nby raising premiums rather than pulling out of the exchanges entirely. The Congressional Budget \nOffice estimated that 2018 silver plan premiums were 10 percent higher because of the \n                                                 \n105  Rachel Roubein, No Certainty on Cost-sharing Payments to Insurers, The Hill, June 8, 2017, \nhttp://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/336974-no-certainty-on-cost-sharing-payments-to-insurers \n(citing the exit of Anthem in Ohio in particular). \n106  Congressional Budget Office, The Effects of Terminating Payments for Cost-Sharing \nReductions (Aug. 15, 2017), https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53009.  \n107  Dan Mangan, Obamacare Bombshell: Trump Kills Key Payments to Health Insurers, CNBC, \nOct. 12, 2017, https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/12/obamacare-bombshell-trump-kills-key-\npayments-to-health-insurers.html.   \n108  Rebecca Savransky, Trump: There Is No Such Thing as ObamaCare Anymore, The Hill, Oct. \n16, 2017, http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/355658-trump-there-is-no-such-thing-as-\nobamacare-anymore. \n \n59 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 64 of 134\n \nAdministration’s actions, and will be 20 percent higher by 2021.109 While few enrollees actually \npaid this sticker price in light of the ACA’s premium tax credits, this likely contributed to a \nreduction in enrollment among people not eligible for premium tax credits.110 And the cost to the \nfederal government of those premium tax credits—and, therefore, to federal taxpayers—\nballooned. \n115.  The Administration’s approach to CSR payments—create uncertainty at every \nturn—weakened insurance markets, particularly given the Administration’s timing. One recent \nstudy explains: \nSeveral subjects amplified that the Trump [A]dministration’s decision to cancel \ncost-sharing reduction payments for the final quarter of 2017, well after it was too \nlate for insurers to adjust their 2017 rates, and just a few days before their \ndeadline to decide on 2018 participation, “had a concussive quality” and was the \n“straw that broke the camel’s back” because it “sent a clear signal” to insurers that \nthey “cannot rely on the federal government to keep its [funding] commitments” \nin the future . . . .111 \nThese views emphasize that “[a]lthough actuarial uncertainty is always present, what has \nespecially bedeviled ACA insurers is the political uncertainty over adverse change in \nrules.”112 Over time, as further detailed below, Defendants have recognized and \ndeliberately exploited their ability to generate such uncertainty, and experts have found—\nas the Trump Administration has known—that many of the actions discussed below will \n                                                 \n109  May 2018 CBO Report, supra n.9, at 7, 9. \n110  Jeanne Lambrew, No “ObamaCare Implosion” from Trump Payment Freeze, The Century \nFoundation, Apr. 19, 2018, https://tcf.org/content/commentary/no-obamacare-implosion-trump-\npayment-freeze/. \n111  Mark Hall, Stabilizing and Strengthening the Individual Health Insurance Market: A View \nfrom Ten States 20, USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy (July 2018), \nhttps://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Stabilizing-and-Strenghtening-the-\nIndividual-Health-Insurance-Market2.pdf (alteration in original). \n112  Id. at 19. \n \n60 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 65 of 134\n \nlead to increased premiums on ACA exchanges.113 If these actions are allowed to stand, \nthey will contribute to the Administration’s stated goal of undermining the Act. \n1.  Promoting Bare-Bones Plans to Try to Weaken ACA Exchanges \n116.  On October 12, 2017, President Trump signed Executive Order No. 13,813, \nentitled “Promoting Healthcare Choice and Competition Across the United States,” 82 Fed. Reg. \n48,385 (Oct. 12, 2017). Alleging that the ACA “has severely limited the choice of healthcare \noptions available to many Americans and has produced large premium increases in many State \nindividual markets for health insurance,” id. § 1(a), the Order directs the Administration to \n“prioritize three areas for improvement in the near term: association health plans (AHPs), short-\nterm, limited-duration insurance (STLDI), and health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs),” id. \n§ 1(b). All three—AHPs, STLDI, and HRAs—provide coverage, often bare-bones coverage, that \ndoes not need to comply with the ACA’s requirements.114 For example, short-term, limited-\nduration insurance can refuse to offer coverage at all, or exclude coverage, for preexisting \nconditions; charge a higher rate based on an individual’s health history and health status; exclude \nbenefits such as prescription drugs, maternity care, mental health services, and substance use \n                                                 \n113  See American Academy of Actuaries, Drivers of 2019 Health Insurance Premium Changes \n2, 4, http://www.actuary.org/files/publications/Premium_Drivers_2019_061318.pdf (addressing \nthe effect of the elimination of cost-sharing reduction payments, and of expanded access to \nSTLDI and AHPs, on premiums). \n114  Association health plans purport to group small businesses, including self-employed workers, \ntogether to obtain coverage as though they were a single large employer. Short-term, limited-\nduration insurance, in keeping with its name, has historically been used to provide stop-gap \ncoverage, for example when an individual transitions from one type of major medical coverage \nto another. Health reimbursement arrangements, also known as health reimbursement accounts, \nare funds set aside by employers to reimburse employees for qualified medical expenses. See \ngenerally Bernadette Fernandez et al., Background Information on Health Coverage Options \nAddressed in Executive Order 13813 at i-ii, Congressional Research Service, \nhttps://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R45216.pdf.  \n \n61 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 66 of 134\n \ndisorder services; can include a dollar cap on services and stop paying medical bills after that cap \nis reached; and are not required to limit consumer out-of-pocket costs. \n117.  By directing his Administration to expand access to bare-bones plans like AHPs, \nSTLDI, and HRAs, Executive Order No. 13,813 will “open doors for young and healthy people \nto flee [the] ACA-compliant market,” i.e., the exchanges, “and find lower premiums” off of the \nexchanges.115 Because on-exchange purchasers will as a group be older and sicker than they have \nbeen in prior years, premiums for on-exchange purchasers will increase. This will lead to \ndecreased enrollments in ACA-compliant plans, particularly among the young and healthy. The \nOrder will thereby increase costs and decrease coverage, phenomena that the ACA was designed \nto prevent. \n118.  Specifically, the Urban Institute estimated that expanded access to short-term, \nlimited duration policies would cause 2.6 million people to lose coverage in 2019.116 The Office \nof the Actuary at CMS projected that such enhanced access would increase premiums for ACA-\n                                                 \n115  Timothy Jost, Trump Executive Order Expands Opportunities For Healthier People To Exit \nACA, Health Affairs Blog, Oct. 12, 2017, \nhttp://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20171022.762005/full/; see Mark A.

Given this, it is no surprise that one analysis found that more than 98 percent of \nhealthcare groups that commented on the Administration’s proposed STLDI regulation expressed \nserious concerns or opposed it outright; the figure was 95 percent for the AHP regulation. \n“Among the groups were virtually every leading patient advocate in the country, including the \nAmerican Lung Assn., the American Heart Assn., the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the March of \nDimes, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, Susan G. Komen, AARP and the advocacy arm \nof the American Cancer Society.

In signing Executive Order No. 13,813, President Trump confirmed its intent, \nsaying, “I just keep hearing repeal-replace, repeal replace. Well, we’re starting that process.”121 \nAnd thus, by using Executive Order No. 13,813 to begin unilateral executive efforts to repeal the \nACA, the Administration directly usurped Congress’s lawmaking function. At least one member \nof Congress, Sen. Rand Paul, claimed to have worked directly with President Trump to craft the \nOrder, in order to achieve the reforms that Congress itself had failed to advance.122 And a \ncomparison of the Order with Sen. Paul’s proposed Obamacare Replacement Act, S. Bill No. \n222, 115th Congress (2017-18),123 reveals multiple similarities. \n121.  In keeping with Executive Order No. 13,813’s directive, as of the date of this \nfiling the Administration has finalized rules expanding access to association health plans124 and \nshort-term limited duration insurance.125  \n122.

First, the Order will result in fewer individuals receiving ACA-\ncompliant health insurance coverage, directly undermining the Act’s goal. And second, by \ndecreasing enrollments in ACA-compliant plans, the Order will increase premiums for quality \nplans, ultimately resulting in even fewer individuals being able to access affordable health care \ncoverage. \n2.  Undermining the Individual Mandate \n123.  As noted above, when Congress enacted the ACA it imposed an individual \nmandate that now, in light of congressional amendments in 2017, requires those without \ninsurance to make a shared responsibility payment through December 31, 2018. See 26 U.S.C. \n§§ 5000A, 5000A note. On February 14, 2017, citing President Trump’s Executive Order No. \n13,765, the Internal Revenue Service announced that it was scrapping a new policy that had been \ndesigned to strengthen the individual mandate by automatically rejecting tax returns of those \nwho fail to answer whether they had health insurance.126 The press reported that this change \nsignaled that the Administration was “loosening up on enforcement of . . . [the] individual \nmandate.”127 Indeed, the IRS confirmed that at the direction of Executive Order No. 13,765, its \ndecision aimed “to reduce potential burden”—i.e., to lessen enforcement—of the ACA.128  \n124.  Although the IRS subsequently reversed course, it waited until October 2017 to \ndo so.129 This was after insurers indicated, in summer 2017, that they would either raise \n                                                 \n126  See Peter Sullivan, IRS Loosening Enforcement of ObamaCare Mandate, The Hill, Feb. 15, \n2017, http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/319672-irs-takes-step-against-obamacare-mandate. \n127  Id. \n128  Id. \n129  Michael Cohn, IRS Won’t Accept Tax Returns Next Year Without Health Coverage, \nAccounting Today, Oct. 17, 2017, https://www.accountingtoday.com/news/irs-wont-accept-tax-\nreturns-next-year-without-health-coverage.  \n \n65 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 70 of 134\n \npremiums or withdraw from the market if they did not have clarity on enforcement prior to the \nSeptember 5, 2017 rate filing deadline.130  The months-long threat of underenforcement of the \nindividual mandate created uncertainty, thereby weakening markets and causing insurers to \nincrease prices. \n125.  On November 1, 2017, the first day of open enrollment, President Trump \nsuggested that Congress repeal the individual mandate as part of a tax reform package.131 He did \nnot, like his predecessor, encourage people to review their health insurance options and sign up \nfor coverage.132 Then, on November 6, 2017, the press reported that in the face of Congress’s \nunwillingness to pass a bill repealing the individual mandate, President Trump was readying an \nexecutive order to attempt the same, by unilateral executive action.133 \n126.  Even after the 2017 tax bill reduced the shared responsibility payment to $0 for \nthe months starting after December 31, 2018, the Administration has endeavored to further \nweaken the individual mandate while the payment remains in effect. For example, when it issued \nthe 2019 Rule, CMS also issued guidance providing expanded access to so-called “hardship \nexemptions” from the mandate.134 \n                                                 \n130  Rabah Kamal et al., An Early Look at 2018 Premium Changes and Insurer Participation on \nACA Exchanges, Kaiser Family Foundation (Aug. 10, 2017), https://www.kff.org/health-\nreform/issue-brief/an-early-look-at-2018-premium-changes-and-insurer-participation-on-aca-\nexchanges/. \n131  @realDonaldTrump, Twitter (Nov. 1, 2017, 7:59 AM), \nhttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/925739132579729420.  \n132  Sarah Kliff, Trump Won’t Advertise Obamacare, So Obama is Stepping In, Vox, Nov. 1, \n2017, https://www.vox.com/health-care/2017/11/1/16592274/obama-obamacare-video.  \n133  Kimberly Leonard, Trump Readies Executive Order to Unravel Obamacare’s Individual \nMandate, Washington Examiner, Nov. 6, 2017, http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/trump-\nreadies-executive-order-to-unravel-obamacares-individual-mandate/article/2639728. \n134  CMS, Guidance on Hardship Exemptions from the Individual Shared Responsibility \nProvision for Persons Experiencing Limited Issuer Options or Other Circumstances (Apr. 9, \n2018), https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Regulations-and-Guidance/Downloads/2018-\n \n66 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 71 of 134\n \n127.  There is no question that the ACA’s individual mandate has had an effect on \nindividuals’ decisions to purchase insurance. For instance, the uninsured rate among high-\nincome young adults, who faced increases in premiums due to the ACA insurance reforms, \nsharply decreased between 2013 and later years, suggesting that the mandate affected their \ninsurance decisions.135 Moreover, multiple studies show that uninsured people who signed up \ndue to the mandate have health costs significantly below other enrollees.136 \n128.  Congress acted to reduce the shared responsibility payment associated with the \nmandate to $0 knowing that it would increase premiums by 10 percent in 2019. But prior to that, \nthe Trump Administration’s threats not to enforce the mandate drove up 2018 premiums all by \nthemselves. Preliminary analyses estimate that the deliberate uncertainty around the mandate’s \nenforcement that the Administration introduced accounted for up to a 20 percent increase in 2018 \nindividual market premiums.137 The Congressional Budget Office also attributed higher \npremiums for 2018 and insurer withdrawals from the exchanges to uncertainty about the \n                                                 \nHardship-Exemption-Guidance.pdf; see also Dan Diamond, Seema Verma Previews Medicare \nAgenda, Politico, Mar. 23, 2018, https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-\npulse/2018/03/23/seema-verma-previews-medicare-agenda-148797 (reporting that Defendant \nVerma was “weighing more exemptions to the ACA individual mandate”). \n135  Matthew Fiedler, How Did the ACA’s Individual Mandate Affect Insurance Coverage?, \nUSC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy (May 2018), \nhttps://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/coverageeffectsofmandate2018.pdf  \n136  See, e.g., Martin B.

By threatening underenforcement of the individual mandate, Defendants have \nviolated their constitutional obligation to take care that the ACA is faithfully executed. Rather, \nthey have purposefully undermined the Act—the aim of which is to expand access to quality \ncoverage—in at least two ways. First, threatening underenforcement of the individual mandate \nwill result in fewer individuals receiving ACA-compliant health insurance coverage overall, \ndirectly undermining the Act’s goal. And second, by decreasing health insurance enrollments, \nthreatening underenforcement of the individual mandate will weaken health insurance markets \nand increase premiums, ultimately resulting in even fewer individuals being able to access \naffordable health care coverage. \n3.  Refusing to Grant State Waiver Requests that Would Further the ACA’s \nGoals \n130.  The ACA permits states to apply for waivers of some of the law’s requirements in \norder to promote innovative policies that—and this is key—”provide coverage that is at least as \ncomprehensive as” ACA-compliant coverage. 42 U.S.C. § 18052(b)(1)(A). \n131.  Although the Trump Administration has encouraged states to apply for waivers,139 \nit has either denied or not responded to many of the requests for waivers that it has received,140 \n                                                 \n138  May 2018 CBO Report, supra n.9, at 2-3. \n139  See, e.g., Letter from Thomas E.

(By contrast, the Administration has eagerly processed state \nwaivers that are designed to reduce access to quality health insurance.141) Indeed, the \nAdministration has dragged its feet even though some states’ waiver requests are designed to \nlower premiums and stabilize insurance markets. For example, the press reported that, upon \nlearning about Iowa’s waiver request and claims that the state’s plan would improve its \nexchange, President Trump personally called Defendant Seema Verma, whose agency—CMS—\nis responsible for processing waiver requests, and instructed her to deny Iowa’s application.142 \n132.  The Administration’s actions have frustrated states’ efforts to support the ACA \nand its reforms and to expand access to affordable, quality health insurance. For example, in \nwithdrawing its waiver request owing to the Administration’s delay, Oklahoma Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services Terry Cline stated that CMS’s failure to approve the waiver would \n“prevent thousands of Oklahomans from realizing the benefits of significantly lower insurance \npremiums in 2018.”143 \n                                                 \nhttps://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Programs-and-Initiatives/State-Innovation-\nWaivers/Section_1332_State_Innovation_Waivers-.html (listing pending, approved, and denied \nwaiver requests).  \n141  See Bruce Jaspen, Trump’s Medicaid Work Rules Hit States With Costs And Bureaucracy, \nForbes, July 22, 2018, https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2018/07/22/trumps-medicaid-\nwork-rules-hit-states-with-costs-and-bureaucracy/#745af26066f5; see also Stewart v.

Attempting to Weaken Public Confidence in ACA Exchanges \n134.  Statements by President Trump and others in his Administration confirm that the \ndriving force behind all of the Administration’s actions described here is to sabotage the \nAffordable Care Act. As exemplified by the statements catalogued above, see supra ¶¶ 42-46, \nthe Trump Administration has been relentless in its efforts to paint a false picture of the Act as \nfailing—or even, in President Trump’s words at a meeting of his Cabinet, as already “dead. It’s \ngone. It’s no longer—you shouldn’t even mention [it]. It’s gone. There is no such thing as \nObamacare anymore.”144 The number of times that President Trump and others in his \nAdministration have called “Obamacare . . . a disaster” can barely be counted.145 The President \n                                                 \n144  Remarks by President Trump in Cabinet Meeting, The White House (Oct. 16, 2017), \navailable at https://web.archive.org/web/20171016180503/https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-\npress-office/2017/10/16/remarks-president-trump-cabinet-meeting. \n145  See, e.g., Jacqueline Thomsen, Trump Vows to Repeal and Replace ObamaCare ‘Disaster’, \nThe Hill, Nov. 23, 2017, http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/361693-trump-vows-to-\nrepeal-and-replace-obamacare-disaster; Jay Willis, President Trump Couldn’t Repeal the \nAffordable Care Act, So He’s Trying to Sabotage It Instead, GQ, Sept. 1, 2017, \nhttps://www.gq.com/story/trump-sabotage-obamacare-marketing (collecting examples). \n \n70 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 75 of 134\n \nhas even gone so far as to assert that “ObamaCare is torturing the American People.”146 Vice \nPresident Mike Pence has called Obamacare a “nightmare.”147 \n135.  It would be one thing if the Administration’s only goal were to build public \nopposition to the Act, but that is not the case. Rather, the Administration’s communications \nstrategy is aimed at creating a false public impression about the ACA and reducing public \nconfidence in the law and its exchanges, thereby discouraging individuals from enrolling in \nACA-compliant insurance and weakening the exchanges. In March 2017, for example, HHS \nlaunched an official website alleging “skyrocketing premiums and narrowing choices” in ACA \nexchanges and asserting that the ACA “has done damage to” the market for individual insurance \nand “created great burdens for many Americans.”148 An official WhiteHouse.gov page likewise \nproclaims that “Obamacare is hurting American families, farmers, and small businesses with \nskyrocketing health insurance costs.”149 And HHS press officials have labored to paint a picture \nof the ACA as “continu[ing] to collapse” and as having “been in a death spiral for years.”150 \n                                                 \n146  @realDonaldTrump, Twitter (July 25, 2017, 6:38 AM), \nhttps://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/889796918615920640.  \n147  Juliet Eilperin et al., White House’s Decision to Atop ACA Cost-sharing Subsidies Triggers \nStrong Opposition, Washington Post, Oct. 13, 2017, \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/white-house-tells-court-it-is-immediately-stopping-\naca-cost-sharing-subsidies/2017/10/13/4c404234-b01d-11e7-be94-\nfabb0f1e9ffb_story.html?noredirect=on&undefined=&utm_term=.2cc7c1747873&wpisrc=nl_m\nost&wpmm=1.  \n148  Providing Relief Right Now for Patients, HHS, https://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/empowering-\npatients/providing-relief-right-now-for-patients/index.html.  \n149  Healthcare, The White House, https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/healthcare/.  \n150  Dan Mangan, Trump’s Health Chief Pushes ‘Waivers’ for States from Obamacare Rules, as \nHHS Says Program in ‘Death Spiral’, CNBC, May 16, 2017, \nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/16/trumps-health-chief-pushes-waivers-for-states-from-\nobamacare-rules.html.  \n \n71 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 76 of 134\n \n136.  Less visibly, recent reports from the Sunlight Foundation have documented how \nHHS has systematically removed information about the ACA from its websites.151 Worse, \nSenators Schatz, Booker, and Murphy, “concerned that the use of appropriated funds to promote \nlegislation pending before Congress” to repeal the ACA “violate both HHS’s constitutional \nresponsibility to implement existing law, and legal prohibitions against using taxpayer dollars to \nlobby in favor of pending legislation,” have collected numerous examples where HHS social \nmedia accounts published “anti-ACA propaganda.”152 For example, then-Secretary of HHS Tom \nPrice tweeted videos that his agency produced to discredit the Act, see infra ¶ 156, with an \nexplicit admonition discouraging enrollment, commenting that “[u]nder Obamacare, coverage ≠ \ncare.”153 Sec. Price also adorned social media posts featuring anti-ACA infographics with official \ngovernment logos.154 Such activities constitute impermissible uses of government funds; they \n                                                 \n151  See Rachael Bergman, Affordable Care Act Page Quietly Removed from Medicare Website, \nSunlight Foundation, May 17, 2018, https://sunlightfoundation.com/2018/05/17/affordable-care-\nact-page-quietly-removed-from-medicare-site/; Rachel Bergman, Removal of the Affordable \nCare Act Website from within Medicaid.gov, Sunlight Foundation (July 2018), \nhttp://sunlightfoundation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AAR-7-CMS-Medicaid-ACA-\n180710.pdf; see also Dan Diamond, Trump Policy Shop Filters Facts to Fit His Message, \nPolitico, July 28, 2018, https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/28/trump-facts-policy-shop-\nadministration-research-714353.  \n152  Letter from Sen.

By working to weaken public confidence in the ACA and its exchanges, \nDefendants have violated their constitutional obligation to take care that the ACA is faithfully \nexecuted. Rather, they have purposefully undermined the Act—the aim of which is to expand \naccess to quality coverage—in at least two ways. First, declining public confidence in the ACA’s \ninsurance markets will result in fewer individuals receiving ACA-compliant health insurance \ncoverage overall, directly undermining the Act’s goal. And second, declining public confidence \nwill weaken health insurance markets and increase premiums, ultimately resulting in even fewer \nindividuals being able to access affordable health care coverage. \n  Working to Decrease Enrollment \n138.  Under the ACA, exchanges must “facilitate[] the purchase of qualified health \nplans.” 42 U.S.C. § 18031(b)(1)(a). Defendants, however, have shirked this duty in multiple \nways, as detailed below, including by slashing funding for advertising and outreach and cutting \nin half the length of time during which federally-facilitated exchanges are open for enrollment. \n139.  As further discussed below, the Administration’s efforts to discourage enrollment \nare having effects. One study has found that two of the decisions at issue here—shortening open \nenrollment and reducing outreach—may result in as much as a 9 percent increase in \npremiums.155  \n                                                 \n155 Covered California, Individual Markets Nationally Face High Premium Increases in Coming \nYears Absent Federal or State Action, With Wide Variation Among States 3 (Mar. 8, 2018), \nhttp://hbex.coveredca.com/data-research/library/CoveredCA_High_Premium_Increases_3-8-\n18.pdf [hereinafter March 2018 Covered California Study].  \n73 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 78 of 134\n \n1.  Shortening Open Enrollment \n140.  As described above, the ACA requires HHS to establish “annual open enrollment \nperiods” during which individuals, via the exchanges, can enroll in new or different health \ninsurance coverage for the coming year. 42 U.S.C. § 18031(c)(6)(B). Outside of open \nenrollment, individuals may enroll in coverage through an exchange only if they qualify for a \nspecial enrollment period, see id. § 18031(c)(6)(C), based on certain life events like getting \nmarried, having a baby, or losing other health coverage. The opportunity to buy insurance \nthrough the exchange is generally limited to established open enrollment periods in order to \nminimize adverse selection. If consumers could buy health insurance through an exchange at any \ntime throughout the year, they could wait until they got sick to purchase insurance and drop it \nonce they recover. \n141.  The 2016 open enrollment period ran from November 1, 2015 through January \n31, 2016.156 Likewise, the 2017 open enrollment period ran from November 1, 2016 through \nJanuary 31, 2017.157 \n142.  In April 2017, however, the Trump Administration announced that it was cutting \nOpen Enrollment for 2018 in half from prior years, setting it to run from November 1, 2017 \n                                                 \n156  2016 Marketplace Open Enrollment Period Public Use Files, CMS, \nhttps://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-\nReports/Marketplace-Products/2016_Open_Enrollment.html.  \n157  CMS, Health Insurance Marketplaces 2017 Open Enrollment Period Final Enrollment \nReport: November 1, 2016 - January 31, 2017 (Mar. 15, 2017), \nhttps://www.cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/Fact-sheets/2017-Fact-Sheet-\nitems/2017-03-15.html.  \n \n74 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 79 of 134\n \nthrough December 15, 2017.158 Shortly thereafter, President Trump tweeted that “ObamaCare is \nin serious trouble” and that “it dies far sooner than anyone would have thought.”159 \n143.  In addition, HHS told community groups that the federal health insurance \nexchange, HealthCare.gov, would be subject to “[p]lanned” “[d]owntime” during the upcoming \nopen enrollment period for an “[o]vernight outage on Wednesday, November 1, 2017”; and on \n“Sundays [from] 12am-12pm ET, except on December 10, 2017”160—a significant increase in \ndowntime from prior years. While the actual downtime proved less than what had been \nannounced, that fact was not communicated, which may have been discouraged enrollment \nduring the times slated for outages. \n144.  HHS has claimed that reducing the open enrollment period will reduce adverse \nselection. 82 Fed. Reg. at 18,353-54. However, HHS has not cited any evidence to show that \nprior open enrollment periods enabled adverse selection, or that shortening the period will reduce \nit. Indeed, experts have found weekly enrollment data inconclusive as to “whether longer \nenrollment windows increase risk for health insurers through adverse selection or decrease risk \nby providing greater opportunities for enrollment by so-called ‘healthy procrastinators.’”161 Still, \nthese experts concluded that “reducing the length of the open enrollment period in 2018 may \n                                                 \n158  CMS, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Market Stabilization, 82 Fed.

And there is broad consensus that later enrollees are, \ngenerally speaking, younger and healthier than earlier enrollees.162 \n145.  There can be no doubt that the Administration’s decision to shorten the 2018 \nenrollment period for FFEs made it more difficult for people to obtain health insurance. Unlike \nthe federal government, nine state-based exchanges opted to maintain a longer 2018 open \nenrollment period than the Administration set for HealthCare.gov. Providing extra time for \npeople to sign up for coverage is but one example of actions SBEs have taken that have resulted \nin increased enrollment and lower premiums there as compared to in FFEs.163 \n146.

Rather, they have purposefully \nundermined the Act—the aim of which is to expand access to quality coverage—in at least two \n                                                 \n162  See id.; Express Scripts, Exchange Pulse: Public Health Exchange and Off-Exchange Report \n2 (Oct. 2014), http://lab.express-scripts.com/lab/insights/government-\nprograms/~/media/68c6ed3d98db484bbb9ac557acafa9de.ashx (finding that those who enroll \nlater during open enrollment periods are, “on average, 4 years younger than early enrollees,” and \nthat they “also have a lower prevalence of chronic conditions, such as heart disease, depression, \nhigh cholesterol and diabetes, and a lower prevalence of specialty conditions, such as cancer and \nmultiple sclerosis”); see also Virgil Dickson, Market Stabilization Rule Could Collapse the ACA \nExchanges, Modern Healthcare, Apr. 14, 2017, \nhttp://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20170414/NEWS/170419910 (surveying experts and \nconcluding that shortening open enrollment will disproportionately affect low-income \nindividuals and limit participation in exchange plans). \n163  Mark A.

First, cutting open enrollment will result in fewer individuals receiving ACA-compliant \nhealth insurance coverage overall, directly undermining the Act’s goal. And second, by \ndecreasing health insurance enrollments, and in particular by decreasing enrollments among \nyounger and healthier populations, cutting open enrollment will weaken health insurance markets \nand increase premiums, ultimately resulting in even fewer individuals being able to access \naffordable health care coverage. \n2.  Cutting Funding for Advertising and Refusing to Publicize Open \nEnrollment \n147.  In keeping with the exchanges’ duty to facilitate enrollment, HHS regulations \nspecify that they “must conduct outreach and education activities . . . to educate consumers about \nthe Exchange and insurance affordability programs to encourage participation.” 45 C.F.R. \n§ 155.205(e). \n148.  In order to comply with this obligation for federally-facilitated exchanges, HHS \nhas, in the past, funded advertising campaigns. In 2016, for example, HHS spent $100 million on \nadvertising to educate consumers about, and promote their enrollment in, health insurance.164  \n149.  So far, President Trump and his Administration have drastically reduced funding \nfor such advertising—twice. \n150.  First, on January 26, 2017—in the waning days of that year’s open enrollment \nperiod—the Administration overruled the objections of career staff and “pull[ed] the plug on all \nObamacare outreach and advertising in the crucial final days of the 2017 enrollment season,” \n                                                 \n164  Timothy Jost, CMS Cuts ACA Advertising by 90 Percent Amid Other Cuts to Enrollment \nOutreach, Health Affairs Blog, Aug. 31, 2017, \nhttp://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20170901.061790/full/. \n \n77 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 82 of 134\n \ncutting funding by $5 million.165 Individuals could still sign up through the January 31, 2017 \ndeadline, but the Administration decided not to “advertis[e] that fact any longer.”166 \nSubsequently, the Office of the Inspector General at HHS determined that the Administration’s \nactions resulted in $1.1 million in unrecoupable costs.167 More importantly, the advertising cuts \nresulted in fewer enrollments—to the tune of 350,000.168 Fewer enrollments mean higher \npremiums. Indeed, the same day his Administration cut ACA advertising by $5 million, \nPresident Trump again promised an ACA “explosion” and that “[n]obody’s going to be able to \nafford” healthcare under the law.169 \n151.  Second, on August 31, 2017, CMS announced that for the open enrollment period \nthat was slated to commence on November 1, 2017, it planned to spend only $10 million on \nadvertising, a 90 percent cut from the prior year.170 CMS further specified that it would “target \n                                                 \n165  Paul Demko, Trump White House Abruptly Halts Obamacare Ads, Politico, Jan. 26, 2017, \nhttp://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trump-white-house-obamacare-ads-234245. \n166  Id. \n167  HHS, Office of the Inspector General, Review of The Department of Health and Human \nServices Cancellation of Marketplace Enrollment Outreach Efforts, OEI-12-17-00290 at 5, \nhttps://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-12-17-00290.pdf. \n168  See Joshua Peck, Trump Blocked Nearly 500,000 People From Getting Coverage, Medium, \nFeb. 2, 2017, https://medium.com/get-america-covered/trumped-blocked-nearly-500-000-people-\nfrom-getting-coverage-70317eedaaa4; Charles Gaba, UPDATED: Want Evidence Trump Killing \nHC.gov Ads Hurt Enrollment?

In justifying its drastic cuts to advertising, Administration officials “pointed to the \nfact that for 2017, even as spending on ads rose, enrollment ended up lower.”173 But as press \nreports pointed out, and as described above, “The Trump [A]dministration . . . withdrew about $5 \nmillion of ads at the end of the 2017 sign-up period, which likely contributed to the enrollment \ndecline.”174 \n153.  The Administration has slashed advertising funding and emphasized digital over \ntelevision-based marketing notwithstanding that—or because—evidence known to HHS \ndemonstrates that robust advertising, and television advertising in particular, is critical to \nfulfilling the ACA’s goal of increasing enrollments in health insurance coverage.175 Indeed, \nstarting in 2015, CMS undertook randomized control trials and econometric modeling to \nmeasure the effectiveness of paid promotional activities and by 2017 concluded that paid \n                                                 \n171  HHS Aug. 31 2017 Announcement, supra n.170, at 1. \n172  Joshua Peck, Trump’s Ad Cuts Will Cost a Minimum of 1.1 Million Obamacare Enrollments, \nMedium, Oct. 23, 2017, https://medium.com/get-america-covered/trumps-ad-cuts-will-cost-a-\nminimum-of-1-1-million-obamacare-enrollments-9334f35c1626.  \n173  Zachary Tracer & Anna Edney, Trump Guts Budget for Obamacare Ads, Bloomberg, Aug. \n31, 2017, https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-31/trump-health-department-is-\nsaid-to-slash-obamacare-ad-budget. \n174  Id. \n175  See id. \n \n79 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 84 of 134\n \noutreach was responsible for 40 percent of all enrollments.176 The agency further found that \ntelevision ads were “the number one driver of enrollment.”177  \n154.  That finding aligns with a study of the effectiveness of advertising in promoting \nenrollment on Kentucky’s Exchange, which found that cuts in advertising during the 2016 open \nenrollment period led to “450,000 fewer page views . . . and 20,000 fewer unique visitors per \nweek” to Kentucky’s state-based marketplace.178  \n155.  Studies also found that the increased volume of television advertisement during \nthe 2014 open enrollment period contributed to increased enrollment and a substantial reduction \nin the uninsured rate.179 States and exchanges that have engaged in their own marketing efforts \nsimilarly report higher enrollment and more stable insurance markets: Covered California reports \nthat its marketing investment has yielded a healthier risk pool, premiums that are 6 to 8 percent \nlower, and greater insurer participation.180 \n                                                 \n176  Lori Lodes, I Ran ACA Outreach Under Obama.

President Trump and his Administration have not only dramatically reduced \noverall funding for advertising under the Affordable Care Act, but also have gone so far as to \nproduce ads that impugn the law and its reforms. In June 2017, HHS produced and posted 23 \nvideo testimonials “from people who said they had been ‘burdened by Obamacare,’ including \nfamilies, health care professionals and small business owners.”181 “While it’s not certain where \nthe money for the videos came from, several former health officials who worked in the Obama \nAdministration said that they suspect it came from the budget meant to promote the Affordable \nCare Act.”182 And when an individual featured in one of the videos “sat down for a recording at \nthe HHS studio he said it ‘felt like they were pushing for a harder line against Obamacare’ than \nhe was delivering.”183 \n157.  Finally, when open enrollment for plan year 2018 began on November 1, 2017, \nneither HHS nor CMS even issued a press release, and the Twitter feeds of the agencies and of \ntheir leadership were silent, in stark contrast to the prior year’s intense push. Such silence is part \nof a pattern: as described above, through multiple changes to its own websites, HHS has \nendeavored to reduce access to information about the ACA.184 And Administration officials have \nindicated that they do not want to promote ACA-compliant plans. \n                                                 \n181  Audrey Carlsen & Haeyoun Park, The Same Agency That Runs Obamacare Is Using \nTaxpayer Money to Undermine It, New York Times, Sept. 4, 2017, \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/04/us/hhs-anti-obamacare-campaign.html?_r=0. \n182  Id. \n183  Sam Stein, Team Trump Used Obamacare Money to Run PR Effort Against It, Daily Beast, \nJuly 20, 2017, https://www.thedailybeast.com/team-trump-used-obamacare-money-to-run-ads-\nagainst-it. \n184  See Charles S.

These actions do not simply represent a choice to spend resources in other ways; \nthe Administration’s own statements show that they were acting to frustrate the goals of the \nACA. Underscoring this is the fact that in the very year that the Administration shortened open \nenrollment, it decreased outreach. By slashing spending on ACA advertising, producing ads \ndesigned to criticize the law, and refusing to publicize open enrollment, Defendants have \nviolated their constitutional obligation to take care that the law is faithfully executed. Rather, \nthey have purposefully undermined the Act—the aim of which is to expand access to quality \ncoverage—in at least three ways. First, the Administration’s advertising choices contradict the \nrequirements of the Act and of its implementing regulations concerning education and outreach. \n42 U.S.C. § 18031(b)(1)(a); 45 C.F.R. § 155.205(e). Second, the Administration’s advertising \nchoices are resulting in fewer individuals receiving health insurance coverage, directly \nundermining the Act’s goal.185 And third, by decreasing health insurance enrollments—\nparticularly among healthier people—the Administration’s advertising choices have weakened \nhealth insurance markets, which ultimately will lead to even fewer individuals being able to \naccess affordable health care coverage. \n3.  Cutting Funding for Navigators and Encouraging Them to Undermine the \nAct \n159.  Twice—in 2017 and 2018—the Trump Administration has drastically cut funding \nfor Navigators working in federally-facilitated exchanges. With its latest round of funding cuts, \nthe Administration has gone even further, commandeering Navigators in its sabotage agenda by \nrequiring them to compete for funding according to how enthusiastically they plan to advertise \n                                                 \n185 Ashley Semanskee et al., Individual Insurance Market Performance in Early 2018, Kaiser \nFamily Foundation (June 26, 2018), https://www.kff.org/private-insurance/issue-\nbrief/individual-insurance-market-performance-in-early-2018/ (finding that these “recent policy \nchanges,” among others, “have the potential to destabilize the individual market generally”). \n82 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 87 of 134\n \nthe availability of non-ACA compliant coverage—i.e., according to their willingness to assist the \nAdministration in siphoning consumers away from the exchanges and convincing them to \npurchase inferior coverage. These decisions exemplify the Administration’s failure to take care \nto faithfully execute the ACA. \n160.  As explained above, the ACA requires exchanges to award grants to Navigators, \n42 U.S.C. § 18031(i), who must maintain a current understanding of available health insurance \noptions, conduct public education and awareness campaigns, help consumers understand their \nchoices, facilitate consumers’ health insurance decisions, and ensure their access to consumer \nprotections, see id. § 18031(i)(3); 45 C.F.R. §§ 155.210, 155.215. To ensure that exchanges run \nby the federal government comply with the requirement that all exchanges establish Navigator \nprograms, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. §§ 18031(d)(4)(K), 18031(i)(1); 45 C.F.R. §§ 155.205(d)(1), \n155.210(a), HHS enters into cooperative agreements with Navigators.186 \n161.  In the ACA, Congress recognized the importance of expert assistance, both to \nindividuals and for the functioning of the exchanges. Navigators play vitally important roles at \nevery step, from helping consumers make informed health insurance decisions to facilitating \ntheir applications and enrollment, thereby contributing to the success of the exchanges—and of \nthe Act itself—overall. For example, one study concluded that “[t]he strongest overall predictor \nof completing the [insurance] application process was receiving assistance from a [N]avigator or \n                                                 \n186 See, e.g., HHS, Cooperative Agreement to Support Navigators in Federally-facilitated and \nState Partnership Marketplaces, Funding Opportunity No. CA-NAV-15-001 (Apr. 15, 2015) \nhttps://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Programs-and-Initiatives/Health-Insurance-\nMarketplaces/Downloads/Navigator_2015_FOA_FINAL_04_15_2015.pdf [hereinafter 2015 \nFOA]; see generally In-Person Assistance in the Health Insurance Marketplaces, CMS, \nhttps://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Programs-and-Initiatives/Health-Insurance-\nMarketplaces/assistance.html (describing the “FFE Navigator program”). \n \n83 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 88 of 134\n \nsocial worker.”187 Additional research has documented that Hispanic and low-income individuals \ndisproportionately rely on direct assistance from Navigators and other entities when making \nhealth insurance coverage decisions.188 Other experts have established the importance of the \nbroad range of Navigators’ duties for consumers and for exchanges.189 \n162.  When issuing the 2015 Funding Opportunity Announcement, HHS estimated that \nit “expect[ed] to award up to $201,000,000 over the three-year project period and up to \n$67,000,000 during the first 12-month budget period.” 2015 FOA, supra n.186, at 11. Indeed, in \n2015, HHS reported awarding $67 million in grants under the FFE Navigator program.190 And in \n2016, HHS reported issuing continuation awards totaling “over $62.5 million” under the \nprogram.191  \n                                                 \n187  Benjamin D.

Until late summer 2017, final preparations were underway to fund the HHS \nNavigator program at a similar level for the 2018 open enrollment—$60 million.192  \n164.  Final preparations were also underway until late summer 2017 to allocate funding \nfor the 2018 open enrollment according to the process and criteria described in the 2015 FOA. In \na memo signed on August 23, 2017, agency staff explained that individual grantees’ continuation \naward amounts for 2017 had been calculated “based on performance evaluations conducted by \n[CMS project officers] and [CMS regional office liaisons],” which were based on the \n“performance factors outlined in the 2015 FOA” and grantees’ “progress toward the goals \noutlined in their 2016 Non-Competing Continuation Application.”193 \n165.  But at the direction of political appointees at the agency, HHS abruptly changed \ncourse. In an August 31, 2017 announcement, HHS announced an entirely “new funding \nformula”—nowhere to be found in the operative 2015 FOA, nor in the relevant statutes or \nregulations—whereby “Navigator grantees will receive funding based” solely “on their ability to \nmeet their enrollment goals during the previous year.” HHS Aug. 31, 2017 Announcement, supra \nn.170, at 1. “For example, a grantee that achieved 100 percent of its enrollment goal for plan \nyear 2017 will receive the same level of funding as last year, while a grantee that enrolled only \n                                                 \n192  See Memorandum from Randy Pate, Director, CCIIO, to Janet Loftus, Director, Division of \nAccounting Operations, CMS, regarding Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act—\nCooperative Agreement Funds (dated Aug. 24, 2017; stamped Aug. 31, 2017), \nhttp://acasignups.net/17/09/04/exclusive-i-believe-whats-called-scoop (confirming that $60 \nmillion was appropriated on August 31, 2017); Memorandum from Gian Johnson, Acting \nDirector, Division of Assister Programs, Consumer Support Group, CCIIO, to Jennifer Beeson, \nDirector, Consumer Support Group, CCIIO, regarding Funding and Decision Memo- Request for \nApproval to Award Year 3 Funding for Cooperative Agreement to Support Navigators in \nFederally-facilitated and State Partnership Exchanges 2 (signed Aug. 23, 2017), \nhttp://acasignups.net/17/09/04/exclusive-i-believe-whats-called-scoop [hereinafter Aug. 23, 2017 \nMemo] (“The Navigator program received $60 million for grant awards in FY 2017….”). \n193  Aug. 23, 2017 Memo, supra n.192, at 2. \n85 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 90 of 134\n \n70 percent of its enrollment goal would receive 70 percent of its previous year funding level, a \nreduction of 30 percent.” Id. \n166.  Although HHS announced its new funding formula one day before the then-\ncurrent budget period expired, on September 1, 2017, the agency waited almost two weeks, until \nSeptember 13, 2017, to issue notices of awards to grantees under its new funding formula. \nAccordingly, because “[e]ntities and individuals cannot serve as federally certified Navigators \nwithout receiving federal grant funding to perform Navigator duties,” 2015 FOA, supra n.186, at \n7, by delaying issuance of notices of award until September 13, 2017, HHS eliminated Navigator \nprograms in FFEs from September 2-12, 2017, further violating the ACA’s requirements.  \n167.  HHS’s 2017 funding formula resulted in a nearly 40 percent decrease in overall \nfunding for the FFE Navigator program, to about $36 million.194 Some individual Navigators \nsaw cuts as high as 92 percent.195 \n168.  But HHS’s 2017 cuts to Navigator funding pale in comparison to those the agency \nannounced in 2018. On July 10, 2018, HHS released a new funding opportunity announcement \nfor the FFE Navigator program and stated that it “expects to award up to $10 million”196—\n                                                 \n194  See Robert King, Trump Cuts Obamacare Ad Budget By 90 Percent, Washington Examiner, \nAug. 31, 2017, http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/trump-cuts-obamacare-ad-budget-by-90-\npercent/article/2633128; Press Release, CMS, CMS Announces New Funding Opportunity \nAnnouncement for the Federally-Facilitated Exchange Navigator Program (July 10, 2018), \nhttps://www.cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/Press-releases/2018-Press-releases-\nitems/2018-07-10-2.html. \n195  See Juliet Eilperin & Amy Goldstein, HHS Slashes Funding to Groups Helping ACA \nConsumers Enroll by up to 92 Percent, Washington Post, Sept. 14, 2017, \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/hhs-slashes-funding-to-some-aca-\nnavigator-groups-by-more-than-60-percent/2017/09/14/729c394c-9957-11e7-b569-\n3360011663b4_story.html?utm_term=.f7910e0bc711. \n196  CMS, Press Release, CMS Announces New Funding Opportunity Announcement for the \nFederally-Facilitated Exchange Navigator Program (July 10, 2018), \n \n86 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 91 of 134\n \nmerely one-fourth the amount of funding provided for the prior year, and one-sixth the amount of \nfunding provided for the year before that. Notwithstanding Navigators’ important place in the \nACA’s statutory scheme and their vital role in facilitating enrollment, HHS has unlawfully \narrogated to itself the authority to decide that their services are no longer important.197 \n169.  Yet drastically reducing Navigator funding in FFEs was not enough. HHS also \ninstructed applicants to compete for the limited funding available by “demonstrat[ing] how they \nprovide information to people who may be unaware of the range of available coverage options in \naddition to qualified health plans . . . such as association health plans, short-term, limited-\nduration insurance, and health reimbursement arrangements.”198 This means that Navigators will \nnow use funds that Congress designated to support the ACA for the opposite purpose—to \nundermine it. The Act is clear: Navigators must “conduct public education activities to raise \nawareness of the availability of qualified health plans,” “distribute fair and impartial information \nconcerning enrollment in qualified health plans,” and “facilitate enrollment in qualified health \nplans.” 42 U.S.C. § 18031(i)(3) (emphasis added). HHS’s decision to incentivize Navigators to \npush plans designed to siphon consumers away from ACA exchanges, thus weakening them does \nnot faithfully implement the ACA but rather undermines it. \n170.  By slashing funding for Navigators and encouraging them to advertise non-ACA \ncompliant plans, Defendants have violated their constitutional obligation to take care that the \nACA is faithfully executed. Rather, they have purposefully undermined the Act—the aim of \nwhich is to expand access to quality coverage—in at least two ways.

And second, by decreasing health insurance \nenrollments, reducing funding for Navigators will weaken health insurance markets and increase \npremiums, ultimately resulting in even fewer individuals being able to access affordable health \ncare coverage. \n4.  Refusing to Participate in Enrollment Events and Other Outreach \n171.  To effectuate the ACA’s education and outreach mandates, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \n§ 18031(b)(1)(a); see also 45 C.F.R. § 155.205(e), in prior years HHS officials participated in \nenrollment events around the country.199 That changed dramatically in 2017. During that \nsummer, the Trump Administration ended contracts that provided outreach, and that brought \nenrollment assistance to libraries, businesses, and urban neighborhoods, in 18 cities.200 The \nAdministration stopped coordinating enrollment efforts with the Latino Affordable Care Act \nCoalition, a group of local and national organizations that assisted with every previous open \nenrollment period,201 and a number of other organizations as well.202 The Administration stopped \nsending staff to regional enrollment events.203 After being informed that HHS would no longer \n                                                 \n199  Kate Nocera & Paul McLeod, The Trump Administration Is Pulling Out Of Obamacare \nEnrollment Events, Buzzfeed, Sept. 27, 2017, https://www.buzzfeed.com/katenocera/the-trump-\nadministration-wont-support-state-obamacare. \n200  Carla K.

By cutting back on enrollment events and other outreach, Defendants have \nviolated their constitutional obligation to take care that the ACA is faithfully executed. Rather, \nthey have purposefully undermined the Act—the aim of which is to expand access to quality \ncoverage—in at least two ways. First, cutting back on enrollment events and outreach will result \nin fewer individuals receiving ACA-compliant health insurance coverage overall, directly \nundermining the Act’s goal. And second, by decreasing health insurance enrollments, cutting \nback on enrollment events and outreach will weaken health insurance markets and increase \npremiums, ultimately resulting in even fewer individuals being able to access affordable health \ncare coverage. \n  Refusing to Defend the Act \n173.

Indeed,  \na range of considerations, including the distinctive capacities of the executive \nbranch, the nature of relations between career lawyers and political appointees in \nthe government, the virtues of institutional continuity within the executive branch, \nand the relationship between the executive branch and Congress, reinforce the \nwisdom of the conventional practice of providing a defense even of statutes that \nthe incumbent administration views as offensive and possibly invalid. \n \nId. at 1186-87. \n174.

More troublingly, it is a dramatic example of how Defendants are eager to \ninvalidate, rather than to implement, core ACA provisions. Because of Defendants’ decision, \nconsumers and other stakeholders cannot fully rely on the ACA’s guaranteed-issue and \ncommunity-rating provisions, which are essential to ensuring that individuals with preexisting \nconditions can obtain necessary insurance coverage. \nDEFENDANTS’ UNLAWFUL ACTIONS ARE HARMING PLAINTIFFS \n176.  Although the ACA has proven more resilient than Defendants might have hoped, \nDefendants’ actions are taking a toll. Through all the mechanisms described above, Defendants’ \nactions are aimed at weakening insurance markets; they are making it harder and more expensive \nfor consumers and small businesses to procure health insurance coverage; and they are driving \nup the size of the uninsured and underinsured populations. Local governments and individuals \nnationwide, including Plaintiffs in this case, are paying the price. \nI.  Defendants’ Unlawful Actions Are Causing Premiums to Rise and the Rate of the \nUninsured to Increase \n177.  The myriad ways in which Defendants’ actions cause premiums to rise, \nenrollment in ACA exchanges to drop, and the rate of the uninsured to increase, are described \nabove, action by action. As detailed below, the overall consequences are being felt now and, \nwithout intervention, will worsen. \n178.  The executive actions at issue here are making it harder for Americans to afford \nand purchase quality health insurance, in part by increasing premiums for plans on the ACA \nexchanges. According to one analysis, “absent” various “policy changes,” including the actions \nchallenged here, “it is likely that insurers would generally have required only modest premium \n91 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 96 of 134\n \nincreases” from 2017 to 2018, and from 2018 to 2019 “as well.”209 But as a result of Defendants’ \nactions and other factors, premiums are increasing substantially. The Congressional Budget \nOffice has estimated that the average premium for a benchmark ACA plan for 2018 is about 37 \npercent higher than it was in 2017.210 One analysis concluded that “a substantial portion” of such \nrate increases was “due to political and regulatory factors that arose in 2017”—including the \nTrump Administration decisions at issue here.211 Insurers have agreed: the press reported that in \nMay 2017, “[h]ealth insurers across the country [were] making plans to dramatically raise \nObamacare premiums or exit marketplaces amid growing exasperation with the Trump \n[A]dministration’s erratic management of the program and its conflicting signals about the fate \nof aid for low-income consumers and other key issues.”212 \n179.  Looking ahead, according to an assessment by Covered California, in 2019, \nstatewide average premium increases for ACA plans could range from 12 to 32 percent, with \nadditional increases of 10 to 21 percent expected in both 2020 and 2021.213 “Cumulatively, these \npremium increases would average 50 percent over the three-year period, with a projected range \n                                                 \n209  Cynthia Cox et al., Individual Insurance Market Performance in 2017, Kaiser Family \nFoundation (May 17, 2018), https://www.kff.org/private-insurance/issue-brief/individual-\ninsurance-market-performance-in-2017/.  \n210  May 2018 CBO Report, supra n.9, at 2. \n211  Mark Hall, Stabilizing and Strengthening the Individual Health Insurance Market: A View \nfrom Ten States 4, USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy (July 2018), \nhttps://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Stabilizing-and-Strenghtening-the-\nIndividual-Health-Insurance-Market2.pdf; see also May 2018 CBO Report, supra n.9, at 2. \n212  See, e.g., Noam N.

The Urban Institute has calculated that some of Defendants’ actions will contribute to \nan increase of over 18 percent in premiums for ACA-compliant plans in most states.215 The \nKaiser Family Foundation, in reviewing proposed premiums for 2019, also found evidence that \nthey are substantially higher than they would otherwise have been because of Defendants’ \nactions.216 Indeed, a review of proposed premiums found insurers citing “[t]he increase in the \noverall sickness of the risk pool,” which they attribute “to ACA-related policy changes that lead \nto the loss of young and healthy enrollees,” as driving recent increases.217 These increases reflect \nthe concern in insurance markets that the executive actions under review here have caused. Such \nconcern has also resulted in insurers exiting ACA exchanges entirely.218 For example, in \ndiscussing whether to stay in ACA exchanges, the CEO of CareFirst Blue Cross Blue Shield, the \n                                                 \n214  Id. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the average premium for a \nbenchmark ACA plan for 2019 will increase by 15 percent, and will further increase by an \naverage of about 7 percent per year between 2019 and 2028.

Increased premiums lead to an increase in the rate of the uninsured and \nunderinsured.220 So just as the rate of the uninsured fell as a result of the Affordable Care Act’s \nfaithful implementation in its initial years, that rate appears to be on the rise again, thanks in part \nto Defendants’ actions. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the number of \nuninsured Americans under age 65 has risen by 2 million between 2016 and 2018.221 The overall \ndecline in enrollment in ACA-compliant plans from its 2016 peak, particularly among those not \neligible for subsidies, is contributing to this trend.222 \n                                                 \n219  Paige Winfield Cunningham, The Health 202: Leading Obamacare Insurer Says Things Are \n‘Materially Worse’ Under Trump Administration, Washington Post, May 1, 2018 \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-health-202/2018/05/01/the-health-\n202-leading-obamacare-insurer-says-things-are-materially-worse-under-trump-\nadministration/5ae76f2230fb04371192693b/?utm_term=.d54f46a7a0a1.  \n220 It has long been understood that among the most important reasons why the uninsured lack \ncoverage is the unaffordability of coverage. See, e.g., supra ¶ 38 (citing CMS’s statement); KFF \nKey Facts, supra n.18 (“Even under the ACA, many uninsured people cite the high cost of \ninsurance as the main reason they lack coverage. In 2016, 45% of uninsured adults said that they \nremained uninsured because the cost of coverage was too high.”); M. Susan Marquis et al., \nConsumer Decision Making In The Individual Health Insurance Market, Health Affairs \n(May/June 2006), https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.25.w226 (“Affordability \nof insurance is believed to be the most important reason that the uninsured lack coverage . . . .”). \n221  See Congressional Budget Office, Federal Subsidies for Health Insurance Coverage for \nPeople Under Age 65: 2016 to 2026 at 2 (March 2016), \nhttps://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/114th-congress-2015-2016/reports/51385-\nhealthinsurancebaselineonecol.pdf; May 2018 CBO Report, supra n.9, at 1, 5. \n222  Press Release, CMS, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Releases Reports on the \nPerformance of the Exchanges and Individual Health Insurance Market (July 2, 2018), \nhttps://www.cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/Press-releases/2018-Press-releases-\nitems/2018-07-02.html; see also May 2018 CBO Report, supra n.9, at 1, 5 (reporting that for \n2018, a monthly average of about 9 million people under age 65 will be insured through \nnongroup plans purchased on ACA exchanges, a decline from 2017, when the estimated monthly \naverage was 10 million); Ashley Semanskee et al., Data Note: Changes in Enrollment in the \n \n94 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 99 of 134\n \n181.  Specifically, “[a]fter peaking in 2016 at 12.7 million, there was an approximately \n3.9 [percent] decline in ACA marketplace insurance enrollment in 2017” nationwide,223 and from \n2017 to 2018, enrollment dropped by an additional 3.7 percent overall, and by 5.3 percent in \nstates with federally-facilitated exchanges.224 And while the primary government survey found \nno change in the overall rate of the uninsured through the end of 2017,225 preliminary \ninformation for 2018 suggests it is climbing. For example, one survey found that the uninsured \nrate among working-age people had risen to 15.5 percent by March 2018, up from 12.7 percent \nas of April 2016—meaning that about 4 million working-age people lost insurance coverage.226 \nAmong the likely causes? For all the reasons described above, some of the very actions at issue \n                                                 \nIndividual Health Insurance Market 3, Kaiser Family Foundation (July 2018), \nhttp://files.kff.org/attachment/Data-Note-Changes-in-Enrollment-in-the-Individual-Health-\nInsurance-Market (reporting that enrollment in ACA-compliant plans peaked at 11.1 million in \n2016 and dropped to 10.6 million in the first quarter of 2018). \n223  Dan Witters, Uninsured Rate Rises in 17 States in 2017, Gallup, May 9, 2018, \nhttps://news.gallup.com/poll/233597/uninsured-rate-rises-states-2017.aspx (citing data from \nCMS). \n224  Press Release, Kaiser Family Foundation, National ACA Marketplace Signups Dipped a \nModest 3.7 Percent This Year (Feb. 7, 2018), https://www.kff.org/health-reform/press-\nrelease/national-aca-marketplace-signups-dipped-a-modest-3-7-percent-this-\nyear/?utm_source=link_newsv9&utm_campaign=item_233597&utm_medium=copy.  \n225  Robin A.

An analysis by Gallup and \nSharecare, however, found that the rate of the uninsured rose by 1.3 percent from the last quarter \nof 2016 to the last quarter of 2017—the “largest single-year increase Gallup and Sharecare have \nmeasured since beginning to track the rate in 2008, including the period before the [ACA] went \ninto effect.” Zac Auter, U.S. Uninsured Rate Steady at 12.2% in Fourth Quarter of 2017, Gallup, \nJan. 16, 2018, https://news.gallup.com/poll/225383/uninsured-rate-steady-fourth-quarter-\n2017.aspx. \n226  Sara R.

These problems will only grow if the Trump Administration’s sabotage efforts are \nnot stopped. The Congressional Budget Office has projected that, between 2018 and 2019, the \nnumber of people enrolled in health insurance through the nongroup market—including plans \npurchased on ACA exchanges and otherwise—will decrease by 3 million, in part because \n“premiums faced by people who are ineligible for subsidies in the nongroup market will be \nhigher.”228 \nII.  Defendants’ Unlawful Actions Harm the City Plaintiffs by Forcing Them to Spend \nMore on Uncompensated Care \n183.  The City Plaintiffs—and, for that matter, many other cities and counties \nnationwide—are being harmed by Defendants’ unlawful attempts to undermine the ACA, and \nthey will continue to be harmed as long as Defendants’ unlawful actions stand. By driving up the \nrate of uninsured or underinsured individuals within the City Plaintiffs’ jurisdictions, \nDefendants’ actions force the City Plaintiffs to devote additional funding, personnel, and other \nresources to subsidizing and providing uncompensated care for their residents. Defendants’ \nactions thereby hit the City Plaintiffs’ budgets, including the budgets for their public health \ndepartments, free or reduced-cost clinics, and ambulance services. \n184.  Fulfilling their responsibility to care for their residents, local governments often \nprovide a variety of health services to those who, lacking adequate health insurance, cannot \n                                                 \n227  Id. \n228  May 2018 CBO Report, supra n.9, at 5, 14. \n96 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 101 of 134\n \notherwise pay for medical treatment. For that reason, “local governments (municipalities, \ncounties, and special-purpose health or hospital districts) bear a large share of the direct \nfinancing of public hospital and clinic services.”229 In 2013, state and local governments spent \n$19.8 billion to cover the costs of uncompensated care.230 As a result, an increase in “the number \nof uninsured and the amount of uncompensated care . . . will translate into increased pressure on \nstate and local government to finance the growing cost of the uninsured.”231  \n185.  Moreover, “compared to the insured population, the uninsured are more likely to \nskip or postpone needed care due to cost, miss preventative care, and be diagnosed with cancer at \nlater stages resulting in earlier death.”232 Then, “when uninsured persons do use services, they \nare likely to need more costly health services because of delays in seeking care.”233 There is, \ntherefore, a direct relationship between increases in the uninsured population and increased costs \nfor government, including local government.234 \n                                                 \n229  Institute of Medicine, A Shared Destiny: Community Effects of Uninsurance 128 (2003), \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK221329/ [hereinafter IOM Shared Destiny]. \n230  Patrick Kaiser & Eric Cochling, Increasing Access to Quality Healthcare for Low-Income \nUninsured Georgians Policy Recommendations for the State of Georgia 12, Georgia Center for \nOpportunity (June 2014), https://georgiaopportunity.org/assets/2014/06/Charity-Care-Report.pdf. \n231  John Holahan & Bowen Garnett, The Cost of Uncompensated Care With and Without Health \nReform 4, Urban Institute (Mar. 2010), \nhttps://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/28431/412045-The-Cost-of-\nUncompensated-Care-with-and-without-Health-Reform.PDF; see also Erin F.

Costs like these—costs institutions bear as a result of providing uncompensated \ncare—motivated the passage of the ACA. In the Act itself, Congress observed the astronomical \ncosts “of providing uncompensated care to the uninsured”: “$43,000,000,000 in 2008.” 42 \nU.S.C. § 18091(2)(F). Congress also noted that individuals who choose “to forego health \ninsurance coverage and attempt to self-insure . . . increase[] financial risks to households and \nmedical providers.” Id. § 18091(2)(A). Indeed, during the debates over the Act, members of \nCongress frequently referred to the need to reduce the costs that providers face because of \nuncompensated care.235 And in explaining his Administration’s health care reform agenda in a \nspeech to the U.S. Conference of Mayors in 2009, President Obama highlighted the need for \naction because, among other things, “spiraling health care costs” were “straining budgets across \ngovernment.”236 In sum, there is no doubt that reducing the financial burden upon entities that \nprovide health services, including cities, was one of the core aims of the ACA. \n                                                 \n23, 2018), https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/uncompensated-care-costs-fell-in-nearly-every-\nstate-as-acas-major-coverage. \n235  See, e.g., 155 Cong.

The City Plaintiffs operate or subsidize free or reduced-cost health care centers \nand clinics, which “have patients who are primarily uninsured, rely on volunteers and resources \nof the community, and face persistent financial struggles.”237 “The primary reason for using a \nfree clinic is lack of insurance.”238 For example, one study found that nearly 50 percent of the \nindividuals who use publicly funded sexually transmitted infection clinics are uninsured.239 \nSimilarly, uninsured individuals primarily rely on free or reduced-cost immunization clinics to \nobtain necessary vaccinations.240  \n188.  The City Plaintiffs will have to bear greater costs to maintain their health care \ncenters and clinics if the number of uninsured or underinsured individuals increases. There is a \ndirect relationship between the uninsured rate in a given state and the rate of uninsured visits for \nwhich the clinic does not receive full compensation.

The City Plaintiffs also operate or subsidize ambulance services, which answer \nemergency calls regardless of whether the individual needing care has health insurance. Studies \nhave shown that “the uninsured . . . disproportionately rely on ambulance service for transport to \nthe [emergency department].”243 As the number of uninsured or underinsured individuals \nincreases, ambulance services will have to respond to a larger number of calls for which they \ncannot seek reimbursement from insurers. Thus, the ambulance service and, by extension, the \ncity that runs or subsidizes the service, is left to absorb the increased costs. \n190.  The City Plaintiffs must address these budgetary shortfalls, and must do so in \nways that impose still greater costs on cities and their residents. “Public subsidy of \nuncompensated care delivered to uninsured persons requires that additional public revenues be \nraised, resulting in a higher tax burden at the local level, the receipt of monies from federal \n                                                 \n241  Heather Angier et al., An Early Look at Rates of Uninsured Safety Net Clinic Visits After the \nAffordable Care Act, 13 Annals of Family Med. 10, 10 (Jan.-Feb. 2015), \nhttps://www.annemergmed.com/article/S0196-0644(10)00384-7/fulltext. \n242  Joseph Jaafari, The Demand for Volunteer Physicians Is Rising.

Aside from the direct impact on their public safety and health departments, the \nCity Plaintiffs will have to confront the many downstream effects of a population that is \nnecessarily sicker, less productive, and less able to participate in the community and civic life. \nMultiple studies have shown that “in areas with many uninsured people, the quality of care was \nlower, as well,” in part because “it is difficult for health providers to maintain services in areas \nwith large numbers of patients who cannot pay for care.”245 More broadly, “[f]or the \ncommunities in which uninsured individuals and families live, the lack or loss of health \ninsurance coverage by some may undermine the shared economic and social foundations of the \nentire community.”246 \n192.  The effects will be felt throughout the City Plaintiffs’ budgets. As one mayor has \nput it, “if people don’t get the medical care they need, it’s going to be city fire departments and \npolice departments responding to preventable emergencies.”247 Public school teachers will have \n                                                 \n244  IOM Shared Destiny, supra n.229, at 123. \n245  Julie Rovner, Millions More Uninsured Could Impact Health of Those With Insurance, Too, \nKaiser Health News, July 14, 2018, https://khn.org/news/millions-more-uninsured-could-impact-\nhealth-of-those-with-insurance-too/. \n246   IOM Shared Destiny, supra n.229, at 120.  \n247  Sara Durr, The Nation’s Mayors Stress Impact of Affordable Care Act Repeal, U.S. \nConference of Mayors (Jan. 25, 2017), https://www.usmayors.org/2017/01/25/the-nations-\nmayors-stress-impact-of-affordable-care-act-repeal/ (statement of Mesa, Ariz., Mayor John \nGiles). \n \n101 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 106 of 134\n \nto deal with students that either miss school or come to school and spread illnesses to other \nstudents.248 And other social services departments will face increased demand for public benefits.  \n193.  The City Plaintiffs’ economies will suffer too: “An increasing or high uninsured \nrate, and the attendant high public costs, may discourage employers from locating or continuing \nto make their home in a community.”249 Moreover, “the uneven availability of workplace health \nbenefits keeps workers ‘locked in’ to their jobs if they already have coverage through their \nemployer,” inhibiting growth and dynamism in the City Plaintiffs’ economies.250 For example, \nemployees may be unwilling to move to a new job or start a new business, and thereby forego \nemployer-provided health insurance, if doing so forces them to purchase costly insurance on the \nindividual market. \n194.  All of these costs—budgetary, economic, political, and social—are being borne \nby each of the City Plaintiffs in this case. \n  Columbus, Ohio \n195.  The City of Columbus will be harmed in at least three ways by the rise in the rates \nof the uninsured and underinsured caused by Defendants’ unlawful actions: it will be forced to \npay more to support community health centers that serve its uninsured residents, its ambulance \nsystem will face greater unrecouped costs from calls by uninsured and underinsured individuals, \n                                                 \n248  Press Release, U.S. Department of Education, Obama Administration Encourages Schools \nand Districts to Enroll Students in Health Care Coverage Through School Registration (Aug. 31, \n2016), https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/obama-administration-encourages-schools-and-\ndistricts-enroll-students-health-care-coverage-through-school-registration (“Research shows that \nchildren who have access to health coverage are more likely to graduate from high school and \ncollege than uninsured children.”). \n249  IOM Shared Destiny, supra n.229, at 130. \n250  Id. \n \n102 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 107 of 134\n \nand it will suffer all of the downstream costs of a population that is necessarily sicker and less \nproductive. \n196.  To start, Columbus has a public health department, Columbus Public Health, \nwhich “is charged with assuring conditions in which people can be healthy.” Columbus Public \nHealth “is made up of a range of programs providing clinical, environmental, health promotion, \nand population-based services,”251 and has an annual budget of approximately $56 million and is \nstaffed by 490 full- and part-time employees. \n197.  Columbus Public Health subsidizes a number of community health centers that, as \ndescribed above, will face greater demand from uninsured or underinsured individuals who \ncannot obtain health care elsewhere. In 2017, these community health centers saw a total of \n45,616 patients. In total, these centers have an annual budget of approximately $38 million.  \n198.  Most importantly, Columbus Public Health financially supports PrimaryOne \nHealth, which is a collection of ten Columbus neighborhood health centers in medically \nunderserved areas.252 PrimaryOne is designed to be a “system of health center sites throughout \nColumbus and Franklin County to serve the health care needs of vulnerable, un/under and \ninsured residents within the community.”253 \n199.  In 2017, Columbus subsidized PrimaryOne with $4,367,145 in public funds. That \nsame year, the centers served over 45,000 patients. This included more than 15,000 uninsured \npatients, an increase of almost 3,000 more uninsured patients than the year before. In contrast, \n                                                 \n251  About Columbus Public Health, City of Columbus, \nhttps://www.columbus.gov/publichealth/About-Columbus-Public-Health/. \n252  The History of PrimaryOne Health, PrimaryOne, http://www.primaryonehealth.org/about/.  \n253  Id. \n103 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 108 of 134\n \nthe number of uninsured patients dropped from 17,752 in 2013 to 14,272 in 2014, after the \nindividual mandate took effect. \n200.  If the rate of uninsured or underinsured individuals increases, then the \nPrimaryOne Health centers will necessarily see even more patients, and Columbus will either \nhave to provide them with additional funding or let them decrease the range of services they are \nable to provide. See supra ¶ 188. \n201.  Columbus Public Health also operates a number of specialty clinics for alcohol \nand drug abuse prevention, dental services, family planning, immunizations, sexual health, \ntuberculosis control, women, infants, and children nutrition, and women’s health and wellness.254 \nEach of these clinics operates on a free or reduced-fee scale and principally serves the uninsured \nand underinsured populations.255 As with PrimaryOne Health, growth in the uninsured and \nunderinsured population will translate to additional costs for Columbus. \n202.  Columbus also maintains “one of the best Emergency Medical Services (EMS) in \nthe United States,” operated by the Columbus Division of Fire.256 That system dispatches \nambulances to meet urgent health needs, regardless of whether the call comes from an individual \nwho has health insurance or is otherwise able to pay for the call. In 2017, the Columbus Division \nof Fire answered over 132,000 emergency medic calls and had a budget of over $240 million. \n                                                 \n254  About Columbus Public Health, City of Columbus, \nhttps://www.columbus.gov/publichealth/About-Columbus-Public-Health/. \n255  See, e.g., Dental Clinic, City of Columbus, \nhttps://www.columbus.gov/publichealth/programs/Dental-Clinic/.  \n256  Division of Fire, City of Columbus, https://www.columbus.gov/public-\nsafety/fire/reports/EMS-Reports/. \n \n104 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 109 of 134\n \n203.  If possible, “[r]eimbursement for the expense of emergency ambulance transport \nis sought from a patient’s Medicare, Medicaid, or commercial health insurance coverage.”257 If \nan individual “live[s] in the City of Columbus and do[es] not have health insurance coverage, \n[they] will not receive a bill for transport”; thus, “no Columbus resident will pay anything ‘out of \npocket’ as the result of being transported to a hospital by The Columbus Division of Fire.”258 \nIndeed, while Columbus recoups from 40 to 80 percent of its costs for transports for individuals \nwith private insurance, Columbus only recoups less than 4 percent of its costs for uninsured \nindividuals. For that reason, reimbursements “in no way cover all the costs incurred for treatment \nand transport.”259 \n204.  As explained above, an increase in the number of uninsured or underinsured \nindividuals will result in more transports for which Columbus does not receive reimbursement \nand thus must make up for the shortfall in its budget. See supra ¶ 189. Indeed, Columbus’s data \nshows that this concern is far from speculative: In 2014, after the individual mandate took effect, \nthe number of uninsured transports dropped from 11,123 to 7,943—a decrease of 29 percent. \nSince then, uninsured transports have remained flat. As the uninsured rate goes up again, \nhowever, Columbus can expect to provide additional unreimbursed transports, which will be paid \nfor out of Columbus’s own coffers. \n205.  Aside from these budgetary impacts, Columbus—a city of nearly 900,000 people, \nwith an economy of $132 billion—is harmed by the need to care for a population that becomes \nincreasingly uninsured and less healthy. As explained above, an increase in the rate of uninsured \n                                                 \n257  Id. \n258  Id. \n259  Id. \n105 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 110 of 134\n \nand underinsured individuals will impose additional drains on the city’s budget and its personnel, \nand will make the city a less attractive place to live and work.  \n206.  Each of these harms is traceable to Defendants’ unlawful actions. As explained \nabove, Defendants’ actions increase the rate of the uninsured and underinsured, which in turn \naffects Columbus’s budget and diminishes Columbus’s economic prospects. Indeed, the Urban \nInstitute projects that Defendants’ sabotage efforts, among other factors, will cause enrollment in \nACA-compliant plans to decrease in Ohio by 31.6 percent for 2019—45.6 percent if expanded \naccess to short-term policies is factored in260—thus increasing the rate of the uninsured and the \nunderinsured. That is unsurprising, given that one study estimates that Ohio has a “catastrophic \nrisk” of a potential 90 percent premium increase.261 Moreover, Columbus, and surrounding \nFranklin County, tend to have a higher rate of uninsured individuals than Ohio overall.262 \nColumbus is therefore particularly vulnerable to Defendants’ attempts to sabotage the ACA and \nthe resulting increase in the rate of uninsured. By the same token, each of these harms will be \nredressed by countermanding the challenged provisions of the 2019 Rule specifically and \nDefendants’ sabotage of the ACA more generally. \n  Baltimore, Maryland \n207.  The City of Baltimore, Maryland, will be harmed in many of the same ways as \nColumbus. By increasing the rate of uninsured and underinsured individuals, Defendants’ actions \nwill make it costlier for Baltimore to support its health clinics and other programs; they will \n                                                 \n260 March 2018 Urban Institute Study, supra n.116, at 11. \n261 March 2018 Covered California Post, supra n.155. \n262  See 2017 Community Health Assessment 2-5, Columbus, Worthington, Franklin County \n(Sept. 2017), https://www.columbus.gov/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=2147499258; \nSelected Characteristics of Health Insurance Coverage in the United States, U.S. Census Bureau \n(2016), https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk \n(select table and enter “Ohio” and “Columbus city, Ohio”). \n106 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 111 of 134\n \nlikewise force Baltimore to spend more to cover unrecouped costs from city ambulance calls; \nand Baltimore, too, will suffer the many harms associated with a population that is necessarily \nless healthy. \n208.  “The Baltimore City Health Department is the oldest continuously-operating \nhealth department in the United States, formed in 1793.” It is charged with “working to improve \nthe health and well-being of Baltimore residents”—and thereby “make Baltimore a city where all \nresidents realize their full health potential.” To that end, the department “has a wide-ranging area \nof responsibility,” including matters like acute communicable diseases, chronic disease \nprevention, HIV/STD, maternal-child health, school health, and senior services. It is staffed by \napproximately 800 employees and has an annual budget of approximately $126 million.263 \n209.  In particular, the Baltimore City Health Department operates a number of \nspecialty clinics out of two principal facilities. These include clinics for reproductive health, \nsexually transmitted diseases, dental and oral health care, and immunizations.264 The department \nalso subsidizes a Men’s Health Center, which operates out of space provided at one of the \ndepartment’s own facilities.265 Each of these clinics provides services on a free or reduced-fee \nscale and therefore serves as an essential resource for the uninsured and underinsured \npopulations.266 Consequently, any growth in the uninsured and underinsured population will \nmean additional costs for the city. \n                                                 \n263  About the Baltimore City Health Department, Baltimore City Health Department, \nhttps://health.baltimorecity.gov/about. \n264  Health Clinics & Services, Baltimore City Health Department, \nhttps://health.baltimorecity.gov/programs/health-clinics-services. \n265  Men’s Health Center, Baltimore City Health Department, \nhttps://health.baltimorecity.gov/health-clinics-services/mens-health-center. \n266  See, e.g., Family Planning & Reproductive Health Clinic, Baltimore City Health Department, \nhttps://health.baltimorecity.gov/health-clinics-services/family-planning-reproductive-health. \n107 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 112 of 134\n \n210.  The Baltimore City Health Department also provides or subsidizes a number of \nother services for Baltimore’s uninsured and underinsured residents. In particular, the \nDepartment funds a visiting-nurse program that makes house calls for individuals who tend to \nuse ambulance services frequently, including those with chronic health conditions like diabetes, \nhypertension, asthma, and mental health disorders. The Department also funds a number of other \nprograms focused on specific health conditions, including a Community Asthma Program, a \nTuberculosis Control Program, a Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program, and programs \nfor substance abuse.267 And the Department subsidizes a number of other entities that provide \nservices to Baltimore residents, including the Baltimore Family League and Health Care Access \nMaryland. An increase in the uninsured rate will similarly impose additional burdens on each of \nthese programs, and therefore require more funding from the city. \n211.  Like Columbus, the Baltimore City Fire Department also maintains an ambulance \nsystem that answers calls whether or not they come from individuals with health insurance or \nwho are otherwise able to pay.268 In 2017, the Baltimore City Fire Department answered over \n100,000 emergency medic calls (with 17,000 from uninsured residents) and had a budget of over \n$42 million for emergency medical services. \n212.  The Baltimore City Fire Department attempts to recoup its costs for ambulance \nservices by seeking reimbursement from a patient’s Medicare, Medicaid, or commercial health \n                                                 \n267  See, e.g., Asthma, Baltimore City Health Department, \nhttps://health.baltimorecity.gov/node/454; Health Clinics & Services, Baltimore City Health \nDepartment, https://health.baltimorecity.gov/programs/health-clinics-services; Lead Poisoning, \nBaltimore City Health Department, https://health.baltimorecity.gov/lead/lead-poisoning; \nSubstance Use and Misuse, Baltimore City Health Department, \nhttps://health.baltimorecity.gov/programs/substance-abuse; Tuberculosis, Baltimore City Health \nDepartment, https://health.baltimorecity.gov/node/164. \n268  See Welcome to the Baltimore City Fire Department, Baltimore City Fire Department, \nhttps://fire.baltimorecity.gov/. \n108 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 113 of 134\n \ninsurance coverage. If a patient lacks insurance, the department will seek reimbursement from \nthe patient personally, making several attempts to collect on the debt. However, the Department \nis rarely successful; while, on average, the department recoups 90 percent or more of its costs for \nambulance calls from individuals with private insurance, it only recoups less than 7 percent of its \ncosts for uninsured individuals. Thus, as with Columbus, more uninsured and underinsured \nindividuals means more ambulance calls for which Baltimore does not receive reimbursement \nand thus must make up for the shortfall in its budget. See supra ¶ 189.  \n213.  Indeed, Baltimore’s ambulance system will be hit especially hard; in its recent \nstrategic plan, the Baltimore City Fire Department identified “[r]esources allocation for EMS: \nallotment of resources with increasing EMS call volume; staffing; too many calls for amount of \npersonnel we have; potential closings” as the community’s chief area of concern.269 Baltimore \nhas adopted multiple programs to try to deal with this problem, including the visiting nurse \nprogram described above, and a High Utilizer Task Force “focused on strategies to support the \nmost vulnerable patients, whose unmet social, complex medical, behavioral health, or \nenvironmental needs contribute to repetitive, avoidable use of acute health services.”270 An \nincrease in the uninsured rate will only further strain a system which is already overstretched. \n214.  Finally, Baltimore—a city of over 600,000 people, with a $187.4 billion \neconomy—is similarly harmed by the burdens imposed by a sicker population. As with \nColumbus, an increase in the uninsured rate will drain Baltimore’s budget and resources across \nthe board, and will make the city a less attractive place to live and work.  \n                                                 \n269  Strategic Plan 2016-2021 at 9, Baltimore City Fire Department (2016), \nhttp://fire.baltimorecity.gov/sites/default/files/Baltimore%20Strategic%20Plan%202016-\n2021%20FINAL%2016%2010%2016%20corrected.pdf. \n270  High Utilizer Task Force, Baltimore City Health Department, \nhttps://health.baltimorecity.gov/high-utilizer-task-force. \n109 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 114 of 134\n \n215.  These harms, again, can be traced directly to Defendants’ unlawful actions. \nDefendants’ actions are contributing to stark premium increases in Maryland. The two insurers \non the state’s ACA exchange “requested average rate increases for 2019 that ranged from 18.5 \npercent to 91.4 percent, depending on the type of plan.”271 Maryland has been cleared by state \nlegislators to petition CMS to “establish a reinsurance program that would create a pot of money \nfor insurers to cover the most expensive claims,” but a health economist “said he would be \nshocked if the Trump [A]dministration approved such a request, given its efforts to weaken \nObamacare”: “It just seems very unlikely to me that Trump would approve this . . . . Maryland is \neasily saying we want to help prop up Obamacare, which the Trump administration doesn’t want \nto have anything to do with.”272 \n216.  Beyond 2019, one study describes Maryland as having a “high risk” of \nexperiencing premium increases of up to 50 percent.273 Another predicts premium increases \naveraging 30 percent.274 \n217.

The City of Cincinnati will, like Columbus and Baltimore, be harmed by having \nto pay more to support clinics that serve the uninsured and underinsured population, to maintain \nambulance services that respond to calls from uninsured residents, and to manage an increasingly \nless healthy and less productive population.  \n219.  “Since 1826, the Cincinnati Health Department . . . has been committed to \nprotecting and improving the health of the people of Cincinnati.” The Department is “a \nnationally recognized leader in public health” that “advocates for responsive health and human \nservices that promote healthy living environments and social well-being, as well as works to \nreduce health inequities such as poverty and unemployment.”278 The Department has an annual \nbudget of approximately $51 million and is staffed by 490 employees. \n220.  The Cincinnati Health Department subsidizes a number of health centers that will, \nagain, face greater demand as the rate of uninsured and underinsured individuals increases. \nThese centers have an annual budget of $23 million. In 2017, these centers saw about 45,000 \n                                                 \n276  March 2018 Urban Institute Study, supra n.116, at 10. \n277  See Selected Characteristics of Health Insurance Coverage in the United States, U.S. Census \nBureau (2016), \nhttps://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk (select \ntable and enter “Maryland” and “Baltimore city, Maryland”). \n278  About the Health Department, City of Cincinnati, https://www.cincinnati-\noh.gov/health/about-the-health-department/. \n111 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 116 of 134\n \npatients, with 95,000 individual visits. Specifically, these centers saw 13,123 uninsured \npatients—an 11 percent increase over the 2016 figure of 11,776 patients. \n221.  Most importantly, the Cincinnati Health Department operates seven freestanding \nprimary-care centers, which provide a full range of general medical services to Cincinnati’s \nuninsured residents. Cincinnati also operates nine dental centers, including one combined vision \nand dental center. The Department’s centers operate on a sliding-fee scale basis, where uninsured \nresidents pay based on their income. Thus, an increase in the uninsured and underinsured rate \nwill mean that Cincinnati must pay more to provide care to its residents. \n222.  Aside from its free-standing health clinics, the Cincinnati Health Department \noperates thirteen School Based Health Centers, serving 10,000 students, out of Cincinnati public \nschools, which provide “physicals, asthma management, immunizations, prescription \nmedications, sick and injury care, and health education to children and families.”279 These \ncenters are available to uninsured students, and will likewise see greater demand if those students \nand their families lack health insurance coverage. \n223.  The Cincinnati Health Department also operates several other programs designed \nto improve the health of city residents. For example, the Department operates a First Steps \nProgram that provides services, including home visits, to new mothers and their infant \nchildren;280 a Men’s Health Initiative that “specializes in providing health education and linking \nservices to men who have been historically underserved”;281 and a Community Health Nursing \n                                                 \n279  School & Adolescent Health, City of Cincinnati, https://www.cincinnati-\noh.gov/health/cincinnati-health-department-divisions1/school-adolescent-health/. \n280  Maternal and Infant Health, City of Cincinnati, https://www.cincinnati-\noh.gov/health/cincinnati-health-department-divisions1/fetal-infant-mortality/. \n281  Men’s Health, City of Cincinnati, https://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/health/cincinnati-health-\ndepartment-divisions1/men-s-health1/. \n \n112 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 117 of 134\n \nProgram that provides “comprehensive nursing services” on a sliding-scale basis because “when \ncoverage stops, we don’t.”282 Each of these services, too, will cost more to run as the rate of the \nuninsured and underinsured goes up. \n224.  Cincinnati also maintains an emergency medical services system, operated by the \nCincinnati Fire Department.283 That system dispatches ambulances to meet urgent health needs, \nregardless of whether the call comes from an individual who has health insurance or is otherwise \nable to pay for the call. In 2017, the Cincinnati Fire Department had a budget of over $60 \nmillion, and answered over 62,000 emergency medic calls. Around 34,000 of those calls resulted \nin hospital transports, and around 4,300 of those transports involved uninsured patients. Each of \nthese numbers increased from 2016 to 2017, and all else being equal will continue to increase in \n2018 because of the Trump Administration’s actions. \n225.  If a transported patient lacks insurance, Cincinnati will attempt to recoup its costs \nfrom the patient directly. However, while Cincinnati recoups between 93 percent and 94 percent \nof its billed costs from private insurers (based on rates negotiated by the city), it recoups less \nthan 3 percent of its costs from uninsured individuals. Thus, as explained above, an increase in \nthe number of uninsured or underinsured individuals will result in more transports for which \nCincinnati receives little reimbursement and thus must make up for the shortfall in its budget. \nSee supra ¶ 189.  \n226.  Setting aside these budgetary impacts, Cincinnati—a city of around 300,000 \npeople, with an economy of $132 billion—is harmed by the need to care for an increasingly \n                                                 \n282  Nursing Services, City of Cincinnati, https://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/health/cincinnati-health-\ndepartment-divisions1/nursing-services/. \n283  EMS Operations, City of Cincinnati, https://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/fire/operations/ems-\noperations/. \n113 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 118 of 134\n \nuninsured and less healthy population. As explained above, an increase in the rate of uninsured \nand underinsured individuals will impose additional drains on Cincinnati’s budget and its \npersonnel, and will make the city a less attractive place to live and work. \n227.  Cincinnati’s harms, too, are traceable to Defendants’ unlawful actions—as \nexplained above, those actions increase the rate of the uninsured and underinsured, which in turn \naffects Cincinnati’s budget and diminishes Cincinnati’s economic prospects. As explained above, \nDefendants’ actions are causing the uninsured rate in Ohio to rise. See supra ¶ 206. Like \nColumbus, Cincinnati has a higher uninsured rate than Ohio overall, and is likewise particularly \nvulnerable to Defendants’ attempts to sabotage the ACA.284 Accordingly, each of these harms \nwill also be redressed by countermanding the challenged provisions of the 2019 Rule specifically \nand Defendants’ sabotage of the ACA more generally. \n  Chicago, Illinois \n228.  Much like Columbus, Baltimore, and Cincinnati, the City of Chicago, too, will be \nharmed by the rise in the uninsured and underinsured rate caused by Defendants’ unlawful \nactions, including by being forced to pay more to operate and subsidize the clinics that serve its \nuninsured and underinsured residents, to fund its ambulance system in the face of greater \nunrecouped costs from calls by uninsured and underinsured individuals, and to manage the \ndownstream costs of a population that is necessarily sicker and less productive. \n                                                 \n284  See Community Health Assessment 33, City of Cincinnati, https://www.cincinnati-\noh.gov/health/assets/File/EDIT%20THIS%20CHA_12_21_17%20FINAL.pdf (last updated Dec. \n21, 2017); Selected Characteristics of Health Insurance Coverage in the United States, U.S. \nCensus Bureau (2016), \nhttps://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk (select \ntable and enter “Ohio” and “Cincinnati city, Ohio”). \n \n114 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 119 of 134\n \n229.  Chicago has a Department of Public Health that seeks to promote and improve the \nhealth of city residents. The Department has an annual budget of about $159 million and is \nstaffed by more than 600 full-time employees.285 \n230.  The Chicago Department of Public Health operates free or reduced-cost clinics \nthat, as described above, will face greater demand from uninsured or underinsured individuals \nwho cannot obtain health care elsewhere. Specifically, the Department operates five clinics that \nprovide free vaccinations;286 five clinics that provide mental-health services at no cost for \nuninsured Chicago residents;287 and three clinics that provide free testing and treatment for \nsexually transmitted infections.288 Collectively, these clinics serve thousands of uninsured city \nresidents. \n231.  The Chicago Department of Public Health also partners with community-based \nhealth centers to offer a wide array of medical services, including for uninsured patients. These \nhealth centers operate six clinics that provide primary care as well as care directed to the needs \n                                                 \n285  2018 Budget Overview 122, City of Chicago,  \nhttps://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/obm/supp_info/2018Budget/2018_Budget\n_Overview.pdf [hereinafter 2018 Budget Chicago Overview].  \n286  Walk-In Immunization Clinics, City of Chicago, \nhttps://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdph/supp_info/health-\nprotection/immunizations_walk-inclinics.html. \n287  Mental Health Centers, City of Chicago, \nhttps://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdph/supp_info/behavioral-\nhealth/mental_health_centers.html. \n288  STI/HIV Testing and STI Treatment, City of Chicago, \nhttps://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdph/provdrs/health_services/svcs/get_yourself_eva\nluatedforstihivaids.html. \n \n115 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 120 of 134\n \nof women and children and two primary-care clinics for people living with HIV/AIDS.289 \nChicago provides funding for these clinics as well.290 \n232.  If the rate of uninsured or underinsured individuals increases, then the clinics \noperated by the Chicago Department of Public Health and its community-based partners will \nnecessarily have to provide free or reduced-cost care to more patients. In that event, Chicago \neither must provide the Department and its partners with more funding, or the Department and its \npartners must decrease the services that they provide. \n233.  The Chicago Fire Department also provides ambulance transportation services to \nits residents, including its uninsured and underinsured residents. The Department receives about \n$88 million in annual funding for emergency medical services, employing nearly 800 people to \nprovide those services.291 The Department’s paramedics provide ambulance-transportation \nservices approximately 250,000 times per year. \n234.  The Chicago Fire Department provides ambulance services regardless of the \npatient’s income or insurance status. Chicago generally seeks reimbursement for ambulance \nservices from the patient or, if applicable, the patient’s insurer.292 But Chicago usually does not \nreceive full reimbursement for ambulance services from its uninsured residents. In 2017, for \nexample, the Chicago Fire Department provided ambulance services to 53,326 patients for whom \n                                                 \n289  Health Services, City of Chicago, \nhttps://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdph/provdrs/health_services.html. \n290  Neighborhood Health Clinic Information 2012, City of Chicago, \nhttps://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdph/supp_info/clinical_health/neighborhood_healt\nhclinicinformation2012.html. \n291  2018 Chicago Budget Overview, supra n.285, at 119. \n292  Ambulance Bills, City of Chicago, \nhttps://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/fin/supp_info/revenue/ambulance_bills.html. \n116 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 121 of 134\n \nno insurance was identified. Chicago charged these patients $55,242,627 for ambulance services \nbut collected just $1,755,545—a loss of $53,487,082. \n235.  As explained above, an increase in the number of uninsured or underinsured \nindividuals will result in more ambulance transports for which Chicago does not receive \nreimbursement and thus must make up for the shortfall in its budget. \n236.  Aside from these budgetary impacts, Chicago—a city of some 2.7 million people \nwith a gross regional product exceeding $600 billion—is, unsurprisingly, harmed by the need to \ncare for a population that is increasingly uninsured and less healthy. As explained above, an \nincrease in the rate of uninsured and underinsured individuals will impose additional drains on \nthe city’s budget and its personnel and will make the city a less attractive place to live and work. \n237.  Each of these harms is traceable to Defendants’ unlawful actions. As explained \nabove, Defendants’ actions increase the rate of the uninsured and underinsured, which in turn \naffects Chicago’s budget and diminishes Chicago’s economic prospects. Indeed, the Urban \nInstitute projects that Defendants’ sabotage efforts, among other factors, will cause enrollment in \nACA-compliant plans to decrease in Illinois by 25 percent for 2019—39.1 percent if expanded \naccess to short-term policies is factored in293—thus increasing the rate of the uninsured and the \nunderinsured. Another study estimates that Illinois has a “high risk” of a potential 50 percent \npremium increase.294 Moreover, Chicago tends to have a higher rate of uninsured individuals \nthan Illinois overall, leaving Chicago particularly exposed to Defendants’ sabotage efforts.295 \n                                                 \n293 March 2018 Urban Institute Study, supra n.116, at 10. \n294 March 2018 Covered California Study, supra n.155. \n295  See Selected Characteristics of Health Insurance Coverage in the United States, U.S. Census \nBureau (2016), \nhttps://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk (select \ntable and enter “Illinois” and “Chicago city, Illinois”). \n117 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 122 of 134\n \nOnce again, each of these harms will be redressed by enjoining the challenged provisions of the \n2019 Rule and Defendants’ efforts to sabotage the ACA. \nIII.  Defendants’ Unlawful Actions Harm the Individual Plaintiffs by Making Insurance \nCoverage Harder and More Expensive to Procure \n238.  Defendants’ unlawful actions have also harmed individuals and families, by \nmaking it harder and more expensive for them to purchase health insurance on the individual \nmarket. As explained above, Defendants’ conduct has caused premiums and deductibles to \nskyrocket nationwide, and will only drive them higher still.  \n239.  Every additional dollar that, owing to Defendants’ actions, an individual must \nspend to acquire health insurance constitutes financial harm. There can be no dispute that the \nrising cost of health insurance is a problem Congress specifically set out to address in enacting \nthe ACA. Congress specifically noted its desire to “significantly reduc[e] the number of the \nuninsured,” and thereby “lower health insurance premiums.” 42 U.S.C. § 18091(2)(F). In other \nwords, the ACA expressly “seeks to make insurance more affordable” for individuals and \nfamilies. King, 135 S. Ct. at 2487. \n240.  Since President Trump took office, however, premiums for health insurance \npurchased on the individual market have sharply increased. In the spring of 2017, insurers \nplanned for single-digit premium increases; by the fall, insurers had begun announcing hikes of \n40 percent or higher. Many experts agree that “[i]f the White House had made a good-faith effort \nto implement Obamacare . . . premiums on the marketplaces likely would have increased by \nsingle digits on average.”296 Similarly, “[i]nsurers in several states have requested large rate \n                                                 \n296  Dylan Scott, Obamacare Premiums Were Stabilizing.

Perhaps nowhere has the rising cost of health insurance been felt more than in \nCharlottesville, Virginia. For the 2018 benefit year, “[m]onthly health-care insurance premiums \nincreased all over America . . . but nowhere as dramatically as in Charlottesville,” according to \nthe Kaiser Family Foundation.298 “An exodus of carriers, which was blamed on losses caused by \nthe instability of the Obamacare marketplace,” and in turn directly attributable to the Trump \nAdministration’s actions, “created a coverage vacuum, leaving locals and insurance regulators \nscrambling.”299 As a result, monthly premiums for individuals and families tripled for 2018—\nbecoming the highest in the nation.300 \n242.  Specifically, Optima Health, then the area’s only individual market insurer, \noffered plans with premiums around $2,500 to $3,000 a month for a family of four, with an \nannual deductible of around $10,000 to $15,000—meaning that a family would have to pay \nnearly $50,000 before it saw any benefit from its health insurance.301 Rising premiums and \n                                                 \n297  Tami Luhby, Trump Moves Pushing Up Obamacare Premiums for 2019, CNN, June 7, 2018, \nhttps://www.cnn.com/2018/06/07/politics/obamacare-premiums/index.html. \n298  Colby Itkowitz, Where Are the Most Expensive ACA Plans in America?

Insurers have again sought to increase their rates in Virginia for 2019 by around \n20 percent.303 While Optima sought to slightly decrease its rates, that reduction does not come \nclose to canceling out the impact of its staggering rate increases in the past.304 Moreover, \nOptima’s (and other insurers’) rates would likely be lower still, if not for Defendants’ attempts to \nsabotage the ACA. \n244.  For all the reasons described above, Defendants’ actions have caused these \nstaggering increases in the cost of health insurance, in Virginia and nationwide. The Virginia \nBureau of Insurance reports that insurers are raising rates “due to the rising cost of health care \nbut also federal actions or inaction that raise costs and create uncertainty in the insurance \nmarkets.”305 Multiple independent studies have also connected rising health care premiums to \nDefendants’ sabotage efforts. The Urban Institute, for example, attributes a potential 19.1 percent \n                                                 \n302  Colby Itkowitz, Where Are the Most Expensive ACA Plans in America?

Optima has also placed the blame on Defendants, justifying its 2018 rate increases \nby pointing to “marketplace changes,” including “the uncertainty in Washington, and other \ncarriers withdrawing from the market or reducing their service area.”309 Specifically, Optima’s \n2018 rate filing attributed the increases to “growing uncertainty in the marketplace, particularly \nwith respect to various aspects of the Affordable Care Act . . . that continue to remain undecided \nand unstable,” including “the effectiveness / enforceability of the individual mandate, stability of \navailable plan options in the marketplace (e.g., carriers exiting the market), unknown funding of \nthe CSR subsidies, and preliminary rate filings indicating substantial rate actions for 2018 across \nvarious marketplaces, including Virginia.”310 Optima’s then-CEO and President, Michael \n                                                 \n306  March 2018 Urban Institute Study, supra n.116, at 16. \n307  KFF Tracking 2019 Premium Changes, supra n.216; see also John Tozzi, Obamacare \nPremiums to Surge Next Year, Early Requests Show, Bloomberg, May 7, 2018, \nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-07/obamacare-premiums-to-surge-next-year-\nearly-rate-requests-show.  \n308  March 2018 Covered California Post, supra n.216. \n309  2018 Individual & Family Plan Information, Optima Health, \nhttps://www.optimahealth.com/plans/individual/2018-plan-coverage-information. \n310  Part III Actuarial Memorandum, Optima Health Plan Individual Rate Filing 6, 28-29 \nMilliman (Sept. 15, 2017), \nhttp://ratereview.healthcare.gov/files/1023591_2018_I_OHP_PartIII_Act_Memo_20170915.pdf. \n \n121 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 126 of 134\n \nDudley, confirmed that “Optima is affected by the same factors destabilizing insurance markets \nelsewhere.”311  \n246.  Other regional insurers, like CareFirst Blue Cross Blue Shield and Evergreen \nHealth, have stated that Defendants are partly responsible for these substantial premium hikes.312 \nAnd still others, like Anthem, have cited Defendants’ sabotage efforts in defending their decision \nto exit the Virginia market, thus limiting choice and driving up prices for individual \nconsumers.313 These are not isolated cases: a study of insurer decisionmaking by the Urban \nInstitute found that most insurers “remain committed to participating in the individual market,” \nbut that their “commitment has been tested by the continued erosion of policies designed to \nmaintain the stability of the individual market.”314 \n247.  Steve Vondra and Bonnie Morgan, a married couple who have been residents of \nCharlottesville since 2009 and 2010, respectively, have therefore been forced to pay higher \npremiums for lower-quality insurance because of Defendants’ actions. \n                                                 \n311  Robert Pear, Middle-Class Families Confront Soaring Health Insurance Costs, New York \nTimes, Nov. 16, 2017, https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/us/politics/obamacare-premiums-\nmiddle-class.html?_r=0.. \n312  Sarah Kliff, The Trump Administration Is Making Obamacare More Expensive, Vox, May 8, \n2017, https://www.vox.com/2017/5/8/15563448/trump-insurance-premiums-2018. \n313  Michael Martz, Anthem, State’s Largest Health Insurer, Drops Out of Virginia’s Individual \nMarket for 2018, Richmond Times-Dispatch, Aug. 11, 2017, \nhttps://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/anthem-state-s-largest-health-\ninsurer-drops-out-of-virginia/article_c704aecb-f84d-5602-92ce-a04b711edb30.html; Katie \nO’Connor, 58 Virginia Counties Left Without an Insurance Option in 2018 Exchanges as \nDeadline Approaches, Richmond Times-Dispatch, Sept. 13, 2017, \nhttps://www.richmond.com/life/health/virginia-counties-left-without-an-insurance-option-in-\nexchanges-as/article_2e83056f-3d2e-5a04-9967-32bcbc93ea71.html. \n314  Sabrina Corlette et al., Insurers Remaining in Affordable Care Act Markets Prepare for \nContinued Uncertainty in 2018, 2019 at 3, Urban Institute (Mar. 2018), \nhttps://www.rwjf.org/content/dam/farm/reports/issue_briefs/2018/rwjf444308. \n122 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 127 of 134\n \n248.  Steve has a preexisting condition. Before the ACA, Steve’s health insurance \nsituation was precarious: he had not had health insurance since 2005, when he closed his \nbusiness. He was unable to purchase insurance because, at the time, insurers were able to \ndiscriminate against individuals on the basis of their health history and health status. While \nBonnie had insurance through her work, Steve was ineligible, as the two were not married at the \ntime. \n249.  After the ACA prohibited discrimination on the basis of preexisting conditions, \nSteve and Bonnie were finally able to purchase insurance on the individual exchange. In 2016, \nthey purchased a bronze plan with a premium of around $1050 a month for the two of them. \nThey subsequently upgraded their coverage in 2017 to a silver plan with a premium of around \n$1270 a month. \n250.  Defendants’ attempts to sabotage the ACA, however, have dramatically increased \nthe prices Steve and Bonnie pay for coverage. Steve and Bonnie do not receive subsidized \ncoverage (advance premium tax credits) under the Act. In 2018, Steve and Bonnie returned to a \nbronze plan, sold by Optima. However, the monthly premium rose to a staggering $3327.65 for \nthe two of them—a 261 percent increase above what they paid for a silver plan in 2017. \nMoreover, the plan’s annual deductible, around $14,400, is also significantly higher than the \ndeductible for the plans they purchased in 2016 and 2017. Combining a year’s worth of \npremiums and the annual deductible, Steve and Bonnie would have to spend nearly $55,000 \nbefore receiving any benefit from their insurance. \n251.  Steve and Bonnie have been injured by having to pay higher premiums and \ndeductibles for their health coverage—the very injury the ACA was intended to prevent. That \ninjury is the direct result of Defendants’ ongoing attempts to sabotage the ACA, including the \n123 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 128 of 134\n \n2019 Rule and Defendants’ other unlawful actions. And Steve and Bonnie’s injury would be \nredressed if Defendants were instead required to implement the ACA lawfully and in good faith. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCount One (Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act) \n252.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each of the foregoing allegations as \nif fully set forth herein. \n253.  The 2019 Rule is “final agency action for which there is no other adequate \nremedy in a court” and is “subject to judicial review.” 5 U.S.C. § 704; see id. § 702. \n254.  Under the Administrative Procedure Act, a “reviewing court shall . . . hold \nunlawful and set aside agency action . . . found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” Id. § 706(2)(A). \n255.  As detailed above, Defendants HHS, Secretary Azar, CMS, and Administrator \nVerma have failed to provide adequate reasons, and failed to adequately respond to comments, \nfor many provisions of the 2019 Rule, such that they are “arbitrary” and “capricious.” Id. In \naddition, as also detailed above, many provisions of the 2019 Rule violate the Affordable Care \nAct, and therefore are “not in accordance with law.” Id. Accordingly, upon application by the \nspecified Plaintiffs, this Court must “hold unlawful and set aside” the following provisions of the \n2019 Rule: \na.  The provision depriving taxpayers of advance premium tax credits for \nfailing to reconcile credits for prior years on their tax returns without \ndirect notification of their ineligibility. See supra ¶¶ 50-54. (Columbus, \nBaltimore, Cincinnati, Chicago, Individual Plaintiffs) \nb.  The provision outsourcing plan review on FFEs to states. See supra ¶¶ 55-\n61. (Columbus, Cincinnati, Individual Plaintiffs) \n124 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 129 of 134\n \nc.  The provision allowing insurance agents, brokers, and insurers to select \ntheir own third-party auditors. See supra ¶¶ 62-66. (Columbus, Cincinnati, \nChicago, Individual Plaintiffs) \nd.  The provision discontinuing support for standardized option insurance \nplans. See supra ¶¶ 68-72. (Columbus, Cincinnati, Chicago, Individual \nPlaintiffs) \ne.  The provisions eliminating the requirements that exchanges have at least \ntwo Navigators, that one of those Navigators be a community non-profit, \nand that Navigators have a physical presence in the state. See supra ¶¶ 73-\n77. (Columbus, Baltimore, Cincinnati, Chicago, Individual Plaintiffs) \nf.  The provision eliminating requirements that Small Business Health \nOptions Program Health Insurance Exchanges maintain employee \neligibility, premium aggregation, and online enrollment functionality. See \nsupra ¶¶ 78-80. (Columbus, Cincinnati, Chicago) \ng.  The provision requiring consumers who attest to income between 100 \npercent and 400 percent of the federal poverty line to verify their income \nif available electronic data sources indicate their income to be below the \nfederal poverty line. See supra ¶¶ 81-84. (Columbus, Cincinnati, Chicago, \nIndividual Plaintiffs) \nh.  The provision allowing states to petition for a reduction in risk adjustment \ntransfer payments. See supra ¶¶ 86-93. (Columbus, Baltimore, Cincinnati, \nChicago, Individual Plaintiffs) \n125 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 130 of 134\n \ni.  The provisions exempting student health insurance plans from rate review \nand increasing the threshold for insurance rate increases subject to review \nto 15 percent. See supra ¶¶ 94-99. (Columbus, Baltimore, Cincinnati, \nChicago, Individual Plaintiffs) \nj.  The provision allowing insurers to claim a standard 0.8 percent of \npremium for quality improvement activities when calculating medical loss \nratio. See supra ¶¶ 100-05. (Columbus, Baltimore, Cincinnati, Chicago, \nIndividual Plaintiffs) \nCount Two (Violation of the Take Care Clause) \n256.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each of the foregoing allegations as \nif fully set forth herein. \n257.  Under the Take Care Clause of the U.S. Constitution, the President and his or her \nAdministration must “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” U.S. Const. art. II, § 3. \n258.  As detailed above, Defendants have violated the Take Care Clause by failing to \ntake care to faithfully execute the Affordable Care Act. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray that this Court: \n1.  declare that the provisions of the 2019 Rule identified in Count One are arbitrary, \ncapricious, or otherwise not in accordance with law under the Administrative Procedure Act; \n2.  vacate the provisions of the 2019 Rule identified in Count One under the \nAdministrative Procedure Act; \n3.  declare that Defendants are violating the Take Care Clause by not faithfully \nexecuting the Affordable Care Act; \n126 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 131 of 134\n \n4.  declare that Defendants are violating the Take Care Clause by taking executive \naction to: \na.  suppress the number of individuals and families obtaining health insurance \nthrough ACA exchanges; \nb.  increase premiums for health insurance in the ACA exchanges; \nc.  diminish the availability of comprehensive, reasonably-priced health \ninsurance for individuals and families with preexisting conditions; \nd.  discourage individuals and families from obtaining health insurance that \nprovides the coverage that Congress, in the ACA, determined is necessary \nto protect American families against the physical and economic \ndevastation that results from lesser insurance, with limits on coverage that \nleaves them unable to cover the costs of an accident or unexpected illness; \n5.  order Defendants to comply with their constitutional obligation to take care to \nfaithfully execute the ACA, including by acting to: \na.  expand, rather than suppress, the number of individuals and families \nobtaining health insurance through ACA exchanges; \nb.  reduce, rather than increase, premiums for health insurance in the ACA \nexchanges; \nc.  promote, rather than diminish, the availability of comprehensive, \nreasonably-priced health insurance for individuals and families with \npreexisting conditions; \nd.  encourage, rather than discourage, individuals and families to obtain \nhealth insurance that provides the coverage that Congress, in the ACA, \n127 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 132 of 134\n \ndetermined is necessary to protect American families against the physical \nand economic devastation that results from lesser insurance, with limits on \ncoverage that leaves them unable to cover the costs of an accident or \nunexpected illness; \n6.  enjoin Defendants from implementing Executive Order No. 13,765 so as to \nundermine, rather than faithfully execute, the ACA; \n7.  order Defendants to fully fund advertising under the ACA; \n8.  enjoin Defendants from producing and disseminating advertisements that aim to \nundermine the ACA; \n9.  order Defendants to fully fund Navigators under the ACA; \n10.  enjoin Defendants from incentivizing Navigators to advertise non-ACA compliant \nplans; \n11.  order Defendants to lengthen the open enrollment period; \n12.  order Defendants to resume participation in enrollment events and other outreach \nactivities under the ACA;  \n13.  order Defendants to faithfully enforce the individual mandate as prescribed in the \nACA (as amended); \n14.  order Defendants to process states’ waiver applications under the ACA so as to \nfaithfully implement the Act; \n15.  enjoin Defendants from implementing Executive Order No. 13,813 so as to \nundermine, rather than faithfully execute, the ACA; \n16.  award Plaintiffs their costs, attorneys’ fees, and other disbursements for this \naction; and  \n128 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 1   Filed 08/02/18   Page 133 of 134\n \n17.  grant any other relief this Court deems appropriate. \nDated: Aug. 2, 2018  Respectfully submitted, \n   \nCity of Columbus  Javier M.

\nPlaintiffs the City of Columbus, Ohio, the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, \nMaryland, the City of Cincinnati, Ohio, the City of Chicago, Illinois, the City of Philadelphia, \nPennsylvania, Stephen Vondra, and Bonnie Morgan hereby sue Defendants Donald J. Trump, in \nhis official capacity as President of the United States of America, Alex M. Azar, II, in his official \ncapacity as Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the United \nStates Department of Health and Human Services, Seema Verma, in her official capacity as \nAdministrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the Centers for Medicare \nand Medicaid Services, and allege as follows: \n1.  Having failed to persuade Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act, President \nTrump and his Administration are waging a relentless campaign to sabotage and, ultimately, to \nnullify the law. President Trump has repeatedly admitted as much: because Congress rejected his \ndemand to have “Obamacare repealed,” he has said, he decided “to go a different route” and \n“end[] Obamacare” through his own actions. To that end, President Trump and his \nAdministration are deliberately trying to make the Act fail. They are discouraging Americans \nfrom enrolling in comprehensive plans that protect against debilitating medical expenses. They \nare working to raise prices and reduce choices for Americans seeking insurance in the Act’s \nexchanges. And they are misappropriating funds Congress allocated to support the Act, instead \nusing those funds to attack it. The Trump Administration’s strategy: to deceptively shift the \nblame from their own actions to the Act itself. Their objective: to pressure Congress to repeal the \nAct or, if that fails, to achieve de facto repeal through executive action alone. The \nAdministration’s actions are unlawful. \n2.  The scope of this Amended Complaint is testament to the breadth and persistence \nof the Trump Administration’s efforts to undermine the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”). As \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 6 of 148\nPlaintiffs—individuals and cities representing around 6 million Americans—allege in detail \nbelow, the Administration has tried to prevent families from obtaining health insurance through \nthe ACA’s exchanges by, for example: \n  promoting insurance that does not comply with the ACA’s requirements, including \ninsurance that does not cover preexisting conditions; \n  slashing funding for outreach strategies that have been proven to encourage \nindividuals, and healthy individuals in particular, to sign up for coverage; \n  misusing federal funds for advertising campaigns aimed at smearing the ACA and its \nexchanges, and spinning false narratives about the efficacy and success of the Act; \n  providing individuals and families with less time to choose a plan that is appropriate \nfor them; and \n  imposing unnecessary and onerous documentation requirements, making enrollment \neven harder. \nIn addition, the Administration has worked to increase premiums for ACA-compliant insurance \nby, for example, shirking oversight of insurance rate increases and reducing rebates owed to \nconsumers when insurers underperform. Finally, the Administration has attempted to make \naffordable, high-quality health insurance unavailable by sowing uncertainty in insurance \nmarkets, causing insurers to raise rates or exit markets altogether. \n3.  President Trump and his Administration have been remarkably transparent about \ntheir intent and their approach. “If we don’t get it done” in Congress, President Trump has said, \n“we are going to watch Obamacare go down the tubes, and we’ll blame the Democrats . . . [a]nd \nat some point, they are going to come and say, ‘You’ve got to help us.’” “[W]e are getting rid of \nObamacare,” President Trump has boasted, “essentially, we have gotten rid of it,” “[i]t’s dead[,] \n[i]t’s essentially dead,” “there is no Obamacare, it’s dead.” Of course, as a matter of \nconstitutional law, the Affordable Care Act has not been repealed; as a matter of fact, it is not \ndead, and indeed it has proven more resilient than the Administration might have hoped. But the \n2 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 7 of 148\nAdministration’s death-by-a-thousand-cuts campaign to undermine the Act via executive action \nalone has taken a toll. \n4.  All Americans are, quite literally, paying the price. The Trump Administration’s \nactions are driving insurers out of ACA exchanges, raising premiums, and increasing the \npopulation of underinsured and uninsured individuals. Defendants’ actions are therefore \nimposing significant costs on families and governments nationwide, including Plaintiffs in this \ncase. Specifically, the Trump Administration’s actions force the cities of Columbus, Ohio, \nBaltimore, Maryland, Cincinnati, Ohio, Chicago, Illinois, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to \nspend more on uncompensated care for their residents. The Trump Administration’s actions \nforce Steve Vondra and Bonnie Morgan to pay more for the quality health insurance coverage \nthey need—insurance that, for example, covers Steve’s preexisting condition. That is the precise \nopposite of what Congress intended the ACA to achieve. Congress passed the ACA to make \ncomprehensive health insurance more affordable and to reduce the costs of uncompensated care. \nThe ACA was achieving those aims before the Trump Administration came to power. \n5.  The Trump Administration’s actions are also an affront to the rule of law: to our \nconstitutional system, under which Congress enacts laws and the President faithfully implements \nthem. The Administration’s actions raise questions that go to the heart of our structure of \ngovernment: whether the executive branch must “take care that the laws be faithfully executed,” \nU.S. Const. art. II, § 3, and whether the Constitution therefore prohibits the President and his \nappointees from wielding executive power to destroy a duly-enacted law. The Administration’s \nactions violate the Take Care Clause and the Administrative Procedure Act. They should be \ndeclared unlawful and set aside. \n3 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 8 of 148\nNATURE OF THE ACTION \n6.  In 2010, the 111th Congress passed, and President Barack Obama signed into law, \nthe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.1 In so doing, Congress and the President enacted \nthe ACA into law pursuant to the “single, finely wrought and exhaustively considered[] \nprocedure” set forth in the Constitution. INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 951 (1983) (citing U.S. \nConst. art. I, §§ 1, 7). Under the Constitution, the ACA remains law unless Congress and the \nPresident revise or repeal it by that same procedure. Until then, President Trump and his \nAdministration must “take care that the law[] be faithfully executed.” U.S. Const. art. II, § 3. \n7.  Defendants have not only neglected this obligation: they have defied it. Having \ncampaigned on a promise to secure the ACA’s repeal but having failed to convince Congress to \ntake that step, President Trump has turned to executive action alone to try to sabotage the law. \nWhereas the ACA is “designed to expand coverage in the individual health insurance market,” \nKing v. Burwell, 135 S. Ct. 2480, 2485 (2015) (emphasis added), Defendants—by regulation, \nexecutive order, and otherwise—are obstructing individuals’ access to that market, purposefully \nattempting to destabilize it, laboring to increase insurance premiums and decrease enrollment, \nand using resources that Congress has provided to support the law in their blatant attempts to \nundermine it. \n8.  The executive actions challenged here have been undertaken to thwart the ACA’s \ngoals and try to make the law fail. They are therefore “incompatible with the expressed . . . will \nof Congress,” such that the Executive’s “power is at its lowest ebb” and judicial scrutiny is at its \n                                                 \n1   See Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. No. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119 (2010), \nas amended, Health Care Reconciliation Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-152, 124 Stat. 1029 \n(2010). The Affordable Care Act is also known as “Obamacare.” \n \n4 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 9 of 148\nmost strict, “for what is at stake is the equilibrium established by our constitutional system.” \nYoungstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 637-38 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring). \nPresident Trump may well believe, as he has repeatedly stated, that “[t]he best thing politically is \nto let [the ACA] explode.”2 But in acting on that intention—by neglecting to faithfully \nimplement the ACA and affirmatively taking numerous executive actions to sabotage it—\nPresident Trump and his Administration have violated the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 \nU.S.C. § 706, and the Take Care Clause, U.S. Const. art. II, § 3. \n9.  At issue here are a final rule and a long list, ever-growing, of other executive \nactions, all undertaken by the Trump Administration to undermine the ACA. \n10.  The final rule is the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Service’s Notice of Benefit \nand Payment Parameters for 2019, 83 Fed. Reg. 16,930 (April 17, 2018), referenced here as the \n“2019 Rule” as it governs many aspects of ACA insurance markets starting in the 2019 plan \nyear. The 2019 Rule implements a number of changes, detailed below, that increase the cost of \nhealth coverage and impose other barriers to enrollment. These changes lack adequate \njustification and, in some instances, violate the Affordable Care Act’s text; they are therefore \n“arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A), and must be “[held] unlawful and set aside,” id. § 706(2). \n11.  The 2019 Rule’s unlawful changes are also evidence of Defendants’ failure to \ncomply with their duty under the Constitution to “take care that the [Affordable Care Act] be \nfaithfully executed.” U.S. Const. art. II, § 3. \n                                                 \n2   Amy Goldstein & Juliet Eilperin, Affordable Care Act Remains ‘Law of the Land,’ but Trump \nVows to Explode It, Washington Post, Mar. 24, 2017, \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/affordable-care-act-remains-law-of-\nthe-land-but-trump-vows-to-explode-it/2017/03/24/4b7a2530-10c3-11e7-ab07-\n07d9f521f6b5_story.html. \n5 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 10 of 148\n12.  The 2019 Rule does not stand alone. A slew of executive actions, starting with the \nvery first executive order President Trump issued on the day of his inauguration and continuing \nthrough the present, further confirms Defendants’ failure to heed the obligations that the Take \nCare Clause imposes. Unquestionably, “[t]he Constitution does not confer upon [the President] \nany power to enact laws or to suspend or repeal such as the Congress enacts.” United States v. \nMidwest Oil Co., 236 U.S. 459, 505 (1915). Rather, “[u]nder our system of government, \nCongress makes laws and the President, acting at times through agencies . . . ‘faithfully \nexecute[s]’ them.” Util. Air Regulatory Grp. v. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 134 S. Ct. 2427, 2446 (2014) \n(quoting U.S. Const. art. II, § 3) (final alteration in original).3 That principle, embodied in the \nTake Care Clause, is as fundamental as it is longstanding. Just as courts “cannot interpret federal \nstatutes to negate their own stated purposes,” King, 135 S. Ct. at 2493, the President cannot \n“implement” a federal statute in ways designed to destroy it. This is precisely what President \nTrump and his Administration are doing. By actively and avowedly wielding executive authority \nto sabotage the ACA, Defendants are not acting in good faith; instead, they have usurped \nCongress’s lawmaking function, and they are violating the Constitution. \n13.  This Court must intervene. For the reasons set forth below, this Court should \ndeclare that Defendants have violated the Administrative Procedure Act and failed to fulfill their \nconstitutional duty to faithfully execute the Affordable Care Act, enjoin Defendants’ attempts to \n                                                 \n3   See Brief for the Cato Institute, Professor Randy E. Barnett, and Professor Jeremy Rabkin as \nAmici Curiae Supporting Respondents at 10, United States v. Texas, 136 S.

It is pitched at the highest \nregister of constitutional obligation. The president shall—not may. He shall take care—not \nmerely attempt.

This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331. Plaintiffs’ claim \nchallenging the 2019 Rule is reviewable under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \n§§ 702, 704, 706. As to Plaintiffs’ claim under the Take Care Clause, this Court has authority to \nissue “equitable relief . . . ‘[to] prevent[] entities from acting unconstitutionally.’” Free Enter. \nFund v. Pub.

The Individual Health Insurance Markets and the Affordable Care Act \n32.  Individual health insurance is insurance that individuals purchase themselves, in \ncontrast to, for example, joining employer-sponsored group health plans. Prior to the enactment \nof the ACA, individual health insurance markets were dysfunctional: \nOne reason was that premiums for these policies were increasing more than 10% \na year, on average, while the policies themselves had major deficiencies. They \noften excluded pre-existing conditions, charged higher premiums for people with \nhealth risks and for young women, placed limits on annual and lifetime benefits, \nor refused to renew policies for individuals who became sick. Many people who \ntried to buy plans were turned down. In 2010, an estimated 9 million adults who \nhad tried to buy a plan in the individual market over the prior three years reported \nthat they were turned down, charged a higher price, or had a condition excluded \nfrom their plan because of their health. Faced with unsubsidized premiums and \nflawed products, the majority of consumers who tried to buy a plan remained \nuninsured. Only healthy people could get policies, and only those with good \nincomes could afford the premiums.7 \n \n33.  As the Supreme Court has explained, many state efforts to reform the individual \nhealth insurance market in the 1990s were unsuccessful. King, 135 S. Ct. at 2485-86. The ACA \n“grew out of [this] long history of failed health insurance reform,” id. at 2485, and aims to \n                                                 \n7   David Blumenthal & Sara Collins, Where Both the ACA and AHCA Fall Short, and \nWhat the Health Insurance Market Really Needs, Harvard Business Review, Mar. 21, \n2017, https://hbr.org/2017/03/where-both-the-aca-and-ahca-fall-short-and-what-the-\nhealth-insurance-market-really-needs [hereinafter Blumenthal & Collins]. \n10 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 15 of 148\nachieve systemic improvements in the individual health insurance market by means of certain \nkey reforms, including: \na.  Nondiscrimination on the basis of health status and health history. The \nACA requires “each health insurance issuer that offers health insurance \ncoverage in the individual . . . market in a State [to] accept \nevery . . . individual in the State that applies for such coverage,” 42 U.S.C. \n§ 300gg-1(a), and bars insurers from charging higher premiums on the \nbasis of a person’s health, id. § 300gg. ACA-compliant health insurance \ntherefore covers preexisting conditions; it does not discriminate on the \nbasis of an individual’s health status and health history. See id. § 300gg-4. \nb.  Essential health benefits. Insurance for individuals and families sold on \nACA exchanges must cover “essential health benefits,” id. § 300gg-6(a), \nincluding hospitalization, prescription drugs, emergency services, \nambulatory patient services, maternity and newborn care, mental health \nand substance use disorder services, preventive and wellness services, and \npediatric services including oral and vision care, see id. § 18022(b)(1). In \naddition, to protect patients from being confronted with devastating costs \nwhen a medical condition exhausts their health coverage, the ACA limits \nso-called “cost-sharing”—for example, deductibles and copayments—for \nessential health benefits coverage, and prohibits plans from imposing \nannual or lifetime limits on such coverage. See id. §§ 300gg-\n6(b), 18022(a)(2), (c). \n11 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 16 of 148\nc.  Subsidized coverage. The ACA “seeks to make insurance more affordable \nby giving refundable tax credits to individuals with household incomes \nbetween 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty line.” King, \n135 S. Ct. at 2487 (citing 26 U.S.C. § 36B; 42 U.S.C. §§ 18081, 18082). \nFinancial assistance comes through income-related, premium-based tax \ncredits—known as advance premium tax credits, or “APTCs”—for \nqualified individuals. The Act also requires health insurance issuers to \nreduce certain individuals’ cost-sharing expenditures and directs HHS to \nreimburse issuers for such cost-sharing reductions (“CSRs”). See 18 \nU.S.C. § 18071. \n34.  In addition, as enacted, the ACA required individuals to maintain health insurance \ncoverage or make a shared responsibility payment to the Internal Revenue Service. 26 U.S.C. \n§ 5000A. As a result of congressional action in 2017, starting after December 31, 2018, the \nshared responsibility payment was reduced to $0.8 Although it was initially believed that the \nshared responsibility payment was essential for maintaining the stability of health insurance \nmarkets, experience from the ACA’s implementation has indicated that the elimination of the \npayment will increase premiums for unsubsidized enrollees by 10 percent for 2019 but will not \ndestabilize markets.9 \n                                                 \n8   Budget Fiscal Year, 2018, Pub.

To facilitate individuals’ ability to learn about and enroll in the health insurance \noptions that are available to them, the ACA “requires the creation of an ‘Exchange’ in each State \nwhere people can shop for insurance, usually online.” King, 135 S. Ct. at 2487 (quoting 42 \nU.S.C. § 18031(b)(1)). These exchanges, also known as health insurance marketplaces, enable \npeople not eligible for Medicare or Medicaid to obtain adequate, affordable private insurance \nindependent of their jobs. The exchanges remedy a problem that had long bedeviled individual \nhealth insurance markets: individuals’ inability to intelligently compare different plans in terms \nof price and quality. For ease of comparison, the ACA differentiates plans along four standard \nmetallic tiers—Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum, from least to most generous—according to \nhow they apportion costs between individuals and issuers. 42 U.S.C. § 18022(d).10 Thus, as the \nSupreme Court has summarized, an exchange in each state serves as “a marketplace that allows \npeople to compare and purchase” ACA-compliant insurance plans, King, 135 S. Ct. at 2485, \nknown as “qualified health plans” or “QHPs” under the Act, 42 U.S.C. § 18031(b)(1); see id. \n§ 18021(a). \n36.  Individuals may enroll in qualified health plans on an exchange during a specified \nannual open enrollment period or, if they qualify on the basis of certain life events—such as \ngetting married, having a baby, or losing other health coverage—they may enroll during a special \nenrollment period. Id. § 18031(c)(6).11 \n                                                 \n10   See Health Plan Categories, HealthCare.gov, https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/health-\nplan-categories/.  \n11   See Open Enrollment Period, HealthCare.gov, https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/open-\nenrollment-period/. The exchanges also offer small businesses a way to find qualified health \nplans on a platform called the Small Business Health Options Program or “SHOP.” See 42 \nU.S.C. § 18031(b)(1)(B). \n13 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 18 of 148\n37.  ACA exchanges also help consumers make smart health insurance choices by \nrunning call centers and providing in-person assistance. For example, the ACA requires that \nexchanges award grants to healthcare “Navigators” to “carry out . . . duties” that are specified by \nstatute, id. § 18031(i)(1); see id. § 18031(i)(3), and in HHS implementing regulations, see 45 \nC.F.R. §§ 155.210, 155.215. By law, Navigators’ essential responsibilities include maintaining a \ncurrent understanding of available health insurance options, conducting public education and \nawareness campaigns, helping consumers understand their choices, facilitating consumer health \ninsurance decisions, and ensuring access to consumer protections. \n38.  An exchange may be established by the state in which it operates or, in states that \nelect not to establish exchanges, by the federal government. See King, 135 S. Ct. at 2487 (citing \n42 U.S.C. §§ 18031(b)(1), 18041(c)(1)); 45 C.F.R. § 155.105(f)). As of 2018, twelve states \noperated their “state-based exchanges” or “SBEs” (operating their own websites rather than \nusing the federally-run HealthCare.gov), twenty-eight states relied entirely on the federal \ngovernment to run their “federally-facilitated exchanges” or “FFEs” using HealthCare.gov, and \neleven states had hybrid exchanges that assume some, but not all, exchange functions.12 As \nrelevant here, the exchanges in Ohio and Pennsylvania are FFEs, the exchange in Maryland is an \nSBE, and the exchange in Illinois is a hybrid exchange. \n39.  The ACA requires that exchanges offer only quality health insurance: insurance \nthat covers preexisting conditions, for example, and that does not impose annual or lifetime \n                                                 \n12   State Health Insurance Marketplace Types, 2018, Kaiser Family Foundation, \nhttps://www.kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/state-health-insurance-marketplace-types/; see \nHHS, Cooperative Agreement to Support Navigators in Federally-facilitated Exchanges: Notice \nof Funding Opportunity 89 (July 10, 2018), \nhttps://www.grantsolutions.gov/gs/preaward/previewPublicAnnouncement.do?id=62537 (click \n“View PDF”) (listing states that will have an FFE for plan year 2019). \n14 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 19 of 148\ndollar limits on core coverage. Such coverage has been found to improve access to care and \noverall health, and to reduce financial burdens for both individuals and institutions that cover the \ncosts of uncompensated care. But increasing enrollment in quality health insurance coverage is \nnot only the ACA’s immediate goal; it is also key to the Act’s long-term success. “Achieving \ninsurance market stability over time . . . requires robust enrollment.”13 Specifically, “[a]t the \noverall market level, enrollment must be high enough to reduce random fluctuations in claims \nfrom year to year.”14 In addition, “[b]ecause the ACA prohibits health plans from denying \ncoverage or charging higher premiums based on preexisting health conditions, having affordable \npremiums depends on enrolling enough healthy individuals over which the costs of the less-\nhealthy individuals can be spread. Enrollment of only individuals with high health care \nneeds . . . can produce unsustainable upward premium spirals.”15  \n40.  Limiting the cost of health insurance is, in turn, essential to promoting increased \nenrollment. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has found that “cost is the top \nreason cited” for individuals ending their coverage.16 To that end, the ACA and its implementing \nregulations aim to drive costs down specifically for coverage available on the exchanges, \nspurring further enrollment and ensuring that health insurance markets function smoothly. \n                                                 \n13   Blumenthal & Collins, supra n.7. \n14   American Academy of Actuaries, An Evaluation of the Individual Health Insurance Market \nand Implications of Potential Changes 5 (Jan. 2017), \nhttps://www.actuary.org/files/publications/Acad_eval_indiv_mkt_011817.pdf. \n15   Id. \n16   Press Release, CMS, High Costs, Lack of Affordability Most Common Factors that Lead \nConsumers to Cancel Health Insurance Coverage (June 12, 2017), \nhttps://www.cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/Press-releases/2017-Press-releases-\nitems/2017-06-12.html. \n \n15 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 20 of 148\n41.  When faithfully implemented, the ACA’s reforms successfully met Congress’s \ngoal of enabling more individuals—specifically, 20 million more individuals17—to enroll in \nhealth insurance coverage. Indeed, the number of uninsured nonelderly Americans had decreased \nfrom 44 million in 2013 (the year before the ACA’s major coverage provisions went into effect) \nto around 28 million by the end of 2016.18 The uninsured rate had dropped across all \ndemographic groups; individuals with low and moderate incomes, young people, and those who \nlive in rural areas have experienced particularly dramatic coverage gains.19 In addition, the \nCongressional Budget Office has concluded that under the ACA—assuming it is implemented \nfaithfully—the market for individual health insurance “would probably be stable in most \nareas.”20 \n                                                 \n17   Namrata Uberio et al., Health Insurance Coverage and the Affordable Care Act, 2010-2016 \nat 8, HHS (March 3, 2016), https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/pdf/187551/ACA2010-2016.pdf. \n18   See Key Facts About the Uninsured Population, Kaiser Family Foundation (Nov. 29, 2017), \nhttps://www.kff.org/uninsured/fact-sheet/key-facts-about-the-uninsured-population/ [hereinafter \nKFF Key Facts]; Robin A.

Several aspects of the ACA contributed to the 57 percent increase in the number \nof people covered in the individual market (on and off exchanges) between 2013 and 2016.21 \nOverall, an estimated 40 percent of the coverage gain attributable to the ACA resulted from the \nexchanges’ policies.22 In addition, the ACA set up the exchanges to encourage competition \namong insurers, both to keep premiums low and to improve customer service. To that end, it \nsignificantly standardized benefits and cost-sharing to facilitate shopping on price, required that \nthe exchanges create tools to allow consumers to compare plans, and established a permanent \nrisk-adjustment program to prevent insurers from profiting by disproportionately enrolling \npeople with lower-than-average health care costs.  \n43.  The results were clear: the unsubsidized cost of coverage in the exchanges, before \nthe start of the Trump Administration, was 10 percent lower than the average employer-\nsponsored insurance premium.23 In the early years after the exchanges opened, some insurers set \nprices so low that they lost money in order to gain market share; others did not fully understand \nthe risks of their new customers. In 2017, they raised premiums to correct those mistakes. After \nthe 2017 price corrections, expert analyses indicated that premiums would have grown in single \ndigits for 2018 but for Defendants’ policies, including those challenged here.24 \n                                                 \n21   Health Insurance Coverage of Nonelderly 0-64, 2013 and 2016, Kaiser Family Foundation, \nhttps://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/nonelderly-0-64/.  \n22   See Molly Frean et al., Premium Subsidies, the Mandate, and Medicaid Expansion: Coverage \nEffects of the Affordable Care Act, 53 J. of Health Economics 72 (2016), \nhttp://www.nber.org/papers/w22213.  \n23   Linda J.

The Administration’s Intent to Repeal the ACA, With or Without Congress \n44.  Notwithstanding the ACA’s demonstrated successes, President Trump has \nrepeatedly vowed to ensure that the Act is repealed. For example, on June 15, 2015, in \nannouncing his candidacy for the presidency, he stated, “So, just to sum up, I would do various \nthings very quickly. I would repeal and replace the big lie, Obamacare.”25 On October 8, 2015, \nthen-candidate Trump stated, “We’re gonna repeal Obamacare.”26 Then, on July 21, 2016, in \naccepting the Republican nomination for the presidency, Trump stated, “We will repeal and \nreplace disastrous Obamacare.”27  \n45.  Despite these promises by the President—and many, many more not catalogued \nhere—and despite repeated attempts, Congress has declined to pass a bill repealing the \nAffordable Care Act.  \n46.  President Trump has repeatedly admitted that three key elements of his strategy to \nconvince Congress to repeal the ACA are asserting—falsely—that the law is failing, \nundermining the ACA by neglect, and sabotaging the ACA with affirmative executive actions: \n                                                 \nindividual-health-insurance-market-through-2017/; Mark A.

On January 26, 2017, President Trump stated, “If we waited two years, \n[the ACA is] going to explode like you’ve never seen an explosion. \nNobody’s going to be able to afford it. It’s a disaster. And that’s politically \nwhat we should do . . . .”30 \nd.  On January 26, 2017, President Trump stated, “[The ACA] actually \nexplodes in ‘17. And I told the Republicans.

In that same vein, in a speech on July 23, 2018, according to an observer, \nPresident Trump stated that “Obamacare’s very rapidly fading away” and \nonce again singled out Sen. McCain.64 \no.  On August 1, 2018, President Trump returned to the same theme, stating: \nWe had Obamacare repealed and replaced, and a man—I won’t mention his name.

Statements disparaging the Affordable Care Act have also been made by other \nprominent members of President Trump’s Administration, including when announcing some of \nthe very executive actions at issue here. For example, in announcing that open enrollment for the \n2018 plan year would be cut in half from previous years, CMS’s press release touted, in bullet \nform, “[r]ecent statistics related to the Affordable Care Act” that were deliberately selected to \npaint a false picture of the Act as failing.69 On information and belief, CMS Administrator \nSeema Verma edited these bullets herself. And on a media call to explain the 2019 Rule, Ms. \nVerma said, “It’s clear that Obamacare continues to have negative effects on many \nAmericans.”70 That view—mistaken, and more importantly, contrary to Congress’s judgment—\npermeates and drives the Administration’s campaign to undermine the ACA. \n                                                 \n67   Speech: Donald Trump Holds a Political Rally in Huntington, West Virginia – November 2, \n2018, Factbase, https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-maga-rally-huntington-wv-\nnovember-2-2018.  \n68   @Acosta, Twitter (Nov. 2, 2018, 8:19 PM), \nhttps://twitter.com/acosta/status/1058514065595777024?s=21.  \n69   Press Release, CMS, CMS Issues Final Rule to Increase Choices and Encourage Stability in \nHealth Insurance Market for 2018 (Apr. 13, 2017), \nhttps://www.cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/Press-releases/2017-Press-releases-\nitems/2017-04-13-2.html.  \n70   Allison Inserro, CMS Creates New ACA Penalty Mandate Exemptions, Including Opposition \nto Abortion, AJMC, Apr. 10, 2018, https://www.ajmc.com/newsroom/cms-creates-new-aca-\npenalty-mandate-exemptions-including-opposition-to-abortion.  \n \n29 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 34 of 148\nDEFENDANTS’ EXECUTIVE ACTIONS  \nTO SABOTAGE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT \n49.  President Trump and his Administration have attempted to deliver on their \nrepeated promises to sabotage the Affordable Care Act. The Administration knows what \nexecutive actions would faithfully implement the Act and further the Act’s objective of \nexpanding affordable health insurance to every American.71 Yet the Administration has \nrepeatedly refused to pursue such actions and has instead adopted policies affirmatively designed \nto undermine the Act. As detailed below, multiple provisions of the 2019 Rule, and many other \nexecutive actions, have the aim and effect of weakening ACA exchanges, driving up premiums, \nand driving out issuers, ultimately increasing the rate of the uninsured and underinsured.  \nI.  The 2019 Rule \n50.  In April 2018, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services promulgated a \nfinal rule that undermines many of the Act’s safeguards and requirements. See Notice of Benefit \nand Payment Parameters for 2019, 83 Fed. Reg. 16,930 (April 17, 2018). Specifically, many \nprovisions of the 2019 Rule roll back protections that the Act guarantees, make it more difficult \nto enroll in ACA-compliant plans, and drive up the cost of ACA-compliant plans. For the \nreasons explained below, the enumerated provisions of the 2019 Rule violate the Administrative \nProcedure Act and must be set aside.  \n  Eliminating Protections that the ACA Guarantees \n51.  Numerous provisions of the 2019 Rule weaken or eliminate ACA protections \nnecessary to ensure that individuals have access to quality, affordable health insurance coverage. \n                                                 \n71   See, e.g., Letter from Andrew M. Slavitt to CMS Administrator Verma (Nov. 27, 2017), \navailable at https://www.regulations.gov/contentStreamer?documentId=CMS-2017-0141-\n0240&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf (commenting on the 2019 Rule as proposed). \n30 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 35 of 148\n1.  Permitting Exchanges to Strip Individuals of Eligibility for Tax Credits \nWithout Providing Direct Notification \n52.  As noted above, many individuals who purchase health insurance through the \nexchanges are eligible for premium subsidies known as advance premium tax credits. The \nAffordable Care Act required HHS to promulgate regulations further defining APTC eligibility. \n42 U.S.C. §§ 18081, 18082. Among other things, HHS regulations direct exchanges to deny \nAPTCs to an individual if the Internal Revenue Service notifies the exchange that the individual \nor a member of her household did not reconcile the amount of advance premium tax credits she \nreceived with the amount of the actual premium tax credit she should have been allowed on her \nprior year’s tax return. See 45 C.F.R. § 155.305(f)(4) (describing process for filing a federal \nincome tax return). This provision, known as the failure to reconcile provision, was amended in \n2016 to specify that an exchange may not deny APTC under this provision “unless direct \nnotification is first sent to the tax filer . . . that his or her eligibility will be discontinued as a \nresult of the tax filer’s failure to comply with the requirement.” 45 C.F.R. § 155.305(f)(4)(ii) \n(2016) (effective Jan. 17, 2017 to June 17, 2018). \n53.  The 2019 Rule continues to require that exchanges deny APTCs to individuals \nwho fail to reconcile APTCs received in a prior year on their tax return but, crucially, removes \nthe requirement that exchanges first provide such individuals with direct notification that their \neligibility will be discontinued as a result of their failure to comply with this requirement. 83 \nFed. Reg. at 16,982. The 2019 Rule’s failure to reconcile provision is contrary to law and \narbitrary and capricious, and therefore must be set aside. \n54.  The failure to reconcile provision conflicts with express statutory language \nrequiring that any eligible individual be allowed to claim APTC. Under 26 U.S.C. § 36B, “[i]n \nthe case of an applicable taxpayer, there shall be allowed as a credit against the tax \n31 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 36 of 148\nimposed . . . for any taxable year an amount equal to the premium assistance credit amount of the \ntaxpayer for the taxable year.” The statute’s plain terms thus require that any applicable taxpayer \nbe allowed to claim an APTC. The term “applicable taxpayer” means, “with respect to any \ntaxable year, a taxpayer whose household income for the taxable year equals or exceeds 100 \npercent but does not exceed 400 percent of an amount equal to the poverty line for a family of \nthe size involved.” 26 U.S.C. § 36B(c)(1)(A). Whether an individual has reconciled her APTC \nhas no bearing on whether she is an “applicable taxpayer” under the statute. Therefore, depriving \nan “applicable taxpayer” of the credit that the statute says “shall be allowed” based on a failure \nto reconcile his or her taxes violates the plain language of the statute. \n55.  In addition, CMS’s decision to remove the direct notification requirement is \narbitrary and capricious. CMS attempted to justify its decision to remove the direct notification \nrequirement by asserting that state exchanges are not equipped to send direct notices and in light \nof the agency’s belief that “ensuring consumers are not receiving APTC improperly is necessary \nfor program integrity.” 83 Fed. Reg. at 16,984. This purported justification fails, and the 2019 \nRule’s failure to reconcile provision is arbitrary and capricious, for at least two reasons. First, \nCMS offered no evidence that consumers are in fact “receiving APTC improperly.” Id. Second, \nthe 2019 Rule indicates that FFEs will continue to provide direct notification, demonstrating that \nCMS recognizes the utility and importance of such notifications. See id. at 16,983. Indeed, the \ndirect notice requirement was added to the failure to reconcile provision in 2016 in response to \nconcerns that denying APTCs without direct notice would violate due process.72 CMS thus \n                                                 \n72   HHS, Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters for 2018; Amendments to Special \nEnrollment Periods, 81 Fed. Reg. 94,058, 94,124 (Dec. 22, 2016). \n32 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 37 of 148\nknows about the problem that direct notification was designed to solve, and yet is now \neliminating the solution without setting forth any evidence that the problem has gone away.  \n56.  The 2019 Rule will cause eligible individuals to lose the subsidies that the ACA \nguarantees, and will do so without providing any advance, direct notification. In 2017, annual \npremium tax credits averaged $4,458.73 The unexpected loss of this assistance would likely cause \nmany if not most individuals to drop coverage entirely, especially since they will not know why \nthey lost it or how to remedy their loss. Individuals might lose subsidies for any number of \nreasons that would ultimately prove unfounded; direct notification facilitated individuals’ efforts \nto determine why they had lost eligibility and how to fix the problem. Former Administration \nofficials who worked to implement the ACA’s advance premium tax credit program estimate that \nthis Administration’s decision could deprive up to 800,000 eligible individuals of their APTCs, \nleading to a significant rise in the number of uninsured Americans—directly contrary to the \npurpose of the Act. \n2.  Outsourcing to States the Compliance Review of Insurance Plans to be \nOffered on Federal Exchanges \n57.  According to the text of the ACA, the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n“shall, by regulation, establish criteria for the certification of health plans as qualified health \nplans,” 42 U.S.C. § 18031(c)(1), including criteria that “ensure a sufficient choice of providers,” \nid. § 18031(c)(1)(B)—i.e., criteria that ensure network adequacy. Pursuant to those criteria, “[a]n \nExchange shall, at a minimum[,] implement procedures for the certification, recertification, and \ndecertification . . . of health plans as qualified health plans.” 42 U.S.C. § 18031(d)(4)(A). \n                                                 \n73  See CMS, 2017 Effectuated Enrollment Snapshot 5 (June 12, 2017), \nhttps://downloads.cms.gov/files/effectuated-enrollment-snapshot-report-06-12-17.pdf.  \n33 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 38 of 148\n58.  Consistent with these statutory requirements, CMS, acting as the exchange in \nstates with federally-facilitated exchanges, used to review network adequacy and accreditation \nstatus plans that insurers proposed to offer on those exchanges. \n59.  The 2019 Rule instead extends a policy first adopted in the 2018 Market \nStabilization Rule, 82 Fed. Reg. 18,346, 18,371-72 (April 18, 2017), under which CMS will \n“rely on the [s]tates’ reviews” of network adequacy and other critical requirements in certain \nfederally-facilitated exchanges, see 83 Fed. Reg. at 17,024-26. In defending its decision, CMS \nexplained that it “is committed to recognizing States’ role as the primary regulator of their \ninsurance markets,” and that it sought “to limit duplicative oversight over issuers.” Id. at 17,024. \nCMS’s decision is both contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious under the APA, and must be \nset aside. \n60.  First, CMS’s decision conflicts with express statutory language, quoted above, \nthat requires the federal government, as the administrator of federally-facilitated exchanges, to \ncertify plans proffered by insurers as qualified health plans under the applicable statutory and \nregulatory criteria. Under the ACA, the Secretary of Health and Human Services “shall, by \nregulation, establish criteria for the certification of health plans as qualified health plans,” \nincluding criteria that “ensure a sufficient choice of providers.” 42 U.S.C. § 18031(c)(1) \n(emphasis added). Pursuant to those criteria, “[a]n Exchange shall, at a minimum[,] implement \nprocedures for the certification, recertification, and decertification . . . of health plans as qualified \nhealth plans.” 42 U.S.C. § 18031(d)(4)(A) (emphasis added). The statute’s repeated use of the \nterm “shall” makes plain that these are mandatory duties. Moreover, the statutory requirement to \ncertify health plans is a “minimum” requirement, 42 U.S.C. § 18031(d)(4)(A), below which an \n34 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 39 of 148\nexchange cannot fall. Simply deferring to states to conduct plan reviews does not constitute \n“implement[ing] procedures” for the exchange’s review. \n61.  Interpreting the statute to prohibit CMS’s decision to rubber-stamp states’ review \nof network adequacy for federally-facilitated exchanges is also consistent with the Act’s purpose. \nAmong other things, “[t]he Act aims to increase the number of Americans covered by health \ninsurance” adequate to meet their health needs. Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. \n519, 538 (2012). But health insurance cannot meet a consumer’s needs if the provider’s network \nis inadequate—that is, if it lacks facilities close to the consumer’s home or that are equipped to \nhandle the consumer’s specific medical conditions. Thus, permitting CMS, as the administrator \nof federally-facilitated exchanges, to approve a state’s assessment of network adequacy \npowerfully undermines this central feature of, and conflicts with, the ACA. \n62.  Second, even if the ACA permitted the choice CMS made, the explanation CMS \noffered for outsourcing its duties to states is insufficient, confirming that its choice was arbitrary \nand capricious. CMS offered virtually no response to commenters’ views that “[s]tates’ and \naccrediting entities’ review processes do not do enough to ensure enrollees have adequate access \nto necessary care,” simply asserting that its decision would “reduc[e] regulatory burden on \nissuers, while also preserving adequate access to care.” 83 Fed. Reg. at 17,025. In particular, \nCMS failed to provide evidence to buttress its assertion that state review procedures are \nsufficient to guarantee network adequacy, including, for example, an analysis of the rigor of state \nprocedures or assessments of plans certified by state regulators. That notwithstanding that \n“[a]long with lacking quantitative standards to ensure broad coverage, most states lack an \nadequate process to protect consumers forced to seek out-of-network treatment in particular \n35 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 40 of 148\ncases.”74 Similarly, CMS neglected to consider how an exchange operator may be uniquely \npositioned to assess plan adequacy. Because CMS did not sufficiently justify its decision, failed \nto adequately respond to comments, and failed to consider important aspects of the problem, its \ndecision in the 2019 Rule to outsource plan review on federally-facilitated exchanges to states \nwas arbitrary and capricious. \n63.  Outsourcing federal plan review to states will permit insurers to market plans with \noverly restrictive networks of providers—networks that could thereby limit patient access to \ncare. Even before the 2019 Rule, only 41 percent of qualified health plans in FFE states had \nnetworks that included National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers.75 Similarly, one \nstudy estimated that 15 percent of FFE plans lacked in-network physicians for at least one \nspecialty.76 These numbers will continue to fall now that the federal government has shirked its \nplan review responsibilities. More consumers will end up purchasing inadequate plans, either \nthrough necessity or confusion—meaning that a greater share of the population will obtain \ninsurance coverage that is insufficient to meet their health care needs. The rate of the \nunderinsured will therefore increase. \n3.  Reducing Oversight of Insurance Brokers Participating in Direct \nEnrollment \n64.  By reducing federal oversight of insurance brokers that assist consumers in \nsigning up for insurance on ACA exchanges via direct enrollment, see id. at 16,981-82, the 2019 \n                                                 \n74   Mark Hall & Caitlin Brandt, Network Adequacy Under the Trump Administration, Health \nAffairs Blog, Sept. 14, 2017, \nhttps://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20170914.061958/full/. \n75   Kenneth L. Kehl et al., Access to Accredited Cancer Hospitals Within Federal Exchange \nPlans Under the Affordable Care Act, 35 J. Clinical Oncology 645, 647 (2017). \n76   Stephen C. Dorner et al., Adequacy of Outpatient Specialty Care Access in Marketplace \nPlans Under the Affordable Care Act, JAMA Network (2015), \nhttps://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2466113. \n36 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 41 of 148\nRule will enable brokers to provide consumers with incorrect information and permit brokers to \ndeny consumers the assistance that they need, and that the ACA requires, so that they can \nidentify and purchase the health insurance that best meets their situation. \n65.  Direct enrollment is a process under which a consumer enrolls in an ACA-\ncompliant health insurance plan through a third-party website instead of through the \ngovernmental platform (HealthCare.gov for FFEs). Direct enrollment entities are “agents, \nbrokers, and issuers that participate in direct enrollment and use their own internet website for \n[qualified health plan] selection or to complete the Exchange eligibility application.” Id. at \n16,981. Given evidence that direct enrollment entities were committing fraud, signing up \nindividuals without their knowledge or consent, and using inaccurate calculators for APTC \neligibility, prior rules provided a strong oversight structure and required such entities to be \naudited by third parties that HHS approved. \n66.  The 2019 Rule eliminates this protection and permits agents, brokers, and issuers \nparticipating in direct enrollment to “select their own third-party entities for conducting audits, \nrather than requiring HHS to initially review and approve these entities”—i.e., to select an \nauditor that has not been approved by HHS to determine whether the agent, broker, or issuer is \nready to handle direct enrollment in compliance with relevant requirements. Id. \n67.  CMS’s decision to weaken oversight over direct enrollment entities is arbitrary \nand capricious and must be set aside. First, CMS failed to grapple with evidence, well known to \nthe agency, that direct enrollment entities have in the past produced poor information for \nconsumers, facilitating consumers’ poor enrollment choices. That evidence is what necessitated \nCMS oversight of direct enrollment entities’ auditors in the first place. Second, and relatedly, \nCMS failed to adequately respond to comments expressing “concern[] that enrollment through a \n37 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 42 of 148\nnon-governmental site would occur without proper oversight and controls.” Id. at 16,982. Indeed, \nCMS offers no meaningful response, and instead asserts, without evidence, that it “believe[s]” \nthat its decision “will ensure that quality operational readiness reviews are conducted.” Id. \n68.  Scaling back oversight of agents, brokers, and issuers that participate in direct \nenrollment will increase the likelihood that consumers receive inaccurate information, thus \ndecreasing overall enrollment and leading to a rise in the rate of the uninsured.77 CMS’s decision \nto shirk its responsibilities will also lead to a rise in the rate of the underinsured, as confusion \naround APTC eligibility facilitated by CMS’s withdrawal will lead individuals to choose plans \nthat are not appropriate to their needs.  \n  Deterring Americans from Enrolling in Quality Health Insurance Plans \n69.  Other provisions of the 2019 Rule make it more difficult for consumers to enroll \nin ACA-compliant health insurance coverage. \n1.  Making It Harder to Compare Insurance Plans \n70.  A key function of the exchanges is to “allow[] people to compare and purchase” \nqualified health plans. King, 135 S. Ct. at 2485. In order to carry out this obligation—”to \nsimplify the consumer shopping experience and to allow consumers to more easily compare \nplans across issuers”—prior rules supported “standardized options,” which are qualified health \nplans at different levels of coverage with a cost-sharing structure specified by HHS, including \n                                                 \n77   After issuing the 2019 Rule, CMS amplified the effects of the provision weakening oversight \nover agents, brokers, and issuers that participate in direct enrollment by unveiling “enhanced \ndirect enrollment” for FFE and hybrid exchange states, which aims to increase the number of \nconsumers using direct enrollment. See CMS, Enhanced Direct Enrollment for 2019 FAQs (Nov. \n28, 2018), https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Programs-and-Initiatives/Health-Insurance-\nMarketplaces/Downloads/FAQs-EDE.pdf. This purportedly “streamline[d] consumer \nexperience” for direct enrollment, id., will expose additional health insurance purchasers to \nunder-regulated agents, brokers, and issuers. \n \n38 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 43 of 148\nfixed deductibles, fixed annual limitations on cost-sharing, and fixed copayments or coinsurance \nfor certain specified benefits.78  \n71.  HHS supported standardized options given its recognition that “[a]n excessive \nnumber of health plan options makes consumers less likely to make any plan selection, more \nlikely to make a selection that does not match their health needs, and more likely to make a \nselection that leaves them less satisfied.”79 HHS further stated that its experience during prior \n“open enrollment periods suggests that many consumers, particularly those with a high number \nof health plan options, find the large variety of cost-sharing structures available on the \nExchanges difficult to navigate.” 80 Fed. Reg. at 75,542. HHS determined that “standardized \noptions will provide these consumers the opportunity to make simpler comparisons of plans \noffered by different issuers within a metal level,” and to “focus their decision making on the \nproviders in the plan networks, premiums, benefits, and quality,” and prevent consumers from \nhaving “to make complex tradeoffs among cost-sharing differences among a large number of \nplans.” Id. “For the 2017 and 2018 benefit years, HHS specified standardized options in \nrulemaking, encouraged issuers to offer such plans, and provided differential display of these \nplans on HealthCare.gov.” 83 Fed. Reg. at 16,974. \n72.  Notwithstanding the agency’s own understanding of their effectiveness, the 2019 \nRule discontinues support for standardized options. See id. at 16,974-75. CMS’s decision to do \nso is arbitrary and capricious. CMS claims that standardized options stymied innovation, \n“removing incentives for issuers to offer coverage with innovative plan designs.” Id. at 16,974. \n                                                 \n78   See CMS, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment \nParameters for 2017, 81 Fed. Reg. 12,204, 12,205, 12,289-293 (Mar. 8, 2016) (final rule). \n79   See HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters for 2017, 80 Fed. Reg. 75,488, 75,542 \n(Dec. 2, 2015) (proposed rule); see id. at 75,542 & nn.31-32 (citing data). \n39 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 44 of 148\nYet CMS has cited no data to support that contention. Furthermore, CMS offered no reasonable \nresponse to commenters who pointed out that standardized options “are a useful consumer-\nsupport tool that aids in plan comparisons and selection,” that their presence in fact “encourages \nissuers to innovate on other plan features and encourages issuers to compete on networks and \nformularies,” and that their withdrawal “could create confusion for consumers, especially those \nwith low health literacy or certain health conditions.” Id. at 16,975 (emphasis added). CMS has \nnot adequately explained its decision to make comparison shopping more difficult. \n73.  By eliminating support for standardized options on federal exchanges, the 2019 \nRule makes it more difficult for consumers to select appropriate health coverage, and also \nincreases the risk that they will go without coverage entirely. These effects will, in turn, increase \nthe size of the underinsured and uninsured populations. Indeed, CMS itself cited commenters \nwho pointed out “that removing the standardized option designation could make plan selection \nmore difficult resulting in fewer people enrolling in QHPs.” Id. \n74.  Moreover, eliminating support for standardized options will limit the degree to \nwhich health plans will compete on price; instead, some plans will choose to compete on benefit \ndesign in a gambit to discourage high-risk enrollees. Research found that after Massachusetts \nstandardized its plans, consumers placed additional weight on cost-sharing features of their plan \nselections.80 Covered California, which runs California’s ACA exchange, attributes some of its \nsuccess in offering affordable choices to its use of standardized plans.81 Without standardized \n                                                 \n80   Keith M. Marzilli Ericson, & Amanda Starc, How Product Standardization Affects Choice: \nEvidence from the Massachusetts Health Insurance Exchange, 50 J. Health Econ. 71 (2016). \n81   Shelby Livingston, How California Made Obamacare Work, Modern Healthcare, June 13, \n2017, http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20170613/NEWS/170619961. \n40 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 45 of 148\noptions, it will be harder for individuals to select coverage, prices will rise, and the rate of the \nuninsured and underinsured will increase.  \n2.  Undermining the Navigator Program \n75.  As explained above, the ACA requires exchanges to award grants to healthcare \n“Navigators” that are responsible for helping individuals enroll in qualified health plans. 42 \nU.S.C. § 18031(i). Under HHS’s prior rules, each exchange was required to have two \nNavigators, one of those Navigators was required to be a community- and consumer-focused \nnonprofit, and Navigators were required to have physical presences in the areas they served.82 \nCMS decided to eliminate these requirements in the 2019 Rule. See 83 Fed. Reg. at 16,979-80. \nIts decision violates the APA in multiple ways. \n76.  First, CMS’s decision to eliminate these requirements is contrary to law because it \npermits entities to qualify as Navigators that cannot satisfy the relevant statutory criteria. Among \nother things, Navigators must “conduct public education activities to raise awareness of the \navailability of qualified health plans,” 42 U.S.C. § 18031(i)(3)(A); “distribute fair and impartial \ninformation concerning enrollment in qualified health plans, and the availability of premium tax \ncredits . . . and cost-sharing reductions,” id. § 18031(i)(3)(B); “facilitate enrollment in qualified \nhealth plans,” id. § 18031(i)(3)(C); provide enrollees with grievances, complaints, or questions \nabout their health plans with referrals to specified entities, id. § 18031(i)(3)(D); and “provide \ninformation in a manner that is culturally and linguistically appropriate to the needs of the \npopulation being served by the Exchange or Exchanges,” id. § 18031(i)(3)(E). But Navigators \nwithout a physical presence in an exchange service area cannot, in the terms CMS itself used in \n                                                 \n82   See 45 C.F.R. §§ 155.210(c)(2), 155.210(e)(7), 155.215(h) (effective May 9, 2016 to June \n17, 2018).  \n41 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 46 of 148\nproposing the physical presence requirement, “provide[]” “face-to-face assistance . . . to \napplicants and enrollees”83—they therefore cannot adequately carry out the statutory duties \nsummarized above.  \n77.  The statute also requires Navigators to “demonstrate to the Exchange involved \nthat [they have] existing relationships, or could readily establish relationships, with employers \nand employees, consumers (including uninsured and underinsured consumers), or self-employed \nindividuals likely to be qualified to enroll in a qualified health plan.” 42 U.S.C. § 18031(i)(2)(A). \nThe prior requirement that exchanges award grants to at least two Navigators, and that one be a \ncommunity- and consumer-focused nonprofit, faithfully implemented this statutory mandate; the \n2019 Rule’s elimination of these requirements violates it. Current Navigators will potentially be \nreplaced by organizations with conflicts of interest because commissions prompt them to steer \nenrollees to particular insurers. New Navigators may also have an incentive to discourage \nenrollment of high-cost enrollees. \n78.  Second, the 2019 Rule’s elimination of the physical presence requirement is \narbitrary and capricious. As noted above, in proposing the requirement CMS understandably \nrecognized that face-to-face assistance is necessary for Navigators to carry out their statutorily \nrequired duties. 79 Fed. Reg. at 15,832. In response to CMS’s proposal to eliminate the \nrequirement, “many commenters [stated] that entities not physically present in an Exchange \nservice area may not be able to provide a full spectrum of local outreach, education, and \nassistance to support enrollment and post-enrollment activities”; “[m]any commenters” also \nstated “that removing this requirement would negatively affect hard-to-reach populations, as the \n                                                 \n83   CMS, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Exchange and Insurance Market \nStandards for 2015 and Beyond, 79 Fed. Reg. 15,808, 15,832 (Mar. 21, 2014). \n42 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 47 of 148\nin-person assistance provided by Navigator entities is often the only known resource and form of \nsupport for some low-income and other at-risk populations”; and “some commenters [stated] that \nweb or phone-based assistance is a poor substitute for in-person assistance delivered by a known \nand trusted community-based organization, and that this is particularly true for those living with \nsignificant health needs for whom remote assistance may prove inadequate and frustrating.” 83 \nFed. Reg. at 16,980. On top of that, CMS acknowledged—twice—”that entities with a physical \npresence and strong relationships in their [exchange] service areas tend to deliver the most \neffective outreach and enrollment results.” Id.; see id. at 16,979-80 (similar). Yet HHS \neliminated the requirement. That is arbitrary and capricious. \n79.  The Administration’s actions will decrease individuals’ and families’ in-person \naccess to complete, impartial information. In so doing, they will dampen overall enrollment, \nespecially among vulnerable populations, and thereby increase the rate of the uninsured. People \nwho receive in-person assistance are nearly 40 percent more likely to enroll in coverage than \npeople who are forced to go it alone.84 In-person assistance is particularly important for young \npeople and minority populations, especially Latinos. A study conducted during the ACA’s first \nopen enrollment period found that two out of every five young people who successfully enrolled \nin coverage received help from a Navigator.85 Another study found that nearly 50 percent of \n                                                 \n84   Sara R. Collins et al., Following the ACA Repeal-and-Replace Effort, Where Does the U.S. \nStand on Insurance Coverage?, Commonwealth Fund (Sept. 7, 2017), \nhttp://www.commonwealthfund.org/Publications/Issue-Briefs/2017/Sep/Post-ACA-Repeal-and-\nReplace-Health-Insurance-Coverage.  \n85   Deloitte, Young Adults and Health Insurance: Not Invincible--but Perhaps Convincible \nFindings from the Deloitte 2014 Survey of Young Adults and Health Insurance 6 (2014), \nhttps://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/life-sciences-health-care/us-chs-\nyoung-adults-and-health-insurance.pdf.  \n \n43 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 48 of 148\nLatinos who successfully enrolled received in-person assistance.86 Decreased in-person access to \nNavigators makes it more difficult for individuals to shop for appropriate health insurance, and \nwill lead to a rise in the uninsured and underinsured. \n3.  Making Small Business Exchanges Less User-Friendly \n80.  The ACA requires exchanges to “provide[]for the establishment of a Small \nBusiness Health Options Program”—a “‘SHOP Exchange’[] that is designed to assist” certain \n“small employers in facilitating the enrollment of their employees in qualified health plans \noffered in the small group market.” 42 U.S.C. § 18031(b)(1)(B).87 The ACA further requires \nSHOP exchanges to “make available qualified health plans to . . . qualified employers,” id. \n§ 18031(d)(2)(A); to protect employers’ and employees’ choice among certain qualified health \nplans, see id. § 18032(a)(2); and to protect employees’ ability to enroll even after their employer \nno longer qualifies as a small employer under the Act, see id. § 18024(b)(4)(D). \n81.  Under prior rules, CMS interpreted the ACA as “requir[ing] that all SHOPs \nprovide for employer eligibility, employee eligibility, and certain enrollment functions, including \npremium aggregation functions.” 83 Fed. Reg. at 16,996. Provisions of the 2019 Rule purport to \nreinterpret the ACA and remove these requirements. See id. at 16,996-17,006. In so doing, these \nprovisions are contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious. First, the removal of these \nrequirements permits SHOPs that cannot fulfill their statutory duties, described above, which \nviolates the ACA’s text. Second, although CMS purported to justify its decision by reference to \n                                                 \n86   Adrian Garcia Mosqueira & Benjamin D. Sommers, Better Outreach Critical to ACA \nEnrollment, Particularly for Latinos, To the Point, Jan. 14, 2016, \nhttp://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/blog/2016/jan/better-outreach-critical-to-aca-\nenrollment-particularly-for-latinos.  \n87   See 42 U.S.C. § 18024(b)(2) (defining “small employer”). See generally Small Business \nHealth Options Program (SHOP), CMS, https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Programs-and-\nInitiatives/Health-Insurance-Marketplaces/SHOP.html.  \n44 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 49 of 148\ndeclining enrollment in SHOPs, see, e.g., id. at 16,996, making SHOPs even less functional and \nless user friendly will exacerbate the very problem CMS cited. Because CMS’s interpretation \nviolates the statute and has not been well-reasoned, these provisions of the 2019 Rule violate the \nAPA. \n82.  By eliminating the requirement that SHOP exchanges allow employers to \ndetermine employee eligibility, aggregate premiums, and enroll employees online, the 2019 Rule \nmakes it more difficult for small businesses to offer workers and their dependents affordable \ncoverage, and thereby will increase the size of the uninsured population. These changes will also \npush small businesses to use a broker or buy directly from an insurance company, limiting their \nability to make plan comparisons and shop by price for appropriate coverage, potentially raising \ntheir premiums. \n4.  Imposing Unnecessary Income Verification Requirements \n83.  In general, the ACA makes advance premium tax credits available to individuals \npurchasing insurance on an exchange whose income is between 100-400 percent of the federal \npoverty line (“FPL”). See 26 U.S.C. § 36B; 42 U.S.C. §§ 18081, 18082. Out of purported \nconcern that individuals inflate their income above the FPL to gain APTCs, resulting in the \npayment of APTCs to those not entitled to receive them, provisions of the 2019 Rule impose \nincome verification requirements “where electronic data sources reflect income under 100 \npercent FPL and a consumer attests to income between 100 percent FPL and 400 percent FPL.” \n83 Fed. Reg. at 16,985; see id. at 16,985-87. \n84.  These provisions are arbitrary and capricious. Even though individuals have been \nseeking and receiving APTCs for years, in the 2019 Rule CMS “acknowledge[d] that it does not \nhave firm data on the number of applicants that might be inflating their income to gain APTC.” \n45 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 50 of 148\nId. at 16,986. Furthermore, CMS admitted that its new rules will disadvantage “households with \nlower income.” Id. CMS has no sufficient answer to the “many commenters” who “expressed \nconcern that low-income consumers have difficulty in providing documentation to resolve their \nannual income data matching issues and that [CMS’s new rules] would exacerbate that problem.” \nId. Moreover, because APTC is reconciled with actual income from tax data for the year in \nquestion, the concern about program integrity is overstated. Overall, it is more than ironic that in \nthe same rule that CMS repeatedly expresses a desire to cut red tape and reduce unnecessary \nregulation, it nonetheless increases bureaucratic hurdles for the most vulnerable Americans. That \ndisparity renders these new requirements irrational. Because the Administration has not \nadequately explained why burdensome income verification measures are needed, the provisions \nof the 2019 Rule that impose them are arbitrary and capricious. \n85.  By making it harder for consumers to obtain insurance tax credits, these \nprovisions of the 2019 Rule will likely mean that more consumers will choose to go without \ncoverage entirely—i.e., that the rate of the uninsured will increase. The deterrent effects of \npaperwork burdens are well-documented as a general matter.88 Moreover, in this specific \ncontext, paperwork burdens have historically deterred enrollment of people with relatively low \nneed for health care; those with high health care needs will work harder to get coverage.89 For \n                                                 \n88   See, e.g., Tricia Brooks, Why is NH Proposing to Replace Proven Electronic Citizenship \nVerification with Burdensome Medicaid Paperwork Requirements?, Georgetown University \nHealth Policy Institute, Center for Children and Families (June 28, 2018), \nhttps://ccf.georgetown.edu/2018/06/28/why-is-nh-proposing-to-replace-proven-electronic-\ncitizenship-verification-with-burdensome-medicaid-paperwork-requirements/.  \n89   Stan Dorn, Helping Special Enrollment Periods Work Under the Affordable Care Act 5-6, \nUrban Institute (June 2016), \nhttps://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/81806/2000834-Helping-Special-\nEnrollment-Periods-Work-Under-the-Affordable-Care-Act.pdf.  \n \n46 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 51 of 148\nexample, a verification pilot study found that only 55 percent of young adults submitted required \ndocuments compared to 73 percent of older applicants.90 As such, extending verification to \nadditional groups will worsen the risk pool and raise premiums, causing coverage to become less \naffordable.  \n86.  This challenge will be even greater among the lower-income enrollees targeted by \nthis policy since they are more likely to have fluctuating income, part-year or part-time \nemployment, and multiple employers, and to have difficulty accessing and supplying necessary \ndocumentation. One analysis estimates that 50 percent of adults with income below 200 percent \nof the poverty level experience income changes that make them move between eligibility for \nMedicaid and the exchanges.91  \n  Driving Up Costs \n87.  Lastly, other provisions of the 2019 Rule make health insurance coverage more \nexpensive for consumers. \n1.  Curtailing Review of Insurance Rate Increases \n88.  The 2019 Rule decreases the federal government’s role in reviewing insurance \nrates, giving insurers greater flexibility to increase premiums without any justification. Under the \nACA, “[t]he Secretary, in conjunction with States, shall establish a process for the annual \nreview . . . of unreasonable increases in premiums for health insurance coverage.” 42 U.S.C. § \n                                                 \n90  Pre-Enrollment Verification for Special Enrollment Periods, CMS, \nhttps://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Fact-Sheets-and-FAQs/Downloads/Pre-Enrollment-\nSEP-fact-sheet-FINAL.PDF.  \n91   Benjamin D. Sommers & Sara Rosenbaum, Issues in Health Reform: How Changes in \nEligibility May Move Millions Back and Forth Between Medicaid and Insurance Exchanges, \nHealth Affairs (Feb. 2011), https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/abs/10.1377/hlthaff.2010.1000.  \n47 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 52 of 148\n300gg-94(a)(1). Pursuant to this statutory duty, CMS has promulgated regulations that require \ninsurers to justify annual rate increases above a given threshold. See 45 C.F.R. §§ 154.101 et seq. \n89.  The 2019 Rule, however, changes this scheme—and thereby flouts CMS’s \nstatutory duties—in two respects. First, the 2019 Rule exempts student health plans from rate \nreview beginning July 1, 2018. 83 Fed. Reg. at 16,972. Second, the 2019 Rule raises the \nthreshold for rate review to rate increases of 15 percent rather than the current 10 percent. Id. at \n16,972-73. Both of these changes limit the federal government’s review of unwarranted rate \nincreases and are unlawful.  \n90.  To start, the 2019 Rule’s carve-out for student health plans is contrary to the text \nof the ACA. As explained above, the ACA requires review of “unreasonable increases in \npremiums for health insurance coverage,” 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-94(a)(1), which are defined as \n“benefits consisting of medical care,” id. § 300gg-91(b)(1)—a term that encompasses student \nhealth plans, which plainly provide medical care benefits like any other health insurance plan. \nCurrently, the only exceptions to rate review are for “excepted benefits” and “grandfathered \nhealth plan” coverage, both of which are mandated by statute, see 42 U.S.C. §§ 300gg-91(c), \n18011, and for large group plan rates, which are negotiated on a group-by-group basis and \ntherefore cannot be effectively reviewed. By its plain terms, therefore, the ACA requires rate \nreview of student health plans. \n91.  Moreover, the 2019 Rule’s student health plan exception is arbitrary and \ncapricious. As CMS admitted, “[s]tudent health insurance coverage is considered by HHS to be a \ntype of individual market coverage and is generally subject to . . . individual market \nrequirements.” 83 Fed. Reg. at 16,972. CMS provided an insufficient explanation for its decision \nto change course and treat student health plans like large group plans rather than individual \n48 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 53 of 148\nplans. CMS also failed to meaningfully address comments that explained how exempting such \nplans “would result in minimal oversight and decreased affordability.” Id. Instead, CMS argued \nthat states can step in by engaging in rate review themselves. Id. Acknowledging that some states \nlack “an Effective Rate Review Program,” however, CMS claimed that it would continue to \nmonitor rates “based on complaints and as part of targeted market conduct examinations,” id.—\nignoring the need for automatic, systemic review of increased rates that underlies the rate review \nprogram. \n92.  The 2019 Rule’s increased threshold for rate review is also arbitrary and \ncapricious. CMS raised the threshold “in recognition of significant rate increases,” 83 Fed. Reg. \nat 16,972—but larger rate increases are a reason for more, rather than less, review. CMS also \ngave short shrift to the “many” commenters concerned about increasing rates, arguing that the \nincreased threshold would have implicated only one rate filing later found to be unreasonable. Id. \nat 16,973. In doing so, CMS ignored the fact that one of the core functions of rate review is to \ndeter unreasonable increases from being submitted in the first place. CMS again invoked state \nrate review procedures as a stopgap measure, see id.—meaning that its explanation is again \ndeficient for the reasons stated above. All told, CMS failed to consider important aspects of the \nproblem, rendering its decision arbitrary and capricious. \n93.  Overall, the 2019 Rule’s unlawful changes to rate review will make it easier for \ninsurers to increase rates without adequate justification; the purpose of rate review is for \ninsurance commissioners and the public to examine the proposed reasons for health insurance \npremium increases in the individual and small-group market and adjust them as appropriate to \nimprove affordability for consumers. In 2011, one in five proposed premium increases was \nreduced through rate review, with rates that went into effect approximately one-fifth lower than \n49 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 54 of 148\nthose initially requested by the insurer.92 In 2015, rate review lowered premiums in the \nindividual and small group markets by $1.5 billion.93 And if prices are permitted to increase \nwithout the significant check provided by rate review, individuals will increasingly decide to go \nwithout appropriate coverage or any coverage at all—driving up the rate of uninsured and \nunderinsured individuals. \n2.  Reducing Rebates for Poor Insurer Performance \n94.  Lastly, the 2019 Rule makes it easier for insurers to avoid paying rebates to \nconsumers if they provide subpar coverage. Under the ACA, insurers must pay rebates if the \npercentage of each premium that they spend on paying claims and improving their services—the \n“medical loss ratio” or “MLR”—drops below 85 percent (for large group insurance plans) or 80 \npercent (for small group and individual insurance plans). 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-18(b)(1)(A). “These \nminimum MLR standards are intended to help ensure that individuals covered under private \nhealth insurance plans (enrollees) receive adequate value for their premiums and to create \nincentives for insurers to become more efficient in their operations.”94 \n95.  The 2019 Rule, however, alters the method by which rebates are awarded. The \nRule allows insurers to claim a flat 0.8 percent of premium credit for quality improvement \nactivities (“QIA”)—i.e., “activities that improve health care quality,” 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-\n18(a)(2)—when calculating medical loss ratio, rather than a percent based on the amount actually \n                                                 \n92   Kaiser Family Foundation, Quantifying the Effects of Health Insurance Rate Review 3 (Oct. \n2012), https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/8376.pdf. \n93   HHS, Rate Review Annual Report 5 (Dec. 2015), \nhttps://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Forms-Reports-and-Other-Resources/Downloads/Rate-\nReview-Annual-Report_508.pdf.  \n94   GAO-14-580, Private Health Insurance: Early Effects of Medical Loss Ratio Requirements \nand Rebates on Insurers and Enrollees 1, U.S. Government Accountability Office (July 2014), \nhttps://www.gao.gov/assets/670/664719.pdf. \n50 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 55 of 148\nspent on such activities, see 83 Fed. Reg. at 17,032-33. In other words, the 2019 Rule allows \ninsurers to take credit for improving their services whether or not they actually did so. This \nchange is unlawful.  \n96.  To start, allowing insurers to claim a flat credit for quality improvement activities \nis contrary to the text of the ACA. The ACA requires an issuer to report “the percentage of total \npremium revenue . . . that such coverage expends” for, among other things, “activities that \nimprove health care quality.” 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-18(a)(2). The statute’s language requires \ninsurers to report the amount actually spent on QIA—much like insurers are obligated to report \nhow much they actually spent on reimbursing claims. Id. § 300gg-18(a)(1). The statute does not \npermit CMS to instead throw up its hands and give every insurer the same credit, whether or not \nthe funds are actually expended. To the contrary, that approach undermines the statute’s clear \npurpose: to encourage insurers to improve the quality of their services, lest they be forced to pay \na rebate.95 \n97.  CMS’s decision is also arbitrary and capricious. CMS decided to allow insurers to \nclaim a flat credit because of what it saw as “issuers’ relatively low and consistent reported \nexpenditures on QIA and the significant burden associated with identifying, tracking, and \nreporting these expenditures.” 83 Fed. Reg. at 17,032. But CMS failed to corroborate its \nassertions of substantial burden, or to meaningfully address comments pointing out that \n“allowing issuers who spend nothing on QIA to take a standardized credit for QIA would \ndisincentivize issuers from making such investments.” Id. Recognizing the validity of those \nconcerns, CMS did modify its proposal to specify that insurers “that elect the standardized QIA \nreporting option must apply it consistently across all of their [s]tates and markets.” Id. at 17,033. \n                                                 \n95   Id. \n51 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 56 of 148\nThat is an inadequate bandaid; nothing would stop an insurer from consistently failing to engage \nin quality improvement and simply claiming the newly invented flat-rate credit for all their plans. \nCMS added that insurers have other incentives to improve quality, but Congress explicitly \ncreated the MLR scheme because it believed that additional incentives are necessary. \n98.  This change will increase the rate of the uninsured and underinsured. Since the \nACA’s medical loss ratio policy began in 2012, enrollees in the individual market have received \nnearly $4 billion in rebates.96 Those rebates are trending higher: insurers were required to pay \nnearly $707 million in rebates in 2018.97 And insurers paid rebates in each of the states at issue \nhere (Ohio, Maryland, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Virginia).98 By allowing insurers to \nincreasingly avoid paying these rebates, the 2019 Rule will effectively cause consumers to pay \nmore for worse insurance, leading to an increase in the number of consumers that lack \nappropriate coverage. \nII.  Additional Executive Actions Demonstrating Defendants’ Violation of Their \nConstitutional Duty to Faithfully Execute the ACA \n99.  As detailed above, the 2019 Rule includes at least nine separate provisions that \nillustrate how Defendants are violating their obligation to faithfully implement the Affordable \nCare Act. In addition, President Trump and his Administration have taken many other actions \nwith the intent and effect of sabotaging the Act generally and its private insurance reforms and \nexchanges in particular. Taken together, all of these actions—those described above and those \n                                                 \n96   Louise Norris, Billions in ACA Rebates Show 80/20 Rule’s Impact, HealthInsurance.org \n(Dec. 30, 2018), https://www.healthinsurance.org/obamacare/billions-in-aca-rebates-show-80-\n20-rules-impact/.  \n97   Id. \n98   Id. \n52 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 57 of 148\ndetailed below—establish Defendants’ pattern and practice of taking executive action to \nundermine the Act, and they demonstrate Defendants’ violation of the Take Care Clause. \n  Directing Agencies to Sabotage the Act \n100.  Hours after he was sworn in, President Trump signed Executive Order No. \n13,765, “Minimizing the Economic Burden of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \nPending Repeal,” 82 Fed. Reg. 8,351 (Jan. 20, 2017). The Order turned what had been candidate \nTrump’s promises to repeal the ACA into President Trump’s official policy. Id. § 1 (“It is the \npolicy of my Administration to seek the prompt repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable \nCare Act . . . .”). “[P]ending such repeal,” the Order directs Administration officials to “take all \nactions consistent with law to minimize the unwarranted economic and regulatory burdens of the \nAct.” Id.; see id. §§ 2-4. Yet President Trump’s estimation of whether or not the Act’s reforms \nare “warranted” does not, and must not, affect his obligation to take care that the Act is faithfully \nexecuted, and actions his Administration has characterized as “consistent with law” have flown \nin the face of that constitutional obligation. \n101.  Executive Order No. 13,765 is not merely a statement of policy. Rather, its \nissuance marked the start of the Trump Administration’s usurpation of Congress’s authority in its \nunilateral effort to repeal the ACA. The Order authorizes agencies to “waive, defer, grant \nexemptions from, or delay the implementation of any” ACA provision or requirement that, in the \nAdministration’s estimation, would impose fiscal or regulatory burdens. Id. § 2. As the press \nreported at the time, the Order “essentially allow[ed] the dismantling of the law to begin even \n53 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 58 of 148\nbefore Congress move[d] to repeal it.”99 Indeed, five days after signing the Executive Order, \nPresident Trump affirmed his agenda to “let [the ACA] explode” so as to be better positioned to \n“go in and . . . do a new plan.” “We’re gonna have an explosion,” he promised,100 and Executive \nOrder No. 13,765 delivered. \n102.  Joshua Peck, who served as Chief Marketing Officer for the federal government’s \nACA exchange (HealthCare.gov) until 2016, estimated that by signaling that the Administration \nmight not enforce the ACA’s individual mandate, Executive Order No. 13,765 resulted in \n130,000 fewer individuals enrolling in health insurance during the open enrollment period for \n2017 plan year insurance that was ongoing at the time.101 And as projected, within a month of its \nbeing issued, the Executive Order indeed resulted in reduced enforcement of the individual \nmandate,102 as further detailed below. \n103.  By issuing and implementing Executive Order No. 13,765, President Trump and \nhis Administration have violated their constitutional obligation to take care that the ACA is \nfaithfully executed. Rather, they have purposefully undermined the Act—the aim of which is to \nexpand access to quality coverage—in at least two ways. First, the Order has limited and will \nlikely continue to reduce progress in decreasing the number of uninsured Americans, directly \n                                                 \n99   Julie Hirschfield Davis & Robert Pear, Trump Issues Executive Order Scaling Back Parts of \nObamacare, New York Times, Jan. 20, 2017, \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/20/us/politics/trump-executive-order-obamacare.html. \n100  Transcript: ABC News Anchor David Muir Interviews President Trump, ABC News (Jan. 25, \n2017), http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/transcript-abc-news-anchor-david-muir-interviews-\npresident/story?id=45047602.  \n101  Joshua Peck, Trump Blocked Nearly 500,000 People From Getting Coverage, Medium, Feb. \n2, 2017, https://medium.com/get-america-covered/trumped-blocked-nearly-500-000-people-\nfrom-getting-coverage-70317eedaaa4. \n102  Michael Hiltzik, Trump’s IRS Stages a Stealth Attack on Obamacare, Los Angeles Times, \nFeb. 15, 2017, http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-irs-obamacare-20170215-\nstory.html. \n54 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 59 of 148\nundermining the Act’s aim. And second, by shrinking the risk pool, the Order will make health \ninsurance less affordable, a result counter to the Affordable Care Act’s central goal—a goal so \ncritical that it is featured in the Act’s title. \n  Attempting to Destabilize the Exchanges \n104.  As described above, Congress constructed the ACA to both support, and be \nsupported by, robust enrollment in ACA-compliant plans on ACA exchanges. Key to strong \nenrollment numbers are competitive exchanges with low premiums that attract a broad range of \nconsumers, not just those with high medical expenses, and a broad range of insurers, to foster \ncompetition. If one were setting out to weaken the exchanges, therefore, one could hardly do \nbetter than to sow uncertainty about the rules that govern them and the government support for \nthem. Insurance companies strive to minimize risk and uncertainty. When risk and uncertainty \nincrease, issuers raise premiums to compensate, or even exit insurance markets entirely. Sowing \nuncertainty in insurance markets is precisely what the Trump Administration has done from day \none, including by issuing Executive Order No. 13,765, described above, and by taking the \ndiscrete executive actions detailed below. \n105.  Exemplifying the Trump Administration’s strategy is the way in which the \nAdministration, over the course of the summer and the fall in 2017, repeatedly threatened to \ndiscontinue reimbursing insurers for cost-sharing reductions—to stop paying insurers back for \nthe reductions in copayments, coinsurance, and so on, that the Act requires them to provide to \nconsumers.103 At the time, pending litigation raised questions concerning those payments, but the \n                                                 \n103  See, e.g., Chad Terhune & Julie Appleby, Uncertainty Over Obamacare Leaves Next Year’s \nRates in Limbo, NPR, July 19, 2017, https://www.npr.org/sections/health-\nshots/2017/07/19/538099050/uncertainty-over-obamacare-leaves-next-years-rates-in-limbo; \nRobert Pear & Thomas Kaplan, Trump Threat to Obamacare Would Send Premiums and Deficits \n \n55 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 60 of 148\nmerits of those questions are not what is at issue here; rather, the Administration’s actions, aimed \ntoward provoking a legislative repeal, were deliberately designed to introduce uncertainty into \nthe exchanges through threats that the CSR payments would cease. As the President himself \nasserted, in one of his many intentionally intimidating statements, “If you don’t make them, [the \nACA exchange] fails.”104 \n106.  The threats served their purpose. Throughout the country, some insurers that had \npreviously sold health insurance through the exchanges for the 2017 plan year exited them \nentirely, refusing to offer coverage for the 2018 plan year because of the Administration’s refusal \nto guarantee that CSR payments would continue.105 That left some counties with decreased \ncompetition among issuers, which (again) drives up prices and decreases overall enrollment. \nIndeed, at the time, the Congressional Budget Office warned that terminating CSR payments \ncould increase the percentage of people living in areas not served by a single insurer between \n2018 and 2020.106 Other insurers raised premiums by as much as 23 percent for 2018 to guard \nagainst the risk that they would not receive the payments. And (again)—as the Administration \nknew—rising premiums and decreased enrollment threaten the long-term success of the ACA by \n                                                 \nHigher, New York Times, Aug. 15, 2017, https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/us/politics/cbo-\nobamacare-cost-sharing-reduction-trump.html.  \n104  Aaron Blake, President Trump’s Thoroughly Confusing Fox Business Interview, Annotated, \nWashington Post, Apr. 12, 2017, https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-\nfix/wp/2017/04/12/president-trumps-throughly-confusing-fox-business-interview-\nannotated/?utm_term=.0b4ab6f8b1a6. \n105  Rachel Roubein, No Certainty on Cost-sharing Payments to Insurers, The Hill, June 8, 2017, \nhttp://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/336974-no-certainty-on-cost-sharing-payments-to-insurers \n(citing the exit of Anthem in Ohio in particular). \n106  Congressional Budget Office, The Effects of Terminating Payments for Cost-Sharing \nReductions (Aug. 15, 2017), https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53009.  \n \n56 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 61 of 148\nincreasing adverse selection and weakening the market, leading to yet lower enrollment and \nhigher premiums. \n107.  Tellingly, the Trump Administration ultimately stopped making CSR payments \non October 12, 2017, shortly after the reconciliation instruction for legislation to repeal and \nreplace the ACA expired.107 Confirming his aim all along, days later President Trump declared \nthat the Act was “dead” and “gone,” and that “[t]here is no such thing as Obamacare \nanymore.”108 Some insurers and insurance commissioners adjusted to the Administration’s action \nby raising premiums rather than pulling out of the exchanges entirely. The Congressional Budget \nOffice estimated that 2018 Silver plan premiums were 10 percent higher because of the \nAdministration’s actions, and will be 20 percent higher by 2021.109 While few enrollees actually \npaid this sticker price in light of the ACA’s premium tax credits, this likely contributed to a \nreduction in enrollment among people not eligible for premium tax credits.110 And the cost to the \nfederal government of those premium tax credits—and, therefore, to federal taxpayers—\nballooned. \n108.  The Administration’s approach to CSR payments—create uncertainty at every \nturn—weakened insurance markets, particularly given the Administration’s timing.

Promoting Bare-Bones Plans to Try to Weaken ACA Exchanges \n109.  On October 12, 2017, President Trump signed Executive Order No. 13,813, \nentitled “Promoting Healthcare Choice and Competition Across the United States,” 82 Fed. Reg. \n48,385 (Oct. 12, 2017). Alleging that the ACA “has severely limited the choice of healthcare \noptions available to many Americans and has produced large premium increases in many State \nindividual markets for health insurance,” id. § 1(a), the Order directs the Administration to \n                                                 \n111  Mark Hall, Stabilizing and Strengthening the Individual Health Insurance Market: A View \nfrom Ten States 20, USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy (July 2018), \nhttps://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Stabilizing-and-Strenghtening-the-\nIndividual-Health-Insurance-Market2.pdf (alteration in original). \n112  Id. at 19. \n113  See American Academy of Actuaries, Drivers of 2019 Health Insurance Premium Changes \n2, 4, http://www.actuary.org/files/publications/Premium_Drivers_2019_061318.pdf (addressing \nthe effect of the elimination of cost-sharing reduction payments, and of expanded access to \nSTLDI and AHPs, on premiums). \n \n58 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 63 of 148\n“prioritize three areas for improvement in the near term: association health plans (AHPs), short-\nterm, limited-duration insurance (STLDI), and health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs),” id. \n§ 1(b). All three—AHPs, STLDI, and HRAs—provide coverage, often bare-bones coverage, that \ndoes not need to comply with the ACA’s requirements.114 For example, short-term, limited-\nduration insurance can refuse to offer coverage at all, or exclude coverage, for preexisting \nconditions; charge a higher rate based on an individual’s health history and health status; exclude \nbenefits such as prescription drugs, maternity care, mental health services, and substance use \ndisorder services; can include a dollar cap on services and stop paying medical bills after that cap \nis reached; and are not required to limit consumer out-of-pocket costs. \n110.  By directing his Administration to expand access to bare-bones plans like AHPs, \nSTLDI, and HRAs, Executive Order No. 13,813 will “open doors for young and healthy people \nto flee [the] ACA-compliant market,” i.e., the exchanges, “and find lower premiums” off of the \nexchanges.115 Because on-exchange purchasers will as a group be older and sicker than they have \n                                                 \n114  Association health plans purport to group small businesses, including self-employed workers, \ntogether to obtain coverage as though they were a single large employer. Short-term, limited-\nduration insurance, in keeping with its name, has historically been used to provide stop-gap \ncoverage, for example when an individual transitions from one type of major medical coverage \nto another. Health reimbursement arrangements, also known as health reimbursement accounts, \nare funds set aside by employers to reimburse employees for qualified medical expenses.

This will lead to \ndecreased enrollments in ACA-compliant plans, particularly among the young and healthy. The \nOrder will thereby increase costs and decrease coverage, phenomena that the ACA was designed \nto prevent. \n111.  Specifically, the Urban Institute estimated that expanded access to short-term, \nlimited duration policies would cause 2.6 million people to lose coverage in 2019.116 The Office \nof the Actuary at CMS projected that such enhanced access would increase premiums for ACA-\ncompliant plans by 3 to 6 percent.117 And one analysis estimated that increased access to \nassociation health plans would increase premiums for ACA-compliant individual market plans \nby 1.4 to 4.4 percent.118 Overall, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the combined \neffect of additional access to short-term, limited duration insurance and association health plans \nwould increase premiums for ACA-compliant plans by 2 to 3 percent, with 6 million people \nenrolling in these STLID and AHPs—plans with far fewer consumer protections.119 \n112.  Given this, it is no surprise that one analysis found that more than 98 percent of \nhealthcare groups that commented on the Administration’s proposed STLDI regulation expressed \n                                                 \nallowed to opt for cheaper noncompliant plans, then the risk pool for the compliant plans will \nworsen, driving their prices higher, and possibly to an unsustainable level.”). \n116  See Linda J.

In signing Executive Order No. 13,813, President Trump confirmed its intent, \nsaying, “I just keep hearing repeal-replace, repeal replace. Well, we’re starting that process.”121 \nAnd thus, by using Executive Order No. 13,813 to begin unilateral executive efforts to repeal the \nACA, the Administration directly usurped Congress’s lawmaking function.

Rand Paul, claimed to have worked directly with President Trump to craft the \nOrder, in order to achieve the reforms that Congress itself had failed to advance.122 And a \ncomparison of the Order with Sen. Paul’s proposed Obamacare Replacement Act, S. Bill No. \n222, 115th Congress (2017-18),123 reveals multiple similarities. \n                                                 \n120  Noam N.

In keeping with Executive Order No. 13,813’s directive, as of the date of this \nfiling the Administration has finalized rules expanding access to association health plans124 and \nshort-term limited duration insurance,125 and has proposed a rule expanding access to health \nreimbursement arrangements.126  \n115.  By issuing and implementing Executive Order No. 13,813, Defendants have \nviolated their constitutional obligation to take care that the ACA is faithfully executed. Rather, \nthey have purposefully undermined the Act—the aim of which is to expand access to quality \ncoverage—in at least two ways. First, the Order will result in fewer individuals receiving ACA-\ncompliant health insurance coverage, directly undermining the Act’s goal. And second, by \ndecreasing enrollments in ACA-compliant plans, the Order will increase premiums for quality \nplans, ultimately resulting in even fewer individuals being able to access affordable health care \ncoverage. \n2.  Undermining the Individual Mandate \n116.  As noted above, when Congress enacted the ACA it imposed an individual \nmandate that now, in light of congressional amendments in 2017, requires those without \ninsurance to make a shared responsibility payment through December 31, 2018. See 26 U.S.C. \n                                                 \n124  See Department of Labor, Definition of “Employer” Under Section 3(5) of ERISA—\nAssociation Health Plans, 83 Fed.

On February 14, 2017, citing President Trump’s Executive Order No. \n13,765, the Internal Revenue Service announced that it was scrapping a new policy that had been \ndesigned to strengthen the individual mandate by automatically rejecting tax returns of those \nwho fail to answer whether they had health insurance.127 The press reported that this change \nsignaled that the Administration was “loosening up on enforcement of . . . [the] individual \nmandate.”128 Indeed, the IRS confirmed that at the direction of Executive Order No. 13,765, its \ndecision aimed “to reduce potential burden”—i.e., to lessen enforcement—of the ACA.129  \n117.  Although the IRS subsequently reversed course, it waited until October 2017 to \ndo so.130 This was after insurers indicated, in summer 2017, that they would either raise \npremiums or withdraw from the market if they did not have clarity on enforcement prior to the \nSeptember 5, 2017 rate filing deadline.131 The months-long threat of underenforcement of the \nindividual mandate created uncertainty, thereby weakening markets and causing insurers to \nincrease prices. \n118.  On November 1, 2017, the first day of open enrollment, President Trump \nsuggested that Congress repeal the individual mandate as part of a tax reform package.132 He did \n                                                 \n127  See Peter Sullivan, IRS Loosening Enforcement of ObamaCare Mandate, The Hill, Feb. 15, \n2017, http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/319672-irs-takes-step-against-obamacare-mandate. \n128  Id. \n129  Id. \n130  Michael Cohn, IRS Won’t Accept Tax Returns Next Year Without Health Coverage, \nAccounting Today, Oct. 17, 2017, https://www.accountingtoday.com/news/irs-wont-accept-tax-\nreturns-next-year-without-health-coverage.  \n131  Rabah Kamal et al., An Early Look at 2018 Premium Changes and Insurer Participation on \nACA Exchanges, Kaiser Family Foundation (Aug. 10, 2017), https://www.kff.org/health-\nreform/issue-brief/an-early-look-at-2018-premium-changes-and-insurer-participation-on-aca-\nexchanges/ [hereinafter An Early Look]. \n132  @realDonaldTrump, Twitter (Nov. 1, 2017, 7:59 AM), \nhttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/925739132579729420.  \n \n63 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 68 of 148\nnot, like his predecessor, encourage people to review their health insurance options and sign up \nfor coverage.133 Then, on November 6, 2017, the press reported that in the face of Congress’s \nunwillingness to pass a bill repealing the individual mandate, President Trump was readying an \nexecutive order to attempt the same, by unilateral executive action.134 \n119.  Even after the 2017 tax bill reduced the shared responsibility payment to $0 for \nthe months starting after December 31, 2018, the Administration has endeavored to further \nweaken the individual mandate while the payment remains in effect. For example, when it issued \nthe 2019 Rule, CMS also issued guidance providing expanded access to so-called “hardship \nexemptions” from the mandate.135 Subsequently the Administration went even further: for the \n2018 tax year, CMS and the IRS have enabled more individuals purportedly eligible for such \nexemptions to simply claim them on their tax returns, rather than requiring them to submit \ndocumentary evidence or written explanation and seek certification from their ACA exchange.136  \n120.  There is no question that the ACA’s individual mandate has had an effect on \nindividuals’ decisions to purchase insurance.

Congress acted to reduce the shared responsibility payment associated with the \nmandate to $0 knowing that it would increase premiums by 10 percent in 2019. But prior to that, \nthe Trump Administration’s threats not to enforce the mandate drove up 2018 premiums all by \nthemselves. Preliminary analyses estimate that the deliberate uncertainty around the mandate’s \nenforcement that the Administration introduced accounted for up to a 20 percent increase in 2018 \nindividual market premiums.139 The Congressional Budget Office also attributed higher \npremiums for 2018 and insurer withdrawals from the exchanges to uncertainty about the \nenforcement of the individual mandate.140 Those premium increases, in turn, made it more \ndifficult for other segments of the population to obtain coverage, eroding coverage overall. \n122.

Refusing to Grant State Waiver Requests that Would Further the ACA’s \nGoals \n123.  Section 1332 of the ACA, 42 U.S.C. § 18052, permits states to apply for waivers \nof some of the law’s requirements in order to promote innovative policies that satisfy certain \nstatutorily-prescribed guardrails, see id. § 18052(b)(1). Crucially, for example, states may only \nseek waivers that would “provide coverage that is at least as comprehensive as” ACA-compliant \ncoverage. Id. § 18052(b)(1)(A). In keeping with these guardrails, only certain ACA provisions \nare subject to waiver under Section 1332. See id. § 18052(a)(2). Notably, the Act’s guaranteed-\nissue and community-rating requirements, which require insurers to offer comprehensive \ncoverage to individuals without regard to their medical conditions, are not waivable.  \n124.  Although the Trump Administration has encouraged states to apply for Section \n1332 waivers,141 it has either denied or not responded to many of the requests for waivers that it \nhas received,142 especially when it believes that granting the waivers would faithfully implement \n                                                 \n141  See, e.g., Letter from Thomas E. Price, former HHS Secretary, to state governors (Mar. 13, \n2017), https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Programs-and-Initiatives/State-Innovation-\nWaivers/Downloads/March-13-2017-letter_508.pdf (“We welcome the opportunity to work with \nstates on Section 1332 State Innovation Waivers….”). \n142  See Alison Kodak, Administration Sends Mixed Signals On State Health Insurance Waivers, \nNPR (Oct. 19, 2017), http://www.npr.org/sections/health-\nshots/2017/10/19/558310690/administration-sends-mixed-signals-on-state-health-insurance-\nwaivers.

(By contrast, the Administration has eagerly processed \nstate waivers that are designed to reduce access to quality health insurance143 and, as further \naddressed below, has encouraged states to seek such waivers.) Indeed, the Administration has \ndragged its feet even though some states’ waiver requests are designed to lower premiums and \nstabilize insurance markets. For example, the press reported that, upon learning about Iowa’s \nwaiver request and claims that the state’s plan would improve its exchange, President Trump \npersonally called Defendant Seema Verma, whose agency—CMS—is responsible for processing \nwaiver requests, and instructed her to deny Iowa’s application.144 \n125.  The Administration’s actions have frustrated states’ efforts to support the ACA \nand its reforms and to expand access to affordable, quality health insurance. For example, in \nwithdrawing its waiver request owing to the Administration’s delay, Oklahoma Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services Terry Cline stated that CMS’s failure to approve the waiver would \n“prevent thousands of Oklahomans from realizing the benefits of significantly lower insurance \npremiums in 2018.”145 \n                                                 \nWaivers/Section_1332_State_Innovation_Waivers-.html (listing pending, approved, and denied \nwaiver requests).  \n143  See Bruce Jaspen, Trump’s Medicaid Work Rules Hit States With Costs And Bureaucracy, \nForbes, July 22, 2018, https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2018/07/22/trumps-medicaid-\nwork-rules-hit-states-with-costs-and-bureaucracy/#745af26066f5; see also Stewart v.

By delaying and denying waiver requests, Defendants have violated their \nconstitutional obligation to take care that the ACA is faithfully executed. Rather, they have \npurposefully undermined the Act—the aim of which is to expand access to quality coverage—in \nat least two ways. First, delaying and denying waiver requests will result in fewer individuals \nreceiving ACA-compliant health insurance coverage overall, directly undermining the Act’s \ngoal. And second, delaying and denying waiver requests will weaken health insurance markets \nand increase premiums, ultimately resulting in even fewer individuals being able to access \naffordable health care coverage. \n4.  Enabling and Encouraging States to Seek Waivers that Would Undercut the \nACA’s Goals \n127.  The Administration’s manipulation of Section 1332 waivers to sabotage the ACA \nhas not been limited to delaying and denying waiver requests put forward by states that are \nattempting to faithfully implement the Act. The Administration has also taken official steps to \nsolicit and facilitate waiver requests designed to undermine the Act. In guidance issued by CMS, \nHHS, and the Department of the Treasury that purports to interpret Section 1332, the \nAdministration has in fact violated the Act, adopting a reading that permits, and even \nencourages, states to seek waivers that would promote plans that lack the Act’s consumer \nprotections.146 For example, the guidance specifies that “[a] section 1332 state plan should foster \nhealth coverage through competitive private coverage, including AHPs and STLDI plans.” 83 \nFed. Reg. at 53,577 (emphasis added). The Administration subsequently supplemented that \nguidance with a discussion paper that describes a series of “concepts” for waivers that states \n                                                 \n146  CMS, Guidance, State Relief and Empowerment Waivers, 83 Fed.

By issuing the guidance, Defendants have violated their constitutional obligation \nto take care that the ACA is faithfully executed. Rather, they have purposefully undermined the \nAct—the aim of which is to expand access to quality coverage—in at least three ways. First, the \nguidance cannot be squared with the ACA’s text, structure, or purpose. Second, and relatedly, \nthe guidance will result in fewer individuals receiving ACA-compliant health insurance coverage \noverall, directly undermining the Act’s goal. And third, the guidance will result in weaker health \ninsurance markets and increased premiums, ultimately resulting in even fewer individuals being \nable to access affordable health care coverage. \n5.  Attempting to Weaken Public Confidence in ACA Exchanges \n129.  Statements by President Trump and others in his Administration confirm that the \ndriving force behind all of the Administration’s actions described here is to sabotage the \nAffordable Care Act. As exemplified by the statements catalogued above, see supra ¶¶ 44-48, \nthe Trump Administration has been relentless in its efforts to paint a false picture of the Act as \nfailing—or even, in President Trump’s words at a meeting of his Cabinet, as already “dead. It’s \ngone. It’s no longer—you shouldn’t even mention [it]. It’s gone. There is no such thing as \nObamacare anymore.”148 The number of times that President Trump and others in his \n                                                 \n147  CMS, Section 1332 State Relief and Empowerment Waiver Concepts: Discussion Paper \n(Nov. 29, 2018), https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Programs-and-Initiatives/State-Innovation-\nWaivers/Downloads/Waiver-Concepts-Guidance.PDF. \n148  Remarks by President Trump in Cabinet Meeting, The White House (Oct. 16, 2017), \navailable at https://web.archive.org/web/20171016180503/https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-\npress-office/2017/10/16/remarks-president-trump-cabinet-meeting. \n \n69 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 74 of 148\nAdministration have called “Obamacare . . . a disaster” can barely be counted.149 The President \nhas even gone so far as to assert that “ObamaCare is torturing the American People.”150 Vice \nPresident Mike Pence has called Obamacare a “nightmare.”151 \n130.  It would be one thing if the Administration’s only goal were to build public \nopposition to the Act, but that is not the case. Rather, the Administration’s communications \nstrategy is aimed at creating a false public impression about the ACA and reducing public \nconfidence in the law and its exchanges, thereby discouraging individuals from enrolling in \nACA-compliant insurance and weakening the exchanges. In March 2017, for example, HHS \nlaunched an official website alleging “skyrocketing premiums and narrowing choices” in ACA \nexchanges and asserting that the ACA “has done damage to” the market for individual insurance \nand “created great burdens for many Americans.”152 An official WhiteHouse.gov page likewise \nproclaims that “Obamacare is hurting American families, farmers, and small businesses with \n                                                 \n149  See, e.g., Jacqueline Thomsen, Trump Vows to Repeal and Replace ObamaCare ‘Disaster’, \nThe Hill, Nov. 23, 2017, http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/361693-trump-vows-to-\nrepeal-and-replace-obamacare-disaster; Jay Willis, President Trump Couldn’t Repeal the \nAffordable Care Act, So He’s Trying to Sabotage It Instead, GQ, Sept. 1, 2017, \nhttps://www.gq.com/story/trump-sabotage-obamacare-marketing (collecting examples). \n150  @realDonaldTrump, Twitter (July 25, 2017, 6:38 AM), \nhttps://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/889796918615920640.  \n151  Juliet Eilperin et al., White House’s Decision to Atop ACA Cost-sharing Subsidies Triggers \nStrong Opposition, Washington Post, Oct. 13, 2017, \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/white-house-tells-court-it-is-immediately-stopping-\naca-cost-sharing-subsidies/2017/10/13/4c404234-b01d-11e7-be94-\nfabb0f1e9ffb_story.html?noredirect=on&undefined=&utm_term=.2cc7c1747873&wpisrc=nl_m\nost&wpmm=1.  \n152  Providing Relief Right Now for Patients, HHS, https://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/empowering-\npatients/providing-relief-right-now-for-patients/index.html.  \n \n70 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 75 of 148\nskyrocketing health insurance costs.”153 And HHS press officials have labored to paint a picture \nof the ACA as “continu[ing] to collapse” and as having “been in a death spiral for years.”154 \n131.  Less visibly, recent reports from the Sunlight Foundation have documented how \nHHS has systematically removed information about the ACA from its websites.155 Worse, \nSenators Schatz, Booker, and Murphy, “concerned that the use of appropriated funds to promote \nlegislation pending before Congress” to repeal the ACA “violate both HHS’s constitutional \nresponsibility to implement existing law, and legal prohibitions against using taxpayer dollars to \nlobby in favor of pending legislation,” have collected numerous examples where HHS social \nmedia accounts published “anti-ACA propaganda.”156 For example, then-Secretary of HHS Tom \nPrice tweeted videos that his agency produced to discredit the Act, see infra ¶ 152, with an \nexplicit admonition discouraging enrollment, commenting that “[u]nder Obamacare, coverage ≠ \ncare.”157 Sec.

By working to weaken public confidence in the ACA and its exchanges, \nDefendants have violated their constitutional obligation to take care that the ACA is faithfully \nexecuted. Rather, they have purposefully undermined the Act—the aim of which is to expand \naccess to quality coverage—in at least two ways. First, declining public confidence in the ACA’s \ninsurance markets will result in fewer individuals receiving ACA-compliant health insurance \ncoverage overall, directly undermining the Act’s goal. And second, declining public confidence \nwill weaken health insurance markets and increase premiums, ultimately resulting in even fewer \nindividuals being able to access affordable health care coverage. \n  Working to Decrease Enrollment \n133.  Under the ACA, exchanges must “facilitate[] the purchase of qualified health \nplans.” 42 U.S.C. § 18031(b)(1)(a). Defendants, however, have shirked this duty in multiple \nways, as detailed below, including by slashing funding for advertising and outreach and cutting \nin half the length of time during which federally-facilitated exchanges are open for enrollment. \n134.  As further discussed below, the Administration’s efforts to discourage enrollment \nare having effects.

Shortening Open Enrollment \n135.  As described above, the ACA requires HHS to establish “annual open enrollment \nperiods” during which individuals, via the exchanges, can enroll in new or different health \ninsurance coverage for the coming year. 42 U.S.C. § 18031(c)(6)(B). Outside of open \nenrollment, individuals may enroll in coverage through an exchange only if they qualify for a \nspecial enrollment period, see id. § 18031(c)(6)(C), based on certain life events like getting \nmarried, having a baby, or losing other health coverage. The opportunity to buy insurance \nthrough the exchange is generally limited to established open enrollment periods in order to \nminimize adverse selection. If consumers could buy health insurance through an exchange at any \ntime throughout the year, they could wait until they got sick to purchase insurance and drop it \nonce they recover. \n136.  The open enrollment period for 2016 plans ran from November 1, 2015 through \nJanuary 31, 2016.160 Likewise, the open enrollment period for 2017 plans ran from November 1, \n2016 through January 31, 2017.161 \n                                                 \n159  Covered California, Individual Markets Nationally Face High Premium Increases in Coming \nYears Absent Federal or State Action, With Wide Variation Among States 3 (Mar. 8, 2018), \nhttp://hbex.coveredca.com/data-research/library/CoveredCA_High_Premium_Increases_3-8-\n18.pdf [hereinafter March 2018 Covered California Study].  \n160  2016 Marketplace Open Enrollment Period Public Use Files, CMS, \nhttps://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-\nReports/Marketplace-Products/2016_Open_Enrollment.html.  \n161  CMS, Health Insurance Marketplaces 2017 Open Enrollment Period Final Enrollment \nReport: November 1, 2016 - January 31, 2017 (Mar. 15, 2017), \nhttps://www.cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/Fact-sheets/2017-Fact-Sheet-\nitems/2017-03-15.html.  \n \n73 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 78 of 148\n137.  In April 2017, however, the Trump Administration announced that it was cutting \nthe open enrollment period for 2018 plans in half compared to prior years, setting it to run from \nNovember 1, 2017 through December 15, 2017.162 Shortly thereafter, President Trump tweeted \nthat “ObamaCare is in serious trouble” and that “it dies far sooner than anyone would have \nthought.”163 \n138.  In addition, HHS told community groups that the federal health insurance \nexchange, HealthCare.gov, would be subject to “[p]lanned” “[d]owntime” during the open \nenrollment period for 2018 plans, for an “[o]vernight outage on Wednesday, November 1, 2017”; \nand on “Sundays [from] 12am-12pm ET, except on December 10, 2017”164—a significant \nincrease in downtime from prior years. While the actual downtime for the open enrollment \nperiod for 2018 plans proved less than what had been announced, that fact was not \ncommunicated, which may have been discouraged enrollment during the times slated for \noutages. The Administration announced a maintenance schedule for the open enrollment period \nfor 2019 plans similar to that which it had announced for the open enrollment period for 2018 \nplans.165 \n                                                 \n162  CMS, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Market Stabilization, 82 Fed.

HHS has claimed that shortening the open enrollment period will reduce adverse \nselection. 82 Fed. Reg. at 18,353-54. However, HHS has not cited any evidence to show that \nprior open enrollment periods enabled adverse selection, or that shortening the period will reduce \nit. Indeed, experts have found weekly enrollment data inconclusive as to “whether longer \nenrollment windows increase risk for health insurers through adverse selection or decrease risk \nby providing greater opportunities for enrollment by so-called ‘healthy procrastinators.’”166 Still, \nthese experts concluded that “reducing the length of the open enrollment period in 2018 may \ncause as much or more harm for consumers (e.g., reduced plan switching among re-enrollees, \nlower enrollment among those eligible but previously uninsured) than any potential reduction in \nadverse selection for insurers.” Id. And there is broad consensus that later enrollees are, \ngenerally speaking, younger and healthier than earlier enrollees.167 \n140.  There can be no doubt that the Administration’s decision to shorten the 2018 \nenrollment period for FFEs made it more difficult for people to obtain health insurance. Unlike \nthe federal government, nine state-based exchanges opted to maintain a longer 2018 open \nenrollment period than the Administration set for HealthCare.gov.

Even after witnessing the consequences of shortening open enrollment for 2018, \nDefendants elected to do so again for 2019, to much the same effect. As detailed below, \nDefendants’ decision, combined with their cuts to funding for outreach and assistance and their \nmany other sabotage actions, caused open enrollment to decline in 2019. See infra ¶¶ 194-95. \n142.  By cutting open enrollment in half, Defendants have violated their constitutional \nobligation to take care that the ACA is faithfully executed. Rather, they have purposefully \nundermined the Act—the aim of which is to expand access to quality coverage—in at least two \nways. First, cutting open enrollment will result in fewer individuals receiving ACA-compliant \nhealth insurance coverage overall, directly undermining the Act’s goal. And second, by \ndecreasing health insurance enrollments, and in particular by decreasing enrollments among \nyounger and healthier populations, cutting open enrollment will weaken health insurance markets \nand increase premiums, ultimately resulting in even fewer individuals being able to access \naffordable health care coverage. \n2.  Cutting Funding for Advertising and Refusing to Publicize Open \nEnrollment \n143.  In keeping with the exchanges’ duty to facilitate enrollment, HHS regulations \nspecify that they “must conduct outreach and education activities . . . to educate consumers about \n                                                 \n168  Mark A.

In order to comply with this obligation for federally-facilitated exchanges, HHS \nhas, in the past, funded advertising campaigns. In 2016, for example, HHS spent $100 million on \nadvertising to educate consumers about, and promote their enrollment in, health insurance.169  \n145.  So far, President Trump and his Administration have drastically reduced funding \nfor such advertising—twice. \n146.  First, on January 26, 2017—in the waning days of that year’s open enrollment \nperiod—the Administration overruled the objections of career staff and “pull[ed] the plug on all \nObamacare outreach and advertising in the crucial final days of the 2017 enrollment season,” \ncutting funding by $5 million.170 Individuals could still sign up through the January 31, 2017 \ndeadline, but the Administration decided not to “advertis[e] that fact any longer.”171 \nSubsequently, the Office of the Inspector General at HHS determined that the Administration’s \nactions resulted in $1.1 million in unrecoupable costs.172 More importantly, the advertising cuts \nresulted in fewer enrollments—to the tune of 350,000.173 Fewer enrollments mean higher \n                                                 \n169  Timothy Jost, CMS Cuts ACA Advertising by 90 Percent Amid Other Cuts to Enrollment \nOutreach, Health Affairs Blog, Aug. 31, 2017, \nhttp://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20170901.061790/full/. \n170  Paul Demko, Trump White House Abruptly Halts Obamacare Ads, Politico, Jan. 26, 2017, \nhttp://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trump-white-house-obamacare-ads-234245. \n171  Id. \n172  HHS, Office of the Inspector General, Review of The Department of Health and Human \nServices Cancellation of Marketplace Enrollment Outreach Efforts, OEI-12-17-00290 at 5, \nhttps://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-12-17-00290.pdf. \n173  See Joshua Peck, Trump Blocked Nearly 500,000 People From Getting Coverage, Medium, \nFeb. 2, 2017, https://medium.com/get-america-covered/trumped-blocked-nearly-500-000-people-\nfrom-getting-coverage-70317eedaaa4; Charles Gaba, UPDATED: Want Evidence Trump Killing \nHC.gov Ads Hurt Enrollment?

The Administration has slashed advertising funding and emphasized digital over \ntelevision-based marketing notwithstanding that—or because—evidence known to HHS \ndemonstrates that robust advertising, and television advertising in particular, is critical to \nfulfilling the ACA’s goal of increasing enrollments in health insurance coverage.180 Indeed, \nstarting in 2015, CMS undertook randomized control trials and econometric modeling to \nmeasure the effectiveness of paid promotional activities and by 2017 concluded that paid \noutreach was responsible for 40 percent of all enrollments.181 The agency further found that \ntelevision ads were “the number one driver of enrollment.”182  \n150.  That finding aligns with a study of the effectiveness of advertising in promoting \nenrollment on Kentucky’s Exchange, which found that cuts in advertising during the 2016 open \nenrollment period led to “450,000 fewer page views . . . and 20,000 fewer unique visitors per \nweek” to Kentucky’s state-based marketplace.183  \n                                                 \n179  Id. \n180  See id. \n181  Lori Lodes, I Ran ACA Outreach Under Obama.

Studies also found that the increased volume of television advertisement during \nthe 2014 open enrollment period contributed to increased enrollment and a substantial reduction \nin the uninsured rate.184 States and exchanges that have engaged in their own marketing efforts \nsimilarly report higher enrollment and more stable insurance markets: Covered California reports \nthat its marketing investment has yielded a healthier risk pool, premiums that are 6 to 8 percent \nlower, and greater insurer participation.185 \n152.  President Trump and his Administration have not only dramatically reduced \noverall funding for advertising under the Affordable Care Act, but also have gone so far as to \nproduce ads that impugn the law and its reforms. In June 2017, HHS produced and posted 23 \nvideo testimonials “from people who said they had been ‘burdened by Obamacare,’ including \nfamilies, health care professionals and small business owners.”186 “While it’s not certain where \nthe money for the videos came from, several former health officials who worked in the Obama \nAdministration said that they suspect it came from the budget meant to promote the Affordable \nCare Act.”187 And when an individual featured in one of the videos “sat down for a recording at \n                                                 \n184  Pinar Karaca-Mandic et al., The Volume of TV Advertisements During the ACA’s First \nEnrollment Period Was Associated with Increased Insurance Coverage, Health Affairs (Apr. \n2017), https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/abs/10.1377/hlthaff.2016.1440?journalCode=hlthaff; \nSarah E.

Finally, when open enrollment for plan year 2018 began on November 1, 2017, \nneither HHS nor CMS even issued a press release, and the Twitter feeds of the agencies and of \ntheir leadership were silent, in stark contrast to the prior year’s intense push. Such silence is part \nof a pattern: as described above, through multiple changes to its own websites, HHS has \nendeavored to reduce access to information about the ACA.189 And Administration officials have \nindicated that they do not want to promote ACA-compliant plans. \n154.  These actions do not simply represent a choice to spend resources in other ways; \nthe Administration’s own statements show that they were acting to frustrate the goals of the \nACA. Underscoring this is the fact that in the very year that the Administration shortened open \nenrollment, it decreased outreach. By slashing spending on ACA advertising, producing ads \ndesigned to criticize the law, and refusing to publicize open enrollment, Defendants have \nviolated their constitutional obligation to take care that the law is faithfully executed. Rather, \nthey have purposefully undermined the Act—the aim of which is to expand access to quality \ncoverage—in at least three ways. First, the Administration’s advertising choices contradict the \nrequirements of the Act and of its implementing regulations concerning education and outreach. \n42 U.S.C. § 18031(b)(1)(a); 45 C.F.R. § 155.205(e). Second, the Administration’s advertising \nchoices are resulting in fewer individuals receiving health insurance coverage, directly \n                                                 \n188  Sam Stein, Team Trump Used Obamacare Money to Run PR Effort Against It, Daily Beast, \nJuly 20, 2017, https://www.thedailybeast.com/team-trump-used-obamacare-money-to-run-ads-\nagainst-it. \n189  See Charles S.

Cutting Funding for Navigators and Encouraging Them to Undermine the \nAct \n155.  Twice—in 2017 and 2018—the Trump Administration has drastically cut funding \nfor Navigators working in federally-facilitated exchanges. With its latest round of funding cuts, \nthe Administration has gone even further, commandeering Navigators in its sabotage agenda by \nrequiring them to compete for funding according to how enthusiastically they plan to advertise \nthe availability of non-ACA compliant coverage—i.e., according to their willingness to assist the \nAdministration in siphoning consumers away from the exchanges and convincing them to \npurchase inferior coverage. These decisions exemplify the Administration’s failure to take care \nto faithfully execute the ACA. \n156.  As explained above, the ACA requires exchanges to award grants to Navigators, \n42 U.S.C. § 18031(i), who must maintain a current understanding of available health insurance \noptions, conduct public education and awareness campaigns, help consumers understand their \nchoices, facilitate consumers’ health insurance decisions, and ensure their access to consumer \nprotections, see id. § 18031(i)(3); 45 C.F.R. §§ 155.210, 155.215. To ensure that exchanges run \nby the federal government comply with the requirement that all exchanges establish Navigator \n                                                 \n190 Ashley Semanskee et al., Individual Insurance Market Performance in Early 2018, Kaiser \nFamily Foundation (June 26, 2018), https://www.kff.org/private-insurance/issue-\nbrief/individual-insurance-market-performance-in-early-2018/ (finding that these “recent policy \nchanges,” among others, “have the potential to destabilize the individual market generally”). \n \n82 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 87 of 148\nprograms, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. §§ 18031(d)(4)(K), 18031(i)(1); 45 C.F.R. §§ 155.205(d)(1), \n155.210(a), HHS enters into cooperative agreements with Navigators.191 \n157.  In the ACA, Congress recognized the importance of expert assistance, both to \nindividuals and for the functioning of the exchanges. Navigators play vitally important roles at \nevery step, from helping consumers make informed health insurance decisions to facilitating \ntheir applications and enrollment, thereby contributing to the success of the exchanges—and of \nthe Act itself—overall. For example, one study concluded that “[t]he strongest overall predictor \nof completing the [insurance] application process was receiving assistance from a [N]avigator or \nsocial worker.”192 Additional research has documented that Hispanic and low-income individuals \ndisproportionately rely on direct assistance from Navigators and other entities when making \nhealth insurance coverage decisions.193 Other experts have established the importance of the \nbroad range of Navigators’ duties for consumers and for exchanges.194 \n                                                 \n191  See, e.g., HHS, Cooperative Agreement to Support Navigators in Federally-facilitated and \nState Partnership Marketplaces, Funding Opportunity No. CA-NAV-15-001 (Apr. 15, 2015) \nhttps://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Programs-and-Initiatives/Health-Insurance-\nMarketplaces/Downloads/Navigator_2015_FOA_FINAL_04_15_2015.pdf [hereinafter 2015 \nFOA]; see generally In-Person Assistance in the Health Insurance Marketplaces, CMS, \nhttps://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Programs-and-Initiatives/Health-Insurance-\nMarketplaces/assistance.html (describing the “FFE Navigator program”). \n192  Benjamin D.

When issuing the 2015 Funding Opportunity Announcement, HHS estimated that \nit “expect[ed] to award up to $201,000,000 over the three-year project period and up to \n$67,000,000 during the first 12-month budget period.” 2015 FOA, supra n.191, at 11. Indeed, in \n2015, HHS reported awarding $67 million in grants under the FFE Navigator program.195 And in \n2016, HHS reported issuing continuation awards totaling “over $62.5 million” under the \nprogram.196  \n159.  Until late summer 2017, final preparations were underway to fund the HHS \nNavigator program at a similar level for the 2018 open enrollment—$60 million.197  \n160.  Final preparations were also underway until late summer 2017 to allocate funding \nfor the 2018 open enrollment according to the process and criteria described in the 2015 FOA.

But at the direction of political appointees at the agency, HHS abruptly changed \ncourse. In an August 31, 2017 announcement, HHS announced an entirely “new funding \nformula”—nowhere to be found in the operative 2015 FOA, nor in the relevant statutes or \nregulations—whereby “Navigator grantees will receive funding based” solely “on their ability to \nmeet their enrollment goals during the previous year.” HHS Aug. 31, 2017 Announcement, \nsupra n.175, at 1. “For example, a grantee that achieved 100 percent of its enrollment goal for \nplan year 2017 will receive the same level of funding as last year, while a grantee that enrolled \nonly 70 percent of its enrollment goal would receive 70 percent of its previous year funding \nlevel, a reduction of 30 percent.” Id. \n162.  Although HHS announced its new funding formula one day before the then-\ncurrent budget period expired, on September 1, 2017, the agency waited almost two weeks, until \nSeptember 13, 2017, to issue notices of awards to grantees under its new funding formula. \nAccordingly, because “[e]ntities and individuals cannot serve as federally certified Navigators \nwithout receiving federal grant funding to perform Navigator duties,” 2015 FOA, supra n.191, at \n7, by delaying issuance of notices of award until September 13, 2017, HHS eliminated Navigator \nprograms in FFEs from September 2-12, 2017, further violating the ACA’s requirements.  \n                                                 \n198  Aug. 23, 2017 Memo, supra n.197, at 2. \n \n85 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 90 of 148\n163.  HHS’s 2017 funding formula resulted in a nearly 40 percent decrease in overall \nfunding for the FFE Navigator program, to about $36 million.199 Some individual Navigators \nsaw cuts as high as 92 percent.200 \n164.  The U.S. Government Accountability Office (“GAO”) found that HHS’s funding \ndecision was based on unreliable data that may not have accurately reflected the Navigator \ngroups’ performance.201 In particular, the GAO pointed to HHS’s prior acknowledgment that it \nwas impossible to accurately determine how many individuals each Navigator group enrolled, in \npart because Navigators did not consistently enter their unique identification numbers into \napplications during the 2017 open enrollment period.202 Additionally, the GAO found that HHS \nand the Navigator groups likely interpreted enrollment goals differently and that HHS’s \ninterpretation may have underrepresented Navigators’ performance. HHS interpreted the goal as \nthe number of individuals Navigators planned to enroll in ACA-compliant plans. However, at \nleast some Navigators interpreted the goal more broadly to include the array of ways that \n                                                 \n199  See Robert King, Trump Cuts Obamacare Ad Budget By 90 Percent, Washington Examiner, \nAug. 31, 2017, http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/trump-cuts-obamacare-ad-budget-by-90-\npercent/article/2633128; Press Release, CMS, CMS Announces New Funding Opportunity \nAnnouncement for the Federally-Facilitated Exchange Navigator Program (July 10, 2018), \nhttps://www.cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/Press-releases/2018-Press-releases-\nitems/2018-07-10-2.html. \n200  See Juliet Eilperin & Amy Goldstein, HHS Slashes Funding to Groups Helping ACA \nConsumers Enroll by up to 92 Percent, Washington Post, Sept. 14, 2017, \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/hhs-slashes-funding-to-some-aca-\nnavigator-groups-by-more-than-60-percent/2017/09/14/729c394c-9957-11e7-b569-\n3360011663b4_story.html?utm_term=.f7910e0bc711. \n201  GAO-18-567, Health Insurance Exchanges: HHS Should Enhance Its Oversight of Open \nEnrollment Performance, U.S. Government Accountability Office 23 (July 2018), \nhttps://www.gao.gov/assets/700/693362.pdf [hereinafter July 2018 GAO Report]. \n202  Id. at 27.  \n \n86 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 91 of 148\nNavigators assist consumers, and therefore set higher goals in 2017 than they otherwise would \nhave, resulting in a decrease in their 2018 funding. \n165.  But HHS’s 2017 cuts to Navigator funding pale in comparison to those the agency \nannounced in 2018. On July 10, 2018, HHS released a new funding opportunity announcement \nfor the FFE Navigator program and stated that it “expect[ed] to award up to $10 million”203—\nmerely one-fourth the amount of funding provided for the prior year, and one-sixth the amount of \nfunding provided for the year before that. Notwithstanding Navigators’ important place in the \nACA’s statutory scheme and their vital role in facilitating enrollment, HHS has unlawfully \narrogated to itself the authority to decide that their services are no longer important.204 \n166.  Yet drastically reducing Navigator funding in FFEs was not enough. HHS also \ninstructed applicants to compete for the limited funding available by “demonstrat[ing] how they \nprovide information to people who may be unaware of the range of available coverage options in \naddition to qualified health plans . . . such as association health plans, short-term, limited-\nduration insurance, and health reimbursement arrangements.”205 This means that Navigators now \nuse funds that Congress designated to support the ACA for the opposite purpose—to undermine \nit. The Act is clear: Navigators must “conduct public education activities to raise awareness of \nthe availability of qualified health plans,” “distribute fair and impartial information concerning \nenrollment in qualified health plans,” and “facilitate enrollment in qualified health plans.” 42 \nU.S.C. § 18031(i)(3) (emphasis added). HHS’s decision to incentivize Navigators to push plans \n                                                 \n203  CMS, Press Release, CMS Announces New Funding Opportunity Announcement for the \nFederally-Facilitated Exchange Navigator Program (July 10, 2018), \nhttps://www.cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/Press-releases/2018-Press-releases-\nitems/2018-07-10-2.html.  \n204  See id. \n205  Id. \n87 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 92 of 148\ndesigned to siphon consumers away from ACA exchanges, thus weakening them, does not \nfaithfully implement the ACA but rather undermines it. \n167.  By slashing funding for Navigators and encouraging them to advertise non-ACA \ncompliant plans, Defendants have violated their constitutional obligation to take care that the \nACA is faithfully executed. Rather, they have purposefully undermined the Act—the aim of \nwhich is to expand access to quality coverage—in at least two ways. First, reducing funding for \nNavigators will result in fewer individuals receiving ACA-compliant health insurance coverage \noverall, directly undermining the Act’s goal. And second, by decreasing health insurance \nenrollments, reducing funding for Navigators will weaken health insurance markets and increase \npremiums, ultimately resulting in even fewer individuals being able to access affordable health \ncare coverage. \n4.  Failing to Set Numeric Enrollment Targets for 2018 and 2019 \n168.  In 2017, HHS declined to establish enrollment targets for the 2018 open \nenrollment period. In prior years, HHS set overall and regional numeric targets in order to \nmonitor enrollment progress during open enrollment, and focus and revise outreach efforts.206 \nThe GAO found that failing to set enrollment targets for 2018 hampered HHS’s ability to \nmeasure its performance and make critical decisions about how to use resources to facilitate \nenrollment.207 \n169.  Despite the GAO’s finding, and explicit recommendation that HHS resume the \npractice of setting numeric enrollment targets, HHS again failed to set any enrollment targets for \nthe 2019 open enrollment period. \n                                                 \n206  July 2018 GAO Report, supra n.201, at 37. \n207  Id.  \n88 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 93 of 148\n170.  By failing to set enrollment targets for HealthCare.gov, Defendants have violated \ntheir constitutional obligation to take care that the ACA is faithfully executed. Rather, they have \npurposefully undermined the Act—the aim of which is to expand access to quality coverage—by \nfailing to track enrollment progress and target outreach activities during open enrollment periods.  \n5.  Refusing to Participate in Enrollment Events and Other Outreach \n171.  To effectuate the ACA’s education and outreach mandates, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \n§ 18031(b)(1)(a); see also 45 C.F.R. § 155.205(e), in prior years HHS officials participated in \nenrollment events around the country.208 That changed dramatically in 2017. During that \nsummer, the Trump Administration ended contracts that provided outreach, and that brought \nenrollment assistance to libraries, businesses, and urban neighborhoods, in 18 cities.209 The \nAdministration stopped coordinating enrollment efforts with the Latino Affordable Care Act \nCoalition, a group of local and national organizations that assisted with every previous open \nenrollment period,210 and a number of other organizations as well.211 The Administration stopped \nsending staff to regional enrollment events.212 After being informed that HHS would no longer \n                                                 \n208  Kate Nocera & Paul McLeod, The Trump Administration Is Pulling Out Of Obamacare \nEnrollment Events, Buzzfeed, Sept. 27, 2017, https://www.buzzfeed.com/katenocera/the-trump-\nadministration-wont-support-state-obamacare. \n209  Carla K.

By cutting back on enrollment events and other outreach, Defendants have \nviolated their constitutional obligation to take care that the ACA is faithfully executed. Rather, \nthey have purposefully undermined the Act—the aim of which is to expand access to quality \ncoverage—in at least two ways. First, cutting back on enrollment events and outreach will result \nin fewer individuals receiving ACA-compliant health insurance coverage overall, directly \nundermining the Act’s goal. And second, by decreasing health insurance enrollments, cutting \nback on enrollment events and outreach will weaken health insurance markets and increase \npremiums, ultimately resulting in even fewer individuals being able to access affordable health \ncare coverage. \n  Arbitrarily Driving Up Premiums \n173.  On January 17, 2019, Defendant CMS released a proposed 2020 Notice of Benefit \nand Payment Parameters. See CMS, Proposed Rule, Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters \nfor 2020, -- Fed. Reg. -- (Jan. 17, 2019), https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-\n                                                 \nhttps://www.buzzfeed.com/katenocera/the-trump-administration-wont-support-state-obamacare \n(further reporting about an HHS official’s email to an event sponsor stating that he would not be \npermitted to participate). \n213  See id.  \n214  Id.; see, e.g., Carla K.

Like its 2019 \ncounterpart, the 2020 Proposed Rule makes certain regulatory changes to the functioning of the \nmarketplaces and the enrollment process. While the 2020 Proposed Rule has not been finalized, \nand therefore has no legal effect, it corroborates Defendants’ intent to unlawfully sabotage the \nAffordable Care Act. \n174.  In particular, the 2020 Proposed Rule would increase net premiums for almost all \nsubsidized consumers and will increase the maximum out-of-pocket limit, which also applies to \nemployer plans. The proposed rule would make a technical change to the “Premium Adjustment \nPercentage,” which is how the share of income subsidized consumers have to pay toward \nbenchmark coverage is calculated. That change would result in a family of four with income of \n$80,000 paying about $200 more per year. As the 2020 Proposed Rule admits, “[t]he proposed \nchange could also contribute to a decline in Exchange enrollment among premium tax credit \neligible consumers, and could ultimately result in net premium increases for enrollees that \nremain in the individual market, both on and off the Exchanges, as healthier enrollees elect not to \npurchase Exchange coverage.” Id. at 206.215 \n175.  Nothing requires Defendants to make this change to the formula. It is, instead, a \npurely voluntary decision to raise premiums for millions of moderate-income marketplace \nconsumers and to increase out-of-pocket costs for consumers, including those with employer \ncoverage, who have the most serious health needs. It therefore provides further evidence of \n                                                 \n215  See Katie Keith, The 2020 Proposed Payment Notice Part 1: Insurer and Exchange \nProvisions, Health Affairs, Jan. 18, 2019, \nhttps://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20190118.312754/full/ (“Early analysis of this \npart of the rule suggests it would result in higher premiums for at least 7.3 million exchange \nconsumers by cutting their premium tax credits.”). \n91 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 96 of 148\nDefendants’ intent to arbitrarily raise premiums and the uninsured rate, in an effort to sabotage \nthe ACA. \n176.  The 2020 Proposed Rule would also make it more difficult for individuals to \nenroll in ACA-compliant plans in several ways. For example, it would permit federally-\nfacilitated SHOPS to eliminate toll-free call centers, id. at 133; allow Navigators to scale back \nassistance with multiple topics, including “understanding basic concepts and rights related to \nhealth coverage and how to use it,” see id. at 135 & n.84; and clarify the rules to permit web \nbrokers to display ACA-compliant health plans and non-ACA-compliant plans on separate \nwebsites, id. at 169.  \n  Refusing to Defend the Act \n177.  Finally, Defendants have abdicated their constitutional duty to defend the ACA in \ncourt. “[T]he question of the executive’s obligation to enforce and defend implicates Article II’s \nrequirement that the president ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.’” Daniel J. \nMeltzer, Executive Defense of Congressional Acts, 61 Duke L.J. 1183, 1192 (2012). Indeed,  \na range of considerations, including the distinctive capacities of the executive \nbranch, the nature of relations between career lawyers and political appointees in \nthe government, the virtues of institutional continuity within the executive branch, \nand the relationship between the executive branch and Congress, reinforce the \nwisdom of the conventional practice of providing a defense even of statutes that \nthe incumbent administration views as offensive and possibly invalid. \n \nId. at 1186-87. \n178.  On June 7, 2018, the Attorney General notified Congress that the Department of \nJustice would “not defend the constitutionality” of the ACA’s individual mandate provision, and \nwould “argue that certain provisions of the [ACA] are inseverable from that provision,” namely \nthe guaranteed-issue and community-rating provisions, in a pending case in federal district court \n92 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 97 of 148\nin Texas.216 He did so despite acknowledging that “the Executive Branch has a longstanding \ntradition of defending the constitutionality of duly enacted statutes if reasonable arguments can \nbe made in their defense.”217 The Attorney General’s decision constituted “a dramatic break from \nthe executive branch’s tradition of arguing to uphold existing statutes and a land mine for health \ninsurance changes the ACA brought about.”218 \n179.  The Attorney General’s decision deprives the courts of the federal government’s \nconsiderable expertise and experience regarding the ACA, and inhibits the proper functioning of \nour adversary system, which is essential to ensuring that courts receive a robust presentation of \ncompeting views. More troublingly, it is a dramatic example of how Defendants are eager to \ninvalidate, rather than to implement, core ACA provisions. Because of Defendants’ decision, \nconsumers and other stakeholders cannot fully rely on the ACA’s guaranteed-issue and \ncommunity-rating provisions, which are essential to ensuring that individuals with preexisting \nconditions can obtain necessary insurance coverage. \n180.  On December 14, 2018—a day before the conclusion of open enrollment in \nfederally-facilitated exchanges—the court in the Texas litigation issued a declaratory judgment \nstriking down the entire Affordable Care Act, reasoning that the individual mandate is \nunconstitutional and is inseverable from the rest of the law. That ruling is currently stayed \npending appeal. \n                                                 \n216  Letter from Jefferson B.

Although the ACA has proven more resilient than Defendants might have hoped, \nDefendants’ actions are taking a toll. Through all the mechanisms described above, Defendants’ \nactions are aimed at weakening insurance markets; they are making it harder and more expensive \nfor consumers and small businesses to procure health insurance coverage; and they are driving \nup the size of the uninsured and underinsured populations. Local governments and individuals \nnationwide, including Plaintiffs in this case, are paying the price. \nI.  Defendants’ Unlawful Actions Are Causing Premiums to Rise and the Rate of the \nUninsured to Increase \n182.  The myriad ways in which Defendants’ actions cause premiums to rise, \nenrollment in ACA exchanges to drop, and the rate of the uninsured to increase, are described \nabove, action by action. As detailed below, the overall consequences are being felt now and, \nwithout intervention, will worsen. \n183.  In 2017 and 2018, the executive actions at issue here made it harder for \nAmericans to afford and purchase quality health insurance, in part by causing premiums for \nplans on the ACA exchanges to be higher than they would otherwise be if Defendants had \nfaithfully implemented the ACA. According to one analysis, “absent” various “policy changes,” \nincluding the actions challenged here, “it is likely that insurers would generally have required \nonly modest premium increases” from 2017 to 2018, and from 2018 to 2019 “as well.”219  \n184.  As a result of Defendants’ actions and other factors, however, premiums \nincreased substantially in 2018. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the average \n                                                 \n219  Cynthia Cox et al., Individual Insurance Market Performance in 2017, Kaiser Family \nFoundation (May 17, 2018), https://www.kff.org/private-insurance/issue-brief/individual-\ninsurance-market-performance-in-2017/.  \n \n94 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 99 of 148\npremium for a benchmark ACA plan for 2018 was about 37 percent higher than it was in \n2017.220 One analysis concluded that “a substantial portion” of such rate increases was “due to \npolitical and regulatory factors that arose in 2017”—including the Trump Administration \ndecisions at issue here.221 Insurers have agreed: the press reported that in May 2017, “[h]ealth \ninsurers across the country [were] making plans to dramatically raise Obamacare premiums or \nexit marketplaces amid growing exasperation with the Trump [A]dministration’s erratic \nmanagement of the program and its conflicting signals about the fate of aid for low-income \nconsumers and other key issues.”222 While subsidies partially insulate some marketplace \nparticipants from increased premiums, they do nothing to protect enrollees who are not eligible \nfor subsidies, or the approximately 5 million enrollees who buy ACA-compliant plans outside \nthe marketplaces.223 \n185.  Defendants’ actions are similarly causing premiums for 2019 to be higher than \nthey would otherwise be in the absence of Defendants’ sabotage efforts. Nationwide, average \npremiums are falling from their 2018 highs by a negligible 0.3 percent to 2 percent, depending \non metal level, in 2019.224 In contrast, the Brookings Institute estimates that average premiums \n                                                 \n220  May 2018 CBO Report, supra n.9, at 2. \n221  Mark Hall, Stabilizing and Strengthening the Individual Health Insurance Market: A View \nfrom Ten States 4, USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy (July 2018), \nhttps://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Stabilizing-and-Strenghtening-the-\nIndividual-Health-Insurance-Market2.pdf; see also May 2018 CBO Report, supra n.9, at 2. \n222  See, e.g., Noam N.

Defendants’ attacks on the enrollment process also caused premiums to be higher \nthan they otherwise would be in 2019. In particular, Defendants “slashing the marketing budget \nby 90 percent and gouging the outreach-assistance budget by 40 percent” worked to “siphon off \nhealthy enrollees, damaging the A.C.A. ‘risk pool,’ so that its customers tend to be sicker and \nmore expensive to carriers.”236 During open enrollment, “just 1 in 4 Americans who buy their \nown health insurance or are uninsured [were] aware that the deadline for enrolling in coverage \n[was] Dec. 15,” and “barely 1 in 4 respondents reported seeing advertisements explaining how to \nenroll in Obamacare coverage.”237 Moreover, Navigators and other outreach groups were forced \nto “focus[] their limited budgets on re-enrolling existing clients rather than trying to reach new \ncustomers.”238 \n189.  To the extent that premiums have decreased slightly from 2018 to 2019, those \ndecreases are in spite of, rather than because of, Defendants’ actions.

Moreover, the Kaiser Family \nFoundation has concluded that “premium increases in 2018 were in large part compensating for \npolicy uncertainty and the termination of cost-sharing subsidy payments.”239 However, “[l]ow \nloss ratios and higher margins indicate that some insurers over-corrected in 2018,” meaning that \ninsurers had less flexibility to increase premiums in 2019, and in fact faced pressure to lower \npremiums.240 The Brookings Institution also found that “many insurers expected policy changes \nthat are now scheduled to take effect in 2019,” which “may have led insurers to incorporate those \npolicy changes into their premiums a year early.”241 \n190.  Those increased premiums and the other ramifications of Defendants’ sabotage \nactions—like making enrollment more difficult—have, in turn, led to an increase in the rate of \nthe uninsured and underinsured.242 Recently released 2017 Census data shows that, for the first \ntime in the four years since the implementation of the ACA, the uninsured rate remained the \n                                                 \n239  Rachel Fehr et al., Individual Insurance Market Performance in Mid-2018, Kaiser Family \nFound.

See, e.g., supra ¶ 40 (citing CMS’s statement); KFF \nKey Facts, supra n.18 (“Even under the ACA, many uninsured people cite the high cost of \ninsurance as the main reason they lack coverage. In 2016, 45% of uninsured adults said that they \nremained uninsured because the cost of coverage was too high.”); M. Susan Marquis et al., \nConsumer Decision Making In The Individual Health Insurance Market, Health Affairs \n(May/June 2006), https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.25.w226 (“Affordability \nof insurance is believed to be the most important reason that the uninsured lack coverage . . . .”). \n \n99 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 104 of 148\nsame (8.8 percent) from 2016 to 2017 rather than falling significantly.243 The overall decline in \nenrollment in ACA-compliant plans from its 2016 peak, particularly among those not eligible for \nsubsidies, is contributing to this trend.244 “After peaking in 2016 at 12.7 million, there was an \napproximately 3.9% decline in ACA marketplace insurance enrollment in 2017” nationwide.245 \n2017’s “sabotage efforts likely prevented additional coverage gains by creating barriers to \nobtaining available and affordable coverage.”246 \n191.  Moreover, multiple estimates and preliminary information for 2018 suggest the \nuninsured rate is now climbing, rolling back the gains made by the Affordable Care Act when it \nwas faithfully implemented. A recent Gallup survey found that the uninsured rate in 2018 was \n13.7 percent, up from 12.2 percent in 2017.247 That level “is the highest in more than four \nyears”—i.e., the highest since the implementation of the individual mandate in 2014, and higher \n                                                 \n243  Matt Broaddus, Census: Health Coverage Progress Stalled, Center on Budget & Policy \nPriorities (Sept. 12, 2018), https://www.cbpp.org/blog/census-health-coverage-progress-stalled \n[hereinafter Census: Health Coverage Progress Stalled]. \n244  Press Release, CMS, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Releases Reports on the \nPerformance of the Exchanges and Individual Health Insurance Market (July 2, 2018), \nhttps://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/centers-medicare-and-medicaid-services-\nreleases-reports-performance-exchanges-and-individual-health; see also May 2018 CBO Report, \nsupra n.9, at 1, 5 (reporting that for 2018, a monthly average of about 9 million people under age \n65 will be insured through nongroup plans purchased on ACA exchanges, a decline from 2017, \nwhen the estimated monthly average was 10 million); Ashley Semanskee et al., Data Note: \nChanges in Enrollment in the Individual Health Insurance Market 3, Kaiser Family Found.

Similarly, the Commonwealth Fund found that the uninsured rate among \nworking-age people had risen to 15.5 percent by March 2018, up from 12.7 percent as of April \n2016—meaning that about 4 million working-age people lost insurance coverage.250 That study, \ntoo, found that the Trump Administration’s actions are responsible for these drops: the Trump \n“[A]dministration’s deep cuts in advertising and outreach during the marketplace open-\nenrollment periods, a shorter open enrollment period, and other actions that collectively may \nhave left people with a general sense of confusion about the status of the law” or dissuaded \nenrollment.251 Indeed, from 2017 to 2018, enrollment on exchanges dropped by an additional 3.7 \npercent overall, and by 5.3 percent in states with federally-facilitated exchanges.252 \n                                                 \n248  Id. \n249  Id. \n250  Sara R.

The Congressional Budget Office (“CBO”) has also estimated that the number of \nuninsured Americans under age 65 rose from 27 million in a 2016 study to 29 million in a 2018 \nstudy.253 Looking forward, the CBO projected that, between 2018 and 2019, the number of \npeople enrolled in health insurance through the nongroup market—including plans purchased on \nACA exchanges and otherwise—will decrease by 3 million, in part because “premiums faced by \npeople who are ineligible for subsidies in the nongroup market will be higher.”254  \n194.  Defendants’ actions are already driving up the uninsured rate for 2019. Because \nDefendants’ actions have made it costlier and more difficult to obtain health insurance, fewer \nindividuals enrolled in ACA-compliant health plans during open enrollment for 2019 plans than \nwould have otherwise. Given that nationwide premiums generally remained flat, and consumers \nremained interested in obtaining affordable health insurance, analysts expected that open \nenrollment would hold steady or increase. The opposite happened: 2019 open enrollment fell \nshort of 2018 enrollment “by about 4.2%, or 367,000 people.”255 More distressingly, open \nenrollment for new enrollees—which are typically more sensitive to changes to the open \nenrollment process and outreach—fell by 18.7 percent. Better retention numbers for prior \nenrollees likely kept open enrollment from becoming an outright disaster.  \n195.  A number of the sabotage efforts described above contributed to weaker than \nexpected open enrollment in 2019. That should be no surprise: after all, Defendants cut outreach \n                                                 \n253  See Congressional Budget Office, Federal Subsidies for Health Insurance Coverage for \nPeople Under Age 65: 2016 to 2026 at 2 (March 2016), \nhttps://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/114th-congress-2015-2016/reports/51385-\nhealthinsurancebaselineonecol.pdf; May 2018 CBO Report, supra n.9, at 1, 5. \n254  May 2018 CBO Report, supra n.9, at 5, 14. \n255  Shelby Livingston, HealthCare.gov Sign-Ups Come Up Nearly 400,000 Short, Modern \nHealthcare (Dec. 19, 2018), \nhttps://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20181219/NEWS/181219883 [hereinafter \nHealthCare.gov Sign-Ups]. \n102 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 107 of 148\nby 90 percent; Administration officials refused to promote open enrollment; Defendants cut in-\nperson assistance to enrollees by 80 percent; Defendants expanded and promoted non-ACA \ncompliant short-term, limited-duration insurance plans as an alternative to ACA-compliant plans; \nDefendants again shortened open enrollment to six weeks; and Defendants refused to extend the \nDecember 15 deadline for open enrollment, despite the court’s decision in the Texas litigation \nthe day before.256 Tellingly, the number of users who called or visited HealthCare.gov declined \nby 17.8 percent from 2018 to 2019, indicating that many simply were not aware of or capable of \nusing open enrollment at all. \n196.  In sum, Defendants’ efforts to sabotage the ACA have caused, and are causing, \npremiums and uninsured rates to be higher than they otherwise would be nationwide. \nII.  Defendants’ Unlawful Actions Harm the City Plaintiffs by Forcing Them to Spend \nMore on Uncompensated Care \n197.  The City Plaintiffs—and, for that matter, many other cities and counties \nnationwide—are being harmed by Defendants’ unlawful attempts to undermine the ACA, and \nthey will continue to be harmed as long as Defendants’ unlawful actions stand.

Fulfilling their responsibility to care for their residents, local governments often \nprovide a variety of health services to those who, lacking adequate health insurance, cannot \notherwise pay for medical treatment. For that reason, “local governments (municipalities, \ncounties, and special-purpose health or hospital districts) bear a large share of the direct \nfinancing of public hospital and clinic services.”257 In 2013, state and local governments spent \n$19.8 billion to cover the costs of uncompensated care.258 As a result, an increase in “the number \nof uninsured and the amount of uncompensated care . . . will translate into increased pressure on \nstate and local government to finance the growing cost of the uninsured.”259  \n199.  Moreover, “compared to the insured population, the uninsured are more likely to \nskip or postpone needed care due to cost, miss preventative care, and be diagnosed with cancer at \nlater stages resulting in earlier death.”260 Then, “when uninsured persons do use services, they \n                                                 \n257  Institute of Medicine, A Shared Destiny: Community Effects of Uninsurance 128 (2003), \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK221329/ [hereinafter IOM Shared Destiny]. \n258  Patrick Kaiser & Eric Cochling, Increasing Access to Quality Healthcare for Low-Income \nUninsured Georgians Policy Recommendations for the State of Georgia 12, Georgia Center for \nOpportunity (June 2014), https://georgiaopportunity.org/assets/2014/06/Charity-Care-Report.pdf. \n259  John Holahan & Bowen Garnett, The Cost of Uncompensated Care With and Without Health \nReform 4, Urban Institute (Mar. 2010), \nhttps://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/28431/412045-The-Cost-of-\nUncompensated-Care-with-and-without-Health-Reform.PDF; see also Erin F.

Costs like these—costs institutions bear as a result of providing uncompensated \ncare—motivated the passage of the ACA. In the Act itself, Congress observed the astronomical \ncosts “of providing uncompensated care to the uninsured”: “$43,000,000,000 in 2008.” 42 \nU.S.C. § 18091(2)(F). Congress also noted that individuals who choose “to forego health \ninsurance coverage and attempt to self-insure . . . increase[] financial risks to households and \nmedical providers.” Id. § 18091(2)(A). Indeed, during the debates over the Act, members of \nCongress frequently referred to the need to reduce the costs that providers face because of \nuncompensated care.263 And in explaining his Administration’s health care reform agenda in a \nspeech to the U.S. Conference of Mayors in 2009, President Obama highlighted the need for \naction because, among other things, “spiraling health care costs” were “straining budgets across \n                                                 \n261  IOM Shared Destiny, supra n.257, at 125. \n262  Cf.

The City Plaintiffs operate or subsidize free or reduced-cost health care centers \nand clinics, which “have patients who are primarily uninsured, rely on volunteers and resources \nof the community, and face persistent financial struggles.”265 “The primary reason for using a \nfree clinic is lack of insurance.”266 For example, one study found that nearly 50 percent of the \nindividuals who use publicly funded sexually transmitted infection clinics are uninsured.267 \nSimilarly, uninsured individuals primarily rely on free or reduced-cost immunization clinics to \nobtain necessary vaccinations.268  \n202.  The City Plaintiffs will have to bear greater costs to maintain their health care \ncenters and clinics if the number of uninsured or underinsured individuals increases.

In states that expanded Medicaid, for \nexample, “[t]here was a substantial decrease in uninsured community health center visits and a \nsignificant increase in Medicaid-covered visits” relative to states that did not.269 But “[d]espite \nthe uninsured rate dipping to 9.1 percent in 2015, a record low in the U.S., there has been a slow \ntrend upward” as a result of Defendants’ unlawful actions “that has many clinic leaders \nworried—and fighting for funding.”270 \n203.  The City Plaintiffs also operate or subsidize ambulance services, which answer \nemergency calls regardless of whether the individual needing care has health insurance. Studies \nhave shown that “the uninsured . . . disproportionately rely on ambulance service for transport to \nthe [emergency department].”271 As the number of uninsured or underinsured individuals \nincreases, ambulance services will have to respond to a larger number of calls for which they \ncannot seek reimbursement from insurers. Thus, the ambulance service and, by extension, the \ncity that runs or subsidizes the service, is left to absorb the increased costs. \n                                                 \n269  Heather Angier et al., An Early Look at Rates of Uninsured Safety Net Clinic Visits After the \nAffordable Care Act, 13 Annals of Family Med. 10, 10 (Jan.-Feb. 2015), \nhttps://www.annemergmed.com/article/S0196-0644(10)00384-7/fulltext. \n270  Joseph Jaafari, The Demand for Volunteer Physicians Is Rising.

The City Plaintiffs must address these budgetary shortfalls, and must do so in \nways that impose still greater costs on cities and their residents. “Public subsidy of \nuncompensated care delivered to uninsured persons requires that additional public revenues be \nraised, resulting in a higher tax burden at the local level, the receipt of monies from federal \ncoffers, or the diversion of resources from other public purposes.”272 An unexpected increase in \nthe rate of uninsured or underinsured individuals therefore translates to additional strain on \nalready overburdened city budgets and overtaxed city residents. \n205.  Aside from the direct impact on their public safety and health departments, the \nCity Plaintiffs will have to confront the many downstream effects of a population that is \nnecessarily sicker, less productive, and less able to participate in the community and civic life. \nMultiple studies have shown that “in areas with many uninsured people, the quality of care was \nlower, as well,” in part because “it is difficult for health providers to maintain services in areas \nwith large numbers of patients who cannot pay for care.”273 More broadly, “[f]or the \ncommunities in which uninsured individuals and families live, the lack or loss of health \ninsurance coverage by some may undermine the shared economic and social foundations of the \nentire community.”274 \n206.  The effects will be felt throughout the City Plaintiffs’ budgets. As one mayor has \nput it, “if people don’t get the medical care they need, it’s going to be city fire departments and \n                                                 \n272  IOM Shared Destiny, supra n.257, at 123. \n273   Julie Rovner, Millions More Uninsured Could Impact Health of Those With Insurance, Too, \nKaiser Health News, July 14, 2018, https://khn.org/news/millions-more-uninsured-could-impact-\nhealth-of-those-with-insurance-too/. \n274   IOM Shared Destiny, supra n.257, at 120.  \n \n108 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 113 of 148\npolice departments responding to preventable emergencies.”275 Public school teachers will have \nto deal with students that either miss school or come to school and spread illnesses to other \nstudents.276 And other social services departments will face increased demand for public benefits.  \n207.  The City Plaintiffs’ economies will suffer too: “An increasing or high uninsured \nrate, and the attendant high public costs, may discourage employers from locating or continuing \nto make their home in a community.”277 Moreover, “the uneven availability of workplace health \nbenefits keeps workers ‘locked in’ to their jobs if they already have coverage through their \nemployer,” inhibiting growth and dynamism in the City Plaintiffs’ economies.278 For example, \nemployees may be unwilling to move to a new job or start a new business, and thereby forego \nemployer-provided health insurance, if doing so forces them to purchase costly insurance on the \nindividual market. \n208.  All of these costs—budgetary, economic, political, and social—are being borne \nby each of the City Plaintiffs in this case. \n  Columbus, Ohio \n209.

To start, Columbus has a public health department, Columbus Public Health, \nwhich “is charged with assuring conditions in which people can be healthy.” Columbus Public \nHealth “is made up of a range of programs providing clinical, environmental, health promotion, \nand population-based services,”279 and has an annual budget of approximately $56 million and is \nstaffed by 490 full- and part-time employees. \n211.  Columbus Public Health subsidizes a number of community health centers that, as \ndescribed above, will face greater demand from uninsured or underinsured individuals who \ncannot obtain health care elsewhere. In 2017, these community health centers saw over 22,000 \npatients, including over 11,000 uninsured patients—a 7 percent increase in the percentage of \nuninsured patients from 2016. Through August of 2018, the centers had already seen 9,423 \nuninsured patients out of 16,163 patients in all, which would amount to an 8 percent increase if \nthe same number holds over the course of the year. In total, these centers have an annual budget \nof approximately $38 million.  \n212.  Most importantly, Columbus Public Health financially supports PrimaryOne \nHealth, which is a collection of ten Columbus neighborhood health centers in medically \nunderserved areas.280 PrimaryOne is designed to be a “system of health center sites throughout \n                                                 \n279  About Columbus Public Health, City of Columbus, \nhttps://www.columbus.gov/publichealth/About-Columbus-Public-Health/. \n280  The History of PrimaryOne Health, PrimaryOne, http://www.primaryonehealth.org/about/.  \n \n110 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 115 of 148\nColumbus and Franklin County to serve the health care needs of vulnerable, un/under and \ninsured residents within the community.”281 \n213.  In 2017, Columbus subsidized PrimaryOne with $4,367,145 in public funds. That \nsame year, the centers served over 45,000 patients. This included more than 15,000 uninsured \npatients, an increase of almost 3,000 more uninsured patients than the year before. In contrast, \nthe number of uninsured patients dropped from 17,752 in 2013 to 14,272 in 2014, after the \nindividual mandate took effect.  \n214.  If the rate of uninsured or underinsured individuals increases, then the \nPrimaryOne Health centers will necessarily see even more patients, and Columbus will either \nhave to provide them with additional funding or let them decrease the range of services they are \nable to provide. See supra ¶ 202.  \n215.  Columbus Public Health also operates a number of specialty clinics for alcohol \nand drug abuse prevention, dental services, family planning, immunizations, sexual health, \ntuberculosis control, women, infants, and children nutrition, and women’s health and wellness.282 \nEach of these clinics operates on a free or reduced-fee scale and principally serves the uninsured \nand underinsured populations.283 As with PrimaryOne Health, growth in the uninsured and \nunderinsured population will translate to additional costs for Columbus. \n216.  Columbus also maintains “one of the best Emergency Medical Services (EMS) in \nthe United States,” operated by the Columbus Division of Fire.284 That system dispatches \n                                                 \n281  Id. \n282  About Columbus Public Health, City of Columbus, \nhttps://www.columbus.gov/publichealth/About-Columbus-Public-Health/. \n283  See, e.g., Dental Clinic, City of Columbus, \nhttps://www.columbus.gov/publichealth/programs/Dental-Clinic/.  \n284  Division of Fire, City of Columbus, https://www.columbus.gov/public-\nsafety/fire/reports/EMS-Reports/. \n111 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 116 of 148\nambulances to meet urgent health needs, regardless of whether the call comes from an individual \nwho has health insurance or is otherwise able to pay for the call. In 2017, the Columbus Division \nof Fire answered over 132,000 emergency medic calls and had a budget of over $240 million. \n217.  If possible, “[r]eimbursement for the expense of emergency ambulance transport \nis sought from a patient’s Medicare, Medicaid, or commercial health insurance coverage.”285 If \nan individual “live[s] in the City of Columbus and do[es] not have health insurance coverage, \n[they] will not receive a bill for transport”; thus, “no Columbus resident will pay anything ‘out of \npocket’ as the result of being transported to a hospital by The Columbus Division of Fire.”286 \nIndeed, while Columbus recoups from 40 to 80 percent of its costs for transports for individuals \nwith private insurance, Columbus only recoups less than 4 percent of its costs for uninsured \nindividuals. For that reason, reimbursements “in no way cover all the costs incurred for treatment \nand transport.”287 \n218.  As explained above, an increase in the number of uninsured or underinsured \nindividuals will result in more transports for which Columbus does not receive reimbursement \nand thus must make up for the shortfall in its budget. See supra ¶ 203. Indeed, Columbus’s data \nshows that this concern is far from speculative: In 2014, after the individual mandate took effect, \nthe number of uninsured transports dropped from 11,123 to 7,944—a decrease of 29 percent. In \n2015, that number fell by another 18%, to 6,541 transports. Until 2018, those numbers remained \nessentially flat. However, preliminary 2018 numbers for January-July (4,157 transports) show \nthat the number of uninsured transports increased by 650 over the same timeframe in 2017 \n(3,507 transports)—an 18.5 percent increase. As the uninsured rate goes up again, Columbus can \n                                                 \n285  Id. \n286  Id. \n287  Id. \n112 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 117 of 148\nexpect to provide additional unreimbursed transports, which will be paid for out of Columbus’s \nown coffers.  \n219.  Aside from these budgetary impacts, Columbus—a city of nearly 900,000 people, \nwith an economy of $132 billion—is harmed by the need to care for a population that becomes \nincreasingly uninsured and less healthy. As explained above, an increase in the rate of uninsured \nand underinsured individuals will impose additional drains on the city’s budget and its personnel, \nand will make the city a less attractive place to live and work.  \n220.  Each of these harms is traceable to Defendants’ unlawful actions. As explained \nabove, Defendants’ actions increase the rate of the uninsured and underinsured, which in turn \naffects Columbus’s budget and diminishes Columbus’s economic prospects. CMS found that the \ncost of the lowest cost Silver plan in Ohio increased by 19.4 percent from 2017 to 2018, and by \n3.8 percent from 2018 to 2019.288 For other plans, “Ohioans who have Obamacare plans will see \npremium increases averaging 6.3 percent for health-insurance coverage in 2019, according to the \nOhio Department of Insurance.”289 The Kaiser Family Foundation found that, in 2019, after-tax \ncredit costs of plans across metal levels and income brackets are generally increasing in Franklin \nCounty.290 One analyst found that the average unsubsidized insurance premium in Ohio in 2019 \nis $649 higher than it would otherwise be because of Defendants’ sabotage actions.291 \n                                                 \n288  CMS, Average Monthly Premiums for Second-Lowest Cost Silver Plan and Lowest Cost Plan \nfor States Using the HealthCare.gov Platform, 2016-2019 (Oct. 11, 2018), \nhttps://www.cms.gov/sites/drupal/files/2018-10/10-11-\n18%20Average%20Monthly%20Premiums%20for%20SLCSP%20and%20LCP%202016-\n2019.pdf [hereinafter Average Monthly Premiums]. \n289  Ginger Christ, Ohio Obamacare 2019 Costs Rise, But Not as Much; More Options Available, \nCleveland Plain Dealer (Oct. 7, 2018), \nhttps://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2018/10/ohio_obamacare_2019_costs_rise.html. \n290  How ACA Marketplace Premiums Are Changing, supra n.224. \n291  The Chart that Shows the Price Tag, supra n.226.  \n \n113 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 118 of 148\n221.  The Urban Institute projects that Defendants’ sabotage efforts, among other \nfactors, will cause enrollment in ACA-compliant plans to decrease in Ohio by 31.6 percent for \n2019—45.6 percent if expanded access to short-term policies is factored in292—thus increasing \nthe rate of the uninsured and the underinsured. Indeed, 2019 open enrollment in Ohio fell by 11.1 \npercent. Moreover, Columbus tends to have a higher rate of uninsured individuals than Ohio \noverall.293 Columbus is therefore particularly vulnerable to Defendants’ attempts to sabotage the \nACA and the resulting increase in the rate of uninsured. By the same token, each of these harms \nwill be redressed by countermanding the challenged provisions of the 2019 Rule specifically and \nDefendants’ sabotage of the ACA more generally. \n  Baltimore, Maryland \n222.  The City of Baltimore, Maryland, will be harmed in many of the same ways as \nColumbus. By increasing the rate of uninsured and underinsured individuals, Defendants’ actions \nwill make it costlier for Baltimore to support its health clinics and other programs; they will \nlikewise force Baltimore to spend more to cover unrecouped costs from city ambulance calls; \nand Baltimore, too, will suffer the many harms associated with a population that is necessarily \nless healthy. \n223.  “The Baltimore City Health Department is the oldest continuously-operating \nhealth department in the United States, formed in 1793.” It is charged with “working to improve \nthe health and well-being of Baltimore residents”—and thereby “make Baltimore a city where all \n                                                 \n292  March 2018 Urban Institute Study, supra n.116, at 11. \n293  See 2017 Community Health Assessment 2-5, Columbus, Worthington, Franklin County \n(Sept. 2017), https://www.columbus.gov/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=2147499258; U.S. \nCensus Bureau, Selected Characteristics of Health Insurance Coverage in the United States, \n2017 ACA 5-Year Estimates (2017), https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml \n(select table and enter “Ohio” and “Columbus city, Ohio”) [hereinafter Selected Characteristics]. \n \n114 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 119 of 148\nresidents realize their full health potential.” To that end, the department “has a wide-ranging area \nof responsibility,” including matters like acute communicable diseases, chronic disease \nprevention, HIV/STD, maternal-child health, school health, and senior services. It is staffed by \napproximately 800 employees and has an annual budget of approximately $126 million.294 \n224.  In particular, the Baltimore City Health Department operates a number of \nspecialty clinics out of two principal facilities. These include clinics for reproductive health, \nsexually transmitted diseases, dental and oral health care, and immunizations.295 The department \nalso subsidizes a Men’s Health Center, which operates out of space provided at one of the \ndepartment’s own facilities.296 Each of these clinics provides services on a free or reduced-fee \nscale and therefore serves as an essential resource for the uninsured and underinsured \npopulations.297 Consequently, any growth in the uninsured and underinsured population will \nmean additional costs for the city. \n225.  The Baltimore City Health Department also provides or subsidizes a number of \nother services for Baltimore’s uninsured and underinsured residents. In particular, the \nDepartment funds a visiting-nurse program that makes house calls for individuals who tend to \nuse ambulance services frequently, including those with chronic health conditions like diabetes, \nhypertension, asthma, and mental health disorders. The Department also funds a number of other \nprograms focused on specific health conditions, including a Community Asthma Program, a \n                                                 \n294  About the Baltimore City Health Department, Baltimore City Health Department, \nhttps://health.baltimorecity.gov/about. \n295  Health Clinics & Services, Baltimore City Health Department, \nhttps://health.baltimorecity.gov/programs/health-clinics-services. \n296  Men’s Health Center, Baltimore City Health Department, \nhttps://health.baltimorecity.gov/health-clinics-services/mens-health-center. \n297  See, e.g., Family Planning & Reproductive Health Clinic, Baltimore City Health Department, \nhttps://health.baltimorecity.gov/health-clinics-services/family-planning-reproductive-health. \n \n115 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 120 of 148\nTuberculosis Control Program, a Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program, and programs \nfor substance abuse.298 And the Department subsidizes a number of other entities that provide \nservices to Baltimore residents, including the Baltimore Family League and Health Care Access \nMaryland. An increase in the uninsured rate will similarly impose additional burdens on each of \nthese programs, and therefore require more funding from the city. See supra ¶ 202. \n226.  Like Columbus, the Baltimore City Fire Department also maintains an ambulance \nsystem that answers calls whether or not they come from individuals with health insurance or \nwho are otherwise able to pay.299 In 2017, the Baltimore City Fire Department answered over \n100,000 emergency medic calls, with 17,000 from uninsured residents, and had a budget of over \n$42 million for emergency medical services. In 2018, the Department answered roughly the \nsame number of total calls, with 15,697 from uninsured residents. \n227.  The Baltimore City Fire Department attempts to recoup its costs for ambulance \nservices by seeking reimbursement from a patient’s Medicare, Medicaid, or commercial health \ninsurance coverage. If a patient lacks insurance, the department will seek reimbursement from \nthe patient personally, making several attempts to collect on the debt. However, the Department \nis rarely successful; while, on average, the department recoups 90 percent or more of its costs for \nambulance calls from individuals with private insurance, it only recoups less than 7 percent of its \ncosts for uninsured individuals. Thus, as with Columbus, more uninsured and underinsured \n                                                 \n298  See, e.g., Asthma, Baltimore City Health Department, \nhttps://health.baltimorecity.gov/node/454; Health Clinics & Services, Baltimore City Health \nDepartment, https://health.baltimorecity.gov/programs/health-clinics-services; Lead Poisoning, \nBaltimore City Health Department, https://health.baltimorecity.gov/lead/lead-poisoning; \nSubstance Use and Misuse, Baltimore City Health Department, \nhttps://health.baltimorecity.gov/programs/substance-abuse; Tuberculosis, Baltimore City Health \nDepartment, https://health.baltimorecity.gov/node/164. \n299  See Welcome to the Baltimore City Fire Department, Baltimore City Fire Department, \nhttps://fire.baltimorecity.gov/. \n116 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 121 of 148\nindividuals means more ambulance calls for which Baltimore does not receive reimbursement \nand thus must make up for the shortfall in its budget. See supra ¶ 203.  \n228.  Indeed, Baltimore’s ambulance system will be hit especially hard; in its recent \nstrategic plan, the Baltimore City Fire Department identified “[r]esources allocation for EMS: \nallotment of resources with increasing EMS call volume; staffing; too many calls for amount of \npersonnel we have; potential closings” as the community’s chief area of concern.300 Baltimore \nhas adopted multiple programs to try to deal with this problem, including the visiting nurse \nprogram described above, and a High Utilizer Task Force “focused on strategies to support the \nmost vulnerable patients, whose unmet social, complex medical, behavioral health, or \nenvironmental needs contribute to repetitive, avoidable use of acute health services.”301 An \nincrease in the uninsured rate will only further strain a system which is already overstretched. \n229.  Finally, Baltimore—a city of over 600,000 people, with a $187.4 billion \neconomy—is similarly harmed by the burdens imposed by a sicker population. As with \nColumbus, an increase in the uninsured rate will drain Baltimore’s budget and resources across \nthe board, and will make the city a less attractive place to live and work.  \n230.  These harms, again, can be traced directly to Defendants’ unlawful actions. \nDefendants’ actions are contributing to premiums that are much higher than they would \notherwise be in Maryland. The Kaiser Family Foundation found that, in 2019, after-tax credit \ncosts are skyrocketing for Bronze and Silver plans across income brackets in Baltimore.302 One \n                                                 \n300  Strategic Plan 2016-2021 at 9, Baltimore City Fire Department (2016), \nhttp://fire.baltimorecity.gov/sites/default/files/Baltimore%20Strategic%20Plan%202016-\n2021%20FINAL%2016%2010%2016%20corrected.pdf. \n301  High Utilizer Task Force, Baltimore City Health Department, \nhttps://health.baltimorecity.gov/high-utilizer-task-force. \n302  How ACA Marketplace Premiums Are Changing, supra n.224. \n \n117 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 122 of 148\nanalyst found that the average unsubsidized insurance premium in Maryland in 2019 is $496 \nhigher than it would otherwise be because of Defendants’ sabotage actions.303 Beyond 2019, one \nstudy describes Maryland as having a “high risk” of experiencing premium increases of up to 50 \npercent.304 Another predicts premium increases averaging 30 percent.305 \n231.  Higher premiums mean more uninsured families and individuals. Sharply rising \npremiums have already had an effect on Maryland, with enrollees on Maryland’s ACA exchange \ndropping 13 percent from 2017 to 2018.306 Looking ahead, the Urban Institute estimates a further \n20.1 percent decrease in 2019.307 Like Columbus, Baltimore has a higher uninsured rate than the \nrest of its state, meaning that Baltimore is also particularly vulnerable to an increase in the \nuninsured rate caused by Defendants’ sabotage efforts.308 And again like Columbus, Baltimore’s \nharms will be redressed by countermanding the challenged provisions of the 2019 Rule \nspecifically and Defendants’ sabotage of the ACA more generally. \n                                                 \n303  The Chart that Shows the Price Tag, supra n.226. \n304  National Analysis Projects 2019 Premium Hikes of 30 Percent in Some States and \nCumulative Increases of 90 Percent or More in the Next Three Years, Covered California (Mar. \n8, 2018), https://coveredcanews.blogspot.com/2018/03/national-analysis-projects-2019-\npremium.html [hereinafter March 2018 Covered California Post]. \n305  Rabah Kamal et al., 2019 Premium Changes on ACA Exchanges, Kaiser Family Found.

The City of Cincinnati will, like Columbus and Baltimore, be harmed by having \nto pay more to support clinics that serve the uninsured and underinsured population, to maintain \nambulance services that respond to calls from uninsured residents, and to manage an increasingly \nless healthy and less productive population.  \n233.  “Since 1826, the Cincinnati Health Department . . . has been committed to \nprotecting and improving the health of the people of Cincinnati.” The Department is “a \nnationally recognized leader in public health” that “advocates for responsive health and human \nservices that promote healthy living environments and social well-being, as well as works to \nreduce health inequities such as poverty and unemployment.”309 The Department has an annual \nbudget of approximately $51 million and is staffed by 490 employees. \n234.  The Cincinnati Health Department subsidizes a number of health centers that will, \nagain, face greater demand as the rate of uninsured and underinsured individuals increases. \nThese centers have an annual budget of $23 million. In 2017, these centers saw about 45,000 \npatients, with 95,000 individual visits. Specifically, these centers saw 13,123 uninsured \npatients—an 11 percent increase over the 2016 figure of 11,776 patients. \n235.  Most importantly, the Cincinnati Health Department operates seven freestanding \nprimary-care centers, which provide a full range of general medical services to Cincinnati’s \nuninsured residents. Cincinnati also operates nine dental centers, including one combined vision \nand dental center. The Department’s centers operate on a sliding-fee scale basis, where uninsured \n                                                 \n309  About the Health Department, City of Cincinnati, https://www.cincinnati-\noh.gov/health/about-the-health-department/. \n119 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 124 of 148\nresidents pay based on their income. Thus, an increase in the uninsured and underinsured rate \nwill mean that Cincinnati must pay more to provide care to its residents. \n236.  Aside from its free-standing health clinics, the Cincinnati Health Department \noperates thirteen School Based Health Centers, serving 10,000 students, out of Cincinnati public \nschools, which provide “physicals, asthma management, immunizations, prescription \nmedications, sick and injury care, and health education to children and families.”310 These \ncenters are available to uninsured students, and will likewise see greater demand if those students \nand their families lack health insurance coverage. \n237.  The Cincinnati Health Department also operates several other programs designed \nto improve the health of city residents. For example, the Department operates a First Steps \nProgram that provides services, including home visits, to new mothers and their infant \nchildren;311 a Men’s Health Initiative that “specializes in providing health education and linking \nservices to men who have been historically underserved”;312 and a Community Health Nursing \nProgram that provides “comprehensive nursing services” on a sliding-scale basis because “when \ncoverage stops, we don’t.”313 Each of these services, too, will cost more to run as the rate of the \nuninsured and underinsured goes up. See supra ¶ 202. \n                                                 \n310  School & Adolescent Health, City of Cincinnati, https://www.cincinnati-\noh.gov/health/cincinnati-health-department-divisions1/school-adolescent-health/. \n311  Maternal and Infant Health, City of Cincinnati, https://www.cincinnati-\noh.gov/health/cincinnati-health-department-divisions1/fetal-infant-mortality/. \n312  Men’s Health, City of Cincinnati, https://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/health/cincinnati-health-\ndepartment-divisions1/men-s-health1/. \n313  Nursing Services, City of Cincinnati, https://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/health/cincinnati-health-\ndepartment-divisions1/nursing-services/. \n \n120 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 125 of 148\n238.  Cincinnati also maintains an emergency medical services system, operated by the \nCincinnati Fire Department.314 That system dispatches ambulances to meet urgent health needs, \nregardless of whether the call comes from an individual who has health insurance or is otherwise \nable to pay for the call. In 2017, the Cincinnati Fire Department had a budget of over $60 \nmillion, and answered over 62,000 emergency medic calls. Around 34,000 of those calls resulted \nin hospital transports, and around 4,300 of those transports involved uninsured patients. Each of \nthese numbers increased from 2016 to 2017, and all else being equal will continue to increase in \n2018 because of the Trump Administration’s actions. \n239.  If a transported patient lacks insurance, Cincinnati will attempt to recoup its costs \nfrom the patient directly. However, while Cincinnati recoups between 93 percent and 94 percent \nof its billed costs from private insurers (based on rates negotiated by the city), it recoups less \nthan 3 percent of its costs from uninsured individuals. Thus, as explained above, an increase in \nthe number of uninsured or underinsured individuals will result in more transports for which \nCincinnati receives little reimbursement and thus must make up for the shortfall in its budget. \nSee supra ¶ 203.  \n240.  Setting aside these budgetary impacts, Cincinnati—a city of around 300,000 \npeople, with an economy of $132 billion—is harmed by the need to care for an increasingly \nuninsured and less healthy population. As explained above, an increase in the rate of uninsured \nand underinsured individuals will impose additional drains on Cincinnati’s budget and its \npersonnel, and will make the city a less attractive place to live and work. \n                                                 \n314  EMS Operations, City of Cincinnati, https://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/fire/operations/ems-\noperations/. \n121 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 126 of 148\n241.  Cincinnati’s harms, too, are traceable to Defendants’ unlawful actions—as \nexplained above, those actions increase the rate of the uninsured and underinsured, which in turn \naffects Cincinnati’s budget and diminishes Cincinnati’s economic prospects. As explained above, \nDefendants’ actions are causing premiums and uninsured rates in Ohio to rise. See supra ¶¶ 220-\n21. In particular, the Kaiser Family Foundation found that, in 2019, after-tax credit costs for \nplans across metal levels and income brackets are increasing, generally by double-digit \npercentages, in Hamilton County.315 Like Columbus, Cincinnati has a higher uninsured rate than \nOhio overall, and is likewise particularly vulnerable to Defendants’ attempts to sabotage the \nACA.316 Accordingly, each of these harms will also be redressed by countermanding the \nchallenged provisions of the 2019 Rule specifically and Defendants’ sabotage of the ACA more \ngenerally. \n  Chicago, Illinois \n242.  Much like Columbus, Baltimore, and Cincinnati, the City of Chicago, too, will be \nharmed by the rise in the uninsured and underinsured rate caused by Defendants’ unlawful \nactions, including by being forced to pay more to operate and subsidize the clinics that serve its \nuninsured and underinsured residents, to fund its ambulance system in the face of greater \nunrecouped costs from calls by uninsured and underinsured individuals, and to manage the \ndownstream costs of a population that is necessarily sicker and less productive. \n                                                 \n315  How ACA Marketplace Premiums Are Changing, supra n.224. \n316  See Community Health Assessment 33, City of Cincinnati, https://www.cincinnati-\noh.gov/health/assets/File/EDIT%20THIS%20CHA_12_21_17%20FINAL.pdf (last updated Dec. \n21, 2017); Selected Characteristics, supra n.293 (select table and enter “Ohio” and “Cincinnati \ncity, Ohio”). \n \n122 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 127 of 148\n243.  Chicago has a Department of Public Health that seeks to promote and improve the \nhealth of city residents. The Department has an annual budget of about $177 million and is \nstaffed by nearly 600 full-time employees.317 \n244.  The Chicago Department of Public Health operates free or reduced-cost clinics \nthat, as described above, will face greater demand from uninsured or underinsured individuals \nwho cannot obtain health care elsewhere. Specifically, the Department operates five clinics that \nprovide free vaccinations;318 five clinics that provide mental-health services at no cost for \nuninsured Chicago residents;319 and three clinics that provide free testing and treatment for \nsexually transmitted infections.320 Collectively, these clinics serve thousands of uninsured city \nresidents. \n245.  The Chicago Department of Public Health also partners with community-based \nhealth centers to offer a wide array of medical services, including for uninsured patients. These \nhealth centers operate six clinics that provide primary care as well as care directed to the needs \n                                                 \n317  City of Chicago, 2019 Budget Overview 128 \nhttps://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/obm/supp_info/2019Budget/2019BudgetOvervi\new.pdf [hereinafter 2019 Chicago Budget Overview]. \n318  Walk-In Immunization Clinics, City of Chicago, \nhttps://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdph/supp_info/health-protection/immunizations_walk-\ninclinics.html.  \n319  Mental Health Centers, City of Chicago, \nhttps://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdph/supp_info/behavioral-\nhealth/mental_health_centers.html. \n320  STI/HIV Testing and STI Treatment, City of Chicago, \nhttps://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdph/provdrs/health_services/svcs/get_yourself_eva\nluatedforstihivaids.html. \n \n123 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 128 of 148\nof women and children and two primary-care clinics for people living with HIV/AIDS.321 \nChicago provides funding for these clinics as well.322 \n246.  If the rate of uninsured or underinsured individuals increases, then the clinics \noperated by the Chicago Department of Public Health and its community-based partners will \nnecessarily have to provide free or reduced-cost care to more patients. In that event, Chicago \neither must provide the Department and its partners with more funding, or the Department and its \npartners must decrease the services that they provide. See supra ¶ 202. \n247.  The Chicago Fire Department also provides ambulance transportation services to \nits residents, including its uninsured and underinsured residents. The Department receives about \n$93 million in annual funding for emergency medical services, employing more than 800 people \nto provide those services.323 The Department’s paramedics provide ambulance-transportation \nservices approximately 250,000 times per year. \n248.  The Chicago Fire Department provides ambulance services regardless of the \npatient’s income or insurance status. Chicago generally seeks reimbursement for ambulance \nservices from the patient or, if applicable, the patient’s insurer.324 But Chicago usually does not \nreceive full reimbursement for ambulance services from its uninsured residents. In 2017, for \nexample, the Chicago Fire Department provided ambulance services to 53,326 patients for whom \nno insurance was identified. Chicago charged these patients $55,242,627 for ambulance services \n                                                 \n321  Health Services, City of Chicago, \nhttps://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdph/provdrs/health_services.html. \n322  Neighborhood Health Clinic Information 2012, City of Chicago, \nhttps://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdph/supp_info/clinical_health/neighborhood_healt\nhclinicinformation2012.html. \n323  2019 Chicago Budget Overview, supra n.317, at 121. \n324  Ambulance Bills, City of Chicago, \nhttps://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/fin/supp_info/revenue/ambulance_bills.html. \n124 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 129 of 148\nbut collected just $1,755,545—a loss of $53,487,082. These numbers increased in 2018, during \nwhich the Chicago Fire Department provided ambulance services to 60,007 patients for whom no \ninsurance was identified. Chicago charged these patients $63,717,638 for ambulance services but \ncollected just $1,028,713—a loss of $62,688,925. \n249.  As explained above, an increase in the number of uninsured or underinsured \nindividuals will result in more ambulance transports for which Chicago does not receive \nreimbursement and thus must make up for the shortfall in its budget. See supra ¶ 203. \n250.  Aside from these budgetary impacts, Chicago—a city of some 2.7 million people \nwith a gross regional product exceeding $600 billion—is, unsurprisingly, harmed by the need to \ncare for a population that is increasingly uninsured and less healthy. As explained above, an \nincrease in the rate of uninsured and underinsured individuals will impose additional drains on \nthe city’s budget and its personnel and will make the city a less attractive place to live and work. \n251.  Each of these harms is traceable to Defendants’ unlawful actions. As explained \nabove, Defendants’ actions increase the rate of the uninsured and underinsured, which in turn \naffects Chicago’s budget and diminishes Chicago’s economic prospects. CMS found that the cost \nof the lowest cost Silver plan in Illinois increased by 15.4 percent from 2017 to 2018, and by 5.6 \npercent from 2018 to 2019.325 In Cook County, the Kaiser Family Foundation found that, in \n2019, after-tax credit costs will increase for Bronze plans across income levels and for Silver \nplans for individuals making $40,000 a year.326 Another Kaiser study confirmed that a 40-year \nold making $30,000 a year in Chicago faced increased after-tax credit costs for Bronze and \n                                                 \n325  Average Monthly Premiums, supra n.288. \n326  How ACA Marketplace Premiums Are Changing, supra n.224. \n \n125 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 130 of 148\nSilver plans.327 One analyst found that the average unsubsidized insurance premium in Illinois in \n2019 is $997 higher than it would otherwise be because of Defendants’ sabotage actions.328 \nMoving forward, one study estimates that Illinois has a “high risk” of a potential 50 percent \npremium increase.329 \n252.  The Urban Institute projects that Defendants’ sabotage efforts, among other \nfactors, will cause enrollment in ACA-compliant plans to decrease in Illinois by 25 percent for \n2019—39.1 percent if expanded access to short-term policies is factored in330—thus increasing \nthe rate of the uninsured and the underinsured. Indeed, 2019 open enrollment in Illinois fell by \n6.8 percent. Because Chicago tends to have a higher rate of uninsured individuals than Illinois \noverall, Chicago is particularly exposed to Defendants’ sabotage efforts.331 Once again, each of \nthese harms will be redressed by enjoining the challenged provisions of the 2019 Rule and \nDefendants’ efforts to sabotage the ACA. \n  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania \n253.  Finally, the City of Philadelphia will be harmed in all of the same ways as the \nother City Plaintiffs by the rise in the rates of the uninsured and underinsured caused by \nDefendants’ unlawful actions: it will be forced to pay more to support public health centers that \nserve its uninsured residents, its ambulance system will face greater unrecouped costs from calls \nby uninsured and underinsured individuals, and it, too, will suffer all of the downstream costs of \na population that is necessarily sicker and less productive. \n                                                 \n327  2019 Premium Changes, supra n.305. \n328  The Chart that Shows the Price Tag, supra n.226. \n329  March 2018 Covered California Study, supra n.159. \n330  March 2018 Urban Institute Study, supra n.116, at 10. \n331  Selected Characteristics, supra n.293 (select table and enter “Illinois” and “Chicago city, \nIllinois”). \n \n126 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 131 of 148\n254.  The City of Philadelphia was the first American city to provide free hospital care \nto its poorest residents.332 The City continued that tradition by creating the Department of Public \nHealth in 1919.333 The Department’s mission is to “protect and promote the health of all \nPhiladelphians and to provide a safety net for the most vulnerable.”334 The Department has an \nannual budget of $136 million in the City General Fund in fiscal year 2018 and has a staff of \nover 1,000 employees.335 \n255.  The Department of Public Health operates eight public community health centers \nthroughout Philadelphia that will face greater demand from uninsured and underinsured \nindividuals who cannot obtain health care elsewhere. These public health centers diagnose and \ntreat chronic and acute illnesses, provide medical checkups and medications for enrolled patients, \nprenatal care, family planning and pregnancy options counseling, breastfeeding support services, \ncomprehensive pediatric care, immunizations, children’s developmental assessments, nutrition \ncounseling, flu shots, HIV/STD/STI testing, HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis, dental care, lab \ntests, referrals, and social work support.336 Philadelphia’s health centers served 69,993 patients in \n2017.337 The City’s data reflects that patient visits to health centers increased from Philadelphia’s \n                                                 \n332  About Philadelphia Department of Public Health, City of Philadelphia, \nhttps://www.phila.gov/departments/department-of-public-health/about-us/.  \n333  Id. \n334  Id.  \n335  City of Philadelphia, Mayor’s FY 2019 Operating Budget Detail, § 43, at 3, \nhttps://www.phila.gov/finance/pdfs/budgetdetail/Mayors%20FY%202019%20Operating%20Bud\nget%20Detail%20-%20Book%202.pdf [hereinafter 2019 Philadelphia Budget]. \n336  About Philadelphia Health Centers, City of Philadelphia, \nhttps://www.phila.gov/services/mental-physical-health/city-health-centers/. \n337  See 2017 Philadelphia, City of, Health Center Profile, Health Resources & Servs. Admin., \nhttps://bphc.hrsa.gov/uds/datacenter.aspx?q=d&bid=03E00360&state=PA&year=2017; 2017 \nPennsylvania Health Center Data, Health Resources & Servs. Admin., \nhttps://bphc.hrsa.gov/uds/lookalikes.aspx?q=&bid=03E00360&state=PA&year=2017 . \n \n127 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 132 of 148\nfiscal year 2015 to fiscal year 2017 by over 46,000, from 290,358 visits to 336,445 visits. To \nserve this growing population, the health centers had a budget of $68.6 million for Fiscal Year \n2018.338  \n256.  The City subsidizes the health centers with $53 million in public funds. Much of \nthat funding goes to providing care to uninsured and underinsured individuals: in fiscal year \n2017, over 40 percent of the nearly 70,000 patients seen were uninsured.339 These uninsured \npatients are charged a sliding fee scale based on income for these services, but many are unable \nto pay anything yet still receive services. \n257.  The financial effect of an increased number of uninsured people on the City’s \nhealth centers is substantial. Past experience has shown that the City’s health centers suffer fewer \nunrecouped costs as more of the City’s residents have health insurance: after Pennsylvania \nexpanded Medicaid in 2015, increasing the number of insured individuals in the state and in the \nCity, revenue for the City’s health centers grew over 15 percent from $27.1 million in 2014 to \n$31.4 million in 2015.  \n258.  If the rate of uninsured or underinsured individuals increases, then the health \ncenters will necessarily see even more uninsured patients, and Philadelphia will either have to \nprovide them with additional funding or let them decrease the range of services they are able to \nprovide. See supra ¶ 202.  \n259.  Philadelphia also maintains one of the busiest Emergency Medical Services \ndivisions in the country through the Philadelphia Fire Department.340 The Fire Department \n                                                 \n338  2019 Philadelphia Budget, supra n.335, § 43, at 6, 34, 40. \n339  See About Philadelphia Health Centers, City of Philadelphia, \nhttps://www.phila.gov/services/mental-physical-health/city-health-centers/. \n340  About the Philadelphia Fire Department, City of Philadelphia, \nhttps://www.phila.gov/departments/philadelphia-fire-department/.  \n128 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 133 of 148\ndispatches EMS in all cases where there are emergency health needs, regardless of whether the \nperson in need has health insurance or can pay for EMS services. In 2017, EMS responded to \napproximately 267,000 total incidents. Of the calls resulting in EMS transports (the only calls for \nwhich insurance information is tracked), 23,167, or approximately 8.7 percent, were from \nuninsured individuals.  \n260.  The budget for EMS in Philadelphia is approximately $75 million. In 2017, the \nCity was able to recoup 77 percent of costs for services from insured individuals. However, the \nCity was only able to recoup approximately 1% of costs for services from uninsured individuals. \nIn 2017, $23,305,367 was not recouped from EMS services provided to uninsured individuals. \n261.  As shown above, an increase in the number of uninsured or underinsured \nindividuals will result in more ambulance calls for which the City does not receive \nreimbursement. The City will have to make up for these increased costs in its budget. See supra \n¶ 203. In 2013, before the individual mandate went into effect, the number of EMS transports for \nuninsured individuals was 41,913. In 2014, these transports were down to 37,722, a decrease of \n11 percent. As the uninsured rate goes up again, Philadelphia can expect to provide additional \nunreimbursed transports, which will be paid for directly by the City. \n262.  Aside from these direct budgetary impacts, Philadelphia—a city of nearly 1.6 \nmillion people, with a regional economy of $444.9 billion—is harmed by the need to care for a \npopulation that becomes increasingly uninsured and less healthy. An increase in the rate of \nuninsured and underinsured individuals will impose additional drains on the city’s budget and its \npersonnel, and will make the city a less attractive place to live and work. \n263.  Once again, these harms are directly attributable to Defendants’ sabotage \nefforts—which have caused premiums and uninsured rates to be higher that they would \n129 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 134 of 148\notherwise be. CMS found that the cost of the lowest cost Silver plan in Pennsylvania increased \nby 12.8 percent from 2017 to 2018, and barely decreased by 2.0 percent from 2018 to 2019.341 \nThe Kaiser Family Foundation found that, in 2019, after-tax credit costs are skyrocketing for \nplans across metal levels and income brackets in Philadelphia County.342 Another Kaiser study \nconfirmed that a 40-year old making $30,000 a year would face increased after-tax credit costs \nfor Silver and Gold plans.343 One analyst found that the average unsubsidized insurance premium \nin Pennsylvania in 2019 is $500 higher than it would otherwise be because of Defendants’ \nsabotage actions.344  \n264.  The Urban Institute projects that Defendants’ sabotage efforts, among other \nfactors, will cause enrollment in ACA-compliant plans to decrease in Pennsylvania by 30.3 \npercent for 2019—43.0 percent if expanded access to short-term policies is factored in345—thus \nincreasing the rate of the uninsured and the underinsured. Indeed, 2019 open enrollment in \nPennsylvania fell by 6 percent. Moreover, Philadelphia tends to have a higher rate of uninsured \nindividuals than Pennsylvania overall.346 Like the other City Plaintiffs, Philadelphia is therefore \nparticularly vulnerable to Defendants’ attempts to sabotage the ACA and the resulting increase in \nthe rate of uninsured. Each of these harms will be redressed by countermanding the challenged \nprovisions of the 2019 Rule specifically and Defendants’ sabotage of the ACA more generally. \n                                                 \n341  Average Monthly Premiums, supra n.288. \n342  How ACA Marketplace Premiums Are Changing, supra n.224. \n343  2019 Premium Changes, supra n.305. \n344  The Chart that Shows the Price Tag, supra n.226. \n345  March 2018 Urban Institute Study, supra n.116, at 11. \n346  Selected Characteristics, supra n.293 (select table and enter “Pennsylvania” and \n“Philadelphia city, Pennsylvania”). \n130 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 135 of 148\nIII.  Defendants’ Unlawful Actions Harm the Individual Plaintiffs by Making Insurance \nCoverage Harder and More Expensive to Procure \n265.  Defendants’ unlawful actions have also harmed individuals and families, by \nmaking it harder and more expensive for them to purchase health insurance on the individual \nmarket. As explained above, Defendants’ conduct has caused premiums and deductibles to \nskyrocket nationwide, and will only drive them higher still.  \n266.  Every additional dollar that, owing to Defendants’ actions, an individual must \nspend to acquire health insurance constitutes financial harm. There can be no dispute that the \nrising cost of health insurance is a problem Congress specifically set out to address in enacting \nthe ACA. Congress specifically noted its desire to “significantly reduc[e] the number of the \nuninsured,” and thereby “lower health insurance premiums.” 42 U.S.C. § 18091(2)(F). In other \nwords, the ACA expressly “seeks to make insurance more affordable” for individuals and \nfamilies. King, 135 S. Ct. at 2487. \n267.  Since President Trump took office, however, premiums for health insurance \npurchased on the individual market have sharply increased, as described above. Charlottesville, \nVirginia, has been particularly hard hit. For the 2018 benefit year, “[m]onthly health-care \ninsurance premiums increased all over America . . . but nowhere as dramatically as in \nCharlottesville,” according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.347 “An exodus of carriers, which \nwas blamed on losses caused by the instability of the Obamacare marketplace,” and in turn \ndirectly attributable to the Trump Administration’s actions, “created a coverage vacuum, leaving \n                                                 \n347  Colby Itkowitz, Where Are the Most Expensive ACA Plans in America? Charlottesville., \nWashington Post, Nov. 16, 2017, https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/where-are-the-most-\nexpensive-aca-plans-in-america-charlottesville/2017/11/16/e1b352d8-ca27-11e7-aa96-\n54417592cf72_story.html. \n \n131 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 136 of 148\nlocals and insurance regulators scrambling.”348 As a result, monthly premiums for individuals \nand families tripled for 2018—becoming the highest in the nation.349 \n268.  Specifically, Optima Health, then the area’s only individual market insurer, \noffered plans with premiums around $2,500 to $3,000 a month for a family of four, with an \nannual deductible of around $10,000 to $15,000—meaning that a family would have to pay \nnearly $50,000 before it saw any benefit from its health insurance.350 Rising premiums and \ndeductibles forced Charlottesville residents to resort to desperate measures to afford health \ninsurance, including hiring an unnecessary employee to purchase small business insurance, \nmoving to another county, cutting their own pay, obtaining a new job, or purchasing multiple \nnon-ACA compliant plans.351 \n269.  For all the reasons described above, Defendants’ actions have caused these \nstaggering increases in the cost of health insurance, in Virginia and nationwide. The Virginia \nBureau of Insurance reported that insurers rose rates “due to the rising cost of health care but \nalso federal actions or inaction that raise costs and create uncertainty in the insurance \n                                                 \n348  Rachel Bluth, The City With the Most Expensive ACA Insurance in the U.S., Atlantic, Apr. \n24, 2018, https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/04/the-city-with-the-most-expensive-\naca-insurance-in-the-united-states/558605/. \n349  Lisa Provence, Sticker Shock: Charlottesville Health Insurance Premiums Spike to Highest in \nNation, C-Ville, Nov. 14, 2017, http://www.c-ville.com/sticker-shock-charlottesville-health-\ninsurance-premiums-spike-highest-nation/#.W1dgkdJKhyw. \n350  Robert Pear, Middle-Class Families Confront Soaring Health Insurance Costs, New York \nTimes, Nov. 16, 2017, https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/us/politics/obamacare-premiums-\nmiddle-class.html?_r=0. \n351  Colby Itkowitz, Where Are the Most Expensive ACA Plans in America?

The Urban Institute, for example, attributed a potential \n19.1 percent increase in insurance premiums in Virginia to Defendants’ policies, among other \nfactors.353 And Covered California describes Virginia as being at “high risk” for future premium \nincreases of up to 50 percent due to “ongoing federal uncertainty.”354  \n270.  Optima has also placed the blame on Defendants, justifying its 2018 rate increases \nby pointing to “marketplace changes,” including “the uncertainty in Washington, and other \ncarriers withdrawing from the market or reducing their service area.”355 Specifically, Optima’s \n2018 rate filing attributed the increases to “growing uncertainty in the marketplace, particularly \nwith respect to various aspects of the Affordable Care Act . . . that continue to remain undecided \nand unstable,” including “the effectiveness / enforceability of the individual mandate, stability of \navailable plan options in the marketplace (e.g., carriers exiting the market), unknown funding of \nthe CSR subsidies, and preliminary rate filings indicating substantial rate actions for 2018 across \nvarious marketplaces, including Virginia.”356 Optima’s then-CEO and President, Michael \n                                                 \n352  Press Release, Virginia Gov.

Other regional insurers, like CareFirst Blue Cross Blue Shield and Evergreen \nHealth, have stated that Defendants are partly responsible for these substantial premium hikes.358 \nAnd still others, like Anthem, cited Defendants’ sabotage efforts in defending their decision to \nexit the Virginia market, thus limiting choice and driving up prices for individual consumers.359 \nThese are not isolated cases: a study of insurer decisionmaking by the Urban Institute found that \nmost insurers “remain committed to participating in the individual market,” but that their \n“commitment has been tested by the continued erosion of policies designed to maintain the \nstability of the individual market.”360  \n272.  Insurers again sought to increase their rates in Virginia for 2019 by around 20 \npercent, reflecting the persistent effects of Defendants’ sabotage actions.361 However, \n                                                 \n357  Robert Pear, Middle-Class Families Confront Soaring Health Insurance Costs, New York \nTimes, Nov. 16, 2017, https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/us/politics/obamacare-premiums-\nmiddle-class.html?_r=0. \n358  Sarah Kliff, The Trump Administration Is Making Obamacare More Expensive, Vox, May 8, \n2017, https://www.vox.com/2017/5/8/15563448/trump-insurance-premiums-2018. \n359  Michael Martz, Anthem, State’s Largest Health Insurer, Drops Out of Virginia’s Individual \nMarket for 2018, Richmond Times-Dispatch, Aug. 11, 2017, \nhttps://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/anthem-state-s-largest-health-\ninsurer-drops-out-of-virginia/article_c704aecb-f84d-5602-92ce-a04b711edb30.html; Katie \nO’Connor, 58 Virginia Counties Left Without an Insurance Option in 2018 Exchanges as \nDeadline Approaches, Richmond Times-Dispatch, Sept. 13, 2017, \nhttps://www.richmond.com/life/health/virginia-counties-left-without-an-insurance-option-in-\nexchanges-as/article_2e83056f-3d2e-5a04-9967-32bcbc93ea71.html. \n360  Sabrina Corlette et al., Insurers Remaining in Affordable Care Act Markets Prepare for \nContinued Uncertainty in 2018, 2019 at 3, Urban Institute (Mar. 2018), \nhttps://www.rwjf.org/content/dam/farm/reports/issue_briefs/2018/rwjf444308. \n361  John Tozzi, Obamacare Premiums to Surge Next Year, Early Requests Show, Bloomberg, \nMay 7, 2018, https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-07/obamacare-premiums-to-\nsurge-next-year-early-rate-requests-show. \n \n134 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 139 of 148\nCharlottesville saw some relief: Anthem re-entered the Charlottesville market, and Optima \nslightly decreased its rates. That reduction, though, comes nowhere close to canceling out the \nimpact of Optima’s staggering rate increases in the past,362 and Anthem raised its statewide rates \nby 3.2 percent over 2018.363 Both Optima’s and Anthem’s rates would be lower in the absence of \nDefendants’ attempts to sabotage the ACA. Indeed, one analyst found that the average \nunsubsidized insurance premium in Virginia in 2019 is $1,078 higher than it would otherwise be \nbecause of Defendants’ sabotage actions.364 \n273.  Steve Vondra and Bonnie Morgan, a married couple who have been residents of \nCharlottesville since 2009 and 2010, respectively, have therefore been forced to pay higher \npremiums for lower-quality insurance because of Defendants’ actions. \n274.  Steve has a preexisting condition. Before the ACA, Steve’s health insurance \nsituation was precarious: he had not had health insurance since 2005, when he closed his \nbusiness. He was unable to purchase insurance because, at the time, insurers were able to \ndiscriminate against individuals on the basis of their health history and health status. While \nBonnie had insurance through her work, Steve was ineligible, as the two were not married at the \ntime. \n275.  After the ACA prohibited discrimination on the basis of preexisting conditions, \nSteve and Bonnie were finally able to purchase insurance on the individual exchange. In 2016, \nthey purchased a Bronze plan with a premium of around $1050 a month for the two of them. \n                                                 \n362  Id. \n363  Elizabeth Simpson, Anthem Re-Enters 42 Markets in Virginia’s Affordable Care Act \nExchange, Including Hampton Roads, Virginian-Pilot, Aug. 14, 2018, \nhttps://pilotonline.com/news/local/health/article_8e16e5bc-9fc5-11e8-ac8c-fbe7eea0f98c.html \n364  The Chart that Shows the Price Tag, supra n.226. \n135 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 140 of 148\nThey subsequently upgraded their coverage in 2017 to a Silver plan with a premium of around \n$1270 a month. \n276.  Defendants’ attempts to sabotage the ACA, however, have dramatically increased \nthe prices Steve and Bonnie pay for coverage. Steve and Bonnie do not receive subsidized \ncoverage (advance premium tax credits) under the Act. In 2018, Steve and Bonnie returned to a \nBronze plan, sold by Optima. However, the monthly premium rose to a staggering $3327.65 for \nthe two of them—a 261 percent increase above what they paid for a Silver plan in 2017. \nMoreover, the plan’s annual deductible, around $14,400, was also significantly higher than the \ndeductible for the plans they purchased in 2016 and 2017. Combining a year’s worth of \npremiums and the annual deductible, Steve and Bonnie would have had to spend nearly $55,000 \nbefore receiving any benefit from their insurance. \n277.  Similarly, in 2019, Steve and Bonnie are paying prices higher than they would \notherwise have to pay because of Defendants’ actions. Steve and Bonnie enrolled in a Bronze \nplan, sold by Anthem, with a premium of $1,899.49 for the two of them—and a $13,000 \ndeductible. While the plan is cheaper than the plan they purchased in 2018, it remains \nsignificantly more expensive than the plans they had in 2017 and 2016, before Defendants’ \nsabotage actions took hold. Combining a year’s worth of premiums and the annual deductible, \nSteve and Bonnie would still have to spend nearly $35,794 before receiving any benefit. Their \nplan is also more expensive than it was in 2018 by an average of 2.5 percent—an increase \nAnthem justified in its 2019 rate filing as a response to “the elimination of the individual \n136 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 141 of 148\nmandate penalty for lack of minimum essential coverage and potential movement into other \nmarkets,” namely, the non-ACA compliant plans promoted by Defendants.365 \n278.  Steve and Bonnie have therefore been injured by having to pay higher premiums \nand deductibles for their health coverage—the very injury the ACA was intended to prevent. \nThat injury is the direct result of Defendants’ ongoing attempts to sabotage the ACA, including \nthe 2019 Rule and Defendants’ other unlawful actions. And Steve and Bonnie’s injury would be \nredressed if Defendants were instead required to implement the ACA lawfully and in good faith. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCount One (Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act) \n279.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each of the foregoing allegations as \nif fully set forth herein. \n280.  The 2019 Rule is “final agency action for which there is no other adequate \nremedy in a court” and is “subject to judicial review.” 5 U.S.C. § 704; see id. § 702. \n281.  Under the Administrative Procedure Act, a “reviewing court shall . . . hold \nunlawful and set aside agency action . . . found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” Id. § 706(2)(A). \n282.  As detailed above, Defendants HHS, Secretary Azar, CMS, and Administrator \nVerma have failed to provide adequate reasons, and failed to adequately respond to comments, \nfor many provisions of the 2019 Rule, such that they are “arbitrary” and “capricious.” Id. In \naddition, as also detailed above, many provisions of the 2019 Rule violate the Affordable Care \nAct, and therefore are “not in accordance with law.” Id. Accordingly, upon application by the \n                                                 \n365  Actuarial Memorandum, HealthCare.gov, \nhttps://ratereview.healthcare.gov/files/787675_20180820VA88380IndOnOffRedactedAM.pdf.  \n137 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 44   Filed 01/25/19   Page 142 of 148\nspecified Plaintiffs, this Court must “hold unlawful and set aside” the following provisions of the \n2019 Rule: \na.  The provision depriving taxpayers of advance premium tax credits for \nfailing to reconcile credits for prior years on their tax returns without \ndirect notification of their ineligibility. See supra ¶¶ 52-56. (Columbus, \nBaltimore, Cincinnati, Chicago, Philadelphia, Individual Plaintiffs) \nb.  The provision outsourcing plan review on FFEs to states. See supra ¶¶ 57-\n63.

TRUMP, in his official \ncapacity as President of the    : \nUnited States of America, et al. \n              : \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nPresently pending and ready for resolution in this action \nfor declaratory judgment and injunctive relief is the motion to \ndismiss  the  amended  complaint  filed  by  Defendants  Donald  J. \nTrump, Alex M. Azar, II, the United States Department of Health \nand  Human  Services,  Seema  Verma,  and  the  Centers  for  Medicare \nand  Medicaid  Services.    (ECF  No.  52).    The  issues  have  been \nfully briefed, and the court now rules, no hearing being deemed \nnecessary.  Local Rule 105.6.  For the following reasons, the \nmotion to dismiss will be denied in part and granted in part. \nI.  Factual Background1 \nPlaintiffs the City of Columbus, Ohio, the Mayor and City \nCouncil  of  Baltimore,  Maryland,  the  City  of  Cincinnati,  Ohio, \nthe  City  of  Chicago,  Illinois,  and  the  City  of  Philadelphia, \n \n1 Unless otherwise noted, the facts outlined here are set \nforth in the amended complaint and construed in the light most \nfavorable to Plaintiffs. \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 2 of 67\nPennsylvania  (collectively,  the  “City  Plaintiffs”)  and  Stephen \nVondra  and  Bonnie  Morgan  (collectively,  the  “Individual \nPlaintiffs”) filed suit against Defendants Donald J. Trump, in \nhis  official  capacity  as  President  of  the  United  States  of \nAmerica,  the  United  States  Department  of  Health  and  Human \nServices (“HHS”), Alex M. Azar, II, in his official capacity as \nSecretary of HHS, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \n(“CMS”),  and  Seema  Verma,  in  her  official  capacity  as \nAdministrator of CMS, (collectively, “Defendants”).  Plaintiffs \nassert two claims: violation of the Administrative Procedure Act \n(“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 706 (Count I) and violation of the Take Care \nClause, U.S. Const. art. II, § 3 (Count II). \nCentral  to  Plaintiffs’  amended  complaint  is  the  Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act (the “ACA,” the “Act,” or the \n“Affordable Care Act”).  Plaintiffs allege that after “fail[ing] \nto  persuade  Congress  to  repeal  the  Affordable  Care  Act, \nPresident Trump and his Administration are waging a relentless \ncampaign to sabotage and, ultimately, to nullify the law.”2  (ECF \nNo. 44, ¶ 1).  Plaintiffs allege that Defendants’ strategy is \n“[to shift deceptively] the blame from their own actions to the \nAct  itself[]”  and  that  Defendants’  objective  is  “to  pressure \nCongress  to  repeal  the  Act  or,  if  that  fails,  to  achieve  de \n \n2 All citations to court documents in this opinion refer to \nCM/ECF pagination. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 3 of 67\nfacto  repeal  through  executive  action  alone.”    (Id.).  \nPlaintiffs  allege  that  Defendants’  actions  force  the  City \nPlaintiffs  “to  spend  more  on  uncompensated  care  for  their \nresidents[]” and the Individual Plaintiffs “to pay more for the \nquality health insurance coverage they need[.]”  (Id., ¶ 4). \nA.  The ACA \nIn  2010,  Congress  passed  and  President  Obama  signed  into \nlaw the Affordable Care Act “to increase the number of Americans \ncovered  by  health  insurance  and  decrease  the  cost  of  health \ncare.”  Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, \n538 (2012) (“NFIB”).  The ACA “adopts a series of interlocking \nreforms  designed  to  expand  coverage  in  the  individual  health \ninsurance  market.”    King  v.  Burwell,  135  S.Ct.  2480,  2485 \n(2015).    “Individual  health  insurance  is  insurance  that \nindividuals  purchase  themselves,  in  contrast  to,  for  example, \njoining employer-sponsored group health plans.”  (ECF No. 44, ¶ \n32).    “Prior  to  the  enactment  of  the  ACA,  individual  health \ninsurance markets were dysfunctional.”  (Id.).  The ACA “aims to \nachieve systemic improvements in the individual health insurance \nmarket  by  means  of  certain  key  reforms[.]”  (Id.,  ¶  33).  \nPlaintiffs’  amended  complaint  highlights  four  such  reforms.  \n(Id., ¶¶ 33-34). \nFirst, “Congress addressed the problem of those who cannot \nobtain  insurance  coverage  because  of  preexisting  conditions  or \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 4 of 67\nother health issues . . . through the Act’s ‘guaranteed-issue’ \nand ‘community rating’ provisions.”  NFIB, 567 U.S. at 547-48.  \n“These  provisions  together  prohibit  insurance  companies  from \ndenying  coverage  to  those  with  such  conditions  or  charging \nunhealthy individuals higher premiums than healthy individuals.”  \nId. at 548 (citing 42 U.S.C. §§ 300gg, 300gg-1, 300gg-3, 300gg-\n4). \nSecond,  recognizing  that  “[t]he  guaranteed-issue  and \ncommunity-rating  reforms  do  not  .  .  .  address  the  issue  of \nhealthy  individuals  who  choose  not  to  purchase  insurance  to \ncover  potential  health  care  needs[,]”  id.,  Congress  “required \nindividuals  to  maintain  health  insurance  coverage  [(the \nindividual mandate)] or make a shared responsibility payment to \nthe Internal Revenue Service[,]” (ECF No. 44, ¶ 34). \nThird,  the  ACA  requires  ACA-compliant  plans  to  cover \nessential health benefits and limits “so-called ‘cost-sharing’ – \nfor example, deductibles and copayments – for essential health \nbenefits  coverage[.]”  (ECF  No.  44,  ¶  33b).    The  ACA  also \n“prohibits  plans  from  imposing  annual  or  lifetime  limits”  on \nessential health benefits coverage.  (Id.). \nFourth, the ACA “seeks to make insurance more affordable by \ngiving  refundable  tax  credits  to  individuals  with  household \nincomes  between  100  percent  and  400  percent  of  the  federal \npoverty line [(“FPL”)].”  (ECF No. 44, ¶ 33c (quoting King, 135 \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 5 of 67\nS.Ct. at 2487)).  Qualified individuals receive income-related, \npremium-based  tax  credits  (advance  premium  tax  credits  or \n“APTCs”).3    (Id.).    The  ACA  “also  requires  health  insurance \nissuers to reduce certain individuals’ cost-sharing expenditures \nand  directs  HHS  to  reimburse  issuers  for  such  cost-sharing \nreductions (‘CSRs’).”  (Id.). \n“To  facilitate  individuals’  ability  to  learn  about  and \nenroll  in  the  health  insurance  options  that  are  available  to \nthem, the ACA ‘requires the creation of an “Exchange” in each \nState  where  people  can  shop  for  insurance,  usually  online.’”  \n(ECF  No.  44,  ¶  35  (quoting  King,  135  S.Ct.  at  2487)).    “An \nexchange may be established by the state in which it operates \nor,  in  states  that  elect  not  to  establish  exchanges,  by  the \nfederal government.”4  (Id., ¶ 38). \nThe  exchanges  serve  as  marketplaces,  allowing  people  not \neligible for Medicare or Medicaid to compare and purchase ACA-\ncompliant insurance plans, known as “qualified health plans” or \n“QHPs”  under  the  Act.    (ECF  No.  44,  ¶ 35).    Individuals  may \n \n3 “Those with income below 100 percent of FPL generally are \nnot eligible for APTC payments because the ACA contemplated that \nthey would instead be eligible for Medicaid.”  (ECF No. 92, at \n30). \n \n4 The exchange in Illinois is a hybrid exchange (an exchange \nthat “assume[s] some, but not all, exchange functions[]”), the \nexchange in Maryland is a state-based exchange (“SBE”), and the \nexchanges  in  Ohio  and  Pennsylvania  are  federally-facilitated \nexchanges (“FFEs”).  (ECF No. 44, ¶ 38). \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 6 of 67\nenroll  during  an  annual  open  enrollment  period  or,  after  a \nqualifying life event, during a special enrollment period.  The \nexchanges “help consumers make smart health insurance choices by \nrunning call centers and providing in-person assistance.”  (Id., \n¶ 37).    Pertinently,  “the  ACA  requires  that  exchanges  award \ngrants to healthcare ‘Navigators’ to ‘carry out . . . duties” \nthat  are  specified  by  statute  and  in  HHS  implementing \nregulations[.]” (Id. (citations omitted)). \n“The ACA requires that exchanges offer only quality health \ninsurance[.]”  (ECF  No.  44,  ¶  39).    Such  coverage  “improve[s] \naccess  to  care  and  overall  health[]”  and  “reduce[s]  financial \nburdens  for  both  individuals  and  institutions  that  cover  the \ncosts  of  uncompensated  care.”    (Id.).    Plaintiffs  allege  that \nincreasing  enrollment  in  quality  health  insurance  coverage  is \nboth the ACA’s immediate goal and the key to the ACA’s long-term \nsuccess.    Enrollment  “must  be  high  enough  to  reduce  random \nfluctuations  in  claims  from  year  to  year[.]”  (Id.).    Enough \nhealthy  individuals  must  enroll  to  spread  the  costs  of  less-\nhealthy individuals.  (Id.).  To promote increased enrollment, \nhealth  care  costs  must  be  limited.    (Id.,  ¶ 40).    Plaintiffs \nallege  that  before  Defendants’  actions,  “the  ACA’s  reforms \nsuccessfully met Congress’s goal of enabling more individuals – \nspecifically, 20 million more individuals – to enroll in health \ninsurance coverage.”  (Id., ¶¶ 41-43). \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 7 of 67\nB.  Defendants’ Challenged Actions \nPlaintiffs  dedicate  12  pages  of  the  amended  complaint  to \ncataloging the many statements made by the President and members \nof his Administration that they allege express contempt for the \nAct.  (ECF No. 44, ¶¶ 44-48).  According to Plaintiffs, these \nstatements  evince  “the  Administration’s  intent  to  repeal  the \nACA, with or without Congress.”  (Id., at 22). \nPlaintiffs  also  challenge  Defendants’  actions.    “At  issue \nhere are a final rule and a long list. . . of other executive \nactions, all undertaken by the Trump Administration to undermine \nthe ACA.”  (ECF No. 44, ¶ 9).  “The final rule is [CMS’s] Notice \nof Benefit and Payment Parameters for 2019, 83 Fed. Reg. 16,930 \n(April 17, 2018), referenced here as the ‘2019 Rule’ [because] \nit governs many aspects of ACA insurance markets starting in the \n2019 plan year.”  (Id., ¶ 10).  The challenged executive actions \ninclude two executive orders, Executive Order No. 13,765, titled \n“Minimizing  the  Economic  Burden  of  the  Patient  Protection  and \nAffordable  Care  Act  Pending  Repeal,”  82  Fed.  Reg.  8,351  (Jan. \n20,  2017)  and  Executive  Order  No.  13,813,  titled  “Promoting \nHealthcare Choice and Competition Across the United States,” 82 \nFed. Reg. 48,385 (Oct. 12, 2017). \n1.  The 2019 Rule \nPlaintiffs  allege  that  the  2019  Rule  implements  changes \n“that  increase  the  cost  of  health  coverage  and  impose  other \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 8 of 67\nbarriers to enrollment.”  (ECF No. 44, ¶ 10).  They allege that \nthe 2019 Rule undermines the Act’s safeguards and requirements \nand that “provisions of the 2019 Rule roll back protections that \nthe  Act  guarantees,  make  it  more  difficult  to  enroll  in  ACA-\ncompliant plans, and drive up the cost of ACA-compliant plans.”  \n(Id., ¶ 50).  They argue that nine particular provisions of the \n2019  Rule  violate  the  APA  because  the  “changes  lack  adequate \njustification  and,  in  some  instances,  violate  the  Affordable \nCare Act’s text[.]” (Id. at ¶ 10). \nPlaintiffs  allege  that  the  first  three  challenged \nprovisions  of  the  2019  Rule  will  eliminate  protections \nguaranteed by the ACA.  The first challenged provision of the \n2019 Rule relates to APTCs.  (ECF No. 44, ¶¶ 52-56).  The ACA \n“required  HHS  to  promulgate  regulations  further  defining  APTC \neligibility.”  (Id., ¶ 52).  HHS regulations include a “failure \nto reconcile provision” which directs “exchanges to deny APTCs \nto  an  individual  if  the  [IRS]  notifies  the  exchange  that  the \nindividual or a member of her household did not reconcile the \namount  of  advance  premium  tax  credits  she  received  with  the \namount  of  the  actual  premium  tax  credit  she  should  have  been \nallowed on her prior year’s tax return.” (Id. (emphasis added)).  \nIn  2016,  the  failure  to  reconcile  provision  was  amended  “to \nspecify that an exchange may not deny APTC under this provision \n‘unless direct notification is first sent to the tax filer . . . \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 9 of 67\nthat his or her eligibility will be discontinued as a result of \nthe tax filer’s failure to comply with the requirement.’”  (Id. \n(quoting 45 C.F.R. § 155.305(f)(4)(ii)(2016)(effective Jan. 17, \n2017  to  June  17,  2018))).    The  2019  Rule  removes  the  advance \ndirect  notification  requirement.5    Plaintiffs  allege  that  this \nchange  “will  cause  eligible  individuals  to  lose  the  subsidies \nthat  the  ACA  guarantees[]”  and  that  “[t]he  unexpected  loss  of \nthis assistance would likely cause many if not most individuals \nto drop coverage entirely[.]”  (Id., ¶ 56).  \nThe second challenged provision of the 2019 Rule relates to \nthe  compliance  review  of  insurance  plans  to  be  offered  on \nfederal exchanges.  (ECF No. 44, ¶¶ 57-63).  The ACA requires \nthe Secretary of HHS to establish, by regulation, “‘criteria for \nthe certification of health plans as [QHPs],’ including criteria \nthat ‘ensure a sufficient choice of providers,’ – i.e., criteria \nthat  ensure  network  adequacy.”    (Id.,  ¶ 57  (quoting  42  U.S.C. \n§ 18031(c)) (internal citations omitted)).  The criteria require \nan  exchange  to  “implement  procedures  for  the  certification, \nrecertification,  and  decertification  .  .  .  of  health  plans  as \n[QHPs].”    (Id.  (quoting  42  U.S.C.  §  18031(d)(4)(A))).  \nPreviously, “CMS, acting as the exchange in states with [FFEs] . \n. . review[ed] network adequacy and accreditation status plans \n \n5  The  2019  Rule  “indicates  that  FFEs  will  continue  to \nprovide direct notification[.]” (ECF No. 44, ¶ 55). \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 10 of 67\nthat insurers proposed to offer[.]” (Id., ¶ 58).  The 2019 Rule \nallows  CMS  to  “‘rely  on  the  [s]tates’  reviews’  of  network \nadequacy  and  other  critical  requirements  in  certain  [FFEs].”6  \n(Id.,  ¶ 59  (quoting  83  Fed.  Reg.  at  17,024-26)).    Plaintiffs \nallege  that  “[o]utsourcing  federal  plan  review  to  states  will \npermit insurers to market plans with overly restrictive networks \nof providers – networks that could thereby limit patient access \nto  care.”    (Id.,  ¶ 63).    As  a  result,  the  rate  of  the \nunderinsured will increase because “[m]ore consumers will end up \npurchasing inadequate plans[.]” (Id.). \nThe third challenged provision of the 2019 Rule relates to \nfederal  oversight  of  insurance  brokers  participating  in  direct \nenrollment.  (ECF No. 44, ¶¶ 64-68).  “Direct enrollment is a \nprocess  under  which  a  consumer  enrolls  in  an  ACA-compliant \nhealth insurance plan through a third-party website instead of \nthrough  the  governmental  platform[.]”  (Id.,  ¶ 65).    Previous \nrules  “provided  a  strong  oversight  structure”  and  required \nthird-party  audits  by  HHS-approved  auditors  because  “direct \nenrollment  entities  were  committing  fraud,  signing  up \nindividuals  without  their  knowledge  or  consent,  and  using \ninaccurate calculators for APTC eligibility[.]” (Id.).  The 2019 \nRule  eliminates  this  protection  and  allows  direct  enrollment \n \n6 This represents an extension of a “policy first adopted in \nthe 2018 Market Stabilization Rule, 82 Fed. Reg. 18,346, 18371-\n72 (April 18, 2017)[.]”  (ECF No. 44, ¶ 59). \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 11 of 67\nentities to select their own third-party auditors without HHS’s \ninitial  review  and  approval.  (Id.,  ¶ 66).    Plaintiffs  allege \nthat  the  reduced  oversight  “will  increase  the  likelihood  that \nconsumers  receive  inaccurate  information,  thus  decreasing \noverall  enrollment  and  leading  to  a  rise  in  the  rate  of  the \nuninsured [and underinsured].” (Id., ¶ 68). \nPlaintiffs allege that the next four challenged provisions \nof the 2019 Rule will deter Americans from enrolling in QHPs.  \nThe  fourth  challenged  provision  of  the  2019  Rule  relates  to \nstandardized options.  (ECF No. 44, ¶¶ 70-74).  Previous “rules \nsupported  ‘standardized  options,’  which  are  qualified  health \nplans  at  different  levels  of  coverage  with  a  cost-sharing \nstructured  specified  by  HHS[.]”  (Id.,  ¶ 70).    HHS  previously \nsupported  standardized  options  because  “an  excessive  number  of \nhealth plan options makes consumers less likely to make any plan \nselection, more likely to make a selection that does not match \ntheir  health  needs,  and  more  likely  to  make  a  selection  that \nleaves  them  less  satisfied.”  (Id.,  ¶ 71  (quoting  CMS,  Patient \nProtection  and  Affordable  Care  Act;  HHS  Notice  of  Benefit  and \nPayment  Parameters  for  2017,  81  Fed.  Reg.  12,204,  12,205, \n12,289-293 (Mar. 8, 2016))).  The 2019 Rule discontinues support \nfor standardized options.  (Id., ¶ 72).  Plaintiffs allege that \neliminating  support  for  standardized  options  “makes  it  more \ndifficult  for  consumers  to  select  appropriate  health  coverage, \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 12 of 67\nand also increases the risk that they will go without coverage \nentirely.” (Id., ¶ 73).  They also allege “eliminating support \nfor standardized options will limit the degree to which health \nplans will compete on price; instead, some plans will choose to \ncompete  on  benefit  design  in  a  gambit  to  discourage  high-risk \nenrollees.” (Id., ¶ 74).  “Without standardized options, it will \nbe harder for individuals to select coverage, prices will rise, \nand the rate of the uninsured and underinsured will increase.”  \n(Id.). \nThe fifth challenged provision of the 2019 Rule relates to \nthe Navigator program.  (ECF No. 44, ¶¶ 75-79).  Previous rules \nrequired  each  exchange  “to  have  two  Navigators,  one  of  those \nNavigators was required to be a community- and consumer-focused \nnonprofit,  and  Navigators  were  required  to  have  physical \npresences in the areas they served.”  (Id., ¶ 75).  The 2019 \nRule eliminates these requirements.  (Id.).  Plaintiffs allege \nthat  the  elimination  of  these  requirements  “will  decrease \nindividuals’  and  families’  in-person  access  to  complete, \nimpartial  information[]”  and  “dampen  overall  enrollment, \nespecially  among  vulnerable  populations[.]”    (Id.,  ¶ 79).  \nPlaintiffs emphasize the importance of in-person assistance for \nminority  populations  and  young  people  and  the  statistic  that \n“[p]eople who receive in-person assistance are nearly 40 percent \nmore likely to enroll in coverage than people who are forced to \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 13 of 67\ngo  it  alone.”    (Id.).    They  conclude  that  the  elimination  of \nthese  Navigator  requirements  will  “increase  the  rate  of  the \nuninsured [and underinsured].”  (Id.). \nThe sixth challenged provision of the 2019 Rule relates to \nsmall business exchanges.  (ECF No. 44, ¶¶ 80-82).  Under the \nACA,  exchanges  must  provide  for  the  establishment  of  a  Small \nBusiness  Health  Options  Program  (a  “SHOP  Exchange”)  to  assist \ncertain “small employers in facilitating the enrollment of their \nemployees in [QHPs] offered in the small group market.”  (Id., ¶ \n80  (quoting  42  U.S.C.  §  18031(b)(1)(B))).    The  ACA  also \n“requires  SHOP  exchanges  to  ‘make  available  [QHPs]  to  .  .  . \nqualified  employers,’  to  protect  employers’  and  employees’ \nchoice among certain [QHPs], and to protect employees’ ability \nto  enroll  even  after  their  employer  no  longer  qualifies  as  a \nsmall  employer  under  the  Act.”    (Id.  (internal  citations \nomitted)).    “Under  prior  rules,  CMS  interpreted  the  ACA  as \n‘requiring  that  all  SHOPs  provide  for  employer  eligibility, \nemployee  eligibility,  and  certain  enrollment  functions, \nincluding premium aggregation functions.”  (Id., ¶ 81 (citing 83 \nFed. Reg. at 16,996)).  The 2019 Rule “purport[s] to reinterpret \nthe  ACA  and  remove  these  requirements.”    (Id.).    Plaintiffs \nallege  that  “[b]y  eliminating  the  requirement  that  SHOP \nexchanges  allow  employers  to  determine  employee  eligibility, \naggregate premiums, and enroll employees online, the 2019 Rule \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 14 of 67\nmakes  it  more  difficult  for  small  businesses  to  offer  workers \nand  their  dependents  affordable  coverage,  and  thereby  will \nincrease  the  size  of  the  uninsured  population.”    (Id.,  ¶ 82).  \nAdditionally, Plaintiffs allege that “[t]hese changes will . . . \npush small businesses to use a broker or buy directly from an \ninsurance  company,  limiting  their  ability  to  make  plan \ncomparisons  and  shop  by  price  for  appropriate  coverage, \npotentially raising their premiums.”  (Id.). \nThe seventh challenged provision of the 2019 Rule relates \nto  income  verification  requirements  imposed  on  individuals \nseeking APTCs.  (ECF No. 44, ¶¶ 83-86).  The 2019 Rule imposes \n“income verification requirements ‘where electronic data sources \nreflect income under 100 percent FPL and a consumer attests to \nincome  between  100  percent  FPL  and  400  percent  FPL.’”    (Id., \n¶ 83 (citing 83 Fed. Reg. at 16,985)).  The income verification \nrequirement  originated  “[o]ut  of  purported  concern  that \nindividuals  inflate  their  income  above  the  FPL  to  gain  APTCs, \nresulting  in  the  payment  of  APTCs  to  those  not  entitled  to \nreceive  them[.]”  (Id.).    Plaintiffs  allege  that  “making  it \nharder for consumers to obtain insurance tax credits . . . will \nlikely  mean  that  more  consumers  will  choose  to  go  without \ncoverage entirely – i.e., that the rate of the uninsured will \nincrease.”  (Id., ¶ 85).  Significantly, “paperwork burdens have \nhistorically  deterred  enrollment  of  people  with  relatively  low \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 15 of 67\nneed  for  health  care;  those  with  high  health  care  needs  will \nwork  harder  to  get  coverage.”    (Id.).    Thus,  Plaintiffs  also \nallege that the income verification requirement “will worsen the \nrisk  pool  and  raise  premiums,  causing  coverage  to  become  less \naffordable.”  (Id.). \nPlaintiffs allege that the final two challenged provisions \nof  the  2019  Rule  will  drive  up  costs.    The  eighth  challenged \nprovision curtails review of insurance rate increases.  (ECF No. \n44, ¶¶ 88-93).  “Under the ACA, ‘[t]he Secretary, in conjunction \nwith States, shall establish a process for the annual review . . \n.  of  unreasonable  increases  in  premiums  for  health  insurance \ncoverage.’”  (Id., ¶ 88 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-94(a)(1))).  \nCMS  “promulgated  regulations  that  require  insurers  to  justify \nannual  rate  increases  above  a  given  threshold.”    (Id.).    The \n2019  Rule  changes  this  scheme  by  (1)  exempting  student  health \nplans from rate review and (2) raising the threshold for rate \nreview  from  rate  increases  of  10%  to  rate  increases  of  15%.  \n(Id.,  ¶ 89).    Plaintiffs  allege  that  “the  2019  Rule’s  .  .  . \nchanges  to  rate  review  will  make  it  easier  for  insurers  to \nincrease  rates  without  adequate  justification;  the  purpose  of \nrate  review  is  for  insurance  commissioners  and  the  public  to \nexamine  the  proposed  reasons  for  health  insurance  premium \nincreases  in  the  individual  and  small-group  market  and  adjust \nthem  as  appropriate  to  improve  affordability  for  consumers.”  \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 16 of 67\n(Id., ¶ 93).  Plaintiffs point to statistical data from 2011 and \n2015  to  demonstrate  the  effectiveness  of  rate  review.7    They \nallege  that  “if  prices  are  permitted  to  increase  without  the \nsignificant  check  provided  by  rate  review,  individuals  will \nincreasingly  decide  to  go  without  appropriate  coverage  or  any \ncoverage  at  all  –  driving  up  the  rate  of  uninsured  and \nunderinsured individuals.”  (Id.). \nThe ninth, and final, challenged provision of the 2019 Rule \nrelates to rebates for poor insurer performance.  (ECF No. 44, \n¶¶ 94-98).  This provision involves the “medical loss ratio” or \n“MLR.”    The  MLR  is  “the  percentage  of  each  premium  that \n[insurers]  spend  on  paying  claims  and  improving  their \nservices[.]”  (Id.,  ¶  94).    Under  the  ACA,  insurers  must  pay \nrebates  if  the  MLR  “drops  below  85  percent  (for  large  group \ninsurance plans) or 80 percent (for small group and individual \ninsurance  plans).”  (Id.,  (citing  42  U.S.C.  §  300gg-\n18(b)(1)(A))).    “These  minimum  MLR  standards  are  intended  to \nhelp  ensure  that  individuals  covered  under  private  health \ninsurance  plans  (enrollees)  receive  adequate  value  for  their \npremiums  and  to  create  incentives  for  insurers  to  become  more \n \n7  “In  2011,  one  in  five  proposed  premium  increases  was \nreduced  through  rate  review,  with  rates  that  went  into  effect \napproximately one-fifth lower than those initially requested by \nthe  insurer.”    (ECF  No.  44,  ¶ 93).    “In  2015,  rate  review \nlowered  premiums  in  the  individual  and  small  group  markets  by \n$1.5 billion.”  (Id.). \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 17 of 67\nefficient in their operations.”  (Id.).  The 2019 Rule “alters \nthe  method  by  which  rebates  are  awarded[]”  by  “allow[ing] \ninsurers  to  claim  a  flat  0.8  percent  of  premium  credit  for \nquality improvement activities (“QIA”) – i.e., ‘activities that \npromote  health  care  quality,’  when  calculating  medical  loss \nratio, rather than a percent based on the amount actually spent \non such activities.  (Id., ¶ 95 (internal citations omitted)).  \n“In other words, the 2019 Rule allows insurers to take credit \nfor  improving  their  services  whether  or  not  they  actually  did \nso.”    (Id.).    Plaintiffs  allege  that  since  the  beginning  of \nACA’s  medical  loss  ratio  policy  in  2012,  enrollees  “have \nreceived nearly $4 billion in rebates.”  (Id., ¶ 98).  In 2018, \ninsurers  paid  “nearly  $707  million  in  rebates[.]”  (Id.).  \nPlaintiffs allege that “[b]y allowing insurers [increasingly to \navoid]  paying  these  rebates,  the  2019  Rule  will  effectively \ncause consumers to pay more for worse insurance, leading to an \nincrease  in  the  number  of  consumers  that  lack  appropriate \ncoverage.”  (Id.). \n2.  Defendants’ Executive Actions \nPlaintiffs  allege  that,  in  addition  to  the  2019  Rule, \nDefendants  “have  taken  many  other  actions  with  the  intent  and \neffect of sabotaging the Act generally and its private insurance \nreforms and exchanges in particular.”  (ECF No. 44, ¶ 99).  They \nallege  that  these  actions  “establish  Defendants’  pattern  and \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 18 of 67\npractice  of  taking  executive  action  to  undermine  the  Act[.]” \n(Id.)    They  divide  the  actions  into  five  categories:  (1) \ndirecting  agencies  to  sabotage  the  Act;  (2)  attempting  to \ndestabilize  the  exchanges;  (3)  working  to  decrease  enrollment; \n(4) arbitrarily driving up premiums; and (5) refusing to defend \nthe Act. \nPlaintiffs  first  outline  Defendants’  actions  directing \nagencies to sabotage the ACA.  (ECF No. 44, ¶¶ 100-103).  They \nhighlight Executive Order No. 13,765 (“EO 13,765”).  EO 13,765 \nannounced  the  policy  of  the  Trump  Administration  “to  seek  the \nprompt  repeal  of  the  [ACA]”  and  directed  Administration \nofficials to “take all actions consistent with law to minimize \nthe  unwarranted  economic  and  regulatory  burdens  of  the  Act.” \n(ECF No. 44, ¶ 100 (quoting 82 Fed. Reg. 8,351 (Jan. 20, 2017)).  \nEO  13,765  signaled  that  the  Trump  Administration  might  not \nenforce the individual mandate.  One estimate, from Joshua Peck, \nthe  Chief  Marketing  Officer  for  the  federal  government’s  ACA \nexchange until 2016 and an amicus curiae presently, forecasted \nthat  such  signaling  “resulted  in  130,000  fewer  individuals \nenrolling in health insurance during the open enrollment period \nfor  2017  plan  year  insurance[.]”    (Id.,  ¶ 102).    Indeed,  EO \n17,365  “resulted  in  reduced  enforcement  of  the  individual \nmandate[.]” (Id.). \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 19 of 67\nPlaintiffs next outline Defendants’ actions to destabilize \nthe exchanges.  Plaintiffs allege that Defendants’ strategy was \nto sow uncertainty in insurance markets.  Defendants’ challenged \nactions include:  (1) threatening to discontinue, and ultimately \ndiscontinuing, reimbursing insurers for cost-sharing reductions \n(ECF No. 44, ¶¶ 105-108); (2) issuing Executive Order No. 13,813 \n(“EO 13,813”) and thereby promoting non-ACA compliant plans to \ntry to weaken ACA exchanges (id., ¶¶ 109-115); (3) undermining \nthe  individual  mandate  (id.,  ¶¶  116-122);  (4)  delaying  or \ndenying state waiver requests under Section 1332 of the Act that \nwould further the Act’s goals (id., ¶¶ 123-126);8 (5) enabling \nand encouraging states to seek Section 1332 waivers that would \nundercut the Act’s goals (id., ¶¶ 127-128); and (6) attempting \nto weaken public confidence in ACA exchanges (id., ¶¶ 129-132). \nPlaintiffs  also  outline  Defendants’  actions  to  decrease \nenrollment.    These  actions  include:  (1)  halving  the  open \nenrollment  period  and  increasing  planned  downtime  for  the \nfederal health insurance exchange website (ECF No. 44, ¶¶ 135-\n \n8  “Section  1332  of  the  ACA,  42  U.S.C.  § 18052,  permits \nstates to apply for waivers of some of the law’s requirements in \norder  to  promote  innovative  policies  that  satisfy  certain \nstatutorily-prescribed  guardrails[.]”  (ECF  No.  44,  ¶ 123).  \n“Crucially, for example, states may only seek waivers that would \n‘provide  coverage  that  is  at  least  as  comprehensive  as’  ACA-\ncompliant  coverage.”    (Id.  (citing  42  U.S.C.  §  18052 \n(b)(1)(A))).    “In  keeping  with  these  guardrails,  only  certain \nACA  provisions  are  subject  to  waiver  under  Section  1332.”  \n(Id.). \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 20 of 67\n142);  (2)  drastically  reducing  funding  twice  (in  January  2017 \nand  in  August  2017)  for  advertising  and  refusing  to  publicize \nopen  enrollment  (id.,  ¶¶  143-154);  (3)  drastically  cutting \nfunding  twice  (in  2017  and  2018)  for  Navigators  working  in \nfederally-facilitated  exchanges  and  encouraging  them  to \nundermine  the  Act  by  “requiring  them  to  compete  for  funding \naccording  to  how  enthusiastically  they  plan  to  advertise  the \navailability  of  non-ACA  compliant  coverage”  (id.,  ¶¶  155-167); \n(4) failing to set numeric enrollment targets for 2018 and 2019 \ndespite  explicit  findings  from  the  Government  Accountability \nOffice  (“GAO”)  that  “failing  to  set  enrollment  targets  .  .  . \nhamper[s]  HHS’s  ability  to  measure  its  performance  and  make \ncritical  decisions  about  how  to  use  resources  to  facilitate \nenrollment[]” (id., ¶¶ 168-170); and (5) refusing to participate \nin  enrollment  events  and  other  outreach    (id.,  ¶¶  171-172).  \nPlaintiffs  allege  “two  of  the  decisions  at  issue  here  – \nshortening open enrollment and reducing outreach – may result in \nas  much  as  a  [nine]  percent  increase  in  premiums.”    (Id., \n¶ 134). \nFinally, Plaintiffs outline Defendants’ efforts to drive up \npremiums and Defendants’ refusal to defend the ACA.  (ECF No. \n44, ¶¶ 173-180).  Plaintiffs’ allegations regarding Defendants’ \nefforts to drive up premiums focus on a proposed rule, see CMS, \nProposed  Rule,  Notice  of  Benefit  and  Payment  Parameters  for \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 21 of 67\n2020,  --  Fed.  Reg.  00  (Jan.  17,  2019)  (the  “2020  Proposed \nRule”).    (ECF  No.  44,  ¶ 173).    Plaintiffs  allege  that \nDefendants’ refusal to defend the ACA in the ongoing litigation \nover  the  individual  mandate  “is  a  dramatic  example  of  how \nDefendants  are  eager  to  invalidate,  rather  than  to  implement, \ncore ACA provisions.”  (Id., ¶ 179). \nPlaintiffs’  allegations  regarding  the  2019  Rule  support \ntheir APA claim in Count I.  Plaintiffs’ allegations regarding \nboth  the  2019  Rule  and  Defendants’  other  executive  actions \nsupport their Take Care Clause claim in Count II. \nII.  Procedural Background \nOn  January  25,  2019,  Plaintiffs  filed  the  amended \ncomplaint.  (ECF No. 44).  On March 8, 2019, Defendants filed \nthe  presently  pending  motion  to  dismiss.    (ECF  No.  52).  \nPlaintiffs responded, (ECF No. 61), and Defendants replied (ECF \nNo. 92).  Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiffs’ complaint for \nlack of subject matter jurisdiction under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) \nand for failure to state a claim under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). \nAlso pending are five motions for leave to file memoranda \nas amici curiae in support of Plaintiffs.9  (ECF Nos. 65; 66; 67; \n \n9 The potential amici include: (1) the United States House \nof  Representatives  (ECF  No.  65);  (2)  the  City  of  Berkeley, \nCalifornia, Cook County, Illinois, the City of Dayton, Ohio, the \nCity  of  Los  Angeles,  California,  the  City  of  Minneapolis, \nMinnesota,  Montgomery  County,  Maryland,  the  City  of  Oakland, \nCalifornia,  the  City  of  Saint  Paul,  Minnesota,  the  City  and \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 22 of 67\n71; 76).

Council,  No.  08-0967-DKC,  2012  WL \n832756,  at  *3  (D.Md.  Mar.  9,  2012).    Rule  29  indicates  that \namici should state “the reason why an amicus brief is desirable \nand why the matters asserted are relevant to the disposition of \nthe case.”  Fed.R.App.P. 29(a)(3).   As noted by Judge Davis in \nBryant, “[t]he aid of amici curiae has been allowed at the trial \nlevel where they provide helpful analysis of the law, they have \na  special  interest  in  the  subject  matter  of  the  suit,  or \nexisting counsel is in need of assistance.”  Bryant, 923 F.Supp. \nat 728 (citations omitted).  Here, the motions will be granted.  \nEach demonstrated a special interest in the outcome of the suit \nand provided helpful information to the court. \nIII.  Justiciability \nDefendants  contend  that  the  complaint  should  be  dismissed \nfor lack of subject matter jurisdiction because Plaintiffs lack \nstanding and because their claims are not ripe.  (ECF No. 52-1, \nat 23–38; ECF No. 92, at 9–17).  Plaintiffs disagree.  (ECF No. \n61, at 23–45). \n“A  challenge  to  subject  matter  jurisdiction  under \n[Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1)] may proceed ‘in one of two ways’: either \na  facial  challenge,  asserting  that  the  allegations  pleaded  in \nthe  complaint  are  insufficient  to  establish  subject  matter \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 24 of 67\njurisdiction,  or  a  factual  challenge,  asserting  “‘that  the \njurisdictional  allegations  of  the  complaint  [are]  not  true.’”  \nMayor  of  Balt.  v.  Trump,  416  F.Supp.3d  452,  479  (D.Md.  2019) \n(quoting  Kerns  v.  United  States,  585  F.3d  187,  192  (4th  Cir. \n2009).    In  a  facial  challenge,  “the  facts  alleged  in  the \ncomplaint are taken as true, and the motion must be denied if \nthe complaint alleges sufficient facts to invoke subject matter \njurisdiction.”  Kerns, 585 F.3d at 192.  In a factual challenge, \n“the  district  court  is  entitled  to  decide  disputed  issues  of \nfact” and may “‘go beyond the allegations of the complaint and \nin  an  evidentiary  hearing  determine  if  there  are  facts  to \nsupport the jurisdictional allegations.’”  Id. (quoting Adams v. \nBain,  697  F.2d  1213,  1219  (4th  Cir.  1982)).    “The  burden  of \nestablishing  subject  matter  jurisdiction  rests  with  the \nplaintiff.”  Demetres v. East West Constr., Inc., 776 F.3d 271, \n272 (4th Cir. 2015). \nA. Standing \n“Article  III  standing  is  ‘part  and  parcel  of  the \nconstitutional  mandate  that  the  judicial  power  of  the  United \nStates extend only to cases and controversies.’”  Baehr v. Creig \nNorthrop Team, P.C., 953 F.3d 244, 252 (4th Cir. 2020) (quoting \nLibertarian  Party  of  Va.  v.  Judd,  718  F.3d  308,  313  (4th  Cir. \n2013).  “To establish Article III standing, an injury must be \n‘concrete,  particularized,  and  actual  or  imminent;  fairly \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 25 of 67\ntraceable  to  the  challenged  action;  and  redressable  by  a \nfavorable ruling.’”  Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, \n409  (2013).    These  three  elements  are  “the  irreducible \nconstitutional  minimum  of  standing[.]”    Lujan  v.  Defs.  of \nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992). \nDefendants appear to mount a facial challenge to standing, \nalthough they rely on declarations of Jeff Wu, Deputy Director \nfor Policy for the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance \nOversight,  for  some  of  their  arguments,  and  use  language \nindicative  of  a  factual  challenge  at  times.    Plaintiffs’ \nresponse to the challenge reflects their understanding that the \nchallenge is facial.  The issue will be resolved based on the \nallegations in the amended complaint. \n1.  Injury in Fact \n“To establish injury in fact, a plaintiff must show that he \nor  she  suffered  ‘an  invasion  of  a  legally  protected  interest’ \nthat is ‘concrete and particularized’ and ‘actual or imminent, \nnot conjectural or hypothetical.’”  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 \nS.Ct. 1540, 1548 (2016) (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560). \nDefendants  contend  that  the  Individual  Plaintiffs  lack \nstanding because “even assuming that rising premiums alone could \nconstitute an injury in fact . . . the Individual Plaintiffs’ \nprediction  about  continued  rising  individual  market  insurance \npremiums has been proven to be incorrect.”  (ECF No. 52-1, at \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 26 of 67\n25).    Defendants  elaborate  that  “the  2019  premiums  for  such \ninsurance in [the county where the Individual Plaintiffs live] \nhas  seen  dramatic  decreases[]”  and  that  “a  new  insurer, \nHealthKeepers, Inc. (affiliated with Anthem, Inc.), entered the \n. . . market in 2019.”  (Id.). \nPlaintiffs  respond  that  the  Individual  Plaintiffs  “have \nstanding because Defendants’ actions have caused issuers . . . \nto charge them . . . higher premiums.”  (ECF No. 61, at 33).  \nThey elaborate: \nDefendants’  actions  led  to  significant \npremium  increases  nationwide  from  2017  to \n2019.  Charlottesville, Virginia, where the \nIndividual  Plaintiffs  reside,  is  no \nexception.    Overall,  premiums  tripled  in \nCharlottesville  in  2018,  becoming  the \nhighest  in  the  nation.    In  2017,  the \nIndividual Plaintiffs paid a monthly premium \nof  $1,270  for  an  Optima  silver  plan;  in \n2018,  they  paid  $3,300  a  month  for  their \nOptima bronze plan, 261 percent higher than \ntheir 2017 premium, and with a significantly \nhigher deductible of $14,400.  Now, in 2019, \nthey  pay  $1,899  a  month  for  their  Anthem \nbronze  plan  –  still  50  percent  higher  than \nwhat they paid for the Optima silver plan in \n2017 – with a deductible of $13,000.  Anthem \nalso raised its statewide rates from 2018 to \n2019 by 3.2 percent.  Indeed, the price of \nthe  plan  purchased  by  the  Individual \nPlaintiffs  itself  rose  by  1.6  percent  from \n2018 to 2019. \n \n(Id., at 34–35 (citations omitted and emphasis in original)). \n  Plaintiffs’  allegations,  reduced  to  the  minimum,  recite \nthat they were insured by Optima in 2017 and 2018 and switched \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 27 of 67\nto Anthem in 2019.  While their actual premium with Anthem in \n2019 is lower than their actual premium with Optima in 2018, the \nAnthem  premium  in  2019  was  higher  than  the  Anthem  premium  in \n2018 was for the same plan. \nPlaintiffs allege that their increased premiums constitute \nconcrete  injury  and  cite  several  cases  in  support  of  their \ncontention.  (Id., at 33 (citing Stewart v. Azar, 313 F.Supp.3d \n237,  252  (D.D.C.  2018)  (“Plaintiffs  would  be  required  to  pay \nincreased premiums and thus would suffer a concrete injury[.]”); \nAARP v. EEOC, 226 F.Supp.3d 7, 18 (D.D.C. 2016) (“An increase in \npremiums would certainly constitute an injury.”).10  Defendants \ndo not address these cases, instead noting that the Individual \nPlaintiffs  “acknowledge  that  their  2019  premiums  are  actually \nlower  than  their  2018  premiums,”  (ECF  No.  92,  at  14),  and \nfocusing  on  traceability,  (id.,  at  10-15).    The  increase  in \npremiums constitutes economic harm and is therefore “a classic \nand paradigmatic form of injury in fact[.]” Air Evac EMS, Inc. \nv. Cheatham, 910 F.3d 751, 760 (4th Cir. 2018).  The Individual \nPlaintiffs satisfy the first element of constitutional standing. \n \n10  Plaintiffs  also  emphasize  that  “Defendants  themselves \nrecently  endorsed  a  similar  theory  of  standing  in  Texas  v. \nUnited States,” explaining that “in Texas, Defendants say that \nhigher  premiums  constitute  ‘concrete  financial  and  practical \ninjuries.’”    (ECF  No.  61,  at  33–34  (quoting  Brief  for  the \nFederal Defendants at 24, Texas, No. 19-10011)).  Defendants do \nnot address this contention in their reply. \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 28 of 67\nDefendants similarly contend that the City Plaintiffs lack \nstanding  because  their  alleged  injury  –  harm  to  “the  City \nPlaintiffs’  budgets,  including  the  budgets  for  their  public \nhealth departments, free or reduced-cost clinics, and ambulance \nservices” -  “is premised on an even greater number of uncertain \nlinks in the causal chain, which are either premised on invalid \nassumptions  or  are  attributable  to  the  City  Plaintiffs \nthemselves.”    (ECF  No.  52-1,  at  31–32  (quoting  ECF  No.  44, \n¶ 197)).  Plaintiffs correctly note that this challenge does not \ndispute  that  budgetary  outlays  constitute  injury  in  fact  but \nrather  focuses  on  traceability.    (ECF  No.  61,  at  24).  \nPlaintiffs argue that “[a] city has standing ‘when a harm to the \ncity itself has been alleged[,]’” (id., at 38 (quoting City of \nOlmstead Falls v. FAA, 292 F.3d 261, 268 (D.C. Cir. 2002), and \nelaborates  that  a  city  may  sue  to  protect  its  proprietary \ninterests,  including  “‘management,  public  safety,  [and] \neconomic’ harms[,]” (id. (quoting City of Sausalito v. O’Neill, \n386  F.3d  1186,  1197-99  (9th  Cir.  2004).    Plaintiffs  also \nhighlight  four  cases  that  have  found  standing  where  policies \nhave  shifted  costs  onto  governments  to  provide  uncompensated \nhealth care: (1) Massachusetts v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human \nServs., 923 F.3d 209 (1st Cir. 2019); (2) California v. Azar, 911 \nF.3d  558  (9th  Cir.  2018);  (3)  Pennsylvania  v.  Trump,  351 \nF.Supp.3d  791  (E.D.Pa.  2019);  and  (4)  U.S.  House  of \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 29 of 67\nRepresentatives  v.  Price,  No.  16-5202,  2017  WL  3271445,  at  *1 \n(D.C. Cir. 2017) (per curiam).  Defendants again do not address \nPlaintiffs’  argument  but  focus  on  traceability.    The  City \nPlaintiffs satisfy the first element of constitutional standing. \n2.  Traceability and Redressability11 \n“For  an  injury  to  be  traceable,  ‘there  must  be  a  causal \nconnection between the injury and the conduct complained of’ by \nthe plaintiff.”  Air Evac EMS, Inc., 910 F.3d at 760 (quoting \nLujan, 504 U.S. at 560).  “While the defendant’s conduct need \nnot be the last link in the causal chain, the plaintiff must be \nable  to  demonstrate  that  the  alleged  harm  was  caused  by  the \ndefendant, as opposed to the ‘independent action of some third \nparty  not  before  the  court.’”  Id.  (quoting  Frank  Krasner \nEnters.,  Ltd.  v.  Montgomery  Cty.,  401  F.3d  230,  234  (4th  Cir. \n2005).  Although a plaintiff’s theory of standing may “not rest \non mere speculation about the decisions of third parties[,]” it \nmay  “rel[y]  instead  on  the  predictable  effect  of  Government \n \n11 The parties conflate their arguments regarding the second \nand third elements of constitutional standing: traceability and \nredressability.  (ECF No. 52-1, at 31 (“For similar reasons, nor \nwould the Individual Plaintiffs’ asserted injury be redressed by \nstriking  down  the  challenged  actions.”)  (alteration  and \nquotation marks omitted); ECF No. 61, at 38 (“By the same token, \nthe  Individual  Plaintiffs’  injuries  would  be  redressed  by  a \ndecision invalidating Defendants’ actions.”); ECF No. 92, at 15 \n(“Given the lack of causation, Plaintiffs also fail to show that \ntheir claimed injuries would be redressed by a decision setting \naside the challenged aspects of the 2019 Rule.”)). \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 30 of 67\naction on the decisions of third parties.”  Dep’t of Commerce v. \nNew York, 139 S.Ct. 2551, 2566 (2019). \nDefendants  contend  that  “Plaintiffs  have  not  established \nthat Defendants’ actions are the cause of Plaintiffs’ purported \nharms, nor can they make this showing.”  (ECF No. 52-1, at 25).  \nDefendants  primarily  advance  two  arguments  in  support  of  this \ncontention.  The first asserts that “the Individual Plaintiffs \nhave  not  shown  that  there  is  a  causal  link.  .  .  because \nDefendants  do  not  set  individual  health  insurance  premiums; \nrather, issuers set them by taking into account a wide range of \nfactors  that  are  in  turn  dependent  on  a  whole  host  of  other \nthird party actors.”  (Id., at 26).  Relatedly, Defendants argue \nthat  the  City  Plaintiffs’  “standing  allegations  are  even \nweaker[]” because “[t]heir alleged injury is premised on an even \ngreater number of uncertain links in the causal chain[.]”  (Id., \nat  31).    This  first  argument  focuses  on  third  party  actors.  \nDefendant’s  second  argument  emphasizes  that  Plaintiffs  must \ndemonstrate standing for each claim individually and argues that \nPlaintiffs fail to demonstrate that any of Defendants’ actions \nare a substantial factor in their injury.  (ECF No. 92, at 9-\n17). \nDefendants highlight two cases, Frank Krasner Enterprises, \nLtd.  v.  Montgomery  County,  401  F.3d  230  (4th  Cir.  2005),  and \nAmerican  Freedom  Law  Center  v.  Obama,  821  F.3d  44  (D.C.  Cir. \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 31 of 67\n2016), to support their first argument that third party actors \nbreak  the  chain  of  causation  between  their  challenged  actions \nand Plaintiffs’ injury.  (ECF No. 52-1, at 26–31).  Crucially, \n“the Frank Krasner [c]ourt did not establish that courts could \nnever  find  standing  when  the  ‘asserted  injury  arises  from  the \ngovernment's  allegedly  unlawful  regulation  (or  lack  of \nregulation)  of  someone  else,’  only  that  doing  so  will  be \n‘substantially more difficult.’”  Mayor of Balt., 416 F.Supp.3d \nat  489  (quoting  Frank  Krasner,  401  F.3d  at  235).    Judge \nHollander aptly summarized Frank Krasner’s limits:     \nIn  the  recent  case  of Department  of \nCommerce v. New York, ––– U.S. ––––, 139 S. \nCt.  2551,  204  L.Ed.2d  978  (2019),  the \nSupreme  Court  confronted  the  standing \narguments the government raises here.  That \ncase  involved  the  Department  of  Commerce’s \nplan  to  ask  about  citizenship  on  the  2020 \nUnited  States  Census.    Several  states, \ncounties,  cities,  and  other  entities \nchallenged  the  change  as  arbitrary  and \ncapricious  under  the  Administrative \nProcedure Act.  Id. at 2564.  The respondent \nchallengers  maintained  that  the  question \nwould  result  in  residents  declining  to \ncomplete  the  Census,  and  that  this \nunderreporting  would,  in  turn,  lead  to  a \nhost  of  injuries,  including  a  loss  of \nfederal  funds  for  states  with  a \ndisproportionate  share  of  noncitizen \nhouseholds.  Id. at 2565. \n \nThe  Department  of  Commerce  contested \nrespondents’  Article  III  standing  on  the \nground  that  the  alleged  harms  were  not \ntraceable to the Department’s actions but to \nthe  independent  actions  of  third \nparties.   Id. at  2565-66.    Indeed,  the \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 32 of 67\nDepartment  contended  that  the  chain  of \ncausation was further attenuated by the fact \nthat  the  intervening,  third  party-actions \nwere  unlawful  and  driven  by  “unfounded \nfears.”  Id.  The Supreme Court rejected the \nDepartment’s  argument, concluding  that \nrespondents  “met  their  burden  of  showing \nthat  third  parties  will  likely  react \nin predictable ways  to  the  citizenship \nquestion, even if they do so unlawfully and \ndespite the requirement that the Government \nkeep  individual  answers  confidential.” \nId. at 2566 (emphasis added).  As a result, \nthe  respondents’  theory  of  standing  “d[id] \nnot  rest  on  mere  speculation  about  the \ndecisions of third parties” but “instead on \nthe predictable effect of Government action \non the decisions of third parties.”  Id. \n \nId., 416 F.Supp.3d at 489.  Plaintiffs contend that “independent \nanalyses  and  issuers’  explanations  confirm  Plaintiffs’ \nallegations  that  Defendants’  actions  have  caused  price \nincreases.”  (ECF No. 61, at 37).  Plaintiffs have sufficiently \nalleged that insureds and issuers reacted in “predictable ways” \nto Defendants’ actions. \n  Defendants’  discussion  of  American  Freedom  Law  Center  is \nalso  unpersuasive.    Defendants  emphasize  the  language:  “[M]any \nfactors  determine  the  cost  of  health  care,  including \nadministrative costs, drug costs, and the health and age of the \nnational populace.  Changes in any of these factors could cause \ncosts to increase or decrease, and it is difficult to separate \nout which factors actually cause any specific price adjustment.”  \nAm. Freedom Law Ctr., 821 F.3d at 51.  However, American Freedom \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 33 of 67\nLaw  Center  does  not  conclude  that  a  plaintiff  can  never \nestablish  a  causal  link  between  increased  premiums  and \nchallenged  policies.    Contrary  to  Defendants’  assertion, \nPlaintiffs  provide  more  than  “unadorned  speculation  as  to  the \nexistence  of  a  relationship  between  the  challenged  government \naction  and  the  third-party  conduct[.]”  (ECF  No.  52-1,  at  29 \n(quoting  Am.  Freedom  Law  Ctr.,  821  F.3d  at  49)).    Plaintiffs \ncorrectly  note  that  Defendants  criticize  and  emphasize  one \nallegation,  “Healthkeepers’  statement  that  ‘the  elimination  of \nthe  individual  mandate  penalty  for  lack  of  minimum  essential \ncoverage and potential movement into other markets’ are factors \nthat the issuer considered in setting its 2019 health insurance \nrate[,]” (ECF No. 52-1, at 29 (quoting ECF No. 44, ¶ 277)), and \nignore  “page  upon  page  of  independent  studies  and  analyses, \nstatements  from  issuers,  and  statistics  [detailing]  how \nDefendants’  actions  have  harmed  health  insurance  markets.”12  \n \n12 Defendants also argue that “Congress’s reduction of the \nindividual mandate tax penalty to zero . . . is not attributable \nto Defendants (nor do Plaintiffs allege otherwise)[.]”  (ECF No. \n52-1, at 29).  Plaintiffs counter that “Defendants’ actions need \nnot be the sole cause” and regardless, the elimination of the \nindividual  mandate  and  its  resultant  encouragement  of \nindividuals  to  purchase  non-ACA  compliant  plans  “confirms, \nrather  than  defeats,  Plaintiffs’  allegations  concerning \ncausation;  the  availability  and  desirability  of  those \nalternatives  .  .  .  is  itself  a  result  of  Defendants’  own \ndecisions to expand access to them.”  (ECF No. 61, at 42–43).  \nPlaintiffs’  counterargument  is  persuasive.    Indeed,  their \nallegations  regarding  EO  13,813,  which  directed  the \nAdministration to expand access non-ACA compliant plans, state: \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 34 of 67\n(ECF No. 61, at 26, 35-38).  Plaintiffs also fairly distinguish \ntheir complaint from “the 19-page complaint in [American Freedom \nLaw  Center]”  and  emphasize  that  the  only  evidence  offered  to \nsupport  causation  in  American  Freedom  Law  Center  was  a  single \nrate filing (that may not have applied to the plaintiffs’ plan \nat all and was contradicted by subsequent filings).  (Id., at \n37–38). \n  Defendants’  second  argument  is  more  compelling  but  still \nunavailing.    Here,  Defendants  distinguish  between  standing  to \nassert the APA claim and standing to assert the Take Care Clause \nclaim.  Defendants contend that Plaintiffs’ factual allegations \nregarding the APA claim predate the 2019 Rule.  (ECF No. 92, at \n10–15 (“[C]hanges that occurred before the 2019 Rule went into \neffect  cannot  be  attributed  to  the  challenged  aspects  of  the \n2019  Rule.”)).    For  the  Individual  Plaintiffs,  Defendants \ncontend  that  “the  2019  Rule  could  not  have  affected  the \n \n  \n“Executive Order No. 13,813 will open doors \nfor  young  and  healthy  people  to  flee  the \nACA-compliant  market,  i.e.,  the  exchanges, \nand  find  lower  premiums  off  of  the \nexchanges.    Because  on-exchange  purchasers \nwill  as  a  group  be  older  and  sicker  than \nthey have been in prior years, premiums for \non-exchange purchasers will increase.  This \nwill  lead  to  decreased  enrollments  in  ACA-\ncompliant  plans,  particularly  among  the \nyoung  and  healthy.    The  Order  will  thereby \nincrease costs and decrease coverage[.]” \n \n(ECF No. 44, ¶ 110 (alterations and quotation marks omitted). \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 35 of 67\n[I]ndividual  Plaintiffs’  premiums  at  all  prior  to  2019  (since \npremiums for the new plan year would not have taken effect until \nJanuary  2019).”    (Id.,  at  14).    For  the  City  Plaintiffs, \nDefendants  contend  that  they  failed  to  show  “that  each \nchallenged aspect of the 2019 Rule will be a substantial factor \nin  the  increased  premiums  and  decreased  enrollments  that  they \npredict, [and] also that those increased premiums and decreased \nenrollments will shift costs onto the City Plaintiffs.”  (Id., \nat  15  (citations  and  quotation  marks  omitted).    Contrary  to \nDefendants’ assertions, Plaintiffs do “tie[]. . . the challenged \nprovisions of the 2019 Rule to increased costs, inaccessibility \nof quality coverage, and rises in the uninsured and underinsured \nrates.”  (ECF No. 61, at 31).  Plaintiffs’ opposition details \nthe amended complaint’s allegations and explains that: \neliminating  the  direct  notification \nrequirement causes individuals to lose their \npremium  tax  credits  and  drop  insurance \ncoverage, [ECF No. 44, ¶ 56]; \n \noutsourcing  plan  review  to  states  allows \nrestrictive  networks  to  flourish,  meaning \nthat  more  individuals  purchase  inadequate \ninsurance; id. ¶ 63; \n \nscaling  back  oversight  of  agents,  brokers, \nand issuers makes it harder for consumers to \nreceive  accurate  information  and  enroll  in \nthe right plan; id. ¶ 68; \n \neliminating support for standardized options \nlimits  price  competition,  thereby  raising \npremiums,  cost-sharing  payments,  and \ndeductibles; id. ¶ 74; \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 36 of 67\n \ndecreased  access  to  impartial,  in-person \nNavigators  deprives  individuals  of  the \nassistant they need to enroll; id. ¶ 79; \n \nmaking  exchanges  for  small  businesses  less \nfunctional  impedes  employers  from  enrolling \ntheir  employees  and  inhibits  price \ncompetition among issuers; id. ¶ 82; \n \nrequiring  enrollees  to  verify  their  income \nwill  deter  enrollment,  particularly  among \nhealthy  individuals,  which  will  thereby \nincrease premiums; id. ¶¶ 85–86; \n \nscaling back rate review will make it easier \nfor insurers to raise premiums, causing more \nindividuals  to  forgo  insurance;  id.  ¶ 93; \nand \n \nallowing  issuers  to  claim  a  set  figure  for \nquality improvement activities will make it \neasier  to  avoid  paying  rebates,  increasing \nthe  cost  of  health  care  without  increasing \nquality, id. ¶ 98. \n \n(ECF  No.  61,  at  31-32).    These  allegations  outline  the \npredictable results of the 2019 Rule. \nDefendants  contend  that  Plaintiffs’  factual  allegations \nregarding the Take Care Clause claim “fail to show that any of \nthe challenged conduct was a ‘substantial factor’ in producing \nthe harms” and “the notion that any of the challenged actions \ncould  conceivably  qualify  as  a  ‘substantial  factor’  in  issuer \ndecisions to set rates, or in consumer decisions to enroll in \nhealth  plans,  is  far-fetched.”    (ECF  No.  92,  at  16-17).  \nDefendants  try  to  bolster  their  Take  Care  Clause  argument  by \npointing to “Congress’s decision to set the penalty for failure \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 37 of 67\nto comply with the individual mandate at zero[]” as the cause of \nreduced  enrollments.”    (Id.,  at  16).    Plaintiffs  outline  the \namended complaint’s allegations “that Defendants have engaged in \na campaign to undermine the ACA comprising many discrete actions \nthat,  both  individually  and  in  combination,  make  ACA-compliant \nhealth  insurance  more  expensive,  less  effective,  and  less \naccessible.”    (ECF  No.  61,  at  32).    Plaintiffs’  allegations \nregarding  cost-sharing  reduction  payments  provide  a  useful \nexample.  They allege: \nExemplifying the Trump Administration’s \nstrategy  is  the  way  in  which  the \nAdministration,  over  the  course  of  the \nsummer  and  the  fall  in  2017,  repeatedly \nthreatened  to  discontinue  reimbursing \ninsurers  for  cost-sharing  reductions  –  to \nstop paying insurers back for the reductions \nin copayments, coinsurance, and so on, that \nthe  Act  requires  them  to  provide  to \nconsumers  .  .  .  [T]he  Administration’s \nactions,  aimed  toward  provoking  a \nlegislative  repeal,  were  deliberately \ndesigned  to  introduce  uncertainty  into  the \nexchanges  through  threats  that  the  CSR \npayments  would  cease.    As  the  President \nhimself  asserted  .  .  .  “If  you  don’t  make \nthem, [the ACA exchange] fails.” \n \nThe  threats  served  their  purpose.  \nThroughout  the  country,  some  insurers  that \nhad previously sold health insurance through \nthe exchanges for the 2017 plan year exited \nthem  entirely,  refusing  to  offer  coverage \nfor  the  2018  plan  year  because  of  the \nAdministration’s  refusal  to  guarantee  that \nCSR payments would continue.  That left some \ncounties  with  decreased  competition  among \nissuers, which (again) drives up prices and \ndecreases  overall  enrollment.    Indeed,  at \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 38 of 67\nthe  time,  the  Congressional  Budget  Office \nwarned  that  terminating  CSR  payments  could \nincrease the percentage of people living in \nareas not served by a single insurer between \n2018  and  2020.    Other  insurers  raised \npremiums by as much as 23 percent for 2018 \nto  guard  against  the  risk  that  they  would \nnot receive the payments . . . \n \nTellingly,  the  Trump  Administration \nultimately  stopped  making  CSR  payments  on \nOctober  12,  2017,  shortly  after  the \nreconciliation  instruction  for  legislation \nto repeal and replace the ACA expired . . . \nSome  insurers  and  insurance  commissioners \nadjusted  to  the  Administration’s  action  by \nraising premiums rather than pulling out of \nthe exchanges entirely. \n \n(ECF  No.  44,  ¶¶  105-107).    Plaintiffs  fairly  tie  Defendants’ \nactions  to  the  harm  alleged  in  their  Take  Care  Clause  claim.  \nMoreover, while Defendants attempt to blame decreased enrollment \non  Congress’s  reduction  of  the  individual  mandate  to  zero, \nPlaintiffs allege that “promoting and expanding access to non-\nACA  compliant  plans  causes  individuals,  particularly  healthy \nindividuals,  to  leave  the  marketplace[]”  and  that  “threatening \n[not to] enforce the individual mandate and expanding exemptions \nsimilarly caused individuals, particularly healthy individuals, \nto  leave  the  marketplace,  driving  up  premiums  for  those  that \nremained.”  (ECF No. 61, at 32 (citing ECF No. 44, ¶¶ 110–22).  \nDefendants’  actions  need  not  be  “the  sole  or  even  immediate \ncause  of  the  injury.”    Sierra  Club  v.  U.S.  Dep’t  of  the \nInterior,  899  F.3d  260,  284  (4th  Cir.  2018).    Plaintiffs \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 39 of 67\nsufficiently allege that Defendants’ actions underlying the Take \nCare Clause claim caused their asserted harm. \n  For an injury to be redressable, “it must be likely, and \nnot  merely  speculative,  that  a  favorable  decision  will  remedy \nthe  injury.”    Friends  of  the  Earth,  Inc.  v.  Gaston  Copper \nRecycling Corp., 204 F.3d 149, 154 (4th Cir. 2000).  The parties \nlargely  rely  on  their  traceability  arguments  to  advance  their \nredressability positions.  See supra n.11.  Defendants elaborate \nthat the court “cannot compel a health plan issuer to maintain a \ncertain  premium  rate  level[]”  and  that  invalidating  the \nchallenged  actions  would  not  “necessarily  lead  to  any  rate \ndecreases . . . because a health plan issuer has the discretion \nto establish premium rates in a manner deemed appropriate by the \nissuer  within  the  broad  parameters  set  by  federal  and  state \nlaws.”    (ECF  No.  52-1,  at  31).    Plaintiffs  counter  that  the \ncourt  “need  not  compel  issuers  to  set  rates  at  a  particular \nlevel;  a  favorable  decision  would  abate  Defendants’  ongoing \nattempts to undermine the ACA, curbing actions that issuers have \ncited as reasons for their high premiums, and thereby redressing \nthe  Individual  Plaintiffs’  injuries.”    (ECF  No.  61,  at  38).  \nDefendants’ argument that Plaintiffs’ injury cannot be redressed \nbecause it is dependent on third party actions and speculative, \nlike  Defendants’  traceability  argument,  fails.    The  relief \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 40 of 67\nsought  here  would  redress  Plaintiffs  injuries  by  ameliorating \nthe predictable results of Defendants’ challenged actions. \nB.  Ripeness \n“The  doctrine  of  ripeness  prevents  judicial  consideration \nof  issues  until  a  controversy  is  presented  in  clean-cut  and \nconcrete form.”  Miller v. Brown, 462 F.3d 312, 318–19 (4th Cir. \n2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The ripeness inquiry \nrequires  courts  to  “‘balance  the  fitness  of  the  issues  for \njudicial  decision  with  the  hardship  to  the  parties  of \nwithholding  court  consideration.’”    Lansdowne  on  the  Potomac \nHomeowners Ass’n, Inc. v. OpenBand at Lansdowne, LLC, 713 F.3d \n187, 198 (4th Cir. 2013) (quoting Miller, 462 F.3d at 319).  “[A] \ncase is ‘fit for judicial decision when the issues are purely \nlegal  and  when  the  action  in  controversy  is  final  and  not \ndependent on future uncertainties.’”  Id. (quoting Miller, 462 \nF.3d at 319).  “The hardship prong is measured by the immediacy \nof the threat and the burden imposed on the [plaintiff].”  Id. \nat  199  (quoting  Charter  Fed.  Sav.  Bank  v.  Office  of  Thrift \nSupervision, 976 F.2d 203, 208–09 (4th Cir. 1992). \nDefendants  contend  that,  for  many  of  the  same  reasons \nPlaintiffs  lack  standing,  the  claims  are  not  ripe  for  review.  \nPlaintiffs,  too,  acknowledge  that  standing  and  ripeness  are \noften  congruent  issues.    Because  many  of  the  claims  are \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 41 of 67\nprimarily  legal,  and  the  alleged  hardships  are  already \noccurring, the claims are ripe. \nIV.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). \nA motion to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) tests the \nsufficiency  of  the  complaint.    Presley  v.  City  of \nCharlottesville,  464  F.3d  480,  483  (4th  Cir.  2006).    In \nevaluating the complaint, unsupported legal allegations need not \nbe accepted.  Revene v. Charles Cty. Comm’rs, 882 F.2d 870, 873 \n(4th  Cir.  1989).    Legal  conclusions  couched  as  factual \nallegations are insufficient, Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, \n678 (2009), as are conclusory factual allegations devoid of any \nreference  to  actual  events.    United  Black  Firefighters  of \nNorfolk  v.  Hirst,  604  F.2d  844,  847  (4th  Cir.  1979);  see  also \nFrancis  v.  Giacomelli,  588  F.3d  186,  193  (4th  Cir.  2009).  \n“[W]here the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer \nmore than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has \nalleged  –  but  it  has  not  ‘show[n]’  –  ‘that  the  pleader  is \nentitled  to  relief.’”    Iqbal,  556  U.S.  at  679  (quoting \nFed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2).  Thus, “[d]etermining whether a complaint \nstates a plausible claim for relief will . . . be a context-\nspecific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its \njudicial experience and common sense.”  Id. \nIt is axiomatic that, “[g]enerally, when a defendant moves \nto dismiss a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6), courts are limited \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 42 of 67\nto considering the sufficiency of allegations set forth in the \ncomplaint and the ‘documents attached or incorporated into the \ncomplaint.’” Zak v. Chelsea Therapeutics Int’l, Ltd., 780 F.3d \n597, 606 (4th Cir. 2015) (quoting E.I. du Pont Nemours & Co. v. \nKolon Indus., Inc., 637 F.3d 435, 448 (4th Cir. 2011)).  Courts \nare, however, permitted to consider facts and documents subject \nto judicial notice because, under Federal Rule of Evidence 201, \ncourts “at any stage of a proceeding” may “judicially notice a \nfact that is not subject to reasonable dispute.”  Id. at 607.  \nImportantly,  “[n]evertheless,  when  a  court  considers  relevant \nfacts from the public record at the pleading stage, the court \nmust  construe  such  facts  in  the  light  most  favorable  to  the \nplaintiffs.”  Id. \nA.  APA Claim \nThe first claim in the amended complaint is for violation \nof the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706.  Under the APA, the reviewing court \nshall “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and \nconclusions  found  to  be  arbitrary,  capricious,  an  abuse  of \ndiscretion or otherwise not in accordance with law[.]” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A).    Plaintiffs  contend  that  all  of  the  2019  Rule’s \nchallenged  provisions  are  arbitrary  and  capricious  and  that \nseveral of the 2019 Rule’s challenged provisions are contrary to \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 43 of 67\nlaw.    Defendants  disagree.13    As  will  be  discussed  infra, \nDefendants’ arbitrary and capricious challenge is premature and \nalthough  the  contrary  to  law  challenge  is  not  necessarily \npremature,  it  is  underdeveloped.    The  parties  combined  their \narguments regarding these challenges.  The court endeavored to \ndisentangle the arguments below to allow consideration of each \nunder the appropriate framework. \n1.  Arbitrary and Capricious \nThe  arbitrary  and  capricious  standard  requires  the  agency \nto  “examine  the  relevant  data  and  articulate  a  satisfactory \nexplanation  for  its  action  including  a  ‘rational  connection \nbetween the facts found and the choice made.’”  Motor Vehicle \nMfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 \n(1983)  (quoting  Burlington  Truck  Lines  v.  United  States,  371 \n \n13 Defendants argue “[a]s an initial matter, the President \nis not subject to the APA, Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. \n788, 828, 796 (1992), and thus, this claim can only proceed as \nagainst  the  other  defendants.”    (ECF  No.  52-1,  at  38).  \nPlaintiffs do not challenge this argument in the APA section of \ntheir opposition, (ECF No. 61, at 45-64), and subsequently note \nthat “while ‘the President’s actions. . . are not reviewable for \nabuse of discretion under the APA,’ they ‘may still be reviewed \nfor constitutionality” (id., at 76 n.26 (quoting Franklin, 505 \nU.S.  at  801)).    This  observation  comports  with  the  amended \ncomplaint,  which  did  not  identify  the  President  in  Count  I.  \n(See  ECF  No.  44,  ¶  282  (“As  detailed  above,  Defendants  HHS, \nSecretary  Azar,  CMS,  and  Administrator  Verma  have  failed  to \nprovide adequate reasons, and failed to [respond adequately] to \ncomments for many provisions of the 2019 Rule, such that they \nare ‘arbitrary’ and ‘capricious.’  In addition, as also detailed \nabove, many provisions of the 2019 Rule violate the [ACA] and \ntherefore are ‘not in accordance with law.’”)). \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 44 of 67\nU.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  When reviewing the agency’s explanation, \nthe  reviewing  court  “must  ‘consider  whether  the  decision  was \nbased  on  a  consideration  of  the  relevant  factors  and  whether \nthere  has  been  a  clear  error  of  judgment.’”    State  Farm,  463 \nU.S.  at  43  (quoting  Bowman  Transp.,  Inc.  v.  Arkansas-Best \nFreight  Sys.,  Inc.,  419  U.S.  281,  285  (1974).    “[A]n  agency \ndecision is arbitrary and capricious if ‘the agency has relied \non  factors  which  Congress  has  not  intended  it  to  consider, \nentirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, \noffered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the \nevidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could \nnot be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency \nexpertise.’”    Sierra  Club,  899  F.3d  at  293  (4th  Cir.  2018) \n(quoting State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43). \nReview  under  the  arbitrary  and  capricious  standard  is \ndeferential and narrow.  Dep’t of Commerce, 139 S.Ct. at 2569.  \n“[A]  court  is  not  to  substitute  its  judgment  for  that  of  the \nagency.”    State  Farm,  463  U.S.  at  43.    Nonetheless,  the \narbitrary  and  capricious  standard  “is  not  meant  to  reduce \njudicial  review  to  a  ‘rubber-stamp’  of  agency  action.”    Ohio \nValley Envtl. Coal. v. Aracoma Coal Co., 556 F.3d 177, 192 (4th \nCir. 2009).  The reviewing court must “engage in a ‘searching \nand careful’ inquiry of the record.”  Id. (quoting Citizens to \nPres. Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 416 (1971). \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 45 of 67\nPlaintiffs allege that all of the challenged provisions of \nthe 2019 Rule are arbitrary and capricious.  As may be expected, \nmany  of  these  allegations  overlap.    Plaintiffs  contend  that \nDefendants failed to cite data or offer evidence in support of \nthe  challenged  provisions,  failed  to  respond  adequately  to \ncommenters’ concerns about the challenged provisions, failed to \nexplain  sufficiently  the  challenged  provisions  that  involved \npolicy  changes,  and  deferred  to  insufficient  state  processes.  \n(ECF  No.  44,  ¶¶  55,  62,  67,  72,  78,  81,  84,  91,  92,  97).  \nDefendants provide CMS’s reasons for implementing the challenged \nprovisions  to  demonstrate  that  they  are  not  arbitrary  and \ncapricious.    (ECF  No.  52-1,  at  38-59).    Defendants  also \nemphasize CMS’s substantial expertise and the deferential nature \nof review under the arbitrary and capricious standard. \nThese  arguments  are  premature  at  the  motion  to  dismiss \nstage in this case.  Plaintiffs argue: “[A]t this early stage of \nthe  litigation,  Defendants  have  yet  to  produce  the \nadministrative  record,  so  the  [2019  Rule]  itself  is  all  that \nPlaintiffs and the [c]ourt have to go by.  That posture alone \ncounsels in favor of permitting Plaintiffs’ claims to proceed, \nas  ‘the  [c]ourt  cannot  properly  evaluate’  whether  Defendants \n‘acted arbitrarily and capriciously’ where ‘the [c]ourt does not \nhave  a  complete  administrative  record.’”    (ECF  No.  61,  at  46 \n(quoting  Farrell  v.  Tillerson,  315  F.Supp.3d  47,  69  (D.D.C. \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 46 of 67\n2018)).    Defendants  respond  that  the  Notice  of  Proposed \nRulemaking  (“NPRM”),  the  comments  responding  to  the  NPRM,  and \nthe  Preamble  to  the  Rule  are  all  publicly  available  and \ntherefore there is no barrier to dismissal.  (ECF No. 92, at 18 \nn.9). \nBecause  of  the  sheer  number  of  administrative  appeals \narising in the District of Columbia, courts in that circuit have \nthe  most  complete  description  of  the  procedures  for  analysis.  \nIn Banner Health v. Sebelius, 797 F.Supp.2d 97, 112-13 (D.D.C. \n2011)  (footnote  omitted),  the  district  judge  outlined  the \noverall approach to an APA challenge in the District of Columbia \nCircuit: \n“[W]hen a party seeks review of agency \naction  under  the  APA,  the  district  judge \nsits  as  an  appellate  tribunal.”  Am. \nBioscience Inc. v. Thompson, 269 F.3d 1077, \n1083 (D.C. Cir. 2001).  “The entire case is \na  question  of  law,”  and  the  “complaint, \nproperly read, actually presents no factual \nallegations, but rather only arguments about \nthe  legal  conclusion[s]  to  be  drawn  about \nthe  agency  action.”    Marshall  Cty.  Health \nCare  Auth.  v.  Shalala,  988  F.2d  1221,  1226 \n(D.C.  Cir.  1993).    Therefore,  the  question \nis  not  whether  the  plaintiff  has  “raised \ngenuine  issues  of  material  fact,”  but \nwhether, “based on the agency record[,] . . \n.  the  agency  acted  arbitrarily  or \ncapriciously.”    Rempfer  v.  Sharfstein,  583 \nF.3d  860,  865  (D.C.  Cir.  2009)  (citing  5 \nU.S.C. § 706), cert. denied sub nom. Rempfer \nv.

[See  Dist.  Hosp. \nPartners,  L.P.  v.  Sebelius,  794  F.Supp.2d \n162,  169–72  (D.D.C.  2011)].    Moreover,  a \ncourt may generally take judicial notice of \nmaterials published in the Federal Register \nwithout  converting  the  motion  to  one  for \nsummary  judgment.    See  44  U.S.C.  §  1507 \n(“The contents of the Federal Register shall \nbe judicially noticed.”). \n \nNevertheless,  in  recognition  of  the \ndangers  associated  with  proceeding  with \njudicial  review  “on  the  basis  of  a  partial \nand truncated record” without the consent of \nthe parties, Nat.

Hosp. Partners, 794 F.Supp.2d at 171.  The situation is \nthe same here.  The court declines to examine a truncated record \nin evaluating this claim. \n2.  Contrary to Law \n“When a challenger asserts that an agency action conflicts \nwith the language of a statute, [the reviewing court] generally \nappl[ies]  the  two-step  analytical  framework  set  forth  in \nChevron, U.S.A., Inc. v.

Citibank (South Dakota), N.A., 517 U.S. 735, \n739 (1996) (alteration omitted)). \nPlaintiffs  allege  that  the  first  challenged  provision  of \nthe  2019  Rule,  relating  to  the  elimination  of  the  direct \nnotification  requirement  before  denying  APTC  for  failure  to \nreconcile, “conflicts with express statutory language requiring \nthat any eligible individual be allowed to claim APTC.”  (ECF \nNo. 44, ¶ 54).  The Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) provides the \nexpress  statutory  language  on  which  Plaintiffs  rely:  “In  the \ncase  of  an  applicable  taxpayer,  there  shall  be  allowed  as  a \ncredit against the tax imposed . . . for any taxable year an \namount  equal  to  the  premium  assistance  credit  amount  of  the \ntaxpayer for the taxpayer year.”  26 U.S.C. § 36B(a).  “The term \n‘applicable taxpayer’ means, with respect to any taxable year, a \ntaxpayer whose household income for the taxable year equals or \nexceeds 100 percent but does not exceed 400 percent of an amount \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 50 of 67\nequal to the poverty line for a family of the size involved.”  \n26  U.S.C.  §  36B(c)(1)(A).    Plaintiffs  contend:  “Whether  an \nindividual has reconciled her APTC has no bearing on whether she \nis  an  ‘applicable  taxpayer’  under  the  statute.    Therefore, \ndepriving  an  ‘applicable  taxpayer’  of  the  credit  that  the \nstatute says ‘shall be allowed’ based on a failure to reconcile \n. . . violates the plain language of the statute.”  (ECF No. 44, \n¶ 54).  Defendants argue that the IRC provision “is not under \nthe jurisdiction of CMS,” and regardless, “there is no conflict \nbetween  the  challenged  provision  and  § 36B  of  the  IRC  because \nnothing in the challenged provision deprives an individual from \nreceiving APTC as long as she or he complies with the statutory \nand regulatory eligibility requirements.”  (ECF No. 52-1, at 49-\n50).  In other words, the challenged provision “does not address \ntaxpayers’  eligibility”  but  instead  “governs  when  an  Exchange \nwill make advance payments of those tax credits directly to a \nhealth plan on behalf of an Exchange enrollee.”  (ECF No. 92, at \n20).    Plaintiffs  respond  by  highlighting  Defendants’  lack  of \n“authority  for  the  .  .  .  proposition  that  agency  regulations \nmust only comply with statutes that the agency administers,” and \nby  emphasizing  that  “where  there  is  a  conflict  between  a \nregulation and a statute . . . the statute controls regardless \nof where it is codified[.]”14  (ECF No. 61, at 48). \n \n14 Plaintiffs also note that the challenged provision raises \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 51 of 67\nPlaintiffs  allege  that  the  second  challenged  provision  of \nthe 2019 Rule, relating to outsourcing to the states compliance \nreview  of  federal  plans,  “conflicts  with  express  statutory \nlanguage  .  .  .  that  requires  the  federal  government,  as  the \nadministrator  of  federally-facilitated  exchanges,  to  certify \nplans  proffered  by  insurers  as  [QHPs.]”    (ECF  No.  44,  ¶ 60).  \nPlaintiffs contend that “[i]nterpreting the statute to prohibit \nCMS’s  decision  to  rubber-stamp  states’  review  of  network \nadequacy for federally-facilitated exchanges is also consistent \nwith the Act’s purpose.”  (Id., ¶ 61).  Plaintiffs rely on the \nACA’s  language  that  HHS  “shall,  by  regulation,  establish \ncriteria  for  the  certification  of  health  plans  as  [QHPs,]”  42 \nU.S.C.  § 18031(c)(1),  including  criteria  that  ensure  network \nadequacy, and that, pursuant to those criteria, “[a]n Exchange \nshall,  at  a  minimum[,]  implement  procedures  for  the \ncertification,  recertification,  and  decertification  .  .  .  of \nhealth plans as [QHPs,]” 42 U.S.C. § 18031(d)(4)(A).  Defendants \ncontend that the challenged provision “falls well within CMS’s \nauthority to promulgate regulations” under § 18031(c)(1).  (ECF \nNo. 52-1, at 56).  Defendants argue that § 18031(d)(4) “does not \nrequire CMS . . . to conduct the QHP certification process or \n \n“significant  due  process  concerns.”    (ECF  No.  61,  at  47;  see \nalso  ECF  No.  44,  ¶  55  (“[T]he  direct  notice  requirement  was \nadded to the failure to reconcile provision in 2016 in response \nto  concerns  that  denying  APTCs  without  direct  notice  would \nviolate due process.”)). \n51 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 52 of 67\nassess network adequacy itself[]” and “the challenged provision \ndoes  what  § 18031(d)(4)  requires:  implementing  a  procedure  for \nFFE  QHP  certification  –  one  that  relies  on  [s]tates’ \nprocesses[.]”    (Id.,  at  55-56).    Plaintiffs  respond  that  the \nACA’s “repeated use of the term ‘shall’ makes plain that these \nare  mandatory  duties[]”  and  that  “CMS  does  not  ‘implement \nprocedures for . . . certification’ by leaving certification to \nothers.”  (ECF No. 61, at 50). \nPlaintiffs  allege  that  the  fifth  challenged  provision, \nrelating  to  changes  to  the  Navigator  program,  “is  contrary  to \nlaw  because  it  permits  entities  to  qualify  as  Navigators  that \ncannot satisfy the relevant statutory criteria.”  (ECF No. 44, \n¶ 76).    Plaintiffs  identify  those  criteria  as:  (1)  conducting \n“public  education  activities  to  raise  awareness  of  the \navailability  of  [QHPs],”  42  U.S.C.  18031(i)(3)(A);  (2) \ndistributing  “fair  and  impartial  information  concerning \nenrollment  in  [QHPs],  and  the  availability  of  premium  tax \ncredits . . . and cost-sharing reductions,” id. 18031(i)(3)(B); \n(3) facilitating “enrollment in [QHPs],” id. 18031(i)(3)(C); (4) \nproviding  “enrollees  with  grievances,  complaints,  or  questions \nabout their health plans with referrals to specified entities,” \nid. 18031(i)(3)(D); and (5) providing “information in a manner \nthat is culturally and linguistically appropriate to the needs \nof  the  population  being  served  by  the  Exchange  or  Exchanges,” \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 53 of 67\nid. 18031(i)(3)(E).  (ECF No. 44, ¶ 76).  Defendants argue that \n“the ACA does not require Navigators to have a physical presence \nin  the  Exchange’s  service  area,  nor  mandate  a  two-Navigator \nminimum  for  every  Exchange[]”  but  rather  “sets  forth  broader \nrequirements for Navigators.”  (ECF No. 92, at 27).  Defendants \nconclude  that  absent  any  statutory  directive,  “the  same \nstatutory  authority  that  allowed  CMS  to  establish  the  prior \nstandards for Navigator certification now allows CMS to modify \nthose standards.”15  (ECF No. 52-1, at 46 (citation omitted)). \nPlaintiffs  allege  that  the  sixth  challenged  provision, \nregarding  the  removal  of  certain  requirements  for  SHOP \nexchanges,  is  contrary  to  law  because  “the  removal  of  these \nrequirements  permits  SHOPs  that  cannot  fulfill  their  statutory \nduties  .  .  .  which  violates  the  ACA’s  text.”    (ECF  No.  44, \n¶ 81).    This  argument  is  similar  to  Plaintiffs’  argument \nregarding the Navigator program.  Defendants argue that the ACA \ndoes not require SHOPs “to perform the functions removed by the \nnew rule.”  (ECF No. 52-1, at 53).  In their reply, Defendants \ncontend that Plaintiffs failed to contest this argument in their \nopposition and therefore have abandoned any claim that the SHOP \nchanges are contrary to law.  (ECF No. 92, at 28-29).  Despite \n \n15 Defendants also argue the 2019 Rule improves flexibility \nfor  Exchanges  because  despite  eliminating  the  requirements, \nExchanges  could  nonetheless  choose  Navigators  that  comply  with \nthem.  (ECF No. 92, at 27). \n53 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 54 of 67\nDefendants’ characterization, Plaintiffs’ opposition argues that \nthe  changes  “permit  SHOPS  to  operate  even  where  they  cannot \npossibly meet the ACA’s command that they ‘make available [QHPs] \nto qualified individuals and qualified employers’” and therefore \n“undercuts the ACA’s purpose.”  (ECF No. 61, at 56). \nPlaintiffs  allege  that  part  of  the  eighth  challenged \nprovision, regarding the exemption of student health plans from \nrate review, is contrary to the text of the ACA.  (ECF No. 44, \n¶ 90).    Plaintiffs  explain  that  “the  ACA  requires  review  of \n‘unreasonable  increases  in  premiums  for  health  insurance \ncoverage,’  42  U.S.C.  § 300gg-94(a)(1),  which  are  defined  as \n‘benefits consisting of medical care,’ id. § 300gg-91(b)(1) – a \nterm that encompasses student health plans, which . . . provide \nmedical  care  benefits  like  any  other  health  insurance  plan.”  \n(ECF No. 44, ¶ 90).   “[T]he only exceptions to rate review are \nfor  ‘excepted  benefits’  and  ‘grandfathered  health  plan’ \ncoverage, both of which are mandated by statute, see 42 U.S.C. \n§§ 300gg-91(c), 18011, and for large group plan rates, which are \nnegotiated  on  a  group-by-group  basis  and  therefore  cannot  be \neffectively reviewed.”  (ECF No. 44, ¶ 90).  Defendants discuss \n42 U.S.C. § 18118(c), and argue that “CMS has long interpreted \nthe  ACA  to  exclude  student  health  insurance  plans  from  ACA \nrequirements that ‘would have, as a practical matter, the effect \nof prohibiting an institution of higher education from offering \n54 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 55 of 67\na student health plan otherwise permitted under federal, state, \nor local law.”  (ECF No. 52-1, at 39).  Defendants offer three \nexamples  of  exemptions  for  student  health  plans  under \n§ 18118(c): (1) student health plans are exempt “from the ACA’s \nguaranteed  availability  and  renewability  requirements  to  the \nextent  that  such  requirements  would  require  a  student  health \ninsurance  plan  to  accept  enrollment  or  renew  coverage  of \nindividuals who are not students or dependents of students[;]” \n(2)  student  health  plans  may  offer  coverage  based  on  the \nacademic year, rather than the calendar year; and (3) “student \nhealth  insurance  coverage  is  not  included  in  the  ACA’s \nindividual market single risk pool in a State because issuers of \nstudent  health  insurance  coverage  typically  contract  with \ncolleges  and  universities  to  issue  a  blanket  health  insurance \npolicy[.]”    (Id.,  at  40).    Plaintiffs  question  Defendants’ \ninvocation  of  § 18118(c)  and  proffer  of  these  three  examples: \n“CMS did not invoke § 18118 in the 2019 Rule itself – let alone \narticulate  this  novel  rationale  –  and  Defendants  cannot  do  so \nnow.”  (ECF No. 61, at 60). \nFinally,  Plaintiffs  allege  that  the  ninth  challenged \nprovision, “allowing insurers to claim a flat credit for quality \nimprovement  activities  [when  calculating  MLR],  is  contrary  to \nthe text of the ACA.”  (ECF No. 44, ¶ 96).  Plaintiffs contend \nthat  the  ACA  “requires  insurers  to  report  the  amount  actually \n55 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 56 of 67\nspent  on  QIA[.]”  (Id.  (discussing  42  U.S.C.  § 300gg-18(a)(1)).  \nThey argue that the ACA “does not permit CMS to . . . throw up \nits  hands  and  give  every  insurer  the  same  credit  [for  QIA], \nwhether  or  not  the  funds  are  actually  expended.”    (Id.).  \nDefendants  argue  that  § 300gg-18(a)(2)  “directs  insurers  to \nreport  ‘the  percentage  of  total  premium  revenue,  after \naccounting for collections or receipts for risk adjustments and \nrisk corridors and payments of reinsurance, that such coverage \nexpends . . . for [QIA].’”  (ECF No. 52-1, at 58).  Defendants \nconclude  that  “[b]y  its  express  terms,  the  statute  does  not \nrequire  issuers  to  provide  an  itemized  list  of  each  QIA \nexpenditure that contributes to the calculation of the MLR; the \nitemized method was imposed only by regulation.”  (Id.). \nPure matters of law may be resolved on a motion to dismiss \nand,  at  times,  determining  whether  an  agency’s  actions  are \ncontrary to law presents such a question of law.  See, e.g. King \nv. Burwell, 759 F.3d. 358, 367-376 (4th Cir. 2014), aff'g King v. \nSebelius,  997  F.Supp.2d  415  (E.D.Va.  2014), aff'd,  135  S.Ct. \n2480 (2015).  Of course, the issue can also be resolved on a \nmotion  for  summary  judgment.    Defendants’  arguments  are \ninsufficiently developed to demonstrate that Plaintiffs’ claims \nwould  fail  under  the  Chevron  standard.    See  Farrell,  315 \nF.Supp.3d  at  65-68.    Defendants  appear  to  raise  both  Chevron \nstep one and Chevron step two arguments but do not clearly apply \n56 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 57 of 67\nthe Chevron analysis.  The United States Court of Appeals for \nthe Fourth Circuit explained the framework: \nAt Chevron’s first step, a court looks to the “plain \nmeaning” of the statute to determine if the regulation \nresponds  to  it.    Chevron,  467  U.S.  at  842-43,  104 \nS.Ct.  2778.    If  it  does,  that  is  the  end  of  the \ninquiry and the regulation stands.  Id.  However, if \nthe  statute  is  susceptible  to  multiple \ninterpretations,  the  court  then  moves  to  Chevron’s \nsecond step and defers to the agency’s interpretation \nso long as it is based on a permissible construction \nof the statute.  Id. at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778. \n \nKing, 759 F.3d at 367.  “The objective of Chevron step one is \nnot to interpret and apply the statute to resolve a claim, but \nto  determine  whether  Congress’s  intent  in  enacting  it  was  so \nclear as to foreclose any other interpretation.”  Id.  “Courts \nshould  employ  all  the  traditional  tools  of  statutory \nconstruction  in  determining  whether  Congress  has  clearly \nexpressed  its  intent  regarding  the  issue  in  question.”    Id.  \nDefendants  here  attempt  “to  interpret  and  apply”  the  ACA  but \nthey fail to grapple with Congress’s intent. \nMoreover,  the  parties  combined  their  arbitrary  and \ncapricious  arguments  with  their  contrary  to  law  arguments.  \nBecause all of the provisions challenged as contrary to law are \nalso challenged as arbitrary and capricious, the court will not \nresolve the contrary to law arguments separately now. \n\t  \n57 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 58 of 67\nB.  Take Care Clause Claim \nThe second claim in the amended complaint is for violation \nof the “Take Care Clause,” U.S. Const. art II, § 3.  Plaintiffs \nassert that the court “has authority to issue ‘equitable relief \n[to] prevent[] entities from acting unconstitutionally.’”  (ECF \nNo. 44, ¶ 14) (quoting Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Accounting \nOversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 491 n.2 (2010)). \nThe  viability  of  the  “Take  Care  Clause”  as  a  stand-alone \ncause of action is, to put it lightly, uncertain.  No court in \nthis circuit, or any other circuit, has definitively found that \nthe “Take Care Clause” provides a private cause of action which \na plaintiff may bring against the President of the United States \nor his administration.  Arguably the closest any court has come \nto doing so is the D.C. Circuit in National Treasury Employees \nUnion v. Nixon, 492 F.2d 587 (D.C. Cir. 1974).  In that case, \nthe  D.C.  Circuit  issued  broad  dicta  about  the  constitutional \nimplications of the Take Care Clause, specifically noting that \nthe constitutional duty arising from the Take Care Clause “does \nnot  permit  the  President  to  refrain  from  executing  laws  duly \nenacted by the Congress[.]”  Nixon, 492 F.2d at 604. \nCritically,  though,  Nixon  did  not  involve  a  freestanding \ncause  of  action  brought  under  the  Take  Care  Clause.    Rather, \nPlaintiffs in that case asserted claims for mandamus pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. § 1361 and declaratory relief pursuant to the Federal \n58 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 59 of 67\nDeclaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201.  The court in Nixon \nheld that it had subject matter jurisdiction under the former, \nand the alternative power to issue declaratory relief pursuant \nto  the  latter.    Section  1361  grants  district  courts  “original \njurisdiction of any action in the nature of mandamus to compel \nan  officer  or  employee  of  the  United  States  or  any  agency \nthereof  to  perform  a  duty  owed  to  the  plaintiff.”    28  U.S.C.    \n§  1361.    The  court  ultimately  issued  a  declaratory  judgment \nagainst President Nixon declaring that “that the President has a \nconstitutional duty forthwith to grant, effective as of October, \n1972,  the  federal  pay  increase  mandated  by  the  Congress  and \nsought by NTEU herein so that the members of NTEU can collect \nwhat has been due them for many months.”   Nixon, 492 F.2d at \n616.   \nWhile  the  D.C.  Circuit  did  find  that  the  President’s \n“constitutional duty” to implement a federal pay increase arose \nfrom the Take Care Clause, it did not find that the Take Care \nClause creates a federal cause of action.  Indeed, even though \nthe existence of such a cause of action was not directly before \nthe court, the D.C. Circuit was still careful to limit itself to \na declaratory judgment only, refusing to issue an injunction or \nwrit  of  mandamus.    The  court  stated  that  “[w]e  so  restrict \nourselves at this time in order to show the utmost respect to \nthe office of the Presidency and to avoid, if at all possible, \n59 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 60 of 67\ndirect  involvement  by  the  Courts  in  the  President's \nconstitutional duty faithfully to execute the laws and any clash \nbetween the judicial and executive branches of the Government.”  \nId. (emphasis added).   \nTo understand the D.C. Circuit’s reluctance to so involve \nitself, the court must look back to Mississippi v. Johnson, 71 \nU.S. 475 (1866), the clearest statement the Supreme Court of the \nUnited  States  has  given  on  the  Take  Care  Clause.    There,  the \nstate of Mississippi sought to force President Andrew Johnson, \nby  writ  of  mandamus,  to  “faithfully  execute”  portions  of  a \nseries  of  Reconstruction  Acts.    The  Supreme  Court  refused, \ncontrasting  a  series  of  earlier  cases  where  courts  had  issued \nwrits of mandamus to lower executive branch officials: \nA ministerial duty, the performance of \nwhich  may,  in  proper  cases,  be  required  of \nthe  head  of  a  department,  by  judicial \nprocess, is one in respect to which nothing \nis  left  to  discretion.  It  is  a  simple, \ndefinite  duty,  arising  under  conditions \nadmitted or proved to exist, and imposed by \nlaw. \n \nThe  case  of  Marbury  v.  Madison, \nSecretary  of  State,  furnishes  an \nillustration. A citizen had been nominated, \nconfirmed,  and  appointed  a  justice  of  the \npeace for the District of Columbia, and his \ncommission  had  been  made  out,  signed,  and \nsealed.  Nothing  remained  to  be  done  except \ndelivery,  and  the  duty  of  delivery  was \nimposed by law on the Secretary of State. It \nwas  held  that  the  performance  of  this  duty \nmight be enforced by mandamus issuing from a \ncourt having jurisdiction. \n60 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 61 of 67\n \nSo, in the case of Kendall, Postmaster-\nGeneral,  v.  Stockton  &  Stokes,  an  act  of \nCongress had directed the Postmaster-General \nto  credit  Stockton  &  Stokes  with  such  sums \nas the Solicitor of the Treasury should find \ndue  to  them;  and  that  officer  refused  to \ncredit them with certain sums, so found due. \nIt was held that the crediting of this money \nwas a mere ministerial duty, the performance \nof which might be judicially enforced. \n \nIn each of these cases nothing was left \nto  discretion.  There  was  no  room  for  the \nexercise  of  judgment.  The  law  required  the \nperformance  of  a  single  specific  act;  and \nthat  performance,  it  was  held,  might  be \nrequired by mandamus. \n \nVery  different  is  the  duty  of  the \nPresident  in  the  exercise  of  the  power  to \nsee  that  the  laws  are  faithfully  executed, \nand among these laws the acts named in the \nbill.  By  the  first  of  these  acts  he  is \nrequired  to  assign  generals  to  command  in \nthe  several  military  districts,  and  to \ndetail  sufficient  military  force  to  enable \nsuch  officers  to  discharge  their  duties \nunder  the  law.  By  the  supplementary  act, \nother  duties  are  imposed  on  the  several \ncommanding  generals,  and  these  duties  must \nnecessarily  be  performed  under  the \nsupervision  of  the  President  as  commander-\nin-chief.  The  duty  thus  imposed  on  the \nPresident  is  in  no  just  sense  ministerial. \nIt is purely executive and political. \n \nJohnson, 71 U.S. at 498-99. \nThe  distinction  which  the  Court  in  Johnson  created  was \nbetween  “ministerial”  duties  and  “executive  and  political” \nduties.  The former could be enforced, by mandamus, on executive \nbranch officials – and perhaps, though not clearly so, even on \n61 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 62 of 67\nthe President – while the latter were beyond the purview of the \ncourts.  The D.C. Circuit in Nixon explained this distinction as \none  that  turns  on  the  amount  of  discretion  afforded  to  the \nexecutive branch:  “‘If the law direct him to perform an act in \nregard to which no discretion is committed to him, and which, \nupon the facts existing, he is bound to perform, then that act \nis ministerial[.]’”  Nixon, 492 F.2d at 602 (quoting Roberts v. \nUnited States ex rel. Valentine, 176 U.S. 219, 231 (1900), and \nciting  to  Wilbur  v.  United  States  ex  rel.  Krushnic,  280  U.S. \n306, 318-19 (1930)).  The court in Nixon went on to hold that it \n“possesses  the  authority  to  mandamus  the  President  to  perform \nthe ministerial duty involved herein[.]” Id. at 616.  That duty \nwas  the  putting  into  effect  of  a  Congressionally  mandated  pay \nraise for the plaintiffs.  Id. at 595.  Critically, the court \nfound  that  issuing  a  declaratory  judgment  on  the  President’s \nobligation to effect the pay raise would “not require any court \nsupervision  over  the  performance  of  duty  by  the  executive \nbranch.”  Id. at 605.  \nDespite  this  cautious  history,  Plaintiffs  blithely  assert \nthat this court has jurisdiction and they enjoy a right to sue \ndirectly under the Take Care Clause.  Plaintiffs argue that: \nFaced  with  the  strikingly  similar \n“assert[ion] that [the plaintiffs] have not \npointed to any case in which this Court has \nrecognized  an  implied  private  right  of \naction  directly  under  the  Constitution  to \n62 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 63 of 67\nchallenge  governmental  action  under  .  .  . \nseparation-of-powers  principles,”  the \nSupreme Court rejected it, reaffirming that \n“equitable  relief  has  long  been  recognized \nas the proper means for preventing entities \nfrom acting unconstitutionally.”   \n \n(ECF No. 61, at 77 (quoting Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 491 \nn.2)).  Reliance on Free Enterprise Fund, however, is misplaced.  \nThe Court there held that “the dual for-cause limitations on the \nremoval  of  [certain  executive  branch  officials]  contravene  the \nConstitution’s  separation  of  powers.”    Free  Enter.  Fund,  561 \nU.S. at 492. \nThat holding did stem in part from the Take Care Clause: \nthe Court noted that “[i]t is [the President’s] responsibility \nto  take  care  that  the  laws  be  faithfully  executed.    The  buck \nstops with the President, in Harry Truman's famous phrase . . . \n[T]he  President  therefore  must  have  some  ‘power  of  removing \nthose for whom he can not continue to be responsible.’”  Id. at \n493.  In other words, the Court found unconstitutional an act of \nCongress which purported to tie the president’s hands regarding \nhis  duties  under  the  Take  Care  Clause.    Under  those \ncircumstances,  the  court  agreed  with  the  plaintiffs  that \nequitable relief was a proper remedy.  That equitable relief was \nto  take  the  form  of  “declaratory  relief  sufficient  to  ensure \nthat the reporting requirements and auditing standards to which \nthey  are  subject  will  be  enforced  only  by  a  constitutional \n63 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 64 of 67\nagency  accountable  to  the  Executive.”    Id.  at  513.    In  other \nwords,  the  court  rightly  held  that  it  could  issue  equitable \nrelief in the form of a declaration that certain aspects of an \nAct  of  Congress  were  unconstitutional,  in  part  because  of \nseparation of powers issues stemming from the Take Care Clause.   \nThe Court in Free Enterprise Fund was, of course, right to \nuphold the bedrock Constitutional Law principle that courts may \nutilize  equitable  relief  to  declare  Acts  of  Congress \nunconstitutional.  Id. at 491 n.2 (“[E]quitable relief ‘has long \nbeen recognized as the proper means for preventing entities from \nacting  unconstitutionally’  .  .  .  If  the  Government’s  point  is \nthat an Appointments Clause or separation-of-powers claim should \nbe treated differently than every other constitutional claim, it \noffers no reason and cites no authority why that might be so.”)  \nIn this instant case, Plaintiffs are not asking the court to 1) \nexercise its traditional powers of judicial review over an Act \nof Congress, and 2) grant equitable relief sufficient to remedy \nthe  constitutional  issue.    Rather,  Plaintiffs  are  asking  the \ncourt  to  appropriate  a  degree  of  the  discretion  left  to  the \nPresident  in  how  to  take  care  that  the  ACA  is  faithfully \nexecuted.    Here,  there  is  ample  reason  and  authority  why \nPlaintiffs’ claims should be treated differently from the type \nof claim brought in Free Enterprise Fund.   \n64 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 65 of 67\nMuch  of  the  authority  distinguishing  this  case  from  the \ncircumstances  of  Free  Enterprise  Fund  is  recent.    In  Citizens \nfor  Responsibility  and  Ethics  in  Washington  v.  Trump,  302 \nF.Supp.3d  127  (D.D.C.  2018)  (hereinafter  CREW),  the  court \ntentatively  concluded  that  “while  Johnson  may  prevent  a  court \nfrom  issuing  an  injunction  to  the  President  concerning  a \ndiscretionary duty, that case does not so clearly foreclose the \ndeclaratory  judgment  claim  at  issue  here.”    Id.  at  140.    The \nFourth Circuit has been even less circumspect in its reading of \nJohnson,  taking  that  case  and  its  progeny  to  mean  that  “‘in \ngeneral, “this court has no jurisdiction of a bill to enjoin the \nPresident  in  the  performance  of  his  official  duties.”’    Int’l \nRefugee Assistance Project v. Trump, 857 F.3d 554, 605 (4th Cir. \n2017)(en banc)(vacated as moot, 138 S. Ct. 353 (2017)) (quoting \nFranklin, 505 U.S. at 802-03). \nBased  on  this  guidance  from  the  Fourth  Circuit,  the  D.C. \nCircuit,  and  the  Supreme  Court,  Plaintiffs’  claims  for \ninjunctive  relief  pursuant  to  the  Take  Care  Clause  will  be \ndismissed.    The  only  remaining  question,  then,  is  whether \nPlaintiffs  have  stated  a  claim  for  a  declaratory  judgment \npursuant to the Take Care Clause.  Assuming, arguendo, that a \nvalid Take Care Clause cause of action exists in some form, and \nthat  a  district  court  may,  as  it  did  in  Nixon,  issue  a \ndeclaratory  judgment  against  the  President  –  neither  of  which \n65 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 66 of 67\nappears  firmly  grounded  in  precedent  or  sound  constitutional \nprinciples  –  Plaintiffs  have  nonetheless  failed  to  state  a \nclaim.    For  this  conclusion,  the  court  need  not  look  further \nthan  the  exact  declaratory  relief  Plaintiffs  seek;  they  have \nasked this court to:  \ndeclare  that  Defendants  are  violating  the \nTake Care Clause by taking executive action \nto: [(a)] suppress the number of individuals \nand  families  obtaining  health  insurance \nthrough  ACA  exchanges;  [(b)]  increase \npremiums  for  health  insurance  in  the  ACA \nexchanges;  [(c)]  diminish  the  availability \nof  comprehensive,  reasonably-priced  health \ninsurance for individuals and families with \npreexisting  conditions;  [(d)]  discourage \nindividuals  and  families  from  obtaining \nhealth insurance that provides the coverage \nthat  Congress,  in  the  ACA,  determined  is \nnecessary  to  protect  American  families \nagainst  the  physical  and  economic \ndevastation  that  results  from  lesser \ninsurance,  with  limits  on  coverage  that \nleaves them unable to cover the costs of an \naccident or unexpected illness[.] \n \n(ECF No. 44, at 144).   \n  Plainly, none of the President’s complained-of actions are \n“ministerial” in the sense developed in Johnson and Nixon.  That \nis, there is no “peremptory, and plainly defined[,]” Nixon, 492 \nF.2d  at  602,  course  of  action  the  President  could  take  to \nrectify the flaws that Plaintiffs perceive in his execution of \nthe  ACA.    Any  judgment  to  the  contrary  by  this  court  would \n“require . . . court supervision over the performance of duty by \nthe  executive  branch.”    Id.  at  605.    Plaintiffs’  Take  Care \n66 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02364-DKC   Document 102   Filed 04/10/20   Page 67 of 67\nClause cause of action fails for the same reason stated by the \ndistrict court in its recent decision in CREW: because judicial \nintervention here would impinge on the discretion that Congress \nhas  afforded  to  the  President  and  entrust  to  the  courts  the \n“executive  and  political”  duties  of  determining  how  to \n“faithfully execute” the APA.  CREW, 302 F.Supp.3d at 140 (“The \nSupreme Court has advised that “[h]ow the President chooses to \nexercise the discretion Congress has granted him is not a matter \nfor [the courts’] review”) (quoting Dalton v. Specter, 511 U.S. \n462, 476 (1994)); see also, In re Border Infrastructure Envtl. \nLitig., 284 F.Supp.3d 1092, 1139 (S.D.Cal. 2018) (“[A] Take Care \nchallenge in this case would essentially open the doors to an \nundisciplined and unguided review process for all decisions made \nby the Executive Department.”).
