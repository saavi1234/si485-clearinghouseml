          "description": "MINUTE ORDER, striking Defendants' Notice of Supplemental Authority. The instant case is currently stayed pending the D.C. Circuit's decision in Grace v. Barr, No. 19-5013 (D.C. Cir. 2019), pursuant to an Order of the Court that was issued on March 5, 2020. (See Minute Order of Mar. 5, 2020.) On July 7, 2020, Plaintiffs filed a 70 Notice of Supplemental Authority, which discussed various intervening precedents that, in Plaintiffs' view, bear on the present dispute and warrant reconsideration of this Court's decision to stay the instant matter. (See Notice, ECF No. 70, at 1-6.) On July 8, 2020, this Court declined to reconsider its stay order. (See Minute Order of July 8, 2020.) Defendants have subsequently filed a 71 Notice of Supplemental Authority and Response to Plaintiffs' Notice of Supplemental Authority, which primarily responds to Plaintiffs' arguments that this Court should reconsider the stay order (see Notice, ECF No. 71, at 2-7), and also briefly discusses a recent ruling that Defendants believe further supports their merits arguments in the instant dispute (see id. at 1-2). Because this Court has already declined Plaintiffs' invitation to lift the stay in this case, and because the parties will have ample opportunity to bring to the Court's attention any intervening authorities that support their respective positions on the merits of the issues in dispute once the D.C. Circuit issues its ruling in Grace and the stay in the instant matter is lifted, it is hereby ORDERED that Defendants' 71 Notice of Supplemental Authority is STRICKEN, without prejudice to Defendants' ability to re-raise the arguments therein when this Court lifts the stay in the instant matter. Signed by Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson on 07/15/2020. (lckbj2)"

          "description": "MINUTE ORDER. This Court is in receipt of Plaintiffs' 62 Motion for Leave to File Supplemental Pleading, which seeks to add supplemental allegations to Plaintiffs' 6 Amended Complaint. The proposed allegations concern an updated version of the Lesson Plan on Credible Fear of Persecution and Torture, which USCIS has issued since the filing of Plaintiffs' 6 Amended Complaint in the instant matter. Defendants filed a 58 Status Report on October 9, 2019, informing this Court that a new version of the Lesson Plan dated April 30, 2019, which is challenged in the instant civil action, was published on September 30, 2019. (See Defs.' Status Report, ECF No. 58.) The September 2019 Lesson Plan continues to display the \"April 30, 2019\" date (Ex. A to Defs.' Status Report, ECF No. 58-1, at 2), and according to Defendants, \"[t]he new, September 2019 Lesson Plan does not meaningfully address or remove any of the alleged deficiencies that Plaintiffs challenge in the April 30, 2019, Lesson Plan\" (Defs.' Status Report at 2). Defendants generally oppose Plaintiffs' request for leave to supplement their complaint to include allegations concerning the September 2019 Lesson Plan (see Defs.' Mem. in Opp'n to Pls.' Mot. to Supplement, ECF No. 64), but \"agree to Plaintiffs' supplemental pleading if the Court would order that it considers Plaintiffs to be challenging only the aspects of the September 2019 Lesson Plan that Plaintiffs have already been challenging in this case\" (id. at 3). Therefore, consistent with the parties' agreement, it is hereby ORDERED that Plaintiffs' 62 Motion for Leave to File Supplemental Pleading is GRANTED, and Plaintiffs' [62-2] Supplemented First Amended Complaint will be considered the operative complaint in the instant matter, but only to the extent that it incorporates the September 2019 version of the Lesson Plan into the 6 Amended Complaint's challenges concerning the April 2019 Lesson Plan and does not augment or change those challenges. Signed by Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson on 10/31/2020. (lckbj2)"

During this morning's teleconference, Plaintiffs' counsel proposed that the Court require the government to produce an index of any relevant documents that the agency excludes from the administrative record when it undertakes to compile the record in this case. If Plaintiffs intend to pursue this requested order, they must provide proposed language for inclusion in the Court's scheduling order concerning the production of the administrative record, and Defendant must have the opportunity to oppose any such language. Accordingly, and consistent with the representations that the Court made during the teleconference, it is hereby ORDERED that, on or before 7/10/19 at 10:00 AM, Plaintiffs shall file any motion for a withholding index or other Court order concerning compilation of the administrative record. Plaintiffs shall provide with their motion the proposed language of the requested order, which shall include deadlines for filings related to disputes regarding the content of the proposed withholding index and any other aspects of the production of the administrative record, and a memorandum of law of no more than 5 pages that identifies the legal authority for the proposed order language. It is FURTHER ORDERED that any response by Defendant to Plaintiffs' motion shall be no more than 5 pages, and shall be filed on or before 7/10/19 at 2 PM.

    "summary": "<p>On June 25, 2019, five asylum seekers from Angola, Cuba, and El Salvador filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs sued the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Attorney General under the Refugee Act, 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1158(a); Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1231(b)(3); Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture, 8 C.F.R. &sect; 208.16(c), (d); and the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. &sect; 706(2). The plaintiffs, represented by the International Refugee Assistance Program and the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, sought declarative, injunctive, and monetary relief. The plaintiffs alleged that the Trump Administration issued a set of instructions (the \"Lesson Plan\") on April 30, 2019, to asylum officers that were designed to turn back as many asylum seekers as possible. The Lesson Plan allegedly made it far more difficult for asylum seekers to pass their &ldquo;credible fear interviews.&rdquo; If an asylum seeker is found to lack &ldquo;credible fear,&rdquo; they may be unable to apply for asylum. The case was assigned to Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson.</p>\r\n<p>On August 19, 2019, the defendants moved for summary judgment. The defendants argued that the plaintiffs&rsquo; case should be dismissed because it was not a legal issue over which the court could exercise its judicial authority because there was no evidence that enjoining the Lesson Plan would remedy plaintiffs' injuries and because the Lesson Plan was not subject to judicial review under the APA. Furthermore, the defendants contended that the Lesson Plan had no real impact on the credible fear process and that it was just a minor update to account for developments in the case law.</p>\r\n<p>On September 5, 2019, the plaintiffs cross-moved for summary judgment. The plaintiffs contended that they were entitled to summary judgment on the merits because the Lesson Plan was inconsistent with the statutory and regulatory scheme of the credible fear process and was in violation of the APA. With regards to the defendants&rsquo; contention that the Lesson Plan had no real impact, the plaintiffs rebutted that the record showed a significant change to policy. Judge Jackson held a hearing on the motions for summary judgment on October 22, 2019.</p>\r\n<p>On March 5, 2020, Judge Jackson issued an order staying the case pending resolution of appeal in <em>Grace v. Barr</em>, No. 19-5013 (D.C. Cir. 2019). Judge Jackson stated that <em>Grace v. Barr</em> presented various questions regarding the meaning of terms under 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1252(e), the credible fear interview statute, such as the meaning of \"implementation,\" \"implement,\" and \"written policy directive, written policy guideline, or written procedure.\" Judge Jackson found that because similar questions of law are relevant in the current case, it should be stayed pending resolution in the D.C. Circuit. More information about <em>Grace v. Barr</em> can be found <a href=\"../../../../detail.php?id=16728\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<p>After the D.C. Circuit released its opinion in <em>Grace</em>, Judge Jackson granted plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for summary judgment and denied defendants&rsquo; motion for summary judgment on October 31, 2020. 2020 WL 6392824. Applying the Chevron deference framework, Judge Jackson concluded that USCIS unlawfully required screening officers to make credible fear determinations in a manner that is \"inconsistent with the two-stage asylum eligibility framework that the INA plainly establishe[d].\" Therefore, Judge Jackson declared that the provisions of the Lesson Plan that conflicted with the INA were unlawful. Because the unlawful parts couldn't be severed from the rest of the document, Judge Jackson vacated the entire Lesson Plan. Finally, judge Jackson enjoined the credible fear determinations previously made pursuant to the plan, and ordered that these plaintiffs be provided a new credible fear screening.</p>\r\n<p>On December 15, the defendants appealed to the D.C. Circuit Court. A week later, the plaintiffs filed a motion to enforce the court&rsquo;s earlier order.</p>\r\n<p>In mid-July 2021, the defendants filed a consent motion to dismiss the appeal. Three months later the parties agreed to proceed to mediation before Magistrate Judge Robin M. Meriweather, with mediation scheduled for March 29, 2022. Because of Judge Jackson&rsquo;s elevation to the D.C. Circuit, the case was reassigned to Judge Jia M. Cobb. A settlement conference was held on April 8, 2022. As of April 10, 2022, the case remains ongoing.</p>",

    "summary_short": "In 2019, IRAP, on the behalf of five asylum seekers, filed this complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs alleged that a set of instructions issued by the Trump administration were designed to turn back as many asylum seekers as possible and violated the credible fear process and their due process rights. The plaintiffs sought to enjoin ICE from continuing to apply these instructions during the credible fear process. On October 31, 2020, Judge Jackson granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment. The plaintiffs appealed the court's decision, but withdrew their appeal when the parties agreed to proceed with mediation. A settlement conference was held on April 8, 2022, and the case is ongoing.",

KIAKOMBUA, SOFIA (Cox, Justin) (Entered: 07/07/2020)\n07/08/2020 MINUTE ORDER. On March 5, 2020, this Court ordered that the instant matter be\nstayed pending the D.C. Circuit's decision in Grace v. Barr, No. 19−5013 (D.C. Cir.\n2019), because both Grace and the instant dispute involve similar threshold issues\nconcerning the meaning of various statutory terms under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(A).\n(See Minute Order of Mar. 5, 2020.) The Court is in receipt of Plaintiffs' 70 Notice of\nSupplemental Authority, which discusses various intervening precedents that, in\nPlaintiffs' view, bear on the present dispute. (See Notice, ECF No. 70, 1−6.) Although\nPlaintiffs have asked that this Court reconsider its decision to stay this case, the\nintervening precedents cited in Plaintiffs' Notice neither resolve nor shed any light\nupon the particular questions of law that prompted the Court to stay this matter−−i.e.,\nthe meaning of the \"implementation,\" \"implement,\" \"written policy directive,\" \"written\npolicy guideline,\" or \"written procedure\" under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(A). Because the\nappeal in Grace remains pending, and because the D.C. Circuit is likely to resolve\nissues of law that will bind this Court with respect to the resolution of the instant\ndispute, it is hereby ORDERED that the instant matter will remain STAYED pending\nthe D.C. Circuit's decision in Grace. It is FURTHER ORDERED that each party shall\nfile a supplemental memorandum of no more than 10 pages within 14 days of the D.C.\nCircuit's ruling, informing this Court of the import of that decision on the instant\ndispute.

Barr,\nNo. 19−5013 (D.C. Cir. 2019), pursuant to an Order of the Court that was issued on\nMarch 5, 2020. (See Minute Order of Mar. 5, 2020.) On July 7, 2020, Plaintiffs filed a\n70 Notice of Supplemental Authority, which discussed various intervening precedents\nthat, in Plaintiffs' view, bear on the present dispute and warrant reconsideration of this\nCourt's decision to stay the instant matter. (See Notice, ECF No. 70, at 1−6.) On July\n8, 2020, this Court declined to reconsider its stay order. (See Minute Order of July 8,\n2020.) Defendants have subsequently filed a 71 Notice of Supplemental Authority and\nResponse to Plaintiffs' Notice of Supplemental Authority, which primarily responds to\nPlaintiffs' arguments that this Court should reconsider the stay order (see Notice, ECF\nNo. 71, at 2−7), and also briefly discusses a recent ruling that Defendants believe\nfurther supports their merits arguments in the instant dispute (see id. at 1−2). Because\nthis Court has already declined Plaintiffs' invitation to lift the stay in this case, and\nbecause the parties will have ample opportunity to bring to the Court's attention any\nintervening authorities that support their respective positions on the merits of the\nissues in dispute once the D.C. Circuit issues its ruling in Grace and the stay in the\ninstant matter is lifted, it is hereby ORDERED that Defendants' 71 Notice of\nSupplemental Authority is STRICKEN, without prejudice to Defendants' ability to\nre−raise the arguments therein when this Court lifts the stay in the instant matter.\nSigned by Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson on 07/15/2020.

Plaintiffs filed this action against multiple Defendants, including\nKevin McAleenan in his official capacity as Acting Secretary of the Department of\nHomeland Security. The current Acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland\nSecurity, Chad Wolf, in his official capacity, is automatically substituted for his\npredecessor as Defendant, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.

This Court is in receipt of Plaintiffs' 62 Motion for Leave to File\nSupplemental Pleading, which seeks to add supplemental allegations to Plaintiffs' 6\nAmended Complaint. The proposed allegations concern an updated version of the\nLesson Plan on Credible Fear of Persecution and Torture, which USCIS has issued\nsince the filing of Plaintiffs' 6 Amended Complaint in the instant matter. Defendants\nfiled a 58 Status Report on October 9, 2019, informing this Court that a new version of\nthe Lesson Plan dated April 30, 2019, which is challenged in the instant civil action,\nwas published on September 30, 2019. (See Defs.' Status Report, ECF No. 58.) The\nSeptember 2019 Lesson Plan continues to display the \"April 30, 2019\" date (Ex. A to\nDefs.' Status Report, ECF No. 58−1, at 2), and according to Defendants, \"[t]he new,\nSeptember 2019 Lesson Plan does not meaningfully address or remove any of the\n\nalleged deficiencies that Plaintiffs challenge in the April 30, 2019, Lesson Plan\"\n(Defs.' Status Report at 2). Defendants generally oppose Plaintiffs' request for leave to\nsupplement their complaint to include allegations concerning the September 2019\nLesson Plan (see Defs.' Mem. in Opp'n to Pls.' Mot. to Supplement, ECF No. 64), but\n\"agree to Plaintiffs' supplemental pleading if the Court would order that it considers\nPlaintiffs to be challenging only the aspects of the September 2019 Lesson Plan that\nPlaintiffs have already been challenging in this case\" (id. at 3). Therefore, consistent\nwith the parties' agreement, it is hereby ORDERED that Plaintiffs' 62 Motion for\nLeave to File Supplemental Pleading is GRANTED, and Plaintiffs' [62−2]\nSupplemented First Amended Complaint will be considered the operative complaint in\nthe instant matter, but only to the extent that it incorporates the September 2019\nversion of the Lesson Plan into the 6 Amended Complaint's challenges concerning the\nApril 2019 Lesson Plan and does not augment or change those challenges.

This is a case about upholding the American commitment to treat fairly the asylum \nclaims of people who arrive at our borders fleeing persecution and violence. In yet another attempt \nto circumvent this codified and consistently reified commitment, on April 30, 2019 the Trump \nAdministration issued a new set of instructions (the \"Lesson Plan\") to the hundreds of asylum \nofficers who have the life-and-death responsibility of screening out those baseless claims for \nhumanitarian protection from the rest.  Rather than making a good-faith effort to administer the \nsystem Congress designed, the Administration issued a biased, error-filled set of instructions \ndesigned to turn back as many asylum seekers as possible, in violation of the Immigration and \nNationality  Act  (\"INA\"),  the  Refugee  Act,  the  Convention  Against  Torture  (\"CAT\"),  the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (\"APA  \"), and the Constitution.  Plaintiffs therefore seek to have it \nvacated and enjoined. \n2.  The United States has long been committed to providing refuge to those fleeing \nviolence and persecution, and Congress codified that commitment in the Refugee Act of 1980, \nwhich declares it to be ''the historic policy of the United States to respond to the urgent needs of \npersons subject to persecution in their homelands.\"  Refugee Act of 1980, § 101(a), Pub. L. No. \n96-212, 94 Stat. 102. \n3.  Even in amending the INA in 1996 to permit immigration officers to summarily \nexpel certain noncitizens from the United States on an expedited basis, Congress was careful to \nhonor our country's historic commitment to those seeking safe harbor by creating a screening \nprocess to ensure that anyone who might be eligible for asylum or related forms of humanitarian \nprotection would avoid expedited removal and have full access to the immigration and federal \ncourt systems to make their claims.  This \"credible fear\" assessment was deliberately designed to \n2 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 85   Filed 10/31/20   Page 4 of 28\nonly\n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 85   Filed 10/31/20   Page 5 of 28\nand sought asylum, but were denied the opportunity to apply for protection when asylum officers \nfound they lacked a \"credible fear\" under the Lesson Plan. \n9.  Plaintiffs seek a declaration that the Lesson Plan violates the INA, the Refugee Act, \nthe CAT, the APA  , and the Due Process Clause; an order enjoining this unlawful directive so that \nthey and others may have a fair opportunity to present their claims for humanitarian relief through \nthe system Congress created; and an order vacating their expedited removal orders and requiring \nthat they be provided, at a minimum, with new credible fear screenings under the proper legal \nstandard.  Those Plaintiffs who have not yet been removed-Ana and Emma-additionally seek a \nstay of their expedited removal. \nI 0.  Absent relief from this Court, Plaintiffs and thousands more who, like them, are \ndesperately seeking safety will be unlawfully deported and condemned to their countries of origin \nto face rape, beatings, and other forms of persecution and torture, including death. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n11.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C.  § 1252(e)(3), which \npermits review in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia of\"a written policy \ndirective, written policy guideline, or written procedure\" implementing the expedited removal \nstatute.  The Lesson Plan issued on April 30, 2019 is \"a written policy directive, written policy \nguideline, or written procedure\" implementing the expedited removal statute.  This Court also has \nsubject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331. \n12.  Venue is proper in this District because 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3) requires actions \nbrought thereunder to be filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.   See \nalso 5 U.S.C.  § 703.  Venue is also proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  § 1391(e)(l) because, on \n4 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 85   Filed 10/31/20   Page 6 of 28\npro bono   \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 85   Filed 10/31/20   Page 7 of 28\nSee\nsua sponte\n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 85   Filed 10/31/20   Page 8 of 28\n21.  In June 2019, an asylum officer determined-pursuant to a credible fear process \ngoverned by the unlawful standards and procedures contained in the Lesson Plan, and after an \ninterview that lasted under two hours, including interpretation-that Ana lacked a credible fear of \npersecution or torture.  An immigration judge subsequently agreed.  Ana is now at imminent risk \nof removal to El Salvador. \n22.  Plaintiff E=a* is  a  citizen  of El  Salvador  detained  in the  custody  of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security at the Karnes County Residential Center in Karnes City, Texas. \nIn El Salvador, she was threatened and emotionally and physically abused by the father of her \ndaughter.  He attempted to control her and treated her as if she were his property.  She was also \nbeaten and sexually abused by her brother.  E=a did not report any of this abuse to the police \nbecause she knew from experience and reputation that the police would not help.  She was \nespecially reluctant to report her daughter's father because he has close associations with the \npolice. On at least one occasion, one of those police officer associates threatened to detain her and \nto take away her daughter because she supposedly spoke to him in too aggressive a manner. E=a \nfled El Salvador fearing for her life and came to the United States seeking protection in May 2019. \n23.  In June 2019, an asylum officer determined-pursuant to a credible fear process \ngoverned by the unlawful standards and procedures contained in the Lesson Plan, and after an \ninterview that lasted under two hours, including interpretation--that E=a lacked a credible fear \nof persecution or torture.  She is awaiting her hearing with an i=igrationjudge, who will review \nthe negative decision issued by the asylum officer.  She is at risk of soon being removed to El \nSalvador. \n24.  Plaintiff Sofia* is a citizen of Cuba.  Sofia is married to U.S. lawful permanent \nresident.  A medical doctor who opposes Cuba's ruling party, she has made her views known \n7 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 85   Filed 10/31/20   Page 9 of 28\nthrough her political positions and refusal to acquiesce in demands of govermnent officials.  In \nresponse,  the  government has  accused her of being anti-revolutionary and  subjected her to \nsurveillance, threats, and detention.  The fear and stress Sofia experienced as a result of the Cuban \ngovermnent' s actions led her to miscarry a pregnancy and ultimately to decide to flee to the United \nStates immediately, rather than risk waiting in Cuba until her husband's petition was processed. \nShe came to the United States seeking protection in April2019. \n25.  In May 2019, an asylum officer determined-pursuant to a credible fear process \ngoverned by the unlawful standards and procedures contained in the Lesson Plan, and after an \ninterview that lasted under ninety minutes, including interpretation-that Sofia lacked a credible \nfear  of persecution  or torture.  An immigration judge subsequently  agreed.  Sofia sought \nreconsideration from the asylum officer, but that, too, was denied.  Shortly thereafter, she was \ndeported to Cuba, where she has been questioned by the authorities about why she fled.  She lives \nin constant fear of further governmental threats and harassment. \n26.  Plaintiff Julia* is a citizen of El Salvador.  She fled El Salvador after witnessing \nthe murder of a neighbor committed by gang members.  On multiple occasions following the \nmurder, the gang threatened to kill her if she reported their crime to the police.  Julia came to the \nUnited States seeking protection in April2019. \n27.  In May 2019, an asylum officer determined-pursuant to a credible fear process \ngoverned by the unlawful standards and procedures contained in the Lesson Plan, and after an \ninterview that lasted under two hours, including interpretation-that Julia lacked a credible fear of \npersecution or torture.  An immigration judge subsequently agreed.  Julia was removed to El \nSalvador shortly thereafter. \n8 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 85   Filed 10/31/20   Page 10 of 28\n28.  Defendant  Kevin K.  McAleenan is  sued  in his  official  capacities  as  Acting \nSecretary of Homeland Security and Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection.  In his \ncapacity as Acting  Secretary, Defendant McAleenan is  charged with the administration and \nenforcement of the immigration laws and leads the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") \nand its component agencies.  These components include USCIS, which employs asylum officers, \nand Customs and Border Protection (\"CBP\").  In his capacity as CBP Commissioner, he oversees \nthe work of CBP officers, including Border Patrol agents, who, on information and belief, are or \nsoon will be conducting credible fear screenings. \n29.  Defendant William P. Barr is sued in his official capacity as Attorney General of \nthe United States.  In this capacity, Defendant Barr is  charged with the  administration and \nenforcement of the immigration laws and leads the Department of Justice, which oversees the \nimmigration  courts.  The  immigration  courts  have  jurisdiction  to  review  credible  fear \ndeterminations by asylum officers. \n30.  Defendant Kenneth T.

Defendant Jennifer Higgins is sued in her official capacity as Associate Director of \nthe Refugee, Asylum and International Operations (\"RAIO\") Directorate for USCIS.  RAIO is \nresponsible for supervising and training asylum officers, including through policy documents such \nas the Lesson Plan. \n9 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 85   Filed 10/31/20   Page 11 of 28\nall \nSee \nsee\nsee\nnon-refoulement\n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 85   Filed 10/31/20   Page 12 of 28\nsee alsoid.\nsee also id. \nId.\nId.\n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 85   Filed 10/31/20   Page 13 of 28\nSee\nSee\nSee\n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 85   Filed 10/31/20   Page 14 of 28\npossibility\ncould establish\nsee also\nmight\n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 85   Filed 10/31/20   Page 15 of 28\n50.  There is no statutory or regulatory requirement that asylum seekers produce any \nevidence beyond their own testimony at the credible fear stage. \n51.  Nor is the credible fear stage suited to  complex factfmding.  Asylum seekers \ntypically are recent arrivals with little to no knowledge of U.S. immigration law, scant opportunity \nto marshal relevant evidence and even to identifY pertinent information, and limited access, if any, \nto counsel.  Many are  struggling with the trauma associated with persecution in their home \ncountries and their flight to the United States, as well as trauma and stress associated with their \ndetention by U.S. immigration officials.  The screening, furthermore, is required by law to be \nnonadversarial.  The asylum officer who makes the determination as to credible fear need not be \nan attorney. \n52.  As a formal matter, the credible fear screening is not considered to be part of the \napplication for asylum, which can be filed as late as a year after the asylum seeker's arrival (or \neven later in certain circumstances). \n53.  Negative credible fear determinations nonetheless remain a part of the procedural \nhistories of the cases in which they are issued. \n54.  Even if later vacated, a negative credible fear determination by an asylum officer \ncan make it more difficult for the asylum seeker to ultimately be found eligible for or be granted \nrelief from removal. \n55.  Even after an asylum seeker has been served a notice to appear and placed in formal \nremoval proceedings under 8 U.S.C. § 1229a, the government can return the asylum seeker to the \nexpedited removal process. \n14 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 85   Filed 10/31/20   Page 16 of 28\nen masse S.A. v. Trump\nsee also S.A. v. Trump\n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 85   Filed 10/31/20   Page 17 of 28\nMs. L v. U.S. Immigration & \nEast Bay Sanctuary Covenant v.

Similarly, in a visit to the United States' southern border in April2019, President \nTrump personally directed Border Patrol agents to tum asylum seekers away and to explain to any \njudge fmding fault with that action, \"Sorry, judge, I can't do it. We don't have the room.\" \n66.  By then, the Administration had already, in fact, adopted policies that have the \npurpose and effect of turning away asylum seekers, including through its ''metering\" program, \nunder which the only way many asylum seekers can exercise their statutory right to request asylum \nis to cross the border illegally, between ports of entry, and to surrender themselves to the ftrst \nBorder Patrol agent they can ftnd. \n67.  In recent months,  a number of asylum seekers, including children, have died \nattempting to apply for asylum by crossing between ports of entry, as the conditions are frequently \ntreacherous.  Several asylum seekers have died attempting to cross rivers. Others have died trying \nto cross the desert. \n68.  Members of the Administration have shown little remorse when confronted with \nthe awful consequences of their policies. The President has attempted to shift blame to the victims, \nrepeatedly denigrating asylum seekers without any factual basis, suggesting that they are lying, \n\"invading\" fraudsters who are ''not afraid of anything,\" and dehumanizing them to the point of \ncomparing them to animals.  In May 2018, President Trump said of people crossing the Mexican \nborder into the United States: \"You wouldn't believe how bad these people are. These aren't \npeople. These are animals.\" \n69.  The President has repeatedly opined that the entire asylum system is fraudulent, \nignoring that it is a system created by Congress in compliance with the United States' international \nobligations.  In April2019, President Trump repeatedly called the asylum system ''a big, fat con \njob.\" Furthermore, just before ftling ofthis suit, President Trump threatened massive immigration \n17 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 85   Filed 10/31/20   Page 19 of 28\nraids across the country targeting women and children if Democrats did not work together with \nRepublicans to fmd a solution to the \"loophole\" of migrants fleeing persecution having the right \nto ask for asylum in this country. \n70.  The Executive agencies under the President have also participated in disseminating \nfalse information about the asylum system. This spring, the Executive Office for Immigration \nReview issued a \"fact\" sheet that, among other things, dismissed as a \"myth\" the notion that \n\"[m]ost aliens who claim a credible fear of persecution have meritorious asylum claims.\"  In \nresponse to the \"fact\" sheet, the National Association oflmmigration Judges issued a press release \ndeclaring the document to be \"filled with errors and misinformation.\" \n71.  Similarly, a group of retired immigration judges and retired members of the Board \nof Immigration Appeals  wrote  an  open  letter to  the  Director  of the  Executive  Office  for \nImmigration Review that condemned the \"fact\" sheet as ''political pandering, at the expense of \npublic faith in the immigration courts,\" for presenting \"imagined 'myths' and wildly inaccurate \nand misleading information labeled as 'fact.\"'  True \"American courts,\" they cautioned, \"do not \nissue propaganda implying that those whose cases [they] rule[] on for the most part have invalid \nclaims[,] ... or that those unable to surmount the govermnent-created obstacles to filing asylum \napplications are somehow guilty of deceit.\"  \"Such statements,\" they continued, \"indicate a bias \nwhich is absolutely unacceptable and, frankly, shocking.\" \n72.  With recent changes in Administration staff, Defendants have renewed their focus \non credible fear screenings, making it a priority to drive down the rate at which asylum seekers \npass the screenings and avoid summary deportation. \n18 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 85   Filed 10/31/20   Page 20 of 28\n73.  Indeed, Defendant McAleenan and Defendant Cuccinelli were recently tapped to \nlead DHS and USCIS, respectively, for their willingness to take more aggressive stances than their \npredecessors to restrict applications for humanitarian relief. \n74.  Shortly after assuming his role, Defendant Cuccinelli admonished USCIS staff to \ndo \" [their] part to help stem the crisis and better secure the homeland\" when conducting credible \nfear screenings.  His message was considered by many who received it to be a thinly veiled threat \nthat asylum officers would be blamed for the Administration's failings if the credible fear passage \nrate did not materially drop. \n7 5.  In a further effort to lower the credible fear passage rate, Defendants have also \nbegun recruiting CBP officers, who are expected to be more \"aggressive\" with asylum seekers at \nthe border, to conduct credible fear screenings. \n76.  On April9, 2019, a senior Administration official reported that the Administration \nwould be implementing policy changes to make it more difficult for those asserting a fear of \npersecution or torture to access the U.S. immigration and federal  court systems.  Regarding \ncredible fear screenings, the official said that asylum officers would \"apply greater rigor and \nscrutiny to ... [asylum] claims,\" and suggested that DHS might mobilize assistance from the \nDepartment of State in order to further drive down the credible fear passage rate. \nThe Lesson Plan \n77.  On April 30, 2019, the USCIS RAIO Directorate issued a final written \"Lesson \nPlan\" on \"Credible Fear of Persecution and Torture Determinations.\"  Shortly thereafter, Reuters \npublished the Lesson Plan, a true and accurate copy of which is attached as Exhibit A. \n78.  The Lesson Plan is a policy document that controls the conduct of asylum officers \nin the credible fear process. \n19 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 85   Filed 10/31/20   Page 21 of 28\ncould\nhas \nwell-founded fear \npossibility\n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 85   Filed 10/31/20   Page 22 of 28\nGrace v.

On September 24, 2019, the USCIS RAIO Directorate issued a revised version of \nthe Credible Fear Lesson Plan (hereinafter, the \"September 2019 Lesson Plan\"). \n88b.  The September 2019 Lesson Plan contains the same unlawful features as does the \nApril2019 Lesson Plan, including those described in the foregoing allegations. \n88c.  For the paragraphs that follow, each and every reference to \"the Lesson Plan\" shall \nrefer to both the April2019 Lesson Plan and the September 2019 Lesson Plan \n88d.  For the paragraphs in the Prayer for Relief, each and every reference to \"on or \naround April30, 2019\" shall mean \"on or around April30, 2019 and/or on or around September \n24, 2019.\" \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Refugee Act, Immigration and Nationality Act, Convention Against Torture, & \nAdministrative Procedure Act) \n89.  All the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully set forth \nherein. \n90.  Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3), this Court's review is available to determine \nwhether the Lesson Plan is \"consistent with applicable provisions of [Subchapter II of the INA] or \nis otherwise in violation oflaw.\" \n91.  The APA provides that a Court \"shall hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \nfindings,  and conclusions found to be----{A)  arbitrary,  capricious, an abuse of discretion,  or \notherwise not in accordance with law; (B) contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or \nimmunity; [or] (C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory \nu.s.c. \nright.\"  5  § 706(2). \n23 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 85   Filed 10/31/20   Page 25 of 28\nsee see\nnon-refoulement \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 85   Filed 10/31/20   Page 26 of 28\nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Administrative Procedure Act) \n99.  All the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully set forth \nherein. \n100.  The APA   requires agency action that is substantive (or \"legislative\") in nature to \nfollow notice-and-comment procedures.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \n101.  The Lesson Plan reflects one or more substantive rules, including because it has the \nforce and effect of law and because it conflicts with various regulatory provisions, effectively \namending them. \n102.  Defendants did not follow notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures related to \nthe Lesson Plan. \n103.  The Lesson Plan therefore must be held unlawful and set aside for Defendants' \nfailure to observe the procedure required by the APA  .  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \nTlllRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Due Process Clause ofthe Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution) \n104.  All the foregoing allegations are repeated and incorporated as though fully set forth \nherein. \n105.  Plaintiffs have a protected interest in applying for asylum, withholding of removal, \nrelief under the CAT, and in not being removed to countries where they face serious danger, \npersecution, and potential loss of life. \n106.  Plaintiffs are entitled under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to a \nfair hearing of their claims, and a meaningful opportunity to establish their potential eligibility for \nasylum and other forms of relief from removal. \n107.  The credible fear policies contained in the Lesson Plan violated Plaintiffs' right to \ndue process in numerous ways, including by subjecting their claims to unlawful, more burdensome \n25 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 85   Filed 10/31/20   Page 27 of 28\nlegal standards, and by depriving them of a meaningful opportunity to establish their eligibility for \nasylum and other forms of humanitarian relief. \n108.  The Lesson Plan must therefore be enjoined as violative of the Fifth Amendment's \nguarantee of due process. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court: \n1.  \"[A]dvance on the docket and ... expedite to the greatest possible extent the \ndisposition\" of this case, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(D); \n2.  Enter an order staying the expedited removal of Plaintiffs Ana* and Emma* while \nthis case is pending; \n3.  Enter an order vacating the expedited removal orders issued to Plaintiffs; \n4.

This is a case about upholding the American commitment to treat fairly the asylum \nclaims of people, including children, who arrive at our borders fleeing persecution and violence.  \nOn  April  30,  2019,  in  yet  another  attempt  to  circumvent  this  commitment,  the  Trump \nAdministration issued a policy document (the “Lesson Plan”) to asylum officers who participate \nin the “credible fear” screening process—a process that Congress mandated in order to ensure that \nthe United States is not summarily removing people who might have bona fide asylum claims to \ncountries where they face persecution or torture.  This Lesson Plan violates the letter and the spirit \nof the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), the Refugee Act, the Convention Against Torture \n(“CAT”), the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), and the Constitution. \n2.  The United States has long been committed to providing refuge to those fleeing \nviolence and persecution, and Congress codified that commitment in the Refugee Act of 1980, \nwhich declares it to be “the historic policy of the United States to respond to the urgent needs of \npersons subject to persecution in their homelands.”  Refugee Act of 1980, § 101(a), Pub. L. No. \n96-212, 94 Stat. 102. \n3.  Even in amending the INA in 1996 to permit immigration officers to summarily \nexpel certain noncitizens from the United States on an expedited basis, Congress was careful to \nhonor our country’s historic commitment to those seeking safe harbor by creating a screening \nprocess to ensure that anyone who might be eligible for asylum or related forms of humanitarian \nprotection would avoid expedited removal and have full access to the immigration and federal \ncourt systems to make their claims.  This “credible fear” assessment was deliberately designed to \nbe a permissive standard to safeguard against the United States returning displaced people to \n2 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 3 of 21\ndangerous conditions they fled, because doing so contravenes international and domestic law \nobligations. \n4.  Since  taking  office,  however,  President  Trump  and  his  Administration  have \npursued an explicitly nativist agenda of closing the borders to asylum seekers without regard to \nour national commitments, including those enshrined in law.  \n5.  Most relevant to this case, the Administration has expressly adopted the goal of \ndramatically reducing the rate at which asylum seekers pass the initial, threshold “credible fear” \nscreening step—the only avenue through which they can apply for humanitarian protection—so as \nto facilitate their expeditious return to the violence and persecution they fled. \n6.  In furtherance of the Administration’s goal of turning away more asylum seekers, \non April 30, 2019, Defendants issued a new policy document in the form of a “Lesson Plan” to the \nhundreds of asylum officers who conduct these screenings.  The Lesson Plan instructs the officers \nin a manner that is contrary to the governing statutes and regulations and substantially—and \nunlawfully—narrows access to the immigration and federal court systems.   \n7.  Among  other  things,  the  Lesson  Plan  improperly  raises  the  asylum  seeker’s \nevidentiary burden; shifts to asylum seekers burdens actually borne by the government; and \nconverts what is supposed to be a nonadversarial, threshold screening into a biased and adversarial \nhearing through which asylum officers are to apply erroneous legal standards to decide ultimate \nissues that are supposed to await adjudication by the immigration courts.  \n8.  Plaintiff Maria M. Kiakombua is one of the asylum seekers at imminent risk of \ndeportation because of the Lesson Plan issued on April 30, 2019.  She fled her home in Angola to \nescape her boyfriend, a member of the country’s military, who beat her—sometimes with a \nmachete—and threatened to kill her if she left him.  Because of his government connections, she \n3 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 4 of 21\nalso suffered repeated attacks, including rape, at the hands of government officials.  She reached \nthe U.S. border and sought asylum, but an asylum officer found that she lacked a credible fear \nunder the Lesson Plan.  She seeks a declaration that the Lesson Plan violates the INA, the Refugee \nAct, the CAT, the APA, and the Due Process Clause; an order enjoining this unlawful directive so \nthat she and others may have a fair opportunity to present their claims for humanitarian relief \nthrough the system Congress created; and an order that her expedited removal order be vacated \nand that she be provided, at a minimum, with a new credible fear process under the proper legal \nstandard. \n9.  Absent injunctive relief from this Court, Ms. Kiakombua and thousands more who, \nlike her, are desperately seeking safety will be unlawfully deported to their countries of origin to \nface rape, beatings, death, and other forms of persecution. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n10.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3), \nwhich permits review in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia of “a written \npolicy directive, written policy guideline, or written procedure” implementing the expedited \nremoval statute.  This Court also has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331. \n11.  Venue is proper in this District because 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3) requires \nactions brought thereunder to be filed in the United States District Court for the District of \nColumbia.  Venue is also proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1) because, on information and \nbelief, a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the Complaint occurred within \nthe District of Columbia. \n4 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 5 of 21\nTHE PARTIES \n12.  Plaintiff Maria M. Kiakombua is a citizen of Angola detained in the custody of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security at the T. Don Hutto Residential Center in Taylor, Texas.  She \nwas forced to flee Angola because of harm she faced and feared would continue at the hands of \nher boyfriend, who is in the military, and other government officials.  Over the course of two years, \nMs. Kiakombua’s boyfriend beat her, sometimes with a machete, and threatened to kill her if she \nleft him.  Ms. Kiakombua was hospitalized at least once because of the injuries she suffered.  In \naddition, on more than one occasion, government officials associated with Ms. Kiakombua’s \nboyfriend came to her home and raped her in the presence of her children, due in part to her failure \nto abide by societal norms regarding the proper role and behavior of women.  They also beat her \nchildren and broke her son’s arm.  After fleeing Angola, Ms. Kiakombua came to the United States \nseeking protection in April 2019.  \n13.  In May 2019, an asylum officer determined—pursuant to a credible fear process \ngoverned by the unlawful standards and procedures contained in the Lesson Plan—that Ms. \nKiakombua lacked a credible fear of persecution or torture.  An immigration judge subsequently \nagreed.  Ms. Kiakombua sought reconsideration from the asylum officer, but that, too, was denied.  \nMs. Kiakombua is at imminent risk of removal to her home country. \n14.  Defendant  Kevin  K.  McAleenan  is  sued  in  his  official  capacities  as  Acting \nSecretary of Homeland Security and Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection.  In his \ncapacity as Acting Secretary, Defendant McAleenan is charged with the administration and \nenforcement of the immigration laws and leads the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) \nand  its  component  agencies.    These  components  include  United  States  Citizenship  and \nImmigration Services (“USCIS”), which employs asylum officers, and Customs and Border \n5 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 6 of 21\nProtection (“CBP”).  In his capacity as CBP Commissioner, he oversees the work of CBP officers, \nincluding Border Patrol agents, who, on information and belief, are or soon will be conducting \ncredible fear screenings. \n15.  Defendant William P. Barr is sued in his official capacity as Attorney General of \nthe United States.  In this capacity, Defendant Barr is charged with the administration and \nenforcement of the immigration laws and leads the Department of Justice, which oversees the \nimmigration  courts.  The  immigration  courts  have  jurisdiction  to  review  credible  fear \ndeterminations by asylum officers. \n16.  Defendant Kenneth T. Cuccinelli is sued in his official capacity as Acting Director \nof USCIS.  In this capacity, he oversees the work and training of asylum officers who conduct \ncredible fear screenings. \n17.  Defendant Jennifer Higgins is sued in her official capacity as Associate Director of \nRefugee, Asylum and International Operations (“RAIO”) for USCIS.  RAIO is responsible for \nsupervising and training asylum officers, including through policy documents such as the Lesson \nPlan. \nBACKGROUND \nRights of Asylum Seekers and Limits on the Executive’s Removal Authority \n18.  Congress has enshrined in U.S. law special protections for individuals fleeing \npersecution or torture, consistent with the humanitarian commitments of the United States under \ntreaties including the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees and the Convention Against \nTorture. \n6 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 7 of 21\n19.  In enacting the Refugee Act in 1980, Congress “declare[d]” that the Act’s purpose \nwas to codify “the historic policy of the United States to respond to the urgent needs of persons \nsubject to persecution in their homelands.”  § 101(a), 94 Stat. 102. \n20.  Consistent with that historic commitment, all noncitizens at or within U.S. borders \ngenerally have a right to apply for asylum—a form of protection available to individuals who can \nprove that they are “refugee[s]” within the meaning of the INA for having suffered persecution in \nthe past or having a “well-founded fear” of persecution in the future. \n21.  Other provisions of U.S. law prohibit the government from removing noncitizens \nto countries where they face persecution or torture, even if they are not granted asylum.  See 8 \nU.S.C. § 1231(b)(3); Convention Against Torture, Art. 3; 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(c), (d).  Rather, when \nappropriate, the government must grant the noncitizens protection in the form of withholding of \nremoval under the INA, see 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), or withholding or deferral of removal under \nthe CAT, see 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(c)(4). \nExpedited Removal and the Credible Fear Screening Safeguard \n22.  Before 1997, any noncitizen that the federal government wished to remove from \nthe United States generally was entitled to a full hearing before an immigration judge, with \nopportunities to challenge the alleged grounds for her removal and to apply for relief from removal, \nincluding asylum. \n23.  With the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, \nwhich went into effect in 1997, Congress created an expedited removal system through which \nimmigration officers outside the judicial system may order removed certain noncitizens without \nproviding them an opportunity to apply for relief from removal, and “without further hearing or \nreview.”  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i); see also id. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(I). \n7 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 8 of 21\n24.  Reflecting our country’s commitment to asylum seekers, however, and to avoid the \npossibility of unlawfully and inhumanely sending individuals back to persecution, Congress took \ncare to ensure that any noncitizen who “indicate[d] either an intention to apply for asylum under \n[8 U.S.C. § 1158] or a fear of persecution” would be accorded more process before they could be \nremoved—including, potentially, a full hearing before an immigration judge and subsequent \nreview  by  the  Board  of  Immigration  Appeals  and  federal  appellate  courts.  8  U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(A)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(f).   \n25.  Thus, if noncitizens in the expedited removal system indicate that they intend to \napply  for  asylum  or  fears  persecution,  immigration  officers  are  required  to  refer  them  for \ninterviews before asylum officers to determine if they have a “credible fear of persecution.”  8 \nU.S.C.  § 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii);  see  also  id.  § 1225(b)(1)(A)(ii).    Throughout  the  credible  fear \nscreening  process,  the  asylum  seekers  are  subject  to  mandatory  detention.    Id. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(IV). \n26.  If an asylum officer determines that an asylum seeker has a “credible fear of \npersecution,” the officer must refer the case to immigration court for a full hearing on whether the \nindividual is subject to removal in the first place and, if so, whether the asylum seeker is eligible \nfor protection such as asylum.  If, after the hearing and any appeals, the asylum seeker is found to \nbe removable and ineligible for protection, he or she is removed.  See 8 U.S.C. §1225(b)(1)(B)(ii); \n8 U.S.C. § 1229a; 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(f). \n27.  Since the adoption in 1999 of regulations implementing the Convention Against \nTorture—which bars the government from removing noncitizens to countries where they will be \ntortured—the credible fear safeguard has applied also to those who indicate a fear of torture and \nare deemed to have a “credible fear of torture.”  8 C.F.R. § 208.30(e), (f). \n8 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 9 of 21\n28.  When asylum officers determine that asylum seekers do not have a credible fear of \npersecution or torture, they are ordered removed “without further hearing or review.”  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(I).   \n29.  At this stage, asylum seekers may request review by an immigration judge, but the \njudge’s review is limited to assessing the credible fear determination.  If the immigration judge \naffirms—which is typically done through a checkbox form, with no explanation—the individuals \nare removed.  With few exceptions, there is no statutory or regulatory right to further review of \nthis  crucial  gatekeeping  function.    See  8  U.S.C.  § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii);  8  C.F.R. \n§ 1208.30(g)(2)(iv)(A), (B). \nConduct of Credible Fear Screenings \n30.  Congress designed the credible fear standard to enable asylum officers to quickly \nscreen out frivolous asylum claims while permitting those that are potentially meritorious to be \nadjudicated by immigration judges. \n31.  In doing so, Congress created what the Department of Justice has recognized as a \n“low threshold of proof of potential entitlement to asylum,” 62 Fed. Reg. 10,312, 10,320 (Mar. 6, \n1997).  As provided in the governing statute, “the term ‘credible fear of persecution’ means that \nthere is a significant possibility, taking into account the credibility of the statements made by the \nalien in support of the alien’s claim and such other facts as are known to the officer, that the alien \ncould establish eligibility for asylum under [8 U.S.C. § 1158].”  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v) \n(emphases added); see also 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(e) (same). \n32.  Reflecting its purpose and the circumstances of those who have just arrived at our \nborders fleeing violence and other forms of persecution, the interview must be conducted “in a \nnonadversarial  manner,”  with  the  asylum  officer  required  “to  elicit  all  relevant  and  useful \n9 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 10 of 21\ninformation bearing on whether the applicant has a credible fear of persecution or torture.”  8 \nC.F.R. § 208.30(d).   \n33.  Asylum  officers  must  receive  special  training  in  “international  human  rights \nlaw, nonadversarial interview techniques, and other relevant national and international refugee \nlaws and principles.”  8 C.F.R. § 208.1(b). \n34.  At the credible fear stage, the asylum officer’s mandate is not to adjudicate the \nclaim  (or  any  part  thereof)  on  the  merits,  but  rather  to  determine—on  information  that  is \ncircumscribed both by statute and by practical considerations—whether the asylum seeker might \nestablish eligibility for asylum if given that opportunity through formal removal proceedings.  \n35.  There is no statutory or regulatory requirement that asylum seekers produce any \nevidence beyond their own testimony at the credible fear stage.  \n36.  Nor is the credible fear stage suited to complex factfinding.  Asylum seekers \ntypically are recent arrivals with little to no knowledge of U.S. immigration law, scant opportunity \nto marshal relevant evidence and even to identify pertinent information, and limited access, if any, \nto counsel. Many are struggling with the trauma associated with persecution in their home \ncountries and their flight to the United States, as well as trauma and stress associated with their \ndetention by U.S. immigration officials.  The screening, furthermore, is required by law to be \nnonadversarial.  The asylum officer who makes the determination as to credible fear need not be \nan attorney.   \n37.  As a formal matter, the credible fear screening is not considered to be part of the \napplication for asylum, which can be filed as late as a year after the asylum seeker’s arrival (or \neven later in certain circumstances). \nDefendants’ Policy to Drive Down the Credible Fear Passage Rate \n10 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 11 of 21\n38.  As a candidate, President Trump ran an explicitly nativist campaign that demonized \nimmigrants and refugees, particularly those who are not (or are not perceived as) white.   \n39.  Since taking office, President Trump has acted on his nativist promises, making \nunprecedented policy changes to advance his agenda without any regard for the law or the \ndevastating impact that they would have on the lives of those who come to the United States \nseeking refuge.  \n40.  For example, the Trump Administration implemented a widely criticized policy of \nforcibly separating migrant parents from their children.  Administration officials have admitted \nthat the goal of the separation was to discourage Central American families from traveling to the \nborder and applying for asylum.  The separation policy was challenged as unlawful, and a federal \njudge granted a classwide preliminary injunction.  See Ms. L v. U.S. Immigration & Customs Enf’t, \n310 F. Supp. 3d 1133 (S.D. Cal. 2018).  The Trump Administration estimates it could take it two \nmore years just to identify thousands of migrant families that it forcibly separated, and even longer \nto reunify them. \n41.  Likewise, in November 2018, the Trump Administration sought to render ineligible \nfor asylum noncitizens who entered the United States outside of a port of entry, in defiance of \nstatutory language explicitly making such individuals eligible.  That policy, too, was preliminarily \nenjoined.  See East Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, 354 F. Supp. 3d 1094 (N.D. Cal. 2018). \n42.  Most relevant to this case, the Trump Administration has also sought to make it \nmore difficult for those from Central America in particular to pass credible fear screenings and to \napply for asylum. These changes were enjoined by a court in this district in Grace v. Whitaker, \n344 F. Supp. 3d 96 (D.D.C. 2018), appeal docketed, No. 19-5013 (D.C. Cir.). \n11 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 12 of 21\n43.  As well as through these policies that have already been enjoined by courts, \nPresident Trump has made clear through his words—including materially false and misleading \nstatements about the immigration system—his intent to destroy the asylum system and the credible \nfear process that Congress mandated.   \n44.  In fact, the President has personally directed blatantly illegal actions targeting \nasylum seekers.  \n45.  In March 2019, President Trump ordered then-Secretary of Homeland Security \nKirstjen Nielsen to close the El Paso port of entry and at the very least to deny entry to asylum \nseekers; Secretary Nielsen refused, and was shortly thereafter forced to resign.  \n46.  Similarly, in a visit to the United States’ southern border in April 2019, President \nTrump personally directed Border Patrol agents to turn asylum seekers away and to explain to any \njudge finding fault with that action, “Sorry, judge, I can’t do it. We don’t have the room.” \n47.  The President has also repeatedly denigrated asylum seekers without any factual \nbasis, dehumanizing them to the point of comparing them to animals.  President Trump often \nsuggests that people seeking asylum are liars who are “not afraid of anything.”  In May 2018, \nPresident Trump said of people crossing the Mexican border into the United States: “You wouldn’t \nbelieve how bad these people are. These aren’t people. These are animals.”  \n48.  The President has repeatedly opined that the entire asylum system is fraudulent, \nignoring that it is a system created by Congress in compliance with the United States’ international \nobligations.  In April 2019, President Trump repeatedly called the asylum system “a big, fat con \njob.”  Furthermore, just before filing of this suit, President Trump threatened massive immigration \nraids across the country targeting women and children if Democrats did not work together with \n12 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 13 of 21\nRepublicans to find a solution to the “loophole” of migrants fleeing persecution having the right \nto ask for asylum in this country. \n49.  The Executive agencies under the President have also participated in disseminating \nfalse information about the asylum system. This spring, the Executive Office for Immigration \nReview issued a “fact” sheet that, among other things, dismissed as a “myth” the notion that \n“[m]ost aliens who claim a credible fear of persecution have meritorious asylum claims.”  In \nresponse to the “fact” sheet, the National Association of Immigration Judges issued a press release \ndeclaring the document to be “filled with errors and misinformation.”   \n50.  Similarly, a group of retired immigration judges and retired members of the Board \nof  Immigration  Appeals  wrote  an  open  letter  to  the  Director  of  the  Executive  Office  for \nImmigration Review that condemned the “fact” sheet as “political pandering, at the expense of \npublic faith in the immigration courts,” for presenting “imagined ‘myths’ and wildly inaccurate \nand misleading information labeled as ‘fact.’”  True “American courts,” they cautioned, “do not \nissue propaganda implying that those whose cases [they] rule[] on for the most part have invalid \nclaims[,] . . . or that those unable to surmount the government-created obstacles to filing asylum \napplications are somehow guilty of deceit.”  “Such statements,” they continued, “indicate a bias \nwhich is absolutely unacceptable and, frankly, shocking.” \n51.  With recent changes in Administration staff, Defendants have renewed their focus \non credible fear screenings, making it a priority to drive down the rate at which asylum seekers \npass the screenings and avoid summary deportation.   \n52.  Indeed, Defendant McAleenan and Defendant Cuccinelli were recently tapped to \nlead DHS and USCIS, respectively, for their willingness to take more aggressive stances than their \npredecessors to restrict applications for humanitarian relief.   \n13 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 14 of 21\n53.  Shortly after assuming his role, Defendant Cuccinelli admonished USCIS staff to \ndo “[their] part to help stem the crisis and better secure the homeland” when conducting credible \nfear screenings.  His message was considered by many who received it to be a thinly veiled threat \nthat asylum officers would be blamed for the Administration’s failings if the credible fear passage \nrate did not materially drop.   \n54.  In a further effort to lower the credible fear passage rate, Defendants have also \nbegun recruiting CBP officers, who are expected to be more “aggressive” with asylum seekers at \nthe border, to conduct credible fear screenings. \n55.  On April 9, 2019, a senior Administration official reported that the Administration \nwould be implementing policy changes to make it more difficult for those asserting a fear of \npersecution or torture to access the U.S. immigration and federal court systems.  Regarding \ncredible fear screenings, the official said that asylum officers would “apply greater rigor and \nscrutiny to . . . [asylum] claims,” and suggested that DHS might mobilize assistance from the \nDepartment of State in order to further drive down the credible fear passage rate. \nThe Lesson Plan \n56.  On April 30, 2019, the USCIS RAIO Directorate issued a final written “Lesson \nPlan” on “Credible Fear of Persecution and Torture Determinations.” \n57.  The Lesson Plan is a policy document that controls the conduct of asylum officers \nin credible fear screenings.   \n58.  When promulgating regulations on the expedited removal process, the Department \nof Justice declined to elaborate on the standard, reasoning that asylum officer training—founded \non documents like the Lesson Plan—would be “extensive” in order to control how the credible \nfear standard was “applied to particular cases” and to “ensure that the standard [wa]s implemented \n14 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 15 of 21\nin a way which w[ould] encourage flexibility and a broad application of the statutory standard,” \nconsistent with Congress’ aim.  62 Fed. Reg. 10,312, 10,317 (Mar. 6, 1997). \n59.  Here, however, the Lesson Plan executes Defendants’ policy to drive down the \ncredible fear passage rate by directing asylum officers to conduct interviews in a manner that is \ncontrary  to  the  statutory  scheme,  binding  regulations,  judicial  precedent,  and  longstanding \npractice.  It does so in myriad ways. \n60.  For example, the Lesson Plan effectively converts the credible fear determination \nfrom an inquiry into whether an asylum seeker could establish eligibility for relief in the future \ninto an adjudication on whether the asylum seeker actually has established eligibility.   \n61.  Throughout the Lesson Plan, Defendants suggest that the asylum seeker’s ability to \nsucceed on a credible fear determination will hinge on her ability to fully establish eligibility for \nrelief in all of its intricacies.  Among other things, the Lesson Plan: \na.  requires the asylum seeker to identify specific facts sufficient to establish eligibility for \nasylum in order to be found credible, even if such facts are not and would not be \nexpected to be within the asylum seeker’s knowledge; \nb.  requires the asylum seeker to establish “a significant possibility of future persecution,” \nwhen the credible fear standard merely requires a significant possibility of establishing \neligibility, and even the substantive asylum standard requires only a “well-founded fear \nof persecution”; and \nc.  otherwise fails to describe the relevant asylum standards according to the controlling \nquestion of whether the asylum seeker has a significant possibility of meeting those \nstandards in the future. \n62.  The Lesson Plan also increases the evidentiary burden the asylum seeker must carry \nto pass a credible fear screening by, among other things, imposing an unlawful corroboration \nrequirement;  requiring  the  asylum  seeker  to  present  “more  than  ‘significant  evidence’”  of \neligibility, contrary to the applicable standard; unlawfully prohibiting asylum officers from making \nallowances  for  special  circumstances—such  as  trauma,  the  passage  of  time,  or  cultural \n15 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 16 of 21\nconsiderations—that may make it difficult for the asylum seeker to present her story in the setting \nof the credible fear screening; and placing the onus on the asylum seeker to produce testimony that \nis in fact the officer’s duty to elicit. \n63.  Relatedly, the Lesson Plan turns what the law requires to be a nonadversarial \ninterview into an adversarial process that is biased against the asylum seeker, with the asylum \nofficer functioning at once as opponent and arbiter.  Among other things, the Lesson Plan: \na.  requires—in contravention of binding regulations—asylum officers to measure the \nasylum seeker’s statements against information in Department of State-issued \nreports  that  the  current  Administration  recently  revised  to  remove  accurate \ninformation helpful to asylum seekers, and to treat the reports as “objective” fact; \nb.  instructs asylum officers—in contravention of law—that they need not provide the \nasylum seeker with an opportunity to address concerns that might lead to a negative \ncredibility determination; and \nc.  encourages asylum officers to find ways to use prior statements to Border Patrol to \nimpeach the asylum seeker. \n64.  In addition, Lesson Plan misrepresents the substantive law to be applied in the \ncredible fear process, and in ways that prejudice applicants.  For example, the Lesson Plan: \na.  doubles down on an erroneous construction of private actor persecution that was \nenjoined by  Grace v. Whitaker, 344 F. Supp. 3d 96, 107 (D.D.C. 2018), by \ninstructing that “the government [in the asylum seeker’s country of origin] must \nhave abdicated its responsibility to control persecution” for harm due to actions of \na private actor to constitute persecution; \nb.  shifts what is the government’s burden to the asylum seeker in resolving certain \nissues relating to past persecution and humanitarian asylum; and \nc.  mischaracterizes controlling Supreme Court and other case law so that asylum \nofficers will determine that no credible fear exists, when a faithful application of \nthe law would (or at the very least could) lead to the opposite result. \n65.  The Lesson Plan is problematic as well for what it omits from previous guidance, \nwithout explanation or even acknowledgment.  For example, the Lesson Plan omits the regulation-\nbased instruction that “novel or unique issues . . . merit consideration in a full hearing before an \n16 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 17 of 21\nimmigration  judge”  even  if  a  negative  credible  fear  determination  might  otherwise  seem \nwarranted, 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(e)(4); omits instruction in other applicable law and procedure that is \nhelpful  to  the  asylum  officer  and  favorable  to  the  asylum  seeker;  and  otherwise  modifies \nlongstanding  guidance  to  artificially  and  unlawfully  achieve  the  Administration’s  aim  of \ndecreasing the number of individuals who pass credible fear screenings. \n66.  In sum, the Lesson Plan is not a good-faith attempt to provide guidance to the \nhundreds of asylum officers tasked with the life-and-death responsibility of screening out frivolous \nprotection claims from the rest, but a biased, error-filled set of instructions designed to turn back \nas many asylum seekers as possible.  This is not the system Congress designed. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF  \n(Refugee Act, Immigration and Nationality Act, Convention Against Torture, & \nAdministrative Procedure Act) \n67.  All the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully set forth \nherein. \n68.  Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3), this Court’s review is available to determine \nwhether the Lesson Plan is “consistent with applicable provisions of [Subchapter II of the INA] or \nis otherwise in violation of law.” \n69.  The APA provides that a Court “shall hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \nfindings, and conclusions found to be—(A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \notherwise not in accordance with law; (B) contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or \nimmunity; [or] (C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory \nright.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \n70.  The Refugee Act provides that “[a]ny alien who is physically present in the United \nStates or who arrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated port of arrival …), \nirrespective of such alien’s status, may apply for asylum.”  8 U.S.C. § 1158(a). \n17 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 18 of 21\n71.  Defendants are prohibited from removing individuals to a country where they will \nbe persecuted, see INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3); or tortured, see Convention Against Torture, Art. \n3; 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(c), (d).   \n72.  The credible fear policies contained in the Lesson Plan violate the INA, the Refugee \nAct, and the CAT; are arbitrary and capricious; and are contrary to law.   \n73.  Among other reasons, the credible fear policies contained in the Lesson Plan \nconflict with the statutory credible fear standard and process; conflict with various regulatory \nprovisions governing the credible fear standard and process, including as it relates to the CAT; \nrepresent departures from longstanding agency policy without so much as an acknowledgment of \nthose  departures,  much  less  reasoned  explanations  therefor;  are  illogical,  irrational,  legally \nerroneous, and fail to adequately take into account all relevant factors; and deprive credible fear \napplicants of a meaningful opportunity to establish their eligibility for asylum and other forms of \nhumanitarian relief.   \n74.  The Lesson Plan must therefore be held unlawful, set aside, or otherwise vacated. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Administrative Procedure Act)  \n75.  All the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully set forth \nherein. \n76.  The APA requires agency action that is substantive (or “legislative”) in nature to \nfollow notice-and-comment procedures.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \n77.  The Lesson Plan reflects one or more substantive rules, including because it has the \nforce and effect of law and because it conflicts with various regulatory provisions, effectively \namending them. \n18 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 19 of 21\n78.  Defendants did not follow notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures related to \nthe Lesson Plan. \n79.  The Lesson Plan therefore must be held unlawful and set aside for Defendants’ \nfailure to observe the procedure required by the APA.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution) \n80.  All the foregoing allegations are repeated and incorporated as though fully set forth \nherein. \n81.  Ms. Kiakombua has a protected interest in applying for asylum, withholding of \nremoval, relief under the CAT, and in not being removed to a country where she faces serious \ndanger and potential loss of life. \n82.  Ms. Kiakombua is entitled under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment \nto a fair hearing of her claims, and a meaningful opportunity to establish her potential eligibility \nfor asylum and other forms of relief from removal. \n83.  The credible fear policies contained in the Lesson Plan violated Ms. Kiakombua’s \nright to due process in numerous ways, including by subjecting her claims to unlawful, more \nburdensome legal standards, and by depriving her of a meaningful opportunity to establish her \neligibility for asylum and other forms of humanitarian relief. \n84.  The Lesson Plan must therefore be enjoined as violative of the Fifth Amendment’s \nguarantee of due process. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Ms. Kiakombua respectfully requests that this Court: \n1.  “[A]dvance on the docket and . . . expedite to the greatest possible extent the \ndisposition” of this case, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(D); \n19 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 20 of 21\n2.  Enter an order staying Ms. Kiakombua’s expedited removal; \n3.  Enter an order vacating the expedited removal order issued to Ms. Kiakombua; \n4.  Declare the Lesson Plan and all related credible fear guidance issued by Defendants \non or around April 30, 2019 contrary to law;  \n5.

INTRODUCTION \nThe Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”)—and, in particular, DHS’s sub-\nagency, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”)—is tasked \nwith the responsibility of training federal employees to make sensitive and \nconsequential judgments concerning the asylum eligibility of noncitizens seeking refuge \nin the United States.1  Federal law specifically prescribes the substantive standards that \nfront-line asylum officers apply in order to identify those noncitizens designated for \nexpedited removal who have a “credible fear or persecution” in their home countries \nand are thus entitled to a more probing evaluation of their asylum request in the context \nof a full removal hearing.  See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 208.30; see \nalso Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (“IIRIRA”), \nPub. L. No. 104-208, div. C, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (amending 8 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq.).  \nUSCIS has also developed a related training course for its screening officers, which \nutilizes a manual titled the “Lesson Plan on Credible Fear of Persecution and Torture \nDeterminations.”  (Ex. 1 to Admin. Record (“Lesson Plan”), ECF No. 61-1, at 2–38.)2  \nThat document—which the agency colloquially refers to as “the Lesson Plan”—purports \n“to explain [to asylum officers] how to determine whether an alien subject to expedited \nremoval or an arriving stowaway has a credible fear of persecution or torture.”  (Id. at \n2.)  According to USCIS, the Lesson Plan enables asylum officers “to correctly make a \n \n1 This Memorandum Opinion employs the term “noncitizen” in lieu of the term “alien” to refer to “any \nperson who is not a citizen or national of the United States.”  Pereira v. Sessions, 138 S. Ct. 2105, 2110 \nn.1 (2018).  The latter is commonly used in immigration-related statutes and regulations.  See, e.g., 8 \nU.S.C. § 1101(a)(3). \n2 Page-number citations to the documents that the parties and the Court have filed refer to the page \nnumbers that the Court’s Electronic Case Filing (“ECF”) system automatically assigns. \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 5 of 99\ncredible fear determination consistent with the statutory provisions, regulations, \npolicies, and procedures that govern whether the applicant has established a credible \nfear of persecution or a credible fear of torture.”  (Id.)   \nThe instant action challenges that proposition.  Plaintiffs Maria Kiakombua, Ana, \nEmma, Sofia, and Julia (collectively “Plaintiffs”) are noncitizens subject to expedited \nremoval who allege that, sometime between May and June of 2019, USCIS screening \nofficers made adverse credible fear determinations with respect to each of them \npursuant to the Lesson Plan’s directives.  (See Suppl. First Am. Compl. (“Am. \nCompl.”), ECF No. 62-2, ¶¶ 8, 14, 21, 23, 25, 27.)  Plaintiffs assert, inter alia, that the \ncurrent version of the Lesson Plan is unlawfully designed “to drive down the rate at \nwhich asylum seekers pass the screenings and avoid summary deportation[,]” and that it \ndoes so by, among other things, directing asylum officers to make credible fear \ndeterminations in a manner that is manifestly inconsistent with the governing statutory \nand regulatory requirements.  (Id. ¶ 72; see, e.g., id. ¶ 85 (“[T]he Lesson Plan \nmisrepresents the substantive law to be considered by the asylum officer to evaluate \npotential eligibility for asylum or other humanitarian protection[.]”).)  For example, \naccording to Plaintiffs, the Lesson Plan “converts the credible fear determination from \nan inquiry into whether an asylum seeker could establish eligibility for relief in the \nfuture” (id. ¶ 81), as the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”) provides, see 8 \nU.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v), “into an adjudication on whether the asylum seeker actually \nhas established eligibility” during the initial screening phase (Am. Compl. ¶ 81).  \nSimilarly, Plaintiffs allege that the Lesson Plan “increases the evidentiary burden the \nasylum seeker must carry to pass a credible fear screening” insofar as it “impos[es] an \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 6 of 99\nunlawful corroboration requirement; requir[es] the asylum seeker to present more than \nsignificant evidence of eligibility . . . ; and plac[es] the onus on the asylum seeker to \nproduce testimony that is in fact the officer’s duty to elicit.”  (Id. ¶ 83 (internal \nquotation marks omitted).)   \nPlaintiffs’ three-count lawsuit, which has been filed against the Attorney \nGeneral, DHS, USCIS, the Refugee, Asylum, and International Operations (“RAIO”) \nDirectorate, and United States Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) (collectively, \n“Defendants”), claims that: (1) the current Lesson Plan is inconsistent with the \nprovisions of certain immigration-related statutes, other federal laws, and customary \ninternational law (see Am. Compl. ¶¶ 89–98 (“First Claim for Relief”)); (2) Defendants \nfailed to follow notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures when they crafted the \ncurrent Lesson Plan, in violation of the procedural requirements of the Administrative \nProcedure Act (“APA”) (id. ¶¶ 99–103 (“Second Claim for Relief”)); and (3) as it is \ncurrently constituted, the Lesson Plan transgresses the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution (see id. ¶¶ 104–08 (“Third Claim for \nRelief”)).   \nBefore this Court at present are the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment \nconcerning Plaintiffs’ legal claims.  (See Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. \n(“Defs.’ Mot.”), ECF No. 31-1; Pls.’ Mem. in Supp. of Cross-Mot. for Summ. J. and in \nOpp’n to Defs.’ Mot. (“Pls.’ Mot.”), ECF No. 36-1; Defs.’ Mem. of Law in Opp’n to \nPls.’ Mot. and Reply in Supp. of Defs.’ Mot. (“Defs.’ Reply”), ECF No. 49; Pls.’ Reply \nMem. of Law in Supp. of Pls.’ Mot. (“Pls.’ Reply”), ECF No. 60.)  In their motion, \nDefendants make a host of threshold arguments, including that Plaintiffs lack Article III \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 7 of 99\nstanding (see Defs.’ Mot. at 24), that Plaintiffs’ claims are moot (see Defs.’ Reply at \n13), and that the Court does not have subject-matter jurisdiction over the claims in \nPlaintiffs’ pleading (see Defs.’ Mot. at 30–31).  Defendants also contend that “the \nLesson Plan is not actionable under either the APA or the INA” (id. at 37) and that \nPlaintiffs’ claims fail on the merits in any event (id. at 47).  Defendants further \nmaintain that, even if the Court finds that Plaintiffs’ claims are meritorious, the only \navailable remedy is a declaration that the Lesson Plan is unlawful.  (Id. at 63.)  \nPlaintiffs’ filings counter each of Defendants’ threshold arguments (see, e.g., Pls.’ Mot. \nat 22–23, 32), and insist that there are “numerous independent grounds” for concluding \nthat the Lesson Plan is unlawful (id. at 39 (asserting that the Lesson Plan contradicts \nthe INA, was revised in an arbitrary and capricious manner, was not amended through \nnotice-and-comment rulemaking, and/or violates the Due Process Clause)).  Plaintiffs \nalso maintain that the INA does not curtail this Court’s authority to issue any \nappropriate equitable remedy.  (See id. at 63.)  \nFor the reasons explained fully below, the Court concludes that there is no \nthreshold impediment to its reaching the merits of Plaintiffs’ legal claims, and that \ncertain provisions of the Lesson Plan are manifestly inconsistent with the INA and its \nimplementing regulations as a matter of law.  Moreover, because the unlawful \nprovisions of the Lesson Plan cannot be severed from the remainder of the document, \nthis Court finds that the entire document must be vacated, which is a remedy that the \nCourt retains full equitable power to order under the circumstances presented in this \ncase.  In addition, to remedy the application of unlawful standards in the context of the \nscreening processes that USCIS undertook to evaluate Plaintiffs’ asylum eligibility, the \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 8 of 99\nCourt will require USCIS to provide new credible fear determinations for each Plaintiff.   \nThus, Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment will be GRANTED with respect \nto their first claim for relief, and Defendant’s cross-motion for summary judgment will \nbe DENIED.  Furthermore, the Lesson Plan will be VACATED in its entirety, and \nDefendants will be ENJOINED to void each Plaintiff’s existing credible fear \ndetermination and provide Plaintiffs with new credible fear interviews, as necessary for \nDefendants to make a lawful determination regarding whether each Plaintiff has a \ncredible fear of persecution that entitles her to a full removal hearing.  A separate Order \nconsistent with this Memorandum Opinion will follow. \nII.  BACKGROUND \nA.  Credible Fear Screenings And The U.S. Asylum Process \nFor almost a century, Congress has recognized that citizens of foreign states are \nsometimes forced to flee from persecution in their home countries, and it has been the \npolicy of the United States government that this country ought to serve as a place of \nrefuge for persons who are in such distress.  “[T]he language through which Congress \nhas implemented this policy since 1947 has changed slightly from time to time[,]” but \n“the basic policy has remained constant—to provide a haven for homeless refugees and \nto fulfill American responsibilities in connection with the International Refugee \nOrganization of the United Nations.”  Rosenberg v. Yee Chien Woo, 402 U.S. 49, 52 \n(1971).  The Refugee Act of 1980, Pub. L. No. 96-212, 94 Stat. 102 (codified at 8 \nU.S.C. §§ 1157–1159), specifically embraces the United States’ commitment to \nproviding safe harbor for refugees insofar as it acknowledges “the historic policy of the \nUnited States to respond to the urgent needs of persons subject to persecution in their \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 9 of 99\nhomelands,” and “encourage[s] all nations to provide assistance and resettlement \nopportunities to refugees to the fullest extent possible[,]” 8 U.S.C. § 1521 note; see also \nI.N.S. v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 436–37 (1987).   \nIn keeping with this well-settled policy, over the course of the last four decades, \nCongress has codified various procedures that govern how the United States will \nevaluate and process the admission requests of refugees.  Federal law provides that “any \nperson who is outside any country of such person’s nationality” and who is “unable or \nunwilling to return to . . . that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of \npersecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social \ngroup, or political opinion” qualifies as a “refugee[.]”  8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A).  \nStatutes authorize the Attorney General to grant “asylum” to any refugee, id. \n§ 1158(b)(1)(A), and further mandate that even when a noncitizen is subject to a rapid \nexpulsion process known as “expedited removal” (because they fit within an established \ncategory of persons who can be summarily removed without full hearings or other \nprocess), such noncitizen can only be so removed if she does not have “an intention to \napply for asylum under [8 U.S.C. § 1158] or a fear of persecution.”  Id. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(A)(i).3   \n \n3 Expedited removal is a statutorily authorized process that permits the government to reject the entry \ninto the United States of certain categories of noncitizens “without further hearing or review.”             \n8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i).  By statute, the Attorney General has “sole and unreviewable discretion” \nto “designate[]” for expedited removal “any or all” noncitizens who are deemed inadmissible (as \ndefined by sections 1182(a)(6)(C) and (a)(7) of the INA) and who have “not affirmatively shown” that \nthey have “been physically present in the United States continuously for the 2-year period immediately \nprior to the date of the determination of inadmissibility[.]”  Id. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I)–(II).  The \nAttorney General has conferred this designation authority to DHS, see Inspection and Expedited \nRemoval of Aliens, 62 Fed. Reg. 10,312, 10,355 (Mar. 6, 1997); 6 U.S.C. § 557 (2003), which, until \nrecently, opted to designate for expedited removal only those inadmissible noncitizens who were \nencountered near the border and had been in the country for no longer than 14 days, see Designating \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 10 of 99\nSignificantly for present purposes, federal immigration law plainly establishes \nthat, for those noncitizens who are designated for expedited removal—such as the five \nindividual plaintiffs in this case—applying for asylum is a two-stage process.  To start, \nif a noncitizen encounters a CPB agent or other immigration officer and “indicates \neither an intention to apply for asylum . . . or a fear of persecution” in their home \ncountry, the immigration officer is required to “refer the alien for an interview by a[] \n[USCIS] asylum officer,” who has the responsibility of determining whether or not the \nindividual has a credible “fear of persecution.”  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(ii).  This \ninitial evaluation is a “screening interview[,]” Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. \nThuraissigiam, 140 S. Ct. 1959, 1965 (2020), and it poses a “low bar” for asylum \napplicants, id. at 1967; see also Regulations Concerning the Convention Against \nTorture, 64 Fed. Reg. 8,478, 8,479 (Feb. 19, 1999) (noting that the credible fear \ndetermination merely permits a screening officer to “quickly identify potentially \nmeritorious claims to protection and to resolve frivolous ones with dispatch”).  Thus, \nfor the purpose of an asylum officer’s credible fear assessment, the noncitizen need not \ndemonstrate “that he or she is in fact eligible for asylum[.]”  Thuraissigiam, 140 S. Ct. \nat 1965 (emphasis in original).  Rather, according to the statute, “the term ‘credible fear \nof persecution’ means that there is a significant possibility, taking into account the \ncredibility of the statements made by the alien in support of the alien’s claim and such \n \nAliens for Expedited Removal, 69 Fed. Reg. 48,877, 48,880 (Aug. 11, 2004).  In July of 2019, DHS \nissued a notice that expands the categories of individuals who are subject to expedited removal, to \ninclude all inadmissible noncitizens located “anywhere in the United States” who have “not been \nphysically present in the United States continuously for the [preceding] two-year period[.]”  \nDesignating Aliens for Expedited Removal, 84 Fed. Reg. 35,409, 35,414 (July 23, 2019).  \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 11 of 99\nother facts as are known to the officer, that the alien could establish eligibility for \nasylum[.]”  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v).   \nThe applicable statute, i.e., section 1225(b) of Title 8 of the United States Code, \nalso plainly addresses the consequences of a positive or adverse credible fear finding \nduring this initial screening process.  If the asylum officer determines that the \nnoncitizen has a credible fear of persecution, the individual “shall be detained for \nfurther consideration of the application for asylum,” 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii), and, \nthus, shall proceed to the full proceeding stage of the asylum application process, see 8 \nC.F.R. § 208.30(f) (“If an alien . . . is found to have a credible fear of persecution or \ntorture, the asylum officer will . . . issue a Form I-862, Notice to Appear, for full \nconsideration of the asylum and withholding of removal claim in proceedings” under \nsection 1229a of Title 8 of the United States Code).  By contrast, if the asylum officer \ndetermines that the noncitizen does not have a credible fear of persecution, “the officer \nshall order the alien removed from the United States without further hearing or review.”  \n8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(I).  At that point, the noncitizen can ask an immigration \njudge to review the negative credible fear determination, see id. §§ 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii) \n(I)–(III), and if such a review is requested, the immigration judge reviews the matter de \nnovo, based on the “record of the [asylum officer’s] negative credible fear \ndetermination,” 8 C.F.R. § 1208.30(g)(2)(ii), supplemented with any additional “oral or \nwritten statement” that the immigration judge decides, in her sole discretion, to receive \ninto evidence, id. § 1003.42(c).  The immigration judge must also give the noncitizen \nthe opportunity to be heard and questioned, either in person or via remote connection.  \nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(III).  However, with or without additional evidence, \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 12 of 99\nthe immigration judge’s review is a “highly expedited” affair that “is meant to conclude \nwithin 24 hours.”  Make the Rd. New York v. Wolf (“MTRNY II”), 962 F.3d 612, 619 \n(D.C. Cir. 2020).   \nUltimately, if the immigration judge concludes that the noncitizen has a credible \nfear of persecution, the asylum officer’s negative credible fear determination will be \nvacated, and the agency will place the individual into full removal proceedings, see 8 \nC.F.R. §§ 208.30(e)(5), 1003.42(f), 1208.30(g)(2)(iv)(B); see also 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii), by serving on the noncitizen and filing with the immigration court a \nNotice to Appear, see 8 C.F.R. § 235.6(a)(1)(iii); id. § 1239.1(a).4  But if the \nimmigration judge concurs with the asylum officer’s decision that the noncitizen does \nnot have a credible fear of persecution, then the individual will be “removed from the \nUnited States without further hearing or review.”  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(I); see \nalso 8 C.F.R. § 1208.30(g)(2)(iv)(A).  Moreover, and importantly, the noncitizen’s bid \nfor asylum ends there, because the INA expressly prohibits further review of the \nnegative credible fear determination, whether by the Board of Immigration Appeals \n(“BIA”) or in federal court.  See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1225(b)(1)(C), 1252(a)(2)(A)(iii), (e)(2); \nsee also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.42(f).   \n \n4 This Court takes judicial notice of the fact that, at the time that Plaintiffs were evaluated for credible \nfear, 47% of those who received a negative credible fear determination sought review by an \nimmigration judge, and only 20% of those were overturned upon review.

USCIS’s “Lesson Plan On Credible Fear Of Persecution And Torture \nDeterminations” \nGiven the significance of the credible fear determination with respect to the \nasylum process, it is not surprising that Congress has authorized the agency that is \nresponsible for executing immigration policy (that is, DHS) to “establish such \nregulations” as it deems “necessary for carrying out” the asylum-screening process \ndescribed above, see 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(3), and also to “issue such instructions” as are \nnecessary to “control, direct[], and supervis[e] . . . all employees” of DHS, so as to \nensure that the complex statutory immigration system is being administered properly, \nid. § 1103(a)(1)–(3).  The importance of proper training for agency officials is \nexpressly acknowledged by statute: the INA specifically states that training must be \nprovided for all “officers adjudicating asylum cases under section 1158[,]” id. \n§ 1157(f), and with respect to the “asylum officer[s]” who conduct credible fear \ninterviews in particular, the INA requires such officers to receive “professional training \nin country conditions, asylum law, and interview techniques comparable to that \nprovided to full-time adjudicators of [asylum] applications[,]” id. § 1225(b)(1)(E)(i).  \nDHS has also promulgated regulations that require asylum officers to receive “special \ntraining in international human rights law, nonadversarial interview techniques, and \nother relevant national and international refugee laws and principles.”  8 C.F.R. \n§ 208.1(b).  Indeed, “[a]s of February 2020, training for [USCIS] asylum officers \nconsisted of at least 9 weeks of formal training and 3 to 4 weeks of additional credible \nfear training for asylum officers in offices with heavy credible fear caseloads[,]” as well \nas “4 hours per week of ongoing training.”  A.B.-B. v. Morgan, No. 20-cv-846, 2020 \nWL 5107548, at *7 (D.D.C. Aug. 31, 2020). \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 14 of 99\nIn accordance with its statutory and regulatory obligation to train its asylum \nofficers, USCIS publishes a guidance document that it calls the “Lesson Plan on \nCredible Fear of Persecution and Torture Determinations.”  (See Lesson Plan at 2–38.)  \nTo this Court’s knowledge, there have been at least six versions of this particular \nLesson Plan, dated April 14, 2006 (see ECF No. 61-3, at 2), March 7, 2013 (see ECF \nNo. 61-5, at 2–40), February 28, 2014 (see ECF No. 61-4, at 2–48), February 13, 2017 \n(ECF No. 61-2, at 2–48), April 30, 2019 (see ECF No. 61-1, at 2–38), and September \n30, 2019 (see ECF No. 58-1, at 2–39).  The April 2019 version of the Lesson Plan was \nin effect when asylum officers made the adverse credible fear determinations in \nPlaintiffs’ cases.  (See Am. Compl. ¶ 8.)5   \nThe April 2019 Lesson Plan is 37 pages long, and is divided into eleven sections.  \nAt the outset, the document purports “to explain how to determine whether an alien \nsubject to expedited removal or an arriving stowaway has a credible fear of persecution \nor torture[,]” so that asylum officers “will be able to correctly make a credible fear \ndetermination consistent with the statutory provisions, regulations, policies, and \nprocedures that govern whether the applicant has established a credible fear of \npersecution or a credible fear of torture.”  (Lesson Plan at 2.)  The Lesson Plan then \nproceeds to instruct asylum officers how to “[i]dentify which persons are subject to \nexpedited removal” (id.; see id. at 7–10), and then discusses the function of the credible \n \n5 Plaintiffs have requested that their claims with respect to the allegedly unlawful aspects of the April \n2019 Lesson Plan be applied to the now-effective September 2019 version of the Lesson Plan as well, \ngiven that the document did not change in any relevant respect when the September 2019 version \nissued.  (See Pls.’ Mot. for Leave to File Suppl. Pleading, ECF No. 62.)  The Court granted Plaintiffs’ \nrequest on October 31, 2020 (see Minute Order of Oct. 31, 2020), and accordingly, throughout this \nMemorandum Opinion, any references to the “Lesson Plan” should be construed as a reference to both \nversions of that document (April 2019 and September 2019). \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 15 of 99\nfear screening (see id. at 10), followed by a description of the concept of a “credible \nfear” of persecution or torture that also addresses the standard of proof required to \nestablish a credible fear (see id. 10–14).  In this regard, the Lesson Plan specifically \ninstructs that “the credible fear significant possibility standard of proof . . . requires the \napplicant to identify more than significant evidence that the applicant is a refugee \nentitled to asylum” (id. at 13 (internal quotation marks omitted)), and that, “even where \nthe officer might otherwise find the testimony credible[,]” an asylum officer can require \nthe credible fear interviewee to “provide evidence that corroborates the applicant’s \ntestimony” (id. at 12).  The Lesson Plan focuses next on the procedures for making a \ncredible fear determination: it directs asylum officers how to evaluate credibility in a \ncredible fear interview (see id. at 14–18), and identifies the “elements” that are \nnecessary for establishing a credible fear of persecution (see id. at 19–26) or a credible \nfear of torture (see id. at 26–32).  The document also states that, “[i]n order to establish \na credible fear of persecution, the applicant must establish each one of the elements” of \nher asylum claim.  (Id. at 20.)  It then moves on to addressing auxiliary matters such as \nthe applicability of bars to asylum (see id. at 32–33), and the treatment of dependents \n(see id. at 33–34), before closing with a summary overview (see id. at 35–38). \nC.  Plaintiffs’ Asylum-Related Experiences  \nBeginning in the spring of 2019, at around the same time as the USCIS issued the \nApril 2019 version of the Lesson Plan, the five individual plaintiffs in this case were \ndeemed subject to expedited removal, after which they expressed an intention to apply \nfor asylum.  Each Plaintiff then proceeded to have a credible fear screening interview \nwith a USCIS asylum officer, and each was found not to have a credible fear of \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 16 of 99\npersecution, notwithstanding the alleged circumstances under which she had left her \nhome country and arrived in the United States.  What follows is a brief recounting of \nthe complaint’s allegations concerning each Plaintiff’s asylum-related experiences, as \nwell as her efforts to challenge the adverse credible fear determination that prevented \nher from proceeding to the full asylum application review process.   \n1.  Maria Kiakombua \nPlaintiff Maria Kiakombua allegedly “fled her home in Angola to escape her \nboyfriend, a member of the country’s military, who beat her—sometimes with a \nmachete—and threatened to kill her if she left him” (Compl., ECF No. 1, ¶ 8), and to \nfind refuge from “repeated attacks . . . at the hands of government officials” (id.), who \nwere “associated with Ms. Kiakombua’s boyfriend [and] came to her home and raped \nher in the presence of her children, due in part to her failure to abide by societal norms \nregarding the proper role and behavior of women” (id. ¶ 12).  According to the \ncomplaint, Kiakombua “reached the U.S. border and sought asylum” in April of 2019, \n“but an asylum officer found that she lacked a credible fear under the Lesson Plan.”  \n(Id. ¶¶ 8, 12.)  In May of 2019, “[a]n immigration judge subsequently agreed” with the \nasylum officer’s conclusion (id. ¶ 13), and Kiakombua was then “detained in the \ncustody of the Department of Homeland Security” pending removal to Angola (id. \n¶ 12).  On June 6, 2019, through “the assistance of pro bono immigration consultant[,]” \nKiakombua sought “reconsideration of the asylum officer’s negative credible fear \ndetermination” (Am. Compl. ¶ 15), but that request was denied after a follow-up \ninterview (see id. ¶ 16).   \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 17 of 99\nKiakombua filed the instant lawsuit on June 25, 2019.  (See id. ¶ 17.)  The \nfollowing day Kiakombua (through counsel) “requested that Defendants voluntarily \nagree to stay [her] expedited removal, to obviate the need for Ms. Kiakombua to request \nthat relief from the Court” (id. ¶ 18), and one day later, on June 27, 2019, USCIS \nnotified Kiakombua that the agency “had sua sponte reconsidered its prior denial of her \nJune 6, 2019[,] request for reconsideration, and had found that Ms. Kiakombua has a \ncredible fear” (id. ¶ 19).  Kiakombua remains detained in USCIS custody (see id. ¶ 13), \nand has apparently been served with a Notice to Appear for full removal proceedings at \na date and time “TBD” (see Sealed Ex. D to Defs.’ Reply (“Kiakombua NTA”), ECF \nNo. 4, at 2). \nOn June 28, 2019, Kiakombua’s counsel filed an amended complaint that names \nfour additional plaintiffs, each of whom is proceeding under a pseudonym.  (See Am. \nCompl. ¶¶ 20, 22, 24, 26.)6  \n2.  “Sofia” and “Julia” \nSofia is a Cuban “medical doctor” who is married to a U.S. lawful permanent \nresident.  (Id. ¶ 24.)  Sofia allegedly “opposes Cuba’s ruling party, [and] has made her \nviews known through her political positions and refusal to acquiesce in demands of \ngovernment officials.”  (Id.)  According to the amended complaint, the Cuban \ngovernment “has accused [Sofia] of being anti-revolutionary and subjected her to \n \n6 These four plaintiffs filed a motion to proceed pseudonymously on June 28, 2019.  (See Pls.’ Mot. for \nLeave to Proceed Under Pseudonyms, ECF No. 7.)  The Court granted this motion, and determined that, \n“[w]hen weighed against the minimal interest in disclosure of the identities of the Pseudonymous \nPlaintiffs, the Pseudonymous Plaintiffs’ significant interest in maintaining anonymity at this early stage \nin the litigation is more than sufficient to overcome any general presumption in favor of open \nproceedings.”  (See Order, ECF No. 12, at 9.)   \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 18 of 99\nsurveillance, threats, and detention[,]” and “[t]he fear and stress Sofia experienced as a \nresult of the Cuban government’s actions led her to miscarry a pregnancy and ultimately \nto decide to flee to the United States immediately, rather than risk waiting in Cuba until \nher husband’s petition [on her behalf] was processed.”  (Id.)  Sofia came to the United \nStates in April of 2019, seeking asylum, but an “asylum officer determined—pursuant \nto a credible fear process governed by the unlawful standards and procedures contained \nin the Lesson Plan, and after an interview that lasted under ninety minutes, including \ninterpretation—that Sofia lacked a credible fear of persecution or torture.”  (Id. ¶ 25.)  \n“An immigration judge subsequently agreed” and Sofia’s request for reconsideration \nwas denied (id.); thus, Sofia “was deported to Cuba, where she has been questioned by \nthe authorities about why she fled[,]” and where she “lives in constant fear of further \ngovernmental threats and harassment” (id.).  \nAccording to the amended complaint, Julia has also been deported back to her \nhome country (El Salvador) after a negative credible fear determination in May of 2019 \nthat was subsequently affirmed by an immigration judge.  (See id. ¶ 27.)  Julia allegedly \n“fled El Salvador after witnessing the murder of a neighbor committed by gang \nmembers” and after receiving multiple death threats from that gang “if she reported \ntheir crime to the police.”  (Id. ¶ 26.)  The amended complaint alleges that Julia came to \nthe United States seeking protection in April of 2019, but an asylum officer determined \nthat she “lacked a credible fear of persecution or torture” under the newly revised \nLesson Plan.  (Id. ¶¶ 26–27.) \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 19 of 99\n3.  “Ana” and “Emma” \nAna was allegedly “forced to flee El Salvador after receiving death threats from \ngang members who targeted her husband, [who is] a landowner, and his family.”  (Id. \n¶ 20.)  According to the amended complaint, “[i]n addition to sending death threats to \n[Ana], the gang members threatened several other family members and shot her husband \nand her nine-year-old granddaughter, although both survived.”  (Id.)  The local “police \nwere of little assistance” and, therefore, in May of 2019, Ana sought refuge in the \nUnited States.  (Id.)  After “an asylum officer determined[,]” allegedly pursuant to the \nLesson Plan, “that Ana lacked a credible fear of persecution or torture[,]” and “[a]n \nimmigration judge subsequently agreed[,]” Ana was detained pending removal.  (Id. \n¶ 21.)   \nEmma also allegedly “fled El Salvador fearing for her life and came to the \nUnited States seeking protection in May [of] 2019.”  (Id. ¶ 22.)  According to the \namended complaint, Emma was “beaten and sexually abused by her brother[,]” and was \nalso “threatened and emotionally and physically abused by the father of her daughter[,]” \nbut she was unable to report him to the local authorities because of his “close \nassociations with the police.”  (Id.)  The amended complaint alleges that, in June of \n2019, an asylum officer determined pursuant to the Lesson Plan “that Emma lacked a \ncredible fear of persecution or torture[,]” and Emma has been ordered detained pending \n“her hearing with an immigration judge, who will review the negative decision issued \nby the asylum officer.”  (Id. ¶ 23.)   \nOn July 8, 2019, Plaintiffs Ana and Emma filed an emergency motion for an \nadministrative stay of their impending removals (see Pls.’ Mot. for Admin. Stay of \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 20 of 99\nRemoval, ECF No. 13, at 1), which this Court granted—over Defendants’ objection on \njurisdictional grounds (see Defs.’ Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. for Admin. Stay of Removal, ECF \nNo. 16)—“pending resolution of th[e] Court’s determination of whether it has \njurisdiction to enter a stay of removal in this case” (Order, ECF No. 18, at 2 (citing \nOrder Granting Temporary Stay of Removal, Grace v. Whitaker, No. 18-cv-1853, ECF \nNo. 21)).  The next day, on July 9, 2019, an immigration judge purportedly determined \nthat Emma’s negative credible fear determination should be vacated (see Ex. A to \nDefs.’ Mot. (“In the Matter of Emma”), ECF No. 31-3, at 2), and it appears that around \nthat same time Ana’s negative credible fear determination was reversed by the agency \nsua sponte.  Shortly thereafter, Notices to Appear for full removal proceedings at a date \nand time “TBD” were issued to both Ana and Emma.  (See Sealed Ex. A to Defs.’ \nNotice of Sealed Filing (“Ana’s NTA”), ECF No. 81-1, at 2; Ex. B to Defs.’ Notice of \nSealed Filing (“Emma’s NTA”), ECF No. 81-2, at 2.) \nD.  Procedural History \nAs mentioned above, Kiakombua filed her original complaint on June 25, 2019 \n(see Compl., ECF No. 1), and Ana, Emma, Sofia, and Julia joined with Kiakombua to \nfile an amended complaint three days later (see First Am. Compl., ECF No. 6), which \nwas subsequently supplemented and superseded (see Suppl. First Am. Compl. (“Am. \nCompl.”), ECF No. 62-2).7  Their pleading alleges that the asylum officers who \n \n7 There are no material differences between the first amended complaint and the supplemented first \namended complaint.  (See Ex. 2 to Pls.’ Mot. for Leave to File Suppl. Pleading, ECF No. 62-3 \n(including a redline comparing the first amended complaint to the supplemented first amended \ncomplaint).)  Accordingly, and consistent with this Court’s Minute Order of October 31, 2020, any \nreference and citation throughout this Memorandum Opinion to the “Amended Complaint” should be \nconstrued as referring to the “Supplemented First Amended Complaint.”   \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 21 of 99\nundertook to make their credible fear determinations relied on the April 2019 Lesson \nPlan (see id. ¶¶ 14, 21, 23, 25, 27), and that the Lesson Plan’s credible fear guidance is \nunlawful for three “independent” reasons (Pls.’ Mot. at 39).    \n1.  Plaintiffs’ Legal Claims \nPlaintiffs’ “First Claim for Relief” (see Am. Compl. ¶¶ 89–98) is brought under \nsection 1252(e)(3) of the INA: Plaintiffs allege that the Lesson Plan is one of the \nagency’s written policies that is made reviewable pursuant to section 1252(e)(3) of the \nINA, and that it must be “vacated” upon review (id. ¶ 98), because it is both not \n“consistent with applicable provisions of [Subchapter II of the INA]” (id. ¶ 90 (quoting \n8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(A)(ii)) (alteration in original)), as amended by the Refugee Act \n(see id. ¶ 92), and “otherwise in violation of law” (id. ¶ 90 (quoting 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(e)(3)(A)(ii)), insofar as it violates the arbitrary-and-capricious prohibition of the \nAPA (see id. ¶¶ 91, 96), the Convention Against Torture and its implementing \nregulations (see id. ¶ 93), and “customary international law” (id. ¶¶ 94–95).  \nPlaintiffs’ “Second Claim for Relief” (id. ¶¶ 99–103) invokes section 706(2)(D) \nof the APA, which authorizes courts to hold “unlawful and set aside” agency actions \nthat fail “to observe the procedure required by the APA” (id. ¶ 103 (citing 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(D)).  In this regard, the amended complaint alleges that the APA “requires \nagency action that is substantive (or ‘legislative’) in nature to follow notice-and-\ncomment procedures” (id. ¶ 100), and that, even though the Lesson Plan “reflects one or \nmore substantive rules” (id. ¶ 101), “Defendants did not follow notice-and-comment \nrulemaking procedures” (id. ¶ 102). \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 22 of 99\nPlaintiffs’ “Third Claim for Relief” invokes the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution.  (Id. ¶¶ 104–108.)  Plaintiffs allege that they have \na constitutionally “protected interest . . . in not being removed to countries where they \nface serious danger, persecution, and potential loss of life” (id. ¶ 105), and that, \nalthough the Due Process Clause entitles them to a “fair hearing of their claims, and a \nmeaningful opportunity to establish their potential eligibility for asylum and other \nforms of relief from removal” (id. ¶ 106), the Lesson Plan violates those rights by \n“subjecting [Plaintiffs’] claims to unlawful, more burdensome legal standards” (id. \n¶ 107), and therefore should “be enjoined” (id. ¶ 108).  \nBased on these alternative grounds for relief, Plaintiffs seek various remedies \n(see Am. Compl. at 26–27 (“Prayer for Relief”)), including: (1) a declaration that the \nLesson Plan, all related guidance documents, and all credible fear proceedings \nundertaken pursuant to the Lesson Plan are not consistent with the INA (see id. ¶ 4); \n(2) an order vacating the entire Lesson Plan and prospectively enjoining its use (see id. \n¶¶ 5–6); (3) vacatur of any negative credible fear determinations and removal orders \nissued to Plaintiffs, and injunctive relief to provide them with new credible fear \nscreenings or, in the alternative, to place them in full removal proceedings (see id. ¶¶ 3, \n7); and (4) as to Plaintiffs Sofia and Julia, who were deported, injunctive relief to \neither parole them into the United States and provide them new credible fear interviews \nunder the correct legal standards (see id. ¶ 7), or, alternatively, place them in full \nremoval proceedings (see id.).   \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 23 of 99\n2.  The Parties’ Cross-Motions For Summary Judgment \nFollowing this Court’s administrative stay of Plaintiffs Ana’s and Emma’s \nremovals (see Order, ECF No. 18), the parties agreed to file cross-motions for summary \njudgment in lieu of separately briefing various jurisdictional issues that Defendants \nintended to raise concerning these Plaintiffs’ request for a stay of removal (see Defs.’ \nMot., ECF No. 31-1; Pls.’ Mot., ECF No. 36-1).  The parties’ cross-motions ripened on \nOctober 10, 2019.  (See Defs.’ Reply, ECF No. 49; Pls.’ Reply, ECF No. 60.)8   \nIn their motion for summary judgment, which takes a kitchen-sink approach, \nDefendants first raise a number of threshold arguments concerning Plaintiffs’ lack of \nArticle III standing and the Court’s lack of subject-matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ \nclaims.  They argue, for example, that this Court “should dismiss the Amended \nComplaint because no Plaintiff has standing to challenge the Lesson Plan.”  (Defs.’ \nMot. at 24.)  They also maintain that “the INA precludes the Court from exercising \njurisdiction over this case[,]” because (1) “the Lesson Plan does not ‘implement’ the \nexpedited removal statute” for the purpose of section 1252(e)(3)(A)(ii) (id. at 30), or \n(2) “the Lesson Plan is not a statute, regulation, policy directive, policy guideline, or \nprocedure” within the meaning of section 1252(e)(3)(A)(ii) (id. at 30–31), or (3) the \nLesson Plan does not meet the “jurisdictional requirement that these challenges be filed \n‘no later than 60 days after the date the challenged [action] . . . is first implemented’” \n(Defs.’ Reply at 17 (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(B))).  Over the course of multiple \n \n8 In addition, on September 20 and 27, 2020, three organizations filed amicus briefs in support of \nPlaintiffs’ position: the Advocates for Human Rights (see ECF No. 46); the National Citizenship and \nImmigration Services Council 119 (see ECF No. 47); and the Tahirih Justice Center (see ECF No. 55).  \nThe Immigration Reform Law Institute filed an amicus brief in support of Defendants on August 30, \n2019.  (See ECF No. 35.) \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 24 of 99\nfilings submitted over many months, Defendants have also pressed another independent \nground for dismissal: that the entire dispute is moot, because “Defendants have placed \n[Kiakombua, Ana, and Emma] into full § 1229a removal proceedings by filing a ‘Notice \nto Appear’” (Defs.’ Reply at 13; see also Defs.’ Status Update on Mootness (“Defs.’ \nMootness Notice”), ECF No. 80, at 1–2), and because Sofia and Julia “have been \nremoved” (Defs.’ Mootness Notice at 4).   \nWith respect to the merits of Plaintiffs’ claims, Defendants generally contend \nthat “the Lesson Plan is not actionable under either the APA or the INA[,]” because it is \nnothing more than “a training module that agency instructors are supposed to use to \ntrain asylum officers to correctly make credible fear determinations consistent with \napplicable law.”  (Defs.’ Mot. at 37.)  Defendants further argue, more specifically, that \nthe Lesson Plan is not a “‘rule’ as defined in the APA” (id.); does not “impose \nobligations or confer rights on anybody” (id.); has “no legal significance” (id.); and is \nnot “final” within the meaning of the APA, and is therefore not subject to APA review \n(id.).  Additionally, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ INA claim fails because the \nLesson Plan does not “misstate the immigration statutes and DHS’s own regulations” \n(id. at 48) and, instead, “reasonably portrays asylum and CAT law” (id. at 51).  \nFurthermore, according to Defendants, while Plaintiffs’ “due process claim also fails on \nthe merits” (id. at 60), Plaintiffs have not satisfied the threshold requirement of \nestablishing that “the Lesson Plan falls short of the minimum constitutional procedures \n[the immigration] statutes purport to provide” (id. at 59 (citation omitted)).  Lastly, \nDefendants maintain that, even if the Court agrees with Plaintiffs on the merits, the \nCourt “may only determine the Lesson Plan’s lawfulness, and lacks statutory authority \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 25 of 99\nto enjoin or vacate the Lesson Plan or stay removals.”  (Id. at 63; see also id. at 67 \n(arguing that, accordingly, “the Court should dissolve its earlier stay [of removal] \norder”).)  \nPlaintiffs’ cross-motion for summary judgment argues that each Plaintiff has “the \npersonal stake necessary to establish standing” under Article III, because each has \nreceived a negative credible fear determination, and because “all five had their \nprotection claims evaluated under the Lesson Plan” that is being challenged in this \naction.  (Pls.’ Mot. at 32.)  Thus, Plaintiffs say that their injuries are “traceable” to the \nLesson Plan and can be remedied by the Court.  (Id.)  Plaintiffs also argue that this \nCourt has jurisdiction over their claims, either pursuant to the express terms of section \n1252(e)(3) of the INA, or pursuant to section 1331 of Title 28, given that section 1252 \n“as a whole” does not strip the Court’s section 1331 jurisdiction in this context.  (Id. at \n30 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).)  Plaintiffs further reject \nDefendants’ contention that their claims have become moot as “utterly meritless[.]”  \n(Pls.’ Resp. to Defs.’ Mootness Notice, ECF No. 82, at 1.)  And as to the merits of their \nclaims, Plaintiffs contend that Defendants’ arguments for why “the Lesson Plan is \nunreviewable” under the APA are all “red herrings” (Pls.’ Mot. at 36) and, in any event, \nthat the Court can set aside the Lesson Plan “on numerous independent grounds,” \nincluding that: (1) “it is not consistent with the governing [immigration] statutes and \nregulations” (id. at 39); (2) “it was revised in an arbitrary and capricious manner” and \n(3) “it was required to, but did not, go through notice and comment rulemaking” (id.); \nand (4) “it is not consistent with due process” (id.).  Finally, in closing, Plaintiffs argue \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 26 of 99\nthat section 1252 “does not curtail this Court’s [traditional] authority to issue a [full] \nremedy” in this case.  (Id. at 63.)  \nThe Court held a motions hearing on October 22, 2019 (see Minute Entry of Oct. \n22, 2019), after which it ordered the parties to file supplemental briefs on the issue of \nremedies, with a particular focus on whether the entire Lesson Plan had to be vacated if \nPlaintiffs were successful or whether the allegedly unlawful provisions of the Lesson \nPlan were severable from the remainder of the document.  (See Pls.’ Suppl. Br. on \nSeverability, ECF No. 68; Defs.’ Suppl. Br. on Severability, ECF No. 69.)  The Court \nsubsequently administratively stayed its consideration of the parties’ cross-motions and \nsupplemental briefs, pending the D.C. Circuit’s decision in Grace v. Barr (“Grace II”), \n965 F.3d 883 (D.C. Cir. 2020).  (See Minute Order of Mar. 5, 2020 (noting that Grace \nII “present[ed] threshold issues concerning the meaning of various statutory terms” \nunder the INA, and “substantially similar questions of law arise in the context of the \npresent dispute”).)  The D.C. Circuit released its opinion in Grace II on July 17, 2020, \nafter which this Court lifted its stay and ordered supplemental briefs on the impact of \nGrace II with respect to the instant dispute.  (See Minute Order of July 22, 2020; see \nalso Defs.’ Suppl. Brief Regarding Grace v. Barr (“Defs.’ Grace Brief”), ECF No. 72; \nPls.’ Suppl. Brief Regarding Grace (“Pls.’ Grace Brief”), ECF No. 76; Pls.’ Suppl. \nResponsive Brief Regarding Grace (“Pls.’ Grace Reply”), ECF No. 77; Defs.’ Reply \nSuppl. Brief Regarding Grace v. Barr (“Defs.’ Grace Reply”), ECF No. 78.)  The \nparties’ cross-motions for summary judgment are now ripe for decision.   \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 27 of 99\nIII.  LEGAL STANDARDS \nAlthough Defendants’ motion is formally styled as a motion for summary \njudgment (see Defs.’ Mot. at 1), Defendants vigorously contend, as threshold matter, \nthat “the Court lacks jurisdiction over this case and should dismiss it” (id. at 36).  \nConsequently, Defendants’ cross-motion is best construed as a motion to dismiss for \nlack of subject-matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) or, in the alternative, a motion \nfor summary judgment under Rule 56(a).  See, e.g., Kirkham v. Société Air France, 429 \nF.3d 288, 291 (D.C. Cir. 2005); see also 10A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & \nMary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2713 (4th ed. 2020) (“[T]he label \nattached to the motion should not prevent the court from deciding a summary-judgment \nmotion challenging the court’s subject-matter jurisdiction as a suggestion that the court \ndismiss the action on that ground.”).  Thus, the legal standards for both Rule 12(b)(1) \nmotions to dismiss and Rule 56 motions for summary judgment apply in the instant \ncircumstances.  \nA.  Motions To Dismiss Under Federal Rule Of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1)—which authorizes a party to challenge \nby motion the “lack of subject-matter jurisdiction[,]” Fed.

Supp. 2d 9, 13 (D.D.C. 2001).  “The requirement that jurisdiction be \nestablished as a threshold matter springs from the nature and limits of the judicial \npower of the United States and is inflexible and without exception.”  Steel Co. v. \nCitizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 94–95 (1998) (internal quotation marks and \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 28 of 99\nalterations omitted); see also Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 375, \n377 (1994) (explaining that “[f]ederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction” and, \nthus, “possess only that power authorized by Constitution and statute”).   \nThe doctrines of standing, mootness, and ripeness are “[t]hree inter-related” \ndoctrines that determine the “constitutional boundaries” of a court’s jurisdiction.  Worth \nv. Jackson, 451 F.3d 854, 855, 857 (D.C. Cir. 2006).  Indeed, “the defect of standing is \na defect in subject matter jurisdiction[,]” Haase v. Sessions, 835 F.2d 902, 906 (D.C. \nCir. 1987), and so, too, is a motion to dismiss for mootness “properly brought under \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1)[,]” Friends of Animals v. Salazar, 670 F. \nSupp. 2d 7, 11 (D.D.C. 2009).  Likewise, because a court’s subject-matter jurisdiction \nis “a statutory requirement[,]” Akinseye v. District of Columbia, 339 F.3d 970, 971 \n(D.C. Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), “congressional \npreclusion of judicial review is in effect jurisdictional” as well, Block v. Cmty. \nNutrition Inst., 467 U.S. 340, 353 n.4 (1984). \nWhen ruling on a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, a court must “treat the complaint’s \nfactual allegations as true” and afford the plaintiff “the benefit of all inferences that can \nbe derived from the facts alleged.”  Delta Air Lines, Inc. v. Exp.-Imp. Bank of U.S., 85 \nF. Supp. 3d 250, 259 (D.D.C. 2015) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  \nHowever, those factual allegations receive “closer scrutiny” than they would in the Rule \n12(b)(6) context.  Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Moreover, unlike \na Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the court may look to documents outside of the complaint in \norder to evaluate whether or not it has jurisdiction to entertain a claim.  See Jerome \nStevens Pharms., Inc. v. F.D.A., 402 F.3d 1249, 1253 (D.C. Cir. 2005).  If the court \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 29 of 99\ndetermines that the plaintiff lacks standing, or a claim is moot because it no longer \npresents a live controversy, or the court has no statutory jurisdiction, then the court \nlacks subject-matter jurisdiction to entertain the claim and must dismiss it.  See Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 12(b)(1), (h)(3).  \nB.  Rule 56 Motions For Summary Judgment With Respect To Legal \nClaims That Assail Agency Action Under The APA And Otherwise \nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, if a case raises “no genuine \ndispute as to any material fact[,]” courts will ordinarily enter summary judgment in \nfavor of the party that “is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n56(a).  And if both parties file cross-motions for summary judgment concerning issues \nthat “are purely legal in nature[,]” then “the entry of summary judgment for the party \nentitled to prevail as a matter of law is appropriate.”  Teva Pharms., Indus., Ltd. v. \nF.D.A., 355 F. Supp. 2d 111, 116 (D.D.C. 2004), aff’d, 410 F.3d 51 (D.C. Cir. 2005).  \nBut see Barr Labs., Inc. v. Thompson, 238 F. Supp. 2d 236, 244 (D.D.C. 2002) \n(explaining, with respect to cross-motions for summary judgment, that “the court shall \ngrant summary judgment only if one of the moving parties is entitled to judgment as a \nmatter of law upon material facts that are not genuinely disputed”).     \nNotably, with respect to cross-motions for summary judgment concerning legal \nclaims that challenge agency action under the APA, the respective duties of the agency \nand the court are well established: “it is the role of the agency to resolve factual issues \nto arrive at a decision that is supported by the administrative record, whereas the \nfunction of the district court is to determine whether or not as a matter of law the \nevidence in the administrative record permitted the agency to make the decision it did.”  \nCatholic Health Initiatives v. Sebelius, 658 F. Supp. 2d 113, 117 (D.D.C. 2009) \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 30 of 99\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  However, if a plaintiff alleges that an \nagency has engaged in conduct that directly contravenes a substantive statute that has a \ncause of action for that violation—such as claims brought under section 1252(e)(3) of \nthe INA for agency conduct that is “not consistent with applicable provisions of this \nsubchapter [of the INA] or is otherwise in violation of law,” 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(e)(3)(A)(ii)—“the Court is not limited to the administrative record in \nconducting its legal analysis[,]” and “must take into account relevant legal authority, \nincluding statutes, regulations, and agency authority[,]” Nio v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., \n385 F. Supp. 3d 44, 59 (D.D.C. 2019).  Those legal authorities are binding on both the \ncourt and the agency, and the court will analyze them to determine which party, if any, \nis entitled to judgment as a matter of law with respect to the plaintiff’s challenge to the \nagency’s administrative action.  \nIV.  ANALYSIS \nThe central question at issue in the instant case is whether the Lesson Plan’s \nvarious pronouncements concerning the manner in which USCIS asylum officers are to \nmake credible fear determinations are irreconcilable with the statutory and regulatory \nprovisions that govern those screenings (see Am. Compl. ¶¶ 89–98) or, alternatively, \nwhether USCIS has violated other procedural or constitutional requirements (see id. \n¶¶ 99–108) with respect to the Lesson Plan’s promulgation or its contents.  As now \nhappens with fair frequency, Defendants have presented a slew of arguments concerning \nvarious potential threshold impediments to the Court’s consideration of the merits of \nPlaintiffs’ legal claims (see generally Defs.’ Mot. at 24–36)—sometimes all within a \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 31 of 99\nsingle paragraph.9  The Court’s evaluation of these sometimes conflated contentions has \nrequired a methodical analysis of myriad legal issues, some of which the D.C. Circuit \nhas recently considered as well.   \nUltimately, as explained below, the Court has determined that each of \nDefendants’ threshold arguments fails, and that several provisions of the Lesson Plan \nare patently at odds with the credible fear screening scheme that Congress has crafted.  \nNotably this fundamental flaw in the agency’s training materials manifests itself in \nvarious ways—e.g., at times, USCIS has imported the standards and burdens that apply \nonly during full removal proceedings into the expedited removal screening process; at \nother times, the agency makes pronouncements about the law that clash with the \napplicable provisions of the INA itself.  And because the unlawful provisions of the \nLesson Plan cannot be effectively severed from the remainder of the document, the \nCourt will exercise its standard equitable authority to vacate the entire Lesson Plan and \nrequire USCIS to make new credible fear determinations with respect to each Plaintiff. \n \n9 Defendants’ “Status Update on Mootness” (ECF No. 80) provides but one example of this muddled \napproach.  In a document that purports to address the mootness of Plaintiffs’ claims, Defendants write:  \nThe claims of the remaining two Plaintiffs, Sofia and Julia, are also moot because \nthey have been removed, as Defendants have already explained.  Additionally, Sofia \nand Julia no longer have standing separately for each claim she seeks to press and \nfor form of relief sought.  Sofia and Julia still need to have a live controversy as to \nthem—i.e., that their alleged injuries would be cured by the Court vacating their \ncredible fear determinations and ordering a new credible fear determination, based \non one or more out of the nine challenged provisions being unlawful as applied to \nthem.  As previously explained, Sofia and Julia cannot identify what parts of the \noperative Lesson Plan will be applied to them, nor can they establish that they have \na likelihood of receiving a negative credible fear determination from USCIS or from \nan immigration judge not following the Lesson Plan.  Their claims are moot, and to \nthe extent they are not, relief must be limited to the injuries Sofia and Julia can \nshow (e.g., which of the nine challenged Lesson Plan provisions are injuring them). \n(Defs.’ Mootness Notice at 4–5 (internal quotation marks, citations, and alterations omitted).)  Each of \nthese myriad assertions must be untangled from the others before it can be properly analyzed.   \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 32 of 99\nA.  Plaintiffs Have Article III Standing To Challenge The Lesson Plan, \nAnd Defendants Have Not Established That Plaintiffs’ Claims Are \nMoot \n1.  Plaintiffs Suffered An Injury In Fact, Which Is Fairly Traceable To \nThe Lesson Plan, And May Be Redressed By An Order Vacating \nThe Lesson Plan And Requiring New Credible Fear Determinations \nDefendants’ opening salvo is the contention that “no Plaintiff has standing to \nchallenge the Lesson Plan.”  (Defs.’ Mot. at 24.)  Thus, the Court begins by assessing \nwhether any Plaintiff has, in fact, demonstrated the “irreducible constitutional \nminimum” circumstances necessary to invoke a federal court’s subject-matter \njurisdiction over a lawsuit, Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016) \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted), which consist of three elements: injury \nin fact, causation, and redressability, see Dominguez v. UAL Corp., 666 F.3d 1359, \n1362 (D.C. Cir. 2012); see also J.D. v. Azar, 925 F.3d 1291, 1323–24 (D.C. Cir. 2019) \n(“It is settled that in a case involving joined, individual plaintiffs bringing a shared \nclaim seeking a single remedy, Article III’s case-or-controversy requirement is satisfied \nif one plaintiff can establish injury and standing.” (internal citation omitted)).  As \nfurther explained below, Plaintiffs are asylum seekers who underwent credible fear \ninterviews and who maintain that USCIS evaluators applied the unlawful provisions \ncontained in the Lesson Plan to determine that each Plaintiff lacked a credible fear.  \nTherefore, it is clear to this Court that Plaintiffs have suffered an injury in fact that is \nfairly traceable to the challenged Lesson Plan and that is likely to be redressed by a \nfavorable ruling of this Court.  \nTo start, there is no serious dispute that these Plaintiffs—who, again, allege that \nUSCIS officers evaluated their asylum requests pursuant to unlawful Lesson Plan \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 33 of 99\nprovisions, after which each Plaintiff was slated for expedited removal from the United \nStates based upon the officers’ negative credible fear determinations—have adequately \nidentified an injury in fact.  This is because it is well established that a plaintiff has \nstanding to bring a claim concerning a procedural injury if she can show that the agency \nfailed to abide by a procedural requirement that was “designed to protect some \nthreatened concrete interest” of the plaintiff.  Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, \n573 n.8 (1992); see also, e.g., Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 280 n.14 \n(1978) (concluding that an applicant for admission had standing to challenge a \nuniversity’s affirmative action admissions program even though the applicant “had been \nunable to prove that he would have been admitted in the absence of the [challenged] \nprogram”); Grace v. Whitaker (“Grace I”), 344 F. Supp. 3d 96, 119 (D.D.C. 2018), \naff’d in relevant part, Grace II, 965 F.3d 883 (holding that plaintiffs had suffered an \ninjury in fact because they alleged that new “credible fear policies impermissibly raise \ntheir burden and deny plaintiffs a fair opportunity to seek asylum and escape the \npersecution they have suffered”).10   \nConsequently, Defendants’ primary arguments with respect to Article III \nstanding are that these Plaintiffs’ alleged procedural injuries are not fairly traceable to \nthe Lesson Plan, and that, in any event, an order from this Court vacating the Lesson \nPlan and requiring USCIS to undertake new credible fear determinations for these \nPlaintiffs would not actually redress those injuries.  (See Defs.’ Mot. at 27–29; see also \n \n10 Defendants’ contention that Plaintiffs Kiakombua and Emma do not have an injury in fact because, \nsometime after the complaint was filed, the agency revisited and/or vacated the negative credible fear \ndetermination (see Defs.’ Mot. at 25–26) sounds in mootness, not Article III standing.  Thus, it is \naddressed in Section IV.A.2, infra. \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 34 of 99\nDefs.’ Reply at 10–12.). On the traceability front, Defendants attempt to assail the \nfactual basis for Plaintiffs’ claim that it was the Lesson Plan that caused Plaintiffs’ \nalleged injuries; in this regard, Defendants argue that “Plaintiffs have produced zero \nevidence that the Lesson Plan, and the new standards it allegedly pronounced, played \nany role in Plaintiffs’ negative credible fear determinations.”  (Defs.’s Mot. at 27.)  But \n“[a] plaintiff who alleges a deprivation of a procedural protection to which he is \nentitled never has to prove that if he had received the [proper] procedure the substantive \nresult would have been altered.”  Sugar Cane Growers Coop. v. Veneman, 289 F.3d 89, \n94 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  Instead, “[a]ll that is necessary is to show that the procedural step \nwas connected to the substantive result.”  Id. at 95 (emphasis added).  And, here, there \nis ample record evidence that connects the allegedly unlawful Lesson Plan provisions to \nthe credible fear determinations that the agency rendered with respect to each Plaintiff.   \nFor one thing, it is clear that the April 2019 Lesson Plan was binding guidance \nfor USCIS asylum officers at the time that Plaintiffs’ interviews were conducted.  Cf. \nFed. Forest Res. Coal. v. Vilsack, 100 F. Supp. 3d 21, 35 (D.D.C. 2015).  Indeed, the \nApril 2019 Lesson Plan became effective on April 30, 2019 (see Lesson Plan at 2), and \nPlaintiffs’ credible fear determinations took place between May and June of 2019 (see \nAm. Compl., ¶¶ 8, 14, 21, 23, 25, 27).  Moreover, according to DHS, when making \ncredible fear assessments, “Asylum Officers must continue to refer to the latest \napplicable RAIO Lesson Plans for the most recent guidance on determining asylum \neligibility.”  (Ex. 3 to Admin. Record, ECF No. 61-3, at 3.)  Plaintiffs have also offered \nthe sworn declaration of a retired USCIS supervisory asylum officer as proof that the \nofficers do, in fact, reference the Lesson Plan when making credible fear \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 35 of 99\ndeterminations; the declarant explains that the agency “requires” officers to follow the \nLesson Plan, and that USCIS uses it not only as a training material but also for \ndisciplinary purposes.  (Ex. B to Pls.’ Mot., ECF No. 36-3, at 76–78.)  Internal \nmemoranda from DHS further reveal that USCIS performs a quality assurance “review \nof [credible fear] determinations based on the revised lesson plan[.]”  (Ex. 28 to \nAdmin. Record, ECF No. 61-25, at 3 (emphasis added).)  Thus, the Court finds that the \nrecord evidence is sufficient to show that the challenged version of the Lesson Plan was \nin effect at the time that Plaintiffs’ credible fear determinations were made, and that the \nLesson Plan’s prescriptions are binding on USCIS asylum officers, who use them to \ndetermine whether asylum seekers have a credible fear as is necessary to establish their \nasylum eligibility.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs have demonstrated the requisite connection \nbetween the Lesson Plan and their alleged harm, and have therefore established \ntraceability for the purpose of the Article III standing inquiry.  See Mendoza v. Perez, \n754 F.3d 1002, 1012 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (explaining that a plaintiff “need not show the \nagency action would have been different had it been consummated in a procedurally \nvalid manner—the courts will assume this portion of the causal link”). \nDefendants’ redressability argument is likewise unavailing.  Again, Plaintiffs are \nnot asking the Court to require “DHS [to] reach any particular decision” about their \ncredible fear of persecution or torture; instead, they are merely requesting that this \nCourt order that the agency afford the procedures and “the consideration that they are \ndue under the statute.”  Ramirez v. I.C.E., 338 F. Supp. 3d 1, 31 (D.D.C. 2018).  \nDefendants argue nevertheless that Plaintiffs’ alleged injury is not redressable, because \neven if the Court requires USCIS asylum officers to evaluate Plaintiffs’ asylum \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 36 of 99\neligibility without reference to the allegedly tainted Lesson Plan provisions, such an \norder does not pertain to the immigration judge’s subsequent review of the asylum \nofficer’s determination, and thus addresses “only one of two government actions that \nboth independently produce the same alleged harm.”  Kaspersky Lab, Inc. v. Dep’t of \nHomeland Sec., 311 F. Supp. 3d 187, 219 (D.D.C. 2018).  (See also Defs.’ Mot. at 29 \n(emphasizing that “it was the Immigration Judge—not a USCIS asylum officer—who \nmade the ultimate call on whether each Plaintiff had a negative credible fear of \npersecution or torture”).)  In so arguing, Defendants once again misconstrue the \nrelevant injury, which is not the substantive determination regarding each Plaintiff’s \nlack of a credible fear, but the asylum officer’s application of the allegedly unlawful \nLesson Plan when each Plaintiff’s credible fear determination was made.  See Ctr. for \nBiological Diversity v. E.P.A., 861 F.3d 174, 184–85 (D.C. Cir. 2017).  And that harm \noccurred at the point in which the asylum officer referenced the allegedly unlawful \nLesson Plan provisions, so it would be fully redressed by a court order that requires \nnew credible fear interviews for these Plaintiffs conducted by officers who do not rely \nupon such allegedly unlawful standards when Plaintiffs’ asylum eligibility is assessed.11   \n \n11 It is also worth noting that, under the current statutory scheme, the asylum officer’s adverse credible \nfear finding and the immigration judge’s affirmance of that finding are not wholly independent: the \nimmigration judge’s review occurs only after an asylum officer has made a negative credible fear \nfinding, and that review is based primarily, if not exclusively, on the “record of the [asylum officer’s] \nnegative credible fear determination[.]”  8 C.F.R. § 1208.30(g)(2)(ii).  Congress also intended for this \n“de novo” review by the immigration judge to be quite cursory—i.e., “[it] is meant to conclude within \n24 hours” of the adverse credible fear finding, MTRNY II, 962 F.3d at 619—such that, in practice, the \nreview amounts to “simply check[ing] a box on a form stating that the immigration officer’s decision \nwas ‘Affirmed[,]’” Thuraissigiam v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 917 F.3d 1097, 1118 (9th Cir. 2019), \nrev’d on other grounds, 140 S. Ct. 1959 (2020).  Thus, even if the relevant harm was Plaintiffs’ \nnegative credible fear determinations, the interdependent nature of the initial adverse finding and the \nimmigration judge’s review means that the latter cannot be reasonably construed as a separate, \nintervening cause of that injury.    \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 37 of 99\nIn short, if Plaintiffs’ claim that the USCIS asylum officers who undertook to \ndetermine whether they each had a credible fear of persecution or torture could not \nlawfully reference the Lesson Plan when making that determination—as the Court must \nassume for the purpose of evaluating standing, see City of Waukesha v. E.P.A., 320 F.3d \n228, 235 (D.C. Cir. 2003)—then these Plaintiffs (to whom the Lesson Plan was applied \nwith respect to the adverse credible fear determination that each asylum officer made) \nhave established a procedural injury in fact that is fairly traceable to the challenged \nagency action, and which an order of this Court could potentially redress.  \n2.  Defendants Have Not Persuasively Demonstrated Mootness  \nIn the realm of threshold jurisdictional contentions, Defendants also insist that \nsubsequent developments with respect to each Plaintiff have mooted all of the claims \nthat appear in Plaintiffs’ complaint.  (See Defs.’ Reply at 12; see also Defs.’ Mootness \nNotice at 1.)  To hear Defendants tell it, “the challenged Lesson Plan is no longer \ncausing” Plaintiffs Kiakombua, Emma, and Ana “any legally cognizable injury[,]” \nbecause they have “each received the relief they requested” (Defs.’ Reply at 12–13; see \nalso Defs.’ Mootness Notice at 1–4) insofar as USCIS has placed them “into full \n§ 1229a removal proceedings by filing a Notice to Appear” (Defs.’ Reply at 13 (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted)).  At the other end of the spectrum, Defendants \nargue that, because Julia and Sofia “have [already] been removed” from the United \nStates, the consequences of the allegedly tainted adverse credible fear determination \nhave already played out with respect to them, rendering their legal claims moot.  (Defs.’ \nMootness Notice at 4.)  Notably, it is Defendants’ “heavy burden” to show that there is \nno longer any case or controversy with respect to a plaintiff’s claims, Honeywell Int’l, \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 38 of 99\nInc. v. Nuclear Regul. Comm’n, 628 F.3d 568, 576 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (internal quotation \nmarks and citation omitted), and the Supreme Court has made clear that, “[a]s long as \nthe parties have a concrete interest, however small, in the outcome of the litigation, the \ncase is not moot[,]” Chafin v. Chafin, 568 U.S. 165, 172 (2013).  This Court finds that \nDefendants have not carried the heavy burden of establishing mootness, for the \nfollowing reasons. \nFirst of all, Defendants have not demonstrated that Kiakombua, Emma, and Ana \nhave actually been placed into full removal proceedings.  The relevant statutory and \nregulatory provisions plainly establish not only that “[e]very removal proceeding . . . is \ncommenced by the filing of a notice to appear with the immigration court[,]” 8 C.F.R. \n§ 1239.1(a), but also that notice of “the time, place, and date of [the] hearing” must be \ngiven to the noncitizen before the commencement of removal proceedings, 8 C.F.R. \n§ 1003.18(b); see also 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(1) (stating that, “[i]n removal proceedings \nunder section 1229a . . . , written notice (in this section referred to as a ‘notice to \nappear’) shall be given in person to the alien . . . specifying . . . [t]he time and place at \nwhich the proceedings will be held”).  Yet, the Notices to Appear that Defendants have \nprovided to this Court do not contain a time or a date for Plaintiffs’ removal hearings, \nand only Kiakombua’s and Ana’s Notices to Appear have been filed with the \nimmigration court.  (See Kiakombua NTA at 2; Ana’s NTA at 2; Emma’s NTA at 2.)  In \nother contexts, the Supreme Court has made clear that, “[i]f the three words ‘notice to \nappear’ mean anything . . . , they must mean that, at a minimum, the Government has to \nprovide noncitizens ‘notice’ of the information, i.e., the ‘time’ and ‘place,’ that would \nenable them ‘to appear’ at the removal hearing in the first place.”  Pereira v. Sessions, \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 39 of 99\n138 S. Ct. 2105, 2115 (2018).  Thus, a Notice to Appear that is incapable of triggering \nthe initiation of a removal proceeding—such as the ones provided to Plaintiffs \nKiakombua, Ana, and Emma—do not suffice to establish that these Plaintiffs are \npresently in full removal proceedings within the meaning of the INA, such that their \nclaims have become moot. \nThe cases that Defendants rely upon to support their mootness assertion with \nrespect to these Plaintiffs are non-binding precedents from other jurisdictions and are \nalso wholly inapposite.  In Pierre-Paul v. Barr, 930 F.3d 684 (5th Cir. 2019), for \nexample, the Fifth Circuit held that a noncitizen could not challenge the immigration \njudge’s jurisdiction on appeal on the grounds that a statutorily defective Notice to \nAppear had been filed with the immigration court.  Although the panel held that, under \nthe applicable regulations, a Notice to Appear that lacks time-and-place information \nmay be sufficient to vest jurisdiction in the immigration court, see id. at 689–90, that \nholding says nothing about whether, per the INA and its implementing regulations, the \nagency must provide notice of the time and place of the full removal hearing and file \nthat notice with the immigration court in order for a noncitizen to be deemed to have \nbeen placed in full removal proceedings, see 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.18(b), 1239.1.  And, \nindeed, “Congress’s decision to nest ‘service’ of an NTA under ‘[i]nitiation of removal \nproceedings’ suggests . . . that Congress intended for service” of a statutorily compliant \nNotice to Appear “to operate as the point of commencement for removal proceedings.”  \nPerez-Sanchez v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 935 F.3d 1148, 1154 (11th Cir. 2019).  And “the \nagency [is] not free to redefine the point of commencement[,]” id., because “[i]f \nCongress has defined a term, then an implementing regulation cannot re-define that \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 40 of 99\nterm in a conflicting way[,]” Ortiz-Santiago v. Barr, 924 F.3d 956, 961 (7th Cir. 2019). \nEven if one assumes that the statutorily defective Notices to Appear that were \nissued to Kiakombua, Ana, and Emma after commencement of the instant case were \nsufficient to trigger full removal proceedings for these Plaintiffs, it is not at all clear \nthat the legal claims concerning the Lesson Plan have been mooted as a result.  See O.A. \nv. Trump, 404 F. Supp. 3d 109, 139–40 (D.D.C. 2019) (holding that the issuance of a \nNotice to Appear after a complaint has been filed does not moot a plaintiff’s section \n1252(e)(3) challenge).  If there is any possibility that the prior adverse credible fear \ndetermination could be used to thwart Plaintiffs’ efforts to obtain full consideration of \ntheir asylum applications, then their claims are not moot, and, here, the credible fear \nfindings appear to remain a part of each Plaintiff’s record.  (See Ex. 8 to Admin. \nRecord, ECF No. 61-8, at 19–20 (explaining that USCIS maintains “A-files of detained \naliens[,]” which include the asylum officer’s “Interview Notes—non-Q&A and Q&A \nformat, both handwritten and typed[,]” “Comments . . . regarding negative credible fear \ndetermination[,]” and a “Memo of Adverse Information, if any.”); Ex. 11 to Admin. \nRecord, ECF No. 61-10, at 3 (showing that, as part of USCIS’s “Record of \nDetermination/Credible Fear Worksheet” (Form I-870), asylum officers inform \nnoncitizens that “[t]he statements [they] make today [at the credible fear interview] may \nbe used in deciding [their] claim and in any future immigration proceedings”).)  The \nCourt also agrees with Plaintiffs’ argument that, by focusing exclusively on the \npurported limitations on USCIS’s ability to switch these Plaintiffs’ statuses unilaterally \nat this point in the process (without making any similar representations concerning the \npower of any other defendant-agency to do so (see Defs.’ Mootness Notice at 3; Defs.’ \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 41 of 99\nReply at 14)), “Defendants have failed to carry their burden of proving that there is no \npossibility that the women could be returned to expedited removal” (Pls.’ Reply at 16).  \nCf. United States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 633 (1953) (holding that such a \ndisclaimer “does not suffice to make a case moot although it is one of the factors to be \nconsidered”).   \nFurthermore, to be clear: it is not Plaintiffs’ responsibility to establish a non-\nspeculative possibility of their being returned to expedited removal status, as \nDefendants suggest.  (See Defs.’ Mootness Notice at 3.)  Rather, “a court may not \nconclude that a defendant’s voluntary cessation of disputed conduct renders a case moot \nunless the party urging mootness demonstrates[,]” among other things, that it is \n“absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected \nto recur.”  Zukerman v. U.S.P.S., 961 F.3d 431, 442–46 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (emphasis \nadded) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also Hardaway v. D.C. \nHous. Auth., 843 F.3d 973, 980 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (rejecting the “tactic” of “attempting \nto foist [the] burden onto” plaintiffs to establish that a case is not moot).  And not only \nhave Defendants failed to make such showing under the instant circumstances, but \nPlaintiffs’ counsel avers that there have, in fact, been instances where “DHS has taken \nindividuals in § 1229a proceedings and put them in expedited removal[.]”  (Pls.’ Resp. \nto Defs.’ Mootness Notice at 3.)  Therefore, this Court concludes that Defendants have \nfailed to show that the claims Kiakombua, Ana, and Emma have brought are now moot.  \nDefendants’ argument that Sofia’s and Julia’s removals from the United States \nhave mooted their legal claims is even less persuasive.  The D.C. Circuit permits the \ncontinuation of similar challenges by noncitizens whom the government has already \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 42 of 99\nremoved.  See, e.g., Am. Immigr. Laws. Ass’n v. Reno (“AILA II”), 199 F.3d 1352, 1363 \n(D.C. Cir. 2000) (noting that, “[w]hen an alien returned to his native country, nothing \nprevented him from bringing suit here” under section 1252(e)(3) of the INA).  \nMoreover, this Court has little doubt that it could grant Sofia and Julia effective relief \nnotwithstanding the fact that they have been returned to their home countries; for \ninstance, the Court could order “the government to return to the United States the \nplaintiffs who were unlawfully deported and to provide them with new credible fear \ndeterminations consistent with the immigration laws.”  Grace I, 344 F. Supp. 3d at 105, \naff’d in relevant part, Grace II, 965 F.3d at 909.  It is also clear that the Court’s alleged \nlack of authority to issue the requested relief does not render a legal claim moot.  The \nscope of relief “goes to the meaning of the [applicable statute] and the legal availability \nof a certain kind of relief[,]” and it “confuses mootness with the merits” to argue that \nthe case no longer presents a live controversy because the court does not have the \nauthority to grant the requested relief.  Chafin, 568 U.S. at 174.   \nFinally, this Court notes that moving a noncitizen from expedited removal to full \nremoval proceedings does not necessarily portend dismissal (on mootness grounds) of a \nnoncitizen’s challenge to expedited removal procedures.  In the immigration context, \ncourts have consistently recognized the compelling concern that an agency whose \nremoval practices are challenged in court can effectively insulate itself from judicial \nreview by acting quickly to issue Notices to Appear or to expedite removal, and then \narguing that the court thereby lacks jurisdiction over those plaintiffs’ legal claims.  See \nO.A., 404 F. Supp. 3d at 140 (rejecting the argument that the court “would lose \njurisdiction under § 1252(e)(3) if the government moves the plaintiff from expedited to \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 43 of 99\nfull removal proceedings—up to the moment the Court enters final judgment”—because \n“[t]hat reading of the statute would attribute to Congress an intent to empower the \ngovernment to avoid an unfavorable decision at any time,” and “[c]onsidered against \nthe backdrop of the usual rule, which fixes statutory jurisdiction at the time the \ncomplaint is filed, that contention is a step too far”).  In any event, at a minimum, this \nconcern raises the specter of a standard exception to mootness: the “capable of \nrepetition yet evading review” doctrine.  Del Monte Fresh Produce Co. v. United States, \n570 F.3d 316, 322 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  \nAs Plaintiffs note (see Pls.’ Resp. to Defs.’ Mootness Notice at 7 n.6), Defendants \nissued Notices to Appear to Kiakombua first, and then to Ana and Emma, within days \nof learning about this lawsuit, presumably in an effort to moot their claims, which is \nprecisely what the “capable of repetition yet evading review” exception seeks to avoid.  \nSee Del Monte, 570 F.3d at 322 (holding that a plaintiff may avoid dismissal by \ndemonstrating that “(1) the challenged action is in its duration too short to be fully \nlitigated prior to its cessation or expiration, and (2) there is a reasonable expectation \nthat the same complaining party would be subjected to the same action again” (internal \nquotation marks, citation, and alteration omitted)). \nB.  This Court Has Subject-Matter Jurisdiction To Review Agency Action \nThat Allegedly Violates Provisions Of The INA \nThe final threshold disagreement between the parties in this case centers around \nthe scope and meaning of section 1252 of Title 8 of the United States Code, and the \nextent to which that statutory provision preserves, or eliminates, this Court’s subject-\nmatter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims concerning the Lesson Plan.  Plaintiffs \nmaintain that “[t]he Lesson Plan is reviewable under the plain text of 8 U.S.C. \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 44 of 99\n§ 1252(e)(3)[,]” which “expressly authorize[s] judicial review of ‘Challenges on the \nvalidity of the [expedited removal] system’” and, in particular, challenges to written \nregulations, policy directives, or guidelines that “implement” the expedited removal \nstatute (Pls.’ Mot. at 23); according to Plaintiffs, this grant of authority plainly \nencompasses “[judicial] review of a written policy and procedure (the Lesson Plan) \nissued by the Secretary of Homeland Security (through its component USCIS) to \nimplement” the asylum aspect of the expedited removal scheme (id. at 23–24).  \nDefendants respond that, while the Court might otherwise have had subject-matter \njurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1331, “the INA precludes the  \nCourt from exercising jurisdiction over this case” precisely because Plaintiffs’ claims \nconcern the agency’s practices with respect to screening individuals for expedited \nremoval.  (Defs.’ Mot. at 30.)  In this regard, Defendants point to the fact that the INA \n(specifically, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(A)) “bars district-court jurisdiction in cases \ninvolving orders of expedited removal, other than as permitted by section 1252(e)”—a \nsubdivision that Defendants read as authorizing “review only of regulations and written \npolicies that establish the structure and procedures for the expedited removal system.”  \n(Id. (emphasis added)).  In other words, in Defendants’ view, section 1252(e) is the \nonly potential basis for the exercise of this Court’s subject-matter jurisdiction over \nPlaintiffs’ claims in light of section 1252(a)(2)(A), and the Court lacks jurisdiction \nunder section 1252(e)(3) because the Lesson Plan “does not ‘implement’ the expedited \nremoval statute[.]”  (Id. at 30–31.)  Defendants further maintain that the Lesson Plan \ndoes not satisfy section 1252(e) because it “is not a . . . regulation, policy directive, \npolicy guideline, or procedure” and “Plaintiffs’ credible fear findings are not \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 45 of 99\nreviewable expedited-removal ‘determinations’” (id.), and, regardless, Plaintiffs have \nbrought these claims more than 60 days after the alleged implementation of the \nchallenged instructions (see Defs.’ Reply at 17).    \nDefendants are correct to observe, at the outset, that section 1252 plainly \nexpresses Congress’s intention to strip federal courts of jurisdiction over the expedited \nremoval process “except as provided in subsection (e)[.]”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(A) \n(emphasis added).  As relevant here, subsection (e) of section 1252 states: \n(e)  Judicial review of orders under section 1225(b)(1) \n. . . \n(3)  Challenges on validity of the system \n(A)  In general \nJudicial review of determinations under section 1225(b) of this \ntitle and its implementation is available in an action instituted \nin the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, \nbut shall be limited to determinations of— \n(i)  whether such section, or any regulation issued to \nimplement such section, is constitutional; or \n(ii)  whether such a regulation, or a written policy directive, \nwritten policy guideline, or written procedure issued by or \nunder the authority of the Attorney General to implement \nsuch section, is not consistent with applicable provisions of \nthis subchapter or is otherwise in violation of law. \n(B)  Deadlines for bringing actions \nAny action instituted under this paragraph must be filed no \nlater than 60 days after the date the challenged section, \nregulation, directive, guideline, or procedure described in \nclause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (A) is first implemented. \nId. § 1252(e)(3)(A)–(B).  However, as explained below, Defendants’ contentions about \nthe effect of section 1252(e) with respect to the scope of this Court’s subject-matter \njurisdiction miss the mark, and this is especially so in light of intervening D.C. Circuit \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 46 of 99\ncase law that illuminates the contours of section 1252(e)(3).  In sum, this Court \nmaintains its view that 28 U.S.C. § 1331 provides subject-matter jurisdiction over \nPlaintiffs’ claims, see Make the Rd. N.Y. v. McAleenan (“MTRNY I”), 405 F. Supp. 3d \n1, 26–27 (D.D.C. 2019), aff’d in relevant part, MTRNY II, 962 F.3d at 624–25, and that \nsection 1252 of Title 8 does not strip federal courts of jurisdiction where, as here, the \nclaims at issue concern a written policy directive, guideline, or procedure that \nimplements the statutory expedited removal process, and are brought no later than 60 \ndays after the agency promulgates the challenged policy or procedure.  \n1.  Section 1252(e)(3)(A) Of The INA Preserves This Court’s Subject-\nMatter Jurisdiction Under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 In These \nCircumstances \nThe scope and purpose of the judicial review that the text of section 1252(e)(3) \nexpressly preserves is addressed in the legislative history of the provision.  Senator \nOrin Hatch explained that “[i]t was very important to [the drafters] that there be judicial \nreview of the implementation of the[] provisions” of the INA concerning expedited \nremovals, because, “[a]lthough review should be expedited, the INS and the Department \nof Justice should not be insulated from review.”  142 Cong. Rec. S11,491 (daily ed. \nSept. 27, 1996) (statement of Sen. Hatch).  In this regard, the D.C. Circuit has recently \nheld (not once but twice) that, “although much of section 1252 limits and channels \njudicial relief directly into the federal appellate courts or habeas corpus proceedings, \nsubsection (e)(3) expressly provides in the expedited removal context for more \ntraditional judicial review of challenges on validity of the system, including agency \npolicies governing credible-fear interviews.”  Grace II, 965 F.3d at 891 (internal \nquotation marks, citations, and alterations omitted); see also MTRNY II, 962 F.3d at \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 47 of 99\n625.  Thus, whether section 1252(e)(3) is interpreted as a jurisdiction-granting \nprovision, see id. at 630, or as a provision that preserves the pre-existing jurisdiction of \nthe Court in the context of the INA’s other jurisdiction-stripping provisions, see id. at \n624–25, it is clear that, per the language of section 1252(e)(3), this Court has \njurisdiction to review the kinds of agency actions and legal challenges that that \nparticular subdivision addresses, see id. at 624–30. \nOf course, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs’ challenges to the Lesson Plan do \nnot fit within section 1252(e)(3)(A)’s prescribed judicial-review authorization, because \nthe Lesson Plan is not a “written policy directive, written policy guideline, or written \nprocedure” that “implement[s]” the expedited removal system that section 1225(b) \nestablishes.  (See Defs.’ Mot. at 30–36.)  This argument has little force, however, both \nbecause of the plain language of section 1252(e)(3) and also due to the D.C. Circuit’s \nreasoning in a recent binding opinion in Grace v. Barr, 965 F.3d 883 (D.C. Cir. 2020).   \nGrace involved a challenge to “a host of executive-branch policies adopted to \nimplement the expedited-removal provisions” of the INA, including a ruling by the \nAttorney General and a guidance document that USCIS issued concerning that \nadjudication.  Grace II, 965 F.3d at 887, 889–90 (addressing Matter of A-B-, 27 I. & N. \nDec. 316, 321 (A.G. 2018), wherein the Attorney General had laid out new policies \nconcerning asylum claims based on persecution by non-state actors on account of an \napplicant’s membership in a particular social group).  With respect to the Attorney \nGeneral’s ruling, the D.C. Circuit held that A-B- qualified as an “implementation” of \nsection 1225(b) within the meaning of section 1252(e)(3), because A-B- “expressly \nreferences the credible-fear standard and asylum officers’ role in implementing the \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 48 of 99\nexpedited-removal system[,]” and its “overarching purpose, moreover, is to interpret \nsection 1158’s phrase ‘membership in a particular social group,’ which Congress \nincorporated into section 1225(b)[.]”  Id. at 895.  The D.C. Circuit panel also concluded \nthat A-B- qualified as a “written policy directive” or “written policy guideline” under \nsection 1252(e)(3), because “agencies can and do announce new policies in \nadjudications[,]” especially in the immigration context, and if “the Attorney General \ncould immunize credible-fear policies from judicial review by simply announcing them \nin section 1229a adjudications[,]” that “result would conflict with section 1252(e)(3)’s \npurpose” and text.  Id.  The D.C. Circuit further held that the related USCIS guidance \ndocument was a “written policy directive” or “guideline” that implements section \n1225(b), because the document cited to section 1225(b), “describe[d] itself as a ‘policy \nmemorandum’ that ‘provides guidance’ to USCIS officers[,]” and “instruct[ed] ‘all \nUSCIS employees’ on how to apply A-B- ‘consistent[ly]’ throughout several types of \nproceedings, including ‘credible fear . . . adjudications.’”  Id. at 892 (internal citations \nand emphasis omitted).   \nDrawing from the D.C. Circuit’s analysis in Grace II, it is clear to this Court that \nthe Lesson Plan also qualifies as a “written policy directive, written policy guideline, or \nwritten procedure” that implements the expedited removal scheme and thus can be \nchallenged in federal court under section 1252(e)(3).  8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(A)(ii).  To \nbegin with, the plain meaning of the statutory terms “directive” and “guideline” sweeps \nbroadly.  See, e.g., Directive, Merriam-Webster Unabridged Dictionary (online ed. \n2020) (defining “directive” as, inter alia, “something that serves to direct, guide, and \nusually impel toward an action, attainment, or goal”); Guideline, Merriam-Webster \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 49 of 99\nUnabridged Dictionary (online ed. 2020) (explaining that “guideline” is, with respect to \na government action, “an indication or outline of future policy or conduct”); cf. Syncor \nInt’l Corp. v. Shalala, 127 F.3d 90, 93 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (defining the term “guidance” \nin the APA context as “a general statement of policy”).  Consistent with the breadth of \nthis plain language, courts in this circuit have generally suggested that the primary \nstatutory limitation on the types of policies concerning an agency’s expedited removal \npractices that can be challenged pursuant to that section is not the type of document that \nannounces the policy, but the fact that any such policy must be written down.  See, e.g., \nAm. Immigr. Laws. Ass’n v. Reno (“AILA I”), 18 F. Supp. 2d 38, 58 (D.D.C. 1998) \n(holding that “unwritten” policies are unreviewable), aff’d, AILA II, 199 F.3d 1352.  In \naddition, Grace II tangentially involved DHS policies that had been included in a prior \nversion of the Lesson Plan at issue here, and the Circuit expressly indicated a lack of \nactual (or serious) dispute concerning whether that version of the Lesson Plan \n“reflect[s] USCIS’s consistent practice”—and thus qualifies as a policy or procedure—\nespecially given that, in Grace II, USCIS “nowhere claim[ed] that immigration officials \nwere free to depart” from the Lesson Plan.  Grace II, 965 F.3d at 902 (internal \nquotation marks and citations omitted).   \nHere, government counsel struggles valiantly to suggest that USCIS asylum \nofficers do have such freedom: he points out that the Lesson Plan “do[es] not carry the \nforce of law” (Defs.’ Mot. at 22), and argues that it “does not ordain or enact any \npolicy” (Defs.’ Reply at 15), but is merely an “interpretive material” that “just states \nthe law, as pronounced by statutes, regulations, and case law” (Defs.’ Mot. at 32–33).  \nThose assertions (which contradict the position that the government took in Grace II) \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 50 of 99\nare difficult to square with internal DHS memoranda that plainly indicate that the \nagency itself understands the Lesson Plan to be binding on asylum officers.  (See, e.g., \nEx. 28 to Admin. Record, ECF No. 61-25, at 3; Ex. 3 to Admin. Record, ECF No. 61-3, \nat 3.)  Defendants fail to point to a single piece of evidence that supports their current \ncontention that the Lesson Plan is not binding on the officers that are required to apply \nits prescriptions when they make credible fear determinations—and, to the contrary, all \nof the evidence in front of this Court—including DHS internal memoranda—suggests \notherwise.  See CropLife Am. v. E.P.A., 329 F.3d 876, 883 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (“[T]he \nagency’s characterization of its own action is not controlling if it self-servingly \ndisclaims any intention to create a rule with the ‘force of law,’ but the record indicates \notherwise.”).  And to the extent that the Lesson Plan’s provisions are binding on asylum \nofficers, they are not reasonably characterized as something other than a written policy \ndirective, guidance, or procedure, as Defendants now maintain.  \nNor does it matter that the Lesson Plan is part of the “Asylum Division Officer \nTraining Course,” and that training materials are not explicitly listed as reviewable \ndocuments under section 1252(e)(3)(A)(ii).  (See Defs.’ Mot. at 32–33.)  The Lesson \nPlan itself belies Defendants’ argument, insofar as its express purpose is “to explain” to \nasylum officers how to make a credible fear determination.  (Lesson Plan at 2.)  Thus, \nthere can be no doubt that the document is intended to guide and direct asylum officers \nin making those determinations.  It is also well established that the particular label that \nan agency chooses to affix to a challenged policy is not dispositive of whether a written \npolicy document falls within the purview of section 1252(e)(3) of the INA, as the D.C. \nCircuit made clear.  See Grace II, 965 F.3d at 895–96.  Given this, and also the \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 51 of 99\nestablished fact that asylum officers are required to follow the Lesson Plan’s guidance \nin this regard, the Lesson Plan unquestionably counts as a written policy directive, \npolicy guideline, or procedure within the meaning of section 1252(e)(3) of the INA. \nThe Court is also compelled to conclude that the Lesson Plan “implements” the \nexpedited removal statute for the purpose of section 1252(e)(3)(A).  Consistent with the \nD.C. Circuit’s holding in Grace II, an agency’s written recitation of its understanding \nof the substantive and procedural standards of asylum law that pertain to credible fear \ndeterminations is an implementation of the various procedures that section 1225(b) \nrequires.  See Grace II, 965 F.3d at 892.  The Lesson Plan is doing exactly that, insofar \nas it is specifically designed to help the asylum officers whom section 1225(b) charges \nwith making credible fear determinations to fulfill that responsibility.  Defendants’ \nresponsive contention that the Lesson Plan does not qualify as an implementation of the \nexpedited removal scheme because an “‘implementation’ involves intentional action to \naccomplish a specific obligation, not a collateral consequence of actions taken to \naccomplish a different goal” (Defs.’ Mot. at 31 (emphasis added and citation \nomitted))—an argument that was not raised in Grace II—is mistaken, because neither \nthe ordinary meaning of the word “implementation” nor the text of section \n1252(e)(3)(A) includes such a specific intent requirement.  See Bryan A. Garner, A \nDictionary of Modern Legal Usage 422 (2d ed. 2001) (explaining that the verb “to \nimplement” ordinarily means “to carry out”); Implement, Merriam-Webster Unabridged \nDictionary (online ed. 2020) (defining “implement” as, inter alia, to “give practical \neffect to and ensure of actual fulfillment by concrete measures”); see also Grace II, 965 \nF.3d at 892 (determining whether an agency action was an “implementation” of section \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 52 of 99\n1225(b) without considering whether it was the agency’s intent to implement that \nprovision).   \nIn any event, even if Defendants are right that intentionality is required for \nimplementation under section 1252(e)(3), there is no question that, by issuing the \nLesson Plan, the agency intends to facilitate the first stage of the asylum review process \nthat section 1225(b) establishes: the very first page of the training manual announces \nthat the agency’s “purpose” in providing this Lesson Plan regarding credible fear \ndeterminations is “to explain how to determine whether an alien subject to expedited \nremoval . . . has a credible fear of persecution or torture” (Lesson Plan at 2), which is a \ntask that an asylum officer has the indisputable duty to perform pursuant to the \nexpedited removal scheme established in 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b).  Moreover, and perhaps \neven more significantly, in the course of articulating what Plaintiffs maintain are new \nand unlawful principles for evaluating credible fear, the Lesson Plan repeatedly and \nspecifically cites section 1225(b) and explicitly references the statutory standard for \ncredible fear determinations.  (See, e.g., Lesson Plan at 6, 9, 12, 14, 19.)  Cf. Grace II, \n965 F.3d at 892 (relying on similar statements of purpose and citations to determine \nwhether a particular agency action “implements” section 1225(b)).  Thus, USCIS \nplainly intended the Lesson Plan to be used by its agents to carry out the task of making \ncredible fear assessments pursuant to section 1225(b), and as a result, this Court \nconcludes that the Lesson Plan is properly construed as a written policy directive, \nguideline, or procedure that implements the provisions of the expedited removal statute \nfor the purpose of section 1252(e)(3). \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 53 of 99\n2.  Plaintiffs’ Claims Are Not Time-Barred \nIn their reply brief, Defendants pivot to yet another potential basis for asserting \nthat section 1252(e)(3)’s judicial review requirements are not satisfied under the \ncircumstances presented here; they contend that “Congress has imposed a jurisdictional \nrequirement that these challenges be filed ‘no later than 60 days after the date the \nchallenged section, regulation, directive, guideline, or procedure . . . is first \nimplemented[,]’” but “most of the 2019 Lesson Plan has been operative for years, to say \nnothing of the underlying statutes, regulations, external policies, and other materials \ncited in the Lesson Plan, much of which has also been operative for years.”  (Defs.’ \nReply at 17 (emphasis in the original).)12  Assuming arguendo that the 60-day \nrequirement of section 1252(e)(3)(B) is jurisdictional in nature—which is not at all \nclear, given that section 1252(e)(3) does not speak in jurisdictional terms, see MTRNY I, \n405 F. Supp. 3d at 26, rev’d on other grounds, MTRNY II, 962 F.3d 612; see also \nUnited States v. Kwai Fun Wong, 575 U.S. 402, 410 (2015) (observing that “most time \nbars are nonjurisdictional”); Gonzalez v. Thaler, 565 U.S. 134, 141 (2012) (suggesting \nthat courts should “press[] a stricter distinction between truly jurisdictional rules . . . \nand nonjurisdictional claim-processing rules” (internal quotation marks omitted)); but \nsee Vijender v. Wolf, No. 19-cv-3337, 2020 WL 1935556, at *2–6 (D.D.C. Apr. 22, \n \n12 Defendants reference the 60-day requirement in their opening brief, but do not assert that the time bar \nforecloses Plaintiffs’ claims in that context.  (See Defs.’ Mot. at 33–34.)  Rather, Defendants mention \nthat part of section 1252(e)(3) initially simply and solely to support their argument about the intended \nmeaning of the statutory term “implementation.”  (See id. at 33 (asserting that “[t]he operation of the \nstatute of limitations under section 1252(e)(3) makes it all the more apparent that Congress did not \nintend that an interpretation of the asylum or CAT standard in administrative training materials \nconstitutes a new implementation of section 1225(b)(1)”).) The first invocation of the 60-day timeframe \nas a potential independent bar to the Court’s consideration of the merits of Plaintiffs’ claims appears in \nDefendants’ reply brief.  (See Defs.’ Reply at 18–19.)  \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 54 of 99\n2020) (concluding that the 60-day bar is jurisdictional)—Defendants’ insistence that \nPlaintiffs’ claims concerning the Lesson Plan have been brought outside of the \nprescribed 60-day window are far off base. \nFirst of all, per the plain text of section 1252(e)(3), a legal claim concerning a \nwritten policy directive, guidance, or procedure that implements the expedited removal \nsystem is timely if the “action” is brought “no later than 60 days after the date the \nchallenged section, regulation, directive, guideline, or procedure . . . is first \nimplemented.”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(B) (emphasis added).  Defendants have yet to \nexplain how language that appeared in the Lesson Plan for the first time in April of \n2019 could possibly have been challenged previously.  And, indeed, it is clear from \nboth the text and operation of section 1252(e)(3)(B) that, by enacting that provision, \nCongress merely intended to limit the timing of court challenges to within 60 days of \nwhen any particular policy prescription “first” issues.     \nPlaintiffs’ legal action unquestionably fits within that timeframe.  The original \ncomplaint in this case was filed on June 25, 2019 (see Compl., ECF No. 1, at 21)—\nwithin 60 days of April 30, 2019, which is the date that is listed on the first page of the \nrelevant version of the Lesson Plan (see Lesson Plan at 2).  Defendants concede that \n“this challenge was brought within 60 days of the April 30th Lesson Plan being sent \nout” (Hr’g Tr., ECF No. 65, at 41:4–5), and the D.C. Circuit has held that the 60-day \nperiod in section 1252(e)(3)(B) begins to run on the “effective date” of the relevant \nregulation or written policy, AILA II, 199 F.3d at 1355 (holding that, because the \nchallenged regulation was “effective April 1, 1997,” a challenge to that regulation “had \nto be filed no later than sixty days after April 1”).  Thus, the claims in Plaintiffs’ \n51 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 55 of 99\ncomplaint, which concern an amended Lesson Plan that the agency first sent out less \nthan 60 days prior to the filing of this lawsuit, are timely.   \nThere is really no basis in law or logic for Defendants to suggest otherwise.  \nNevertheless, Defendants argue that section 1252(e)(3)(B) requires the Court to \ndetermine which of the amended “parts of a reviewable agency document are [actually] \nnew” (Defs.’ Reply at 18), as distinguished from those amended sections that are \nsubstantially similar to the prior iteration because, for example, only “some language on \nthe margins” has changed (Hr’g Tr. at 41:23–25).  To support this contention, defense \ncounsel emphasizes that the agency has “discretion to reword” its guidance documents, \nand argues that it should be able to do so without restarting the 60-day clock.  (Id. at \n42:7.)  In the agency’s view, then, the Court must “figure out [what] degree of \ndeviance” there is between the prior version of a written policy provision and the \nchallenged amendment in order to determine whether such changes are sufficiently \nsubstantive to restart the statutory clock.  (Id. at 43:14–15.)   \nNothing in the statute requires this result.  In particular, section 1252(e)(3) \nplainly authorizes judicial review of written policies, guidelines, or procedures that \nimplement the expedited removal statute, without regard to whether such policies \ndeviate substantively from an agency’s prior practices.  Thus, consistent with binding \nprecedent, the “first” implementation language in section 1252(e)(3)(B) need not, and \nshould not, be read that broadly.  Cf. MTRNY II, 962 F.3d at 623–24 (explaining that the \nstrong “presumption favoring judicial review of administrative action” applies “even \nwhere, as here, the statute expressly prohibits judicial review—in other words, the \npresumption dictates that such provisions must be read narrowly” (internal quotation \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 56 of 99\nmarks and citation omitted)).  Accordingly, all that is necessary for timeliness under \nsection 1252(e)(3)(B) is what indisputably happened here: that the lawsuit Plaintiffs \nhave filed to challenge aspects of an agency’s written policy directive concerning \nimplementation of the expedited removal scheme is brought within 60 days of when the \nagency issues the document that contains the challenged prescriptions.   \nC.  The Lesson Plan Violates The INA And Its Implementing Regulations  \nHaving determined that Plaintiffs have Article III standing to bring the claims in \nthis lawsuit, that Plaintiffs’ claims are not moot, and that the Court has subject-matter \njurisdiction to consider Plaintiffs’ legal challenge (see supra Sections IV.A–B), the \nCourt now turns to the merits of the complaint’s contention that the Lesson Plan is \nunlawful.  As a reminder, Plaintiffs have cited alternative and independent grounds for \nthis proposition, beginning with the contention that certain provisions of the Lesson \nPlan are “not consistent with the governing [immigration] statutes and regulations” \npursuant to section 1252(e)(3).  (Pls.’ Mot. at 39; see also Am. Compl. ¶ 90.)13   \nTo substantiate this particular claim, Plaintiffs’ complaint sets out various \nexamples of ways in which the Lesson Plan allegedly transgresses the INA and its \n \n13 The parties here appear to agree that section 1252(e)(3) creates a cause of action to review the Lesson \nPlan’s consistency with the INA (as amended) and its implementing regulations.  (See Defs.’ Mot. at 55 \n(noting that section 1252(e)(3) is “the only available cause of action” for Plaintiffs’ claims); see also \nPls.’ Mot. at 39.)  This Court has previously doubted whether section 1252(e)(3)’s reference to judicial \nreview of claims that agency’s written policies are “otherwise in violation of law” means that \n“Congress sought to permit plaintiffs to police DHS’s compliance with the universe of potentially \napplicable legal requirements under circumstances in which there would have otherwise been no relief \nwith respect to that violation[.]”  MTRNY I, 405 F. Supp. 3d at 38.  But, regardless, section 1252(e)(3) \ncontains an express cause of action for the claim that the agency’s policy prescriptions are “not \nconsistent with [the] applicable provisions of” the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(ii), and that cause of \naction (which also “exists, presumptively, with respect to every statute that confers guided discretion \nupon agency actors”) “necessarily relates to the substantive standards that the INA itself prescribes.”  \nMTRNY I, 405 F. Supp. 3d at 38 n.20 (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(ii)).   \n53 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 57 of 99\nimplementing regulations.  (See, e.g., Am. Compl. ¶ 85(c) (asserting that the Lesson \nPlan “directs asylum officers to make negative credible fear determinations based on \nwhat are actually discretionary factors, not eligibility criteria” (emphasis omitted)); id. \n¶ 83 (arguing that the Lesson Plan “increases the evidentiary burden the asylum seeker \nmust carry to pass a credible fear screening”); see also Pls.’ Mot. at 39–50 (expounding \nfurther upon the alleged conflict between the credible fear standards in the Lesson Plan \nand those established by the INA and its related regulations).)  For their part, \nDefendants argue that there is no inconsistency between the provisions of the Lesson \nPlan and the relevant substantive statutes and regulations.  (See generally Defs.’ Mot. at \n48–54; Defs.’ Reply at 32–40.)   \nAs explained below, this Court finds that Plaintiffs have the better of this \nargument.  In reaching that conclusion, the Court has applied the well-worn deference \nframework that governs a federal court’s determination of whether or not an agency has \nfaithfully interpreted the law in relation to its own pronouncements.  See Grace II, 965 \nF.3d at 896 (noting that it is “well settled” that traditional principles of agency \ndeference “are applicable to the Attorney General’s interpretation of the INA” and its \nimplementing regulations (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).  Thus, to the \nextent Plaintiffs are challenging Defendants’ interpretation of the INA, the Court asks \n“whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue[,]” because \ncourts “must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.”  Chevron, \nU.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842–43 (1984).  But “if the \nstatute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the \ncourt [becomes] whether the agency’s answer is based on a permissible construction of \n54 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 58 of 99\nthe statute.”  Id. at 843.  And where Plaintiffs seek to challenge Defendants’ \ninterpretation of regulations that implement the INA, the Court asks whether the \nregulation is “genuinely” or “truly” ambiguous, “even after a court has resorted to all \nthe standard tools of interpretation.”  Kisor v. Wilkie, 139 S. Ct. 2400, 2414 (2019).  If \nit is, then the relevant question becomes whether Defendants’ interpretation is \n“reasonable” or “within the zone of ambiguity the court has identified after employing \nall its interpretive tools.”  Id. at 2415–16.   \nWhen this Court applies these standards to evaluate the bulk of the provisions of \nthe Lesson Plan that Plaintiffs point to as examples of the unlawful nature of this \nguidance, the Court concludes that USCIS has unlawfully required screening officers to \nmake credible fear determinations in a manner that is manifestly inconsistent with the \ntwo-stage asylum eligibility framework that the INA plainly establishes.  In addition, \nthe Court finds that certain Lesson Plan provisions speak to aspects of the credible fear \nprocess that neither Congress nor DHS has expressly addressed, but in so doing USCIS \nimproperly relies on unreasonable interpretations of the established statutory scheme.  \nTherefore, the Court concludes that various aspects of the Lesson Plan cannot be \nsquared with the INA’s mandates.     \n1.  The INA And Its Regulations Plainly Establish A Two-Stage \nFramework To Demonstrate Asylum Eligibility In The Expedited \nRemoval Context, And Provide Standards For Making The \nRequired Assessment At Each Stage Of The Process \nTo start, it bears repeating that, under the INA, DHS may designate certain \nnoncitizens for expedited removal, see 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I)–(II), and the \nprocess for determining whether those individuals will be granted asylum, or will be \nremoved from the United States swiftly, has two stages: (1) an initial screening to \n55 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 59 of 99\ndetermine whether or not the noncitizen has a credible fear of persecution or torture in \ntheir home country (if she does not, she is slated for expedited removal without an \nadditional hearing), and (2) full removal proceedings, during which the noncitizen bears \nthe burden of establishing her eligibility for asylum.   \nMoreover, and importantly, the legal standard for whether or not a noncitizen \nclears the first hurdle in this two-stage process—i.e., whether she is entitled to a \npositive credible fear determination or an adverse one—is specifically addressed in the \nINA.  Section 1225(b) defines “credible fear of persecution” as follows: \nFor purposes of this subparagraph, the term “credible fear of \npersecution” means that there is a significant possibility, taking \ninto account the credibility of the statements made by the alien \nin support of the alien’s claim and such other facts as are known \nto the officer, that the alien could establish eligibility for \nasylum under section 1158 of this title. \nId. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v).  As relevant here, a noncitizen is eligible for asylum under \nsection 1158 if she demonstrates that she “is a refugee[,]” id. § 1158(b)(1)(A)—a term \nthat the statute defines as a noncitizen “who is unable or unwilling to return to . . . [her] \ncountry because of [past] persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account \nof race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political \nopinion,” id. § 1101(a)(42)(A).14   \n \n14 A “credible fear of torture” is defined by regulation, not statute, and has a meaning that is notably \ndifferent from the statutory standard that defines a credible fear of persecution.  For example, instead \nof turning on the “possibility” that the noncitizen “could establish” eligibility in the future, 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(B)(v), the regulations that govern credible fear of torture state that “an alien will be found \nto have a credible fear of torture if the alien shows that there is a significant possibility that he or she is \neligible for withholding of removal or deferral of removal[,]” 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(e)(3) (emphasis \nadded).  Because the complaint most clearly alleges that provisions of the Lesson Plan concerning the \ndetermination of a credible fear of persecution conflict with the INA, the Court has only considered \nPlaintiffs’ claims concerning the Lesson Plan’s consistency with the credible fear of persecution \n56 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 60 of 99\n  The INA also specifically addresses the manner in which government officers \nundertake to assess whether a noncitizen has a credible fear of persecution.  A trained \n“asylum officer” interviews the noncitizen, id. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(i), and determines \nwhether she has a credible fear of persecution, “taking into account the credibility of \nthe statements” of the applicant in support of her claim and “such other facts as are \nknown to the officer,” id. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v).  The applicable regulations clarify that \n“[t]he purpose of the interview shall be to elicit all relevant and useful information \nbearing on whether the applicant has a credible fear of persecution[,]” and that the \ninterview is to be conducted “in a nonadversarial manner[.]”  8 C.F.R. § 208.30(d). \nDuring this credible fear interview, the noncitizen “may present other evidence” \nconcerning “whether the applicant has a credible fear of persecution or torture[,]” id. \n§ 208.30(d)(4); however, such additional proof is only provided “if available[,]” and is \nnot required, id.  Accordingly, courts have long held that “the credible fear interview \ndoes not require the level of detail expected of the petitioner for an asylum claim[,]” \nYang v. Ashcroft, 99 F. App’x 124, 125 (9th Cir. 2004), especially since these “often \nrushed” assessments can occur under “tense conditions,” Lin Ming Feng v. Sessions, \n721 F. App’x 53, 55 (2d Cir. 2018).  As a practical matter, a noncitizen “appearing at a \ncredible fear interview has ordinarily been detained since his or her arrival in the \nUnited States and is therefore likely to be more unprepared, more vulnerable, and more \nwary of government officials than an asylum applicant who appears for an interview \nbefore immigration authorities well after arrival.”  Zhang v. Holder, 585 F.3d 715, 724 \n \nprocess laid out in the INA and its implementing regulations. \n57 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 61 of 99\n(2d Cir. 2009).  Moreover, the interviewee “is not represented by counsel, and may be \ncompletely unfamiliar with United States immigration laws and the elements necessary \nto demonstrate eligibility for asylum.”  Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, 357 F.3d 169, 179 \n(2d Cir. 2004) (Sotomayor, J.).  Thus, this first stage of the asylum eligibility process is \nintended to be a mere “screening interview[,]” Thuraissigiam, 140 S. Ct. at 1965, \nduring which “[t]he applicant need not show that he or she is in fact eligible for \nasylum—a ‘credible fear’ equates to only a ‘significant possibility’ that the alien would \nbe eligible.”  Id. (emphasis in original); see also Ferreira v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 803, 809 \n(7th Cir. 2016) (“[T]he credible-fear interview is not meant to be a detailed account of \nthe events supporting an applicant’s asylum claim[.]”).15   \nIt is also important to note that the noncitizens who are found to have a credible \nfear of persecution after the credible fear interview are statutorily entitled to proceed to \nthe next stage of the process: section 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii) states unequivocally that, “[i]f \nthe officer determines at the time of the interview that an alien has a credible fear of \npersecution (within the meaning of clause (v)), the alien shall be detained for further \nconsideration of the application for asylum” in the context of full removal proceedings.  \n8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii) (emphasis added); see also 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(e)(5)(i) \n(providing that a noncitizen who “is able to establish a credible fear of persecution but \n \n15 The relevant legislative history confirms that Congress intended for the credible fear threshold “to be \na low screening standard for admission into the usual full asylum process.” 142 Cong. Rec. S11,491 \n(daily ed. Sept. 27, 1996) (statement of Sen. Hatch); see also 142 Cong. Rec. H11,081 (daily ed. Sept. \n25, 1996) (statement of Rep. Hyde) (explaining that the “significant possibility” standard is lower than \nthe “more probable than not” language used in an earlier version of the bill).  Cf. Inspection and \nExpedited Removal of Aliens, 62 Fed. Reg. 10,312, 10,320 (Mar. 6, 1997) (“The credible fear standard \nsets a low threshold of proof of potential entitlement to asylum; many aliens who have passed the \ncredible fear standard will not ultimately be granted asylum.”). \n58 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 62 of 99\nappears to be subject to one or more of the mandatory bars to applying for, or being \ngranted, asylum . . . shall nonetheless” be placed in full removal proceedings).   \nWith respect to the second stage of the asylum-eligibility process, asylum \nseekers have a full hearing before an immigration judge, see 8 U.S.C. § 1229a, during \nwhich they may be represented by counsel, see id. § 1362.  The goal, in relevant part, is \nto “refer[] to specific facts sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant is a refugee[,]” \nid. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(ii), and if the judge “determines that the applicant should provide \nevidence that corroborates otherwise credible testimony, such evidence must be \nprovided unless the applicant does not have the evidence and cannot reasonably obtain \nthe evidence[,]” id.  Per the applicable regulations, “[t]he burden of proof is on the \napplicant for asylum to establish that he or she is a refugee[,]” and the noncitizen “may \nqualify as a refugee either because he or she has suffered past persecution or because he \nor she has a well-founded fear of future persecution.”  8 C.F.R. § 208.13(a)–(b).   \nFinally, the INA and its implementing regulations make clear that even those \nnoncitizens who establish that they are eligible for asylum because they qualify as \nrefugees are not entitled to asylum under U.S. law.  In other words, at the end of the \nday, asylum is discretionary relief that the federal government “may grant” to anyone \nthe agency “determines . . . is a refugee” in the context of full removal proceedings.      \n8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(A) (emphasis added).  DHS has promulgated regulations that lay \nout various discretionary criteria to guide agency officials in deciding whether to grant \nasylum to noncitizens.  In particular, a noncitizen who demonstrates that she has been \npersecuted in the past “shall also be presumed to have a well-founded fear of \npersecution on the basis of the original claim[,]” 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1), although an \n59 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 63 of 99\nasylum officer can, “in the exercise of his or her discretion,” deny the asylum \napplication of a noncitizen entitled to such a presumption by making a finding, “by a \npreponderance of the evidence[,]” that either “[t]here has been a fundamental change in \ncircumstances such that the applicant no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution” \nor “[t]he applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the \napplicant’s country of nationality[,]” id. § 208.13(b)(1)(i).  If the asylum officer makes \neither finding, the noncitizen bears the burden of establishing that she “may be granted \nasylum, in the exercise of the decision-maker’s discretion,” id. § 208.13(b)(1)(iii), for \n“humanitarian reasons[,]” Matter of Chen, 20 I. & N. Dec. 16, 19 (B.I.A. 1989), \nincluding “compelling reasons for being unwilling or unable to return to the country \narising out of the severity of the past persecution[,]” or when “there is a reasonable \npossibility that he or she may suffer other serious harm upon removal to that country[,]” \n8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)(iii).   \n2.  Certain Provisions Of The Lesson Plan Conflate The Initial \nCredible Fear Screening Standards With The Requirements For \nAsylum Eligibility, And Are Thus Manifestly Inconsistent With \nThe INA’s Express Prescriptions \na.  The Lesson Plan Requires That A Noncitizen “Identify More \nThan Significant Evidence That The Applicant Is A Refugee \nEntitled To Asylum” In Order To Pass The Credible Fear \nScreening  \nThe Lesson Plan specifically instructs USCIS asylum officers that “the credible \nfear significant possibility standard of proof . . . requires the applicant to identify more \nthan significant evidence that the applicant is a refugee entitled to asylum[.]”  (Lesson \nPlan at 13 (internal quotation marks omitted).)  This policy is in direct conflict with the \nplain text of the INA and its regulations in three related ways.   \n60 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 64 of 99\nFirst of all, the INA only requires that a credible fear interviewee have a \n“significant possibility” of establishing her eligibility for asylum, 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(B)(v), which is not the same as demanding “more than significant \nevidence that the applicant is a refugee” (Lesson Plan at 13).  These two standards \nplainly differ, for at least the simple reason that the credible fear screening interview, \nas Congress envisioned it, focuses primarily on the “statements” of the applicant during \nthe interview, not necessarily any evidence.  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v); see also 8 \nC.F.R. § 208.30(d)(4) (providing that the noncitizen “may present other evidence” only \n“if available”).  By contrast, the Lesson Plan expressly requires the asylum officer to \nevaluate the applicant’s evidence.  And the fact that the “significant evidence” language \nthat appears in the Lesson Plan “comes from the D.C. Circuit” in a completely different \ncontext (Defs.’ Reply at 34) is of no moment.  It is entirely inapposite that a D.C. \nCircuit panel once suggested that one of “the elements of a cause of action for negligent \nor reckless spoliation of evidence” under D.C. law is “a significant possibility of \nsuccess of the potential civil action if the evidence were available[,]” and that, in that \nrespect, “‘significant possibility’ . . . implies a showing higher than the already \nrecognized standard of ‘significant evidence.’”  Holmes v. Amerex Rent-A-Car, 180 \nF.3d 294, 297 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (quoting Holmes v. Amerex Rent-A-Car, 710 A.2d 846, \n852, 854 (D.C. 1998)).  Thus, Defendants cannot rely on that language or that reasoning \nto contend that the Lesson Plan’s clear shift toward mandating an evidentiary showing \nat the credible fear stage is consistent with what the INA requires.  \nSecond, and similarly, applicants have a credible fear under the INA if there is a \nsignificant possibility that they “could establish” that they are refugees during the next \n61 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 65 of 99\nstage of the process, 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v) (emphasis added), which means that \nthe Lesson Plan’s requirement that a credible fear interviewee have significant evidence \nthat she “is a refugee” unquestionably heightens the bar (Lesson Plan at 13 (emphasis \nadded)).  “Congress’ use of a verb tense is significant in construing statutes[,]” United \nStates v. Wilson, 503 U.S. 329, 333 (1992), and there is no doubt that the word “is” \nconnotes “a more certain determination” than “could[,]” Yusupov v. Att’y Gen. of U.S., \n518 F.3d 185, 201 (3d Cir. 2008) (focusing on a different provision of the INA).  \nTherefore, USCIS’s requirement of certainty, as conveyed by the use of the present \ntense “is,” is in tension with Congress’s deliberate employment of the verb phrase \n“could”—for the latter conveys that a possibility, rather than certainty, suffices at the \ncredible fear stage of the asylum-eligibility process.   \nThird, because even those noncitizens who ultimately manage to establish that \nthey qualify as refugees under the statute are thereby only rendered eligible for asylum, \nsee 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(A), it is misleading to the point of conflict for the Lesson \nPlan to require applicants to make a showing of entitlement to asylum at the credible \nfear stage—or, indeed, at any point in the asylum-eligibility process.  (See Lesson Plan \nat 13.)  And to the extent that this part of the Lesson Plan also appears to demand a \nmore substantial showing than what section 1225(b)(1)(B)(v) requires, it unlawfully \nalters the credible fear standard.  (See Pls.’ Mot. at 43–44.)   \nb.  The Lesson Plan Imports Factors That Are Relevant For \nAsylum Relief During The Full Removal Proceeding Stage \nInto The Initial Credible Fear Determination Process  \nUnder the INA, a noncitizen “who has suffered past persecution or who has a \nwell-founded fear of being persecuted in the future is eligible for asylum,” Gutierrez-\n62 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 66 of 99\nRogue v. I.N.S., 954 F.2d 769, 771 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (internal quotation marks and \ncitation omitted); yet, the ultimate “decision whether to grant asylum is within the \ndiscretion of the Attorney General[,]” id.  The INA’s regulations identify particular \ngrounds for the discretionary denial of asylum to established refugees who suffered \npersecution in the past, including “a fundamental change in circumstances such that the \napplicant no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution” or the ability to “avoid \nfuture persecution by relocating to another part of the applicant’s country of \nnationality[.]”  8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)(i).  This Court agrees with Plaintiffs that, \ninsofar as the Lesson Plan requires asylum officers to consider these kinds of \ndiscretionary factors at the credible fear stage of the asylum eligibility process, it \nplainly subverts the INA’s two-stage asylum scheme.  \nFor instance, according to the Lesson Plan, if “internal relocation is reasonable, \nthe applicant does not have a credible fear of persecution.”  (Lesson Plan at 16; see also \nid. at 20 (making “a significant possibility that the applicant cannot reasonably \ninternally relocate within his or her country” one of the required elements for a positive \ncredible fear determination).)  The Lesson Plan also specifically instructs USCIS \nasylum officers that the following findings, taken together, “are sufficient to satisfy the \ncredible fear standard”: “(1) there is a significant possibility . . . that the applicant \nexperienced past persecution on account of a protected characteristic, (2) the conditions \nthat gave rise to such persecution continue to exist in the applicant’s home country, and \n(3) the applicant could not avoid such persecution by relocating within his or her home \ncountry[.]”  (Id. at 19; see also id. at 36 (same).)  And the Lesson Plan further indicates \n63 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 67 of 99\nthat, “if the evidence does not establish . . . reasons why internal relocation is not \npossible, a negative credible fear determination is appropriate.”  (Id. at 19.)   \nThese required findings, and the consequences of establishing them as set forth \nin the Lesson Plan, bear no relationship to the assessments that Congress has prescribed \nwhen credible fear determinations are made pursuant to the INA.  Again, all that the \nstatute requires for a determination that the noncitizen has a credible fear of persecution \nis a significant possibility that the asylum seeker could establish eligibility for asylum, \nsee 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v), and once this statutory standard is satisfied, the \napplicant must be deemed to have a credible fear of persecution.  The statute says \nnothing about country conditions or the ability of the person to relocate.  And the fact \nthat the regulations list such factors as potential bases for the eventual denial of asylum \nin the discretion of the agency after a full hearing is neither here nor there as far as the \ninitial credible fear screening is concerned; indeed, even when the agency is required to \ndeny asylum to certain refugees ultimately, it is clear that asylum officers must still \nallow such persons to proceed beyond the credible fear stage of the process.  Cf. 8 \nC.F.R. § 208.30(e)(5)(i) (indicating that not even mandatory grounds for denial of \nasylum are sufficient to warrant an adverse determination at the credible fear stage). \n  This all means that USCIS is not free to add factors that the regulations \nrecognize at other stages of the process to the considerations that an asylum officer \nmust take into account during the credible fear assessment.  Yet, that is precisely what \nthe Lesson Plan does.  (See, e.g., Lesson Plan at 19–20, 25, 36).  And, of course, the \nmere fact that the Lesson Plan cites to the actual text of the regulations concerning the \ndiscretionary factors in the margins of the relevant Lesson Plan pages (see, e.g., Lesson \n64 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 68 of 99\nPlan at 19 (citing 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)) does not alleviate the conflict (see Defs.’ \nMot. at 53 (asserting that the Lesson Plan “direct[s] students to read sections 208 and \n235 of the INA, which are codified at 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158 and 1225 and which draw the \ncontrast between discretionary asylum and the non-discretionary credible fear process” \nand suggesting that, as a result, “the Lesson Plan is completely consistent with the \nINA”)).  If anything, such citations only serve to create confusion, inasmuch as they \nunderscore the discrepancies between the Lesson Plan’s dictates and the statutes and \nregulations upon which the agency’s training materials are purportedly based.  \n  The bottom line is this: the Lesson Plan plainly contradicts the unambiguous text \nof the INA and its implementing regulations in this significant regard, and nothing in \nDefendants’ motion or argument demonstrates that the Lesson Plan faithfully describes \nwhat the governing prescriptions establish regarding how USCIS asylum officers are \nsupposed to identify a noncitizen who has a credible fear of persecution.      \nc.  The Lesson Plan Places A Burden On The Asylum Seeker \nWho Suffered Past Persecution To Show Unchanged Country \nConditions And The Unavailability Of Internal Relocation \nAs Prerequisites For A Favorable Credible Fear \nDetermination  \nThe third example in the category of direct contradictions between the \nunambiguous text of the INA and the Lesson Plan is straightforward: the Lesson Plan \nnot only impermissibly requires asylum officers making credible fear assessments to \nconsider discretionary factors that are applicable only during the full asylum review \nprocess, but also places the burden of making these showings on the asylum seeker.  To \naccomplish this, the Lesson Plan states that, unless the noncitizen “establish[es] each \none of the elements below,” he or she “must receive a negative credible fear \n65 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 69 of 99\ndetermination” (Lesson Plan at 20), and one of the listed elements is “Future Fear \n(Well-Founded Fear)[,]” which the Lesson Plan says requires, among other things, a \nshowing by the noncitizen that is sufficient to “demonstrate[]” either “past persecution \nbased on continuing country conditions” or a “well-founded fear” of persecution (id.).  \nAnother element that noncitizens must establish to avoid a negative credible fear \ndetermination under the Lesson Plan concerns “Internal Relocation” (id. at 25); that is, \nwhen the noncitizen fears persecution by non-government actors, she bears the burden \nof demonstrating that there is “a significant possibility that the applicant cannot \nreasonably internally relocate within his or her country” (id. at 25; see also id. at 20 \n(“[I]f the evidence does not establish a significant possibility . . . [that] internal \nrelocation is not possible, a negative credible fear determination is appropriate”)).  In \nthis regard, the Lesson Plan specifically requires asylum officers “to assess whether an \napplicant could relocate to another area of his or her home country in order to avoid the \nalleged persecution[,]” because, “[i]f such internal relocation is reasonable, the \napplicant does not have a credible fear of persecution.”  (Id. at 16.)   \nThese evidentiary burdens are plainly at odds with the regulations that pertain to \ncredible fear determinations.  (See Pls.’ Mot. at 42–43.)  For instance, under the \nregulations, a presumption of asylum eligibility due to past persecution may be rebutted \nat the full removal hearing stage if the agency shows, by a preponderance of the \nevidence, that the conditions in the country of origin have changed.  See 8 C.F.R. \n§ 208.13(b)(1)(i)(A).  But, as explained, in the Lesson Plan, it is the noncitizen who \nmust show that those country conditions continue even if her asylum request is based on \npast persecution, and she must do so at the credible fear stage of the process.  (See \n66 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 70 of 99\nLesson Plan at 20.)  Furthermore, even though the regulations permit agency officials to \nexercise the discretion to deny asylum when a preponderance of the evidence \nestablishes that an applicant who suffered past persecution might be able to reasonably \nrelocate within her country of origin, see 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)(i)(B), the Lesson Plan \nplainly flips that burden onto the shoulders of those credible fear interviewees (see \nLesson Plan at 16, 25).  Thus, for this reason, too, this aspect of the Lesson Plan \nconflicts with the INA’s implementing regulations.    \n3.  Certain Provisions Of The Lesson Plan Are Based Upon An \nUnreasonable Interpretation Of The INA’s Asylum Review Process \nIn addition to those parts of the Lesson Plan that contradict the express \nrequirements of the INA and its implementing regulations concerning what is necessary \nfor noncitizens to be considered to have a credible fear such that they advance to full \nremoval proceedings, as described above, other parts of the Lesson Plan establish \nunreasonable standards for the credible fear determination with respect to matters that \nCongress has not specifically addressed, given the thrust of what the INA and its \nregulations prescribe.  Put in Chevron and Kisor parlance, the following Lesson Plan \nprovisions can be said to be based on an unreasonable interpretation of the INA, and \nthereby exceeded the reasonable boundaries of any ambiguity to be found in the statute \nand related regulations.    \na.  The Lesson Plan’s Mandate That Noncitizens Provide \n“Evidence” And “Facts” That Pertain To “Every Element” \nOf Their Asylum Claim Is Plainly Unreasonable Given The \nStatutory Requirements \nDuring full removal proceedings, an asylum seeker must offer specific facts that \npertain to every element necessary to show that she is a refugee.  See 8 U.S.C. \n67 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 71 of 99\n§ 1158(b)(1)(B)(i) (“To establish that the applicant is a refugee within the meaning of \n[section 1101(a)(42)(A) of the INA], the applicant must establish that race, religion, \nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion was or will be \nat least one central reason for persecuting the applicant.”); see also Matter of A-B-, 27 \nI. & N. Dec. 316, 340 (A.G. 2018), abrogated on other grounds, Grace II, 965 F.3d 883 \n(explaining that, during full removal proceedings, an asylum applicant “must present \nfacts that undergird each of the[] elements” necessary to establish eligibility for \nasylum, and the agency “has the duty to determine whether those facts satisfy all of the \nlegal requirements for asylum”).  But the INA is silent with respect to the standard of \nproof that applies when a noncitizen is undergoing an assessment for credible fear of \npersecution: all that Congress says is that there must be “a significant possibility . . . \nthat the alien could establish eligibility for asylum[.]”  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v).   \nThe Lesson Plan fills this gap by providing that “[t]he applicant bears the burden \nof proof to establish a credible fear of persecution” by “produc[ing] sufficiently \nconvincing evidence that establishes the facts of the case, and that those facts must \nsatisfy every element of the relevant legal standard[.]”  (Lesson Plan at 11.)  It further \nemphasizes that, “[i]n order to establish a credible fear of persecution, the applicant \nmust establish each one of the elements” listed in the Lesson Plan (id. at 20), and that \n“[i]f the applicant is not able to establish all of the elements, the applicant must receive \na negative credible fear determination” (id.).  According to the Lesson Plan, the \nnecessary elements that a noncitizen must establish at the credible fear stage, by \noffering facts and evidence that go to each element, are: (1) a well-founded fear of \npersecution, (2) based on either past persecution or a risk of future persecution (3) due \n68 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 72 of 99\nto membership in a particular social group, in addition to the discretionary elements for \ndenial of asylum discussed above, such as (4) continuing country conditions and \n(5) inability to relocate internally.  (See Lesson Plan at 21–26.)   \nThe task of determining whether the Lesson Plan’s interpretation is a \n“permissible” or “reasonable” one, Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843–44; Kisor, 139 S. Ct. at \n2416, necessarily requires the Court to focus on the purpose of credible fear interviews \nas Congress envisioned them, see Goldstein v. S.E.C., 451 F.3d 873, 881 (D.C. Cir. \n2006) (explaining that, whether an agency’s construction is reasonable depends, in part, \n“on the construction’s fit with the statutory language, as well as its conformity to \nstatutory purposes” (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); see also Kisor, 139 \nS. Ct. at 2416 (same for regulatory provisions).  As discussed above, it is clear beyond \ncavil that the credible fear evaluation is intended to be merely an initial screening \ninterview that poses a relatively low bar for asylum applicants, see Thuraissigiam, 140 \nS. Ct. at 1965; see also Yang, 99 F. App’x at 125 (explaining that “the credible fear \ninterview does not require the level of detail expected of the petitioner for an asylum \nclaim”); therefore, the required reasonableness analysis need not detain the Court for \nlong.  \nAgain, section 1225’s text plainly indicates that an asylum applicant can be \nfound to have a credible fear when the asylum officer concludes that the noncitizen \nmight be able to establish the elements of her claim with the assistance of counsel \nduring the subsequent full removal proceeding, even if the noncitizen cannot be said to \nhave established all of those elements at the time of her credible fear interview.  (See \nPls.’ Reply at 29); see also 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v).  The INA’s implementing \n69 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 73 of 99\nregulations also make clear that the credible fear interview is only designed “to elicit all \nrelevant and useful information bearing on whether the applicant has a credible fear of \npersecution,” 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(d), and USCIS’s Form I-870—which asylum officers \nuse to take notes during credible fear interviews—expressly indicates that “[t]here may \nbe areas of the individual’s claim that were not explored or documented for purposes of \nthis threshold screening” (Ex. 11 to Admin. Record, ECF No. 61-10, at 5).   \nIn sum, it is entirely unreasonable for the Lesson Plan to demand that, during the \ncredible fear interview, the noncitizen establish “facts” that “satisfy every element” of \nher future asylum claim as a prerequisite to getting a favorable credible fear \ndetermination.  (Lesson Plan at 11.)  Imposing such a requirement is tantamount to \nmaking asylum applicants prove that they are a refugee during their credible fear \ninterviews, even though Congress has made abundantly clear that a noncitizen need \nonly carry that burden after she has shown a credible fear of persecution and has been \nplaced in full removal proceedings.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(ii).  Put another way, \neven though the statute and regulations do not speak directly to the standard of proof \nthat is applicable at the credible fear stage of the asylum eligibility process, the one that \nthe Lesson Plan adopts is not based on a reasonable interpretation of those binding \nstatutory and regulatory requirements.   \nb.  The Lesson Plan Unreasonably Permits Asylum Officers To \nRequire Corroboration In The Context Of The Credible Fear \nInterview Process \nThe Lesson Plan erects another impermissible hurdle for noncitizens at the initial \nstage of the asylum eligibility process, to the extent that it provides that “the asylum \nofficer is . . . entitled to determine that the applicant must provide evidence that \n70 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 74 of 99\ncorroborates the applicant’s testimony, even where the officer might otherwise find the \ntestimony credible.”  (Lesson Plan at 12.)  The Lesson Plan states that, “[i]n cases in \nwhich the asylum officer determines that the applicant must provide such evidence, the \nasylum officer must provide the applicant notice and the opportunity to submit \nevidence, and the applicant must provide the evidence unless the applicant cannot \nreasonably obtain the evidence.”  (Id. (emphasis in the original).)  To be sure, at the \npoint in which the Lesson Plan provides this authority for asylum officers to mandate \ncorroboration, it cites the general statutory and regulatory provisions that apply to \ncredible fear determinations.  (See id. (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v); 8 C.F.R. \n§ 208.30(e)(2)).)  But nothing about eliciting corroborating evidence appears in those \nprovisions.  And, in fact, USCIS seems to have imported the corroboration standards \nfrom the statutory provision that addresses full asylum proceedings, see 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1158(b)(1)(B)(ii), and adopted those standards nearly verbatim with respect to the \nLesson Plan’s instructions for making a credible fear determination.  \nThus, once again, the question for this Court is whether it is reasonable for the \nagency to employ a standard that applies to full asylum proceedings—i.e., the authority \nto request corroboration—in the context of the credible fear process, given the INA’s \npurposes and in light of relevant statutory and regulatory language.  See Chevron, 467 \nU.S. at 843–44; Kisor, 139 S. Ct. at 2416.  And for the reasons that follow, given both \n“the goals of the statute[,]” Vill. of Barrington, Ill. v. Surface Transp. Bd., 636 F.3d \n650, 660 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), and the \n“statutory purposes[,]” Abbott Labs. v. Young, 920 F.2d 984, 988 (D.C. Cir. 1990), the \n71 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 75 of 99\nCourt cannot discern a reasonable fit between the Lesson Plan’s corroboration \nrequirement and the credible fear process that Congress created.   \nThe legislative history of the credible fear provision provides one lens through \nwhich to view Congress’ intent with respect to a noncitizen’s burden during the credible \nfear stage of the asylum application process.  An early draft of the 1996 amendments to \nthe INA provided that, “in order to establish a credible fear of persecution, the \napplicant for asylum would need to establish that ‘it is more probable than not that the \nstatements made by the alien in support of the alien’s claim are true, and . . . there is a \nsignificant possibility, in light of such statements . . . that the alien could establish \neligibility for asylum.’”  H. Rep. No. 104-469, at 529 (Mar. 4, 1996).  However, certain \nmembers of the House of Representatives and the Senate believed that that was “simply \ntoo onerous a standard for an asylee to meet who has just escaped dangerous \npersecution.”  Id.  And, ultimately, Congress “struck a compromise by rejecting the \nhigher standard of credibility included in the House bill” and adopting the enacted \ncredible fear provision, which was “intended to be a low screening standard for \nadmission into the usual full asylum process.”  142 Cong. Rec. S11,491 (daily ed. Sept. \n27, 1996) (statement of Sen. Hatch).   \nIt is certainly true that “credible fear interviewees are [reasonably] asked to \nprovide all of the reasons for their concern about being removed,” Zhang, 585 F.3d at \n724 (emphasis in original), but “they are not required to give a detailed and specific \naccount of the bases for their claims, as applicants for asylum must in their asylum \napplication[,]” id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Thus, the Lesson \nPlan’s instruction that an asylum officer might require the interviewee to “provide \n72 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 76 of 99\nevidence that corroborates the applicant’s testimony, even where the officer might \notherwise find the testimony credible” (Lesson Plan at 12 (emphasis added))—i.e., even \nwhen “the credibility of the statements made by the alien in support of the alien’s \nclaim” is not in question, 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v)—clearly transforms the credible \nfear interview, which is a mere screening process that is primarily focused on assessing \nthe noncitizen’s credibility as a means of determining whether she could ultimately and \neventually establish refugee status, into a probing quest for evidence that is virtually \nindistinguishable from full asylum eligibility proceedings.   \nConsequently, this Court has little doubt that the Lesson Plan’s authorization of \ndemands for corroboration at the credible fear stage rests on an unreasonable \ninterpretation of what the INA and its implementing regulations allow.  (See Pls.’ Mot. \nat 46–47.) \nc.  The Lesson Plan Unreasonably Requires The Screening \nOfficer To Consider Whether The Noncitizen’s Home \nGovernment Has “Abdicated Its Responsibility” To Control \nPersecution \nThe Lesson Plan’s effort to assist asylum officers with the core task of \nidentifying when a noncitizen has a credible fear of persecution by defining the term \n“persecution”—which the INA does not specifically address—is impermissible for \nsubstantially similar reasons.  At least ever since Matter of Acosta, 19 I. & N. Dec. 211 \n(B.I.A. 1985), the term “persecution” as it appears in the INA has been understood to \nrefer to “harm or suffering . . . inflicted either by the government of a country or by \npersons or an organization that the government was unable or unwilling to control[,]” \nid. at 222; see also generally Bringas-Rodriguez v. Sessions, 850 F.3d 1051, 1062–69 \n(9th Cir. 2017) (collecting cases applying the “unable or unwilling” standard).  In \n73 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 77 of 99\nGrace II, the D.C. Circuit set aside the agency’s attempts to recharacterize the “unable \nor unwilling” standard as referring solely to circumstances in which the noncitizen’s \nhome country has “condoned the behavior or demonstrated a complete helplessness to \nprotect the victim.”  Grace II, 965 F.3d at 897 (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted).16  But USCIS continues in this impermissible vein with the language that it \nhas adopted in the Lesson Plan:  it explains that, “[f]or a credible fear of persecution, \nthere must be a significant possibility the applicant can establish that the entity that \nharmed the applicant (the persecutor) is . . . an entity that the government is unable or \nunwilling to control[,]” but because “[a]sylum officers must recognize that no \ngovernment can guarantee the safety of each of its citizens or control all potential \npersecutors at all times[,]” “[i]t is not sufficient for an applicant to assert that the \ngovernment lacks sufficient resources to address criminal activity[;] [r]ather, the \ngovernment must have abdicated its responsibility to control persecution.”  (Lesson \nPlan at 23–24 (emphasis added).)   \nThis Court finds that the Lesson Plan’s guidance is a departure from prior agency \nregulations and adjudications, and one that is not owed deference under Kisor, for \nlargely the same reasons that D.C. Circuit expressed in Grace II.  Specifically, a \ngovernment need not entirely abdicate its protection duties in order to be unable to \ncontrol persecution by third parties.  (See Pls.’ Mot. at 47 (arguing that the Lesson Plan \n \n16 According to the D.C. Circuit, those two “formulations” of the standard for persecution are “hardly \ninterchangeable” for at least two reasons: first, “[a] government that ‘condones’ or is ‘completely \nhelpless’ in the face of persecution is obviously more culpable, or more incompetent, than one that is \nsimply ‘unwilling or unable’ to protect its citizens[,]” Grace II, 965 F.3d at 898–99; and, second, when \napplied to the same set of facts, the two formulations may lead to opposite outcomes, see id. at 899 \n(discussing Rosales Justo v. Sessions, 895 F.3d 154, 159 (1st Cir. 2018)).   \n74 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 78 of 99\nimproperly “conflates the two prongs of the relevant standard—that the government be \n‘unable or unwilling to control’ the persecutor”).)  Moreover, that distinction is \nimportant, because the Lesson Plan’s reformulation might well lead asylum officers to \nmake an adverse credible fear determination in cases where it would be appropriate to \nfind that the noncitizen does have a credible fear of persecution using the BIA’s unable-\nor-unwilling standard.   \nTo understand why this is so, consider the example that the D.C. Circuit \ncontemplated in Grace II:  where a person seeks asylum after the murder of their child \ndue to the devastating impact of organized crime in their home community, the fact that \nthe local authorities “responded to the crime scene, took statements from the asylum \nseeker and his wife, and autopsied the body[,]” Grace II, 965 F.3d at 899, indicates that \nthe government had not necessarily “abdicated its responsibility to control persecution” \n(Lesson Plan at 24); however, if there is evidence that “organized criminals generally \noperated with impunity” in the community nonetheless, the government can rightly be \nsaid to be unable to offer its citizens protection, Grace II, 965 F.3d at 899.  \nConsequently, USCIS cannot reasonably instruct its officers that the hallmark of \n“unwilling or unable” is that the government has abdicated its responsibility to protect \nits citizens without running afoul of its prior pronouncement that a credible fear of \npersecution can be established based on the government’s inability to afford adequate \nprotection.  Cf. Kisor, 139 S. Ct. at 2417–18. \nDefendants’ arguments to the contrary are not persuasive.  Defendants maintain \nthat, “when read in context and with the deference it is due,” the Lesson Plan does not \nunlawfully change the unable-or-unwilling standard; its “discussion of a government \n75 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 79 of 99\nabdicating its responsibility to control a persecutor is simply explanatory, provided as a \ncounterpoint to the explanation that it is not enough to merely show that the government \nlacks resources[.]”  (Defs.’ Reply at 37 (emphasis added).)  But, of course, an \nexplanation that does not faithfully adhere to the statutory or regulatory standard that it \npurports to explicate is owed no deference.  See Circus Circus Casinos, Inc. v. \nN.L.R.B., 961 F.3d 469, 483 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (“Courts do not defer to an agency’s \narbitrary and capricious interpretation of its own standard.”).  And, here, as in Grace II, \nthe agency’s explanation portends a situation in which asylum officers “can choose \nbetween the two standards”—“unwilling or unable” versus abdication of the duty to \nprotect—such that a noncitizen “appearing before one official may suffer deportation” \nwhile an “identically situated” noncitizen “appearing before another may gain the right \nto stay in this country.”  Grace II, 965 F.3d at 900 (internal quotation marks, alteration, \nand citation omitted).   \nThus, this Court finds the Lesson Plan’s effort to illuminate the meaning of \n“persecution” is not based on a reasonable interpretation of the “unable or unwilling” \nstandard that the agency had previously announced in its adjudications interpreting that \nterm, and is therefore impermissible.  \nD.  The Unlawful Provisions Of The Lesson Plan Cannot Be Severed From \nThe Remainder Of The Document, So The Court Will Exercise Its \nEquitable Authority To Vacate The Entire Lesson Plan And Will Also \nOrder New Credible Fear Determinations For These Plaintiffs  \nBased on the prior discussion, the Court has concluded that certain parts of \nUSCIS’s “Lesson Plan on Credible Fear of Persecution and Torture Determinations” \nconflict with the INA and its implementing regulations in various ways, as Plaintiffs \n76 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 80 of 99\nallege in their complaint.  (See Section IV.C., supra.)17  Accordingly, Plaintiffs are \nentitled to summary judgment with respect to the first claim for relief in their \ncomplaint, given the Court’s conclusion that certain parts of the Lesson Plan \nimpermissibly conflict with the INA and its implementing regulations as a matter of \nlaw.  (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 90, 92–93.)  Plaintiffs have presented the remaining claims \nfor relief—including their contention that the Lesson Plan violates the notice-and-\ncomment provisions of the APA—in the “alternative” (Pls.’ Mot. at 39); therefore, the \nCourt need not proceed to evaluate Plaintiffs’ APA and constitutional claims at this \njuncture.  Instead, the question now becomes what remedy is appropriately afforded to \nthese Plaintiffs based upon their success in establishing their entitlement to relief with \nrespect to their first claim.   \nIn this regard, Defendants insist that, per the terms of section 1252(e)(3), the \nCourt can only issue a declaratory judgment—i.e., the Court “may only determine the \n \n17 The Court is not convinced that the other provisions of the Lesson Plan that are highlighted in \nPlaintiffs’ complaint constitute similarly unlawful agency action.  Specifically, the complaint alleges \nthat the Lesson Plan conflicts with the INA and its regulations in three additional respects.  Plaintiffs \nmaintain that the Lesson Plan impermissibly (1) instructs that the asylum seeker must establish greater \nthan “a 1 in 10 chance of future persecution” (see Am. Compl. ¶ 82(b)); (2) requires asylum officers “to \nmeasure the asylum seeker’s statements against information in Department of State-issued reports . . . \nand to treat the reports as ‘objective’ fact” (see ¶ 84(a)); and (3) suggests that asylum officers “need \nnot provide the asylum seeker with an opportunity to address concerns that might lead to a negative \ncredibility determination” (see ¶ 84(b)).  In this Court’s view, none of these provisions constitutes an \nirreconcilable conflict between the Lesson Plan and the applicable statutory and regulatory provisions.  \nThe Lesson Plan plainly clarifies that the Supreme Court’s discussion of a one-in-ten chance of \npersecution in I.N.S. v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 431–32 (1987), was dicta.  (See Lesson Plan at \n21–22.)  The applicable regulations permit asylum officers to rely on “material provided by the \nDepartment of State[,]” see 8 C.F.R. § 208.12(a), and the Lesson Plan’s requirement that officers \nconsult such material does not conflict with that authorization.  Nor does the Lesson Plan’s directive \nthat asylum officers “should follow up” on credibility concerns and “should give the applicant and \nopportunity to explain all concerns” (Lesson Plan at 16 (emphasis added)) suggest that officers need \nnot do so in a manner that contradicts or undermines the asylum officers’ obligation to elicit all \nrelevant and useful information, as required under the applicable regulations, see 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(d), \nand as clearly stated in the Lesson Plan (see Lesson Plan at 11).   \n77 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 81 of 99\nLesson Plan’s lawfulness, and lacks statutory authority to enjoin or vacate the Lesson \nPlan or stay removals.”  (Defs.’ Mot. at 63.)   The Court rejects this unfounded \ncontention for the reasons explained below.  To the contrary, it is well settled that \nfederal courts have equitable power to order the vacatur of unlawful agency conduct— \nin whole or in part—and nothing in the INA restricts or withdraws that established \nauthority.  Furthermore, in the instant case, it is appropriate for the Court to vacate the \nLesson Plan in its entirety, because the unlawful provisions are not severable from the \nrest of the document.  In addition, to ensure that Plaintiffs are made whole, the Court \nhas determined that a limited injunction that requires USCIS to void Plaintiff’s credible \nfear determinations, and provide new ones as necessary to evaluate their entitlement to \npress their asylum claims in full removal proceedings, is warranted.  \n1.  Vacatur Is An Appropriate Remedy Under These Circumstances  \nIt is blackletter law that vacatur is “a form of equitable relief that the Court may \naward, withhold, and craft to fit the circumstances of the case before it.”  Sierra Forest \nLegacy v. Sherman, 951 F. Supp. 2d 1100, 1106 (E.D. Cal. 2013); see also 73A C.J.S. \nPublic Administrative Law and Procedure § 552 (Sept. 2020) (explaining that “vacatur \nis a species of equitable relief”).  Indeed, according to the D.C. Circuit, when a \nreviewing court declares that the challenged action of an administrative agency violates \nthe law, vacatur is the “normal remedy,” Allina Health Servs. v. Sebelius, 746 F.3d \n1102, 1110 (D.C. Cir. 2014), and the “ordinary result” that follows from the court’s \ndetermination, Nat’l Mining Ass’n v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 145 F.3d 1399, 1409 \n(D.C. Cir. 1998).  In essence, a vacatur order takes the unlawful agency action “off the \nbooks[,]” AFL-CIO v. Chao, 496 F. Supp. 2d 76, 92 (D.D.C. 2007), which is an entirely \n78 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 82 of 99\nappropriate response when a plaintiff successfully establishes that the agency’s conduct \nviolates the law, see, e.g., Int’l Union, United Mine Workers of Am. v. Fed. Mine Safety \nand Health Admin., 920 F.2d 960, 966–67 (D.C. Cir. 1990).  \nIt is notable that federal courts have equitable power to order vacatur even in the \nabsence of a specific statutory authorization.  See 73A C.J.S. Public Administrative Law \nand Procedure § 552 (Sept. 2020); see also Franklin v. Gwinnett Cty. Pub. Sch., 503 \nU.S. 60, 70–71 (1992) (“The general rule . . . is that absent clear direction to the \ncontrary by Congress, the federal courts have the power to award any appropriate relief \nin a cognizable cause of action brought pursuant to a federal statute.”).  But the \nappropriateness of such relief is further underscored by the fact that Congress has \nspecifically prescribed this particular remedy when agency action violates the law and \nthe plaintiff brings her claim under the APA.  See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2) (stating that, under \nthe specified circumstances, a “reviewing court shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside \nagency action”).  \nNothing in the INA divests the federal courts of their traditional power to vacate \nunlawful agency action.  (But see Defs.’ Mot. at 62–67.)  In support of the argument \nthat this Court cannot vacate the Lesson Plan, Defendants first point to section \n1252(e)(1)(A), which provides that “no court may enter declaratory, injunctive, or other \nequitable relief in any action pertaining to an order to exclude an alien in accordance \nwith section 1225(b)(1) of this title except as specifically authorized in a subsequent \nparagraph of this subsection[.]”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(1)(A).  The agency reads this \nprovision to strip federal courts of all such equitable remedies in all circumstances.  \n(See Defs.’ Mot. at 63.)  But as the D.C. Circuit recently explained, section \n79 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 83 of 99\n1252(e)(1)(A) is inapplicable to “challenges on the validity of the expedited-removal \nsystem”—like the one at issue here—given that such challenges are “authorized in a \nsubsequent paragraph” of the INA, namely section 1252(e)(3).  Grace II, 965 F.3d at \n907 (internal quotation marks, citations, and alterations omitted).  In addition, Congress \nmust have meant for section 1252(e)(1)(A)’s restrictions to apply only when a court is \ncalled upon to examine “underlying credible-fear determinations[,]” id.; otherwise, it \nwould have “expressly authorized the district court to review expedited-removal \npolicies yet simultaneously prohibited it from issuing any remedies[,]” id. \nDefendants’ second statutory argument (see Defs.’ Mot. at 66) is similarly \nunpersuasive.  The agency observes that section 1252(e)(3)(A) authorizes the United \nStates District Court for the District of Columbia to make a “determination[]” regarding \nwhether certain regulations and written policies are valid, see 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(A), \nand because a “determination” can theoretically be conceived of as a form of \ndeclaratory relief, Defendants surmise that the sole “specifically authorized remedy” in \nthe relevant subsequent paragraph, as per section 1252(e)(1)(A), is a declaration that \nthe agency’s written policy is unlawful.  (See Defs.’ Mot. at 66.)  Of course, this \ninterpretation ignores the fact that section 1252(e)(3) is not addressed to remedies.  \nMoreover, the clear context of that provision’s reference to “determinations” is that \nCongress is authorizing the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to \nundertake judicial review of the implementation of the expedited removal scheme, but \nfurther specifying that such review “shall be limited to determinations of” certain legal \nissues, including whether the written policy directive, guideline, or procedure is \nconsistent with the INA.  8 U.S.C § 1252(e)(3)(A)(ii).  Establishing that this Court is \n80 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 84 of 99\nauthorized to determine specified legal issues cannot be logically equated with the \nremedies that the Court may prescribe once such a determination has been made.  See \nGrace II, 965 F.3d at 907 (“‘Determination’ . . . denotes a decision, not a remedy.”)  \nWhat is more, the D.C. Circuit considered and rejected Defendants’ declaration-only \ninterpretation in Grace II, when it upheld in part an injunction that the district court had \nissued as a remedy for a legal determination that the district judge made pursuant to \nsection 1252(e)(3).  See id. at 908–09. \nStill, Defendants argue that, even if the INA itself does not place limits on this \nCourt’s remedial powers, a vacatur is not appropriate in this case as a matter of the \nequities.  (See Defs.’ Mot. at 65 (citing Allied-Signal, Inc. v. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory \nComm’n, 988 F.2d 146, 150–51 (D.C. Cir. 1993).)  To be sure, courts “have commonly \nremanded without vacating an agency’s rule or order where the failure lay in lack of \nreasoned decisionmaking, [and] also where the order was otherwise arbitrary and \ncapricious[.]”  Int’l Union, 920 F.2d at 966; see also Allied-Signal, 988 F.2d at 150 \n(remanding without vacating where the agency action is “inadequately supported”).  But \nwhere the agency action is “so crippled as to be unlawful[,]” and not simply \n“potentially lawful but insufficiently or inappropriately explained[,]” it is clear beyond \ncavil that the common “practice is to vacate the agency’s order[.]”  Radio-Television \nNews Directors Ass’n v. F.C.C., 184 F.3d 872, 888 (D.C. Cir. 1999).  Thus, Defendants \ncannot reasonably dispute that vacatur is the norm where, as here, the deficiencies that \nthe court has identified are “substantively fatal[.]”  Int’l Union, 920 F.2d at 967.  \nDefendants’ other remedy-related contention (see Defs.’ Mot. at 63) is also \nbaseless.  They insist that, absent a class action—which Congress has expressly \n81 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 85 of 99\nprohibited in this context, see 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(1)(B)—“the Court has no authority to \nvacate or enter an injunction against the Lesson Plan,” but may only “order limited \nsystemic relief at the behest of individual aliens.”  (Defs.’ Mot. at 63.)  (See also Defs.’ \nGrace Brief at 12 (“[I]n no event, and for no claims, should any relief extend beyond \nthe five Plaintiffs here[.]”).)  With this argument, Defendants have cast a standard order \nthat is directed solely to the agency that is before the court and that vacates a particular \npolicy directive that Plaintiffs have successfully challenged (without purporting to \ncreate enforcement rights with respect to anyone other than Plaintiffs) as a “prospective \nnationwide injunction” that inappropriately “reaches the future credible fear \ndeterminations of hundreds of thousands of aliens ‘none of whom are parties to the \nlawsuit,’ and ‘unconstrained by the requirements’ of Rule 23.”  (Defs.’ Mot. at 65.)  \nUnfortunately for Defendants, this Court has seen this play before.  See, e.g., MTRNY I, \n405 F. Supp. 3d at 71 (rejecting similar contentions), rev’d on other grounds, MTRNY \nII, 962 F.3d 612.  And in the end, contrary to Defendants’ representations, it is the \n“long-held understanding that once a rule is vacated, it is vacated for everyone.”  \nD.A.M. v. Barr, No. 20-cv-1321, 2020 WL 5525056, at *7 (D.D.C. Sept. 15, 2020). \nIt suffices to note here that the argument that a court can only vacate the \nagency’s unlawful conduct with respect to the particular plaintiffs who have filed the \nlegal action that is before it has no grounding in the Article III doctrine or in any \nfederal statute of which this Court is aware.  This argument also conveniently ignores \nthe fact that what is at issue in the lawsuit is the agency’s unlawful conduct—here, its \nissuance of a binding instruction manual that contains provisions that conflict with the \nINA—and that conduct, when it was undertaken, was not directed at the Plaintiffs in \n82 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 86 of 99\nthis lawsuit.  Thus, where the legal claim at issue is the unlawfulness of an agency \naction of general applicability, it makes no sense whatsoever to insist that a district \ncourt limit its vacatur to address solely the impact of the unlawful agency action on the \nplaintiffs.  In fact, doing so is tantamount to transforming a facial challenge to agency \nconduct into an as applied claim.  It defies both law and logic.        \nIt is also worth observing that no less an authority than the Supreme Court has \nmade it abundantly clear that injunctions and vacaturs are distinct remedies, and that \nthe latter is considered substantially less intrusive.  See Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed \nFarms, 561 U.S. 139, 165–66 (2010) (explaining that injunctive relief is “a drastic and \nextraordinary remedy, which should not be granted as a matter of course[,]” whereas a \n“partial or complete vacatur” of an agency’s action is a different, “less drastic remedy” \nthat, at times, might be “sufficient to redress” a plaintiff’s injury); see also Dep’t of \nHomeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of California, 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1916 n.7 (2020) \n(recognizing this distinction by holding that affirmance of the “order vacating the \n[agency action] makes it unnecessary to examine the propriety of the nationwide scope \nof the injunctions”).  And given the established and lengthy history of federal courts \nemploying their equitable powers to vacate unlawful agency actions, Defendants’ \nprofessed concern that a vacatur would “reach[] the future credible fear determinations \nof hundreds of thousands of aliens none of whom are parties to the lawsuit” (Defs.’ \nMot. at 65 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)) is really neither here nor \nthere when it comes to demonstrating that this Court lacks the authority to issue a \nvacatur order in this case.  That is to say, the mere fact that a vacatur order may happen \nto confer a possible benefit upon other individuals who are not before the Court—\n83 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 87 of 99\nindeed, conceivably, any and every person who might have otherwise been subjected to \nthe government’s unlawful conduct benefits from its vacatur—is not a reason to \nconclude that the Court lacks the power to nullify the unlawful government practice; \nindeed, that collateral consequence is wholly irrelevant to the determination of whether \nor not a standard vacatur order is appropriate to remedy the violation of law that the \ncourt has pronounced.  Regardless, if a court concludes that an agency action violates \nthe law, vacatur is routinely ordered to address that substantively unlawful conduct, \nnotwithstanding the alleged windfall that the nullification gives to nonparties (if being \nshielded from violative agency action can even rationally be considered as such).   \nThe Court notes further that this typical result has rarely been an issue, because \nan administrative agency that is acting in good faith and in the public’s interest can be \nexpected to heed the implications of the federal court’s ruling and desist voluntarily \nfrom engaging in conduct that the court has deemed unlawful (at least pending its \nappeal of the court’s determination) in any event.  See Ramirez de Arellano v. \nWeinberger, 745 F.2d 1500, 1565 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (en banc) (Scalia, J., dissenting) \n(explaining that “it must be assumed that officers of the Executive Branch will honor \ntheir oath to uphold the laws of the United States[,]” and therefore “once a court takes it \nupon itself to pronounce that the actions challenged here are unlawful all of the adverse \neffects of injunction . . . ensue”); see also Alsea Valley All. v. Dep’t of Commerce, 358 \nF.3d 1181, 1186 (9th Cir. 2004) (explaining that a vacatur “prohibits, as a practical \nmatter, the enforcement” of an unlawful agency action, but is not actually “the practical \nequivalent of ‘enjoining’” the agency, and noting that such reasoning, “[t]aken to its \nlogical end,” would “classify as ‘injunctive’ all declaratory relief that deems an agency \n84 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 88 of 99\nrule unlawful”).  It has apparently only been in recent years that federal agencies have \nconsistently and audaciously demanded an entitlement to persist in the unlawful \nconduct despite a federal court’s ruling declaring that conduct unlawful, which has \nmanifested itself in the strange argument that Defendants have presented here—i.e., that \nprecisely because outsiders might benefit from a vacatur, the Court lacks the power to \nvacate the agency action and must instead craft a remedy that permits the agency to \ncontinue to act in flagrant violation of the law as the court has announced it to be with \nrespect to anyone who has not been joined as a party in the case before the court.18     \nYet, here as elsewhere, Defendants have failed to provide any persuasive reason \nwhy the potential incidental benefit that is conferred to the rest of humanity when a \ncourt addresses unlawful agency action by vacating the agency’s conduct is sufficiently \nproblematic, under the Constitution or otherwise, to justify limiting a federal court’s \ntraditional power to nullify the actions of the defendant when that challenged conduct \nviolates the law.  See L.M.-M. v. Cuccinelli, 442 F. Supp. 3d 1, 37 (D.D.C. 2020) \n(explaining that the “consequences” of a vacatur “with respect to parties not before the \nCourt” simply “lie[] beyond this Court’s jurisdiction”).  And there is none, in light of \n“[t]raditional administrative law principles[,]” which dictate that, “[w]hen a reviewing \n \n18 As other district court judges have ably noted, “[f]or the [government] to suggest that they were \nentitled . . . to basically ignore [a court’s] declaratory judgment until after appellate review is \nexhausted is unsupported in the law.”  Florida ex rel. Bondi v. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 780 F. \nSupp. 2d 1307, 1316 (N.D. Fla. 2011) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Moreover, as a practical \nmatter, “[t]he Court does not know how a court vacates a rule only as to one state, one district, or one \nparty[,]” N.M. Health Connections v. Dep’t of Health Human Servs., 340 F. Supp. 3d 1112, 1183 \n(D.N.M. 2018), or what “it [would] mean to ‘vacate’ a rule as to some but not other members of the \npublic[,]” O.A., 404 F. Supp. 3d at 153.  Nevertheless, federal agencies appear to be making a \nconcerted effort to conscript the courts in this tedious self-censoring exercise on the seemingly \nirrelevant grounds that non-parties may be tangentially affected if the court exercises its ordinary \nequitable powers.  See, e.g., MTRNY I, 405 F. Supp. 3d at 71. \n85 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 89 of 99\ncourt determines that agency regulations are unlawful, the ordinary result is that the \nrules are vacated—not that their application to the individual petitioners is proscribed.”  \nHarmon v. Thornburgh, 878 F.2d 484, 495 n.21 (D.C. Cir. 1989); see also Barr v. Am. \nAss’n of Political Consultants, Inc., 140 S. Ct. 2335, 2351 n.8 (2020) (explaining that, \nwhen “a provision [of law] is declared invalid[,]” the invalid provision “cannot be \nlawfully enforced against others”—and not just “against the plaintiff”); Grace v. \nWhitaker, No. 18-cv-1853, 2019 WL 329572, at *2 (D.D.C. Jan. 25, 2019) (“There is no \nstatutory requirement, as the government argues, to declare a policy in violation of the \nlaw only as applied to the individual plaintiffs.”).  In addition, Defendants’ limited \nvacatur argument flies in the fact of the “fundamental” notion that “agency policy is to \nbe made, in the first instance, by the agency itself [and] not by courts[,]” Harmon, 878 \nF.2d at 494, since vacating or enjoining a rule of general applicability only with respect \nto specific parties “would be drawing a line which the agency itself has never drawn[,]”  \nid. at 495.   \nTherefore, in addition to declaring that certain provisions of the Lesson Plan are \nunlawful, this Court will proceed to vacate all or part of the Lesson Plan, as in the \nordinary course, to ensure that USCIS implements the Court’s determination with \nrespect to the agency’s unlawful action.  Cf. A.B.-B., 2020 WL 5107548, at *9 \n(declaring that DHS’s policy to allow CBP officers to conduct credible fear interviews \ninstead of USCIS asylum officers violated the INA, and issuing a preliminary injunction \nunder section 1252(e)(3) that prohibits DHS from implementing its policy of \nauthorizing CBP officers to conduct credible fear screenings). \n86 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 90 of 99\n2.  The Unlawful Provisions Of The Lesson Plan Are Not Severable \nFrom The Remainder Of The Document, Such That Vacatur Of The \nEntire Lesson Plan Is Required \nThe next question that must be answered is whether the Court needs to vacate the \nentire Lesson Plan, or whether the various unlawful provisions that Plaintiffs have \nsuccessfully identified can be severed from the rest of the document.  This Court \nordered the parties to provide supplemental briefing on this issue (see Pls.’ Suppl. Brief \non Severability, ECF No. 68; Defs.’ Suppl. Brief on Severability, ECF No. 69), and \nafter a careful review of both the parties’ arguments and the governing legal standards, \nthe Court has concluded that the unlawful parts of the Lesson Plan described in Section \nIV.C above cannot, and should not, be severed by the Court. \n“Whether an administrative agency’s order or regulation is severable, permitting \na court to affirm it in part and reverse it in part, depends on the issuing agency’s \nintent.”  North Carolina v. F.E.R.C., 730 F.2d 790, 795–96 (D.C. Cir. 1984).  The \nnecessary intent is ordinarily ascertained pursuant to a two-prong test: (1) whether “the \nagency would have adopted the same disposition regarding the unchallenged portion of \nthe regulation if the challenged portion were subtracted[,]” and (2) whether the parts of \nthe regulation that remain can “function sensibly without the stricken provision[,]” \nCarlson v. Postal Regulatory Comm’n, 938 F.3d 337, 351 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (internal \nquotation marks, citations, and alternation omitted).  With respect to the first prong, \nseverance “is improper if there is ‘substantial doubt’ that the agency would have \nadopted the severed portion on its own.”  Davis Cnty. Solid Waste Mgmt. v. E.P.A., 108 \nF.3d 1454, 1459 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (per curiam) (internal citation omitted).  With respect \nto the second factor, the Court asks whether severance “would severely distort the \n87 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 91 of 99\n[agency’s] program and produce a rule strikingly different from any the [agency] has \never considered or promulgated[.]”  MD/DC/DE Broadcasters Ass’n v. F.C.C. \n(“MD/DC/DE I”), 236 F.3d 13, 23 (D.C. Cir. 2001). \nApplication of this standard severability analysis to the facts of the instant case \ncompels the conclusion that the unlawful portions of the Lesson Plan that the Court \ndiscusses above are not severable for at least three reasons.  First, the Lesson Plan’s \nstated purpose is “to explain how to determine whether an alien subject to expedited \nremoval or an arriving stowaway has a credible fear of persecution or torture” (Lesson \nPlan at 2), and the unlawful provisions that this Court has addressed speak directly to \ncritical aspects of the credible fear assessment, such that the Court has “substantial \ndoubt” that Defendants would have adopted a guidance document that excluded the \ndirectives concerning the credible fear determination that this Court has found to be \nunlawful.  North Carolina, 730 F.2d at 796.  Second, it is also hard to imagine how the \nLesson Plan “could function sensibly as a freestanding” guidance document without the \nunlawful provisions.  MD/DC/DE Broadcasters Ass’n v. F.C.C. (“MD/DC/DE II”), 253 \nF.3d 732, 735 (D.C. Cir. 2001).  The various directives are so interwoven that it is \nhighly likely that severance would “severely distort” the binding instructions that the \nagency has issued concerning how to administer the complex system of credible fear \ndeterminations, resulting in a policy document that is “strikingly different” from prior \nversions of the Lesson Plan.  MD/DC/DE I, 236 F.3d at 23.  Third, and even more to the \npoint, setting aside the post-hoc representations that Defendants have made in the \nseverance brief that the Court required them to file during the course of this litigation \n(see, e.g., Defs.’ Suppl. Brief on Severability at 11), USCIS has not made any statement \n88 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 92 of 99\nor given any other indication that it ever intended any of the Lesson Plan’s provisions \nto function independently of the rest, see Sierra Club v. F.E.R.C., 867 F.3d 1357, 1366 \n(D.C. Cir. 2017).  Cf. AFL-CIO v. N.L.R.B., No. 20-cv-0675, 2020 WL 3041384, at *19 \n(D.D.C. June 7, 2020) (observing that, by stating that it “would adopt each of these \namendments individually, or in any combination, regardless of whether any of the other \namendments were made[,]” the agency had specifically addressed severability in the \nchallenged rule (internal citation omitted)).  \nUndaunted, Defendants assert that “[t]here is no doubt that USCIS would have \nissued the Lesson Plan” without the challenged provisions, because “USCIS has \nrepeatedly revised its Lesson Plan” over the years, and “the vast majority of the Lesson \nPlan under review in this case . . . has been included in several past iterations of the \nLesson Plan.”  (Defs.’ Suppl. Brief on Severability at 11.)  But this argument cuts \nagainst the agency’s severability position instead of bolstering it.  For one thing, it \nappears that USCIS issues an entirely new Lesson Plan when there is an update, instead \nof maintaining previous portions and repealing only certain segments as circumstances \nchange.  (See, e.g., Defs.’ Status Report, ECF No. 58, at 1 (explaining that “the primary \neffect of the September 2019 Lesson Plan[,]” which replaced the April 2019 Lesson \nPlan, “is to incorporate a discussion of a new immigration administrative decision, \nMatter of L-E-A-, 27 I. & N. Dec. 581 (A.G. 2019)”).)  This editorial prerogative \nindicates the connectedness of the document’s directives and the agency’s apparent \nview that particular provisions of this manual are not wholly independent of the rest.  \nCf., e.g., Am. Petroleum Inst. v. E.P.A., 862 F.3d 50, 71–72 (D.C. Cir. 2017) \n(explaining that the court could not find that two provisions were “wholly independent” \n89 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 93 of 99\nbecause “[a]t no point in the record does EPA propose keeping [one provision] and \nrepealing [the other]”).  It is also clear from the redlined version of the Lesson Plan that \nPlaintiffs have filed to indicate the changes that the agency made to produce the April \n2019 version (see Ex. A to Pls.’ Mot., ECF No. 36-3, at 4–72) that the challenged \nportions are not isolated in the least; they involve hundreds of line strikes and \nadditions, which manifests the author’s intent to integrate these edits into the training \nmaterials in a manner that is comprehensive and wholesale.19   \nThat said, this Court acknowledges the validity of Defendants’ concern that \n“completely vacating the Lesson Plan” with immediate effect “would leave USCIS \nwithout an up-to-date training document reflecting the latest legal developments, and \ninstead force the agency to teach officers on materials that no longer reflect the law[.]”  \n(Defs.’ Suppl. Brief on Severability at 16.)  Of course, this Court has ruled that the \ncurrent version of the training manual does not accurately reflect the law, and the \ninability to rely on an unlawful policy document is the ordinary impact of the vacatur of \nsuch agency action.  Also, after more than a year of litigation over the particular \nprovisions of the Lesson Plan that are specifically identified in Plaintiffs’ complaint, \nDefendants cannot reasonably complain that the Court’s ruling catches them off guard.  \n \n19 In support of their cross-motion for summary judgment, Plaintiffs have submitted additional evidence \nand declarations, outside of the administrative record, including the redlined version of the Lesson \nPlan.  (See generally Exs. A–Q to Pls.’ Mot., ECF No. 36-3.)  Defendants have moved to strike these \ndocuments because, “[u]nder the APA, the district court’s review of merits issues must be based on the \nrecord the agency presents to the reviewing court.”  (Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Strike Evidence \nOutside of Admin. Record, ECF No. 52-1, at 3 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).)  \nDefendants’ argument is inapposite where, as here, the Court is evaluating the remedies for non-APA \nrelated claims, and Defendants make no argument as to why it would be inappropriate for the Court to \nrely on such evidence with respect to these INA claims.  Accordingly, Defendants’ motion to strike \nevidence outside of the administrative record will be DENIED.  \n90 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 94 of 99\nThe Court also finds it odd that USCIS argues both that a vacatur order would be \nsubstantially disruptive because it would create “a vacuum on guidance for any new \ndevelopments in immigration law since 2017” (id. at 8), and that the provisions that the \nCourt has found unlawful are discrete and severable, because the April 2019 version \n“has been included in several past iterations of the Lesson Plan” (id. at 11).  The former \nmerely underscores the non-severability finding that the agency contests.  And, if the \nlatter is the case, then responding to the vacatur should not be particularly onerous, for \nthe agency can rely on the allegedly substantially similar 2017 version of the Lesson \nPlan while it fashions relevant updates that are consistent with the law.   \nNor is this a case in which vacating the entire Lesson Plan would necessarily \ncreate confusion, see Chamber of Commerce v. S.E.C., 443 F.3d 890, 909 (D.C. Cir. \n2006) (staying a vacatur order on this ground), or deprive one or more parties of \nsignificant rights, see Bauer v. DeVos, 332 F. Supp. 3d 181, 185 (D.D.C. 2018).  The \ninstant detailed opinion explains why various provisions of the Lesson Plan violate the \nINA, and thus should be sufficient to guide the agency’s reconsideration and \npreparation of training materials that accurately describe the statutory and regulatory \nrequirements.  Furthermore, and importantly, the Court is ever mindful that, at bottom, \nthe process of revising the Lesson Plan to conform with the INA and its regulations is \nquintessentially the agency’s responsibility, and not this Court’s.  Cf. Regents, 140 S. \nCt. at 1914 (noting that making “difficult decision[s]” concerning policy matters is the \n“agency’s job”).  This means that it would be less than prudent under the circumstances \npresented in this case for the Court to undertake its own amendment process, by \nidentifying and striking only certain portions of the Lesson Plan; rather, given the \n91 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 95 of 99\nintegrated nature of the unlawful provisions and the lack of any indication that USCIS \nintended for any portion to be severable, the better course of action is for the Court to \nvacate the entire document, and thereby facilitate the agency’s own decisionmaking \nprocesses concerning the necessary revisions.  See, e.g., ACA Int’l v. F.C.C., 885 F.3d \n687, 708 (D.C. Cir. 2018). \n3.  Plaintiffs Are Entitled To New Credible Fear Determinations \nLastly, this Court has determined that vacatur of the Lesson Plan is not sufficient \nto redress Plaintiffs’ injuries fully, and that “specific injunctive relief” is necessary for \neach individual Plaintiff (Pls.’ Reply at 40), for several reasons.   \nFirst, the instant circumstances satisfy the familiar four-factor test for injunctive \nrelief.  See eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C., 547 U.S. 388, 391 (2006) (holding that a \ngrant of injunctive relief requires consideration of the plaintiff’s irreparable injury, the \nadequacy of the remedies available at law, the parties’ balance of hardships, and the \npublic interest).  Plaintiffs’ sworn declarations establish the potential for irreparable \ninjury, insofar as they detail the rapes, beatings, shootings, and family deaths that \nPlaintiffs experienced previously in their countries of origin and might experience again \nin the future if their asylum applications are not re-evaluated in accordance with the \nstandards that the law prescribes, and if they are removed pursuant to such procedurally \ndefective credible fear determinations.  (See Exs. B–G to Pls.’ Mot., ECF No. 36-3, at \n79–111.)  It is also sufficiently clear that, “without an injunction, the plaintiffs \npreviously removed will continue to live in fear every day, and the remaining plaintiffs \nare at risk of removal.”  Grace I, 344 F. Supp. 3d at 146, aff’d in relevant part, Grace \nII, 965 F.3d 883.  In other words, an order vacating the Lesson Plan and declaring it \n92 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 96 of 99\nunlawful would provide only partial relief to Julia and Sofia, who have already been \nremoved, and to Kiakombua, Ana, and Emma, who seemingly remain subject to \nunlawful removal orders.  The balance of the hardships favors injunctive relief for \nPlaintiffs’ benefit as well, because the government “cannot suffer harm from an \ninjunction that merely ends an unlawful practice[.]”  R.I.L-R v. Johnson, 80 F. Supp. 3d \n164, 191 (D.D.C. 2015) (quoting Rodriguez v. Robbins, 715 F.3d 1127, 1145 (9th Cir. \n2013)).  And the Supreme Court has further recognized that, although there is “a public \ninterest in prompt execution of removal orders[,]” there also “is a public interest in \npreventing aliens from being wrongfully removed, particularly to countries where they \nare likely to face substantial harm.”  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 436 (2009).  Thus, \nthis Court is satisfied that injunctive relief is proper. \nInjunctive relief is also warranted because, given the Court’s findings and \nconclusions regarding the unlawfulness of critical portions of the Lesson Plan and the \nneed for vacatur of the entire document, “there is ‘only one rational course’ for the \n[a]gency to follow upon remand[,]” Berge v. United States, 949 F. Supp. 2d 36, 43 \n(D.D.C. 2013) (quoting Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emps., AFL-CIO v. F.L.R.A., 778 F.2d 850, \n862 n.19 (D.C. Cir. 1985)), which is to void the credible fear determination that were \nmade with respect to each Plaintiff pursuant to the unlawful Lesson Plan, and to provide \nPlaintiffs with new credible fear determinations that do not apply the unlawful \nstandards in that document.  As noted above, Defendants’ argument that the Court lacks \nthe authority to issue any kind of injunctive relief (see Defs.’ Mot. at 65) relies on an \ninterpretation of the INA that has been rejected on numerous occasions, by all levels of \nthe federal judiciary.  See, e.g.,  R.I.L-R, 80 F. Supp. 3d at 184 (“[W]here a petitioner \n93 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 97 of 99\nseeks to enjoin conduct that allegedly is not even authorized by the statute, the court is \nnot enjoining the operation of the statute, and § 1252(f)(1) therefore is not implicated.” \n(internal alternations, quotation marks, and citations omitted)); see also Reno v. Am.-\nArab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 481 (1999) (noting that section 1252(f) \nonly “prohibits federal courts from granting classwide injunctive relief against the \noperation of §§ 1221–1231”); Grace II, 965 F.3d at 907 (explaining that section \n1252(f)(1) “places no restriction on the district court’s authority to enjoin agency action \nfound to be unlawful”).  Thus, nothing in the INA prevents this Court from enjoining \nthe agency to take certain actions to remedy prior unlawful agency conduct.   \nNotably, returning Plaintiffs Julia and Sofia (who have already been removed) to \nthe status quo ante means that Defendants will have to facilitate the return of these \nPlaintiffs back to the United States, at no cost to Plaintiffs Julia and Sofia.  See, e.g., \nGrace I, 344 F. Supp. 3d at 144 (holding that the Court has the authority to order the \nreturn of plaintiffs unlawfully removed, and doing so), aff’d in relevant part, Grace II, \n965 F.3d at 909.  Consistent with this Court’s Order, these Plaintiffs must be afforded \nevery opportunity to meet with a properly trained USCIS asylum officer, and they must \nbe interviewed in accordance with the standards and requirements of the INA and its \nimplementing regulations.  And they must not be made to fear the burden of having to \nfind the means of making the journey back to the United States border, or having to \nincur the financial costs involved.  Cf. Order, Grace v. Whitaker, No. 18-cv-01853, ECF \nNo. 105, at 3 (Dec. 19, 2018) (ordering “defendants to bring back into the United \nStates, at no expense to plaintiffs, any plaintiff who has been removed pursuant to an \nexpedited removal order prior to this Order”).  \n94 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 98 of 99\nWith respect to Plaintiffs Kiakombua, Ana, and Emma, Defendants might opt to \nconfirm (through the issuance of proper Notices to Appear) that these Plaintiffs have \nalready cleared the credible fear hurdle, in lieu of providing new credible fear \nscreenings.  However, if the agency determines that new credible fear interviews are \nrequired, these Plaintiffs’ evaluations, too, must be fully consistent with the INA and its \nregulations, and thus must not rely in any way upon the now invalidated Lesson Plan or \nany of its unlawful provisions.  Only if each Plaintiff’s circumstances are assessed anew \npursuant to, and consistent with, all applicable statutory and regulatory requirements \nconcerning the credible fear stage of the asylum application process will this Court’s \norder enjoining Defendants to provide new credible fear determinations for Plaintiffs be \nsatisfied.    \nV.  CONCLUSION \nThe INA and the regulations that federal agencies have promulgated to govern \nthe modern asylum application process plainly reflect “the historic policy of the United \nStates to respond to the urgent needs of persons subject to persecution in their \nhomelands[.]”  8 U.S.C. § 1521 note.  One manifestation of this policy is the statute’s \ntwo-stage process for evaluating asylum eligibility in the expedited removal context, \nwhich includes an initial screening assessment of whether prospective asylum \napplicants have a credible fear of persecution in their home countries.  The credible fear \nevaluation is meant to be a “low bar” for the noncitizen, insofar as the interviewing \nofficer need only determine that there is a significant possibility that the applicant \nwould be eligible for asylum.  Thuraissigiam, 140 S. Ct. at 1965–67.  Yet, as explained \nin this Memorandum Opinion, USCIS’s amended “Lesson Plan on Credible Fear of \n95 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 84   Filed 10/31/20   Page 99 of 99\nPersecution or Torture” imports into the credible fear evaluation various standards and \nburdens that apply only to the second stage of the statutory scheme, and places burdens \non credible fear interviewees that extend far beyond the reasonable boundaries of \nCongress’s policy choices as reflected in the governing law.  Thus, the Lesson Plan \nqualifies as a written directive, guideline, or procedure that implements the expedited \nremoval scheme in a manner that unlawfully diverges from the INA and its \nimplementing regulations.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(A)(ii). \nAs a result, this Court concludes that the parts of the Lesson Plan that conflict \nwith the INA and related regulations—identified in Section IV.C, supra—must be \nDECLARED UNLAWFUL.  Furthermore, because the unlawful parts are not severable \nfrom the remainder of the document, the Lesson Plan must be VACATED in its \nentirety, and the matter remanded to the agency for further consideration in light of this \nCourt’s opinion.  In addition, as detailed in the accompanying Order, Defendants will \nbe ENJOINED to void the credible fear determinations that were previously made with \nrespect to each Plaintiff and to provide each Plaintiff with a new credible fear screening \nthat does not rely in any respect on the unlawful policies in the vacated Lesson Plan. \n \nDATE: October 31, 2020      Ketanji Brown Jackson \nKETANJI BROWN JACKSON \nUnited States District Judge \n96 \n ",

This is a case about upholding the American commitment to treat fairly the asylum \nclaims of people who arrive at our borders fleeing persecution and violence.  In yet another attempt \nto circumvent this codified and consistently reified commitment, on April 30, 2019 the Trump \nAdministration issued a new set of instructions (the “Lesson Plan”) to the hundreds of asylum \nofficers who have the life-and-death responsibility of screening out those baseless claims for \nhumanitarian protection from the rest.  Rather than making a good-faith effort to administer the \nsystem Congress designed, the Administration issued a biased, error-filled set of instructions \ndesigned to turn back as many asylum seekers as possible, in violation of the Immigration and \nNationality  Act  (“INA”),  the  Refugee  Act,  the  Convention  Against  Torture  (“CAT”),  the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”), and the Constitution.  Plaintiffs therefore seek to have it \nvacated and enjoined. \n2.  The United States has long been committed to providing refuge to those fleeing \nviolence and persecution, and Congress codified that commitment in the Refugee Act of 1980, \nwhich declares it to be “the historic policy of the United States to respond to the urgent needs of \npersons subject to persecution in their homelands.”  Refugee Act of 1980, § 101(a), Pub. L. No. \n96-212, 94 Stat. 102. \n3.  Even in amending the INA in 1996 to permit immigration officers to summarily \nexpel certain noncitizens from the United States on an expedited basis, Congress was careful to \nhonor our country’s historic commitment to those seeking safe harbor by creating a screening \nprocess to ensure that anyone who might be eligible for asylum or related forms of humanitarian \nprotection would avoid expedited removal and have full access to the immigration and federal \ncourt systems to make their claims.  This “credible fear” assessment was deliberately designed to \n2 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 6   Filed 06/28/19   Page 4 of 28\nbe a permissive standard to safeguard against the United States returning displaced people to \ndangerous conditions they fled, because doing so contravenes international and domestic law \nobligations. \n4.  Since  taking  office,  however,  President  Trump  and  his  Administration  have \npursued an explicitly nativist agenda of closing the borders to asylum seekers without regard to \nour national commitments, including those enshrined in law.  \n5.  Most relevant to this case, the Administration has expressly adopted the goal of \ndramatically reducing the rate at which asylum seekers pass the initial, threshold “credible fear” \nscreening step—the only avenue through which they can apply for humanitarian protection—so as \nto facilitate their expeditious return to the violence and persecution they fled. \n6.  In furtherance of the Administration’s goal of turning away more asylum seekers, \nDefendants  issued  the  Lesson  Plan  to  the  hundreds  of  asylum  officers  who  conduct  these \nscreenings.  The Lesson Plan instructs the officers in a manner that is contrary to the governing \nstatutes and regulations and substantially—and unlawfully—narrows access to the immigration \nand federal court systems.   \n7.  Among  other  things,  the  Lesson  Plan  improperly  raises  the  asylum  seeker’s \nevidentiary burden; shifts to asylum seekers burdens actually borne by the government; and \nconverts what is supposed to be a nonadversarial, threshold screening into a biased and adversarial \nhearing through which asylum officers are to apply erroneous legal standards to decide ultimate \nissues that are supposed to await adjudication by the immigration courts.  \n8.  Plaintiffs are five asylum seekers who have been deported or are at imminent risk \nof deportation because of the Lesson Plan issued on April 30, 2019.  Fleeing death threats, rape, \nbeatings, and arbitrary detention, among other forms of persecution, they reached the U.S. border \n3 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 6   Filed 06/28/19   Page 5 of 28\nand sought asylum, but were denied the opportunity to apply for protection when asylum officers \nfound they lacked a “credible fear” under the Lesson Plan.   \n9.  Plaintiffs seek a declaration that the Lesson Plan violates the INA, the Refugee Act, \nthe CAT, the APA, and the Due Process Clause; an order enjoining this unlawful directive so that \nthey and others may have a fair opportunity to present their claims for humanitarian relief through \nthe system Congress created; and an order vacating their expedited removal orders and requiring \nthat they be provided, at a minimum, with new credible fear screenings under the proper legal \nstandard.  Those Plaintiffs who have not yet been removed—Ana and Emma—additionally seek a \nstay of their expedited removal.  \n10.  Absent relief from this Court, Plaintiffs and thousands more who, like them, are \ndesperately seeking safety will be unlawfully deported and condemned to their countries of origin \nto face rape, beatings, and other forms of persecution and torture, including death. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n11.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3), which \npermits review in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia of “a written policy \ndirective, written policy guideline, or written procedure” implementing the expedited removal \nstatute.  The Lesson Plan issued on April 30, 2019 is “a written policy directive, written policy \nguideline, or written procedure” implementing the expedited removal statute.  This Court also has \nsubject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331. \n12.  Venue is proper in this District because 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3) requires actions \nbrought thereunder to be filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  See \nalso 5 U.S.C. § 703.  Venue is also proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1) because, on \n4 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 6   Filed 06/28/19   Page 6 of 28\ninformation and belief, a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the Complaint \noccurred within the District of Columbia. \nTHE PARTIES \n13.  Plaintiff Maria M. Kiakombua is a citizen of Angola detained in the custody of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security at the T. Don Hutto Residential Center in Taylor, Texas.  She \nwas forced to flee Angola because of harm she faced and feared would continue at the hands of \nher boyfriend, who is in the military, and other government officials.  Over the course of two years, \nMs. Kiakombua’s boyfriend beat her, sometimes with a machete, and threatened to kill her if she \nleft him.  Ms. Kiakombua was hospitalized at least once because of the injuries she suffered.  In \naddition, on more than one occasion, government officials associated with Ms. Kiakombua’s \nboyfriend came to her home and raped her in the presence of her children, due in part to her failure \nto abide by societal norms regarding the proper role and behavior of women.  They also beat her \nchildren and broke her son’s arm.  After fleeing Angola, Ms. Kiakombua came to the United States \nseeking protection in April 2019.  \n14.  In May 2019, an asylum officer determined—pursuant to a credible fear process \ngoverned by the unlawful standards and procedures contained in the Lesson Plan, and after an \ninterview that lasted only one hour, including interpretation—that Ms. Kiakombua lacked a \ncredible fear of persecution or torture.  An immigration judge subsequently agreed.   \n15.  On June 6, 2019, and with the assistance of pro bono immigration consultant \nprovided by the non-profit American Gateways, Ms. Kiakombua filed a request for reconsideration \nof the asylum officer’s negative credible fear determination with the Houston Asylum Office of \nUnited States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”).   \n5 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 6   Filed 06/28/19   Page 7 of 28\n16.  In response to that request for reconsideration, Ms. Kiakombua was interviewed by \nan asylum officer a second time, on June 13, 2019.  The Director of the Houston Asylum Office \ndenied her request for reconsideration via a letter emailed to American Gateways later that same \nday.  Ms. Kiakombua suffered significant emotional distress related to the credible fear process \nand her then-impending removal. \n17.  Ms. Kiakombua filed the instant suit on June 25, 2019.  See Compl., ECF No. 1. \n18.  On June 26, 2019, Ms. Kiakombua’s undersigned counsel spoke with counsel for \nthe government via telephone and email.  Ms. Kiakombua’s counsel provided the government Ms. \nKiakombua’s name and alien number, and a copy of the complaint, and requested that Defendants \nvoluntarily agree to stay Ms. Kiakombua’s expedited removal, to obviate the need for Ms. \nKiakombua to request that relief from the Court.   \n19.  The following day, the Director of the Houston Asylum Office emailed American \nGateways a letter stating that USCIS had sua sponte reconsidered its prior denial of her June 6, \n2019 request for reconsideration, and had found that Ms. Kiakombua has a credible fear.  \n20.  Plaintiff Ana*1is a citizen of El Salvador detained in the custody of the Department \nof Homeland Security at the Karnes County Residential Center in Karnes City, Texas.  She was \nforced to flee El Salvador after receiving death threats from gang members who targeted her \nhusband, a landowner, and his family.  In addition to sending death threats to her, the gang \nmembers threatened several other family members and shot her husband and her nine-year-old \ngranddaughter, although both survived.  Though the family reported the shooting and death threats \nto the police, the police were of little assistance.  After fleeing El Salvador, Ana came to the United \nStates seeking protection in May 2019.  \n                                                 \n∗ Plaintiffs seeking leave to proceed under a pseudonym are indicated with an asterisk. \n6 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 6   Filed 06/28/19   Page 8 of 28\n21.  In June 2019, an asylum officer determined—pursuant to a credible fear process \ngoverned by the unlawful standards and procedures contained in the Lesson Plan, and after an \ninterview that lasted under two hours, including interpretation—that Ana lacked a credible fear of \npersecution or torture.  An immigration judge subsequently agreed.  Ana is now at imminent risk \nof removal to El Salvador. \n22.  Plaintiff  Emma*  is  a  citizen  of  El  Salvador  detained  in  the  custody  of  the \nDepartment of Homeland Security at the Karnes County Residential Center in Karnes City, Texas.  \nIn El Salvador, she was threatened and emotionally and physically abused by the father of her \ndaughter.  He attempted to control her and treated her as if she were his property.  She was also \nbeaten and sexually abused by her brother.  Emma did not report any of this abuse to the police \nbecause she knew from experience and reputation that the police would not help.  She was \nespecially reluctant to report her daughter’s father because he has close associations with the \npolice.  On at least one occasion, one of those police officer associates threatened to detain her and \nto take away her daughter because she supposedly spoke to him in too aggressive a manner.  Emma \nfled El Salvador fearing for her life and came to the United States seeking protection in May 2019. \n23.  In June 2019, an asylum officer determined—pursuant to a credible fear process \ngoverned by the unlawful standards and procedures contained in the Lesson Plan, and after an \ninterview that lasted under two hours, including interpretation—that Emma lacked a credible fear \nof persecution or torture.  She is awaiting her hearing with an immigration judge, who will review \nthe negative decision issued by the asylum officer.  She is at risk of soon being removed to El \nSalvador. \n24.  Plaintiff Sofia* is a citizen of Cuba.  Sofia is married to U.S. lawful permanent \nresident.  A medical doctor who opposes Cuba’s ruling party, she has made her views known \n7 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 6   Filed 06/28/19   Page 9 of 28\nthrough her political positions and refusal to acquiesce in demands of government officials.  In \nresponse, the government has accused her of being anti-revolutionary and subjected her to \nsurveillance, threats, and detention.  The fear and stress Sofia experienced as a result of the Cuban \ngovernment’s actions led her to miscarry a pregnancy and ultimately to decide to flee to the United \nStates immediately, rather than risk waiting in Cuba until her husband’s petition was processed.  \nShe came to the United States seeking protection in April 2019. \n25.  In May 2019, an asylum officer determined—pursuant to a credible fear process \ngoverned by the unlawful standards and procedures contained in the Lesson Plan, and after an \ninterview that lasted under ninety minutes, including interpretation—that Sofia lacked a credible \nfear  of  persecution  or  torture.    An  immigration  judge  subsequently  agreed.    Sofia  sought \nreconsideration from the asylum officer, but that, too, was denied.  Shortly thereafter, she was \ndeported to Cuba, where she has been questioned by the authorities about why she fled.  She lives \nin constant fear of further governmental threats and harassment. \n26.  Plaintiff Julia* is a citizen of El Salvador.  She fled El Salvador after witnessing \nthe murder of a neighbor committed by gang members.  On multiple occasions following the \nmurder, the gang threatened to kill her if she reported their crime to the police.  Julia came to the \nUnited States seeking protection in April 2019. \n27.  In May 2019, an asylum officer determined—pursuant to a credible fear process \ngoverned by the unlawful standards and procedures contained in the Lesson Plan, and after an \ninterview that lasted under two hours, including interpretation—that Julia lacked a credible fear of \npersecution or torture.  An immigration judge subsequently agreed.  Julia was removed to El \nSalvador shortly thereafter. \n8 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 6   Filed 06/28/19   Page 10 of 28\n28.

Congress has enshrined in U.S. law special protections for individuals fleeing \npersecution or torture, consistent with the humanitarian commitments of the United States under \ntreaties including the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees and the Convention Against \nTorture. \n33.  In enacting the Refugee Act in 1980, Congress “declare[d]” that the Act’s purpose \nwas to codify “the historic policy of the United States to respond to the urgent needs of persons \nsubject to persecution in their homelands.”  § 101(a), 94 Stat. 102. \n34.  Consistent with that historic commitment, all noncitizens at or within U.S. borders \ngenerally have a right to apply for asylum—a form of protection available to individuals who can \nprove that they are “refugee[s]” within the meaning of the INA for having suffered persecution in \nthe past or having a “well-founded fear” of persecution in the future. \n35.  Other provisions of U.S. law prohibit the government from removing noncitizens \nto countries where they face persecution or torture, even if they are not granted asylum.  See 8 \nU.S.C. § 1231(b)(3); Convention Against Torture, Art. 3; 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(c), (d).  Rather, when \nappropriate, the government must grant the noncitizens protection in the form of withholding of \nremoval under the INA, see 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), or withholding or deferral of removal under \nthe CAT, see 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(c)(4). \n36.  The  principle  of  non-refoulement  reflected  in  these  Executive  and  legislative \ncommitments, moreover, is also a part of customary international law, which likewise provides for \nthe right to seek and receive asylum, mandates a fair process for determination of protection \nclaims, and prohibits torture and cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment. \n10 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 6   Filed 06/28/19   Page 12 of 28\nExpedited Removal and the Credible Fear Screening Safeguard \n37.  Before 1997, any noncitizen that the federal government wished to remove from \nthe United States generally was entitled to a full hearing before an immigration judge, with \nopportunities to challenge the alleged grounds for her removal and to apply for relief from removal, \nincluding asylum. \n38.  With the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, \nwhich went into effect in 1997, Congress created an expedited removal system through which \nimmigration officers outside the judicial system may order removed certain noncitizens without \nproviding them an opportunity to apply for relief from removal, and “without further hearing or \nreview.”  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i); see also id. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(I). \n39.  Reflecting our country’s commitment to asylum seekers, however, and to avoid the \npossibility of unlawfully and inhumanely sending individuals back to persecution, Congress took \ncare to ensure that any noncitizen who “indicate[d] either an intention to apply for asylum under \n[8 U.S.C. § 1158] or a fear of persecution” would be accorded some process before they could be \nremoved—including, potentially, a full hearing before an immigration judge and subsequent \nreview  by  the  Board  of  Immigration  Appeals  and  federal  appellate  courts.  8  U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(A)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(f).   \n40.  Thus, if noncitizens in the expedited removal system indicate that they intend to \napply for asylum or fear persecution, immigration officers are required to refer them for interviews \nbefore asylum officers to determine if they have a “credible fear of persecution.”  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii); see also id. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(ii).  Throughout the credible fear screening \nprocess, the asylum seekers are subject to mandatory detention.  Id. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(IV).  \nAsylum seekers have a right to consultation, but not representation, during credible fear interviews. \nId. § 1225(b)(2)(B)(iv). \n11 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 6   Filed 06/28/19   Page 13 of 28\n41.  If an asylum officer determines that an asylum seeker has a “credible fear of \npersecution,” the officer must refer the case to immigration court for a full hearing on whether the \nindividual is subject to removal in the first place and, if so, whether the asylum seeker is eligible \nfor protection such as asylum.  If, after the hearing and any appeals, the asylum seeker is found to \nbe  removable  and  ineligible  for  protection,  he  or  she  is  ordered  removed.    See  8  U.S.C. \n§1225(b)(1)(B)(ii); 8 U.S.C. § 1229a; 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(f). \n42.  Since the adoption in 1999 of regulations implementing the Convention Against \nTorture—which bars the government from removing noncitizens to countries where they will be \ntortured—the credible fear safeguard has applied also to those who indicate a fear of torture and \nare deemed to have a “credible fear of torture.”  8 C.F.R. § 208.30(e), (f). \n43.  When asylum officers determine that asylum seekers do not have a credible fear of \npersecution or torture, they are ordered removed “without further hearing or review.”  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(I).   \n44.  At this stage, asylum seekers may request review by an immigration judge, but the \njudge’s review is limited to assessing the credible fear determination, and is based on the record \ndeveloped and relied on by the asylum officer.  See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.30(g)(2).  If the immigration \njudge affirms—which is typically done through a checkbox form, with no explanation—the \nindividuals are removed.  With few exceptions, there is no statutory or regulatory right to further \nreview  of  this  crucial  gatekeeping  function.  See  8  U.S.C.  § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii);  8  C.F.R. \n§ 1208.30(g)(2)(iv)(A), (B). \n12 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 6   Filed 06/28/19   Page 14 of 28\nConduct of Credible Fear Screenings \n45.  Congress designed the credible fear standard to enable asylum officers to quickly \nscreen out frivolous asylum claims while permitting those that are potentially meritorious to be \nadjudicated by immigration judges. \n46.  In doing so, Congress created what the Department of Justice has recognized as a \n“low threshold of proof of potential entitlement to asylum,” 62 Fed. Reg. 10,312, 10,320 (Mar. 6, \n1997).  As provided in the governing statute, “the term ‘credible fear of persecution’ means that \nthere is a significant possibility, taking into account the credibility of the statements made by the \nalien in support of the alien’s claim and such other facts as are known to the officer, that the alien \ncould establish eligibility for asylum under [8 U.S.C. § 1158].”  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v) \n(emphases added); see also 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(e) (same). \n47.  Reflecting its purpose and the circumstances of those who have just arrived at our \nborders fleeing violence and other forms of persecution, the interview must be conducted “in a \nnonadversarial  manner,”  with  the  asylum  officer  required  “to  elicit  all  relevant  and  useful \ninformation bearing on whether the applicant has a credible fear of persecution or torture.”  8 \nC.F.R. § 208.30(d).   \n48.  Asylum  officers  must  receive  special  training  in  “international  human  rights \nlaw, nonadversarial interview techniques, and other relevant national and international refugee \nlaws and principles.”  8 C.F.R. § 208.1(b). \n49.  At the credible fear stage, the asylum officer’s mandate is not to adjudicate the \nclaim  (or  any  part  thereof)  on  the  merits,  but  rather  to  determine—on  information  that  is \ncircumscribed both by statute and by practical considerations—whether the asylum seeker might \nestablish eligibility for asylum if given that opportunity through formal removal proceedings.  \n13 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 6   Filed 06/28/19   Page 15 of 28\n50.  There is no statutory or regulatory requirement that asylum seekers produce any \nevidence beyond their own testimony at the credible fear stage.  \n51.  Nor is the credible fear stage suited to complex factfinding.  Asylum seekers \ntypically are recent arrivals with little to no knowledge of U.S. immigration law, scant opportunity \nto marshal relevant evidence and even to identify pertinent information, and limited access, if any, \nto counsel. Many are struggling with the trauma associated with persecution in their home \ncountries and their flight to the United States, as well as trauma and stress associated with their \ndetention by U.S. immigration officials.  The screening, furthermore, is required by law to be \nnonadversarial.  The asylum officer who makes the determination as to credible fear need not be \nan attorney.   \n52.  As a formal matter, the credible fear screening is not considered to be part of the \napplication for asylum, which can be filed as late as a year after the asylum seeker’s arrival (or \neven later in certain circumstances).   \n53.  Negative credible fear determinations nonetheless remain a part of the procedural \nhistories of the cases in which they are issued.   \n54.  Even if later vacated, a negative credible fear determination by an asylum officer \ncan make it more difficult for the asylum seeker to ultimately be found eligible for or be granted \nrelief from removal.   \n55.  Even after an asylum seeker has been served a notice to appear and placed in formal \nremoval proceedings under 8 U.S.C. § 1229a, the government can return the asylum seeker to the \nexpedited removal process.    \n14 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 6   Filed 06/28/19   Page 16 of 28\nDefendants’ Policy to Drive Down the Credible Fear Passage Rate \n56.  As a candidate, President Trump ran an explicitly nativist campaign that demonized \nimmigrants and refugees, particularly those who are not (or are not perceived as) white.   \n57.  Since taking office, President Trump has acted on his nativist promises, making \nunprecedented policy changes to advance his agenda without any regard for the law or the \ndevastating impact that they would have on the lives of those who come to the United States \nseeking refuge.  \n58.  For example, almost immediately upon taking office, President Trump ended the \nCentral American Minors (“CAM”) program.  Under that program, minor children in the Northern \nTriangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras with parents lawfully present in the \nUnited States could apply in their home country to be considered for refugee status, which \notherwise required them to make the perilous overland journey to the United States’ southern \nborder.  When President Trump took office, approximately 2,700 children had been conditionally \napproved for humanitarian parole through the program, and were set to be safely reunited with \ntheir parents lawfully present here.  Following the shutdown of the program—which was first done \nin secret, and then publicly announced some eight months later—those conditional approvals were \nrescinded, en masse, in a decision that was later held unlawful and enjoined.  S.A. v. Trump, No. \n18-cv-03539-LB, 2019 WL 990680 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 1, 2019) (preliminary injunction decision); \nsee also S.A. v. Trump, No. 18-cv-03539-LB, 2019 WL 1593229 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 12, 2019) \n(agreement regarding permanent injunction). \n59.  The next summer, the Trump Administration implemented a widely criticized \npolicy of forcibly separating migrant parents from their children.  Administration officials have \nadmitted that the goal of the separation was to discourage Central American families from \ntraveling to the border and applying for asylum.  The separation policy was challenged as unlawful, \n15 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 6   Filed 06/28/19   Page 17 of 28\nand a federal judge granted a classwide preliminary injunction.  Ms. L v. U.S. Immigration & \nCustoms Enf’t, 310 F. Supp. 3d 1133 (S.D. Cal. 2018).  The Trump Administration estimates it \ncould take it two more years just to identify thousands of migrant families that it forcibly separated, \nand even longer to reunify them. \n60.  Likewise, in November 2018, the Trump Administration sought to render ineligible \nfor asylum noncitizens who entered the United States outside of a port of entry, in defiance of \nstatutory  language  explicitly  making  such  individuals  eligible.    That  policy,  too,  has  been \npreliminarily enjoined.  East Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, 354 F. Supp. 3d 1094 (N.D. Cal. \n2018), stay pending appeal denied, 909 F.3d 1219 (9th Cir. 2018), 139 S. Ct. 782 (2018). \n61.  Most relevant to this case, the Trump Administration has also sought to make it \nmore difficult for those from Central America to pass credible fear screenings and to apply for \nasylum.  These changes were enjoined by a court in this district in Grace v. Whitaker, 344 F. Supp. \n3d 96 (D.D.C. 2018), appeal docketed, No. 19-5013 (D.C. Cir.). \n62.  As well as through these policies that have already been enjoined by courts, \nPresident Trump has made clear through his words—including materially false and misleading \nstatements about the immigration system—his intent to destroy the asylum system and the credible \nfear process that Congress mandated.   \n63.  The President has personally directed blatantly illegal actions targeting asylum \nseekers.  \n64.  In March 2019, President Trump ordered then-Secretary of Homeland Security \nKirstjen Nielsen to close the El Paso port of entry and at the very least to deny entry to asylum \nseekers; Secretary Nielsen refused, and shortly thereafter was forced to resign.  \n16 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 6   Filed 06/28/19   Page 18 of 28\n65.  Similarly, in a visit to the United States’ southern border in April 2019, President \nTrump personally directed Border Patrol agents to turn asylum seekers away and to explain to any \njudge finding fault with that action, “Sorry, judge, I can’t do it. We don’t have the room.” \n66.  By then, the Administration had already, in fact, adopted policies that have the \npurpose and effect of turning away asylum seekers, including through its “metering” program, \nunder which the only way many asylum seekers can exercise their statutory right to request asylum \nis to cross the border illegally, between ports of entry, and to surrender themselves to the first \nBorder Patrol agent they can find.   \n67.  In recent months, a number of asylum seekers, including children, have died \nattempting to apply for asylum by crossing between ports of entry, as the conditions are frequently \ntreacherous.  Several asylum seekers have died attempting to cross rivers.  Others have died trying \nto cross the desert. \n68.  Members of the Administration have shown little remorse when confronted with \nthe awful consequences of their policies.  The President has attempted to shift blame to the victims, \nrepeatedly denigrating asylum seekers without any factual basis, suggesting that they are lying, \n“invading” fraudsters who are “not afraid of anything,” and dehumanizing them to the point of \ncomparing them to animals.  In May 2018, President Trump said of people crossing the Mexican \nborder into the United States: “You wouldn’t believe how bad these people are. These aren’t \npeople. These are animals.”  \n69.  The President has repeatedly opined that the entire asylum system is fraudulent, \nignoring that it is a system created by Congress in compliance with the United States’ international \nobligations.  In April 2019, President Trump repeatedly called the asylum system “a big, fat con \njob.”  Furthermore, just before filing of this suit, President Trump threatened massive immigration \n17 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 6   Filed 06/28/19   Page 19 of 28\nraids across the country targeting women and children if Democrats did not work together with \nRepublicans to find a solution to the “loophole” of migrants fleeing persecution having the right \nto ask for asylum in this country. \n70.  The Executive agencies under the President have also participated in disseminating \nfalse information about the asylum system. This spring, the Executive Office for Immigration \nReview issued a “fact” sheet that, among other things, dismissed as a “myth” the notion that \n“[m]ost aliens who claim a credible fear of persecution have meritorious asylum claims.”  In \nresponse to the “fact” sheet, the National Association of Immigration Judges issued a press release \ndeclaring the document to be “filled with errors and misinformation.”   \n71.  Similarly, a group of retired immigration judges and retired members of the Board \nof  Immigration  Appeals  wrote  an  open  letter  to  the  Director  of  the  Executive  Office  for \nImmigration Review that condemned the “fact” sheet as “political pandering, at the expense of \npublic faith in the immigration courts,” for presenting “imagined ‘myths’ and wildly inaccurate \nand misleading information labeled as ‘fact.’”  True “American courts,” they cautioned, “do not \nissue propaganda implying that those whose cases [they] rule[] on for the most part have invalid \nclaims[,] . . . or that those unable to surmount the government-created obstacles to filing asylum \napplications are somehow guilty of deceit.”  “Such statements,” they continued, “indicate a bias \nwhich is absolutely unacceptable and, frankly, shocking.” \n72.  With recent changes in Administration staff, Defendants have renewed their focus \non credible fear screenings, making it a priority to drive down the rate at which asylum seekers \npass the screenings and avoid summary deportation.   \n18 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 6   Filed 06/28/19   Page 20 of 28\n73.  Indeed, Defendant McAleenan and Defendant Cuccinelli were recently tapped to \nlead DHS and USCIS, respectively, for their willingness to take more aggressive stances than their \npredecessors to restrict applications for humanitarian relief.   \n74.  Shortly after assuming his role, Defendant Cuccinelli admonished USCIS staff to \ndo “[their] part to help stem the crisis and better secure the homeland” when conducting credible \nfear screenings.  His message was considered by many who received it to be a thinly veiled threat \nthat asylum officers would be blamed for the Administration’s failings if the credible fear passage \nrate did not materially drop.   \n75.  In a further effort to lower the credible fear passage rate, Defendants have also \nbegun recruiting CBP officers, who are expected to be more “aggressive” with asylum seekers at \nthe border, to conduct credible fear screenings. \n76.  On April 9, 2019, a senior Administration official reported that the Administration \nwould be implementing policy changes to make it more difficult for those asserting a fear of \npersecution or torture to access the U.S. immigration and federal court systems.  Regarding \ncredible fear screenings, the official said that asylum officers would “apply greater rigor and \nscrutiny to . . . [asylum] claims,” and suggested that DHS might mobilize assistance from the \nDepartment of State in order to further drive down the credible fear passage rate. \nThe Lesson Plan \n77.  On April 30, 2019, the USCIS RAIO Directorate issued a final written “Lesson \nPlan” on “Credible Fear of Persecution and Torture Determinations.”  Shortly thereafter, Reuters \npublished the Lesson Plan, a true and accurate copy of which is attached as Exhibit A. \n78.  The Lesson Plan is a policy document that controls the conduct of asylum officers \nin the credible fear process.   \n19 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 6   Filed 06/28/19   Page 21 of 28\n79.  When promulgating regulations on the expedited removal process, the Department \nof Justice declined to elaborate on the credible fear standard, reasoning that asylum officer \ntraining—founded on documents like the Lesson Plan—would be “extensive” in order to control \nhow the credible fear standard was “applied to particular cases” and to “ensure that the standard \n[wa]s implemented in a way which w[ould] encourage flexibility and a broad application of the \nstatutory standard,” consistent with Congress’ aim.  62 Fed. Reg. 10,312, 10,317 (Mar. 6, 1997). \n80.  Here, however, the Lesson Plan executes Defendants’ policy to drive down the \ncredible fear passage rate by directing asylum officers to conduct interviews in a manner that is \ncontrary  to  the  statutory  scheme,  binding  regulations,  judicial  precedent,  and  longstanding \npractice.  It does so in myriad ways. \n81.  For example, the Lesson Plan effectively converts the credible fear determination \nfrom an inquiry into whether an asylum seeker could establish eligibility for relief in the future \ninto an adjudication on whether the asylum seeker actually has established eligibility.   \n82.  Throughout the Lesson Plan, Defendants suggest that the asylum seeker’s ability to \nsucceed on a credible fear determination will hinge on her ability to fully establish eligibility for \nrelief in all of its intricacies.  Among other things, the Lesson Plan: \na.  requires the asylum seeker to identify specific facts sufficient to establish eligibility for \nasylum in order to be found to have a credible fear, even if such facts are not and would \nnot be expected to be within the asylum seeker’s knowledge; \nb.  requires the asylum seeker to establish “a significant possibility of future persecution,” \nwhen the credible fear standard merely requires a significant possibility of establishing \neligibility, and even the substantive asylum standard requires only a “well-founded fear \nof persecution,” for which the Supreme Court has held a 1 in 10 chance of future \npersecution is sufficient; and \nc.  otherwise misrepresents the relevant asylum standards by failing to present them \naccording to the controlling question of whether the asylum seeker has a significant \npossibility of meeting those standards in the future. \n20 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 6   Filed 06/28/19   Page 22 of 28\n83.  The Lesson Plan also increases the evidentiary burden the asylum seeker must carry \nto pass a credible fear screening by, among other things, imposing an unlawful corroboration \nrequirement;  requiring  the  asylum  seeker  to  present  “more  than  ‘significant  evidence’”  of \neligibility, contrary to the applicable standard; unlawfully prohibiting asylum officers from making \nallowances  for  special  circumstances—such  as  trauma,  the  passage  of  time,  or  cultural \nconsiderations—that may make it difficult for the asylum seeker to present her story in the setting \nof the credible fear screening; and placing the onus on the asylum seeker to produce testimony that \nis in fact the officer’s duty to elicit. \n84.  Relatedly, the Lesson Plan turns what the law requires to be a nonadversarial \ninterview into an adversarial process that is biased against the asylum seeker, with the asylum \nofficer functioning at once as opponent and arbiter.  Among other things, the Lesson Plan: \na.  requires—in contravention of binding regulations—asylum officers to measure the \nasylum seeker’s statements against information in Department of State-issued \nreports  that  the  current  Administration  recently  revised  to  remove  accurate \ninformation helpful to asylum seekers, and to treat the reports as “objective” fact; \nb.  instructs asylum officers—in contravention of law—that they need not provide the \nasylum seeker with an opportunity to address concerns that might lead to a negative \ncredibility determination; and \nc.  encourages asylum officers to find ways to use prior statements to Border Patrol to \nimpeach the asylum seeker. \n85.  In addition, the Lesson Plan misrepresents the substantive law to be considered by \nthe asylum officer to evaluate potential eligibility for asylum or other humanitarian protection, and \nin ways that prejudice applicants.  For example, the Lesson Plan: \na.  doubles down on an erroneous construction of private actor persecution that was \nenjoined by  Grace v. Whitaker, 344 F. Supp. 3d 96, 107 (D.D.C. 2018), by \ninstructing that “the government [in the asylum seeker’s country of origin] must \nhave abdicated its responsibility to control persecution” for harm due to actions of \na private actor to constitute persecution; \n21 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 6   Filed 06/28/19   Page 23 of 28\nb.  mischaracterizes controlling Supreme Court and other case law so that asylum \nofficers will determine that no credible fear exists, when a faithful application of \nthe law would (or at the very least could) lead to the opposite result; \nc.  directs asylum officers to make negative credible fear determinations based on what \nare actually discretionary factors, not eligibility criteria, such as when there is a \nsignificant possibility that the asylum seeker could establish past persecution; and \nd.  as to discretionary factors related to past persecution and so-called “humanitarian \nasylum” that are improper to consider at the credible fear stage in the first place, \nmischaracterizes the respective burdens on the government and the asylum seeker. \n86.  In still other ways, the Lesson Plan is simply irrational.  For example, it requires \nasylum officers to specify the bases for a positive credibility finding, but not for a negative one.  \nAnd in a series of footnotes, it creates a complicated set of conditional instructions that are \ntriggered “[i]f the order in Grace v. Whitaker, 344 F. Supp. 3d 96 (D.D.C. 2018), is lifted,” without \nexplaining what would qualify as that order being “lifted,” and with seemingly no regard for the \nlikelihood that these instructions would cause confusion if they were ever even arguably triggered. \n87.  The Lesson Plan is problematic as well for what it omits from previous guidance, \nwithout explanation or even acknowledgment.  For example, the Lesson Plan omits the regulation-\nbased instruction that “novel or unique issues . . . merit consideration in a full hearing before an \nimmigration  judge”  even  if  a  negative  credible  fear  determination  might  otherwise  seem \nwarranted, 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(e)(4); omits instruction in other applicable law and procedure that is \nhelpful  to  the  asylum  officer  and  favorable  to  the  asylum  seeker;  and  otherwise  modifies \nlongstanding  guidance  to  artificially  and  unlawfully  achieve  the  Administration’s  aim  of \ndecreasing the number of individuals who pass credible fear screenings. \n88.  In its sum and its parts, the Lesson Plan is not consistent—in letter, spirit, or \npurpose—with the statutes, regulations, or caselaw on which it purports to instruct and guide. \n22 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 6   Filed 06/28/19   Page 24 of 28\nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF  \n(Refugee Act, Immigration and Nationality Act, Convention Against Torture, & \nAdministrative Procedure Act) \n89.  All the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully set forth \nherein. \n90.  Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3), this Court’s review is available to determine \nwhether the Lesson Plan is “consistent with applicable provisions of [Subchapter II of the INA] or \nis otherwise in violation of law.” \n91.  The APA provides that a Court “shall hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \nfindings, and conclusions found to be—(A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \notherwise not in accordance with law; (B) contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or \nimmunity; [or] (C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory \nright.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \n92.  The Refugee Act provides that “[a]ny alien who is physically present in the United \nStates or who arrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated port of arrival . . . ), \nirrespective of such alien’s status, may apply for asylum.”  8 U.S.C. § 1158(a). \n93.  Defendants are prohibited from removing individuals to a country where they will \nbe persecuted, see INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3); or tortured, see Convention Against Torture, Art. \n3; 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(c), (d).   \n94.  The INA, the Refugee Act, and the CAT must be interpreted consistently with the \nAmerican commitment to the principle of non-refoulement and the right to seek asylum as set forth \nin treaty obligations and in customary international law. \n95.  The credible fear policies contained in the Lesson Plan violate and are not in \naccordance with the INA, the Refugee Act, the CAT, or customary international law.   \n23 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 6   Filed 06/28/19   Page 25 of 28\n96.  The credible fear policies contained in the Lesson Plan are arbitrary and capricious, \nboth substantively and procedurally.   \n97.  Among other reasons, the credible fear policies contained in the Lesson Plan \nconflict with the statutory credible fear standard and process; conflict with various regulatory \nprovisions governing the credible fear standard and process, including as it relates to the CAT; \nrepresent departures from longstanding agency policy without so much as an acknowledgment of \nthose  departures,  much  less  reasoned  explanations  therefor;  are  illogical,  irrational,  legally \nerroneous, and fail to adequately take into account all relevant factors; and deprive credible fear \napplicants of a meaningful opportunity to establish their eligibility for asylum and other forms of \nhumanitarian relief.   \n98.  The Lesson Plan must therefore be held unlawful, set aside, or otherwise vacated. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Administrative Procedure Act)  \n99.  All the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully set forth \nherein. \n100.  The APA requires agency action that is substantive (or “legislative”) in nature to \nfollow notice-and-comment procedures.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \n101.  The Lesson Plan reflects one or more substantive rules, including because it has the \nforce and effect of law and because it conflicts with various regulatory provisions, effectively \namending them. \n102.  Defendants did not follow notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures related to \nthe Lesson Plan. \n103.  The Lesson Plan therefore must be held unlawful and set aside for Defendants’ \nfailure to observe the procedure required by the APA.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \n24 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-01872-KBJ   Document 6   Filed 06/28/19   Page 26 of 28\nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution) \n104.  All the foregoing allegations are repeated and incorporated as though fully set forth \nherein. \n105.  Plaintiffs have a protected interest in applying for asylum, withholding of removal, \nrelief under the CAT, and in not being removed to countries where they face serious danger, \npersecution, and potential loss of life. \n106.  Plaintiffs are entitled under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to a \nfair hearing of their claims, and a meaningful opportunity to establish their potential eligibility for \nasylum and other forms of relief from removal. \n107.  The credible fear policies contained in the Lesson Plan violated Plaintiffs’ right to \ndue process in numerous ways, including by subjecting their claims to unlawful, more burdensome \nlegal standards, and by depriving them of a meaningful opportunity to establish their eligibility for \nasylum and other forms of humanitarian relief. \n108.  The Lesson Plan must therefore be enjoined as violative of the Fifth Amendment’s \nguarantee of due process. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court: \n1.  “[A]dvance on the docket and . . . expedite to the greatest possible extent the \ndisposition” of this case, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(D); \n2.
