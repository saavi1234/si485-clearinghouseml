    "summary": "<p>On May 21, 2012, a Native American prisoner incarcerated at the McConnell Unit of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) filed this lawsuit, pro se, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas. The plaintiff sued five TDCJ employees under 42 U.S.C. § 1983: the Director of TDCJ, the Director of Chaplaincy Department, two chaplains, and the Deputy Director of Prison and Jail Operations. He claimed that TDCJ policies violated his rights under RLUIPA and the First Amendment. Specifically, he alleged that the TDCJ policies burdened the exercise of his religious beliefs by preventing him from: 1) smoking a prayer pipe during Native American pipe ceremonies; 2) wearing a religiously significant medicine bag other than within his cell and to and from religious ceremonies; 3) growing long hair, or alternatively, a kouplock, which is “a one inch square section of hair at the base of the skull.” Furthermore, he claimed the grooming policy violated his right to equal protection, because female prisoners were permitted to wear their hair long, but males were not. </p><p>The plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief requiring TDCJ to: 1) hire more Native American chaplains; 2) have security personnel available to supervise ceremonies until more chaplains could be hired; 3) allow the plaintiff to grow his hair, or alternatively, a kouplock; 4) smoke a prayer pipe at pipe ceremonies; and 5) wear medicine bags at all times. In addition, the plaintiff sought damages and attorney’s fees and costs. Immediately after filing the complaint, the plaintiff moved to join another Native American prisoner claiming to experience the same deprivations, to whom the Court granted leave to join in June 2012.</p><p>On June 12, 2012, Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos ordered the consolidation of <i>Davis v. Thaler</i>, docket number 2:12-cv-169 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, with this case because the two were duplicates of each other.  </p><p>At an evidentiary hearing held in front of Magistrate Judge B. Janice Ellington on June 21, 2012, the plaintiff orally moved for and was granted permission to add three employees as defendants: the Program Analyst for Designated Units, the Director of Rehabilitative Programs, and the McConnell Unit Chaplain. The plaintiffs again moved to add an additional defendant on July 12, 2012, and Judge Ellington permitted the Regional Chaplain to be added the following September.</p><p>On August 16, 2012, the initial plaintiff moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunctive relief. He alleged that he was not being allowed adequate time with his co-plaintiff in the law library to work on their lawsuit. Judge Ellington recommended denying this motion because the plaintiff had not explained what he could accomplish with more law library time and thus, did not suffer an irreparable injury. 2012 WL 4955289. Judge Ramos adopted these recommendations and denied the motion on October 16, 2012. 2012 WL 4959409.</p><p>On August 30, 2012, the McConnell Unit Chaplain filed a motion to dismiss, to which the plaintiffs agreed. The claims against McConnell Unit Chaplain were dismissed with prejudice.</p><p>On October 10, 2012, the Program Analyst moved to dismiss the claims against him. Judge Ellington recommended dismissing the plaintiffs’ claims for monetary damages against the Program Analyst in his official capacity, dismissing plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive relief against the Program Analyst in his individual capacity, and retaining the plaintiffs’ First Amendment claim for monetary damages against the Program Analyst in his individual capacity. On January 7, 2013, Judge Ramos adopted this recommendation. </p><p>The plaintiffs then filed an amended complaint on February 11, 2013 and consented to having a Magistrate Judge conduct all further proceedings. Shortly after, on February 22, 2013, they voluntarily dismissed all of their claims except their three RLUIPA challenges against the TDCJ Director in his official capacity and their First Amendment claim seeking damages against the Program Analyst in his individual capacity. The defendants also consented to proceed before a Magistrate Judge and Judge Ramos reassigned the case to Magistrate Judge Ellington for all further proceedings on April 29, 2013.</p><p>The defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on July 8, 2013. The plaintiffs responded with a cross-motion for summary judgment on July 19, 2013. Judge Ellington granted the defendants’ motion and entered a final judgment in the defendants’ favor for all claims on February 27, 2014. 2012 WL 4959409. On the RLUIPA claims, Judge Ellington found that the policies were a substantial burden on the plaintiffs’ exercise of their sincerely held beliefs, but that the defendants had demonstrated that they were employing the least restrictive means of furthering compelling governmental interests in security, controlling costs, and prison administration. On the First Amendment claim, Magistrate Judge Ellington found the Program Analyst defendant was entitled to qualified immunity because the plaintiffs had not established their First Amendment rights to exercise their religion had been violated. The plaintiffs appealed to the Fifth Circuit on April 2, 2014 and the docket number 14-40339 was assigned.</p><p>On July 6, 2016 the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court’s judgment in part and vacated in part. (Circuit Judges Leslie H. Southwick and Gregg J. Costa, District Judge Halil Suleyman Ozerden). The Fifth Circuit affirmed summary judgment for the defendants on the First Amendment claim and the medicine bag RLUIPA claim because the plaintiffs failed to offer explanation as to how the district court erred in granting summary judgment in their appeal. In addition, the Fifth Circuit affirmed summary judgment for the defendants on the pipe ceremony RLUIPA claim, agreeing with the district court that the logistical, health, and security concerns of permitting the plaintiffs to purchase their own pipes and store them in the chaplain’s office outweighed the need for a religious accommodation. However, the Fifth Circuit vacated and remanded the grooming policy claim under RLUIPA because it was unclear if the district court considered all of the plaintiffs’ summary judgment evidence. Furthermore, the legitimacy of TDJC’s cost and security concerns over the wearing of a kouplock remained disputed, and the district court didn’t consider the plaintiffs’ claim in light of their individual circumstances as low security risk prisoners. 826 F.3d 258. </p><p>On remand, the district court ordered additional briefing. The defendants filed a motion for clarification of appeal, and on August 8, 2016, the Fifth Circuit clarified there was not a need for a trial at this time. Only additional briefing and a reexamination of the motion for summary judgment on the RLUIPA grooming policy claim was necessary. The parties then filed numerous replies and responses.</p><p>On March 7, 2017, Judge Ellington denied the defendant’s motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs’ RLUIPA grooming policy claim because there remained a material dispute as to whether the grooming policy was the least restrictive means of maintaining institutional security. 2017 WL 896299. Judge Ellington recommended that the Fifth Circuit remand the case for trial.</p><p>In November 2015, the initial prisoner plaintiff was released. In response, on December 21, 2017, the defendant moved to dismiss his claims. The defendant argued that the grooming policy no longer affected this plaintiff’s right to practice his Native American faith and the plaintiff lacked an injury that was likely to be redressed by a favorable decision. Judge Ellington agreed and granted the motion on January 25, 2018.</p><p>On March 2, 2018, the Court on its own motion ordered the consolidation of cases <i>Casey v. Davis</i> (2:14-cv-13) and <i>Cobb v. Morris</i> (2:14-cv-22) with this case. The plaintiffs in these cases challenged the same policies of TDJC, alleging that these policies conflicted with their right to practice their Native American faith in violation of RLUIPA and the First Amendment. Similar to <i>Goodman v. Davis</i>, only the plaintiffs’ RLUIPA grooming policy claim survived summary judgment and was set for trial. The cases were accordingly consolidated for trial in front of Judge Ramos. On March 5, 2018, the Court appointed pro-bono counsel from a private firm to represent each of the plaintiffs in the consolidated action. The plaintiffs had previously attempted to get counsel appointed four times, but each time were denied.</p><p>In July 2018, trial was set for August 29, 2018. Additionally, during this time, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint, setting forth their RLUIPA grooming policy claim against the TDCJ Director together.</p><p>A bench trial was held before Judge Ramos from August 29, 2018 to August 31, 2018. Judge Ramos issued the Court’s findings of fact and conclusion of law on January 24, 2019. He granted the plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief permitting them to grow their hair long, consistent with their Native American religious beliefs. The Court noted that the differences between male and female grooming policies was unrelated to any differences in violence, contraband, or hygiene. The Court highlighted how most jails, most state Department of Corrections, and the federal prison system allow male prisoners to have long hair. Furthermore, TDCJ’s employees testified they had never found contraband in long, loose hair and only nuisance contraband in braided hair, casting doubt on their alleged security interests. Finally, the defendant was unable to show that searches would take longer or that the plaintiffs, whom all had little or no history of disciplinary violations, posed any particular danger or threat to prison security. </p><p>Judge Ramos entered a final judgment in the plaintiffs’ favor on February 26, 2019 and enjoined the defendant from enforcing its male grooming policy against the plaintiffs with respect to the rules preventing the plaintiffs from growing their hair without restriction and wearing it loose. The plaintiffs were also awarded reasonable attorney’s fees and costs. Costs were later determined to be $9,803.19, and attorney's fees were $131,298.45.</p><p>On March 27, 2019, the defendant appealed Judge Ramos’ findings and final judgment to the Fifth Circuit, and the docket number 19-40279 was assigned. Shortly after, the defendant moved to dismiss its own appeal, and the Fifth Circuit granted the motion to dismiss the appeal on July 9, 2019. This case is now closed.</p><p></p>",

He sued multiple TDCJ employees under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. He alleged that TDJC policies that prevented his smoking a prayer pipe during Native American pipe ceremonies, limited his ability to wear a religiously significant medicine bag, and prevented him from growing long hair violated his rights under RLUIPA and the First Amendment. He sought declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief as well as attorney's fees and costs. An additional Native American prisoner plaintiff joined the suit shortly after filing. \r\n\r\nIn February 2013, the plaintiffs amended their complaint, consented to proceedings before a Magistrate Judge, and voluntarily dismissed all of their claims except their three RLUIPA challenges against the TDCJ Director in his official capacity and their First Amendment claim seeking damages against the Program Analyst in his individual capacity. The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. On February 27, 2014, the defendant’s motion for summary judgment was granted and a final judgment entered in their favor. The plaintiffs appealed to the Fifth Circuit and were successful in getting judgement on the RLUIPA grooming policy claim vacated and remanded. On remand, the defendant’s motion for summary judgment on the RLUIPA grooming claim was denied. As the RLUIPA grooming policy claim moved towards trial, the initial prisoner plaintiff in the case was released and his claims were dismissed. The Court ordered the consolidation of cases Casey v. Davis (2:14-cv-13) and Cobb v. Morris (2:14-cv-22) with this case, as the two cases also were brought by Native American prisoner incarcerated at the McConnell Unit and involved RLUIPA grooming policy claims moving towards trial. After a bench trial, Judge Ramos granted plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief permitting them to grow their hair long, consistent with their Native American religious beliefs and entered a final judgment on February 26, 2019. The defendant appealed, but moved to dismiss the appeal shortly after. The Fifth Circuit granted the motion to dismiss the appeal on July 9, 2019. This case is closed.",

On September 17, 2012, \nUnited  States  Magistrate  Judge  B.  Janice  Ellington  issued  a  Memorandum  and \nRecommendation (D.E. 41), recommending that Plaintiff’s Motion be denied.  Plaintiffs \nDavis and Goodman filed their Objections (D.E. 48) on October 3, 2012. \nPlaintiffs, in their Objections, repeat their argument that they are being denied law \nlibrary time to confer together in violation of ATC-050, which outlines the prison policy \nfor law library usage for joint sessions.  They aver generally that the Memorandum and \nRecommendation reaches the wrong conclusion. \nPlaintiffs have not identified any defect in the Magistrate Judge’s outline of the \nlaw applicable to motions for injunctive relief.  Neither have they demonstrated that they \nhave satisfied their burden of proof on any of the four elements governing the issuance of \ninjunctive relief.  In fact, they have not even demonstrated (1) that they have complied \n1 / 2 \n\nwith the ATC-050 policy regarding the manner in which such joint sessions must be \nrequested  or  (2)  that  specific  requests  that  have  been  submitted  have  actually  been \ndenied.   \nWhile they outline the sessions that have been granted and have identified which \nones have included joint conferences, they have not shown how those sessions have been \ninadequate or that they are being denied the ability to prepare for a certain deadline.  \nInjunctive relief is an extraordinary remedy and Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that \nthey are entitled to such relief.  Plaintiffs’ Objections are OVERRULED. \nHaving reviewed the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations \nset  forth  in  the  Magistrate  Judge’s  Memorandum  and  Recommendation,  as  well  as \nPlaintiffs’ Objections, and all other relevant documents in the record, and having made a \nde  novo  disposition  of  the  portions  of  the  Magistrate  Judge’s  Memorandum  and \nRecommendation  to  which  objections  were  specifically  directed,  the  Court \nOVERRULES  Plaintiffs’  Objections  and  ADOPTS  as  its  own  the  findings  and \nconclusions of the Magistrate Judge.  Accordingly, the “Motion Requesting Temporary \nRestraining Order/Preliminary Injunction Relief” (D.E. 29).  is DENIED.  \n  ORDERED this 16th day of October, 2012. \n \n \n___________________________________ \nNELVA GONZALES RAMOS \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n2 / 2 ",

Plaintiff Robbie Dow Goodman is an incarcerated person, TDCJ identification \nnumber 758386, currently housed at the William G. McConnell Prison Unit. \n2.  Plaintiff William Casey is an incarcerated person, TDCJ identification number \n683809, currently housed at the William G. McConnell Prison Unit. \n3.  Plaintiff Raymond Cobb is an incarcerated person, TDCJ identification number \n1306425, currently housed at the William G. McConnell Prison Unit. \n4.  Defendant Lorie Davis is the Director of the Correctional Institution Division, \nTexas Department of Criminal Justice. \n   \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 271   Filed on 07/24/18 in TXSD   Page 2 of 5\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5.  This court has personal jurisdiction over the Defendant because the Defendant is a \ncitizen of the forum and because Plaintiffs’ claims arise from Defendant’s acts or omissions in the \nforum. \n6.  This court has subject matter jurisdiction over this matter under 28 U.S.C. §1331 \nbecause Plaintiffs’ claims arise under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States. \n7.  Venue  is  proper  in  this  district  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  §1391(b)  because  the \nDefendant resides in this district and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to \nPlaintiffs’ claims have occurred and continue to occur in this district. \nBACKGROUND \n8.  Plaintiffs are non-violent, low security risk inmates in the custody of the TDCJ.  \n9.  Plaintiff Casey has been in the TDCJ’s custody since 1994. He is of Cherokee \ndescent. He has been in G2 custody (the second lowest security risk group status) throughout his \ntime in custody. He has never participated in behavior that caused his custody status level to be \nincreased, and has received only two minor disciplinary infractions in over fifteen years. Prior to \nhis transfer to prison, Casey was incarcerated in a Texas jail that allowed inmates to have long \nhair.  Casey had long hair during his time in jail.   \n10.  Plaintiff Cobb has been in the TDCJ’s custody since 1997. He was initially placed \nin G3 custody status, and his custody status was improved to G2 in March 2007. He has never \nparticipated in behavior that caused his custody status level to be increased, and has had only two \nminor disciplinary infractions in over twenty years of incarceration. Prior to his transfer to prison, \nCobb was incarcerated in a Texas jail that allowed inmates to have long hair.  Cobb had long hair \nduring his time in jail.   \n- 2 - \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 271   Filed on 07/24/18 in TXSD   Page 3 of 5\n11.  Plaintiff Goodman has been in the TDCJ’s custody since 1996.  His custody level \nis G2. He has not participated in behavior that caused his custody status level to be increased in \nover a decade. Prior to his transfer to prison, Goodman was incarcerated in a Texas jail that allowed \ninmates to have long hair.  Goodman had long hair during his time in jail.   \n12.  Plaintiffs are sincere adherents and practitioners of traditional Native American \nreligious beliefs. They regularly attend weekly meetings where they teach others that are new to \nthe Native American faith, and meet monthly with visiting Native American chaplains to perform \npipe ceremonies.   \n13.  Plaintiffs sincerely believe that an important element of practicing their religion is \nto grow their hair long and to cut it only in times of mourning.  \n14.  Defendant’s current grooming policy, set forth below, requires Plaintiffs to cut their \nhair, seriously violating their religious beliefs and prohibiting their religious practice of wearing \nlong hair: \n“Male offenders shall keep their hair trimmed up the back of their \nneck and head. Hair shall be neatly cut. Hair shall be cut around the \nears. Sideburns shall not extend below the middle of the ears. No \nblock style, afro, or shag haircuts shall be permitted. No fad or \nextreme  hairstyles/haircuts  are  allowed.  No  mohawks,  tails,  or \ndesigns cut into the hair are allowed.” \n15.  The policy makes no exception for male inmates who seek to wear long, unbraided \nhair on religious grounds. At the same time, the TDCJ allows for female inmates to wear their hair \nlong. Male inmates in Texas are also allowed to wear their hair long while in the custody of the \nTexas jails. The vast majority of prison systems throughout the country allow male prisoners to \nhave long hair. \n16.  Defendant’s policy substantially burdens Plaintiffs’ religious practice of wearing \nlong hair.  Defendant’s policy requires them to engage in conduct that seriously violates their \n- 3 - \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 271   Filed on 07/24/18 in TXSD   Page 4 of 5\nreligious beliefs because it requires them to cut their hair and prevents them from growing their \nhair long.  Plaintiffs face serious disciplinary action if they refuse to cut their hair in contravention \nof the Defendant’s policy. Among other things, these disciplinary charges can result in loss of \nprivileges and adversely affect time-earning classifications and good time credits.  \n17.  The TDCJ’s current policy does not further any compelling governmental interest, \nnor is the policy for all male inmates the least restrictive alternative to accomplish any such \ninterest. \nCOUNT I1 \n18.  Defendant’s actions violate the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons \nAct, 42 U.S.C. § 2000-cc-1 (“RLUIPA”). \n19.  Defendant’s grooming policy is a substantial burden on the religious exercise of the \nPlaintiffs.   Specifically, Defendant’s policy seriously violates their sincerely held belief that they \nshould not cut their hair and that their hair should be allowed to grow unrestricted in length.   \n20.  Defendant’s grooming policy does not further a compelling governmental interest. \n21.  Assuming that Defendant’s policy did further a compelling governmental interest, \nthe policy is not the least restrictive means of furthering any such interest. \nPRAYER \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs seek the following relief: \na.  an injunction ordering the Defendant to allow the Plaintiffs to grow their \nhair unrestricted in length; \n \n                                                            \n1 This Court previously granted summary judgment against Plaintiffs for claims under the First Amendment, the use \nof a medicine bag under RLUIPA, participating in a traditional pipe ceremony under RLUIPA, insufficient number \nof Native American chaplains under RLUIPA, insufficient number of Native American ceremonies under RLUIPA, \nand violation of religious beliefs under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and dismissed those claims with prejudice.  2:12-CV-166, \nD.E. 231; 2:14-CV-13, D.E. 91; 2:14-CV-22, D.E. 38.  Plaintiffs reserve all rights of appeal as to the dismissed \nclaims and incorporate all allegations, factual and legal, related to those claims in their prior complaints, as if set \nforth in full.  Plaintiffs acknowledge, however, that the procedural effect of the court’s dismissal is that the \ndismissed claims will be not be included in the upcoming trial on the merits.   \n- 4 - \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 271   Filed on 07/24/18 in TXSD   Page 5 of 5\nb.  reasonable attorney’s fees and costs pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 54 and 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b). \n \nc.  all other relief, legal or equitable, to which the Plaintiffs are justly entitled.  \n \nDated this 23rd day of July, 2018.

William Stephens  is and has \nenforced  rules  and  regulations  that restrict Plaintiffs from constitutionally \nprotected rights to practice his  religion  (way  of  life)  in the  least restrictive \nmeans. \n(1)  TDCJ  CID  has a  grooming  standard that restricts Plaintiffs from  growing \nhis  long  hair.  it  is an established way  of  life that Native Americans grow \ntheir hair long  and  that the only  time  it is cut  is during  a  time  that Plaintiffs \nare mourning,  in which  could  last up  to one year. \nTDCJ-CID  A.D.  07.30  policy  #  3.83 Grooming  Standards state that they \nare supposed  to be  enforced with  no  exemption based on  religious beliefs. \nThey  state  that  male  offenders must  keep their hair trimmed  up  the back of \ntheir  neck  and  head.  Hair  must  be  neatly cut.  Hair must  be  cut around the \nears. \nAlso  see  TDCJ-CID  Displainary  Handbook  Offense  Code  #  24.1  Refusing  to \ncomply  with  Grooming  standards  pg.#  22  Att.  C-1.

This punishment  can \nkeep  offender  from  going  horne  on  parole because of disciplanary cases.  Under \nRLUIPA  this  kind  of  punishment  is  what  they do  not  allow. \n#(2)  TDCJ-CID  has  denied  Plaintiffs the right to wear  his medicine  bag  at \nall  times  even  though  the  Native  American  policy stated that outside the \nprison  sett1.ng  they  are  worn  daily.  There  is no  reason why  'rDCJ  CID  cannot \nallow them  to be worn  daily because policy says  they  can do  a  visual  inspection \nat any  time  for  security reasons  to see  if contrabnd  is inside. \n( 1) \n\n. \n''  Case 2:14-cv-00022   Document 1   Filed on 01/21/14 in TXSD   Page 7 of 12\nl  • \n(3)  TDCJ-CID  has  allowed  Prayer  Pipe  ceremonies  in their prison setting from \n1996  up  to  July  2012  and  then took them  away  from  the Native American \nPractitioners.

TDCJ-CID  does  not  allow any  least restrictive \nmeans  due  to policies they enforce. \nWilliam  Stephens  is being  sued  in his official capacity for  implementing \npolicies  that  violate  my  constitutional  rights  under  RLUIPA  under  least \nrestrictive means. \nClint Morris  is being sued  in his  individual  capacity for  First Amendment \nviolation  for  failure to act according  to his  iob discription in which  caused \nthe  violation  of  my  Constitutional rights.  Denying  Plaintiffs the  right to \nhave  traditional  Pipe  Ceremonies  per TDCJ-CID  policies  in which  were  in effect \nat  the  time  he  was  hired  in  2009  to over see the Native  American  Units  and \nmake  sure  they  had  their  required  ceremonies before he  played a  personal \nrole  in  changing  the  native  American  policy to which  led to TDCJ  stopping \nPipe  ceremonies.  Originally  the  TDCJ  offenders could smoke  the sacred Pipe \nper  policy.  Now  they are not  afforded the opportnity to smoke  the  :pipe any \nmore  due  to the New  July policy in which  is a  violation of my  constitutional \nrights  because  there  is  no  least  restrictive means  available to me  so  I \ncan  pray  traditionally.  From  the  time  period of Sept.  2008  up  till July \n2012  Plaintiff  has  not  had  his pipe ceremonies as was  in effect until July \n2012  when  the new  policy came  into effect. \nPlaintiff has  shown  Three(3)  policies  in which  are  in effect that violate \nhis  constitutional  rights  under  RLUIPA  under  the least restrictive means, \nand  how  he  is forcefully required  to  cut his hair against religious beliefs \n• 1, \nand  practices  or  be  subiect  to more  critical punishment  for  not  complying \nto TDCJ  Grooming  Policies.

TDCJ  Contract Chaplains cannot release the  inmates own  personal \nprayer from  the prayer pipe because  they don't know  each  persons  personal \nprayers.  However  the Contract Native American  chaplains can say a  prayer  for \nyou  and  release their prayer  for you.  This  again  is not allowing  each  inmate \nto say or release their own  prayers because  they have  to become  one with  the \nsacred pipe and  smoke  it and release  their very own  prayers to the great spirit. \nPlaintiff seeks monetary damages  against Clint Morris  in his  individual \ncapacity for  violating my  Constitutional  right by personally playing a  role in \nthe new  policy change  in which  now  prohibits the Native Americans  the  right \nto personaaly smoke  and  release their own  prayers.  His  own  job discription \nwas  not  complied with  that he was  hired to do  and  the very ommition  to this \nnon  compliance to a  policy that was  in effect when  he was  hired to oversee  the \nNative American  community  is also what  caused  the violation of my  First Amendment \nrights. \nPlaintiff seek not only the requested  relief above  ,  but also  seeks  court \ncost  and  other monies  entitled to him  as well. \n( 3) \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00022   Document 1   Filed on 01/21/14 in TXSD   Page 9 of 12\nFICE USE ONL \nTexas Department of Criminal Justice  .')6 I )t5.J'J.J,~ \nOCT Z8   2013 \nSTEP2  UGI Reed Date: \nOFFENDER  3 1 20l3 \nHQRecdDatePCT \nGRIEVANCE FORM \n\\ '\\-~ \nDate Due: --i~~cb.P--~=-\"\"\"-----\nJl ' ~ \nOffender Name:  Raymond  cobb  TDCJ# 1306425  Grievance Code: \nID#@ bQ \nUnit:  w; ll jam G.

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS\nCORPUS CHRISTI DIVISION\nTEDDY NORRIS DAVIS,  §\nET AL., §\nPlaintiffs §\n§\nv. § CASE NO. 2:12cv166\n§\nRICK THALER, ET AL., §\nDefendants. §\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER DENYING \nMOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL\nPlaintiff Davis is an inmate assigned to the McConnell Unit of TDCJ-CID.  He alleges in this\nlawsuit filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 that defendants violated the Religious Land Use and\nInstitutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000cc, et seq., as well as his First\nAmendment Right to practice his Native American faith (D.E. 1).  Pending is plaintiff Davis’s1\nsecond  motion for appointment of counsel (D.E. 43).  \n  In Bounds v. Smith, the Supreme Court held that a prisoner's constitutional right of access\nto the courts requires that the access be meaningful; that is, prison officials must provide pro se\nlitigants with writing materials, access to the law library, or other forms of legal assistance.  Bounds\nv. Smith, 430 U.S. 817, 829 (1977).  There is, however, no constitutional right to appointment of\ncounsel in civil rights cases.  Akasike v. Fitzpatrick, 26 F.3d 510, 512 (5th Cir. 1994); Branch v.\nCole, 686 F.2d 264, 266 (5th Cir. 1982).  Further, Bounds did not create  a \"free-standing right to\n1Plaintiff Davis has been warned in numerous orders and during a telephone conference call\nthat he cannot file motions on behalf of plaintiff Goodman because Davis is not a lawyer and cannot\nrepresent plaintiff Goodman.  Plaintiff Goodman must either sign the motion, or he must file his own\nmotion.  If plaintiff Davis files another pleading on behalf of plaintiff Goodman without the\nsignature of Goodman on the pleading, sanctions will be ordered.  The sanctions may include\nstriking of pleadings and  monetary sanctions, and if plaintiff continues to disregard orders of the\ncourt, he may face dismissal of his lawsuit.\n\na law library or legal assistance.\"  Lewis v. Casey, 116 S. Ct. 2174, 2180 (1996).  It is within the\nCourt's discretion to appoint counsel, unless the case presents \"exceptional circumstances,\" thus\nrequiring the appointment.  28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(1); Cupit v. Jones, 835 F.2d 82, 86 (5th Cir. 1987).\nA number of factors should be examined when determining whether to appoint counsel.\nJackson v. Dallas Police Department, 811 F.2d 260, 261-62 (5th Cir. 1986) (citing Ulmer v.\nChancellor, 691 F.2d 209 (5th Cir. 1982)).  The first is the type and complexity of the case.  Id.  The\ncase is fairly simple.  Plaintiff seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief because he is unable\nto wear a kouplock, participate in traditional pipe ceremonies, and carry his medicine pouch at all\ntimes.  An evidentiary hearing was held on June 21, 2012, and his claims were retained and service\nof process ordered.  Though serious, at this stage of the case plaintiff’s allegations are not complex.\nThe second and third factors are whether the plaintiff is in a position to adequately\ninvestigate and present his case.  Plaintiff’s pleadings and his testimony during the evidentiary\nhearing demonstrate that he is reasonably intelligent, articulate, and able to describe the facts\nunderlying his claims.  He is aware of the law, and has assisted another inmate in the prosecution\nof similar claims previously.  He appears, at this stage of the case, to be in a position to adequately\ninvestigate and present his case.  \nThe fourth factor which should be examined is whether the evidence will consist in large part\nof conflicting testimony so as to require skill in the presentation of evidence and in cross-\nexamination.  Examination of this factor is premature.  The case has not been set for trial; in fact a\ndeadline for dispositive motions has not yet been set.\nPlaintiff has not shown that exceptional circumstances require the appointment of counsel\nat this time.  In addition, there is no indication that appointed counsel would aid in the efficient and\n2\n\nequitable disposition of the case.  The Court has the authority to award attorneys' fees to a prevailing\nplaintiff.  42 U.S.C. § 1988.  Plaintiff is not prohibited from hiring an attorney on a contingent-fee\narrangement.  Plaintiff's motion for appointment of counsel (D.E. 43) is denied without prejudice\nat this time.  This order will be sua sponte reexamined as the case proceeds, particularly if the case\nis scheduled for trial.\nORDERED this 2nd day of October, 2012.\n____________________________________\n B.

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS\nCORPUS CHRISTI DIVISION\nTEDDY NORRIS GREY HAWK DAVIS,  §\nET AL., §\nPlaintiffs §\n§\nv. § CASE NO. 2:12cv166\n§\nRICK THALER, ET AL., §\nDefendants. §\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER DENYING \nMOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL\nPlaintiff is an inmate assigned to the McConnell Unit of TDCJ-CID.  He alleges in this\nlawsuit filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 that defendants violated the Religious Land Use and\nInstitutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000cc, et seq., as well as his First\nAmendment Right to practice his Native American faith (D.E. 1).  Pending is plaintiff’s motion for\nappointment of counsel (D.E. 4).  \n  In Bounds v. Smith, the Supreme Court held that a prisoner's constitutional right of access\nto the courts requires that the access be meaningful; that is, prison officials must provide pro se\nlitigants with writing materials, access to the law library, or other forms of legal assistance.  Bounds\nv. Smith, 430 U.S. 817, 829 (1977).  There is, however, no constitutional right to appointment of\ncounsel in civil rights cases.  Akasike v. Fitzpatrick, 26 F.3d 510, 512 (5th Cir. 1994); Branch v.\nCole, 686 F.2d 264, 266 (5th Cir. 1982).  Further, Bounds did not create  a \"free-standing right to\na law library or legal assistance.\"  Lewis v. Casey, 116 S. Ct. 2174, 2180 (1996).  It is within the\nCourt's discretion to appoint counsel, unless the case presents \"exceptional circumstances,\" thus\nrequiring the appointment.  28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(1); Cupit v. Jones, 835 F.2d 82, 86 (5th Cir. 1987).\n\nA number of factors should be examined when determining whether to appoint counsel.\nJackson v. Dallas Police Department, 811 F.2d 260, 261-62 (5th Cir. 1986) (citing Ulmer v.\nChancellor, 691 F.2d 209 (5th Cir. 1982)).  The first is the type and complexity of the case.  Id.  The\ncase is fairly simple.  Plaintiff seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief because he is unable\nto wear a kouplock, participate in traditional pipe ceremonies, and carry his medicine pouch at all\ntimes.  An evidentiary hearing was held on June 21, 2012, and his claims will likely be retained and\nservice of process ordered.  Though serious, at this stage of the case plaintiff’s allegations are not\ncomplex.\nThe second and third factors are whether the plaintiff is in a position to adequately\ninvestigate and present his case.  Plaintiff’s pleadings and his testimony during the evidentiary\nhearing demonstrate that he is reasonably intelligent, articulate, and able to describe the facts\nunderlying his claims.  He is aware of the law, and has assisted another inmate in the prosecution\nof similar claims previously.  He appears, at this stage of the case, to be in a position to adequately\ninvestigate and present his case.  \nThe fourth factor which should be examined is whether the evidence will consist in large part\nof conflicting testimony so as to require skill in the presentation of evidence and in cross-\nexamination.  Examination of this factor is premature.  The case has not been set for trial; in fact\nservice of process has not yet been ordered.\nPlaintiff has not shown that exceptional circumstances require the appointment of counsel\nat this time.  In addition, there is no indication that appointed counsel would aid in the efficient and\nequitable disposition of the case.  The Court has the authority to award attorneys' fees to a prevailing\nplaintiff.  42 U.S.C. § 1988.  Plaintiff is not prohibited from hiring an attorney on a contingent-fee\n2\n\narrangement.  Plaintiff's motion for appointment of counsel (D.E. 4) is denied without prejudice at\nthis time.  This order will be sua sponte reexamined as the case proceeds, particularly if the case is\nscheduled for trial.\nORDERED this 22nd day of June, 2012.\n____________________________________\n B.

In order for your complaint to be filed, it must be accompanied by the filing fee of $350.00 . \n2.  If you do not have the necessary funds to pay the filing fee in full at this time, you may request permission to \nproceed in forma pauperis.  In this event you must complete the application to proceed in forma pauperis \n(IFP), setting forth the information to establish your inability to prepay the fees and costs or give security \ntherefore.  You must also include a six (6) month history of your Inmate Trust Account.

If you submit the application to proceed in forma pauperis, the Court will apply 28 \nU.S.C.  1915 and, if appropriate, assess and collect the entire filing fee or an initial partial filing fee, then \nmonthly installments from your Inmate Account, until the entire $350 filing fee has been paid. \n4.

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS\nCORPUS CHRISTI DIVISION\nTEDDY NORRIS DAVIS, ET AL., §\nPlaintiffs, §\nv. §     CAUSE NO. 2:12-cv-166             \n§\nRICK THALER, ET AL., §\nDefendants. §\nOPINION AND ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT’S\nMOTION FOR RULE 7(a) REPLY\nPending is defendant Madeline Ortiz’s motion for Rule 7(a) reply (D.E. 52); neither\nof the two plaintiffs has filed an objection to the motion.1  For the reasons stated herein, Ms.\nOrtiz’s Rule 7(a) motion is granted.  Plaintiff s are ordered to answer the questions set forth\nherein within thirty (30) days of the date of entry of this Order and to serve a copy on Ms.\nOrtiz. \nI.  Background\nIn this prisoner civil rights action filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, plaintiffs Teddy\nNorris Davis and Robbie Dow Goodman allege that defendants have violated, and continue\nto violate, their right to practice their Native American religion, in violation of provisions of\nthe Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (“RLUPIA”), 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc,\nand the First Amendment. Plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief from the Texas\nDepartment of Criminal Justice, Criminal Institutions Division (“TDCJ-CID”) to: (1) hire\nmore Native American chaplains; (2) have security personnel available to supervise the\n1 Pursuant to Local Rule 7.4, failure to respond is taken as a representation of no opposition.\n\nNative American religious ceremonies until such time that more Native American chaplains\ncan be hired; (3) allow plaintiffs to grow their hair or allow them to grow a kouplock; (4)\nsmoke the ceremonial pipe at pipe ceremonies; (5) wear their medicine bags at all times; (6)\ndamages for violations of their First Amendment rights; and (7) and court costs.  (See D.E.\n1, 16). \nPlaintiffs have sued Ms. Ortiz in both her individual and official capacities.  (D.E. 16\nat 2).  Plaintiffs identify Ms. Ortiz as the  Director of Rehabilitative Programs for the TDCJ,\nand claim that the Chaplaincy Department falls under her supervision.  Plaintiffs contend that\nshe approved the decision to prohibit traditional pipe ceremonies, in conflict with McConnell\nUnit policy, and in violation of RLUIPA and the First Amendment.  Plaintiff Davis also\ntestified that he wrote letters to Ms. Ortiz concerning the pipe ceremonies, but that she did\nnot answer his inquiries and simply forwarded them to defendant Clint Morris.  (See D.E. 26,\nJune 21, 2012 Evidentiary Hearing Transcript at p. 31, line 8 - p. 32, line 10).  \nOn August 27, 2012, Madeline Ortiz filed her answer and raised the defense of\nqualified immunity.  (D.E. 30). \nII.  Rule 7(a) Request\nIn her request for a Rule 7(a) reply, Madeline Ortiz points out that, except for plaintiff\nDavis’s brief testimony at the evidentiary hearing, neither Davis nor Goodman has stated\nwith any specificity in either the original or amended complaint any facts that explain what\nacts or omissions of Madeline Ortiz in her individual capacity violated plaintiffs’ First\nAmendment rights.  Indeed, Ms. Ortiz contends that plaintiffs’ claims against her arise solely\n2\n\nfrom her supervisory role in the TDCJ, which fails to state a cognizable § 1983 claim.  See\nMonell v. Department of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 690-92 (1978) (section 1983 will not\nsupport a claim based on respondeat superior or vicarious liability.”).\nIII.  Discussion\nRule 7(a) of  the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes the district court to\n“order a reply to an answer.”   The Fifth Circuit has held en banc that an individual defendant\nwho pleads immunity to a federal civil action is entitled to have the plaintiff ordered to reply\nunder Rule 7.  Schultea v. Wood, 47 F.3d 1427, 1433 (5th Cir. 1995) (en banc).  The\nSchultea Court stated:\nSuch  an  order  will  require  the  Plaintiff  to  reply  to  that\n[immunity] defense in detail.  By definition, the reply must be\ntailored to the assertion of qualified immunity and fairly engage\nits allegations... . [The] Plaintiff [must] support his claim with\nsufficient precision and factual specificity to raise a genuine\nissue as to the illegality of the defendant’s conduct at the time of\nthe alleged acts.  \nId., 47 F.3d at 1434.  “A plaintiff cannot overcome a qualified immunity defense with mere\nconclusory allegations [but] must plead specific facts with sufficient particularity ... to negate\nthe defense of qualified immunity.”  Burns-Toole v. Byrne, 11 F.3d 1270, 1274, cert. denied,\n512 U.S. 1207 (1994) (citing Elliott v. Perez, 751 F.2d 1472, 1479, 1482 (5th Cir. 1985)).\nThe Fifth Circuit continues to require that plaintiffs suing governmental officials in\ntheir individual capacities must allege specific conduct giving rise to a constitutional\nviolation.  Anderson v. Pasadena Indep. Sch. Dist., 184 F.3d 439, 443 (5th Cir. 1999).  That\nis, in order to survive, § 1983 actions against defendants in their individual capacities “must\n3\n\nbe pled with factual detail and particularity, not mere conclusory allegations.”  Id.  \nMs. Ortiz has raised the defense of qualified immunity.  (D.E. 30).  She argues that,\nencompassed within this defense, is the right to be informed of the allegations against her in\na fact- specific way.  As it stands now, plaintiffs have failed to identify any specific date,\ntime, or place in which Ms. Ortiz personally denied either plaintiff the right to practice his\nreligion.  So that Ms. Ortiz might properly respond to plaintiffs’ allegations,  plaintiffs are\neach hereby ORDERED to answer the following questions within thirty (30) days of the\ndate of entry of this Order:\n(1) List all dates (and times, if available) that you personally met with Ms. Ortiz\nregarding any aspect of the practice of your Native American beliefs, including\npipe  ceremonies,  kouplocks,  possession  of  medicine  bags,  and  chaplain\navailability.  Describe the meetings with as much detail as you can remember,\nsuch as if you were in your cell, or her office. Were other inmates around that\ncan confirm the conversation took place?\n(2) List all dates that you corresponded with Ms. Ortiz, via letter, grievances, I-\n60s, or any other manner concerning the practice of your Native American\nreligion.  Submit a copy of the correspondence if available, and if not, describe\nthe nature of the communication.  Describe any response you received from\nMs. Ortiz or any other prison official. \n(3) In what manner do you believe Ms. Ortiz acted unreasonably regarding your\nFirst Amendment rights?  What actions do you believe she should have taken?\nLabel your pleading “Rule 7(a) Reply.”  In addition, include the following declaration\nat the end of your reply.  “I declare, under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United\nStates of America, that the foregoing is true and correct.  See 28 U.S.C. § 1746.”  The\ndeclaration must be dated and signed, and each plaintiff must submit his own individual Rule\n7(a) reply. \n4\n\nIn lieu of complying with this order, should either plaintiff desire to dismiss his First\nAmendment claims against Madeline Ortiz in her individual capacity, he may sign and return\nthe attached motion for voluntary dismissal. \nORDERED this 15th day of November, 2012.\n____________________________________\n B.

I  am  bein'.;j  denied  consistant and  meaningful \naccess  to the practice of my  reli<;;ion,  which  is a  violation of 42  u.s.c.  § \n1983 by  virtue of the defendants  infrinyment of the Plaintiffs rights \nunder  the First Amendment  to the United  states Constitution;  and  violation \nof 42  u.s.c.  §  2000-cc-1,  the Religious  Land  Use  and  Institutionalized Persons \nAct  (RLUIPA). \nWilliam Stephens  (Dir.  of TDCJ-CID)  is a  policy maker  and  is responsible \nto ensure  that Plaintiffs religious  requirements are met.  defendant William \nStephens has deliberately denied Plaintiff the  right to:  (1)  Grow  his  long \nHair;  (2)  wear  his medicine  bag  at all times;  (3)  have  traditional Pipe \nceremonies as  Plaintiff is a  Native American  practitioner.  William Stephens \nis and has enforced rules and regulations  that restrict Plaintiff from \nconstitutionally protected rights  to practice his religion  (way  of  life)  in \nthe  least restrictive means. \n(1)  TDCJ-CID  has  a  c;roominq  stan::lard  that  restricts Plaintit::s  from \nqrowinq  his  lonq  hair.  it is an  established way  of  life that Native  Americans \nqrow  their hair  lonq  ,  and  that the only  time  that Plaintiffs cut their hair  is \nin mourninq  for  the  loss of a  close  family  of  friend.  This  could  last  to one \nu~ \nyear.  TDCJ-CID  A.D.  07.30 policy  #  3.83 Groominq  Standards  state that they are \nto be enforced with  no  exemption  based on  reliqious beliefs.  They  state \nsu~~osed \nthat male offenders must  kee0  their hair trimmed  up  the back of  their neck and \nhead.  Hair must be  neatlv cut.  Hair must be cut around  the ears. \nAlso  see TDCJ-CID  disciplanary Handbook  Offense Coc)e  jt24.01  Refusinq  to \ncom~ly with Groominq  Standards  pq.  #  22  Att.  C-1.  Also  Offender Orientation \nHandbook  states that an offender  in  violation of  the qroominq  standards are \nsub-lect  to disciolanarv actions such as:  loosinq  qood  time.  line class.  and \noossiblv beino  olaced  into seqreoated confinement.  This  punishment can keep  the \noffender  from  qoinq  home  on  parole because of disciolanarv cases.  Under  RLUIPA \nthis kind of punishment  is what  they do  not allow. \n(2)  TDCJ-CID  has denied  Plaintiffs the  riqht  to wear  his medicine baq  at \nall times  even  thouqh  the Native American  policy stated that outside  the \norison settinq  they are worn  dailv because  oolicv says  thev  can do  a  visual \ninsoection at any  time  for  security reasons  to soe  if contraband  is  inside. \n( 1) \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00013   Document 1   Filed on 01/10/14 in TXSD   Page 7 of 13\n(3)  TDCJ-CID  has  allowed  Prayer  Pipe  ceremonies  in their prison settinq  from \nMay  1996  up  to July 2012  and  then  took  them  away  from  the Native American \noractitioners.  These  Pioe ceremonies were  allowed per TDCJ-CID  poliy 09.01-09.04 \nof  the A.D  07.30 Chaplaincy Manual.  Means  TDCJ-CID  cannot  condone  a  communal \npipe due  to health  reasons,  then  Plaintiff request his own  personal  prayer  pipe \nas a  least restrictive means  under RLUIPA  so he may  practice his established \ntraditional pipe ceremonies  in which  his  tribe has  been doing  for  the past(2) \nTwo-Thousand  years.  TDCJ-CID  does  not  allow any  least restrictive means,  due  to \npolicies they enforce.  William stephens  is beinq  sued  in his official capacity \nfor  implementinq  policies that violate my  constitutional  riqhts  under RLUIPA \nunder  least restricitve means. \nClint Morris  is beinq  sued  in his  individual capacity for  first amendment \nviolation for  failure  to act accordinq  to his  iob discriotion in which  caused \nthe violation of mv  constitutional riahts  denying  Plaintiff the  riqht to \nhave  traditional Pipe  ceremonies  per TDCJ-CID  oolicies  in which  were  in effect \nat the  time he was  hired  in  2009  to oversee  the Native American  Units  and  make \nsure they had  their required ceremonies  before he  played a  personal  role  in \nchanging  the Native American  policy to which  led  to TDCJ-CID  stoppinq  pipe \nceremonies.  Orioinally the TDCJ-CID  offenders  could  smoke  the sacred  pipe \nper policy.  Now,  they are not afforded  the opportunity to smoke  the sacred  pipe \nany more  due  to the new  policy  in which  is a  violation of my  constitutional \nriqhts because  there  is no  least restrictive means  available  to me  so  I  can \npray traditionally.  From  the time period of  Sept.  2008  up  till Julv  2012  the \nPlaintiff has  not  had  his  pipe ceremonies  as was  in effect until Julv  2012 \nwhen  the  new  policy came  into effect. \nPlaintiff has  shown  three(3)  policies  in which  are  in effect that violate \nhis constitutional riahts under  RLTJIPA  under  the  least restrictive means,  and \nhow  he  is forcefully required  to cut his hair aqainst reliqious beliefs and \npractices or be sub-·iect  to  punishment  for  not  compl Yinq  to TDCJ-CID  oroominq \npolicies.  Plaintiff reauested  relief  is on  Paae#(3) \n( 2) \n\n• \nCase 2:14-cv-00013   Document 1   Filed on 01/10/14 in TXSD   Page 8 of 13\nPLAINTIFFS'  REQUESTED  RELIEF \nPlaintiff seeks a  declaratory  -judqement  and  in-junctive  relief aqainst TDCJ \nCID  prison system to allow Plaintiff to have  the  followinq:  (l)  his  lonq  hair/ \nor as a  least restricitve emans  a  Kouplock,  (2)  to be  able to wear  his medicine \nbaq  at all times,  (3)  and  to have his own  personal  prayer oioe to orav with as \na  least restrictive means  because TDCJ-CID  cannot any  lonqer condone a  communal \nprayer pipe  for  inmates  to smoke  due  to serious  life threatninq diseases  that \nthev have been exposed  to since 1998  N/A  POlicy was  implemented.  Under  RLUIPA \nthere has  to be a  least restrictive means  to orav to the Great soirit in which \nTDCJ-CID  has  not  shm-m  one  yet.  TDCJ  Native American  contract Chaplain stated \nthey cannot  release the  prayers of the offenders  from  the  pipe but can say a \nprayer on behalf of the  participants.  This  is why  it is clearly called personal \nprayers and  a  personal  prayer  pipe  is used.  The  participants have  to say and \nrelease  their own  personal  prayers  to be  heard  from  the qreat soirit so  their \noravers  can be heard and  answered.  Knowinq  that TDCJ  N/A  chaplains cannot \nrelease  the  Plaintiffs prayers because  they do  not know  them  is not aleast \nrestrictive means  of Plaintiffs traditional  beliefs and  practices. \nTo  deny  the  Plaintiff the riqht  to say his  prayers and  smoke  and  release his \nown  personal  praver is to deny  the Great SPirit  (GOD)  the  very riqht  to answer \nmy  prayer. \nPlaintiff seeks monetarv damaqes  aoainst Clint Morris  in his  indivinnal \ncnaacity for  violatinq my  constitutional  riqht by  personally Playinq  a  role \nin the new  oolicv chanoe  in which  now  prohibits  the Native  Americans  the \nrioht  to oersonallv smoke  and  release  their own  prayers.  Clint Morris'  own \nlOb  was  not  comlpied with  that he was  hired  to do,and  the  verv ommition  to \nthis non-compliance  to a  policy that was  in effect when  he  was  hired  to oversee \nthe Native American  communities  is what  caused  the violation of my  First Amendment \nriqhts.  Plaintiff seeks  not only the  requested  relief above,  but also any  other \nmonies  entitled to him  as well. \n( 3) \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00013   Document 1   Filed on 01/10/14 in TXSD   Page 9 of 13\nTexas Department of Criminal Justice  OFFICE USE ONLY \nffi~~.~\\Cy.l 1YL\\\\ \nGrievance#: \nSTEPl  OFFENDER  ~ ,}\\l\\;J \nDate Received: \nGRIEVANCE FORM  ht>\\   \n1'~'1  ~ \nDate Due:  . \n_,\\T-~U......;;.. \nGrievance Code: _  \\....,.,.---___  \n1  ~\\ lj\\J \nOffender Name:  11i J l i am  casei  TD·C·J: #: ·:6:E v18 09  Investigator ID #: \nUnit:  \\'/m.

Bradley, Clerk\nCORPUS CHRISTI DIVISION \n \nTEDDY NORRIS DAVIS, et al,  §  \n  §  \n              Plaintiffs,  §  \nVS.  §     CIVIL ACTION NO. 2:12-CV-166 \n  §  \nCLINT  MORRIS, et al,  §  \n  §  \n              Defendants.  §  \n \nOPINION AND ORDER DENYING WITHOUT PREJUDICE \nMOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL \n \n  Plaintiff Davis has  moved for appointment of counsel (D.E. 193).  The Fifth \nCircuit Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part the order granting summary \njudgment in favor of Defendants.  An order for additional briefing and evidence was \nentered July 12, 2016 as to Plaintiffs' claims pursuant to the Religious Land Use and \nInstitutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc (D.E. 192).  The case has \nnot yet been scheduled for trial. \n  In Bounds v. Smith, the Supreme Court held that a prisoner's constitutional right of \naccess to the courts requires that the access be meaningful; that is, prison officials must \nprovide pro se litigants with writing materials, access to the law library, or other forms of \nlegal assistance.  Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817, 829 (1977).  There is, however, no \nconstitutional right to appointment of counsel in civil rights cases.  Akasike v. Fitzpatrick, \n26 F.3d 510, 512 (5th Cir. 1994); Branch v. Cole, 686 F.2d 264, 266 (5th Cir. 1982).  \nFurther, Bounds did not create a \"free-standing right to a law library or legal assistance.\"  \nLewis v. Casey, 116 S. Ct. 2174, 2180 (1996).  It is within the court's discretion to \n1 / 3 \n\nappoint counsel, unless the case presents \"exceptional circumstances,\" thus requiring the \nappointment.  28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(1); Cupit v. Jones, 835 F.2d 82, 86 (5th Cir. 1987).  \n  A number of factors should be examined when determining whether to appoint \ncounsel.  Jackson v. Dallas Police Department, 811 F.2d 260, 261-62 (5th Cir. 1986) \n(citing Ulmer v. Chancellor, 691 F.2d 209 (5th Cir. 1982)).  The first is the type and \ncomplexity of the case.  Id.  This case is not overly complex.  Only Plaintiff's RLUIPA \nclaims remain for summary judgment and/or trial.  At this summary judgment stage, \nPlaintiff's allegations are serious but not complex. \n  The second and third factors are whether the plaintiff is in a position to adequately \ninvestigate and present his case.  Id.  Plaintiff’s pleadings demonstrate he is reasonably \narticulate and intelligent.  He has ably supported his claims before the Fifth Circuit Court \nof Appeals.  Plaintiff appears, at this stage of the case, to be in a position to adequately \ninvestigate and present his case.  \n  The fourth factor which should be examined is whether the evidence will consist \nin large part of conflicting testimony so as to require skill in the presentation of evidence \nand in cross-examination.  Id.  Examination of this factor is premature because the case \nhas not yet been set for trial.  \n  Finally, there is no indication that appointed counsel would aid in the efficient and \nequitable disposition of the case.  The Court has the authority to award attorneys' fees to a \nprevailing plaintiff.  42 U.S.C. § 1988.  Plaintiff is not prohibited from hiring an attorney \non a contingent-fee arrangement.  Plaintiff Davis's motion for appointment of counsel \n(D.E.  193)  is  denied  without  prejudice  at  this  time.    This  order  will  be  sua  sponte \n2 / 3 \n\nreexamined if this case is scheduled for trial after the summary judgment phase of the \ncase is completed. \n  ORDERED this 26th day of July, 2016. \n \n \n___________________________________ \nB.

Plaintiffs have filed a response\nin opposition.  (D.E. 57).  For the reasons stated herein, it is respectfully recommended that\ndefendant Morris’ motion to dismiss be granted in part, and denied in part, as set forth herein.\nI.  Background\nIn this prisoner civil rights action filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, plaintiffs Teddy\nNorris Davis and Robbie Dow Goodman allege that defendants have violated, and continue\nto violate, their right to practice their Native American religion, in violation of provisions of\nthe Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (“RLUPIA”), 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc,\nand the First Amendment. Plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief from the Texas\nDepartment of Criminal Justice, Criminal Institutions Division (“TDCJ-CID”) to: (1) hire\nmore Native American chaplains; (2) have security personnel available to supervise the\nNative American religious ceremonies until such time that more Native American chaplains\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 65   Filed on 11/16/12 in TXSD   Page 2 of 11\ncan be hired; (3) allow plaintiffs to grow their hair or allow them to grow a kouplock; (4)\nsmoke the ceremonial pipe at pipe ceremonies; and (5) wear their medicine bags at all times.\nPlaintiffs seek damages against certain individual defendants, including Clint Morris, for\nalleged violations of their First Amendment rights.  (D.E. 1, 16).  \nPlaintiffs have sued Clint Morris in both his individual and official capacities.  (D.E.\n16 at 2).  Plaintiffs identify Mr. Morris as the Program Analyst for Designated Units and\nclaim that he is responsible for: (1) monitoring and evaluating Native American programs\nat designated units; (2) recruiting volunteers and contracting with chaplains to conduct\nNative American ceremonies; and (3) developing policies and procedures that govern and\npromote the success and accessibility of Native American programs at designated units.\n(D.E. 57 at 5).  Plaintiff contend that Clint Morris failed to perform his job, and in so failing,\nviolated both RLUIPA and the First Amendment, because, under his watch, pipe ceremonies\nthat had been authorized by TDCJ-CID policy in 2008  were not conducted at the McConnell\nUnit,1 and that he failed to use his position to assist inmates in the practice of their faith. \nPlaintiffs note that  they last participated in a traditional pipe ceremony in 2008. \nOn August 27, 2012, Clint Morris filed his answer and raised the defense of qualified\nimmunity.  (D.E. 30). \nOn October 10, 2012, Mr. Morris filed the instant motion to dismiss.  (D.E. 51).  \n1 Effective July 2012, the TDCJ-CID now prohibits pipe ceremonies.\n2\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 65   Filed on 11/16/12 in TXSD   Page 3 of 11\nOn November 5, 2012, plaintiffs filed their response in opposition to the dismissal.\n(D.E. 57).\nII.  Motion to Dismiss\nIn support of his motion to dismiss, Mr. Morris has offered as evidence:\nEx. A: Affidavit of Clint Morris;\nEx. B: TDCJ Job Description for Program Analyst;\nEx. C: September 8, 2011 TDCJ Memorandum Regarding Native American\nIssues; and \nEx. D: Relevant portions of the 2012 TDCJ Chaplaincy Policy regarding Native\nAmerican  Religious Services.2\nIn his affidavit, Clint Morris states that he has been employed by the TDCJ since May,\n2009, and his current position title is “Program Supervisor III – Rehabilitation Programs\nAnalyst in the Rehabilitation Programs Division (RPD) – of the Texas Department of\nCriminal Justice.”  (RMD, Ex. A, Morris Aff’t at ¶ 1, ¶ 2).  He relates that his general\nresponsibilities include: monitor and evaluate Native American and Jewish programs  at\ndesignated units; recruitment of volunteers and contract chaplains for Native American and\nJewish programs; confer with RPD staff on program issues and to identify and implement\nsolutions; and to develop and draft policies and procedures under the direction of the RPD\nManager III – Services.  Id., Morris Aff’t  at ¶ 2.  He points out that he does not have the\n2 Reference to Morris’ motion to dismiss (D.E. 51), is to “DMD,” followed by an exhibit\nletter.  Reference to plaintiffs’ response, (D.E. 57), is to “PR,” followed by a page number.  \n3\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 65   Filed on 11/16/12 in TXSD   Page 4 of 11\nauthority to ratify or change any TDCJ  policies, procedures, or rules, and that, even if\nplaintiffs prevailed in their claims, he would not be able to implement the relief requested.\nId., Morris Aff’t  at ¶ 3. That is, he has no executive function.  Id., Morris Aff’t at ¶ 4.  (See\nalso DMD, Ex. B, TDCJ job description for Program Supervisor III).\nDefendant also offers in support of his motion to dismiss the minutes from a\nSeptember 8, 2011 meeting in which Mr. Morris, defendant Bill Pierce, and others were\npresent to discuss various issues concerning Native American ceremonies.  (RMD, Ex. C).\nIt was noted that pipe ceremonies were conducted at the Daniel Unit with a shared pipe, and\na discussion followed regarding medical and sanitation issues, and liability releases.  Id. at\n1 - 2.  Security issues were discussed, and it was noted that tobacco distributed for the pipe\nceremony at the Daniels Unit “kept disappearing.”  Id. at 2.  The group discussed personal\npipes for Native American offenders, but concluded personal pipes would create too great\nof a security concern and burden, and the cost was great.  Id. at 3.  It was noted that the\nCherokee Nation of Texas, the Lakota Nation and the Apache Nation were not interested  in\nassisting with the cost or donation of personal pipes as they believed the offenders had “lost\nthe right to take of the pipe.”  The group reached a consensus that there be: (1) no communal\noffender pipes; (2) no offender-owned or possessed pipes allowed; (3) no storage of\noffender-possessed pipes or pipe herbs by the TDCJ; and (4)  Native Americans be provided\nwith one pipe ceremony per month, with smoking to be done only by the volunteer/chaplain.\nId. at 4.\n4\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 65   Filed on 11/16/12 in TXSD   Page 5 of 11\nIn July 2012, the Chaplaincy Manual was revised to reflect changes concerning\nreligious devotional items.  (DMD Ex. D).   In summary, the policy, 05.01,  provides that an\noffender is permitted to possess only approved religious devotional items.  (RMD, Ex. D at\n1, Procedures, ¶ I.A).  Concerning medicine bags or pouches in particular, the policy\nprovides that an offender may possess one medicine bag or pouch, and that wearing of the\nitem “is limited to the offender’s cell or immediate bunk area in a dorm setting, and at\nreligious services.”  Id. at 4, ¶ I.D. \nIII.  Discussion\nDefendant Morris moves for dismissal of plaintiffs’ claims against him pursuant to\nRule 12(b)(1), and Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  He argues that a\nRule 12(b)(1) dismissal is appropriate regarding plaintiff’s claims against him in his official\ncapacity for monetary relief as such claims are barred by the Eleventh Amendment.  He\ncontends further that plaintiffs claims against him for injunctive relief are not available\nbecause, in his capacity as a program analyst, he does not have the authority to “act.” As to\nplaintiffs’ claims against him in his individual capacity, Morris argues that he is entitled to\ndismissal for failure to state a claim because he is entitled to qualified immunity.\nA. Eleventh Amendment.  \n1. Monetary damages and official capacity.\nA suit against a state actor in his or her official capacity for monetary damages is, for\nall intensive purposes, a suit against the state itself.

The Eleventh Amendment is a jurisdictional bar to a suit for money damages against\n5\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 65   Filed on 11/16/12 in TXSD   Page 6 of 11\na state.  Pennhurst State Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 100 (1984).  Indeed, the Fifth\nCircuit has repeatedly held that the Eleventh Amendment bars claims for money damages\nagainst TDCJ officers in their official capacities.  See e.g., Oliver v. Scott, 276 F.3d 736, 742\n(5th Cir. 2002).  Accordingly, to the extent plaintiffs are suing Clint Morris in his official\ncapacity for money damages, those claims are barred by the Eleventh Amendment, and\ntherefore, they are properly dismissed.\n2. Injunctive relief and official capacity.\nIt is well established that the Eleventh Amendment does not bar a plaintiff’s claim for\nprospective injunctive relief.  Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 159 (1908); Edelman v. Jordan,\n415 U.S. 651, 666-68 (1974) ; Green v. Mansour, 474 U.S. 64, 68 (1985).  However, for the\nEx parte Young exception to apply, the court must examine: (1) the ability of the official to\nenforce  the  statute  at  issue  under  his  statutory  or  constitutional  power,  and  (2)  the\ndemonstrated willingness of the official to enforce the statute.  Okpalobi v. Foster, 244 F.3d\n405, 425-27 (5th Cir. 2001).  That is, “the necessary fiction of Young requires that the\ndefendant state official be acting, threatening to act, or at least have the ability to act.”\nOkpalobi, 244 F.3d at 405.  The Fifth Circuit has noted that a state official cannot be\nenjoined to act in any way that is beyond his authority to act in the first place.  Id. at 427. \nMr. Morris’ authority in his official capacity is limited to the responsibilities set forth\nin his job description.  (See DMD, Ex. A, Morris Aff’t at ¶ 3; Ex. B).  His responsibilities do\nnot include amending or ratifying TDCJ policy.  That is, even should plaintiffs prevail under\nRLUIPA and establish that the TDCJ must provide monthly ceremonial pipe ceremonies,\n6\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 65   Filed on 11/16/12 in TXSD   Page 7 of 11\nor allow offenders to wear a kouplock, or any other requested injunctive relief, the proper\nofficial to implement this change will be Rick Thaler, as TDCJ Executive Director.   Indeed,\nit was specifically discussed at the evidentiary hearing that Rick Thaler was the necessary\ndefendant to enforce any prospective injunctive relief.  Thus, it is respectfully recommended\nthat plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive relief against defendant Morris be dismissed.  \nB. First Amendment claims against Morris in his individual capacity.\nPlaintiffs are suing Mr. Morris in his individual capacity for monetary damages for\nalleged violations of their First Amendment rights.  Plaintiffs argue that Mr. Morris arrived\nat the McConnell Unit in May 2009, and at that time, pipe ceremonies were in fact authorized\nby TDCJ policy.  Plaintiffs contend that Mr. Morris failed to perform or authorize the very\nresponsibilities he was hired by the TDCJ to perform, effectively denying plaintiffs their\nright to practice their religion as provided by the First Amendment. Defendant Morris seeks\nto dismiss plaintiffs’ claims on the grounds that they have failed to raise a constitutional\nviolation and argues that his actions were objectively reasonable, such that he is entitled to\nqualified immunity.   \nAlthough  Rule 12(b)(6) authorizes a defendant to move to dismiss a complaint for\n“failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted,” the district court must construe\nthe complaint in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, and the allegations contained therein\nmust be taken as true.  Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93-94 (2007).   To survive a motion\nto dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to “state a\nclaim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009),\n7\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 65   Filed on 11/16/12 in TXSD   Page 8 of 11\nciting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007).  In the context of a\ndefendant’s motion to dismiss, the district court’s review is limited to the allegations in the\ncomplaint and to those documents attached to a defendant's motion to dismiss to the extent\nthat those documents are referred to in the complaint and are central to the claims.  Causey\nv. Sewell Cadillac-Chevrolet, Inc., 394 F.3d 285, 288 (5th Cir.2004). “If, based on the facts\npleaded and judicially noticed, a successful affirmative defense appears, then dismissal under\nRule 12(b)(6) is proper.”  Hall v. Hodgkins, No. 08-40516, 2008 WL 5352000, *3 (5th Cir.\n2008).\nPlaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts that, if true, state a First Amendment claim for\ndenial of their right to practice their Native American religion against defendant Mr. Morris.\nPlaintiffs have alleged that Mr. Morris was in charge of volunteers and chaplains, yet they\nhave not had a pipe ceremony since 2008.  Although the July 2012 policy may now prohibit\nsuch pipe ceremonies, the prohibition was not in effect in May 2009 when Mr. Morris\nassumed his responsibilities as program analyst, and ceremonies could have been conducted\nuntil July 2012.  Moreover, by his own admission, Morris participated in the discussion\nwhich led to a change in TDCJ policy.3  Plaintiffs argue that Mr. Morris should be an\nadvocate for their rights, but has failed to do so.  Although additional information may\nestablish that Mr. Morris’ actions are objectively reasonable and that he is entitled to\n3It does not appear that plaintiffs were aware of the July 2012 change in policy.  Should\nplaintiffs wish to amend their complaint to add a claim that the new policy is unconstitutional\nand violates RLUIPA, it would make sense and would conserve judicial resources to litigate\nsuch claims in this lawsuit.\n8\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 65   Filed on 11/16/12 in TXSD   Page 9 of 11\nqualified immunity, a Rule12(b)(6) motion is not the proper vehicle to address that defense.\nThus, it is respectfully recommended that defendant Morris’ motion to dismiss plaintiff’s\nFirst Amendment claims against him in his individual capacity be denied.\nIV. Motion for Rule 7(a) Reply\nAlternatively defendant Morris moves for the court to order a Rule 7(a) Reply. \nRule 7(a) of  the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes the district court to “order a\nreply to an answer.”   The Fifth Circuit has held en banc that an individual defendant who\npleads immunity to a federal civil action is entitled to have the plaintiff ordered to reply\nunder Rule 7.  Schultea v. Wood, 47 F.3d 1427, 1433 (5th Cir. 1995) (en banc).  The\nSchultea Court stated:\nSuch an order will require the Plaintiff to reply to that\n[immunity] defense in detail.  By definition, the reply must be\ntailored to the assertion of qualified immunity and fairly\nengage its allegations... . [The] Plaintiff [must] support his\nclaim with sufficient precision and factual specificity to raise\na genuine issue as to the illegality of the defendant’s conduct\nat the time of the alleged acts.  \nId., 47 F.3d at 1434.  “A plaintiff cannot overcome a qualified immunity defense with\nmere conclusory allegations [but] must plead specific facts with sufficient particularity ...\nto negate the defense of qualified immunity.”  Burns-Toole v. Byrne, 11 F.3d 1270, 1274,\ncert. denied, 512 U.S. 1207 (1994) (citing Elliott v. Perez, 751 F.2d 1472, 1479, 1482 (5th\nCir. 1985)).  As set forth above, plaintiffs have plead sufficient facts to pursue their\nconstitutional claims and to overcome the qualified immunity defense at this stage of the\n9\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 65   Filed on 11/16/12 in TXSD   Page 10 of 11\nlitigation.  Defendant Morris may seek discovery from plaintiffs, if necessary, to pursue\nhis summary judgment motion on qualified immunity.\nV.  Recommendation  \nFor the reasons stated above, it is respectfully recommended that the Court grant in\npart, and deny in part, defendant Morris’ motion to dismiss (D.E. 51), as follows:\n(1) Plaintiffs’ claims for monetary damages against Mr. Morris in his official\ncapacity be dismissed as barred by the Eleventh Amendment;\n(2) Plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive relief against Mr. Morris in his individual\ncapacity be dismissed because he has no authority to grant the relief requested;\nand\n(3) Plaintiffs’ claims for money damages against  Mr. Morris in his individual\ncapacity alleging that he violated their First Amendment rights be retained.\nIt is further recommended that defendant’s alternative motion for a Rule 7(a) reply be\ndenied because plaintiffs have provided sufficient detail for defendant Morris to understand\nand defend the claims against him.\nRespectfully submitted this 16th day of November, 2012.\n____________________________________\n B.

Bradley, Clerk\nCORPUS CHRISTI DIVISION \n \nROBBIE DOW GOODMAN, et al,  §  \n  §  \n              Plaintiffs,  §  \nVS.  §     CIVIL ACTION NO. 2:12-CV-166 \n  §  \nLORIE DAVIS, et al,  §  \n  §  \n              Defendants.  §  \n \nFINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW \nPlaintiffs Robbie Dow Goodman (Goodman), William Casey (Casey), and Raymond \nCobb (Cobb) filed this action against Lorie Davis in her official capacity as Director of the \nTexas Department of Criminal Justice-Correctional Institutions Division (TDCJ).1  Plaintiffs \nseek injunctive relief to require TDCJ to grant them an exemption from its male inmate hair \ngrooming  policy  so  that  they  may  grow  their  hair  long,  consistent  with  their  Native \nAmerican religious beliefs.  The case was tried to the bench on August 29 to 31, 2018.  \nHaving considered the pleadings of the parties, evidence, and arguments of counsel, the \nCourt makes the following findings of fact and conclusions of law, GRANTING Plaintiffs’ \nrequested relief. \nA. Rubric and Standard of Review \nPlaintiffs bring this case pursuant to the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized \nPersons Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000-cc-1 (RLUIPA).  Congress enacted RLUIPA to provide \n                                            \n1   A lawsuit against a governmental official in her official capacity is a suit against the state office she serves.  E.g., \nMonell v. Dep't of Soc. Servs. of City of New York, 436 U.S. 658, 690 n.55 (1978).  For ease of reference, Defendant \nwill be referred to herein as TDCJ.  \n \n1 / 23 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 322   Filed on 01/24/19 in TXSD   Page 2 of 23\nbroad protection for religious liberty.   Holt v. Hobbs, 135 S. Ct. 853, 859 (2015).  It \nprovides that “[n]o government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise \nof a person residing in or confined to an institution . . . even if the burden results from a rule \nof general applicability, unless the government demonstrates that imposition of the burden \non that person—(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the \nleast restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.” 42 U.S.C. § \n2000cc-1.  RLUIPA protections are expansive and are to be construed broadly to favor the \nmaximum religious liberty appropriate in an institutional setting.  Holt, 135 S. Ct. at 860.  \nThere are two phases to the adjudication of a RLUIPA claim.  First, Plaintiffs bear \nthe burden of proving that the TDCJ-CID policy implicates the exercise of a sincerely held \nreligious belief and substantially burdens that exercise.  Holt, 135 S. Ct. at 862 (citing § \n2000cc–5(7)(A)).  Plaintiffs testified that they had long practiced a form of Native American \nreligion, which requires them to grow their hair long.  Among other things, they testified \nthat their hair is considered an extension of their souls, is only to be cut when in mourning, \nand is essential to being recognized and accepted by their ancestors in the afterlife.  The \nTDCJ policy requires Plaintiffs to cut their hair short on a regular basis, without reference to \nany life event or cause for mourning.  The policy clearly requires them to engage in conduct \nthat violates their religious beliefs.   \nFailure to comply with the grooming policy will result in significant disciplinary \naction, a scenario that satisfies Plaintiffs’ burden of proof to demonstrate a substantial \nburden on their exercise of religion.  TDCJ has stipulated that Plaintiffs have met their \n2 / 23 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 322   Filed on 01/24/19 in TXSD   Page 3 of 23\nburden of proof on the initial phase of the inquiry. D.E. 281 at 3, 7.  Therefore, this case \nfocuses only on the second phase of the RLUIPA inquiry.   \nIn the second phase, the burden of proof shifts to TDCJ to show that its refusal to \nallow  Plaintiffs  to  grow  long  hair  (1)  is  in  furtherance  of  a  compelling  governmental \ninterest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental \ninterest.  Id. at 863 (quoting § 2000cc–1(a)).  Under RLUIPA, this inquiry is plaintiff-\nspecific, requiring the Court to focus on the application of the challenged policy to the \nparticular claimant whose religious exercise has been burdened.  Id. at 863.  The argument \nthat an exemption in a particular case will lead to other exemptions was rejected by the \nSupreme  Court  in  Holt  as  “another  formulation  of  the  classic  rejoinder  of  bureaucrats \nthroughout history:  If I make an exception for you, I'll have to make one for everybody, so \nno exceptions.”  Id. at 866 (internal quotation marks omitted).   \nThe  Court  should  give  appropriate  respect  to  the  expertise  of  prison  officials.  \nHowever, this does not call for unquestioning deference.  Id. at 864.  The Court is free to \ndisregard testimony of prison experts where there is conflicting evidence.  Ali v. Stephens, \n822 F.3d 776, 789 (5th Cir. 2016).  This is especially true where conflicting testimony \ncomes from the TDCJ’s own witnesses. Id.  And any prison official’s testimony may be \ntested against the policies and practices of other prison systems to see whether a persuasive \nreason exists to deny a religious accommodation.  Holt, 135 S. Ct. at 866. \n3 / 23 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 322   Filed on 01/24/19 in TXSD   Page 4 of 23\nB. The Policy \nTDCJ’s male grooming policy requires Plaintiffs to cut their hair, violating their \nreligious beliefs and prohibiting the religious practice of wearing long hair.  The policy \nstates: \nMale offenders shall keep their hair trimmed up the back of their \nneck and head.  Hair shall be neatly  cut.   Hair shall be cut \naround the ears.  Sideburns shall not extend below the middle of \nthe  ears.    No  block  style,  afro,  or  shag  haircuts  shall  be \npermitted.  No fad or extreme hairstyles/haircuts are allowed.  \nNo mohawks, tails, or designs cut into the hair are allowed. \nD.E. 281 at 3.  Plaintiffs seek an exception to allow them to wear long, unbraided, loose hair \nin accordance with their religious beliefs.  However, Defendant makes no exception for \nmale inmates who seek to wear long hair on religious grounds.  D.E. 281 at 4. \nIn  contrast,  TDCJ  allows  all  female  inmates  to  wear  their  hair  without  length \nrestrictions. D.E. 281 at 4.  The reason TDCJ allows women to have long hair is because it \nviews women having long hair as an accepted cultural norm.  TDCJ conceded that the \ndisparity in the male and female grooming policies is not connected to any difference in the \npropensity for violence, to smuggle contraband, or to facilitate proper hygiene between men \nand women. \nWith  respect  to  county  jails  in  Texas,  the  Texas  Administrative  Code  contains \nstandards  for  correctional  facilities.    The  Texas  Commission  on  Jail  Standards’  policy \nallows county jail inmates to wear long hair and only permits the jail to require a haircut \nwhen “clearly justified for health or sanitary reasons.” 37 Tex. Admin. Code § 277.7.  This \nis consistent with the industry standard of incarceration throughout the country.  The vast \n4 / 23 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 322   Filed on 01/24/19 in TXSD   Page 5 of 23\nmajority of jurisdictions in the United States allow male inmates to have long hair.  D.E. \n281 at 5.  Only eight states in the United States ban male inmates from having long hair:  \nAlabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia. Id. \nC. Plaintiffs’ Expert, Joan Palmateer \nPlaintiffs offered the testimony of Joan Palmateer as an expert.  She began her 32-\nyear career as a correctional officer in the Oregon Department of Corrections and worked \nher  way  up  in  the  system  through  positions  involving  mentoring,  training,  and  policy \nformation.  She wrote post orders that instructed correctional officers and prison staffers on \nhow to perform their daily work, including how often they search inmates, how often they \nperform  counts, and  how to respond to emergencies.   She rose through the ranks and \nbecame an assistant superintendent, taking charge of different types of prison facilities. \nEventually, Ms. Palmateer became Chief of Security for the Oregon Department of \nCorrections, with statewide authority.  She then became warden of the Oregon State Men’s \nPenitentiary,  a  super-max  prison  that  included  death  row,  administrative  segregation,  a \nmental health facility, as well as general population.  Later, she had an opportunity to open a \nnew women’s prison and male intake facility where she was able to define the prison culture \nby  selecting  her  own  staff  and  establishing  parameters  for  all  of  the  operations  from \ninception.    Upon  being  promoted  to  the  central  office  as  Administrator,  she  began \nsupervising all superintendents and wardens in the Oregon Department of Corrections.  She \nhelped write the curriculum for training new wardens and superintendents on all things they \nneed to know in the first six months of assuming their respective leadership positions.   \n5 / 23 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 322   Filed on 01/24/19 in TXSD   Page 6 of 23\nIn connection with her associated work for the National Institute of Corrections, \nAdministrator Palmateer created security audit policies and standards, the instruments used \nto conduct security audits, and audit training for her department.  A security audit is a total \nrisk assessment for an institution within an agency.  She personally performed audits of \nprisons in forty-eight states.  She also conducted staffing assessments and critical incident \nreviews.    The  Court  accepted  Administrator  Palmateer  as  an  expert  in  prison  industry \nstandards, prison administration generally, and prison security specifically, including health \nissues, budgetary matters, and inmate identification. \nThroughout Administrator Palmateer’s work, the Oregon prisons allowed both male \nand female inmates to wear long hair.  She is personally familiar with multiple state policies \nand the security status of their prisons—both those that allow and those that do not allow \nmale prisoners to wear long hair.  And while she never before testified on behalf of an \ninmate,  she  agreed  to  testify  in  this  case  because  she  understands  from  her  personal \nexperience and expertise that the ability to practice a religious faith is important to the \ncorrection system’s goal of rehabilitation of inmates.  The practice of a religion causes \ninmates to actively engage in an activity that is both meaningful and provides perspective.  \nShe testified clearly and confidently, such that the Court deems her testimony to be highly \ncredible and authoritative. \nD. Compelling Governmental Interest. \nDefendant argues that the TDCJ male grooming policy is necessary to further the \nfollowing governmental interests:  preventing the smuggling of contraband; eliminating a \nmeans to commit suicide or perpetrate violence; preventing an escaped inmate from easily \n6 / 23 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 322   Filed on 01/24/19 in TXSD   Page 7 of 23\nchanging his appearance; reducing incidents of adverse health and sanitation issues; and \ncontrolling budgetary costs associated with frequent inmate searches.  The evidence did not \nsupport those arguments in the abstract or with respect to Plaintiffs.  TDCJ’s claims are \nfurther undercut by the underinclusive nature of its male grooming policy as compared to \nthe female grooming policy and TDCJ’s allowance of other religious exemptions that are \nmore troubling than long hair. \n1.  Smuggling Contraband \nTDCJ claims that long hair is conducive to smuggling contraband.  However, it has \nnot tracked such incidents or maintained any statistics to support its claim, despite the six \nand one-half-year pendency of this case.  Although long hair is permitted among female \ninmates and female inmates are known to smuggle items at higher rates than men, TDCJ has \nnot shown how often—if at all—long hair has been found to facilitate contraband smuggling \nwithin that population.  Instead, TDCJ Director Lorie Davis testified that she has never seen \ncontraband in loose, long hair, and the only contraband she has seen in braided hair was \nnon-dangerous or “nuisance” contraband.   \nThis is consistent with the testimony of Administrator Palmateer, who stated that \nprisons allowing long hair do  not have higher instances of smuggling contraband  than \nprisons  that  prohibit  long  hair.    She  testified  that  inmates  prefer  hiding  places  where \ncontraband can be more easily and securely hidden, such as in clothing, on the body, in \nbody cavities, or inside other objects such as books.  As a result, inmates do not generally \nsmuggle contraband in long hair, especially in the loose hair at issue here. \n7 / 23 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 322   Filed on 01/24/19 in TXSD   Page 8 of 23\nTDCJ offered no factual substance to support its claim that loose, long hair facilitates \nsmuggling.    In  addition,  TDCJ  does  not,  in  practice,  treat  hair-related  smuggling  as  a \nproblem compelling a solution.  Even though male and female inmates are equally capable \nof smuggling the same dangerous contraband, female inmates are permitted to wear long \nhair,  including  braids.    TDCJ  Director  Melodye  Nelson  admitted  that  she  even  allows \nfemale inmates with a known pattern of smuggling contraband to wear long hair.   \nTDCJ allows various religious exemptions to their policies that provide the same or \nmore significant opportunities to smuggle contraband, such as growing beards and wearing \nkufis or hijabs.  TDCJ also freely allows inmates to carry religious texts such as the Bible or \nKoran around the prison despite the fact that those books are a better hiding place, are more \nfrequently used for smuggling contraband, can accommodate larger and more dangerous \nitems,  and  take  longer  to  search.    And  TDCJ  does  not  revoke  religious  text-carrying \nprivileges even after an inmate uses one to smuggle contraband.  \nTDCJ has not demonstrated that its grooming policy furthers any compelling interest \nof the government to prevent the smuggling of contraband.   \n2.  Perpetrating Violence \nTDCJ advances three reasons that long hair creates risks of personal injury or death.  \nFirst, it claims that long hair can be used by an inmate to commit suicide.  Second, long hair \ncould be used as a way to hold on to an opponent in a struggle, thus facilitating violent \nconfrontations and increasing injuries among inmates.  Third, creating a religious privilege \nof wearing long hair would engender jealousy and foment more fights targeting Plaintiffs. \n8 / 23 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 322   Filed on 01/24/19 in TXSD   Page 9 of 23\nSuicide.  Neither of the industry experts who testified were aware of anyone using \nlong hair to commit suicide.  TDCJ produced one witness, Director Nelson, who testified \nthat in over ten years of supervising 8,000 female inmates, she is aware of one instance \nwhere long hair played a role in an attempted suicide.  The attempt was unsuccessful.  And \nTDCJ still allows female inmates to wear long hair.  \nFighting  Advantage.    According  to  the  evidence,  in  facilities  that  permit  male \ninmates to wear long hair, men have no track record of hair-pulling in their fights.  Rather, it \nis female inmates who are known to use hair to their advantage.  Despite this unquantified, \nyet greater incidence of the violent use of hair among females, females may wear long hair \nin TDCJ facilities.   \nTDCJ’s own witness, Director Nelson, admitted that TDCJ has not observed or made \nany effort to document a correlation between hair length and violence.  TDCJ does not \nrequire even the most violent of women to cut their hair.  This comports with Administrator \nPalmateer’s testimony that allowing long hair does not cause increased violence or injuries \nin prison.  States that allow long hair have not experienced any such association.  Neither \ndoes pulling hair cause greater injury than other forms of fighting that already exist in \nprison.  Indeed, TDCJ has other rehabilitative programs that it continues, even though the \nprograms  pose  greater  dangers  and  costs,  such  as  the  craft  shop  that  grants  access  to \ndangerous tools or outdoor work that increases the risk of smuggling dangerous contraband.  \nJealousy.  There are many classifications in prison that carry privileges, including \nthe  basic  security  classifications  that  determine  job  assignments  and  access  to  prison \nfacilities.  TDCJ is required to grant exemptions—privileges—to certain inmates for issues \n9 / 23 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 322   Filed on 01/24/19 in TXSD   Page 10 of 23\nof grooming, dress, and spiritual practice mandated by RLUIPA.  There is no evidence that \nthese existing exemptions cause jealousy and Plaintiffs testified credibly that their requested \nexemption from the grooming policy would not engender jealousy.  For example, Muslim \ninmates are allowed to observe their religious beliefs by wearing a beard, kufi, or a hijab.  \nInmates understand that they are not entitled to exemptions for religions that they do not \npractice and that they are entitled to their own religious exemptions to which others might \nnot be entitled.  \nSummation.  None of the reasons TDCJ proffers for resisting Plaintiff’s request to \nwear long hair based on suicide or an increase in violence or injury is supported by the \nrecord evidence. \n3.  Escape and Identification \nTDCJ  asserts  that  the  grooming  policy  is  important  to  providing  uniformity  in \nappearance, preventing escape, and expediting recapture in the event of an escape.  Long \nhair, it argues, makes identification within the prison more difficult and makes it easier for \nan escaped inmate to alter his appearance.  The credible evidence does not support these \narguments. \nPrison Identification.  A male inmate having long hair does not make him more \ndifficult to identify in prison.  Instead, the rarity of long hair among male populations where \nlong hair is permitted makes identification easier, not harder.  It would not be more difficult \nto identify an inmate with long hair than it would be to identify an inmate with other \npermitted exemptions such as a beard, kufi, or hijab.  And while TDCJ claims that short hair \nfor  male  inmates  is  necessary  for  uniformity,  TDCJ  does  not  pursue  this  alleged \n10 / 23 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 322   Filed on 01/24/19 in TXSD   Page 11 of 23\ngovernmental interest in female facilities.  TDCJ does not require any uniformity of haircuts \namong women.  \nEscape.  Successful escape attempts, where inmates escape the outer walls of the \nprison, are very rare.  In that rare case, the inmate’s success depends on a number of \ncomplex factors.  The inmate’s appearance, including altering that appearance, is rarely one \nof the factors that contributes to escape.  Even then, the length of a prisoner’s hair is a much \nless significant part of their appearance than other parts, such as clothing, glasses, and facial \nhair.  Critical incident audits reflect that staff complacency and a lack of supervision or \nmonitoring, rather than discreet policies, are at fault in prison homicides, escapes, and riots. \nBoth Administrator Palmateer and Director Nelson testified that long hair does not \nassist an inmate in escaping prison.  In fact, prisons that allow long hair do not have more \nescapes than prisons that prohibit long hair.  And TDCJ, itself, does not require women who \nhave escaped or attempted to escape to cut their hair.  \nRecapture.  In the rare case where an inmate is able to escape, the inmate is almost \nalways recaptured.  There  is no credible  evidence  that inmates  delay capture or evade \ncapture based on having long hair in prison and cutting it after escape.  Moreover, any threat \nof an escaped inmate not matching their wanted poster because they cut their hair can be \nremedied by requiring inmates to take multiple photos with long and short hair or imitating \nshort hair by pulling the hair back when the photo is taken.  TDCJ already takes updated \nphotographs of all inmates every 3 years.  Wanted posters with side-by-side photos of \nescaped inmates with short and long hair are the industry standard response. \n11 / 23 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 322   Filed on 01/24/19 in TXSD   Page 12 of 23\nTDCJ’s  reasons  for  imposing  a  short  hair  policy  on  men  in  order  to  make \nidentification easier or to prevent escape and assist recapture are not supported by the \nevidence.  In similar situations, courts have rejected the assertion that grooming policies aid \nin escape or avoiding recapture. See Holt, 135 S. Ct. at 864-65; Ali, 822 F.3d at 790. The \nvast majority of prisons allow male inmates to have long hair without an increase in escapes \nor longer periods of avoiding recapture, and TDCJ does not show any compelling reason \nwhy Texas is or would be different.  \n4.  Health and Sanitation \nTDCJ complains that long hair is an invitation to lice outbreaks and other undefined \nchallenges to sanitation.  However, prisons that allow long hair do not have more problems \nwith disease or general sanitation than prisons that prohibit long hair.  In particular, lice \noutbreaks are fairly rare, occurring primarily in intake units.  The McConnell unit is not an \nintake unit.  And prisons have effective systems in place for dealing with lice.  In practice, \nTDCJ does not treat the risk of head lice as a reason to require female inmates to cut their \nhair—even when they suffer from it.  \nThe evidence does not support TDCJ’s claim that its male grooming policy furthers \nthe government’s interest in the health of the inmates. \n5.  Budget and Inmate Searches \nTDCJ complains that long hair increases the time it takes to search prisoners.  And \nbecause the security of the prison requires frequent searches as inmates move around the \nfacility, the incremental increase in search time quickly adds up and creates significant \nstaffing issues in a system that is already understaffed.  TDCJ has overstated the problem. \n12 / 23 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 322   Filed on 01/24/19 in TXSD   Page 13 of 23\nThis case is addressing the request of only three inmates.  If TDCJ relies on the \nalleged burden posed by other inmates, it has not supported its position with any estimate \nregarding how many inmates might request a long hair exemption as practitioners of the \nNative American faith or any other faith that calls for wearing long hair.  At the time of trial, \nthere were 5,617 inmates identifying as Native American in the entire TDCJ population of \napproximately 148,000, which is less than four percent of the prison population.  The TDCJ \ntestimony did not break down how many Native Americans are female and not subject to a \nshort hair grooming policy or how many are housed in the McConnell unit, which can house \n2,750 inmates.   \nTDCJ did not do any polling of how many males might seek to practice the faith and \nwear long hair in the future.  In fact, the evidence was that the number of inmates practicing \nthe Native American faith in prison is small, with even fewer attending services.  The \nambient climate of the McConnell Unit, which is not air conditioned in the South Texas \nsummer, is also a natural disincentive to wearing long hair and might affect the number of \nmen who opt to claim their exemption. \nTo assess the economic burden of searching long hair, TDCJ sought to show how \nmuch additional time it takes to search inmates wearing long hair.  The credible evidence \nindicated that searching long hair takes three to ten seconds, as it involves requiring the \ninmate to shake his hair out while running his hands through it.  However, according to \nAdministrator Palmateer, it is not appropriate to isolate discreet parts of a search and assign \nthem separate blocks of time.  Searching is, instead, an integrated process that would not \nrequire additional staffing.  Inmates can be required to prepare their hair (if it has been \n13 / 23 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 322   Filed on 01/24/19 in TXSD   Page 14 of 23\nbraided or put up) as they line up for search, such that the preparation time does not increase \nthe search time.  Searching long, loose hair is not difficult and can easily be incorporated \ninto the structure of existing search types and the existing duties of correctional officers and \ntheir training.  \nTDCJ already requires both male and female inmates to bend forward and back and \nrun their fingers through their hair in an ordinary search.  And training on how to search \nlong  hair  on  male  inmates  can  be  easily  incorporated  into  TDCJ’s  regular,  frequently \nconducted training sessions for correctional officers.  The searches associated with long hair \nwill  not  require  the  hiring  of  additional  security  officers  or  the  purchase  of  expensive \nequipment.  Nor would processing applications for the long hair exemption cause significant \nadditional expense because TDCJ already employs clerks at the McConnell unit to process \nreligious exemptions such as these, as required by law.   \nAny budgetary cost would be the same or less than other religious accommodations \nthat TDCJ has allowed.  For instance, Christians, which make up a much larger portion of \nthe population than Native Americans, are permitted to carry a Bible, which takes more time \nto search than long, loose hair.  Likewise, there is no credible evidence that more inmates \n(or even the same number of inmates) would request a long-hair exemption than have \nrequested a beard exemption, which the TDCJ has already successfully allowed without \nsignificant budgetary, health, or safety costs.  There is no evidence that the exemption \nPlaintiffs seek would pose greater costs than the beard exemption. \nMany of the jurisdictions that allow long hair have the same or less money to spend \nper inmate than Texas.  By way of example, Nevada, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kentucky, \n14 / 23 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 322   Filed on 01/24/19 in TXSD   Page 15 of 23\nIndiana, Idaho, Missouri, South Dakota, and Utah have the same or fewer resources on a \nper-capita basis than Texas.  Texas does not have a lower inmate-to-guard ratio, nor is it \notherwise more understaffed, than other states.  And female facilities are not staffed at a \nhigher level than male facilities on the basis that searching long hair takes more time. \nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, there is no evidence that states that allow long \nhair and have a higher budget per inmate spend more money to accommodate the grooming \npolicy.  To the contrary, industry experts on both sides indicated that there are no increased \ncosts based on a policy allowing long hair and no saved costs based on a policy requiring \nshort hair.   Instead of a difference in staffing ratios, those jurisdictions tend to spend their \nfunds on increased salaries and expenses.  There is no competent evidence that the size and \ngeography of Texas provides unique challenges with respect to searching long hair that \nrequires additional funds. \nEven if TDCJ were to incur some amount of cost differential to permit long hair, that, \nby itself, does not satisfy the TDCJ’s burden of proof to show a compelling state interest.  \n“Congress stated that RLUIPA ‘may require a government to incur expenses in its own \noperations to avoid imposing a substantial burden on religious exercise.’”  Holt, 135 S. Ct. \nat 860, 866 (quoting § 2000cc–3(c)) and rejecting the argument that an exemption should be \ndenied because of the large number of inmates who might claim it). \nTDCJ has not met its burden to show that its male grooming policy furthers the \ngovernment’s interest in reducing the time and cost associated with inmate searches. \n15 / 23 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 322   Filed on 01/24/19 in TXSD   Page 16 of 23\n6.  Underinclusiveness Defeats Compelling Interest \nTDCJ’s evidence does not support the compelling interests it claimed in defending its \ngrooming policy.  Part of the calculus, noted above, is that its claims are eroded by the fact \nthat its policy is underinclusive.  \nA policy is underinclusive if it fails to cover significant tracts of \nconduct  implicating  its  animating  and  putatively  compelling \ninterest.  If a policy is underinclusive, this fact can raise with it \nthe  inference  that  the  government’s  claimed  interest  isn’t \nactually  so  compelling  after  all.    Underinclusive-ness  is \nproblematic because a law cannot be regarded as protecting a \ncompelling interest when it leaves appreciable damage to that \nsupposedly  vital  interest  unprohibited.    If  a  policy  is \nunderinclusive, the prison must provide an adequate explanation \nfor its differential treatment in order to avoid the conclusion that \nthe policy does not serve a compelling interest.  \nWare v. Louisiana Dep't of Corr., 866 F.3d 263, 268–69 (5th Cir. 2017), cert. denied, 138 S. \nCt. 1181 (2018) (citations, quotation marks, brackets, and ellipses omitted). \nAs noted in discussing each of TDCJ’s claims to a compelling interest, above, the \nmale grooming policy is underinclusive in that female inmates are not subject to the same \nshort-hair policy—despite their own capacity for smuggling, violence, escape, contracting \nlice, and even greater search requirements, given that they are not required to wear long hair \nin  a  loose  style.    The  only  explanation  given  for  this  divergent  treatment  is  the \naccommodation of social norms.  TDCJ did not provide any evidence that its interest in \nperpetuating social norms also served any penological interest or neutralized the concerns \nthat it claims animates its male grooming policy. \nThe policy is also underinclusive in that concerns regarding violence, smuggling, and \nmisidentification that counsel against other religious exemptions have not prevented those \n16 / 23 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 322   Filed on 01/24/19 in TXSD   Page 17 of 23\nexemptions, such as TDCJ’s allowance of beards, kufis, and hijabs.  TDCJ also invoked \nsocial norms to justify allowing religious texts, which not only provide a better means for \nsmuggling dangerous weapons and take longer to search, but can themselves be used as \nweapons.  The evidence shows that those religious accommodations present a greater risk to \nprison security, but they are permitted.  TDCJ did not attempt to explain why those religious \nexemptions were acceptable while long, loosely-worn hair is not. \nThe evidence also shows that Texas does not require that its jails follow the same \nmale grooming policy used in its prisons, even though the state has the power to do so.  \nThere is nothing in the record about the difference between jails and prisons that justifies \nthis disparity.  In particular, these three Plaintiffs spent many months or years in Texas jails \nprior to transferring to TDCJ prisons, and were allowed to wear long hair during their \nrespective  jail  incarcerations  without  incident.    Defendant’s  hair  policy  is,  therefore, \nunderinclusive for this additional reason.  See Ware, 866 F.3d at 270 (policy underinclusive \nwhere it did not apply equally in jails and prisons). \nIn all of these ways, TDCJ’s male grooming policy is underinclusive.  TDCJ has \nfailed to explain why its deference to social norms is appropriate in the prison setting and \noverrides the penological interests it claims.  \n7.  These Plaintiffs \nThe request of these three Plaintiffs does not present any particular danger to TDCJ’s \norder or security.  The Plaintiffs’ age, health, disciplinary histories, and prior experience of \nincarceration with long hair in Texas jails show they are not at significant risk of smuggling \n17 / 23 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 322   Filed on 01/24/19 in TXSD   Page 18 of 23\ncontraband, perpetrating violence, attempting escape, contracting lice, or holding up search \nlines. \nTDCJ separates inmates into five different custody levels based on the security risk \nof each inmate. Plaintiffs are each G2 custody inmates, which is the second lowest security \nrisk group status.  TDCJ uses its custody designation in determining various freedoms and \nprivileges offered to each inmate.  Inmates that are violent or that commit major disciplinary \ninfractions are moved into a higher custody level.  Because Plaintiffs are classified as G2, \nTDCJ has granted them significantly more privileges and freedoms than inmates of higher \nclassifications, including freedom of movement throughout the prison, access to more types \nof employment, and the ability to live in dorms.  \nPlaintiff Casey.  Plaintiff Casey is of Cherokee descent and was fifty-nine years old \nat the time of trial.  Throughout the twenty-six years that he has been incarcerated in G2 \ncustody, he has never received a major disciplinary infraction and never participated in \nbehavior that caused his custody status level to be increased.  More specifically, he has had \nno infractions for possession of drugs or weapons, fighting, or attempted escape, and has not \nbeen the target of violence.  Before transferring to TDCJ, Casey spent two and a half years \nincarcerated in a Texas jail where male inmates are allowed to have long hair.  Casey wore \nhis hair long during that period of his incarceration, without any incidents of contraband, \nescape attempts, lice outbreaks, or violence from the long hair.  Casey has always observed, \nand continues to observe, appropriate personal hygiene habits and does not present any \nhealth risks related to wearing long hair.  \n18 / 23 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 322   Filed on 01/24/19 in TXSD   Page 19 of 23\nPlaintiff Cobb.  Plaintiff Cobb is of Cherokee, Powhatan, and Iroquois descent and \nwas 42 years old at the time of trial.  Incarcerated for over twenty years, he was initially \nplaced in G3 custody status, which was improved to G2 in March 2007.  Throughout his \nincarceration, Cobb has never participated in behavior that caused his custody status level to \nbe increased.   Over the last ten  years, Cobb has received  only  two minor disciplinary \ninfractions, no major infractions, has had no infractions for possession of drugs or weapons, \nfighting, or attempted escape, and has not been the target of violence.  Before transferring to \nTDCJ, Cobb spent a year and a half incarcerated in a Texas jail where male inmates are \nallowed to have long hair.  Cobb wore his hair long during this period, without any incidents \nof contraband, escape attempts, lice outbreaks, or violence associated with his long hair.  \nCobb has always observed, and continues to observe, appropriate personal hygiene habits \nand does not present any health risks related to wearing long hair. \nPlaintiff Goodman.  Plaintiff Goodman is of Cherokee descent and was 53 years old \nat the time of trial.  He has been incarcerated for over twenty-two years, with a custody level \nof G2.  Over the last ten years, Goodman has not participated in any behavior that caused \nhis custody status level to be increased, has no major disciplinary infractions, has had no \ninfractions for possession of drugs or weapons, fighting, or attempted escape, and has not \nbeen the target of violence.  He has had several minor infractions, none of which were \ndemonstrated to counsel against an exemption to wear long, loose hair.  Before transferring \nto TDCJ, Goodman spent six months incarcerated in a Texas jail where male inmates are \nallowed to have long hair.  During this period of his incarceration, he wore his hair long, \nwithout any incidents of contraband, escape attempts, lice outbreaks, or violence associated \n19 / 23 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 322   Filed on 01/24/19 in TXSD   Page 20 of 23\nwith  long  hair.    Goodman  has  always  observed,  and  continues  to  observe,  appropriate \npersonal hygiene habits and does not present any health risks related to wearing long hair. \nPlaintiffs, Generally.  Statistically speaking, these three Plaintiffs present a very low \nrisk of violence, smuggling contraband, and attempting escape—lower than the average \nfemale inmate.  Even if the evidence had supported a finding that long hair significantly \nincreased  these  risks,  TDCJ  offered  no  evidence  that  these  particular  Plaintiffs  would \nsuccumb to those risks.  Neither is there any evidence that allowing these three Plaintiffs to \nwear long hair will increase the incidence of head lice or impose significant budgetary costs \nrelated to searches.  Finally, the threat of an inmate’s ability to grow long hair being revoked \nis an effective tool for discouraging  abuse  of the privilege and for promoting  positive \nbehavior such as proper grooming.  \n8.  Conclusion \nTDCJ has the burden to show that the male grooming policy that prohibits an inmate \nfrom growing long hair serves a compelling governmental interest.  Holt, 135 S. Ct. at 863.  \nThe evidence does not support the proposition that the policy furthers any of the safety, \nsecurity, health, or budgetary interests it has alleged.  The Court FINDS that the policy does \nnot serve a compelling state interest. \nE. Least Restrictive Means \nUnder RLUIPA, the government’s burden is to show both (1) the policy furthers a \ncompelling  governmental  interest,  and  (2)  the  policy  is  the  least  restrictive  means  for \nfurthering that interest.  42 U.S.C. § 2000cc.  Because the test is conjunctive, TDCJ’s failure \nto show that the policy furthers a compelling governmental interest obviates the need to \n20 / 23 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 322   Filed on 01/24/19 in TXSD   Page 21 of 23\nconsider the least restrictive means test.2  However, because the record makes the issue \nabundantly clear, the Court sets out its resolution as an alternative basis for its ruling.   \n“The least-restrictive-means standard is exceptionally demanding, and it requires the \ngovernment to show that it lacks other means of achieving its desired goal other than the \nchallenged policy.”  Ware, 866 F.3d at 269 (citations and quotation marks omitted).  Courts \nhave recognized that revocation of a privilege is the least restrictive means of furthering \ninterests in a number of contexts.  See Holt, 135 S. Ct. at 867 (institution could withdraw \nbeard accommodation if abused); Ali, 822 F.3d at 795 (Texas prison could revoke beard and \nkufi privileges as least restrictive means).  A revoked privileged can no longer be abused.  \nTDCJ has not offered any evidence or argument to suggest that the ability to revoke the \nprivilege is insufficient to promote its interests.  Rather, the credible evidence shows that the \nthreat  of  revocation  can  deter  bad  behavior  because  inmates  value  the  privileges  they \nreceive. \nTDCJ’s policy is also not the least restrictive means because the vast majority of \nstates allow long hair, and TDCJ has offered no credible reason for Texas to have a different \npolicy.  \n“[W]hen  so  many  prisons  offer  an  accommodation,  a  prison \nmust, at minimum, offer persuasive reasons why it believes that \nit must take a different course.”  Accordingly, in the face of \nevidence  of  contrary  policies,  we  may  not  defer  to  prison \nofficials’  “mere  say-so  that  they  could  not  accommodate  the \nplaintiff's request” because these other policies indicate that a \nless restrictive means may be available. \n                                            \n2   See generally, Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418 (2006) (after addressing \nidentical language in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1, the Court concluded its opinion \nafter finding no compelling governmental interest). \n21 / 23 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 322   Filed on 01/24/19 in TXSD   Page 22 of 23\nWare, 866 F.3d at 269 (citing Holt) (quotations omitted).  \nEvidence at trial showed that the vast majority of states, the entire Federal Bureau of \nPrisons, and even jails within Texas allow inmates to wear long hair.  Texas is only one of \neight states that do not allow men to have long hair in their prison system.  TDCJ has \noffered no persuasive reason why Texas is unique in needing to deny long hair.  The Fifth \nCircuit has held that the exact same disparity in long hair policies rendered Louisiana’s hair \npolicy not the least restrictive means.  See Ware, 866 F.3d at 273. \nOther measures provide solutions to some of the problems TDCJ has alleged.  For \ninstance, with respect to any health or sanitation issue, a less restrictive policy would be to \nallow long hair, but require recipients of the exemption to regularly wash their hair, noting \nthat grooming issues are not a problem in female prisons.  With respect to the identification \nissue, TDCJ could easily provide pictures of an inmate with long and short hair on escape \nfliers.  See Holt, 135 S. Ct. 865 (“[T]he Department could largely solve this problem by \nrequiring that all inmates be photographed without beards when first admitted to the facility \nand, if necessary, periodically thereafter.”).  And as Administrator Palmateer suggested, \nTDCJ could take pictures of the inmates with their long hair pulled back to simulate short \nhair.   \nEven if it requires TDCJ to expend more resources to manage the male inmates that \ndesire to wear long hair as a religious practice, “Congress stated that RLUIPA ‘may require \na government to incur expenses in its own operations to avoid imposing a substantial burden \non religious exercise.’”  Holt, 135 S. Ct. at 860.  \n22 / 23 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 322   Filed on 01/24/19 in TXSD   Page 23 of 23\nCONCLUSION \n  For the reasons set out above, Plaintiffs are entitled to judgment against Defendant \nenjoining TDCJ from enforcing its male grooming policy against Plaintiffs with respect to \nthe rules preventing inmates from growing their hair long and wearing it loose.  Plaintiffs \nare further entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees and costs as prevailing parties.

The motion is not signed by co-\nplaintiff Goodman.   Plaintiff was warned at the evidentiary hearing that he is not a lawyer and he cannot file \nmotions on behalf of his co-plaintiff.  Co-plaintiff Goodman is perfectly capable of filing his own motions for relief.  \nTo the extent that plaintiff Davis is acting on behalf of anyone but himself, the request is struck as improper. \n1 / 4 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 41   Filed on 09/17/12 in TXSD   Page 2 of 4\n \nlawsuit as a co-plaintiff.  Service of process has been ordered.  Plaintiff brings this \nmotion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, complaining that he \nand co-plaintiff Goodman are not being allowed adequate time together in the law library \nto work on their lawsuit. \n III.  Discussion. \n  In order to obtain a preliminary injunction under Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(a), the \napplicant must demonstrate: (1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) a \nsubstantial threat that the movant will suffer irreparable injury if the injunction is denied; \n(3) the threatened injury outweighs any damage that the injunction might cause the \ndefendant; and (4) the injunction will not disserve the public interest.  Affiliated \nProfessional Home Health Care Agency v. Shalala, 164 F.3d 282, 285 (5th Cir. 1999).  \nInjunctive relief is an extraordinary remedy which requires the applicant to unequivocally \nshow the need for its issuance.  See Valley v. Rapides Parish School Bd., 118 F.3d 1047, \n1050 (5th Cir. 1997).  Plaintiff must carry the burden as to all four elements before a \npreliminary injunction may be considered.  United States v. Jefferson County, 720 F.2d \n1511, 1519 (5th Cir. 1983). \n  Plaintiff’s motion fails to warrant such an extraordinary remedy.  Even assuming \nplaintiff could demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of his claims, he has not \nsuffered any irreparable injury.  Plaintiff agrees that he has had law library time with his \nco-plaintiff, but he merely believes the time allotted has not been sufficient.  Plaintiff \nfails to explain what he could accomplish with more law library time.  Service of process \nhas been ordered in the case, and after answers are filed, the court will hear dispositive \n2 / 4 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 41   Filed on 09/17/12 in TXSD   Page 3 of 4\n \nmotions.  Plaintiff does not represent the co-plaintiff, and the co-plaintiff is capable of \nfiling his own motions and responses to dispositive motions.  Plaintiff has not \ndemonstrated any harm at all, and especially not harm outweighed by the defendants’ \ninterest in maintaining security at the prison unit. \n  Finally, plaintiff has not shown that ordering of injunctive relief at this time would  \nserve the public interest.  Federal courts are reluctant to interfere in the internal affairs of \nlocal jails or state prisons.  See Kahey v. Jones, 836 F.2d 948, 950 (5th Cir. 1988) \n(federal courts defer to prison administrators concerning day-to-day operations).  The \nordering of injunctive relief at this stage of plaintiff’s case would not serve the public \ninterest. \nIV.  RECOMMENDATION   \nBased on the foregoing, it is respectfully recommended that plaintiff’s motion for \na temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction (D.E. 29-1, 29-2) be denied. \n  ORDERED this 17th day of September, 2012. \n \n \n___________________________________ \nB.

Within FOURTEEN (14) DAYS after being served with a copy \nof the Memorandum and Recommendation, a party may file with the Clerk and serve on \nthe United States Magistrate Judge and all parties, written objections, pursuant to Fed.

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS \nCORPUS CHRISTI DIVISION \n \nTEDDY NORRIS DAVIS, et al,  §  \n  §  \n              Plaintiffs,  §  \nVS.  §     CIVIL ACTION NO. 2:12-CV-166 \n  §  \nBILLY PIERCE, et al,  §  \n  §  \n              Defendants.  §  \n \nOPINION AND ORDER ON CROSS-MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n \nIn this prisoner civil rights action, Plaintiffs Teddy Norris Davis and Robbie Dow \nGoodman allege that Defendants have violated, and continue to violate, their right to \npractice  their  Native  American  religion,  in  violation  of  the  Religious  Land  Use  and \nInstitutionalized Persons Act (RLUPIA), 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc, and the First Amendment. \nPlaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief from the Texas Department of Criminal \nJustice,  Criminal  Institutions  Division  (TDCJ-CID),  by  and  through  the  TDCJ-CID \nDirector William Stephens, sued in his official capacity only, to: (1) allow Plaintiffs to \nsmoke a communal pipe and/or a personal pipe during Native American ceremonies; (2) \nprovide a minimum of two pipe ceremonies per month and/or otherwise increase the \nnumber of Native American services at the McConnell Unit; (3) allow Plaintiffs to grow \ntheir hair and/or grow a kouplock; and (4) allow Plaintiffs to wear their medicine bags at \nall times.  (D.E. 1, 16, 88).  Plaintiffs have also sued Clint Morris, the TDCJ Program \nAnalyst for Designated Units, claiming that he personally violated their First Amendment \nfree exercise rights because he failed to advocate for the rights of Native American \n1 / 39 \n\nprisoners,  including  Plaintiffs,  and  as  such,  is  liable  in  his  individual  capacity  for \nmonetary damages.  (See Case No. 2:12-cv-166, Minutes Entry for 02/22/13, and D.E. \n143 at pp. 1-2, Plaintiffs’ SJM response). \nPending is Defendants’ motion for summary judgment to deny Plaintiffs’ claims \n(D.E. 120-122, 125), and Plaintiffs’ cross-motion for summary judgment.   (D.E. 129).  \nFor the reasons stated herein, Defendants’ motion is granted, and Plaintiffs’ claims are \ndismissed with prejudice. \nI.    Jurisdiction. \n  The Court has federal question jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1331.  Upon consent of the parties (D.E. 87, 102, 157), this case was referred to the \nundersigned United States magistrate judge to conduct all further proceedings, including \nentry of final judgment.  (D.E. 107).  See 28 U.S.C. § 636(c). \nII.   Procedural background. \nThe  procedural  history  of  this  case  has  been  fully  and  accurately  detailed  in \nprevious pleadings, and is adequately reflected in the docket.  However, a brief review is \npresented to explain the current posture of Plaintiffs’ claims against the remaining two \nDefendants. \nPlaintiffs are prisoners in the TDCJ-CID, and are both currently confined at the \nMcConnell Unit in Beeville, Texas.  Both Plaintiffs practice the Native American (NA) \nfaith.1  On  May  21,  2012,  Plaintiff  Davis  filed  his  original  complaint  challenging  as \n                                              \n1 The Court acknowledges that neither the term “Native American faith” nor “Native American \nreligion” adequately represents the defined belief system of the Plaintiffs or any particular Native \n2 / 39 \n\nunconstitutional, inter alia, the TDCJ grooming policy requiring inmates to cut their hair, \nthe prohibition of wearing a medicine bag, and the lack of NA services.  (D.E. 1).  He \nnamed  as  defendants  the  TDCJ-CID  Director  (then  Rick  Thaler,  and  now  William \nStephens) and Bill Pierce, the Director of the TDCJ Chaplaincy Department. \nOn June 21, 2012, a Spears2 hearing was held with Plaintiff Davis, and he orally \nmoved to add as defendants (1) Clint Morris, the Program Analyst for Designated Units, \n(2) Madeline Ortiz, the Director of Rehabilitative Programs, and (3) Shawna Mitchell, the \nMcConnell Unit Chaplain. \nOn June 22, 2012, Robbie Goodman was granted leave to join as a plaintiff.  (D.E. \n16). \nOn  July  12,  2012,  Plaintiffs  filed  a  motion  to  add  as  a  defendant  Regional \nChaplain Sam Longoria.  (D.E. 21). \nOn  July  13,  2012,  service  was  ordered  on  Defendants  Thaler,  Pierce,  Morris, \nOrtiz, and Mitchell.  (D.E. 22). \n On August 27, 2012, Defendants Thaler, Pierce, Morris, Ortiz, and Mitchell filed \ntheir Answer.  (D.E. 30). On August 30, 2012, Shawna Mitchell filed a Rule 12(b)(6) \n                                                                                                                                                  \nAmerican practitioner because the faith itself encompass a wide range of beliefs from different \ntribes and regions.  See Affidavit of Chari Bouse, Contract Native American Chaplain, MSJ App. \n122 (“Currently, there are 565 federally recognized tribes… Each tribe has its own specific \ncustoms and traditions.  However, there are several ‘inter-tribal’ customs, and even that varies in \ntribes from different states.  NAs are not religious by nature, but adhere to what we call a ‘way of \nlife.’  Our people are ‘monotheistic,’ meaning we recognize only one Creator God or deity…”). \nA running similarity in the Native American faith system is the central relationship of human \nbeings, and their bodies, to the land, nature, reality, and spirituality.  See Lyng v. Northwest \nIndian Cemetery Protective Ass’n, 485 U.S. 439, 460-61 (1988) (J. Brennan, dissenting).   \n  \n2 Spears v. McCotter, 766 F.2d 179 (5th Cir. 1985). \n \n3 / 39 \n\nmotion to dismiss (D.E. 32), to which Plaintiffs agreed (D.E. 44), and Chaplain Mitchell \nwas dismissed from this action.  (D.E. 64). \nOn October 10, 2012, Defendant Morris filed a motion to dismiss arguing, inter \nalia, that Plaintiffs were attempting to hold him liable on a theory of respondeat superior. \n(D.E. 51).  On January 7, 2013, Plaintiffs’ RLUIPA and § 1983 claims against Morris in \nhis official capacity were dismissed; but the Court retained Plaintiff’s free exercise claims \nagainst Morris in his individual capacity.  (See D.E. 65, 80). \nOn  September  17,  2012,  Plaintiffs  were  granted  leave  to  add  as  a  defendant \nChaplain Longoria, (D.E. 39), and on November 1, 2012, Longoria filed a motion to \ndismiss.  (D.E. 56). \nOn November 23, 2012, Plaintiffs sought leave to file an amended complaint.  \n(D.E. 71).  Leave was granted, and on February 11, 2013, Plaintiffs filed their Amended \nComplaint.3  (D.E. 88). \nOn February 22, 2013, a telephone conference was held during which Plaintiffs \norally  moved  to  dismiss  all  claims  against  Defendants  Ortiz,  Longoria,  and  Pierce.  \nPlaintiffs retained their RLUIPA claim and First Amendment claim against the TDCJ \nDirector, and retained their free exercise claim against Defendant Morris in his individual \ncapacity only.   \nOn July 8, 2013, Defendants filed the instant motion for summary judgment (D.E. \n120), with an accompanying appendix, (D.E. 121-122), and supplement.4  (D.E. 125). \n                                              \n3 The operative pleading is now Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint (D.E. 88), filed on February 11, \n2013. \n \n4 / 39 \n\nOn July 19, 2013, Plaintiffs filed a motion for “summary judgment default” (D.E. \n129), to which Defendants filed a response (D.E. 131).  Also on that date, William \nStephens was substituted as the proper party defendant in place of Rick Thaler. \nFollowing  several  extensions  of  time,  on  October  28,  2013,  Plaintiffs  filed  a \nresponse in opposition to Defendants’ summary judgment motion. (D.E. 143). Thereafter, \nadditional time was granted for both parties to file additional supplements, responses, and \nreplies.  \nIII.  Summary judgment evidence. \nOn April 13, 1995, Jolene Yellowquill, a Native American of Ojibwe heritage who \nwas confined at a TDCJ unit in Gatesville, Texas, filed suit for injunctive relief in the \nUnited  States  District  Court  for  the  Southern  District  of  Texas,  Houston  Division, \nseeking, inter alia, that the TDCJ be required to provide sacred pipe ceremonies to Native \nAmerican adherents confined within the TDCJ.  (See Yellowquill v. Scott, Case No. 4:95-\ncv-1080, D.E. 1, 63).  On May 22, 1997, the Houston district court granted Yellowtail’s \nmotion  for  a  temporary  restraining  order.    (Id.,  Case  No.  4:95-cv-1080  at  D.E.  71).  \nThereafter, the parties reached a settlement.  Id., D.E. 119. Although Yellowquill involved \nonly one inmate, the resulting settlement agreement served as the basis for the TDCJ \nimplementing certain policies to address the practice of the NA faith. \n                                                                                                                                                  \n4 On December 20, 2013, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ request for a complimentary copy of the \nAppendix (filed at D.E. 121 and 122), to Defendants’ summary judgment motion.  (See D.E. \n150).  Because all parties have access to the Appendix, for consistency and ease, reference in this \nOrder to the summary judgment evidence will be to “Appx” followed by a specific page citation, \nif appropriate.   \n \n5 / 39 \n\nOn January 7, 1998, Plaintiff Davis identified his religious preference as Baptist \nwhen  entering  the  TDCJ  system.    (See  Appx  100-101,  relevant  portions  of  Davis’ \nChaplaincy  file).    On  September  13,  1999,  Plaintiff  Davis  changed  his  religious \npreference  to  Native  American  spirituality.    (Appx  101).    On  May  5,  2011,  Davis \nchanged his preference to Native American Shamanism.  (Appx 101). \n  On  November  27,  1996,  Plaintiff  Goodman  listed  his  religious  affiliation  as \nBaptist  when  he  entered  the  TDCJ.    (Appx  103,  Goodman’s  Chaplaincy  file).    On \nNovember 20, 1999, Goodman changed his religious preference to Native American.  \n(Appx 103). \n  In November 2004, the TDCJ Offender Orientation Handbook was revised.   (See \nAppx 227-244).  The Handbook includes a grooming policy mandating that offenders \nmaintain “good personal hygiene,” brush their teeth daily, and be clean-shaven.  (Appx at \n235).  As to hair length, the grooming policy states: \nMale offenders must keep their hair trimmed up the back of their neck \nand head.  Hair must be neatly cut.  Hair must be cut around the ears.  \nSideburns will not extend below the middle of the ears.  No block \nstyle,  afro,  natural  or  shag  haircuts  will  be  permitted.    No  fad or \nextreme  hairstyles  /haircuts  are  allowed.    No  mohawks,  tails,  or \ndesigns cut into the hair are allowed. \n \n(Appx at 235).   The November 2004 Offender Handbook also includes the TDCJ’s \nTobacco Policy, stating that “[a]ll facilities within the TDCJ are designated as tobacco \n6 / 39 \n\nfree,” and advising offenders found in possession of “tobacco products, paraphernalia or \nsimilar products may be charged with a disciplinary offense.”5  (Appx at 238).     \nOn May 8, 2006, the TDCJ instituted Administrative Directive AD-07.30 (rev. 6) \nregarding  Procedures  for  Religious  Programming.    (Appx  370-381).    AD-07.30  is  a \ngeneral statement encompassing all faith groups: \nThe Texas Department of Criminal Justice extends to offenders of all \nfaiths who are supervised or incarcerated within TDCJ operated units \nor  contracted  facilities,  reasonable  and  equitable  opportunities  to \npursue  religious  beliefs  and  participate  in  religious  activities  and \nprograms that do not endanger the safe, secure, and orderly operation \nof the Agency. \n \n(Appx at 370).  AD-07.30 defines such terms as “approved volunteer,” “Holy Day” and \n“religious ceremony,” and sets out general guidelines for offenders seeking to participate \nin religious activities.  (Appx 371-381).   AD-07.30 does not address any single faith \ngroup in particular.  Id. \nIn November 2008, the TDCJ Chaplaincy Department revised Policy 09.03 (rev. \n4) to create an exception to the TDCJ tobacco ban for NA believers at pipe ceremonies.  \n(See Appx 367-369). The policy provided: \n(3)  TDCJ policy forbids the use or possession of tobacco in prison by \noffenders.  However, an exception to policy is in effect for Native \nAmerican  religious  practitioners  participating  in  the  circle  group \nprayer pipe ceremony of Native American-designated units/facilities.   \n \n                               .  .  .   \n \n                                              \n5 Effective March 1, 1995, the TDCJ banned the use of all tobacco products within its \ninstitutions, for both offenders and employees.  (See Appx 127-129). \n \n7 / 39 \n\n(5)  The pipe ceremony will be conducted at a rate of no more than \ntwice  each  month  on  Native  American-designated  units/facilities.  \nThis is contingent upon availability of a qualified Native American \nchaplain, or a TDCJ approved volunteer, the pipe ceremony will be \nsupervised and/or facilitated by one of these. \n \n(6)  The  pipe  ceremony  will  include  tobacco  or  sage,  sweet  grass, \nkinnikkinnick,  or  cedar.    These  may  be  used  in  combination  as \nprescribed by Native American tradition. \n \n(Appx 367-369) (emphasis in original). \n  In June 2009, the TDCJ Chaplaincy Department revised Policy 09.01 (rev. 4) in \nregards to general information about the religious beliefs of practitioners of the Native \nAmerican faith.  (See Appx 414-418).  The policy addresses group worship and pipe \nceremonies, smudging, and “medicine bundles.”  Id. at 417-18. \nAlso in June 2009, the TDCJ Chaplaincy Department revised Policy 09.02 (rev. 5) \nregarding  medicine  bags.    (See  Appx  419-422).    Policy  09.02  provides  specific \ninformation about the size of the permitted medicine bags and identifies the objects it \nmay contain.  Id. at 421.  In addition, it advises offenders that: “[i]n prison, wearing the \nmedicine bag is limited to the offender’s cell or immediate bunk area in a dorm setting \nand at religious services.”  Id. TDCJ Chaplaincy Department Policy 05.02, also addresses \napproved devotional items for offenders to possess, including those relevant to the NA \nfaith.  (See Appx 410-413). \nOn March 9, 2010, TDCJ revised its Administrative Directive AD-03.83 (rev. 6), \nto provide that offenders who do not comply with the grooming standards are subject to \ndisciplinary action.  (See Appx 245-247). \n8 / 39 \n\n  On June 16, 2011, William Chance, a Native American prisoner confined at the \nMichael Unit in Tennessee Colony, Texas, sued the TDCJ and certain officials in the \nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division, alleging \nthat  he  had  been  denied,  inter  alia,  the  right  to  participate  in  pipe  ceremonies  and \nsmudging rituals in violation of RLUIPA and his First Amendment rights.  (See Chance \nv. TDCJ, Case No. 6:11-cv-435, D.E. 1).  Plaintiff Chance related that he suffers from \ntwo  serious  infectious  diseases,  Hepatitis  C  and  Tuberculosis,  and  because  of  his \ncommunicable diseases, he could not smoke from the communal pipe used during pipe \nceremonies, and he sought permission to possess a personal pipe.  Id. \nIn response to the Chance litigation, on September 8, 2011, a meeting was held \nwith former TDCJ-CID Director Rick Thaler, Chaplaincy Director Bill Pierce, Program \nAnalyst Clint Morris, and other officials to discuss the status of NA contract chaplains, \nthe possibility of hiring full-time chaplains, and NA communal pipe services, including \nmedical and sanitation issues, liability releases, protective covers for pipes, frequency of \npipe services, costs of pipes, and the increase in NA adherents over time.  (Appx 111-\n114).  At the meeting, it was decided that only the Native American Chaplain could \nsmoke the ceremonial pipe at a pipe ceremony.  (Appx 423, Affidavit of Billy Pierce, \nDirector  Chaplaincy  Operations).    All  Native  American  chaplains  conducting  pipe \nceremonies were advised by telephone after the meeting, and the policy went into effect \nas of that date.   Id. \nOn May 21, 2012, the instant lawsuit was filed.  (D.E. 1). \n9 / 39 \n\nIn July 2012, the TDCJ Chaplaincy Department revised Policy 09.01 (rev. 5).  \n(See Appx 198-200).  Revised Policy 09.01 provides that “only the Native American \nchaplain/volunteer is authorized to smoke the pipe used for the pipe service).  Id. at 199. \nIV.    Summary judgment standard. \n \n  Summary judgment is proper if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact \nand the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  A \ngenuine issue exists “if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict \nfor the nonmoving party.”  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).  \nThe Court must examine “whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to \nrequire submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a \nmatter of law.”  Id. at 251-52.  In making this determination, the Court must consider the \nrecord as a whole by reviewing all pleadings, depositions, affidavits and admissions on \nfile, and drawing all justifiable inferences in favor of the party opposing the motion.  \nCaboni v. Gen. Motors Corp., 278 F.3d 448, 451 (5th Cir. 2002).  The Court may not \nweigh the evidence, or evaluate the credibility of witnesses.  Id.  Furthermore, “affidavits \nshall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in \nevidence, and shall show affirmatively  that  the affiant is competent to testify to the \nmatters stated therein.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e); see also Cormier v. Pennzoil Exploration \n& Prod. Co., 969 F.2d 1559, 1561 (5th Cir. 1992) (per curiam) (refusing to consider \naffidavits that relied on hearsay statements); Martin v. John W. Stone Oil Distrib., Inc.,  \n \n10 / 39 \n\n819  F.2d  547,  549  (5th  Cir.  1987)  (per  curiam)  (stating  that  courts  cannot  consider \nhearsay  evidence  in  affidavits  and  depositions).    Unauthenticated  and  unverified \ndocuments do not constitute proper summary judgment evidence.  King v. Dogan, 31 \nF.3d 344, 346 (5th Cir. 1994) (per curiam). \n  The moving party bears the initial burden of showing the absence of a genuine \nissue of material fact.  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).  If the moving \nparty demonstrates an absence of evidence supporting the nonmoving party’s case, then \nthe burden shifts to the nonmoving party to come forward with specific facts showing \nthat a genuine issue for trial does exist.  Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio \nCorp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986).  To sustain this burden, the nonmoving party cannot \nrest on the mere allegations of the pleadings.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e); Anderson, 477 U.S. \nat 248.  “After the nonmovant has been given an opportunity to raise a genuine factual \nissue, if no reasonable juror could find for the nonmovant, summary judgment will be \ngranted.”  Caboni, 278 F.3d at 451.  “If reasonable minds could differ as to the import of \nthe evidence ... a verdict should not be directed.”  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 250-51. \n  The  evidence  must  be  evaluated  under  the  summary  judgment  standard  to \ndetermine whether the moving party has shown the absence of a genuine issue of material \nfact.  “[T]he substantive law will identify which facts are material.  Only disputes over \nfacts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly \npreclude the entry of summary judgment.”  Id. at 248.   \n \n \n11 / 39 \n\nV.  Discussion and Analysis. \n  A.  Threshold determinations. \n(1)  The Chance case and summary judgment. \nAs a threshold matter, the Court notes that a common thread throughout Plaintiffs’ \nRLUIPA claims is premised on the fact the TDCJ previously allowed practices that it \nnow seeks to prohibit.  Plaintiffs argue that, because the TDCJ followed more liberal \npolicies in the past, and also because other prisons allow certain practices that the TDCJ \ndoes not, there necessarily exists a genuine issue of material fact on the issue of least \nrestrictive means such that summary is inappropriate as a matter of law.   \nThe Fifth Circuit has squarely rejected the idea that a fact issue is created as to the \nissue of least restrictive means simply because the TDCJ had a past policy allowing a \nnow-prohibited activity or that other correctional systems allow an activity that the TDCJ \nprohibits. See United States v. Chance, 730 F.3d 404 (5th Cir. 2013).  In Chance, the \nNative American plaintiff was seeking inter alia, access to a sweat lodge, and he offered \nevidence that a federal correctional facility nearby provided such access.  Id. at 411.  The \nFifth  Circuit  found  irrelevant  the  practices  of  other  prison  systems,  noting  that  a \ncomparison of policies ignores “the differences between institutions and all the other \nfactors that might be more relevant in a given case.”   Id. (citing Fowler v. Crawford,   \n534 F.3d 931, 934 (8th Cir. 2008)).  The Fifth Circuit concluded that the mere existence \nof a prison policy that differs from a past policy or another institution’s policy does not \nnecessarily entitle a plaintiff to survive summary judgment on his RLUIPA claim.  Id.  \nIndeed, as the Chance Court aptly noted: “That TDCJ or other prisons have tolerated \n12 / 39 \n\nunsafe  practices  in  that  past  is  not  a  reason  to  permanently  bind  it  to  a  dangerous \npolicy.”6  Id. at 412. Rather, as will be discussed in more detail below, the RLUIPA \nanalysis mandates a case-specific approach when analyzing the issue of least restrictive \nmeans on summary judgment, and accordingly, the Court overrules Plaintiffs’ argument \nthat a fact issue exists simply because the TDCJ previously had more liberal policies or \nthat other penal  institutions provide  more services and accommodations to offenders \npracticing the NA faith. \n(2)  Exhaustion. \nAs  another  preliminary  matter,  the  Court  acknowledges  that  Defendants  have \nmoved  for  summary  judgment  to  dismiss  certain  of  Plaintiffs’  claims  for  failure  to \nexhaust administrative remedies. \nIn 1996, Congress enacted the Prison Litigation Reform Act, which mandated that \nno  action  shall  be  brought  by  a  prisoner  “until  such  administrative  remedies  as  are \navailable  are  exhausted.”    42  U.S.C.  §  1997e(a).    The  Supreme  Court  unanimously \nconcluded that inmates must exhaust their administrative remedies before proceeding in \nfederal court.  Booth v. Churner, 532 U.S. 731 (2001).  It has also repeatedly held that \nexhaustion is mandatory and is required for all actions brought by prisoners.  Woodford v. \nNgo, 548 U.S. 81, 84 (2006); Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 524 (2002).  In Jones v. \n                                              \n6 Other circuit courts have rejected the adoption of a per se rule or bright-line test in evaluating \nRLUIPA’s least restrictive means issue.  See, e.g., Mays v. Springborn, 575 F.3d 643, 647 (7th \nCir. 2009) (affirming summary judgment dismissing prisoner’s free exercise claim where “the \nonly evidence he produced was that the [forbidden items] were allowed at other prisons”); Spratt \nv. R.I. Dep’t of Corr., 482 F.3d 33, 42 (1st Cir. 2007) (“[E]vidence of policies at one prison is \nnot conclusive proof that the same policies would work at another institution.” ). \n13 / 39 \n\nBock, 549 U.S. 199, 217 (2007), the Supreme Court rejected a “name all defendants” \nrequirement that was judicially created by the Sixth Circuit. \nPlaintiff Davis’ relevant grievance records are filed at Appx 001-037.  Plaintiff \nGoodman’s relevant grievance records are filed at Appx 039-066.  In turn, Defendants \nhave offered the Affidavit of Sandra K. Murphy, TDCJ Manager of Offender Grievances, \nwho testifies that, based upon her review of the grievance records for both Plaintiffs, \nneither Davis nor Goodman submitted a grievance regarding his medicine bag.  (See \nAppx  038  (Davis),  Appx  067  (Goodman)).    In  their  summary  judgment  response, \nPlaintiff Davis states that his medicine bag grievances were lost when TDCJ officials \npacked his possessions and moved him to 3-Building in retaliation for filing a grievance \nabout the pipe ceremonies.   (D.E. 143, p. 12).  Offender Goodman claims that he filed a \ngrievance about the medicine bag as a precursor to filing suit in state court.  (D.E. 143, p. \n14). \nThe Court concludes that it need not resolve the exhaustion dispute because it will \nbe  more  beneficial  to  address  Plaintiffs’  RLUIPA  claims  on  the  merits.    Thus, \nDefendants’ motion for summary judgment for failure to exhaust is denied as moot. \n(3)  Sincerity of Plaintiffs’ beliefs. \nThe last issue properly addressed at the onset of this case is the sincerity of the \nPlaintiffs’ Native American beliefs.  See Moussazadeh v. TDCJ, 703 F.3d 781, 790-92 \n(5th Cir. 2012).  Briefly, each case turns on its particular facts.  Id. at 791.  The specific \nreligious practice must be examined rather than the general scope of applicable religious \ntenets,  and  the  plaintiff’s  “sincerity  in  espousing  that  practice  is  largely  a  matter  of \n14 / 39 \n\nindividual credibility.  Id. at 792.  In fact, the sincerity of a plaintiff’s engagement in a \nparticular religious practice is rarely challenged.  Id. at 791.  As Moussazadeh explains, \n“[t]hough the sincerity inquiry is important, it must be handled with a light touch, or \n‘judicial shyness.’”  Id. at 792 (quoting A.A. ex rel Betenbaugh v. Needville ISD, 611 F.3d \n248, 262 (5th Cir. 2010). \nIn this case, Defendants do not seriously challenge the Plaintiffs’ beliefs, but do \npoint out that Plaintiffs were both self-identified as Baptists when they entered the TDCJ.  \nThis fact fails to cast doubt on the credibility of either Plaintiff, and the Court finds that \nboth Davis and Goodman are sincere in the practice of their NA faith. \nB.  The RLUIPA Standard. \n  Congress enacted the RLUIPA as a response to the Supreme Court’s decisions in \nEmployment Division, Department of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U.S. \n872 (1990) and City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507 (1997).  In Smith, the Supreme \nCourt held that the Free Exercise Clause typically does not shield religiously motivated \nconduct from the burdens of generally applicable laws.  494  U.S. at 878-79.  Congress \nresponded three years later by enacting the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA).  \nIn an effort to restore the level of protection that religious observations enjoyed before \nSmith, the RFRA mandated that “government”—including state and local governments—\n“shall not substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion even if the burden results \nfrom  a  rule  of  general  applicability”  unless  such  a  burden  met  a  “compelling \ngovernmental interest” and “least restrictive means” test.  42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1.  In \n15 / 39 \n\nFlores, the Court declared the RFRA’s application to the States unconstitutional because \nit exceeded Congress’s Fourteenth Amendment enforcement power.  521 U.S. at 532-36. \nIn response to the Flores decision, Congress enacted RLUIPA, predicating its \nenactment not only on its power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment, but also on its \nSpending and Commerce powers.   RLUIPA targets two areas: land-use regulation and \ninstitutions that receive federal funds.  With respect to its protection of institutionalized \npersons, the RLUIPA provides: \nNo government shall  impose a  substantial  burden on the religious \nexercise of a person residing in or confined to an institution … even if \nthe  burden  results  from  a  rule  of  general  applicability,  unless  the \ngovernment  demonstrates  that  imposition  of  the  burden  on  that \nperson— \n \n(A)  is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and  \n \n(B)  is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling \ngovernmental interest. \n \n42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1(a).  The Act broadly defines “religious exercise” to include “any \nexercise of religion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious \nbelief.”  Id. § 2000cc-5(7)(A).  Under the RLUIPA, the plaintiff bears the burden to \nprove that the challenged law, regulation or practice substantially burdens his exercise of \nreligion.  Once a plaintiff has made this prima facie showing, the defendant bears the \nburden to prove that the challenged regulation is the least restrictive means of furthering a \ncompelling governmental interest.  Id., § 2000cc-2(b).  And see Sossamon v. Texas, 131 \nS. Ct. 1651 (2011). \n16 / 39 \n\n  Despite  RLUIPA’s  express  purpose  to  protect  the  religious  observances  of \nindividualized persons, the statute does not give courts carte blanche to second-guess the \nreasoned judgments of prison officials.  Indeed, while Congress enacted the RLUIPA to \naddress the many “frivolous or arbitrary” barriers impeding institutionalized persons’ \nreligious exercise, it nevertheless anticipated that courts entertaining RLUIPA challenges \n“would  accord  ‘due  deference  to  the  experience  and  expertise  of  prison  and  jail \nadministrators.’”  Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S.709, 716-17 (2005) (quoting 146 Cong. \nRec.  16698,  16699  (2000)  (joint  statement  of  Sens.  Hatch  and  Kennedy  on  the \nRLUIPA)).  The Supreme Court has cautioned that “[w]e do not read RLUIPA to elevate \naccommodation of religious observances over an institution’s need to maintain order and \nsafety,” and “an accommodation must be measured so that it does not override other \nsignificant interests.”  Id. at 722.  The Court further instructed: \nWe have no cause to believe that RLUIPA would not be applied in an \nappropriately  balanced  way,  with  particular  sensitivity  to  security \nconcerns.  While the Act adopts a “compelling governmental interest” \nstandard,  context  matters  in  the  application  of  that  standard.  \nLawmakers  supporting  RLUIPA  were  mindful  of  the  urgency  of \ndiscipline,  order,  safety,  and  security  in  penal  institutions.    They \nanticipated  that  courts  would  apply  the  Act’s  standard  with  due \ndeference  to  the  experience  and  expertise  of  prison  and  jail \nadministrators in establishing necessary regulations and procedures to \nmaintain  good  order,  security  and  discipline,  consistent  with \nconsideration of costs and limited resources. \n \nId. at 722-23 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  This deference is not, \nhowever, unlimited, and “policies grounded on mere speculation, exaggerated fears, or \npost-hoc  rationalizations  will  not  suffice  to  meet  the  Act’s  requirements.”  Rich  v. \n17 / 39 \n\nSecretary, Florida Dep’t of Corrections, 716 F.3d 525, 533 (11th Cir. 2013) (internal \nquotation marks omitted). \nC.  Application of RLUIPA Standard to this Case.  \n(1)  The  policies  complained  of  present  a  substantial  burden  on \nPlaintiffs’ ability to practice their faith.  \n \n  Under  RLUIPA,  the  Plaintiffs  must  initially  demonstrate  that  a  government \npractice imposes a “substantial burden” on their religious exercise, which requires the \nCourt to determine: (1) whether the burdened activity is “religious exercise,” and if so, \n(2) is the burden “substantial”?  Adkins v. Kaspar, 393 F.3d 559, 567 (5th Cir. 2004).  \nRLUIPA defines “religious exercise” to include “any exercise of religion,” whether or \nnot compelled by, or central to, a system of religious beliefs.”  Id.  A government action \nor regulation creates a substantial burden on a religious exercise if it truly pressures the \nadherent  to  significantly  modify  his  religious  behavior  and  significantly  violates  his \nreligious beliefs.  Id.  at 570.   \nPlaintiffs  Davis  and  Goodman  argue  that  certain  TDCJ  policies  impose  a \nsubstantial burden on their ability to practice their NA faith.  In particular, Plaintiffs \ncomplain about the TDCJ’s: (1) ban on communal and individual pipes; (2) lack of twice-\nmonthly NA services; (3) the TDCJ grooming policy that prohibits long hair and/or a \nkouplock; and (4) the TDCJ’s ban on medicine bags being worn outside of an offender’s \ncell or living area. \n \n18 / 39 \n\nPlaintiffs complain that they are denied the right to personally smoke from the \nsacred pipe during pipe ceremonies.  Plaintiffs maintain that the pipe ceremonies enable \nthe participants to establish a personal relationship with the Creator through a direct \ndialogue, which can only be accomplished by personally inhaling and exhaling the smoke \nfrom the pipe.  (D.E. 147 at 17).  For the Spirits to answer a NA participant’s prayers, “he \nmust make a personal offering to them by personally smoking the pipe.” Id.  Plaintiffs \nargue that their desire to practice the sacred pipe ceremony in this manner is consistent \nwith the NA faith and is the method practiced by many other Native Americans, both \nincarcerated and outside of the prison setting.  Id. \n Plaintiffs’ NA faith is practiced and reinforced in ceremonies and gatherings with \nother  NA  believers.    Plaintiffs  claim  that  Defendants  have  denied  them  the  right  to \ncongregate with other Native Americans on a regular basis because they have failed to \nprovide volunteer chaplains to conduct and/or oversee ceremonies. \nAnother tenet of Plaintiffs’ NA faith is to grow their hair and to cut it only in cases \nof mourning.  (See Transcript of June 21, 2012 evidentiary hearing, D.E. 26 at 39).7 \nHowever, the TDCJ grooming policy requires that male offenders must keep their hair \ntrimmed up the back of their neck and head, and also trimmed around the ears.  (Appx \n227-244, at 235).   If an offender refuses to comply with the grooming standards, he is \nsubject to disciplinary charges that can result in the loss of privileges, and possibly, \n                                              \n7 Plaintiff Davis testified: “TDCJ has this policy stating that no inmates are supposed to be able \nto inflict harm on another inmate.  For the past 16 years, they’ve been allowing an inmate to \nforcefully cut my – a living part of my body – mutilate it …”  (D.E. 26, p. 39). \n \n19 / 39 \n\nadversely  affect  time-earning  classification  and  good  time  credits.    (Appx  245-247).  \nPlaintiffs suggest that, as a proposed compromise to long hair, they be permitted to wear \na kouplock, that is, a 2” x 2” square patch of hair at the base of the skull which may grow \ncontinuously.  (D.E. 143 at 13; D.E. 143-1 at 12-17). \nFinally,  Plaintiffs  maintain  that  Defendants  have  substantially  burdened  their \nreligious exercise by not allowing them to wear medicine bags at all times, including \nwhen they walk to chow,  are at recreation, or socializing in common areas.  Plaintiffs \nbelieve that the medicine bag and its contents help protect them from evil spirits. \nIn  Atkins  v.  Kaspar,  the  Fifth  Circuit  noted  that  it  held  under  RFRA  that \ncircumscribing the use of a medicine bag did not rise to the level of a substantial burden \non a prisoner’s NA practice, but grooming regulations did.8   Atkins, 393 F.3d at 568, n. \n35 (citing Diaz v. Collins, 114 F.3d 69 (5th Cir. 1997)).  However, given the Supreme \nCourt’s mandate to examine RLUIPA claims on a fact-specific case-by-case basis, the \nCourt concludes that Plaintiffs’ have met their summary judgment burden to establish \nthat the complained-of TDCJ policies and practices place a substantial burden on their  \nreligious exercise of their NA faith. \n                                              \n8 In Odneal v. Pierce, 324 Fed. Appx. 297, *2-3 (5th Cir. Apr. 3, 2009), the Fifth Circuit \nreversed  this  Court’s  §  1915A  dismissal  of  the  plaintiff’s  RLUIPA  claims  concerning  his \nmedicine bag and kouplock because this Court mistakenly applied the “legitimate penological \ninterests” test of Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78 (1987) and not the RLUIPA’s heightened standard \nof review.  The fact that the Odneal decision was reversed and remanded on the kouplock and \nmedicine bag claims, however, does not mean the Fifth Circuit found TDCJ’s policies regarding \nthe kouplock or medicine bags to be a substantial burden on Odneal’s religious exercise.  To the \ncontrary, because it was a § 1915A dismissal, there was no factual record created.  Thus the \nOdneal case has little or no bearing on the case sub judice.   \n20 / 39 \n\n(2)  Least restrictive means. \nHaving established substantial burden under RLUIPA, the burden now shifts to \nDefendants to demonstrate that the challenged policies are the least restrictive means of \nfurthering  a  compelling  governmental  interest.    42  U.S.C.  §  2000cc-1(a);  Chance  v. \nTDCJ, 730 F.3d 404, 410 (5th Cir. 2013). \n(a)  Smoking and/or possessing a pipe. \nUnder current TDCJ policy, the contract NA chaplain or authorized NA volunteer \nis the only individual permitted to smoke the pipe.  (See Appx 201-203, October 12, 2012 \nInter-Office  Memorandum  Re:  “Policy  regarding  Native  American  pipe  service”).  \nOffenders are permitted to handle the pipe prior to its lighting.  Id. at 202. \nPrior to this change in policy, Plaintiffs and other NA offenders were allowed to \nsmoke a communal sacred pipe.  However, several NA offenders filed administrative \ngrievances  with  the  TDCJ  complaining  about  the  risk  of  communicable  disease \ntransmission from a communal pipe, prompting TDCJ officials to seek a medical opinion \nfrom Dr. Robert Williams, Deputy Director of TDCJ’s Health Service Division.  (See \nChance,  730  F.3d  at  413  (noting  that,  prior  to  Chance  filing  his  lawsuit,  other  NA \ninmates had raised health concerns about the communal pipe)).   In his  opinion, Dr. \nWilliams concludes: \nThere is no way to share an object designed to be placed in one’s \nmouth outside of a clinical setting with enough certainty that diseases \ncannot be transmitted for Health Services to advocate instituting this \npractice.    If  it  is  determined  that  [TDCJ’s]  obligation  to  allow \nobservance of this practice outweighs [TDCJ’s] obligation to prevent \nspread of infection in our institutionalized setting, [TDCJ] will have to \ntake as effective measures as are feasible, but it should be understood \n21 / 39 \n\nthat  the  repercussions  of  this  practice  may  extend  beyond  the \nparticipants since they would subsequently expose others with whom \nthey  have  close  contact  to  any  disease  they  contracted  from \nparticipating in the practice.  \n \n(See Appx 115-120 at 116, Affidavit of Dr. Williams, dated June 10, 2013, citing to his \nprevious opinion that is also cited in Chance).  Based on Dr. Williams’ recommendation, \nthe  TDCJ  determined  that  it  would  no  longer  permit  a  communal  pipe  ceremony.  \nAlthough a form of the sacred pipe ceremony would still be held, only the chaplain \nconducting the service would be allowed to smoke the pipe and pray on behalf of those \npresent.  (See Appx 201-203, October 12, 2012 Inter-Office Memorandum Re: “Policy \nRegarding Native American pipe service”).  The uncontested evidence establishes that \nthe change in the communal pipe policy was based on the TDCJ’s compelling interest in \npreventing the spread of diseases. \nPlaintiffs  argue  that  the  TDCJ’s  new  pipe  ceremony  is  an  insufficient \naccommodation of their religious exercise under RLUIPA because personal participation \nin the pipe ceremony is essential.  Conceding the medical concerns, Plaintiffs argue that, \nwith respect to the least restrictive means, NA adherents should be allowed to possess \ntheir own personal pipe, and that the pipes could be stored in-between ceremonies by the \nprison chaplain in his or her office. \nThe TDCJ previously considered the idea of NA practitioners possessing personal \npipes, but concluded that the security risks and associated costs were too great, and that a \npipe smoked only by the ceremony leader is indeed the least restrictive means.  For \nexample, on September 8, 2011, Defendant Morris, Director Pierce, and numerous TDCJ \n22 / 39 \n\nofficials met to discuss various issues concerning Native American ceremonies.  (Appx \n111-114).  It was noted that pipe ceremonies were conducted at the Daniel Unit with a \nshared  pipe,  and  a  discussion  followed  regarding  medical  and  sanitation  issues,  and \nliability releases.  Id. at 111-112.  Security issues were discussed, and it was noted that \ntobacco distributed for the pipe ceremony at the Daniels Unit “kept disappearing.”  Id. at \n112.  The group discussed personal pipes for Native American offenders, but concluded \npersonal pipes would create too great of a security concern and burden, and the cost was \ngreat.  Id. at 113.  It was noted that the Cherokee Nation of Texas, the Lakota Nation and \nthe Apache Nation were not interested in assisting with the cost or donation of personal \npipes as they believed the offenders had “lost the right to take of the pipe.”  Id. at 114.  \nThe group reached a consensus that there be: (1) no communal offender pipes; (2) no \noffender-owned or possessed pipes allowed; (3) no storage of offender-possessed pipes or \npipe herbs by the TDCJ; and (4) Native Americans be provided with one pipe ceremony \nper month, with smoking to be done only by the volunteer/chaplain.  Id. at 114. \nRobert Eason is the TDCJ-CID Deputy Director of Prison and Jail Operations.  \n(Appx 425-445, Affidavit of Robert Eason).  Mr. Eason has been a TDCJ employee for \nover twenty years and has personal experience in the areas of prison staffing, budgets, \nand security review.  Id. at 425.  Mr. Eason related that, as part of the September 8, 2011 \nmeeting, TDCJ officials examined whether individual pipes would be feasible as the least \nrestrictive means, and it was noted at the onset that: “Pipe ceremonies in which offenders \nare allowed to smoke and handle contraband, such as pipes, tobacco and fire starting \nmaterials present serious challenges to the safety, security, and operation of a unit.”  Id. at \n23 / 39 \n\n428.  In addition, it would take considerable time to distribute, inventory, and track every \nNative American believer’s pipe for every pipe ceremony.  Id.  Additional logistical \nproblems are created by the necessity of cataloguing and storing several hundred pipes.  \nId. Mr. Eason explained that disposable pipes, assuming availability, would not be a \nfeasible alternative.   Id. This is  because tobacco is banned in Texas prisons, and is \nconsidered  valuable  contraband.    Id.  The  TDCJ  would  have  to  devote  extensive \nmanpower to ensure that none of the pipe ceremony participants stole or hid a pipe.  Id. \nAs to the McConnell Unit in particular, Mr. Eason pointed out that, due to the \nboom in the hydraulic fracturing industry on the Eagle Ford Shale, wages and the cost of \nliving have increased in the area, and the TDCJ is not able to compete with the oil and \ngas  salaries  available,  resulting  in  severe  staff  shortages.    (Appx  425-445,  at  437).  \nIndeed, on Mr. Eason’s last visit to the McConnell Unit on June 27, 2013, only 37 of the \n99  correctional  officers  working  there  were  assigned  to  that  unit;  the  other  62  are \nassigned to other units and were working overtime.  Id. at 47. \nIn Chance v. TDCJ, the Fifth Circuit considered essentially the same evidence as \nis now before this Court in regards to pipe ceremonies, including Dr. Williams’ medical \nopinion and Mr. Eason’s costs and security analysis.  Id. 730 F.3d at 412-414.  The Fifth \nCircuit concluded that the TDCJ had  met its burden of establishing that the ban on \ncommunal and individual pipes, and allowing only the ceremony leader to smoke the pipe \nat  ceremonies,  was  the  least  restrictive  means  to  conduct  pipe  ceremonies,  and \naccordingly, not in violation of RLUIPA.  In this case, the TDCJ has presented even more \ncompelling  evidence  to  support  this  same  conclusion  given  the  documented  staff \n24 / 39 \n\nshortages at the McConnell Unit.  Thus, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment in \ntheir favor on Plaintiffs’ RLUIPA challenge to the TDCJ pipe policy. \n(b)  Frequency of NA ceremonies. \nPlaintiffs claim that the Yellowtail decision mandated pipe ceremonies twice a \nmonth, with additional ceremonies for holy days.  Defendants do not object to the idea of \nbi-monthly services as well as holy days, but instead, offer the affidavit of TDCJ Director \nof Chaplaincy Operations Billy Pierce detailing the efforts and difficulties in hiring and \npaying contract chaplains, as well as finding qualified NA volunteers.  (Appx 402-409). \nDirector Pierce, who testified also in the Chance lawsuit, provides a detailed statement as \nto the Chaplaincy Department’s search for assistance from May 2009 through June 2013: \nTDCJ seeks to obtain as many volunteers as possible to assist \nwith NA services. The NA chaplains attempt to recruit volunteers to \nassist him or her in conducting prayer circles at as many additional \nunits as possible. I personally have made numerous attempts to locate \npersons who adhere to NA spirituality as both volunteers and paid \ncontract chaplains. I routinely send letters and make telephone calls to \neach of the 60+ known NA resource groups in the region, but rarely \nget  a  response  or  follow-up  commitment  from  these  tribes  and \norganizations.  \n \nAlong  with  sending  letters,  the  Chaplaincy  Department  has \ndiligently worked to try to find volunteers and contract chaplains to \nconduct NA services at McConnell and other units.  In 2009, a poster \nwas  developed  which  encourages  participating  volunteers  to  help \nother faith groups by serving as a volunteer or finding others who will \ndo so.  It was posted at all units at a location where volunteers would \nsee it. All TDCJ chaplains were enlisted in the recruitment effort.  At \nvolunteer appreciation events and other volunteer meetings, those in \nattendance  are  asked  to  help  by  being  volunteers  for  other  faith \ngroups.   \n \nIn addition, considerable efforts have been made to find either \nan unpaid volunteer or a paid contract chaplain to conduct monthly \n25 / 39 \n\nNA  services.    In  November  2009,  the  Chaplaincy  contacted  the \nAlabama  Coushatta  tribe:  there  was  no  response.    The  same  day, \nChaplaincy contacted  Sammy Gutierrez from the  Tigua Indians  of \nYselta del San Pueblo in El Paso, Texas.  Mr. Gutierrez said he was \nunavailable due to geographic location.  In February 2010, Chaplaincy \ncontacted Professor Lara-Lisa Condello of the Nicola Valley Institute \nof Technology, Institute of Indigenous Government of Canada.  She \nwas  unavailable  due  to  distance  and  geographic  location.    On \nFebruary 12, 2010, Chaplaincy contacted Dr. PeSheWa of the NA \nChurch of Strawberry Plains Tennessee.  She was unavailable due to \ndistance and geographic location, but offered her advice if needed.  In \nMarch  2010,  Chaplaincy  contacted  Kent  Frazier  from  “Without \nReservation” and he provided NA and Christian recordings.    \n \nIn  March  2010,  Chaplaincy  contacted  Dr.  Bob  Pierce  and \nproceeded to hire him as a NA contract chaplain as of May 2010.  In \nMay  2010,  Regional  Chaplain  Sam  Longoria  visited  with  Javier \nLoera, a tribal historic and preservation officer of the Tigua of Ysleta \ndel  Sur  Pueblo;  at  that  time  no  volunteers  were  available  due  to \ndistance  and  geographic  location.    NA  volunteer  Sam  Lonewolf \nstarting  providing  services  at  the  Michael  Unit  in  July  2010  until \nNovember  2010.    From  December  2010  through  March  2011, \nChaplaincy staff regularly recorded Dr. Bob Pierce’s services at the \ncentral  unit.    In  March  2011,  NA  contract  chaplain  Chari  Bouse \nstarted NA services at Michael, Hughes, Mountain View, Crain, and \nMurray  units.    In  October  2011,  NA  contract  chaplain  Richard \nVanWormer  started  religious  services  at  the  Stevenson  unit.    In \nNovember  2011,  NA  contract  chaplain  Ed  Hernandez  started  NA \nservices at Daniel, Connally, McConnell and Terrell units. \n \nIn April 2012, NA contract chaplain Chari Bouse recruited two \nvolunteers who went through volunteer training.  These volunteers \nattended one service and then decided that volunteering in prison was \nnot for them.  In March 2012, Chaplaincy contacted Doug Tapper \nfrom “Storyteller” radio program and he provided NA and Christian \nreadings.  In April 2012, NA contract chaplain Ed Hernandez was \nhired as a State Chaplain I at the Estelle Unit, where he performs a \nteaching circle once a month.  He provides NA services once a month \nfor offenders on the Terrell unit. He has also contacted the Alabama \nCoushatta tribe about volunteering and providing services for TDCJ. \nIn May 2012, Chaplaincy hired volunteer Shawna Mitchell as a NA \ncontract  chaplain  for  Daniel,  McConnell,  and  Connally  units.  She \nperforms the pipe ceremony once a month on each of the units. On \n26 / 39 \n\nNovember 10, 2012, the Committee on Native American Ministries \nfrom the United Methodist Church met with Chaplaincy and decided \nto  promote  a  First  Nations  Family  Heritage  Day  event  for  the \noffenders’ family members at the South Apache Museum in Houston, \nTexas.  Flyers were sent to each of the NA designated units to be \nplaced  on  the  Chaplaincy  Bulletin  Board  and  each  contract  NA \npresented  the  information  to  the  NA  offenders  during  their  NA \nservice.   \n \n(Appx 402-409, Pierce Aff’t, dated July 5, 2013, at 405-406). \nDirector  Pierce’s  affidavit  establishes  that  the  primary  reason  more  frequent \nservices cannot be held is not the result of any TDCJ policy, but instead, is the dearth of \navailable people willing and able to oversee religious ceremonies.  This same opinion is \nechoed  by  Defendant  Morris  in  his  affidavit.    (See  Appx  357-360).  The  summary \njudgment evidence shows that, pursuant to longstanding TDCJ policy, prisoners may \nonly organize religious gatherings under the proper supervision of a contract chaplain or \nqualified outside volunteer.  Despite efforts to hire NA chaplains and continuous requests \nto more than 60-plus NA resource groups in the region, Director Pierce was unable to \nobtain anything but religious recordings and vague commitments to help.  Similarly, \nDefendant Morris has traveled to various cities in Texas and has spoken with leaders of \nnumerous tribes in an attempt to find volunteers and/or recruit chaplains.  (Appx 358-59).  \nMore recently, these efforts have proven successful.  Indeed, following a low of monthly \nservices in 2012 at the McConnell Unit when only nine (9) NA services were conducted \nin a year, for the months of January 2013 through June 2013, the McConnell Unit had \nnineteen (19) NA services.  (Appx 403). \n27 / 39 \n\n The Fifth Circuit has considered challenges by inmates of other faiths regarding \nthe  frequency  of  services.  The  volunteer  policy  has  been  reviewed  and  upheld  on \nnumerous occasions.  See Mayfield, 529 F.3d at 613-14; McAlister v. Livingston, 348 \nFed. Appx. 923, 936-37 (5th Cir. 2009); Newby v. Quarterman, 325 Fed. Appx. 345, 350-\n52 (5th Cir. 2009).   Moreover, in Chance v. TDCJ, the Fifth Circuit expressly rejected \nthe plaintiff’s RLUIPA complaint about the frequency of services due to the limited \nnumber of outside volunteers, finding that the volunteer policy itself is reasonable and \nnecessary, and “that it is the least restrictive means of furthering TDCJ’s compelling \ninterest  in  prison  administration.”  Chance,  730  F.3d  at  414-15.    Although  Chance \ninvolved an inmate at the Michael Unit, the summary judgment evidence establishes that \nthe difficulties in finding qualified chaplains and volunteers is prevalent across Texas, \nadversely affecting all TDCJ prison units.  Much of the evidence in this case is the same \nor updated versions of the evidence presented in Chance, and accordingly, Plaintiffs’ \nRLUIPA claim based on the frequency of NA services is foreclosed.  \n(c)  Wearing long hair or a kouplock. \nAs previously noted, Plaintiffs successfully established that the TDCJs grooming \npolicy imposes a substantial burden on their religious exercise, and therefore, the burden \nshifts to Defendants to demonstrate that the challenged grooming policy  is the least \nrestrictive means of achieving the compelling government interest behind the policy.  \nGarner v. Kennedy, 713 F.3d 237, 241-42 (5th Cir. 2013).   Plaintiffs’ suggest that the \npolicy is not the least restrictive because women prisoners can wear their hair longer. \n28 / 39 \n\nDefendants  contend  that  the  grooming  policy  requiring  short  hair  serves  multiple \ncompelling TDCJ interests related to both security and costs. \nIn support of their position, Defendants offer, inter alia, the affidavit of Tracy \nBailey, the current senior warden at the Estelle Unit Huntsville, Texas.  (Appx 248-252, \nBailey Aff’t at 248).  Warden Bailey has been employed by the TDCJ for over 21 years \nand has held the positions of Correctional Officer, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Major \nand Assistant Warden.  Id.  Acknowledging that TDCJ women offenders can wear their \nhair longer than TDCJ men, Warden Bailey states that the policy “reflects the difference \nin the in-prison conduct of male and female offenders.”  Id.  The TDCJ has a much \ngreater male population than female.  Id. at 249.  From fiscal years 2009 to 2012, the \nmale population ranged from a low of 140,310 to a high of 144,036, while the female \npopulation ranged between a low of 11,954 to a high of 12,486, approximately a 12:1 \nratio.  Id. “Based on the vast difference in number of male and female offenders, it is \nlogical  that  male  disciplinary  offenses  of  escape,  attempted  escape,  assaults  on  a \ncorrectional officer would greatly outnumber the female number of disciplinaries.”  Id.  \nIndeed, the data demonstrates that a TDCJ male offender is 12 times more likely to \ncommit an offense than a female offender, and those offenses are more serious, involving \nphysical  injury  and/or  attempted  escapes.    Id.    Statistics  also  show  that  TDCJ  male \noffenders  demonstrate  a  higher  rate  per  capita  of  disobedience  and  violence  toward \ncorrectional  officers.    Id.  at  249-51.    Warden  Bailey  testified  that,  from  a  security \nperspective, because men are considerably more likely to be disciplined for a felony in \nprison than a female, the grooming policy must be strict.  Id. \n29 / 39 \n\nTDCJ Regional Director Robert Eason testified that the grooming policy impacts \nthe TDCJ’s compelling interests in both security and costs.  (Appx 425-445, at 441).  Mr. \nEason first observes that longer hair would necessarily result in increased searches and \nincreased physical contact between officers and offenders in the “strike zone.”  Id. at 438.  \nCurrently,  correctional  officers  are  trained  to  keep  an  arms-length  distance  between \nthemselves and offenders, and with an inmate’s hair no longer than the collar, visible \ninspections are effective and the officer need not touch the inmate.  Id.  If an inmate is \nallowed to wear long hair or even a braid, the hair must be searched, thus diverting the \nattention  of  the  officer  from  supervising  the  larger  population  to  focus  on  a  single \nprisoner.  Id.  In addition, searching an offender’s hair takes time, and time pressures \nimpact the entire unit schedule and the ability to move offenders.  Id. \nIn addition to exposing officers to more risk and negatively impacting time and \nschedules, Mr. Eason notes that long hair can be used against the offender himself if \nassaulted or otherwise engaged in a physical confrontation.  (Eason Aff’t, Appx at 439).  \nLong hair or a braid allows another inmate to grab the hair and control the victim. Id.9 \nMr. Eason points out that the TDCJ is regularly sued by prisoners for allegations of \nfailure to protect, and he states that the risk of long hair unnecessarily exposes the TDCJ \nto  increased  liability.    Id.  Finally,  Mr.  Eason  points  out  that  long  hair  would  make \n                                              \n9 This case is distinguished from the Garner case for that reason.  In Garner, the Plaintiff’s right, \nunder RLUIPA, to wear of a quarter-inch beard was upheld by the Fifth Circuit. Garner, supra.   \nUnlike the Plaintiff in Garner, Plaintiffs here seek to wear a kouplock of unlimited length on the \nback of the head, and have never suggested that they would be satisfied with quarter-inch \nkouplock.  \n30 / 39 \n\nidentification of prisoners both in and outside of prison (in the event of an escape), more \ndifficult.  Id. \nDefendants  also  offer  the  testimony  of  Jennifer  Gonzalez,  Assistant  Budget \nDirector of the TDCJ Business and Finance Division.  (Appx 450-52).  Using “54” as the \nnumber of active McConnell Unit NA faith adherents, Ms. Gonzalez calculated that the \nannual cost for searching the hair of those 54 inmates would be approximately $7,753.15.  \nId. at 450.  \nAlthough RLUIPA claims must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, the Fifth \nCircuit  has  effectively  foreclosed  Plaintiff’s  RLUIPA  claim  regarding  the  grooming \npolicy and their desire to wear long hair.  In Longoria v. Dretke, 507 F.3d 898 (5th Cir. \n2007),  the  plaintiff,  an  inmate  of  Mexican  and  Native  American  descent,  requested \npermission to grow his hair because the Great Spirit instructed him to do so. Id.  He \nadvised prison officials that he would not cut his hair due to his religious beliefs, but \nofficials told him he would not be exempt from the grooming policy.  He sued under \nRLUIPA and the district court dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous.  On appeal, the Fifth \nCircuit referenced its decision in Diaz v. Collins, 114 F.3d 69 (1997), that was decided \nunder RFRA, and held: “Because the test under RLUIPA is sufficiently the same as that \npreviously imposed under RFRA, we hold TDCJ-ID did not violate Longoria’s rights by, \npursuant to the grooming policy, denying him permission to grow his hair.”  Longoria, \n507 F.3d at 901. \nIn Thunderhorse v. Pierce, 364 Fed. Appx. 141 (5th Cir. 2010) (unpublished), the \nFifth Circuit again relied on Diaz and noted: \n31 / 39 \n\n… that prisoners may hide weapons and other contraband in their hair.  \n114  F.3d  at  73.    In  addition,  requiring  short  hair  makes  it  more \ndifficult  for  an  escaped  prisoner  to  alter  his  appearance  from \nphotographs that the TDCJ periodically takes of each inmate.  Id.  In \nlight of these concerns, we held that “the security interest at stake \ncannot meaningfully be achieved appropriately by any different or \nlesser means than hair length standards.  Id. \n \nThunderhorse, 364 Fed. Appx. at *4.  Thus, the Fifth Circuit has determined that, even if \nthe grooming policy interferes with a prisoner’s right to practice his religion, the policy is \nthe least restrictive means of furthering the TDCJ’s compelling interest in security and \nmanaging costs.  The evidence presented in this case falls squarely within that reasoning, \nand Plaintiffs fail to establish that a genuine issue of a material fact exists. \nSimilarly, Plaintiffs’ desire to wear a kouplock raises the same security concerns \nand costs as does their request to grow long hair.  The Fifth Circuit has held that RLUIPA \n“is not meant to elevate accommodation of religious observances over the institutional \nneed … to control costs,” and “controlling costs … involves compelling governmental \ninterests.”  DeMoss v. Crain, 636 F.3d 145, 154 (5th Cir. 2011) (quoting Baranowski v. \nHart, 486 F.3d 112, 125 (5th Cir. 2007).  The TDCJ is not obligated to spend large \namounts  of  money  in  order  for  Plaintiffs  to  wear  long  hair  or  a  kouplock.    The \nuncontroverted  summary  judgment  evidence  establishes  that  allowing  long  hair  or  a \nkouplock could increase the danger to correctional officers during a search as they must \nenter the “strike zone,” increase the risk of serious injury to NA offenders if attacked by \nanother inmate, and lead to increased liability exposure to the TDCJ.  The grooming \npolicy is the least restrictive means of promoting the TDCJ’s compelling interests in \nsecurity and costs. \n32 / 39 \n\n(d)  Medicine bags. \nFor the same reasons Plaintiffs’ RLUIPA claims must fail in regards to hair length \nand kouplocks, so must their challenge to the TDCJ policy that limits the wearing of their \nmedicine bags: the potential security risks and costs are too great.   \nIn 2009, TDCJ Chaplaincy Department Policy 05.02 included medicine bags as \napproved devotional items for offender possession.  (Appx 410-413, at 412).  However, \nthat same policy expressly limited an NA offender’s wearing of the bag “to the offender’s \ncell/dorm area or immediate bunk area in a dorm setting, and at all religious services.”  \nId.  at  412.    In  July  2012,  the  issue  of  medicine  bags  was  moved  to  Chaplaincy \nDepartment Policy 05.01, but the provisions concerning the wearing of the medicine bags \nremained virtually the same.  (Appx 343-356).  Specifically, as to “Medicine Bags or \nPouches,” Policy 05.01, Procedures II.D.1.  provides: “[w]earing the bag or pouch is \nlimited to the offender’s cell or immediate bunk area in a dorm setting, and at religious \nservices.”   (Appx at 346).    \nThe  TDCJ’s  security  and  cost  concerns  are  magnified  in  the  context  of  NA \nmedicine bags.  This is because under the TDCJ devotional items policy, correctional \nofficers are instructed to not touch the medicine bag or its contents.  (Appx 412).  Only \nvisual  inspection  is  permitted.    Id.    If  NA  practitioners  were  allowed  to  wear  their \nmedicine bags at all times, correctional officers would have to perform visual inspections \nof the bag upon every ingress and egress which would unarguably take additional time \nand hinder the scheduled operations of the prison.  Moreover, the very fact that the \nmedicine bag can and does contain items, raises numerous contraband and smuggling \n33 / 39 \n\nconcerns.  Finally, it is inevitable that other offenders would attempt to grab or take a \nmedicine bag from an NA adherent if worn throughout the day.  The medicine bag could \nalso result in choking of an inmate.  The medicine bag policy is justified by security and \nresource concerns, and there is no reason to question the TDCJ’s position that it is using \nthe least restrictive means of furthering those compelling state interests. \nC.  First Amendment claims against Morris in his individual capacity. \n  Plaintiffs are suing Mr. Morris in his individual capacity for monetary damages for \nalleged violations of their First Amendment rights.  Plaintiffs argue that Mr. Morris \narrived at the McConnell Unit in May 2009, and at that time, pipe ceremonies were in \nfact authorized by TDCJ policy.  Plaintiffs contend that Mr. Morris failed to perform the \nvery responsibilities he was hired by the TDCJ to perform, effectively denying plaintiffs \ntheir right to practice their religion as provided by the First Amendment. Defendant \nMorris seeks to dismiss plaintiffs’ claims on the grounds that they have failed to raise a \nconstitutional violation and argues that his actions were objectively reasonable, such that \nhe is entitled to qualified immunity. \n  The  defense  of  qualified  immunity  protects  government  officials  performing \ndiscretionary functions from “liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not \nviolate clearly established rights which a reasonable person would have known.” Harlow \nv. Fitzgerald,  457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982); Lytle v. Bexar County, Tex., 560 F.3d 404, 409 \n(5th Cir. 2009). Government employees are presumptively entitled to the defense of \nqualified immunity. Once asserted, the burden shifts to a plaintiff to demonstrate that \nqualified immunity does not bar their recovery. Salas v. Carpenter, 980 F.2d 299, 305 \n34 / 39 \n\n(5th Cir. 1992). A two-step process has traditionally been employed in evaluating the \ndefense  of  qualified  immunity.  Saucier  v.  Katz,  533  U.S.  194  (2001).  Under  the \ntraditional approach, a court must first consider whether “the facts alleged show the \nofficer’s conduct violated a constitutional right.” Id. at 201.  Second, if the plaintiff has \nsatisfied the first step, courts are required to decide whether the right at issue was “clearly \nestablished” at the time of the defendant’s alleged misconduct. Id. See also Brown v. \nStrain, 663 F.3d 245, 249 (5th Cir. 2011). “To be clearly established for purposes of \nqualified immunity, the contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable \nofficial would understand that what he is doing violates that right.” Brown v. Callahan, \n623 F.3d 249, 253 (5th Cir. 2010) (citations omitted). The Fifth Circuit has specified that \nthe  issue  for  a  court’s  consideration  with  respect  to  the  second  step  is  whether  the \ndefendant’s actions were objectively unreasonable in light of clearly established law at \nthe time of the conduct in question.  Short v. West, 662 F.3d 320, 325 (5th Cir. 2011) \n(citations omitted).  Conclusory allegations of wrong-doing fail to satisfy both the first \nand second requirement. Geter v. Fortenberry, 849 F.2d 1550, 1553 (5th Cir. 1988). \nMore recently, the Supreme Court held that a case may be dismissed based on either step \nin the qualified immunity analysis: “The judges of the district courts and the courts of \nappeals should be permitted to exercise their sound discretion in deciding which of the \ntwo prongs of the qualified immunity analysis should be addressed first in the light of the \ncircumstances in the particular case at hand.” Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 236 \n(2009); Short v. West, 662 F.3d 320, 325 (5th Cir. 2011). \n35 / 39 \n\nDefendant  Morris  first  argues  that  Plaintiffs  have  not  shown  a  constitutional \nviolation under the Free Exercise Clause. The Supreme Court has made it clear that \nprisoners must be provided “reasonable opportunities” to exercise their religious beliefs. \nCruz v. Beto, 405 U.S. 319 (1972) (per curiam). The Court has recognized, however, that \nlimits may be placed on the religious rights that must be afforded to inmates. In Turner v. \nSafley, 482 U.S. 78 (1987), the Supreme Court held “[l]awful incarceration brings about \nthe necessary withdrawal or limitation of many privileges and rights,” and “[w]hen a \nprison regulation impinges upon the inmates' constitutional rights, the regulation is valid \nif it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.” Id. at 89. Four factors that \nshould be considered in determining the reasonableness of a regulation: (1) there must be \na  valid,  rational  connection  between  the  prison  regulation  and  the  legitimate \ngovernmental  interest  put  forward  to  justify  it;  (2)  are  there  alternative  means  of \nexercising the right that remain open to prison inmates; (3) the impact accommodation \nwill  have  on  guards  and  other  inmates,  and  on  the  allocation  of  prison  resources \ngenerally; and (4) the absence of alternatives is evidence of the reasonableness of a prison \nregulation. Id. 89-91. Shortly after the Turner decision, the Supreme Court applied the \ntest  to  uphold  a  prison  policy  that  prevented  inmates  from  attending  Islamic  prayer \nservices.  O'Lone  v.  Estate  of  Shabazz,  482  U.S.  382  (1987).  The  Fifth  Circuit \nsubsequently  added  that  the  Supreme  Court  neither  held  any  single  factor  to  be \ndispositive, nor did it require all four factors to be met. Scott v. Mississippi Dept. of \nCorrections,  961  F.2d  77,  80  (5th  Cir.  1992).  The  first  factor  has  been  held  to  be \ncontrolling in these cases, and the other factors merely provided help in determining \n36 / 39 \n\nwhether the connection was logical. Id. at 81. More recently, the Fifth Circuit reaffirmed \nthe basic idea that rationality is the controlling factor. Mayfield, 529 F.3d at 607. \nBecause Plaintiff has not shown a violation under RLUIPA, he likewise has not \nshown a violation of the Free Exercise Clause because RLUIPA imposes a more stringent \nstandard than that of the First Amendment. Patel v. U.S. Bureau of Prisons, 515 F.3d \n807, 813 (8th Cir. 2008). Indeed, in Freeman, the Fifth Circuit expressed surprise that the \ninmate plaintiff brought religious claims under the First Amendment instead of RLUIPA \nbecause RLUIPA provides far greater challenges to prison regulations. 369 F.3d at 857 \nn.1. The Fifth Circuit has considered free exercise claims similar to Plaintiff’s claims and \nhave rejected them. See Freeman,  369 F.3d at 862-63 (rejecting challenge to  policy \nregarding volunteers); Baranowski, 486 F.3d at 121-22 (rejecting challenge to volunteer \npolicy);  Thunderhorse,  supra  (rejecting  requests  for  items  to  practice  NA  faith, \nobservance of holy days and pipe ceremony). As shown under the discussion of RLUIPA, \nthere are valid rational connections between the challenged policies and practices and \ncompelling governmental interests. The first factor in the Turner analysis is satisfied with \nrespect to all of Plaintiffs’ claims. \nPlaintiffs have failed to establish a constitutional violation in order to satisfy the \nfirst step in the qualified immunity analysis.  Moreover, Plaintiffs have not offered any \nevidence to suggest that Defendant Morris engaged in any actions that were objectively \nunreasonable in light of clearly established law.  Defendant Morris is entitled to summary \njudgment based on qualified immunity to the extent Plaintiffs have sued him in  his \nindividual capacity for monetary damages. \n37 / 39 \n\nD.  Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment. \nPlaintiffs filed a pleading entitled “Motion for Summary Judgment Default against \nDefendants.”  (D.E. 129).  In this pleading, Plaintiffs summarize the September 8, 2011 \nmeeting at which it was determined by TDCJ officials that the communal pipe would be \nsmoked only by the NA chaplain or service leader.  (See Appx 111-114, Chance litigation  \nmeeting held on 09/08/11).  Plaintiffs then argue that Defendants were required to file \ntheir summary judgment motion on or before July 8, 2013, but failed to do so, and \ntherefore, Plaintiffs should be granted summary judgment in their favor.  (D.E. 129 at 5). \nDefendants’ summary judgment motion was filed on July 8, 2013.  (See D.E. 120).  \nIn  addition,  Plaintiffs  were  provided  with  a  copy  of  the  Appendix  to  the  summary \njudgment motion.  (D.E. 150).  There are no grounds for default, and Plaintiffs’ motion \n(D.E. 129) is denied. \nVI.  Conclusion \n  The  summary  judgment  establishes  that  the  TDCJ  policies  challenged  by \nPlaintiffs,  --  the  Native  American  communal  pipe  policy,  the  requirement  that  all \nreligious gatherings be conducted by a chaplain or approved volunteer, the grooming \npolicy, and the devotional items policy, -- all impose substantial burdens on Plaintiffs’ \nreligious exercise.  However, the TDCJ has established with an abundance of uncontested \nand unchallenged evidence, that the policies are indeed the least restrictive means of \nfurthering the TDCJ’s compelling interests in maintain security and monitoring costs.  \nMoreover, because the protections offered by the First Amendment are more limited than \nthose  extended  under  RLUIPA,  Plaintiffs  claims  against  Defendant  Morris  in  his \n38 / 39 \n\nindividual  capacity  fail  as  a  matter  of  law.    Accordingly,  Defendants’  motion  for \nsummary judgment (D.E. 129) is granted, Plaintiffs’ motion (D.E. 125) is denied, and \nPlaintiffs’ claims are dismissed with prejudice.  Any and all other pending motions are \ndenied as moot. \n  ORDERED this 27th day of February, 2014. \n \n \n___________________________________ \nB.

They filed this lawsuit pursuant to the  \nReligious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc, \nand the First Amendment, alleging that their right to practice their Native American faith \nis being violated by TDCJ-CID.  Summary judgment in favor of Defendants was entered, \nand Plaintiffs have appealed (D.E. 158, 159, 161).  Pending is Plaintiffs’ motion for \nappointment of counsel on appeal (D.E. 178).   \n   In Bounds v. Smith, the Supreme Court held that a prisoner's constitutional right \nof access to the courts requires that the access be meaningful; that is, prison officials must \nprovide pro se litigants with writing materials, access to the law library, or other forms of \nlegal assistance.  Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817, 829 (1977).  There is, however, no \nconstitutional  right  to  appointment  of  counsel  in  civil  rights  cases.    Akasike  v. \nFitzpatrick, 26 F.3d 510, 512 (5th Cir. 1994); Branch v. Cole, 686 F.2d 264, 266 (5th Cir. \n1982).  Further, Bounds did not create  a \"free-standing right to a law library or legal \n1 / 3 \n\nassistance.\"  Lewis v. Casey, 116 S. Ct. 2174, 2180 (1996).  It is within the Court's \ndiscretion to appoint counsel, unless the case presents \"exceptional circumstances,\" thus \nrequiring the appointment.  28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(1); Cupit v. Jones, 835 F.2d 82, 86 (5th \nCir. 1987).  \n  A number of factors should be examined when determining whether to appoint \ncounsel.  Jackson v. Dallas Police Department, 811 F.2d 260, 261-62 (5th Cir. 1986) \n(citing Ulmer v. Chancellor, 691 F.2d 209 (5th Cir. 1982)).  The first is the type and \ncomplexity of the case.  Id.  Though serious, plaintiffs’ allegations are not complex. \n  The  second  and  third  factors  are  whether  the  plaintiffs  are  in  a  position  to \nadequately investigate and present their appeal.  Plaintiffs’ pleadings demonstrate that \nthey are reasonably intelligent, articulate, and able to describe the facts underlying their \nclaims.  They appear, at this stage of the case, to be in a position to adequately investigate \nand present their appellate arguments.     \n  The fourth factor which should be examined is whether the evidence will consist \nin large part of conflicting testimony so as to require skill in the presentation of evidence \nand in cross-examination.  Examination of this factor is irrelevant, as Plaintiffs’ claims \nwere disposed of prior to trial.  Plaintiffs claim to need an expert for purposes of their \nappeal, but the appeal must be decided on the record before the District Court, not new \nevidence from, as yet, unidentified experts.  This factor weighs against appointment of \ncounsel. \n  Plaintiffs have not shown that exceptional circumstances require the appointment \nof counsel.  In addition, there is no indication that appointed counsel would aid in the \n2 / 3 \n\nefficient and equitable disposition of the case.  The Court has the authority to award \nattorneys' fees to prevailing plaintiffs.  42 U.S.C. § 1988.  Plaintiffs are not prohibited \nfrom  hiring  an  attorney  on  a  contingent-fee  arrangement.    Plaintiffs’  motion  for \nappointment of counsel (D.E. 178) is denied without prejudice at this time.  \n  ORDERED this 16th day of May, 2014. \n \n \n___________________________________ \nB.

At the\nhearing, the following issues were clarified concerning plaintiff’s pending motions and the proper parties\nto this litigation:\n(1) Robbie Dow Goodman, TDCJ-CID # 758386, is added as a plaintiff to this lawsuit, and the\nClerk is instructed to note such on the docket, and to include Mr. Goodman in the style of this case. The\nmotion for joinder of party (D.E. 5), is GRANTED. \n(2) Plaintiff Goodman is granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis, and a separate collection\norder will be entered.1  \n(3) Plaintiff Davis orally moved to voluntarily dismiss defendants Ed Hernandez and Chaplain\nJones.  That motion is granted, and the Clerk is instructed to remove the names of these individuals from\nthe docket.\n1 Pursuant to the Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”), each prisoner-plaintiff must  pay the court\nfiling fee regardless of whether prisoners join in one action or each file an individual action.  See 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1915(b)(1); Boribourne v. Berge, 391 F.3d 852, 854-56 (7th Cir. 2004) (the PLRA obliges prisoners in a\njoint action seeking to proceed i.f.p. to pay one filing fee per prisoner, rather than splitting one filing fee);\nHubbard v. Haley, 262 F.3d 1194, 1197-98 (11th Cir. 2001) (PLRA did not permit group of prisoners\nproceeding i.f.p. in § 1983 action against correction officials to join claims and thereby divide single\nmandatory filing fee among them, regardless of prisoners’ contention that federal joinder rule governed and\nthat their claims arose out of the same transaction or occurrence and involved common questions of law). \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 16   Filed on 06/22/12 in TXSD   Page 2 of 2\n(4) Plaintiff Davis orally moved to amend the original complaint to sue the following\nindividuals in their individual and official capacities: \n(i) Clint Morris, Program Analyst for Designated Units.  Defendant Morris is alleged\nto have prohibited the traditional pipe ceremonies at the McConnell Unit, despite\na 2008 TDCJ-CID policy that specifically authorizes the pipe ceremonies;\n(ii) Madeleine Ortiz, Director of Rehabilitative Programs.  The Chaplaincy Department\nfalls under Ms. Ortiz’ supervision, and she is alleged to have approved the decision\nto prohibit traditional pipe ceremonies, in conflict with the policy; and\n(iii) Shawna Mitchell, McConnell Unit Chaplain.  Chaplain Mitchell is alleged to have\nrefused to follow the 2008 policy that permits traditional pipe ceremonies.  \nThe motion to amend is granted, and the Clerk is instructed to add these individuals as defendants\non the docket.\n(5) Plaintiff Davis moved orally to withdraw his retaliation claims and related request for\ninjunctive relief concerning those retaliation claims.  That motion is granted, and accordingly, the letter\nmotion for a restraining order (D.E. 11) is denied as moot.\n(6) Defendant Rick Thaler is sued in his official capacity only for injunctive relief.\n(7) Plaintiff’s motion to consolidate (D.E. 15) is denied as moot because a consolidation order\nwas entered on June 12, 2012 (D.E. 14).\nORDERED this 22nd day of  June, 2012.\n____________________________________\n B.

      "text": "Case 2:12-cv-00166   Document 80   Filed on 01/07/13 in TXSD   Page 1 of 4\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS \nCORPUS CHRISTI DIVISION \nTEDDY NORRIS DAVIS and  § \nROBBIE DOW GOODMAN,  § \n§ \nPlaintiffs,  § \n§ \nv.  §  CIVIL ACTION NO. 2:12-CV-00166 \n§ \nRICK THALER, ET AL.,  § \n§ \nDefendants.  § \nORDER ADOPTING MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION ON \nDEFENDANT CLINT MORRIS' MOTION TO DISMISS \nBefore the Court is Defendant Clint Morris' Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to FED. R. CIV. \nP. 12(b)(l) and 12(b)(6). (D.E. 51.)  United States Magistrate Judge B. Janice Ellington issued a \nmemorandum and recommendation to the Court in which she recommends that the Court grant in \npart and deny in part Morris' motion to dismiss. (D.E. 65.)  Defendant Clint Morris (Morris) \ntimely objected to the Magistrate Judge's memorandum and recommendation. (D.E. 74.)  Morris \nis  entitled to a de novo disposition by the District Judge of those portions of the Magistrate \nJudge's  memorandum  and  recommendation to  which timely  objections  were  filed.  FED.  R. \nCIV. P. 72(b); 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(l); Koetting v.  Thompson, 995 F.2d 37,40 (5th Cir. 1993). \nMorris objects that the memorandum and recommendation promotes an improper theory \nofliability based on respondeat superior. (D.E. 74 at 3.)  Morris asserts that Plaintiffs' complaint \nand response do not state a claim for the deprivation of a constitutional right, and the Magistrate \nJudge improperly recommends that the Court retain Plaintiffs' First Amendment claim based on \nvicarious liability. (Id. at 2.)  Morris argues that the only allegations against him are that he \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 80   Filed on 01/07/13 in TXSD   Page 2 of 4\nrecruited and supervised the volunteer chaplains, who refused to perform the traditional Native \nAmerican pipe ceremonies. (!d. at 2-3.)  Morris argues that he is therefore entitled to qualified \nimmunity because Plaintiffs were required to  show that Morris was personally involved in a \nconstitutional violation or in the creation of a policy that caused a constitutional injury, and \nPlaintiffs  complaint  merely  alleges  that  he  failed  to  recruit  qualified  volunteer  chaplains. \n(!d. at 4.)  The  Court  disagrees  with  Morris'  interpretation  of  the  memorandum  and \nrecommendation and Plaintiffs' factual allegations. \nMorris narrowly focuses on the factual allegations and arguments set forth in Plaintiffs' \ncomplaint and response to  the  motion to  dismiss, arguing that Plaintiffs failed to  show that \nMorris was personally involved in any constitutional violation or the creation or implementation \nof an  unconstitutional policy.  However,  a pro  se prisoner's civil  rights  complaint must be \nconstrued liberally, and any relevant factual allegations set forth at the Spears hearing may be \nincorporated into the complaint. Eason v.  Holt, 73 F.3d 600, 603 (5th Cir. 1996).  The Spears \nhearing permits the magistrate judge to dig beneath the pro se prisoner's complaint to ascertain \nwhether there exists a factual and legal basis for the claims. See Davis v.  Scott, 157 F.3d 1003, \n1005-06 (5th Cir. 1998) (\"the Spears procedure affords the plaintiff an opportunity to verbalize \nhis complaints, in a manner of communication more comfortable to many prisoners\"); Lowrey v. \nCollin  County Sheriffs Dept., No.  93-5081,  1994 WL  35601, at  *2  (5th Cir.  Jan. 26,  1994) \n(unpublished); Spears v.  McCotter, 766 F.2d at 181-82 (5th Cir. 1985) (\"We see no reason why \na district court may not ... refer the case to a magistrate to hold an evidentiary hearing 'in the \nnature of a motion for more definite statement' \"). \nDuring the Spears hearing before the Magistrate Judge on June 21, 2013, Plaintiff Teddy \nNorris Davis (Davis) alleged that Defendants Billy Pierce and Morris are the ones that had the \n2 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 80   Filed on 01/07/13 in TXSD   Page 3 of 4\nfinal say about the pipe ceremonies. (D.E. 26 at 22.)  Davis stated that Morris \"is the one that \nactually ceased the pipe ceremonies.\" (!d. at 24.)  Davis alleged that prison policy required that \ninmates be allowed one pipe ceremony per week, but the chaplains were ordered not to perform \nthe traditional Native American pipe ceremony, wherein the inmates would inhale the smoke and \nprayers from the pipe and then release them to the Creator. (!d. at 14-15, 19-20.)  Davis alleged \nthat the chaplains were only permitted to do a teaching ceremony where a pipe was present but \nnot actually lit and smoked by the inmates. (!d. at 20.) \nIn her memorandum and recommendation, the Magistrate Judge sets forth the following \nfactual  allegations asserted by Davis at the Spears hearing:  that Morris was responsible for \ndeveloping the policies and procedures that governed the Native American religious programs at \nthe prison; that Morris failed to use his position to assist inmates in the practice of their faith; and \nthat Morris' failure to develop and implement appropriate policies effectively denied Plaintiffs of \ntheir constitutional right to practice their religion. (D.E. 65 at 2, 7.)  Additionally, the Magistrate \nJudge indicates that Morris assisted in the creation of a new policy at the prison prohibiting pipe \nceremonies, which took effect in 2012. (!d. at 8.)  The Magistrate Judge concludes that Plaintiffs \nhave alleged sufficient facts that, if taken as true, state a First Amendment claim for the denial of \nthe  inmates'  constitutional  right  to  freedom  of religion.  (/d.)  The  Court  agrees.  Morris' \nobjections to the Magistrate Judge's memorandum and recommendation are OVERRULED. \nHaving reviewed the findings of facts, conclusions of law, and recommendations set forth \nin the Magistrate Judge's memorandum and recommendation (D.E.  65); Plaintiffs' complaint \n(D.E.  1); the transcript ofthe Spears hearing (D.E. 26); and all other relevant documents in the \nrecord, the Court ADOPTS as its own the findings and conclusions of the Magistrate Judge. \n3 \n\n.. \nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 80   Filed on 01/07/13 in TXSD   Page 4 of 4\nAccordingly, Defendant Clint Morris' Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to FED.

The plaintiffs in these cases \nchallenge the  same policies and practices  of the  Texas  Department of Criminal Justice, \nCorrectional Institutions Division (TDCJ-CID), which they assert have conflicted with their \nright to practice their Native American faith  in violation of the Religious Land Use and \n1/4 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 252   Filed on 03/02/18 in TXSD   Page 2 of 4\nInstitutionalized  Persons  Act  (RLUIPA),  42  U.S.C.  §  2000cc,  et  seq.,  and  the  First \nAmendment.  This matter is now before the Court for sua sponte consideration as to whether \nthese actions should be consolidated for trial. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nOn May 21,  2012,  Teddy Norris Davis filed a civil rights action alleging that the \nTDCJ  has  implemented  policies  that  prevent  him  from  ( 1)  growing  his  hair  long  or \nalternatively,  maintaining  a kouplock,  which  is  a continuously growing one  inch  square \nsection of hair at the base of the skull; (2) wearing a religiously significant \"medicine bag\" \nat  all  times;  and  (3)  smoking  a prayer pipe  during  Native  American  pipe  ceremonies. \n(2:12cv166, D.E.  1).  Robbie Dow Goodman was later granted leave to join as a plaintiff. \n(2:12cv166, D.E.  16).  On January  10, 2014 and January 21, 2014, respectively, William \nCasey and Raymond Cobb filed separate civil rights actions in which they also challenged, \npursuant to  RLUIPA  and the  First Amendment,  the  same policies.  (2:14cv13,  D.E.  1; \n2:14cv22, D.E. 1). \nIn each of the three actions filed by inmates who practice the Native American faith, \nthe  Court  only  allowed  the  RLUIPA  grooming  policy  claim  to  survive  past  summary \njudgment.  (2:12cv166, D.E. 231; 2:14cv13, D.E. 91; 2:14cv22, D.E. 38).  Specifically, the \nCourt ruled in each case that a fact issue exists as to whether TDCJ' s grooming policy is the \nleast restrictive means of maintaining the TDCJ's compelling security and costs interests. \n(!d.).  In the  first civil rights action,  Plaintiff Davis's claims were  dismissed for  lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction since he had been released from  TDCJ custody.  (2:12cv166, \n2/4 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 252   Filed on 03/02/18 in TXSD   Page 3 of 4\nD.E. 248).  Each of the cases filed by Plaintiffs Goodman, Casey, and Cobb are now ready \nto be set for trial on their respective RLUIPA grooming policy claims. \nII.  DISCUSSION \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 42(a) provides that if actions \"involve a common \nquestion of law or fact,\" the court may \"join for hearing or trial any or all matters at issue in \nthe actions,\" \"consolidate the actions,\" or \"issue any other order to avoid unnecessary cost \nor delay.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(a).  Consolidation does not merge the suits into a single action \nor change the rights of the parties; rather, consolidation is \"intended only as a procedural \ndevice used to promote judicial efficiency and economy\" and \"the actions maintain their \nseparate identities.\" See Frazier v. Garrison !.S.D., 980 F.2d 1514, 1532 (5th Cir.1993). \nThe decision to consolidate actions under Rule 42(a) is \"entirely within the discretion \nof the district court as it seeks to promote the administration of justice.\"  Gentry v.  Smith, \n487  F.2d  571,  581  (5th  Cir.1973).  Factors  for  the  court  to  consider  in  deciding  if \nconsolidation is  appropriate  include the  following:  \"( 1)  whether the  actions  are  pending \nbefore the same court, (2) whether common parties are involved in the cases, (3) whether \nthere are common questions of law and/or fact,  (4) whether there is  risk of prejudice or \nconfusion  if the  cases  are  consolidated,  and  if so,  is  the  risk outweighed by the risk of \ninconsistent adjudications of factual and legal issues if the cases are tried separately, and ( 5) \nwhether  consolidation will  conserve judicial resources  and  reduce  the  time  and  cost of \ntrying  the  cases  separately.\"  In  re  Enron  Corp.  Securities,  Derivative  &  \"ERISA\" \nLitigation,  Civ.  A.  Nos.  H-01-3624,  H-04-0088,  H-04-0087,  H-03-5528,  2007  WL \n446051, at *1 (S.D. Tex. Feb.7, 2007). \n3/4 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00166   Document 252   Filed on 03/02/18 in TXSD   Page 4 of 4\nIn  the  instant matter,  all  three  actions  are  pending in this  Court with two  of the \nactions assigned to the undersigned and the third action assigned to Magistrate Judge B. \nJanice Ellington by consent.  Judge Ellington agrees the cases should be consolidated and \nproceed before the undersigned.  The cases  involve common issues of law and fact,  and \nDefendant Lorie Davis is the common remaining defendant in each case.  Should the cases \nproceed separately,  there  is  a risk  of inconsistent adjudications  of the  factual  and  legal \nIssues.  Furthermore,  there  is  little  risk  of prejudice  or  confusion  if the  cases  are \nconsolidated.  Finally, consolidation will conserve judicial resources and reduce time and \ncost of trying the cases separately.  The Court concludes, therefore, that these cases shall be \nconsolidated for trial. \nIII.  CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Clerk of Court shall \nconsolidate  Civil  Actions  2:14-CV-13  and  2:14-CV-22  with  2:12-CV-166.  The \nconsolidated action shall proceed before the undersigned with the oldest case, Cause No. \n2:12-CV-166,  being the  lead case.  The  Clerk,  therefore,  is  DIRECTED to  REASSIGN \n2:12-CV-166 to the undersigned and to administratively close Cause Nos. 2:14-CV-13 and \n2:14-CV-22.  All future pleadings shall be filed in Cause No. 2:12-CV-166. \n~ \nSIGNED and ENTERED this  ~  day ofMarch, 2018. \n4/4 ",

      "text": "United States District Court\nSouthern District of Texas\nENTERED\nMarch 07, 2017\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS  David J. Bradley, Clerk\nCORPUS CHRISTI DIVISION \n \nTEDDY NORRIS DAVIS, et al,  §  \n  §  \n              Plaintiffs,  §  \nVS.  §     CIVIL ACTION NO. 2:12-CV-166 \n  §  \nLORIE DAVIS, Director, TDCJ-CID,  §  \n  §  \n              Defendant.  §  \n \nOPINION AND ORDER ON REMAND DENYING DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO \nSTRIKE, DENYING PLAINTIFFS' MOTION TO STRIKE, DENYING \nDEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON PLAINTIFFS’ \nRLUIPA GROOMING POLICY CLAIM AND RECOMMENDING REMAND OF \nTHE APPEAL FOR A TRIAL ON THE MERITS \n \nBy judgment issued as mandate entered on July 6, 2016, the Fifth Circuit affirmed \nin part, and vacated and remanded in part, this Court’s February 27, 2014 order granting \nDefendant’s  motion  for  summary  judgment  and  denying  Plaintiffs’  cross-motion  for \nsummary judgment.  (D.E. 191).  The Fifth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of Plaintiffs’ \nFirst Amendment claims as well as Plaintiffs’ claims under the Religious Land Use and \nInstitutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc, regarding his medicine bag \nand pipe ceremonies, but retained and remanded Plaintiffs’ RLUIPA claims challenging \nDefendant’s grooming policy prohibiting long hair or alternatively, the growing of a \nkouplock.  (D.E. 191 at p. 19).  See also Davis v. Davis, 826 F.3d 258, 2016 WL 3269089 \n(5th Cir. 2016). The remand required examination of two issues:  (1) whether Plaintiffs’ \nsummary  judgment  evidence  setting  forth  the  testimony  of  an  expert,  Mr.  George \nSullivan, exacted in an earlier trial before this Court on the identical issue of hair length, \n1 / 28 \n\nkouplocks and prison security, could properly be considered on summary judgment in \nthis proceeding; and (2) whether an exception to the grooming policy posed any risk to \nthe safety and security of the prison population and staff due to Plaintiffs' individual \nsecurity status.1  Id.   \nI.    JURISDICTION. \n  The Court has federal question jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§  1331.    Upon  consent  of  the  parties  (D.E.  87,  102),  this  case  was  referred  to  the \nundersigned United States magistrate judge to conduct all further proceedings, including \nentry of final judgment.  (D.E. 107).  See 28 U.S.C. § 636(c). \nII.   PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND. \nThe  procedural  history  of  this  case  has  been  fully  and  accurately  detailed  in \nprevious pleadings, as well as by the Fifth Circuit in its July 2016 opinion.  (See D.E. \n191, pp. 2-4).  Briefly, Plaintiff Teddy Norris Davis and Plaintiff Robbie Dow Goodman \nare  prisoners  incarcerated  in  the  Texas  Department  of  Criminal  Justice,  Criminal \nInstitutions Division (TDCJ-CID), and both are currently confined to the McConnell Unit \nin Beeville, Texas.   \nOn May 21, 2012, Davis filed a pro se 42 U.S.C. § 1983 complaint alleging that \ncertain  TDCJ  Defendants  were  burdening  his  right  to  practice  his  religious  faith  by \n                                              \n1 In its opinion, the Fifth Circuit noted that Defendant had failed to object by separate motion to \nthe admissibility of Mr. Sullivan’s testimony, but had objected only in her summary judgment \nmotion.  (D.E. 191, p. 10).  Defendant’s objection to Sullivan’s testimony is now before the \nCourt in a separate motion (D.E. 200), as well as in the additional briefing of both parties.  (See \nD.E. 200, 210).  The prior trial referred to the testimony given before United States Magistrate \nBrian Owsley in Odneal v. Pierce, et al., Civil Action No. 2:04-cv-00454. \n2 / 28 \n\nimplementing three TDCJ policies that prevented him from (1) smoking a prayer pipe \nduring Native American pipe ceremonies, (2) wearing a religiously significant “medicine \nbag” other than within his cell and while walking to and from religious ceremonies, and \n(3)  growing  his  hair  long  or  alternatively,  maintaining  a  kouplock,  which  is  a \ncontinuously growing one inch square section of hair at the base of the skull.  (See D.E. \n1).  Plaintiff Davis named as defendants the TDCJ-CID Director (then Rick Thaler, and \nnow Lorie Davis) and Bill Pierce, the Director of the TDCJ Chaplaincy Department. \nOn June 21, 2012, a Spears2 hearing was held with Plaintiff Davis, and he orally \nmoved to add as defendants (1) Clint Morris, the Program Analyst for Designated Units, \n(2) Madeline Ortiz, the Director of Rehabilitative Programs, and (3) Shawna Mitchell, the \nMcConnell Unit Chaplain.   \nOn June 22, 2012, Robbie Goodman was granted leave to join as a plaintiff.  (D.E. \n16).  Both Plaintiffs alleged that implementation of the challenged TDCJ policies caused \nthem  to  suffer  deprivations  of  their  religious  beliefs,  and  pointed  out  that  if  they \ndisobeyed the TDCJ policies they were subject to disciplinary action, including loss of \nprivileges and good time credits.  \nOn  February  11,  2013,  Plaintiffs  filed  an  Amended  Complaint.    (D.E.  88).  \nThereafter, following Plaintiffs’ consent to proceed before a magistrate judge, Plaintiffs \nvoluntarily dismissed all of their claims except their three RLUIPA challenges which \nsought injunctive and declaratory relief against TDCJ-CID Director Rick Thaler in his \n                                              \n2 Spears v. McCotter, 766 F.2d 179 (5th Cir. 1985). \n \n3 / 28 \n\nofficial capacity, and their First Amendment claim against Clint Morris, a TDCJ Program \nAnalyst.    After  Thaler  retired,  William  Stephens  was  substituted  as  the  TDCJ-CID \nDirector Defendant, and on May 5, 2016, the new TDCJ-CID Director, Lorie Davis, was \nappointed and substituted as a defendant in this action. \nOn February 27, 2014, this Court issued its Opinion and Order on Cross-Motions \nfor Summary Judgment and Final Judgment.  (D.E. 158, 159).  The undersigned found \nthat Plaintiffs are sincere practitioners of the Native American faith and that the policies \ncomplained  of  constituted  a  substantial  burden  on  their  religious  exercise.    The \nundersigned further found that Defendant had demonstrated that the challenged prison \nregulations  were  the  least  restrictive  means  of  furthering  compelling  governmental \ninterests, in particular, the prison’s interest in security, such that Plaintiffs’ request to \nmodify those policies be denied.   \nPlaintiffs appealed (D.E. 161), and by Order issued as mandate entered on July 6, \n2016, the Fifth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of Plaintiffs’ First Amendment claim and \nRLUIPA claims regarding the tobacco policy and medicine bag policy.  (D.E. 191).  The \nFifth Circuit remanded for further briefing on Plaintiffs’ challenge to the TDCJ-CID \ngrooming policy and the issue of whether or not this Court should have considered the \ntestimony of Mr. Sullivan and further to examine the individual security risk(s) posted by \neach Plaintiff.  \nOn July 12, 2016, this Court ordered the parties to submit additional briefing \nfollowing the Fifth Circuit’s remand.  (D.E. 192).   \n4 / 28 \n\nDefendants filed a motion for clarification of appeal (D.E. 161), and on August 8, \n2016, the Fifth Circuit clarified that only additional briefing was necessary and that there \nwas no need for a trial.  (D.E. 198). \nOn August 10, 2016, Defendant filed a motion to strike the testimony of Mr. \nGeorge Sullivan, (D.E. 200), and on September 28, 2016, Plaintiffs filed a motion to \nstrike some of the exhibits contained in Defendant's additional briefing. (D.E. 210).  The \nparties filed numerous replies and responses to replies, and all have been considered in \nconnection with the remand order. (D.E. 200-230). \nIII.    SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD. \n \n  Summary judgment is proper if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact \nand the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  FED. R. CIV. P.  56(c).  A \ngenuine issue exists “if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict \nfor the nonmoving party.”  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).  \nThe Court must examine “whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to \nrequire submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a \nmatter of law.”  Id. at 251-52.  In making this determination, the Court must consider the \nrecord as a whole by reviewing all pleadings, depositions, affidavits and admissions on \nfile, and drawing all justifiable inferences in favor of the party opposing the motion.  \nCaboni v. Gen. Motors Corp., 278 F.3d 448, 451 (5th Cir. 2002).  The Court may not \nweigh the evidence, or evaluate the credibility of witnesses.  Id.  Furthermore, “affidavits \nshall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in \nevidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the \n5 / 28 \n\nmatters stated therein.”  FED. R. CIV. P. 56(e); see also Cormier v. Pennzoil Exploration \n& Prod. Co., 969 F.2d 1559, 1561 (5th Cir. 1992) (per curiam) (refusing to consider \naffidavits that relied on hearsay statements); Martin v. John W. Stone Oil Distrib., Inc., \n819 F.2d  547, 549 (5th Cir. 1987) (per curiam) (stating that  courts cannot consider \nhearsay  evidence  in  affidavits  and  depositions).    Unauthenticated  and  unverified \ndocuments do not constitute proper summary judgment evidence.  King v. Dogan, 31 \nF.3d 344, 346 (5th Cir. 1994) (per curiam).   \n  The moving party bears the initial burden of showing the absence of a genuine \nissue of material fact.  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).  If the moving \nparty demonstrates an absence of evidence supporting the nonmoving party’s case, then \nthe burden shifts to the nonmoving party to come forward with specific facts showing \nthat a genuine issue for trial does exist.  Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio \nCorp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986).  To sustain this burden, the nonmoving party cannot \nrest on the mere allegations of the pleadings.  FED. R. CIV. P. 56(e); Anderson, 477 U.S. \nat 248.  “After the nonmovant has been given an opportunity to raise a genuine factual \nissue, if no reasonable juror could find for the nonmovant, summary judgment will be \ngranted.”  Caboni, 278 F.3d at 451.  “If reasonable minds could differ as to the import of \nthe evidence ... a verdict should not be directed.”  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 250-51. \n  The  evidence  must  be  evaluated  under  the  summary  judgment  standard  to \ndetermine whether the moving party has shown the absence of a genuine issue of material \nfact.  “[T]he substantive law will identify which facts are material.  Only disputes over \n6 / 28 \n\nfacts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly \npreclude the entry of summary judgment.”  Id. at 248.   \nIV.  DISCUSSION. \n  A.  Issue One: Testimony of George Sullivan. \n  In their cross-motion for summary judgment/summary judgment response (D.E. \n129), Plaintiffs relied on the prior testimony and expert report of a retired prison official, \nGeorge Sullivan, elicited during a trial of another case held before Magistrate Judge \nBrian Owsley,  to support their argument that kouplocks do not  pose risks to prison \nsecurity sufficient to warrant their prohibition by TDCJ-CID’s grooming policy.  (D.E. \n143).    Without  squarely  addressing  the  admissibility  of  Plaintiffs’  proposed  expert \ntestimony, this Court granted summary judgment in favor of Defendant, thus effectively \nignoring  Sullivan’s  proffered  testimony.  (D.E.  158).    The  Fifth  Circuit  vacated  and \nremanded on Plaintiffs’ claim that TDCJ’s grooming policy violates their right under \nRLUIPA to wear a kouplock consistent with their Native American faith, but instructed \nthis Court to make a specific finding as to the admissibility of Sullivan’s testimony.  \n(D.E. 191). \n  Defendant Davis moves to strike Plaintiffs’ proffered expert testimony arguing \nthat the testimony cannot and could not have properly been considered because it was \noffered in an improper manner and form under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 26(a)(2) \nand 56(c), and is unreliable under Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) 702 and Daubert v. \nMerrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, 509 U.S. 579 (1987).  (See D.E. 200, D.E. 205, pp. 18-\n7 / 28 \n\n28).  Sullivan’s testimony is found at the following entries in this case:  D.E. 143-1, pp. \n14-17, 20-25, 27-28, 30; D.E. 143-2, pp. 1, 4, 12, 18; D.E. 143-3, p. 14, 17-18, and 24. \n  (1)  Standard of Review. \n  Trial  courts  have  wide  latitude  when  ruling  on  the  admissibility  of  expert \ntestimony.  Hammond v. Coleman Co., 209 F.3d 718 (5th Cir. 2000).  Because trial courts \nserve as gatekeepers, their exclusion of expert testimony is reviewed only for an abuse of \ndiscretion.  See, e.g. Boyd v. State Farm Ins. Cos., 158 F.3d 326, 331 (5th Cir. 1998) \n(“With respect to expert testimony … its ruling must be sustained unless manifestly \nerroneous.”).  Here, no specific ruling was made on the admissibility of Sullivan’s report \nand so the Court addresses the issue for the first time.  \n  (2)  Defendant's Motion to Strike. \n  Defendant argues that Plaintiffs' summary judgment evidence setting forth the \nprior testimony of George Sullivan could not properly be considered as expert testimony \non summary judgment because Plaintiffs retyped or merely referenced portions of Mr. \nSullivan’s expert report, deposition, and prior trial testimony from a previous trial held in \nthe Corpus Christi Division, Odneal v. Pierce, et al., Civil Action No. 2:04-cv-00454, \nthus failing to satisfy either the procedural requirements of FED. R. CIV. P. Rules 26(a)(2) \nand 56(c)(1)(A) or the reliability requirements of Daubert and FED. R. EVID. 702.  \n  (a)  FED. R. CIV. P. 26. \n  As inmates proceeding pro se, Plaintiffs are excused from the duty to participate in \ninitial disclosures.  See FED. R. CIV. P. 26(a)(1)(B)(iv), excusing from initial disclosures \n“an action brought without an attorney by a person in the custody of the United States, \n8 / 28 \n\nstate, or a state sub-division.”  Although excused from initial disclosures, pro se plaintiffs \nare  not  excused  from  complying  with  FED.  R.  CIV.  P.  26(a)(2)(D)(ii)  in  regards  to \ndisclosing expert witnesses.  That rule provides: \n  (D)  Time to Disclose Expert Testimony.  … absent a stipulation or a \n  court order, the disclosures must be made: \n \n  (ii) if the evidence is intended solely to contradict or rebut evidence \n  on  the  same  subject  identified  by  another  party  under  Rule \n  26(a)(2)(B) or (C), within thirty days after other party’s disclosure. \n \nFED. R. CIV. P. 26(a)(2)(D)(ii). \n  In this case, on September 13, 2012, Defendant disclosed her expert witnesses in \nher Initial Disclosures, along with a statement of proposed testimony.  (D.E. 36). (See \nalso D.E. 206-11, pp. 1-10).  Defendant argues that Plaintiffs were thus required to \ndisclose the expert testimony of Mr. Sullivan that they intended to use to rebut that \ntestimony within thirty days, by October 13, 2012.  Plaintiffs first produced Sullivan’s \ntestimony on October 28, 2013, fifteen days past the Rule 26 deadline.  However, the \nmere fact that Plaintiffs’ expert testimony was produced fifteen days late does not equate \nwith a punishment of striking Plaintiffs’ expert witness testimony.3  The essential inquiry \nis whether or not Defendant was prejudiced or harmed from this fifteen day delay.  Under \nRule  37(c)(1),  if  a  party  fails  to  provide  expert  disclosures  within  the  established \ndeadlines, “the party is not allowed to use the information or witness to supply evidence \n                                              \n3 Plaintiffs argue that they were unable to produce the expert report in full because they are \nindigent and were repeatedly denied requests for certified copies of Sullivan’s reports such that \nthey had to hand-write much of the information themselves.  (D.E. 217, p. 23).  Defendant does \nnot refute this, and the docket indicates that Plaintiffs were denied copies of the transcripts at the \nCourt’s cost.  \n \n9 / 28 \n\non a motion, at a hearing, or at trial, unless the failure was substantially justified or is \nharmless.  (emphasis added). \n  In this case, Mr. Sullivan’s testimony posed neither surprise nor harmful error to \nDefendant.  Mr. Sullivan’s testimony had been presented in an earlier Native American \nRLUIPA long-hair case to which the Director was a party.  Moreover the fifteen day \ndelay in Plaintiffs’ producing the testimony caused no harm to Defendant, and Defendant \ndid not file a motion to strike the expert testimony, but only raised the issue in her Reply \nto Plaintiffs’ summary judgment motion.  That is, Defendant had plenty of time to review \nthe testimony offered by Plaintiffs and to prepare her objections thereto such that there \nwas neither surprise nor harmful error.  Defendant’s Rule 26 as well as Rule 37(c)(1)(A) \nobjections to Plaintiffs’ expert testimony is overruled. \n  (b)  Rule 56(c). \n  The Fifth Circuit has held that a trial court may rely on certified transcripts of \nprior testimony in deciding a motion for summary judgment.  See, e.g., Tremont LLC v. \nHalliburton Energy Services, Inc., 696 F. Supp. 2d 741, n. 22 (S.D. Tex. 2010) (citing \nKelley v. Price-Macemon, Inc., 992 F.2d 1408, 1415 n. 12 (5th Cir. 1993).  Defendant \nmaintains that un-certified transcripts are inadmissible hearsay. \n  Generally, pro se plaintiffs are given leeway in the prosecution of their cases.  The \nFifth Circuit noted as such in the instant case, pointing to this Court’s December 20, 2013 \norder which allowed Plaintiffs to “hand copy all documents sent to the Clerk.”  (D.E. \n150).  Defendant argues that this order should not be construed as giving permission to \nPlaintiffs to submit their hand-written materials as proper summary judgment evidence; \n10 / 28 \n\nhowever, the Order has effectively already done as such.  Moreover, a comparison of \nPlaintiff’s handwritten copies to the transcripts submitted in  Odneal  reveals that the \ncopies are identical, and Defendant has failed to identify or point out any portions that \nincorrectly quote Mr. Sullivan or attempt to mislead the Court.  It is noted that the Odneal \ntrial was against the TDCJ-CID Director, who had an opportunity during the Odneal trial \nto fully cross examine Mr. Sullivan, as well as to rebut Mr. Sullivan's testimony with \ntestimony of the Director's  own experts.  In this case, given the in forma pauperis status \nof the Plaintiffs, and the fact that the court may take judicial notice of the proceedings \nand the entire testimony of Mr. Sullivan,4 fairness dictates that the testimony may be \nexamined in connection with the summary judgment motion. \n  (c)  Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and Daubert.  \n  Defendant also challenges Mr. Sullivan’s prior testimony and expert report as \ninadmissible under FED. R. CIV. P. 702.  When presented with expert testimony, the \nCourt  must  determine  at  the  onset  if  the  proponent  of  the  evidence  has  proven  its \nadmissibility  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence.    Daubert  v.  Merrell  Dow \nPharmaceuticals, 509 U.S. 579, 592 n.10 (citing FED. R. EVID. 104(a) and Bourjaily v. \nUnited States, 483 U.S. 171, 175-76 (1987)).  To prove admissibility of an expert opinion \non scientific, technical, or specialized knowledge, the proponent’s evidence must satisfy \n                                              \n4 A court may sua sponte take judicial notice of records in related cases, as long as it judicially \nnotices only those adjudicative facts that cannot reasonably be questioned. Moore v. Estelle, 526 \nF.3d 690, 694 (5th Cir. 1976); In re Base Holdings, LLC, No. 3:13-CV-1584-D, 2014 WL \n895403 at n. 5 (N.D. Tex. 2014). See also In re Moity, 320 Fed. App'x 244, 249 (5th Cir. \n2009)(\"One court may take judicial notice of another court's judicial actions.\") \n \n11 / 28 \n\nthe reliability standard.  FED. R. EVID. 702; Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137 \n(1999). \n  To determine reliability under FED. R. EVID. 702, courts consider whether the \nexpert (1) has “sufficient facts or data” underlying the testimony; (2) applied “reliable \nprinciples and methods,” and (3) reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts \nof  the  case.    Federal  courts  applying  Rule  702  should  look  closely  and  directly  at \nevidence, and consider a wide range of factors bearing on reliability—courts are gate-\nkeepers and must access the validity and reliability of scientific evidence.  Daubert, 509 \nU.S. at 590-92.  \n  Kumho clarified Daubert’s ambit as including specialized knowledge (e.g. prison \nsecurity).  509 U.S. at 590-91.  The Kumho court emphasized that courts should not only \nconsider the specific factors identified in Daubert where they reasonably measure the \nreliability of expert testimony, but also, given the particular nature and facts of the case, \nshould  consider  other  factors  weighing  on  whether  the  expert’s  conjectures  have  “a \nreliable basis in the knowledge and experience of the relevant discipline.”  Id. at 591.   \n  Merely qualifying an expert does not pave the way for whatever the expert might \nwant to say  about the case.    Daubert,  590 U.S. at 595-96.   The expert  must reach \nconclusions that are consistent with those reached by others applying similar analyses to \nsimilar facts.  Id.  Disparity is a red flag—it suggests that something about the method or \nmanner has gone wrong and that reliability has not been met. \n  Other “red flags … caution against certifying an expert [that] include reliance on \nanecdotal evidence, improper extrapolation, failure to consider other possible causes, lack \n12 / 28 \n\nof testing, and subjectivity as well as whether “a purported expert’s opinion was prepared \nsolely for litigation.”  Newell Rubermaid, Inc. v. Raymond Corp., 675 F.3d 521, 527 (6th \nCir.  2012).    These  red  flags  echo  the  Supreme  Court’s  reasoning  in  Joiner,  which \nexpanded the reliability inquiry to include an assessment of the fit between an expert’s \nspecific opinions and the data, principles, and methods from which they are derived.  \nGeneral Electric Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136, 146 (1997) (“…[n]either Daubert [n]or the \nFederal Rules of Evidence requires a district court to admit opinion evidence that is \nconnected to existing data only by the ipse dixit of the expert”). \n  Defendant  has  failed  to  offer  any  evidence  to  refute  the  reliability  of  Mr. \nSullivan’s expertise.  Mr. Sullivan testified in the  Odneal case that he has 55 years \nexperience in state and federal corrections.  ( See Odneal, Case No. 2:4-cv-454, D.E. 157, \npp. 1-20).  He worked as a warden and superintendent at the Oregon State Correctional \nInstitution from 1969 through 1984.  (Odneal, D.E. 157, p. 3).  He served as a warden in \na  New  Mexico  prison  until  1987,  and  thereafter,  as  Deputy  Director  in  charge  of \nstatewide prison operations in Colorado until 1994.  Id. at 3-4.  While with the Oregon \nprison system, Sullivan implemented a Native American rights policy, including personal \nchoice in hair length.  Id. at 3.  The Oregon prisons had no security incidents concerning \nhair length.  Id.  He has conducted audits of state and federal prisons, and has served as a \nprofessional corrections consultant and expert witness, having served on the accreditation \nspecial task force as well as a special committee concerning protective custody.  Id. at p. \n7.  The uncontested summary judgment evidence establishes that Mr. Sullivan is an \nexpert in prison operations and safety. \n13 / 28 \n\n  Defendant argues that she was denied the opportunity to review properly Mr. \nSullivan’s prior trial testimony because Plaintiffs provided only their hand-copied and \nselected excerpts of Sullivan’s testimony rather than a complete certified trial transcript \nplus  any  written  reports  of  Mr.  Sullivan.    This  argument  is  without  merit  however \nbecause, as mentioned earlier, the Director had access to Mr. Sullivan's testimony in \nOdneal and in other trials held against the Director in this court.5 \n  Moreover, Plaintiff’s contention that she did not have access to Mr. Sullivan’s \nreport and findings is simply not true.  In Odneal v. Dretke, 435 F. Supp. 2d 608 (S.D. \nTex., Jun. 21, 2006) (C.A. No. 2:04-454), this Court dismissed Odneal’s claims regarding \nwearing a medicine bag, growing long hair, and engaging in pipe ceremonies finding the \nTDCJ  policies  prohibiting  such  practices  were  reasonably  related  to  the  TDCJ’s \nlegitimate interest in security.  On appeal, the Fifth Circuit affirmed the pipe ceremony \nclaim but remanded the hair and medicine bag claims for further development.  Odneal v. \nPierce, 324 Fed. Appx. 297 (5th Cir. 2009).   \n  On remand, Odneal was appointed counsel, and he abandoned his medicine bag \nclaim, retaining only his long hair/kouplock claims.  At summary judgment, the TDCJ \nproduced  evidence  that  kouplocks  could  present  security  issues  concerning  inmates’ \nidentification and provide a hiding place for secreting contraband.  Odneal countered this \nevidence with the testimony of Mr. Sullivan, and summary judgment was denied.  See \nOdneal v. Pierce, 2010 WL 3359535 (S.D. Tex. 2010).  On December 13-14, 2010, a \n                                              \n5 Garner v. Morales, et al., Civil Action No. 2:06-cv-0218, affirmed, Garner v. Kennedy, 713 \nF.3d 237 (5th Cir. 2013). \n14 / 28 \n\nbench trial was conducted before Magistrate Judge Owsley.  Before a ruling was entered, \nthe TDCJ transferred Odneal to a prison in Minnesota where he would be permitted to \ngrow his hair, and therefore, the kouplock issue became moot and remains undecided.  \n(See Odneal v. Pierce, 2011 WL 2678940 (S.D. Tex. Jul. 7, 2011) (Case No. 2:04-454, \nD.E. 195, Order of Dismissal).  Although the Odneal case ultimately had no bearing on \nthe  merits  of  this  case,  it  does  show  that  Defendant  had  access  to  Mr.  Sullivan’s \ntestimony and reports and that this Court had found his testimony and reports sufficient to \nraise a genuine issue of material fact for purposes of summary judgment.   \n  On remand, the Court now finds that Defendant’s motion to strike the testimony of \nGeorge Sullivan (D.E. 200) should be denied and in all things is denied.  Defendant has \nhad ample opportunity to review Sullivan’s trial testimony and reports in certified forms \nand to assure herself that Plaintiffs’ hand-written submissions, though not complete, are \nnot misleading and adequately raise a fact issue on their own.  Thus, the testimony of Mr. \nSullivan is admitted. \n  B.  Issue Two:   Evaluating the Marginal Interests of Each Plaintiff Under \n        the RLUIPA.  \n \n  In  its  Order  of  Remand  (D.E.  191),  the  Fifth  Circuit  noted  remand  was  also \nappropriate because “…the district court did not appear to consider Plaintiffs’ specific, \nindividual status as low custody level inmates in relation to their theory that the grooming \nrestrictions are unnecessary as applied to them.\"  (D.E. 191, p. 16).    \n(1)  Section 3 of the RLUIPA. \nSection 3 of the RLUIPA concerns institutionalized persons and states: \n15 / 28 \n\nNo government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious \nexercise of a person residing in or confined to an institution as defined \nin section 1997 of this title, even if the burden results from a rule of \ngeneral  applicability,  unless  the  government  demonstrates  that \nimposition of the burden on that person— \n \n(1)  is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and  \n \n(2)  is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling \ngovernmental interest. \n \n42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1(a).  The Act broadly defines “religious exercise” to include “any \nexercise of religion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious \nbelief.”  Id. § 2000cc-5(7)(A).   \n  RLUIPA, which provides a private cause of action, id., § 2000cc-2(a), implements \na burden-shifting framework.  Chance v. Tex. Dep’t of Crim. Justice.  The plaintiff’s \ninitial burden is two-fold: he or she must show that (1) the relevant religious exercise is \n“grounded in a sincerely held religious belief” and (2) the government’s action or policy \n“substantially burden[s] that exercise” by, for example forcing the plaintiff “to ‘engage in \nconduct that seriously violates [his or her] religious beliefs.’”  Holt v. Hobbs,         U.S.  \n        ,        , 135 S. Ct. 853, 862 (2015) (quoting Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.,___      \nU.S.          ,  134  S.  Ct.  2751,  2775  (2014)).    If  the  plaintiff  carries  this  burden,  the \ngovernment  bears  the  burden  of  proof  to  show  that  its  action  or  policy  (1)  is  in \nfurtherance of a compelling governmental interest and (2) is the least restrictive means of \nfurthering that interest.  42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1(a); Holt, 135 S. Ct. at 863. \n  Despite  RLUIPA’s express purpose  of protecting the religious observances of \nindividualized persons, the statute does not give courts carte blanche to second-guess the \n16 / 28 \n\nreasoned judgments of prison officials.  Indeed, while Congress enacted the RLUIPA to \naddress the many “frivolous or arbitrary” barriers impeding institutionalized persons’ \nreligious exercise, it nevertheless anticipated that courts entertaining RLUIPA challenges \n“would  accord  ‘due  deference  to  the  experience  and  expertise  of  prison  and  jail \nadministrators.’”  Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S.709, 716-17 (2005) (quoting 146 Cong. \nRec.  16698,  16699  (2000)  (joint  statement  of  Sens.  Hatch  and  Kennedy  on  the \nRLUIPA)).  The Supreme Court has cautioned that “[w]e do not read RLUIPA to elevate \naccommodation of religious observances over an institution’s need to maintain order and \nsafety,” and “an accommodation must be measured so that it does not override other \nsignificant interests.”  Id. at 722.  The Court further instructed: \nWe have no cause to believe that RLUIPA would not be applied in an \nappropriately  balanced  way,  with  particular  sensitivity  to  security \nconcerns.  While the Act adopts a “compelling governmental interest” \nstandard,  context  matters  in  the  application  of  that  standard.  \nLawmakers  supporting  RLUIPA  were  mindful  of  the  urgency  of \ndiscipline,  order,  safety,  and  security  in  penal  institutions.    They \nanticipated  that  courts  would  apply  the  Act’s  standard  with  due \ndeference  to  the  experience  and  expertise  of  prison  and  jail \nadministrators in establishing necessary regulations and procedures to \nmaintain  good  order,  security  and  discipline,  consistent  with \nconsideration of costs and limited resources. \n \nId. at 722-23 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  This deference is not, \nhowever, unlimited, and “policies grounded on mere speculation, exaggerated fears, or \npost-hoc  rationalizations  will  not  suffice  to  meet  the  Act’s  requirements.”  Rich  v. \nSecretary, Florida Dep’t of Corrections, 716 F.3d 525, 533 (11th Cir. 2013) (internal \nquotation marks omitted). \n   \n17 / 28 \n\n(2)  Holt v. Hobbs. \nIn Holt v. Hobbs, 135 S. Ct. 853 (2015), the Supreme Court considered a RLUIPA \nchallenge to the Arkansas Department of Corrections’ (ADOC) no-beard policy. The \npolicy  prohibited  inmates  from  wearing  facial  hair  other  than  a  “neatly  trimmed \nmustache.”  Id. at 860.  The policy made no religious exceptions, but did allow inmates \nwith diagnosed dermatological conditions to wear a ¼-inch beard.  Id.  In accordance \nwith his Muslim faith, Gregory Holt sought permission to grow a ½-inch beard.  Id. at \n859, 861.  The ADOC denied Holt’s request and he filed suit under RLUIPA.  Id. at 861.  \nFollowing an evidentiary hearing, the district court dismissed Holt’s complaint for failure \nto state a claim, and the Eighth Circuit affirmed.  Id.  The Supreme Court reversed, \nholding that ADOC’s grooming policy violated RLUIPA as applied to Holt.  Id. at 867 \n(emphasis added). \nThe Court reasoned that the ADOC’s stated justification for the policy, preventing \nthe flow of contraband, would not be seriously compromised by permitting Holt to grow \na ½-inch beard.  Id. at 863.  In reaching this conclusion, the Supreme Court noted that \npermitting  a  religious  accommodation  to  a  grooming  policy  may  still  allow  prison \nofficials to maintain security because RLUIPA allows an institution “to withdraw an \naccommodation if the claimant abuses the exemption in a manner that undermines the \nprison’s compelling interests.”  Id. at 867. \nA panel of the Fifth Circuit applied Holt to affirm a decision out of the Eastern \nDistrict of Texas granting a Muslim inmate the right to grow a four-inch beard and wear \nhis kufi throughout TDCJ’s facilities in Ali v. Stephens, 2016 WL 1741573 (E.D. Tex. \n18 / 28 \n\nMay, 2, 2016).  In affirming the bench trial decision, the Fifth Circuit reviewed the \ndistrict court’s findings as to the TDCJ grooming policy and evaluated the evidence \nsupporting the TDCJ’s concerns over preventing the transfer of contraband, facilitating \ninmate identification, controlling costs, and ensuring orderly program administration, all \nconcerns that were raised in the instant litigation with Davis and Goodman.  In fact, \nGeorge Sullivan testified as an expert in the Ali bench trial that self-searches and visual \ninspections of longer beards are effective methods for revealing contraband.  Ali, 2016 \nWL 1741573, at *8.  After examining the specific exemption requested (a four-inch \nbeard), the Fifth Circuit found that the TDCJ’s ban on the wearing of such a beard as to \nAli was not the least restrictive means of furthering these interests.  It was noted that Ali \nis a “trusty” inmate which is the lowest security level classification, and that he lives in a \ndormitory outside of the Michael Unit’s fence line.  Id. \nIn light of Holt, TDCJ’s asserted compelling interests must be examined in light of \nthe particular characteristics of each Plaintiff, including the Plaintiff’s security risk status \nand the particular risks of the specific exemption requested.  Holt, 135 S. Ct. at 863.   \n(3)  Plaintiffs’ Security Risk Status.   \nThe Fifth Circuit has ordered the Court to evaluate the grooming policy as to each \nPlaintiff, including in the context of each Plaintiff’s particular security classification.  \n(D.E. 191, p. 19).  Plaintiffs have presented their security classification.  (D.E  217). \nDefendant  objects  to  this  evidence  arguing  that  Plaintiffs  are  raising  their  low  risk \n“allegation” for the first time in response to Defendant’s summary judgment motion such \nthat it is not before the Court properly and should not be considered.  (D.E. 205, pp. 16-\n19 / 28 \n\n19).  Defendant’s argument is without merit.  Plaintiffs were ordered by the Fifth Circuit \nand also by this Court in its July 12, 2016 order for additional briefing (D.E. 192) to \nprovide  evidence  regarding  their  security  status,  and  they  filed  their  briefing  on \nNovember 21, 2016.  (D.E. 217).  Moreover, the security status of Plaintiffs is a fact issue \nin which their RLUIPA claim is evaluated; it is not a separate claim as suggested by \nDefendant.  Plaintiffs' motion to strike (D.E. 210) is denied for the same reasons. \nWarden Barber explains that, in evaluating an inmate’s custody level,6 several \nfactors are considered including (1) an offender’s current institutional behavior, (2) his \ncurrent offense and (3) his current sentence length.  (D.E. 206-3, Barber Aff’t, p. 5).  \nDisciplinary  convictions  may  negatively  affect an  inmate’s custody  designation.   Id.  \nSimilarly,  offenders  who  comply  with  the  rules  and  progress  without  receiving  a \ndisciplinary case may be assigned a less restrictive custody level.  Id. \n(a)  Plaintiff Davis. \n  Current offense and sentence length. \nPlaintiff Davis is serving a 50-year sentence for indecency with a child making \nsexual contact.  (D.E. 206-1, p. 2).  He is currently eligible to be reviewed by the Texas \n                                              \n6  According  to  the  TDCJ-CID  Prisoner  Handbook,  upon  entering  the  TDCJ,  a  prisoner  is \nassigned both a custody classification (G1-G5, and administrative segregation), and a line class \ndesignation. See www.tdcj.state.tx.us/documents/Offender_Orientation_Handbook_English.pdf, \np. 7-8.  The custody classification indicates where and with whom the inmate can live, how \nmuch supervision he will need, and what job he will be assigned to, if any, and it is determined \nby a classification committee.  Id. at 7.  The prisoner’s line class is his time-earning status, \ndesignated as L1-3 through S1-3, indicating the rate at which he can earn good time credits.  \nOffender Handbook, p. 7.  All inmates are assigned Line Class 1 (L1) when they first arrive.  Id., \np. 8.  Inmates can work their way into a higher time earning status or be placed into a lower time \nearning status, dependent upon their behavior.  Id. \n20 / 28 \n\nBoard of Pardons and Paroles on July 23, 2017 for release on discretionary mandatory \nsupervision.  Id. \n  Institutional behavior. \nSince his arrival in the TDCJ on December 17, 1997, Plaintiff has received sixteen \ndisciplinary cases, thus averaging less than one disciplinary case per year.  (D.E. 206-3, \np.  3).    Of  those  sixteen  cases,  fourteen  were  classified  as  minor  offenses,  one  was \nclassified as major/minor, and one was classified as major.   Id.  In the major case, \nDisciplinary  Case  No.  200002157,  Plaintiff  was  charged  on  March  15,  2000,  with \nfighting with another offender without a weapon, no serious injury.  (D.E. 206-7, pp. 57-\n67).  Plaintiff admitted that he got into a “misunderstanding” with the other inmate and \nbegan striking him with a closed fist about the face.  (D.E. 206-7, p. 59).  Officer \nGonzales and another inmate intervened and stopped the fight.  Id.   \nA disciplinary hearing was held on March 22, 2000.  (D.E. 206-7, p. 57).  Based \non  the  charging  officer’s  report,  Plaintiff  was  found  guilty  of  the  major  offense  of \nfighting.  Id.  As punishment, Plaintiff Davis lost 45 days recreation and commissary \nprivileges, 100 days good conduct time, and a reduction in his line classification from S-3 \nto L-1.  Id.   \nThe major/minor case was issued for refusing to obey an order on June 15, 2004 in \nDisciplinary Case No.20040293107.  (D.E. 206-7, pp. 37-38).  A hearing was held on \nJune 18, 2004, and Plaintiff admitted he was guilty.  Id. at 37.  As punishment, Plaintiff \nlost recreation and commissary privileges, and his contact visits were suspended.  Id. at \n38. \n21 / 28 \n\nSince filing this lawsuit in May 2012, Plaintiff has been charged with two minor \ndisciplinary offenses.  In Disciplinary Case No. 20150300406, Plaintiff was charged with \nbeing out of place.  (D.E. 206-6, pp. 7-8).  More specifically, he was in the restroom area \non June 19, 2015, when he had no authorization to be there.  Id.  Plaintiff pled guilty and \nas punishment received 10 days cell restriction.  Id. at 7. \nOn June 10, 2016, Plaintiff was charged with being out of place.  (D.E. 206-6, pp. \n3-4.  Plaintiff was at the 18/19 gate going to church, but he had no authorization to be \ndoing so.  Id.  As punishment, he received a verbal reprimand.  Id. \n(b)  Plaintiff Goodman. \n  Current offense and sentence length. \nPlaintiff  Goodman  is  currently  serving  two  25-year  sentences  for  aggravated \nsexual assault of a child.  (D.E. 206-2, p. 2).  His projected release date is March 21, \n2021.  Id.  His custody level is G2, and his line class is S3.  (D.E. 206-8).   \nIn the past nineteen years, from September 3, 1996 through January 31, 2016, \nPlaintiff Goodman has received twenty-two disciplinary convictions.  (D.E. 206-4, pp. 3-\n4).7  Of those cases, three were major.  Id.  In the first major case, Disciplinary Case No. \n20020266604, Plaintiff was charged with assaulting another inmate with a roll of toilet \npaper.  (D.E. 206-10, p. 54).  No serious injuries were sustained.  Id.  Plaintiff pled guilty \nand as punishment received 45 days loss of commissary and recreation, 15 days solitary \nconfinement, and a a reduction in his line class.  Id.   \n                                              \n7  There  are  actually  24  cases  listed,  but  Warden  Barber  testifies  that  there  were  only  22 \nconvictions, suggesting that two cases were dismissed. \n22 / 28 \n\nPlaintiff’s  next  major  disciplinary  case,  Disciplinary  Case  No.  20080209241, \noccurred on April 5, 2008,  after a homemade pipe containing a leafy substance that \ntested  to  be  marijuana  was  found  in  Plaintiff’s  his  cell.    (D.E.  206-10,  pp.  14-20).  \nPlaintiff was found guilty.  Id. at 14.  The remainder of the report is not legible and \ntherefore it in not known what punishment Plaintiff received. \nPlaintiff’s last major disciplinary case occurred on October 31, 2008, Disciplinary \nCase  No.  20090061530,  wherein  Plaintiff  was  charged  with  possession  of \ncontraband/child pornography.  (D.E. 206-10, pp. 7-14).  According to Plaintiff, he had \nwritten the “story” by himself and it belonged to him.  Nevertheless, he was found guilty \nand as punishment received 45 days loss of commissary and recreation and 30 days loss \nof good time credits.  Id., p. 7.   \nThe uncontested evidence shows that Davis and Goodman both have a current \ncustody classification of “G2.”  (Davis, D.E. 206-3, p. 5; Goodman, D.E. 206-4, p. 6). \nWarden Barber points out that neither Plaintiff has earned G1 status and also concludes \nas  to  each:  “He  is  not  considered  a  low-risk  offender.”    (Davis,  D.E.  206-3,  p.  5; \nGoodman, 206-4, p. 6).  Warden Barber, however, fails to offer any evidence or authority \nthat equates G2 status with not being low risk.  There are six levels in the custody \nclassification: \n1.  Administrative  segregation.    This  classification  is  for \noffenders who must be separated from the general population because they \nare dangerous, either to other offenders or staff, or they are in danger from \nother offenders.  Offenders who, according to the Security threat Group \nManagement (STGMO), are members of security threat groups designated \nby TDCJ, may be given this custody level.  These offenders leave their \ncells, for the most part, only for showers and limited recreation.   Offenders \n23 / 28 \n\nassigned to administrative segregation in expansion cellblocks shower in \ntheir cells. \n \n2.  General Population Level 5 (G5) custody refers to offenders \nwho  have  assaultive  or  aggressive  disciplinary  records.    G5  custody \noffenders must live in cells.  They may not work outside the security fence \nwithout direct, armed supervision. \n \n3.  General Population Level 4 (G4) custody means the offender \nmust live in a cell, with few exceptions, and may work outside the security \nfence under direct, armed supervision.   \n \n4.  General Population Level 3 (G3) refers to prison offenders \nwho may live in dorms or cells inside the main building of the unit.  G3 \noffenders are ineligible to live in dorms outside the main building of a unit, \ninside the security fence.  G3 offenders will generally be assigned to field \nforce and secure jobs inside the perimeter as designated by the warden.  \nThey may work outside the security fence under direct armed supervision. \n \n5.  General Population Level 2 (G2) refers to offenders who may \nlive in dorms or cells inside the security fence.  They may work outside the \nsecurity fence under direct armed supervision. \n \n6.  General Population Level 1 (G1) custody allows offenders to \nlive in dorms outside the security fence.  Offenders living in trusty camps \nwill be classified OT custody..  They may work outside the security fence \nwith periodic unarmed supervision. \n \nhttp://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/documents/Offender_Orientation_Handbook_English. \n \nPdf, p.6. \n \nThere are six custody levels, and Plaintiffs are the second lowest security risk \ngroup.  In Ali v. Stephens, the prisoner was indeed a trustee, but nowhere did the Fifth \nCircuit equate “low risk offender” with “G1”to the exclusion of other custody levels.  \nMoreover, Defendant has failed to offer any evidence to suggest that G2 inmates, by this \ndesignation alone, are not “low risk” offenders within the TDCJ-CID.     \n24 / 28 \n\nDefendant  has  argued  emphatically  that  Plaintiffs’  disciplinary  records \ndemonstrate they are risky inmates who should not be given the chance to wear long hair \nor a kouplock, and she emphasizes in particular the fact that they received cases for being \nout of place or for possession of contraband, and that these type of cases lead to a breach \nin  security.    (See  D.E.  205,  pp.  10-15).    The  problem  with  Defendant’s  argument, \nhowever, is that it is the TDCJ-CID, not Plaintiff or the courts, who designated cases for \ncontraband and being out of place as “minor.”  While in in the context of the prison \nsetting, any infraction potentially has an impact on security, and prison authorities have \ndetermined that some are major cases while some are minor. As reflected by their G2 \ncustody level, Plaintiffs here did not participate in behavior that has prevented them from \nbeing G2. \nDefendant points out that Plaintiff Goodman was in G4 custody “for about a year,” \nfollowing a major disciplinary infraction.  (D.E. 206-4, p. 6).  In 2008, Goodman did \nreceive  his  two  major  cases  for  possession  of  contraband;  however,  based  on  good \nbehavior,  he  was  returned  to  G2.    Warden  Barber  testified  that  custody  level  is \ndetermined by several factors, including an offender’s  current institutional  behavior.  \n(D.E.205, p. 17).  Plaintiff Goodman is currently G2 with no disciplinary case within the \nlast year.  (D.E. 206-4, pp. 3, 6).  This evidence could support a finding of low risk. \nThe specific exemption requested in this case by both Plaintiffs is to allow them to \nwear long hair or a kouplock.  In the district court, the TDCJ presented photographs of \nobjects small enough in size to hypothetically be hidden in a kouplock, and evidence that \ninmates at other institutions hide contraband in various styles of short and long hair, \n25 / 28 \n\nindicating that the grooming policy does further an interest in preventing the transfer of \ncontraband.  (D.E. 191, p. 18).  But the Fifth Circuit found that the TDCJ did  not \ndemonstrate on the present record that a total ban on the growing of kouplocks, even as to \nlow risk inmates such as Plaintiffs, is the least restrictive means of furthering that interest.  \nWere  Plaintiffs  caught  using  their  full  head  of  hair  or  their  kouplocks  to  smuggle \ncontraband  or  for  some  other  prohibited  purpose,  any  accommodation  could  be \nwithdrawn.  (D.E. 191, p. 18); Holt, 135 S. Ct. at 867; see also Ali v. Stephens, 2016 WL \n1741573, at *14 (“TDCJ has not shown why it is impracticable to revoke kufi privileges \nfor those inmates that resist such searches.”).  In addition, the Fifth Circuit found that a \nfact question may be presented on this point based on George Sullivan’s testimony that, \nin his experience, inmates are unlikely to hide contraband in their hair.  (D.E. 191, p. 18).  \nThis Court previously found that the TDCJ’s grooming policy provided the least \nrestrictive means of allowing Plaintiff’s to practice their Native American faith, even \nthough it did place a substantial burden on such practice.  However, after Hobbs and its \nemphasis on personal accommodation, the Court looks again at Mr. Sullivan’s testimony \nregarding security.   \nMr. Sullivan testified: \nThrough my personal experience as both a warden and as a deputy \nDirector in charge of 20 prisons, over a period of 25 years, I readily attest \nthat inmates … having long hair of personal choice length does not present \nany realistic, untoward security or prison operational problems.  Staff time \nand other costs incurred in managing such programs are routinely absorbed \nwithin the prison operation.  I have toured/audited 17 facilities of the U.S. \nbureau of prisons, all of which permit inmates to have beards and long hair, \nrequiring only that they be kept clean and well groomed.  State prison \nsystems  which  I  have  toured/audited  that  also  permit  inmates  to  wear \n26 / 28 \n\nbeards  and  long  hair,  requiring  only  that  they  be  kept  clean  and  well \ngroomed,  have  also  been  seen  by  me  to  present  to  present  no \ncorrectional/security  problem  …Presentations  made  by  TDCJ  of \npossibilities  of  inmates  carrying  contraband  in  their  long  hair  …  are \npossibilities, of course, but not probabilities; inmates have too many readily \navailable other ways to transport contraband.  I have never heard or known \nof  transporting  contraband  in  long  hair…actually  happening,  but  such \npresentations seem to be convincing to non-corrections people.  TDCJ’s \nrefusal to permit inmates to wear  long  hair … has not prevented their \ninmates from carrying contraband or fashioning homemade weapons, i.e., \n“shanks.”   \n \n(D.E.  143-1,  pp.  15-16,  Davis’  typed  submission  of  Sullivan’s  deposition \ntestimony in Odneal). \nMr. Sullivan testified that he did not believe a kouplock would be grabbed by an \ninmate  during  a  fight.    (D.E.  143-1,  p.  16,  Davis’  typed  submission  of  Sullivan’s \ndeposition testimony in Odneal).   \nOn remand, after considering Mr. Sullivan’s testimony in an identical case along \nwith the contradictory summary judgment evidence presented by Defendant, the Court \nfinds that Sullivan's testimony, as well as the contradictory evidence presented by all \nparties as to whether Plaintiffs are lower risk offenders, create factual issues that will \nrequire a trial.   \nV.  CONCLUSION. \n  The  summary  judgment  evidence  establishes  that  the  TDCJ  grooming  policy \nrequiring  short  hair  imposes  a  substantial  burden  on  Plaintiffs’  religious  exercise.  \nPlaintiffs' motion to strike (D.E. 210) and Defendant's motion to strike (D.E. 200) are \ndenied.  Moreover, Plaintiffs have established that there is a fact issue as to whether \nTDCJ's grooming policy is the least restrictive means of maintaining institutional security \n27 / 28 \n\nwithout added significant cost to TDCJ.  After revisiting this issue on remand, the court \nfinds that summary judgment in favor of Defendants on the RLUIPA grooming claim \nshould be withdrawn and denied, and recommends that the Fifth Circuit remand this case \nfor trial. \n  The Clerk shall provide a copy of this order to all parties.  The Clerk shall further \nforward a copy of this order, as well as the entire supplemental Record on Appeal, to the \nClerk for the United States Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. \n  ORDERED this 7th day of March, 2017. \n \n___________________________________ \nB.

BACKGROUND \nTeddy Norris Davis, Texas prisoner #807688, is housed in the TDCJ's \nMcConnell Unit in Beeville, Texas.  On May 21, 2012, Davis filed a prose 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983 complaint alleging that the meaningful practice of his religion \nwas being burdened by five Defendants employed by the TDCJ.  A follower of \nthe Native American religious path,  Davis challenged three TDCJ policies. \nSpecifically,  Davis alleged that TDCJ policies burdened the exercise of his \nreligious beliefs by preventing him from  (1)  smoking a  prayer pipe  during \nNative  American  pipe  ceremonies,  (2)  wearing  a  religiously  significant \n\"medicine  bag\"  other  than  within  his  cell  and  to  and  from  religious \nceremonies, and (3) growing long hair or alternatively, a kouplock, which is \"a \none inch square section of hair at the base of the skull.\"  Davis argued that \nthese  three  policies  violated  his  rights  under  RLUIPA  and  the  First \nAmendment, and that the grooming policy further violated his right to equal \nprotection, because female inmates were allowed to wear their hair long. \n2 \n\nCaCsea s2e::1 124-c-4v-00303196 6   DDooccuummeennt:t  0109511  3 F57ile9d78 o9n  07P/0ag6e/1: 63  in TDXaSteD F  i lPeda:g 0e7 3/0 o6f/ 210916 \nNo. 14-40339 \nRobbie Dow Goodman, Texas prisoner #758386,  is  also housed in the \nMcConnell  Unit  in Beeville,  Texas,  and joined this  suit,  claiming that  he \nfollows the Native American faith and has experienced the same deprivations \nas Davis.  Davis and Goodman (\"Plaintiffs\") both purport to be non-violent, \nlow security risk, or G2, custody level inmates. \nPlaintiffs  filed  an  Amended  Complaint  on  February  11,  2013,  and \nsubsequently consented to proceed before a United States Magistrate Judge. \nAt a hearing before the Magistrate Judge, Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed all \nof  their  claims  except  their  three  RLUIPA  challenges,  which  sought \ninjunctive and declaratory relief against Rick Thaler, the TDCJ Correctional \nInstitutions  Division  Director  in  his  official  capacity,  and  their  First \nAmendment claim seeking damages against Clint Morris, a  TDCJ Program \nAnalyst.  On  July  1,  2013,  after  Thaler  retired,  William  Stephens  was \nsubstituted as a Defendant. 1 \nOn July 8,  2013, Defendants filed a Motion  for Summary Judgment, \nand on July 10, 2013, Defendants filed a Supplemental Motion for Summary \nJudgment.  Plaintiffs filed  a  Cross-Motion for  Summary Judgment on July \n19, 2013. \nOn February 27, 2014, the district court issued its Opinion and Order \non Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment (\"Opinion and Order\"), and Final \nJudgment was entered in Defendants' favor.  The district court found that \nboth Plaintiffs were sincere practitioners of the Native American faith and \nthat  the  policies  complained  of constituted  a  substantial burden  on  their \nreligious  exerc1se.  The  Court  concluded,  however,  that  Defendants  had \ndemonstrated  that  the  challenged  prison  regulations  were  the  least \n1 William Stephens has retired.  On May 5,  2016, the new Director of the Texas \nDepartment  of  Criminal  Justice  Correctional  Institutions  Division,  Lorie  Davis,  was \nsubstituted as Appellee in this case. \n3 \n\nCaCseas 2e::1 124-c-4v0-0303196 6   DDooccuummeennt:t  0109511  3 5F7ile97d8 o9n  07P/a0g6e/1: 64  in TDXaSteD F  i lePda:g 0e7 4/0 o6/f2 10916 \nNo. 14-40339 \nrestrictive  means  of furthering  compelling  governmental  interests.  This \nappeal followed. \nII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \nA.  Summary Judgment Standard \n\"This  court  reviews  de  novo  a  district  court's  order  granting  a \ndefendant's motion for  summary judgment,  applying the same standard as \ndid the district court.\"  Toney v.  Owens, 779 F.3d 330, 335 (5th Cir. 2015).  A \nmovant is entitled to summary judgment \"if the movant shows that there is \nno  genuine  dispute  as  to  any material fact  and the  movant is  entitled to \njudgment as a matter of law.\"  Fed. R.  Civ. P. 56(a).  It is axiomatic that the \n\"'evidence of the nonmovant is to be  believed,  and all justifiable inferences \nare to be drawn in his favor.\"'  Tolan v.  Cotton,  134 S. Ct. 1861, 1863 (2014) \n(quoting  Anderson  v.  Liberty  Lobby,  Inc.,  4 77  U.S.  242,  255  (1986)).  A \ngenuine  dispute  of material fact  is  not created by \"conclusory allegations, \nunsubstantiated  assertions,  or  only  a  scintilla  of evidence.\"  Hathaway  v. \nBazany,  507  F.3d  312,  319  (5th  Cir.  2007)  (quotation  marks  and  citation \nomitted). \nB.  The RLUIPA \nRLUIPA provides, in relevant part, that: \nNo  government  shall  impose  a  substantial  burden  on  the \nreligious  exercise  of  a  person  residing  in  or  confined  to  an \ninstitution ... even if the burden results from a rule of general \napplicability,  unless  the  government  demonstrates  that \nimposition of the burden on that person-\n(A) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; \nand \n(B)  is  the  least  restrictive  means  of  furthering  that \ncompelling governmental interest. \n42  U.S.C.  §  2000cc-1(a).  RLUIPA  defines  \"religious  exercise\"  broadly  to \ninclude \"any exercise of religion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a \n4 \n\nCaCseas 2e::1 124-c-4v0-0303196 6   DDooccuummeennt:t  0109511  3 5F7il9e7d8 o9n  07P/a0g6e/1: 65  in TDXaSteD F  i lePda:g 0e7 5/0 o6/f2 10916 \nNo. 14-40339 \nsystem of religious belief.\"  § 2000cc-5(7)(A).  Under RLUIPA, Plaintiffs carry \nan initial burden to  show  that the challenged law,  regulation,  or practice \nsubstantially burdens the exercise of their religion.  Adkins v.  Kaspar,  393 \nF.3d 559, 567 (5th Cir. 2004).  Once Plaintiffs make this showing, Defendants \nbear  the  burden  to  prove  that  the  challenged  regulation  is  the  least \nrestrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest.  Id.; see \nalso Sossamon v.  Texas, 563 U.S. 277, 281 (2011).  Defendants' burden \"is not \nto show that it considered the claimant's proposed alternatives but rather to \ndemonstrate  those  alternatives  are  ineffective.\"  Ali  v.  Stephens,  No.  14-\n41165, 2016 WL 1741573, at *6 (5th Cir. May 2, 2016). \nCongress enacted RLUIPA to address \"frivolous or arbitrary\" barriers \nimpeding  institutionalized  persons'  religious  exercise,  but  expected  courts \nentertaining  RLUIPA  challenges  to  also  \"accord  'due  deference  to  the \nexperience  and  expertise  of  prison  and  jail  administrators.\"'  Cutter  v. \nWilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 716-17 (2005) (quoting 146 Cong. Rec. 16698, 16699 \n(2000) (joint statement of Sens. Hatch and Kennedy on RLUIPA)).  Religious \naccommodations must not override other significant interests in maintaining \norder  and  safety,  and  courts  should  give  deference  to  prison  officials  \"in \nestablishing necessary regulations  and procedures to  maintain good  order, \nsecurity  and  discipline,  consistent  with consideration  of costs  and  limited \nresources.\"  Id.  at 723.  Costs, limited resources, and prison security are all \ncompelling  state  interests.  Id.  However,  deference  is  not  unlimited  and \n\"'policies  grounded  on  mere  speculation,  exaggerated  fears,  or  post-hoc \nrationalizations  will  not  suffice  to  meet  the  act's  requirements.\"'  Rich  v. \nSec'y,  Florida Dep't of Carr.,  716 F.3d 525,  533 (11th Cir.  2013) (quoting S. \nRep.  No.  103-111,  at  10,  reprinted  in  1993  U.S.C.C.A.N.  1892,  1900) \n(discussing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, predecessor to RLUIPA); \nsee  also Holt  v.  Hobbs,  135  S.  Ct.  853,  867 (2015)  (\"Indeed,  prison policies \n5 \n\nCaCsea s2e::1 124-c-4v-00303196 6   DDooccuummeennt:t  0109511  3 F57ile9d7 8o9n  07P/0ag6e/1: 66  in TDXaSteD F  i lPeda:g 0e7 6/0 o6f/ 210916 \nNo. 14-40339 \n'grounded on mere speculation' are exactly the ones that motivated Congress \nto enact RLUIPA.\"). \nThe least-restrictive-means standard is \"exceptionally demanding, and \nrequires the government to show that it lacks other means of achieving its \ndesired goal without imposing a substantial burden on the exercise of religion \nby  the  objecting  party.\"  Holt,  135  S.  Ct.  at  864  (quotation  omitted  and \nalteration  adopted).  The  Government  must  also  demonstrate  that  the \n\"compelling interest test\" is satisfied when applying the challenged law to the \n\"particular claimant whose sincere exercise of religion is being substantially \nburdened.\"  Id. at 863 (quotation omitted).  Thus RLUIPA requires a court to \nscrutinize '\"the asserted harm of granting specific exemptions to particular \nreligious  claimants\"'  and  look  '\"to  the  marginal interest  in  enforcing'  the \nchallenged  government  action  in  that  particular  context.\"  Id.  (quoting \nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2751, 2779 (2014)). \nC.  The First Amendment \nThe  First Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution is  violated \nwhen prisoners are  not afforded \"reasonable opportunity\"  to exercise their \nreligious beliefs.  Cruz v.  Beto,  405 U.S.  319,  322 (1972)  (per curiam).  The \nFirst  Amendment  applies  to  State  prisons  by  virtue  of  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment.  Id. \nPrison officials may still place reasonable limits on the religious rights \nthat must be afforded to inmates.  In Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78 (1987), the \nSupreme  Court held that \"when a  prison regulation impinges  on inmates' \nconstitutional  rights,  the  regulation  is  valid  if it is  reasonably  related  to \nlegitimate penological interests.\"  Id.  at 89.  Courts consider four factors in \ndetermining the reasonableness of a regulation: (1)  the existence of a valid, \nrational  connection  between  the  prison  regulation  and  the  legitimate \ngovernmental  interest  put  forward  to  justify  it;  (2)  the  existence  of \n6 \n\nCaCseas 2e::1 124-c-4v0-0303196 6   DDooccuummeennt:t  0109511  3 5F7il9e7d8 o9n  07P/a0g6e/1: 67  in TDXaSteD F  i lePda: g0e7 7/0 6o/f2 10916 \nNo. 14-40339 \nalternative means of exercising the right that remain open to prison inmates; \n(3) the impact an accommodation will have on guards and other inmates, and \non  the  allocation  of  prison  resources  generally;  and  (4 )  the  absence  of \nalternatives.  Id. at 89-91. \nTurner's \"rational connection\" standard for assessing First Amendment \nclaims provides less protection against prison regulations that impinge on \ninmates'  free  exercise  of  religion  than  does  RLDIPA's  more  demanding \ncompelling-interest/least-restrictive-means standard.  Freeman v.  Texas Dep't \nof Criminal Justice, 369 F.3d 854, 858 n.1 (5th Cir. 2004). \nIII.  DISCUSSION \nPlaintiffs challenge whether summary judgment was properly granted \nin favor of the TDCJ Defendants as to their (1)  First Amendment claim, (2) \nmedicine-bag  RL DIPA    claim,  (3)  pipe-ceremony  RL DIPA    claim,  and  (4 ) \ngrooming-policy RLDIPA claim.  We find no error in the district court's grant \nof summary judgment on the first three issues, but will vacate and remand \nfor further findings as to the grooming-policy RLDIPA claim. \nA.  First Amendment Claim and Medicine-Bag RLUIPA Claim \nOn  appeal,  Davis  and  Goodman  only  briefly  mention  their  First \nAmendment claim and medicine-bag RLDIPA claim.  Issues submitted to this \nCourt  that  are  inadequately  briefed  are  considered  abandoned.  Cinel  v. \nConnick, 15 F.3d 1338, 1345 (5th Cir. 1994).  Plaintiffs' arguments as to these \ntwo  issues  are  entirely  conclusory,  and  Davis  and  Goodman  have  not \ndemonstrated that the district court erred in granting summary judgment for \nDefendants on the First Amendment claim or medicine-bag RLDIPA claim. \n1.  First Amendment Claim \nThe district court determined that Defendant Morris was entitled to \nqualified immunity because  Plaintiffs  had  not  established that their First \nAmendment  rights  to  exercise  their  religion  had  been  violated.  Since \n7 \n\nCaCseas 2e::1 124-c-4v0-0303196 6   DDooccuummeennt:t  0109511 3  5F7il9e7d8 o9n  07P/a0g6e/1: 68  in TDXaSteD F  i lePda: g0e7 8/0 6o/f2 10916 \nNo. 14-40339 \nqualified  immunity  depends  upon  whether  a  defendant  violated  a  clearly \nestablished  constitutional  right,  the  preliminary  inquiry  is  whether  the \nplaintiff can establish a violation of any constitutional right at all.  Siegert v. \nGilley,  500  U.S.  226,  232  (1991).  The  district  court  concluded  that  the \nchallenged  regulations  and  practices  were  rationally  connected  to  valid \ngovernment  interest,  and  did  not  violate  the  First Amendment.  In  this \nCourt, Davis and Goodman merely state, in a single paragraph and without \nelaboration,  that \"[t]he evidence is clear that the Appell[ants]  have indeed \nestablished  a  First  Amendment  Constitutional  violation  thereby  clearly \novercoming the Qualified Immunity Analysis [sic].\"  Plaintiffs have not raised \nany other arguments or offered further explanation as to  how  the  district \ncourt erred. \n2.  Medicine-Bag RLUIPA Claim \nThe  district  court  found  that  the  TDCJ  restrictions  on  weanng the \nmedicine  bag  were  the  least  restrictive  means  of furthering  a  compelling \ninterest  in  security  and  controlling  costs.  Before  this  Court,  Davis  and \nGoodman do not contest this conclusion, merely stating in their brief that \"it \nmay very well be that the defendants are right.\"  Plaintiffs object only to the \ndistrict court's finding that TDCJ's restrictions \"are appropriate as a  matter \nof law on this record,\" but Plaintiffs do  not clarify how the record could be \nseen as deficient.  It appears that Defendants presented evidence that the \nmedicine-bag policy furthers an interest in security and costs, and Plaintiffs \ndid  not  present  competent  summary  judgment  evidence  to  rebut  this \nassertion. \nSince Davis  and  Goodman  have  not  adequately briefed or otherwise \nidentified any legitimate points of error as to the First Amendment claim and \nmedicine-bag RLUIPA claim, summary judgment will be affirmed as to these \nISSUeS. \n8 \n\nCaCseas 2e::1 124-c-4v0-0303196 6   DDooccuummeennt:t  0109511  3 5F7ile97d8 o9n  07P/a0g6e/1: 69  in TDXaSteD F  i lePda:g 0e7 9/0 o6/f2 10916 \nNo. 14-40339 \nB.  Pipe-Ceremony RLUIPA Claim \nPlaintiffs challenge  the  TDCJ ban on inmates personally smoking a \nprayer  pipe  during  pipe  ceremonies.2  TDCJ's  official  \"Procedures  for \nReligious Programming,\" as revised in 2012,  state that  \"[o]nly the Native \nAmerican chaplain/volunteer is  authorized to  smoke the  pipe  used for  the \npipe  service.\"  Davis  and Goodman  claim  that having a  Native American \nchaplain smoke the ceremonial prayer pipe for them is insufficient, yet they \nalso do  not want to use a  communal prayer pipe due to the risk of disease. \nInstead, Plaintiffs propose that they each be allowed to purchase their own \npersonal prayer pipes from an approved vendor. 3 \nPlaintiffs'  suggestion  that  inmates  be  allowed  to  possess  personal \nprayer pipes has already been considered and rejected by this Court.  Chance \nv.  Texas Dep't of Criminal Justice,  730 F.3d 404, 412-13 (5th Cir. 2013).  In \n2011,  a  TDCJ  Native  American  prisoner,  William  Chance,  requested \npermission to possess a  personal pipe because he suffered from hepatitis C \nand tuberculosis and wished to avoid smoking from the communal pipe used \nin pipe ceremonies.  See  Chance  v.  TDCJ,  Case No.  6:11-cv-435  (E.D.  Tex. \nJune 16, 2011) (Compl.).  The Chance litigation prompted TDCJ officials to \nre-examine  the policy concerning pipe  ceremonies in light of these  serious \nhealth  concerns.  After  conducting  a  study,  TDCJ  concluded  that  going \nforward  only the  Native American chaplain performing the pipe  ceremony \n2 In the district court, Davis and Goodman also challenged the frequency of Native \nAmerican ceremonies under RLUIPA.  The Magistrate Judge concluded that the TDCJ \nvolunteer  chaplain  policy  was  the  least  restrictive  means  of  furthering  Defendants' \ncompelling interest in prison administration.  This issue has not been raised on appeal. \ns  Davis and Goodman also claim that TDCJ never considered the use of the herb \n\"cansasa\" in the pipe ceremony as a least restrictive means.  Because the TDCJ policy does \nnot allow inmates to smoke their own personal prayer pipe for other reasons such as health, \ncost,  and  security  concerns,  the  substance  being  smoked  is  irrelevant to  the  RLUIPA \nanalysis in this case and consideration of tobacco alternatives is unnecessary. \n9 \n\nCaCseas 2e::1 124-c-4v0-0303196 6   DDooccuummeennt:t  0109511 3  5F7il9e7d8 o9n  07P/a0g6e/1: 61 0in  TXDSatDe   F Pileadg: e0 17/00 6o/f2 10916 \nNo. 14-40339 \ncould smoke the prayer pipe during Native American pipe ceremonies.  The \nTDCJ Chaplaincy Manual was revised in July 2012 to reflect this change. \nThe district court in Chance granted summary judgment for TDCJ on \nthe  pipe-ceremony  issue.  This  Court  affirmed  and  held  that  TDCJ  had \ncarried its burden of demonstrating that the policy banning communal and \nindividual pipes and allowing only the ceremony leader to smoke the pipe at \nceremonies  was  the  least  restrictive  means  of  furthering  compelling \ngovernment interests in \"prison health,  administration,  and security,\" and, \naccordingly, did not violate RLUIPA.  Chance, 730 F.3d at 407-08. \nIn  Chance,  this  Court  considered  the  option  of  permitting  every \nprisoner to purchase and smoke his own pipe, and Davis and Goodman do not \npresent any  new  or different arguments from  those  previously considered. \nSee  id.  at 413.  In this case,  both TDCJ and the district court considered \nallowing  inmate-owned  pipes  to  be  stored  in  the  chaplain's  office,  but \nlogistical, health, and security concerns outweighed the need for a  religious \naccommodation.  As  to  this  issue,  the  district  court's  grant  of  summary \njudgment will be affirmed. \nC.  Grooming-Policy RLUIPA Claim \nWe  will,  however,  vacate  the  grant  of  summary  judgment  on  the \ngrooming-policy RLUIPA claim for two reasons.  First, the record does not \nreflect whether appropriate consideration was given to Plaintiffs' summary \njudgment evidence.  Second,  there is a  need for further findings  under the \nstandard for evaluating RLUIPA claims as discussed in Holt v.  Hobbs, 135 S. \nCt. 853, 864 (2015), because Plaintiffs' RLUIPA claims must be evaluated on \nremand in light of the security risk presented by Plaintiffs as individuals. \n1.  Plaintiffs' Summary Judgment Evidence \nPlaintiffs  contend  that  the  district  court  did  not  g1ve  proper \nconsideration to  their summary judgment evidence  on the  grooming-policy \n10 \n\nCaCseas 2e::1 124-c-4v0-0303196  6   DDooccuummeentn: t 0109511 3  5F7il9e7d8 o9n  07P/a0g6e/1: 61 1in  TXDSatDe   F Pileadg: e0 71/10 6o/f2 10916 \nNo. 14-40339 \nRLUIPA  claim.  A  nonmovant's  evidence  on  summary judgment \"is  to  be \nbelieved, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.\"  Cotton, \n134 S.  Ct.  at  1863.  Plaintiffs  attempted to  present evidence  at summary \njudgment by retyping or referencing portions of a  TDCJ official's testimony \nand the expert testimony of George Sullivan 4  from an earlier bench trial in \nanother Native American inmate's lawsuit challenging the TDCJ grooming \npolicy.  Within their reply brief on summary judgment, Defendants moved to \nstrike this evidence.  However, the district court did not rule on their request. \nBecause the motion to strike was included in Defendants' reply brief \nand not docketed as a separate motion, it is unclear whether the district court \noverlooked the motion or decided not to rule on it on grounds that it was not \nproperly asserted.  In any event, Sullivan's expert testimony was before the \ndistrict court when it granted summary judgment, but the district court made \nno mention of it. \nSullivan's testimony was taken from an earlier bench trial in Odneal v. \nDretke, 2:4cv454 (S.D. Tex. filed Aug. 30, 2004), and may be relevant in this \ncase,  because  Odneal involved claims  similar to  those  presented here.  In \nOdneal,  Shawn Odneal, a  male inmate also housed in the McConnell Unit, \nchallenged  the  insufficient  frequency  of pipe  ceremonies  and other Native \nAmerican religious ceremonies.  See Odneal v.  Dretke,  435 F.  Supp. 2d 608, \n610-11 (S.D. Tex. 2006) (\"Odneal!').  Odneal claimed to have learned about \nthe spiritual path of the Native American people from one of the Plaintiffs in \nthis case, Teddy Davis.  See Odneal v.  Pierce,  C.A.  No.  C-04-454,  2010 WL \n3359535,  at *2  (S.D.  Tex.  Aug.  20,  2010)  (\"Odneal  If').  Both Davis  and \nGeorge  Sullivan is  an experienced prison official who  has worked with Native \n4 \nAmerican populations in prisons in Oregon and Colorado. \n11 \n\nCaCsea s2e::1 124-c-4v0-0303196 6   DDooccuummeennt:t  0109511  3 F57ile9d78 o9n  07P/a0g6e/1: 61 2in  TXDSaDte   F Pileadg:e 0 172/0 o6f/2 10916 \nNo. 14-40339 \nGoodman attempted to join Odneal's case in 2004,  but their requests were \ndenied. \nOdneal also challenged the TDCJ policy on wearing of medicine bags, \nand sought permission to grow long hair or wear a kouplock.  Odneal I, 435 F. \nSupp. 2d at 611 (challenging essentially the same policies as those at issue in \nthis  litigation).  The  district  court  dismissed  Odneal's  claims  regarding \nwearing a medicine bag and growing long hair,  reasoning that TDCJ policy \non medicine bags was rationally connected to security interests pursuant to \nTurner, 482 U.S. at 89-91, and the long-hair claim was foreclosed by Diaz v. \nCollins,  114  F.3d 69,  73  (5th  Cir.  1997).  The  district  court  also  granted \nsummary judgment against Odneal on his claim concerning the insufficient \nfrequency of religious ceremonies.  Odneal I, 435 F. Supp. 2d at 622. \nIn an unpublished per curiam opinion, this Court affirmed the grant of \nsummary  judgment  as  to  the  pipe-ceremony  claims,  but  remanded  the \nmedicine-bag  and  long-hair  issues  to  the  district  court  for  further \ndevelopment of the evidentiary record.  Odneal  v.  Pierce,  324 F. App'x 297, \n302 (5th Cir. 2009) (\"Odneal appeal\").  As to the medicine-bag RLUIPA claim, \nthis  Court held that the  district court had applied the wrong standard in \nanalyzing  the  medicine-bag  claim  by  utilizing  the  rational-connection/ \nlegitimate-government-interest test rather than RLUIPA's more demanding \ncompelling-interest/least-restrictive-means test.  As to the grooming-policy \nRLUIPA claim, this Court reasoned that cases, such as Diaz, involving long \nhair  generally  do  not  necessarily  foreclose  a  prisoner's  claims  involving \nkouplocks,  which  may have unexplored distinctions in the area of security \nrisks.  Id. at 301 (distinguishing Diaz, 114 F.3d at 72). \nOn  remand,  Odneal  was  appointed  counsel  and  abandoned  his \nmedicine-bag claim, proceeding to trial only on the long-hair/kouplock issue. \nOdneal II,  2010 WL 3359535, at *2.

Odneal countered  this \nevidence  with  the  testimony  and  expert  report  of  George  Sullivan,  an \nexperienced  prison  official  who  has  worked  with  Native  American \npopulations in prisons in Oregon and Colorado.  Id.  Sullivan testified that \nkouplocks  do  not  present  security  issues  and  are  not  practical places  for \nhiding contraband.  Id.  at *7.  Based on Sullivan's testimony,  the  district \ncourt denied summary judgment, finding that there were genuine issues of \nmaterial fact  as  to  whether the policy prohibiting Odneal from  wearing a \nkouplock served a compelling interest, and was the least restrictive means of \nachieving that interest.  Id. at *8. \nOdneal's  kouplock  claim  proceeded to  a  two-day  bench trial held  on \nDecember 13-14,  2010.  See  Odneal v.  Pierce,  C.A.  No.  C-04-454,  2011 WL \n2678940,  at *1  (S.D.  Tex.  July 7,  2011)  (\"Odneal Ill').  Before  the  district \ncourt could issue a  ruling, TDCJ transferred Odneal to a  Minnesota prison \nwhere he would be permitted to grow his hair.  Id. at *2.  Thus, the kouplock \nissue became moot and remained undecided. \nHere,  Plaintiffs purported to present summary judgment evidence  to \nrebut  prison  officials'  testimony  by  retyping  and  citing  George  Sullivan's \nexpert testimony from  Odneal's bench trial.  The district court's opinion on \nsummary judgment does not reflect what consideration, if any, was given to \nPlaintiffs' summary judgment evidence. 5  The district court briefly discussed \nthe  Odneal appeal in a  footnote  and concluded that \"the  Odneal case has \n5  Davis and Goodman also contend that the district court failed to consider their \npost-judgment Reply to Defendants' Reply to the Motion for Summary Judgment.  However, \nin denying Plaintiffs' Rule  59(e)  Motion for  Reconsideration of the  Court's Opinion and \nOrder, the Magistrate Judge indicated that she took into account the post-judgment Reply \nand found no basis for overturning summary judgment. \n13 \n\nCaCseas 2e::1 124-c-4v0-0303196 6   DDooccuummeennt:t  0109511  3 5F7il9e7d8 o9n  07P/a0g6e/1: 61 4in  TXDSatDe   F Pileadg: e0 174/0 6o/f2 10916 \nNo. 14-40339 \nlittle or no bearing on the case sub judice.\"  Despite the district court's finding \nin  Odneal  II  that  Sullivan's  expert  testimony  created  genuine  issues  of \nmaterial fact  on the kouplock claim,  2010 WL  3359535,  at *8,  the district \ncourt's analysis of Plaintiffs' kouplock claims in this case was limited to one \nparagraph  and  did  not  discuss  Sullivan's  testimony,  which  had  not  been \nstricken.  Instead,  the  district  court  stated  that  Defendants'  summary \njudgment evidence was \"uncontroverted.\" \nGiven  the  posture  of the  case  at  summary  judgment,  Defendants' \nevidence  regarding  the  kouplock  issue  was  not  plainly  uncontroverted. \nPlaintiffs  had  typed  verbatim,  and  referenced  portions  of,  testimony  by \nwitnesses from  Odneal's bench trial to support their grooming-policy claim. \nPlaintiffs  also  informed  the  Magistrate  Judge  of their  desire  to  use  this \ntestimony during an evidentiary hearing held  on June  21,  2012.  At that \nhearing,  the  Magistrate  Judge  indicated  that  the  law  might  permit  this \nevidence  to  be  used  against  TDCJ,  but  that  its  admissibility  would  be \ndetermined  at  a  future  time.  It appears  from  the  record  that  such  a \ndetermination was never made. \nAs an additional reason that we cannot conclude the evidence was not \nbefore  the  district  court,  the  record  indicates  that  Plaintiffs,  as  pro  se \nprisoner litigants, were permitted some leeway in the form of documents that \ncould  be  submitted.  In another order entered on December 20,  2013,  the \ndistrict  court  responded  to  Plaintiffs'  request  for  copies  of pleadings  by \nstating that Plaintiffs  could \"hand copy  all documents  sent to  the  Clerk.\" \nThat  order  specifically  dealt  with  maintaining  Plaintiffs'  own  files  of \ndocuments  sent  to  the  district  court,  but  could  reasonably  have  been \nconstrued  by  Plaintiffs  as  an  invitation  to  make  hand-written  facsimiles \nwhen necessary for filing with the district court.  Among the grounds argued \nin Defendants' motion to strike Sullivan's testimony was Plaintiffs' failure to \n14 \n\nCaCsea s2e::1 124-c-4v-00303196 6   DDooccuummeennt:t  0109511  3 F57ile9d78 o9n  07P/0ag6e/1: 61 5in  TXDSaDte   F Pileadg:e 0 175/0 o6f/ 210916 \nNo. 14-40339 \nattach the relevant portions of the actual transcript from  which the typed \ncopy  was  made.  However,  in  light  of  the  December  20,  2013,  order \nreferencing the  hand-copying of materials,  it is  not  clear that the  district \ncourt would have discounted Plaintiffs' summary judgment evidence merely \nfor reasons of form. \nIn  substance,  it  is  also  unclear  why  Plaintiffs'  summary  judgment \nevidence would not be relevant to the district court's decision.  In Odneal's \ncase,  summary judgment was denied and the  district court found  genuine \nissues  of material  fact  remained  on  facts  and  evidence  similar  to  those \npresented by Plaintiffs in this  case.  Odneal II,  2010  WL  3359535,  at *8. \nWhile RLUIPA \"suggests a  fact-specific inquiry that takes into account the \nspecial circumstances of the individual prisoner and prison,\" see Chance,  730 \nF.3d at 410,  this case and Odneal involved the same unit within the same \nprison and prisoners with substantially similar characteristics raising similar \nchallenges  to  the  TDCJ  grooming policy.  As  such,  evidence  developed  in \nOdneal's  case  could  be  relevant  in  the  present  suit,  even  under  the \nindividualized inquiry standard. \nIf Plaintiffs' expert testimony evidence  was  not credited because the \nMagistrate  Judge  found  it  inadmissible  or  improper,  the  record  does  not \nreflect this determination.  Were the district court to have made a considered \ndecision that evidence from  Odneal's bench trial was not relevant or should \nbe stricken from the record, or otherwise discussed the evidence presented in \na  meaningful way,  the  decision  to  grant summary judgment on  this issue \nmight ultimately have been supported.  However, the current record does not \nreflect  whether  the  Magistrate  Judge  considered  Plaintiffs'  evidence  and \ndrew reasonable inferences in their favor, as is required in deciding a motion \nfor  summary judgment.  Cotton,  134  S.  Ct.  at  1863.  Remand for  further \nconsideration of this issue is warranted. \n15 \n\nCaCsea s2e::1 124-c-4v0-0303196 6   DDooccuummeennt:t  0109511  3 F57ile9d78 o9n  07P/a0g6e/1: 61 6in  TXDSaDte   F Pileadg:e 0 176/0 o6f/ 210916 \nNo. 14-40339 \n2.  Holt v. Hobbs and Plaintiffs' Particular Characteristics \nThe grooming-policy RLUIPA claim should also be remanded because \nthe  district court did  not  appear to  consider Plaintiffs'  specific,  individual \nstatus  as  low  custody  level  inmates  in  relation  to  their  theory  that  the \ngroom1ng  restrictions  are  unnecessary  as  applied  to  them.  Davis  and \nGoodman  argue  that  the  district  court's  op1n10n  does  not  reflect  that \nconsideration  was  given  to  their  specific  security  risk  status,  which  they \nassert was low, in determining whether disallowing a kouplock substantially \nburdened their religious exercise by the least restrictive means. 6 \nThe  Supreme  Court  has  explained  that  RLUIPA  \"requires  the \nGovernment  to  demonstrate  that  the  compelling  interest  test  is  satisfied \nthrough  application  of the  challenged  law  to  the  person-the  particular \nclaimant whose sincere exercise of religion is being substantially burdened.\" \nHolt,  135 S. Ct. at 863 (quoting Hobby Lobby, 134 S.  Ct. at 2779) (quotation \nmarks omitted). \nIn Holt,  135 S.  Ct. at 853, the Supreme Court considered a  RLUIPA \nchallenge to the Arkansas Department of Corrections' no-beard policy.  The \npolicy  prohibited  inmates  from  wearing  facial  hair  other  than  a  \"neatly \ntrimmed mustache.\"  !d. at 860.  The policy made no religious exceptions, but \ndid allow inmates with diagnosed dermatological conditions to wear a  J;t -inch \nbeard.  !d.  In  accordance  with  his  Muslim  faith,  Gregory  Holt  sought \npermission  to  grow  a  Y2-inch  beard.  !d.  at 859,  861.  Holt's  request was \ndenied, and he filed suit under RLUIPA.  !d. at 861. Following an evidentiary \n6 On appeal, Davis and Goodman also claim that the district court erred in failing to \nconsider the option to house all low security risk Native American inmates in one unit and \nallow long hair or a kouplock only on that unit.  It does not appear that this argument was \nraised in the district court.  This Court does not \"consider arguments or evidence that was \nnot presented to the district court.\"  Benefit Recovery, Inc.  v.  Donelan, 521 F.3d 326, 329 \n(5th Cir. 2008). \n16 \n\nCaCsea s2e::1 214-c-v4-00303196 6   DDooccuummeennt:t  0109511  3 F5i7le9d7 8o9n  07P/0a6ge/1: 61 7in  TXDSaDte   F Pileadg:e 0 177/0 o6f/ 210916 \nNo. 14-40339 \nhearing, the district court dismissed Holt's RLUIPA complaint for failure to \nstate  a  claim,  and the  Eighth  Circuit  affirmed.  Id.  The  Supreme  Court \nreversed, holding that the Department's grooming policy violated RLUIPA as \napplied to Holt.  Id. at 867. \nThe Court reasoned that the Department's stated justification for the \npolicy,  preventing  the  flow  of  contraband,  would  not  be  seriously \ncompromised  by  permitting  Holt  to  grow  a  Yz-inch  beard.  Id.  at  863. \nSimilarly,  the  Court  found  the  Department's  interests  in  prisoner \nidentification and security would not be severely compromised.  Id. at 865.  In \nreaching  this  conclusion,  the  Court  noted  that  permitting  a  religious \naccommodation  to  a  grooming  policy  may  still  allow  prison  officials  to \nmaintain  security because  RLUIPA  allows  an institution \"to  withdraw an \naccommodation  if the  claimant  abuses  the  exemption  in  a  manner  that \nundermines the prison's compelling interests.\"  Id. at 867. \nApplying Holt, another panel of this Court recently affirmed a  district \ncourt's  grant of declaratory and injunctive relief enabling a  Muslim TDCJ \ninmate  to  grow  a  four-inch  beard  and  wear  his  kufi  throughout  TDCJ's \nfacilities.  Ali, 2016 WL 1741573, at *1.  In doing so, this Court reviewed the \n7 \ndistrict court's findings  as to the TDCJ grooming policy and evaluated the \nevidence  supporting  TDCJ's  concerns  over  preventing  the  transfer  of \ncontraband, facilitating inmate identification, controlling costs, and ensuring \norderly program administration, all of which have been raised as interests in \nthis litigation.  Id. at *6-13.  Examining the specific exemption requested, a \nfour-inch beard, this Court found that TDCJ's ban on the wearing of such a \nGeorge Sullivan also testified as an expert witness in the Ali bench trial that self \n7 \nsearches  and  visual  inspections  of longer  beards  are  effective  methods  for  revealing \ncontraband. Ali, 2016 WL 1741573, at *8. \n17 \n\nCaCseas 2e::1 124-c-4v0-0303196 6   DDooccuummeennt:t  0109511  3 F57ile9d78 o9n  07P/a0g6e/1: 61 8in  TXDSaDte   F Pileadg:e 0 178/0 o6f/2 10916 \nNo. 14-40339 \nbeard  as  to  Ali  was  not  the  least  restrictive  means  of furthering  these \ninterests. \nB \nIn  light  of  Holt,  TDCJ's  asserted  compelling  interests  must  be \nexamined in light of the particular characteristics of each Plaintiff, including \ntheir alleged low security risk status and the particular risks of the specific \nexemption requested.  135 8. Ct.  at 863.  The specific exemption requested \nhere is to allow  Plaintiffs to wear long hair or a  kouplock.  In the district \ncourt,  TDCJ  presented  photographs  of  objects  small  enough  in  size  to \nhypothetically be hidden in a kouplock,  and evidence that inmates at other \ninstitutions  hide  contraband  in  various  styles  of  short  and  long  hair, \nindicating that the grooming policy does further an interest in preventing the \ntransfer of contraband.  But TDCJ  has  not  demonstrated  on  the  present \nrecord that a total ban on the growing of kouplocks, even as to low security \nrisk inmates such as Plaintiffs, is the least restrictive means of furthering \nthat interest.  Were Plaintiffs to be caught using their kouplocks to smuggle \ncontraband or for some other prohibited purpose, any accommodation could \nbe withdrawn.  Id. at 867; see also Ali, 2016 WL 1741573, at *14 (\"TDCJ has \nnot shown why it is impracticable to revoke kufi privileges for those inmates \nthat resist such searches.\").  In addition, a fact question may be presented on \nthis  point  based  on  George  Sullivan's  testimony  that,  in  his  experience, \ninmates are unlikely to hide contraband in their hair. \nBecause  TDCJ's  interests in preventing the  wearing of long  hair or \nkouplocks were not evaluated in light of the specific characteristics of each \nPlaintiff as purportedly low security risk Native American inmates, remand \nfor further findings on this issue is appropriate. \n8 The Court began its analysis by noting that Ali \"is a 'trusty' inmate, which is the \nlowest security level classification, and lives in a dormitory outside of the Michael Unit's \nfence line.\"  Id. \n18 \n\nCaCsaes e2:: 1124--c4v0-303091 66  D Dooccuummenetn: t0 109511 3  5F7il9e7d8 o9n   07P/a0g6e/:1 619 i n TDXaStDe  F  iPleadg: e0 71/90 6o/f2 10916 \nNo. 14-40339 \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nThe  district  court  did  not  err  in  granting  summary  judgment  on \nPlaintiffs' First Amendment claim,  medicine-bag RLUIPA claim,  and pipe \nceremony RLUIPA claim.  Because the district court did not strike Plaintiffs' \nsummary judgment evidence, including George  Sullivan's expert testimony, \nand because genuine issues of material fact remain regarding the legitimacy \nof TDCJ's cost and security concerns created by the wearing of a kouplock by \nPlaintiffs as low security risk Native American inmates, and further because \nthe district court did not consider Plaintiffs' grooming-policy claim in light of \nPlaintiffs' individual circumstances, we VACATE and REMAND in part for \nfurther  proceedings  as to  Plaintiffs'  grooming-policy  claim  under RLUIPA. \nWe AFFIRM the judgment of the district court in all other respects. \n19 ",
