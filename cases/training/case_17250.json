    "summary": "<p>This case challenges the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) 2019 policy memorandum that instructed asylum officers to reassess whether applicants previously determined to be unaccompanied alien children (UACs) still met that definition at the time of application and, if not, to decline jurisdiction.</p>\r\n<p>On July 1, 2019, four unaccompanied children seeking asylum in the United States filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The plaintiffs sued the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs alleged that the policy retroactively stripped them of protections under the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) and created a filing deadline that did not exist at the time they submitted their claims, in violation of the APA and the Fifth Amendment. Represented by Goodwin Procter LLP, Kids in Need of Defense, the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, and Public Counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief. On the day of filing, plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order. On August 2, 2019, the court, Judge George J. Hazel, granted the TRO, which was later converted to a preliminary injunction. 409 F.Supp.3d 367.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Subsequently, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as a defendant. The court denied the government&rsquo;s motion to dismiss the amended complaint. 2020 WL 2932922.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On December 21, 2020, the court certified a class of individuals who had been designated UACs and filed asylum applications prior to the effective date of any lawful new policy, but whose applications remained pending. 228 F.R.D. 33. The court also granted plaintiffs&rsquo; motion to amend the preliminary injunction. The order enjoined USCIS from applying the 2019 policy to decline jurisdiction over class members&rsquo; asylum applications, barred the agency from deferring to EOIR determinations, and restricted ICE from seeking control of class members&rsquo; asylum claims during removal proceedings.</p>\r\n<p>The parties proceeded through further discovery and motion practice, including filing an amended complaint. The government appealed the class certification order to the Fourth Circuit (No. 21-1187), but voluntarily dismissed that appeal in November 2024 following settlement. 2024 Wl 5515354.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;In January 2022, the parties requested referral to mediation, which ultimately resulted in a joint motion for class-wide settlement approval filed in July 2024. On November 29, 2024, the court approved the settlement, dissolved the preliminary injunction, and entered final judgment. Under the agreement, USCIS rescinded the 2019 Redetermination Memo, reaffirmed initial jurisdiction over covered UAC asylum applications, and agreed not to execute removal orders until those applications were adjudicated. On December 23, 2024, plaintiffs moved for attorneys&rsquo; fees. (These were eventually granted, in July 2025. 2025 WL 1940353. The court found over $900,000 fees justified because the government&rsquo;s implementation of the 2019 policy failed to provide the required notice and comment period, and because it was inappropriately applied retroactively. On September 16, 2025, the government appealed this order.)&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Trump Administration Violates Settlement Agreement&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Following the start of a new administration in April 2025, the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion to enforce the settlement. They alleged that ICE had removed a class member on March 15, 2025, under a presidential proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act (AEA). The class member, Cristian (a pseudonym), is a Venezuelan youth with a pending USCIS asylum application. On April 23, the court, now Judge Stephanie A. Gallagher, granted the enforcement motion. 779 F.Supp.3d 570. The court found that Cristian fell within the class definition and that the government&rsquo;s removal of him prior to asylum adjudication violated Section III.I of the agreement. The court ordered ICE to &ldquo;facilitate&rdquo; Cristian&rsquo;s return and enjoined the removal of any class members with pending asylum applications.</p>\r\n<p>On May 4, 2025, the government moved to vacate the enforcement order, arguing that Cristian&rsquo;s asylum claim was barred due to his designation as a member of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua (TdA) and his prior felony conviction. USCIS had issued an &ldquo;Indicative Asylum Decision&rdquo; concluding that Cristian&rsquo;s application would be denied. The court denied the motion to vacate but stayed the return order for two days to allow for appeal.</p>\r\n<p>On May 8, the Fourth Circuit (No. 25-1519) granted an administrative stay of the return provision through May 15. On May 19, the court denied a broader stay in a split decision. Judge Benjamin, joined by Judge Gregory, upheld the district court&rsquo;s enforcement order. 2025 WL 1431263. Judge Gregory also issued a concurrence suggesting that the underlying AEA proclamation was &ldquo;plainly invalid.&rdquo; Judge Richardson dissented, arguing that AEA removals fell outside the scope of the settlement and that &ldquo;court-commanded negotiation with a foreign state&rdquo; exceeded judicial authority.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The government will also sought an abeyance of appellate proceedings pending an indicative ruling from the district court. Though the government maintained that the court order was unlawful, because it has complied with the order, the injunction should be dissolved making the case moot. (The Fourth Circuit granted this motion on October 9, 2025.).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Back in the district court, the court ordered the government to file sworn status reports on steps taken to return Cristian. Because the government&rsquo;s filings were vague and unresponsive, the court ordered expedited discovery. On June 5, 2025, the court directed the government to answer interrogatories, produce documents, and submit to two depositions. The court also required weekly sworn updates from knowledgeable officials.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The following month, the court issued a letter order noting that a UN human rights report&mdash;cited in parallel litigation in <em>J.G.G. v. Trump</em>&mdash;contained statements from the Salvadoran government disclaiming custody responsibility for deported Venezuelans, suggesting that the U.S. retained control. The court directed the government to explain why diplomatic negotiations were necessary to comply with the return order.</p>\r\n<p>On August 14, 2025, the plaintiffs asked the court to find probable cause to hold defendants in contempt for intentionally violating the court ordered Settlement Agreement. Plaintiffs alleged that the government had failed to adequately update the court on Cristian&rsquo;s whereabouts and had arranged for his release to Venezuela rather than return to the U.S.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The government filed its response on September 11, 2025. The government claimed that they could not simply request that El Salvador return Cristian to U.S. custody because he was under their sovereign authority and this was a matter of complex diplomatic relations traditionally carried out by the Secretary of State. Thus, the fact that the government facilitated talks between El Salvador and the Maduro Regime of Venezuela, with the agreement that the individual would be able to come back to the U.S. is sufficient to comply with the court's order. Additionally, the government claimed that it was not able to fully disclose information within status reports because of state secrets privileges.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On October 2, 2025, the plaintiffs notified the court that the government had removed six &ldquo;potential&rdquo; J.O.P. class members in violation of the settlement agreement. Three individuals were removed three months ago, but the government has not specified when the other removals occurred. The plaintiffs requested additional information from the government about these six individuals. Once they have that information, the plaintiffs expect that they will file motions seeking expedited relief.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs also filed a reply to the government's claims regarding the contempt motion. The plaintiffs contend that the court order was clearly and narrowly required the government to make a <em>request </em>to the El Salvador government to facilitate the release of Cristian to U.S. custody. Based on the record available and the government's omissions, plaintiffs claim that request was not made. Additionally, the plaintiffs take issue with the fact that government's failure to file timely status reports were a strategic choice to conceal real time events during the prisoner exchange. Especially given that the government conceded that it was partly out of fear of public scrutiny affecting the deal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As of October 2025, the government maintains that it will facilitate Cristian&rsquo;s return from Venezuela when he wishes to return. But the government has declined to confirm that it will not detain or remove him to a third country without due process if he chooses to return. The preliminary injunction remains in effect and discovery on enforcement is ongoing. Also, the attorneys fee appeal in the Fourth Circuit remains pending.&nbsp;</p>",

This Court \ngranted final approval of the parties’ Settlement Agreement in November, 2024 and retained \njurisdiction to enforce its provisions. ECF 205. Defendants have now removed at least one Class \nMember from this country without adjudication of his asylum petition on the merits by USCIS. \nAs a result, at this stage of the proceedings, both parties agree that this is just a breach of contract \n \n1 Defendants are the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services (“USCIS”), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”), and \nseveral officials of these agencies (collectively “Defendants” or “government Defendants”). \n \n1 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 253     Filed 04/23/25     Page 2 of 19\ncase. It is not a habeas case, or a case assessing the propriety of the government’s recent \ninvocation of the Alien Enemies Act (“AEA”). \nCurrently pending are three motions: Class Counsel’s emergency motion to enforce the \nSettlement Agreement, ECF 227, and two motions to proceed by pseudonym, ECF 231, 236. \nDefendants have opposed the motions, ECF 248, 249, and Class Counsel filed a reply in support \nof their motion to enforce, ECF 250. This Court held a motions hearing on April 22, 2025. For \nthe reasons set forth below, this Court will enforce the terms of the parties’ binding Settlement \nAgreement and will grant the two motions to proceed by pseudonym. \nI.  Background \nPursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 551 et seq. (“APA”) and the \nDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, a group of \nundocumented  immigrants  who  entered  the  United  States  as  unaccompanied  children \n(“Plaintiffs”) brought this action for declaratory and injunctive relief on July 1, 2019. The \nComplaint alleged that Defendants unlawfully modified policies governing treatment of an \nasylum application by an unaccompanied alien child (“UAC”)2 in a May 31, 2019 USCIS \nMemorandum (“2019 Redetermination Memo”).3 ECF 1. The Complaint included four named \nPlaintiffs, each of whom submitted personal declarations describing their departures from their \ncountries of birth and their arrivals in the United States, ECF 16, 18, 19, 20. The named Plaintiffs \n \n2 An “unaccompanied alien child” or “UAC” means “‘a child who—(A) has no lawful \nimmigration status in the United States; (B) has not attained 18 years of age; and (C) with respect \nto whom—(i) there is no parent or legal guardian in the United States; or (ii) no parent or legal \nguardian in the United States is available to provide care and physical custody,’ as set forth in 6 \nU.S.C. § 279(g)(2).” ECF 199-2 at 6, Section II.U. \n \n3 The Court incorporates herein the extensive discussion of the statutory and regulatory \nbackground in this matter from its prior opinion, ECF 54 at 2-7. \n \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 253     Filed 04/23/25     Page 3 of 19\nmoved to proceed under pseudonyms in this litigation, ECF 12, and the Court approved that \nprocedure, ECF 55. \nIn 2024, the parties reached a final Settlement Agreement providing relief to a certified \nclass of young asylum seekers previously determined to be UACs, ECF 199-2, and the Court \ngranted final approval of the Settlement Agreement on November 25, 2024, ECF 205. The \nSettlement Agreement defines the certified Class as “all individuals nationwide who prior to \n[February 24, 20254]: (1) were determined to be a UAC; and (2) who filed an asylum application \nthat was pending with USCIS; and (3) on the date they filed their asylum application with USCIS, \nwere 18 years of age or older, or had a parent or legal guardian in the United States who is \navailable to provide care and physical custody; and (4) for whom USCIS has not adjudicated the \nindividual’s asylum application on the merits.” ECF 199-2 at 5, Section II.E. \nSection III.B is among the Settlement Agreement’s core protections for Class Members \nwhich are relevant to the motion at issue. Section III.B provides that “USCIS will exercise Initial \nJurisdiction over Class Members’ asylum applications in accordance with the terms of this \nSettlement Agreement and adjudicate them on the merits.” Id. at 7. Other provisions of the \nSettlement Agreement require USCIS’s exercise of initial jurisdiction over Class Member \nasylum applications. See ECF 199-2 at 9, Section III.H (“With respect to DHS’s treatment of \nClass Members in removal proceedings, DHS will refrain from taking the position that USCIS \n \n4 Section III.A provides that USCIS has “fully rescinded the 2019 Redetermination Memo” and \nwill issue “a superseding memorandum explaining and implementing this Settlement \nAgreement” which “will remain in effect for at least three years” from its effective date. ECF \n199-2 at 7. “The superseding memorandum’s effective date will be 90 days after the Court’s final \napproval of this Settlement Agreement,” which is February 24, 2025. Id. The Defendants filed a \nCompliance Report stating that USCIS had issued a superseding memorandum in accordance \nwith Section III.A of the Settlement Agreement. ECF 217 ¶ A.  \n \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 253     Filed 04/23/25     Page 4 of 19\ndoes not have Initial Jurisdiction over a Class Member’s asylum application.”).  \nParticularly relevant to Class Counsel’s motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement are \nSection III.I, which states that “[w]ith respect to any Class Member with a final removal order, \nICE will refrain from executing the Class Member’s final removal order until USCIS issues a \nFinal Determination on one properly filed asylum application under the terms of this Agreement,” \nand Section V.D., which provides that “the complaining Class Member shall not be removed \nfrom the United States” once a motion to enforce has been filed “unless and until the matter has \nbeen resolved in favor of Defendants.” ECF No. 199-2 at 9, 14. \nOn March 14, 2025, President Trump signed a Proclamation titled Invocation of the Alien \nEnemies  Act  Regarding  the  Invasion  of  the  United  States  by  Tren  de  Aragua  (“AEA \nProclamation”). ECF 227-2 at 37. Section 1 of the Proclamation directed that “all Venezuelan \ncitizens 14 years of age or older who are members of [Tren de Aragua (“TdA”)], are within the \nUnited States, and are not actually naturalized or lawful permanent residents of the United States \nare liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies.” Id. at 40. \nSection 3 of the Proclamation provides that “all Alien Enemies described in section 1 of this \nproclamation are subject to immediate apprehension, detention, and removal, and . . . shall not \nbe permitted residence in the United States.” Id. Section 4 directs “the Attorney General and the \nSecretary of Homeland Security” to “apprehend, restrain, secure, and remove every Alien \nEnemy described in section 1.” Id.  \nAccording to Robert Cerna, Acting Field Office Director Enforcement and Removal \nOperations (“ERO”) at ICE, on March 15, 2025, “aliens” were removed to El Salvador after the \nAEA Proclamation took effect. ECF 227-2 at 46. On that date, ICE removed Cristian, a 20-year-\nold Class Member from Venezuela with a pending asylum application, to prison in El Salvador, \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 253     Filed 04/23/25     Page 5 of 19\nwhich Class Counsel argue is “in clear violation of the Settlement Agreement.” ECF 227-1 at 5. \nClass Counsel filed an Emergency Motion to Enforcement the Settlement Agreement, ECF 227, \nseeking “the Court’s intervention to order Defendants to remedy this violation of the Settlement \nAgreement and prevent any further such violations.” Id.  \nII.  Jurisdiction \nDefendants argue that this Court lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims. ECF 248 at 13. \nThis argument is a nonstarter. On November 25, 2024, this Court issued an Order granting final \napproval of the Settlement Agreement, “incorporated” the Agreement “by reference in [the] \nOrder,” and “directed” the parties “to implement and consummate the Agreement according to \nthe terms and provisions of the Agreement.” ECF 205 at 3. This Court maintains jurisdiction to \nenforce its own orders, and the Settlement Agreement in this matter is no different. See Fairfax \nCountywide Citizens Ass’n v. Fairfax Cty., 571 F.2d 1299, 1303 n.8 (4th Cir. 1978) (“Where the \nsettlement agreement is approved and incorporated into an order of court, the district court \npossesses jurisdiction to enforce its own order.”). \nMoreover,  the  Settlement  Agreement  and  this  Court’s  final  Order  approving  the \nSettlement  Agreement  both  clearly  provide  this  Court  with  jurisdiction  to  enforce  the \nAgreement’s terms. ECF 199-2 at 13, Section V.A (“This Court shall retain exclusive jurisdiction \nto supervise the implementation of this Settlement Agreement and to enforce its provisions and \nterms…”); ECF 205 at 3 (“The Court retains jurisdiction to enforce the Agreement during the \nterm of the Agreement[.]”). Contrary to Defendants’ assertions, the instant motion does not sound \nin habeas because Plaintiffs are not asking the Court to determine the scope of Defendants’ \nremoval authority under the AEA or challenging the application of the AEA to Cristian or any \nother  individual  Class  Member.  Rather,  Plaintiffs’  motion  “seeks  to  enforce  the  existing \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 253     Filed 04/23/25     Page 6 of 19\nSettlement Agreement,” ECF 227, which the Court clearly has jurisdiction to do. See ECF 199-2 \nat 13, Section V.A; ECF 205 at 3 (“Should any party to the Agreement fail to honor the terms of \nthis Order, the breaching party may petition for enforcement of this Order[.]”); Williams v. Pro. \nTransp., Inc., 388 F.3d 127, 132 (4th Cir. 2004) (“District courts have inherent authority, derived \nfrom their equity power, to enforce settlement agreements.”). \nAt  bottom,  this  case,  unlike  other  cases  involving  the  government’s  removal  of \nindividuals under the AEA, is a contractual dispute because of the Settlement Agreement, ECF \n199-2. See Davis v. Wash. Metro. Area Transit Auth., No. 23-1171, 2023 WL 7410855, at *2 (D. \nMd. Nov. 8, 2023) (“The question of whether to enforce a settlement agreement is governed by \n‘standard contract principles,’ because a settlement agreement is nothing more nor less than a \ncontract.”); Hensley v. Alcon Labs., Inc., 277 F.3d 535, 540-41 (4th Cir. 2002) (“[T]o exercise its \ninherent power to enforce a settlement agreement, a district court (1) must find that the parties \nreached a complete agreement and (2) must be able to determine its terms and conditions.”). \nNeither party disputes the existence of the Settlement Agreement, the terms of which are readily \nascertainable and were mutually agreed upon by both parties. See Lopez v. XTEL Const. Grp., \nLLC, 796 F. Supp. 2d 693, 699 (D. Md. 2011). This Court will thus apply standard contract \nprinciples to assess the enforceability of the Settlement Agreement. See Hayward v. Brown, No. \nPWG-15-3381, 2017 WL 2117364, at *2 (D.  Md. May 16, 2017) (“Under Maryland law, \n‘[s]ettlement agreements are enforceable as independent contracts, subject to the same general \nrules of construction that apply to other contracts.’” (citation omitted)). \nIII.  The Settlement Agreement \nA.  The Class Definition Does Not Exclude Individuals Who are Subject to \nthe AEA.5 \n \n5 This Court assumes, without deciding, for purposes of interpreting the Settlement Agreement \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 253     Filed 04/23/25     Page 7 of 19\nDefendants argue that removal of Cristian did not violate the Settlement Agreement \nbecause “his designation as an alien enemy pursuant to the AEA results in him ceasing to be a \nmember” of the Class as defined in Section II.E. ECF 248 at 16. Specifically, Defendants contend \nthat “aliens designated as alien enemies pursuant to the AEA are no longer eligible for asylum, a \nrequirement for class membership.” Id. \n  The Class Definition contains four elements. ECF 205 ¶ 2, ECF 199-2 at 5, Section II.E. \nDefendants contend that as to Cristian (and any Class Member against whom the AEA is \ninvoked), “prong No. 4 of the class definition is unmet” because the “AEA invocation moots the \nasylum application such that USCIS cannot adjudicate” and thus “adjudication is not pending.” \nECF 248 at 17. But, nothing in the plain language of the Class Definition or in the larger \nSettlement Agreement “requires that USCIS have a present ability to adjudicate the application \non the merits.” Id. Rather, the fourth prong of the Class Definition unambiguously states that the \nClass includes individuals “for  whom USCIS  has not adjudicated the individual’s asylum \napplication on the merits.” ECF 199-2 at 5, Section II.E. Section II.B defines “[a]djudicate on the \nmerits” as “to render a decision on the substance of an asylum claim by either granting an \napproval or issuing a determination of non-eligibility.” ECF 199-2 at 4. Defendants attempt to \nimport a temporal limitation into the fourth prong of the Class Definition for which there is no \nsupport within the four corners of the Settlement Agreement. See ACAS, LLC v. Charter Oak \nFire Ins. Co., 626 F. Supp. 3d 866, 874 (D. Md. 2022) (“When interpreting a contract’s terms, \ncourts must look to the entire language of the agreement, not merely a portion thereof, and must \nconsider the customary, ordinary and accepted meaning of the language used.” (cleaned up)). \nThe Settlement Agreement makes no mention of the AEA. As this Court has stated, \n \nthat Cristian is subject to the AEA Proclamation and that the AEA Proclamation is lawful. \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 253     Filed 04/23/25     Page 8 of 19\n“[n]othing in the plain language of the Class definition mentions the AEA or exempts any persons \notherwise meeting the Class definition from the protections the Settlement Agreement affords.” \nECF 247 at 3. Allegations that Class Members, like Cristian, are subject to the AEA do not \nexclude those individuals from the Class under the plain terms of the Settlement Agreement. \nDefendants do not dispute that Cristian meets the first three elements of the Class \nDefinition in Section II.E. ECF 248 at 17. As to the fourth element, “USCIS has not adjudicated” \nCristian’s application for asylum “on the merits” because USCIS has not “render[ed] a decision \non the substance of [his] asylum claim by either granting an approval or issuing a determination \nof non-eligibility.” ECF 199-2 at 4, Section II.B & at 5, Section II.E; ECF 228 (under seal) ¶ 6 & \nat 9. Thus, Cristian remains a Class Member and is still entitled to all rights afforded to him under \nthe Settlement Agreement. \nB.  Removal of a Class Member Who Has Not Received Final Adjudication \non the Merits by USCIS of a Properly Filed Asylum Application is a \nViolation of the Settlement Agreement. \nUnder Section III.I, the Settlement Agreement provides that “ICE will refrain from \nexecuting the Class Member’s final removal order until USCIS issues a Final Determination on \none properly filed application under the terms of this Agreement.” ECF 199-2 at 9. According to \nDefendants, “final removal order” as used in Section III.I “only applies to final orders of removal \nin removal proceedings under Title 8.” ECF 248 at 21. Thus, Defendants contend, “removal \npursuant to the AEA does not violate the settlement agreement” and therefore, removal of Cristian \ndid not violate the Settlement Agreement. Id.  \nHere again, Defendants attempt to add language to the Settlement Agreement that does \nnot comport with the Agreement’s plain terms. The Settlement Agreement does not define “final \nremoval order,” and as such, the Court “must give effect to its plain meaning and not contemplate \n \n8 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 253     Filed 04/23/25     Page 9 of 19\nwhat the parties may have subjectively intended…at the time of formulation.” ACAS, LLC, 626 \nF. Supp. 3d at 874 (citation omitted). In giving the terms their “customary” and “ordinary” \nmeaning, the Court looks to “the entire language of the agreement” and considers “the character \nof the contract, its purpose, and the facts and circumstances of the parties at the time of \nexecution.” Id. (citations omitted). The Defendants’ narrow definition of “final removal order” is \nnot supported by the language of the Settlement Agreement or the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding its execution. The Settlement Agreement specifically defines many terms in Section \nII, ECF 199-2 at 4-7, but it does not define or limit the phrase “final removal order.” Here, the \nAEA Proclamation served as a final removal order. Defendants executed Cristian’s final removal \nfrom the United States under the AEA Proclamation in contravention of their obligations under \nthe Settlement Agreement. Defendants to date, in the motions hearing and elsewhere, have \nrepeatedly asserted that AEA removal is final and irrevocable. \nThe Settlement Agreement does not limit the protection against removal provided in \nSection III.I to any specific statutory mechanism for removal. In a separate section dealing with \nprotection against removal when a motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement has been initiated, \nthe  Agreement  also  contains  no  limitation  on  the  type  of  removal,  stating  only  that  “the \ncomplaining Class Member shall not be removed from the United States unless and until the \nmatter has been resolved in favor of Defendants.” ECF No. 199-2 at 14, Section V.D.  \nFinally, Defendants’ proposed interpretation of Section III.I is not supported by the \ngeneral purpose of the Settlement Agreement, which was to address “a USCIS policy that would \nhave  resulted  in  the  improper  removal  of  many  Class  Members  by  causing  their  asylum \napplications to be rejected for lack of jurisdiction” and to allow “Class Members in removal \nproceedings to have their asylum applications adjudicated on the merits by USCIS while they \n \n9 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 253     Filed 04/23/25     Page 10 of 19\nremain in the United States with access to their counsel.” ECF 227-1 at 16. Indeed, a core purpose \nof  the  Settlement  Agreement  would  be  nullified  if  Class  Members  with  pending  asylum \napplications could be summarily removed from the United States and thus rendered ineligible for \nasylum. The Class Members’ “benefit of the bargain,” which they procured in exchange for \nreleasing, relinquishing, and discharging their class-wide claims, see ECF 199-2 at 14, consisted \nprimarily of the assurance that they would not be removed from the United States until USCIS \nadjudicated their asylum claims on their merits. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 17 (Am. \nLaw  Inst.  1981)  (“[T]he  formation  of  a  contract  requires  a  bargain  in  which  there  is  a \nmanifestation of mutual assent to the exchange and a consideration.”). Construing the undefined \nphrase “final removal order” in the narrow manner advocated by Defendants would relieve \nDefendants  of  their  obligation  to  uphold  the  promises  they  made  to  Class  Members  as \nconsideration for the relinquishment of Class Members’ action. Excepting removal under the \nAEA  from  the  requirements  of  the  Settlement  Agreement  would  also  render  Defendants’ \npromises illusory, a construction that violates the illusory promises doctrine. See M & G Polymers \nUSA, LLC v. Tackett, 574 U.S. 427, 440 (2015) (finding that the illusory promises doctrine \n“instructs courts to avoid constructions of contracts that would render promises illusory because \nsuch promises cannot serve as consideration for a contract”); 3 Williston on Contracts § 7:7 (4th \ned. May 2024 Update). And permitting Defendants to remove a Class Member without holding \nup their end of the bargain (which is to afford particular process to the pending asylum claims \nbefore removal) undermines the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing incorporated in every \ncontract. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 205 (Am. Law Inst. 1981) (“Every contract \nimposes upon each party a duty of good faith and fair dealing in its performance and its \nenforcement.”). \n \n10 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 253     Filed 04/23/25     Page 11 of 19\nTherefore, under the plain terms of the Settlement Agreement and fundamental tenets of \ncontract law, removal from the United States of a Class Member, including but not limited to \nCristian, without a final determination on the merits by USCIS on the Class Member’s pending \nasylum application violates the Settlement Agreement. \nC.  The Court Will Enforce the Terms of the Settlement Agreement. \nDefendants’  arguments  that  this  Court  should  find  Section  III  of  the  Settlement \nAgreement “void and unenforceable” because it “violates public policy,” ECF 248 at 26, carry \nno weight. Defendants have not even attempted to meet their burden under Federal Rule of \nProcedure 60(b) to procure relief from a final order and instead merely argue common law \nprinciples. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b); Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk Cty. Jail, 502 U.S. 367, 380 \n(1992) (“[A] party may obtain relief from a court order when it is no longer equitable that the \njudgment should have prospective application, not when it is no longer convenient to live with \nthe terms of a consent decree.” (citation omitted)). The parties finalized the Settlement Agreement \njust five months ago. ECF 205. While Defendants now assert “there is a strong public interest in \nensuring the safety of citizens of the United States and protecting them from foreign invasions \nand designated terrorist organizations,” ECF 248 at 26, Defendants have provided no evidence, \nor even any specific allegations, as to how Cristian, or any other Class Member, poses a threat to \npublic safety. Cf. ECF 248-1 ¶¶ 13-14 (“ICE determined that [Cristian] was subject to the [AEA] \nProclamation…On March 15, 2025, [Cristian] was removed under the [AEA]…as a Venezuelan \ncitizen 14 years of age or older who is a member of TdA.”). This Court is a court of evidence, \nresolving disputes by determining the facts based on evidence presented and applying relevant \nlaw to those facts.  \nAt the motions hearing, Defendants suggested that evidence would be prohibited, citing \n \n11 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 253     Filed 04/23/25     Page 12 of 19\nSection VIII.D of the Settlement Agreement, which states “that no extrinsic evidence whatsoever \nmay be introduced in any judicial or other proceeding, if any, involving the interpretation of this \nAgreement.” ECF 199-2 at 15. But here, Defendants are not asking this Court to make a \ndetermination “involving the interpretation of this Agreement.” Defendants are asking this Court \nto void the Settlement Agreement, which it just approved. The high bar of Rule 60(b) is not met \nby conclusory assertions alone. \nEven if Rule 60(b) did not apply, this Court would decline, in the absence of any \nparticularized showing, to void Section III of the Settlement Agreement on public policy grounds. \nIn  enforcing  the  Agreement’s  terms,  this  Court  takes  into  account  the  “public  interest  in \npreventing aliens from being wrongfully removed, particularly to countries where they are likely \nto face substantial harm,” Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 436 (2009), and the public’s “interest in \nseeing its governmental institutions follow the law,” Vitkus v. Blinken, 79 F.4th 352, 368 (4th \nCir. 2023) (citing Roe v. Dep’t of Def., 947 F.3d 207, 230-31 (4th Cir. 2020)). See also Alston v. \nTowneBank, No. GJH-20-690, 2022 WL 971008, at *6 (D. Md. Mar. 31, 2022) (noting that \n“public policy considerations favor the enforcement of settlement agreements”). The fact that \nDefendants may have “second thoughts about the results of a settlement agreement does not \njustify setting aside an otherwise valid agreement.” Young v. FDIC, 103 F.3d 1180, 1195 (4th \nCir. 1997). \nD.  Remedies \nDefendants have breached the terms of the Settlement Agreement by removing at least \none Class Member from the United States while his asylum application remains pending with \nUSCIS. It is an axiomatic principle of contract law that when a defendant breaches a contract, \nthat defendant must restore the situation that existed before the breach. See Restatement (Second) \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 253     Filed 04/23/25     Page 13 of 19\nof Contracts § 347 cmt. a (Am. Law Inst. 1981) (“Contract damages are ordinarily based on the \ninjured party’s expectation interest and are intended to give him the benefit of his bargain…[and] \nput him in as good a position as he would have been in had the contract been performed.”); id. § \n344 cmt. a (“Ordinarily, when a court concludes that there has been a breach of contract, it \nenforces the broken promise by protecting the expectation that the injured party had when he \nmade the contract…[and] attempting to put him in as good a position as he would have been in \nhad the contract been performed, that is, had there been no breach.”); Hewitt v. Dyck-O’Neal, \nInc., No. 20-1322, 2021 WL 3784867, at *1 (D. Md. Aug. 26, 2021) (describing a motion to \nenforce  a settlement agreement as  “tantamount  to  an  action  for  specific  performance  of \na contract” (citation omitted)). In the case of Cristian, this requires putting him in the position “to \nensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El \nSalvador.” Noem v. Abrego Garcia, No. 24-A949, 604 U.S. __, 2025 WL 1077101, at *1 (Apr. \n10, 2025). In other words, under contract law principles, Cristian, and any other Class Member \nwho has been removed in violation of the Settlement Agreement, must be returned to the United \nStates to await adjudication of his asylum application on the merits by USCIS. See ECF 199-2 at \n9, Section III.I. \nOf course, that ruling puts this case squarely into the procedural morass that has been \nplaying out very publicly, across many levels of the federal judiciary, in Abrego Garcia v. Noem, \nNo. 8:25-cv-00951 (D. Md.). As of the date of this order, discovery is underway regarding the \ngovernment’s efforts to comply with court orders (including from the United States Supreme \nCourt) to “facilitate” Mr. Abrego Garcia’s return to the United States. See id. at ECF 79. This \nCourt is mindful of the Supreme Court’s reminder to afford the “deference owed to the Executive \nBranch in the conduct of foreign affairs.” Noem, 2025 WL 1077101, at *2. However, this Court \n \n13 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 253     Filed 04/23/25     Page 14 of 19\nis also guided by, and fully agrees with, the definition of “facilitate” espoused by Judge Xinis \nand the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Abrego Garcia. See No. 8:25-\ncv-00951, ECF 79 at 4 (D. Md. Apr. 15, 2025) (“Defendants therefore remain obligated, at a \nminimum, to take the steps available to them toward aiding, assisting, or making easier Abrego \nGarcia’s release from custody in El Salvador and resuming his status quo ante.”); No. 25-1404 \n(4th Cir. Apr. 17, 2025) (“‘Facilitate’ is an active verb. It requires steps to be taken as the Supreme \nCourt has made perfectly clear…The plain and active meaning of the word cannot be diluted by \nits constriction…to a narrow term of art.”); Abrego Garcia v. Noem, No. 25-1345, 2025 WL \n1021113, at *6 (4th Cir. Apr. 7, 2025) (Wilkinson, J. concurring) (noting that removed individuals \n“can be afforded effective relief by facilitation of their return”). Standing by and taking no action \nis not facilitation. In prior cases involving wrongfully removed individuals, courts have ordered, \nand the government has taken, affirmative steps toward facilitating return. See Nat’l Immigr. \nProject of Nat’l Laws. Guild, No. 11-CV-3235 JSR, ECF No. 79-4 at 40-46 (S.D.N.Y. July 16, \n2014)  (describing  “the  government’s  procedures  for  facilitating  return”  after  removal  of \nnoncitizen); id., ECF 16-4 at 19-25 (engaging ICE Attaché in South Africa to facilitate the return \nof a removed noncitizen in Ethiopia); id., ECF No. 38-6 at 31 (working with U.S. Embassy in \nTokyo to secure return of removed noncitizen); Hamama v. Adducci, No. 2:17-cv-11910, ECF \n513 (E.D. Mich. Jan. 15, 2019) (ordering defendants to “use all best efforts to ensure” return of \nnoncitizen who was removed in violation of court’s order and providing specific directives to \nfacilitate return).  \nThus, like Judge Xinis in the Abrego Garcia matter, this Court will order Defendants to \nfacilitate Cristian’s return to the United States so that he can receive the process he was entitled \nto under the parties’ binding Settlement Agreement. This Court further orders that facilitating \n \n14 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 253     Filed 04/23/25     Page 15 of 19\nCristian’s return includes, but is not limited to, Defendants making a good faith request to the \ngovernment of El Salvador to release Cristian to U.S. custody for transport back to the United \nStates to await the adjudication of his asylum application on the merits by USCIS.6 \nE.  Motions to Proceed Under Pseudonym \nClass Counsel filed two motions, ECF 231, 236, seeking to maintain the anonymity of the \nClass Members at issue in their filings by proceeding under pseudonym.7 Specifically, Class \nCounsel notes that the Court has previously permitted the Named Plaintiffs in this litigation to \nproceed by pseudonym, ECF 55, 116, and requests that other Class Members be permitted to do \nthe same because of “the strong public interest in restricting the asylum seeker’s identity from \nthe public;” the “risk of retaliation to the Class Member if his identity is made public;” and the \nlack of any prejudice to Defendants, who are aware of the Class Members’ identities. ECF 231 \nat 2, ECF 236 at 2. Defendants object, arguing that Plaintiffs “have not established that the \nprivacy concerns at issue outweigh the significant public interest in open proceedings.” ECF 249 \nat 1. \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 10(a) mandates generally that pleadings contain the \nnames of parties. However, courts may exercise their discretion in allowing parties to proceed by \npseudonym and consider “the circumstances of particular cases,” including “that privacy or \nconfidentiality concerns are sometimes sufficiently critical.” James v. Jacobson, 6 F.3d 233, 238 \n(4th Cir. 1993) (noting “a judicial duty to inquire into the circumstances of particular cases to \n \n6 Of course, the Settlement Agreement does not entitle Class Members to USCIS approval of an \nasylum application. The Agreement does not guarantee results, but it does guarantee process. \nDefendants have deprived Cristian of the benefit of the Class’s bargain. \n \n7 ECF 236 relates to a motion for Temporary Restraining Order concerning a Class Member \ncalled “Javier.” ECF 235. At present, to this Court’s understanding, Javier remains in the United \nStates. \n \n15 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 253     Filed 04/23/25     Page 16 of 19\ndetermine whether the dispensation is warranted”). The Fourth Circuit has articulated a list of \nnon-exhaustive factors “as guides to a proper exercise of discretion”: \n[(1)] whether the justification asserted by the requesting party is merely to avoid the \nannoyance and criticism that may attend any litigation or is to preserve privacy in a \nmatter of sensitive and highly personal nature; [(2)] whether identification poses a risk \nof retaliatory physical or mental harm to the requesting party or even more critically, \nto innocent non-parties; [(3)] the ages of the persons whose privacy interests are sought \nto be protected; [(4)] whether the action is against a governmental or private party; and \n[(5)] the risk of unfairness to the opposing party from allowing an action against it to \nproceed anonymously.  \nJames v. Jacobson, 6 F.3d 233, 238–39 (4th Cir. 1993).  \nThe Class Members at issue here are two “Venezuelan youth seeking asylum in the United \nStates.” ECF 231-1 at 4; ECF 236-1 at 4. Courts have addressed “the unique vulnerabilities of asylum \nseekers” and “allowed them to proceed pseudonymously as a result.” Doe v. U.S. Immigr. & Customs \nEnf’t, No. 1:23-cv-00971-MLG-JMR, 2024 WL 4389461, at *2 (D.N.M. Oct. 3, 2024) (collecting \ncases). Here, Plaintiffs’ declarations make clear that they do not seek to proceed under pseudonym \n“merely to avoid…annoyance and criticism” but “to preserve privacy” and security in a “sensitive” \nmatter. See James, 6 F.3d at 238; ECF 228 (under seal) ¶ 5 (Class Member Cristian came to the United \nStates “fleeing danger and threats in Venezuela”); ECF 242 (under seal) ¶¶ 5-6 (Class Member Javier \ncame to the United States “to escape political violence in Venezuela that directly targeted his \nfamily.”). Relatedly, Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that disclosure of their identities poses a risk \nof retaliatory harm. Plaintiffs clearly face the risk of retaliatory harm in their home country, as well \nas in detention in El Salvador and potentially within the United States, if their identities are made \npublic. The threat of physical retaliatory harm within El Salvador’s prisons and within the United \nStates  has  prompted  other  courts  considering  analogous  factual  circumstances  to  permit \npseudonymity. See, e.g., D.B.U. v. Trump, No. 25-cv-1163, ECF 11 (D. Colo. Apr. 14, 2025); G.F.F. \nv. Trump, No. 25-cv 2886, ECF 10 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 8, 2025). The first and second James factors thus \nweigh in favor of permitting Plaintiffs to proceed under pseudonym.  \n \n16 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 253     Filed 04/23/25     Page 17 of 19\nAs to the third James factor, Cristian is 20 years old, ECF 231-1 at 5, and Javier is 18 years \nold, ECF 236-1 at 5. While these Plaintiffs are no longer minors, this Court has previously permitted \nNamed Plaintiffs, who were all at least 18 years old when this litigation was filed, to proceed using a \npseudonym, see ECF 91, 55, 116. Moreover, early in this litigation, this Court approved a Protective \nOrder  that  directs  the  parties  to  maintain  the  confidentiality  of  Class  Members’  “identifying \ninformation” including “their names.” ECF 136-1 at 2-3 (“Plaintiffs’ and other putative class \nmembers’ identifying information, including their names…shall be subject to the terms of this Order, \nand pursuant to the Court’s orders granting Plaintiffs’ motions to proceed using pseudonyms, the \nParties will, in all public documents or Court filings or discussions in open Court, reference Plaintiffs \nand other putative class members only by their initials”); ECF 144 at 3 (order entering proposed \nprotective order). Thus, this factor also leans in favor of maintaining Plaintiffs’ anonymity via using \npseudonyms. \nThe final two James factors also weigh in favor of Plaintiffs. While “there is a heightened \npublic interest when an individual or entity files a suit against the government,” Plaintiffs’ individual \nidentities here are “incidental to the adjudication of [their] claims,” which seek to enforce their rights \nunder the Settlement Agreement. P.K. v. U.S. Customs & Border Prot., No. 22-1983, 2022 WL \n22626436, at *3 (D.D.C. July 12, 2022) (citation omitted). Finally, Plaintiffs’ identities are already \nknown to Defendants, and Defendants do not argue that they are prejudiced in any way if Cristian \nand Javier proceed by pseudonym.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n17 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 253     Filed 04/23/25     Page 18 of 19\nIV.  Conclusion \nFor the reasons set forth above, Class Counsel’s Emergency Motion to Enforce the \nSettlement Agreement, ECF 227, and Motions to Proceed Under Pseudonym, ECF 231, 236, \nwill be GRANTED.

Note, for this and all court documents cited herein, page \nnumbers refer to the those contained in the red or blue headers that the CM/ECF system \ngenerates upon filing.    \n \n3 Below, the Government argued that Cristian was not a Class Member and that the \n“court  . . . lacks  jurisdiction  to  review  Plaintiffs’  collateral  challenge  to  Cristian’s \nremoval.”  J.O.P. v. United States Dep’t of Homeland Sec., No. 8:19-CV-01944-SAG (D. \nMd. PACER No. 248 at 16).  In its motion to stay, the Government abandons these lines \nof argument.   \n \n2 \n \n\nto enforce the Settlement Agreement, granted the Plaintiffs’ emergency motion to enforce \nthe Settlement Agreement.  The district court ordered that the Government “facilitate” \nCristian’s return to the United States to await adjudication of his asylum application on the \nmerits.  The Government now asks that we stay this order pending appeal.  A majority of \nthis panel votes to deny the Government’s motion to stay pending appeal.  I write to explain \nmy view. \n \nI. \nA. \nIn 2019, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 551 et seq., and \nthe  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fifth  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution, \nPlaintiffs brought an action for declaratory and injunctive relief.  The complaint alleged \nthe Government, in a May 31, 2019, USCIS memorandum, unlawfully modified policies \ngoverning treatment of asylum applications by unaccompanied alien children (“UAC”).4     \nIn 2024, the parties reached a final settlement agreement that provided relief to a \ncertified class of young asylum seekers previously determined to be UACs, and the district \ncourt granted final approval of the Settlement Agreement on November 25, 2024.  The \n \n4 Under the Settlement Agreement, an “unaccompanied alien child” or “UAC” is \n“ ‘a child who—(A) has no lawful immigration status in the United States; (B) has not \nattained 18 years of age; and (C) with respect to whom—(i) there is no parent or legal \nguardian in the United States; or (ii) no parent or legal guardian in the United States is \navailable to provide care and physical custody,’ as set forth in 6 U.S.C. § 279(g)(2).”  \nJ.O.P., PACER No. 199-2 at 6. \n \n3 \n \n\nSettlement Agreement defines the certified Class as “all individuals nationwide who prior \nto [February 24, 2025]: (1) were determined to be a UAC; and (2) who filed an asylum \napplication that was pending with USCIS; and (3) on the date they filed their asylum \napplication with USCIS, were 18 years of age or older, or had a parent or legal guardian in \nthe United States who is available to provide care and physical custody; and (4) for whom \nUSCIS has not adjudicated the individual’s asylum application on the merits.”  J.O.P., \nPACER No. 199-2 at 5.  \nSection III.B provides that “USCIS will exercise Initial Jurisdiction over Class \nMembers’ asylum applications in accordance with the terms of this Settlement Agreement \nand adjudicate them on the merits.”  Id. at 7.  Further, Section III.I provides that “[w]ith \nrespect to any Class Member with a final removal order, ICE [United States Immigration \nand Customs Enforcement] will refrain from executing the Class Member’s final removal \norder until USCIS issues a Final Determination on one properly filed asylum application \nunder the terms of this Agreement.”  Id. at 9.  And Section V.D provides that “[i]n the event \nof an alleged noncompliance with this Settlement Agreement, . . . the complaining Class \nMember shall not be removed from the United States” once a motion to enforce the \nSettlement Agreement has been filed “unless and until the matter has been resolved in favor \nof Defendants.”  Id. at 14.  \nB. \nOn  March  14,  2025,  President  Donald  J.  Trump  signed  a  proclamation  titled \n“Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act [“AEA”] Regarding the Invasion of the United States \nby Tren de Aragua” (the “Proclamation”).  Proclamation No. 10903, 90 C.F.R. § 13033 \n4 \n \n\n(March 14, 2025).  Section 1 of the Proclamation directed that “all Venezuelan citizens 14 \nyears of age or older who are members of [Tren de Aragua (“TdA”)], are within the United \nStates, and are not actually naturalized or lawful permanent residents of the United States \nare liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies.”  Id. at \n13034.  Section 3 of the Proclamation provides that “all Alien Enemies described in section \n1 of this proclamation are subject to immediate apprehension, detention, and removal, and \nfurther that they shall not be permitted residence in the United States.”  Id.  Section 4 directs \n“the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security” to “apprehend, restrain, \nsecure, and remove every Alien Enemy described in section 1.”  Id.   \nThe day after the President issued the Proclamation, ICE removed Cristian—a 20-\nyear-old Class Member from Venezuela with a pending asylum application—from its \ncustody in Texas to a prison in El Salvador.  See Stay Mot. at 10–11 (admitting Cristian “is \na class member under the settlement agreement and has filed an asylum application before \nUSCIS on December 20, 2022”).  Plaintiffs contend that Cristian is being held at the Centro \nde  Confinamiento  del  Terrorismo,  commonly  known  as  CECOT,  Appellees’  Opp’n \nAppellants’ Mot. Stay Pending Appeal, (ECF No. 24) at 8 (hereinafter “Resp. Br.”), “a \nnotorious supermax prison known for widespread human rights violations,” see Abrego \nGarcia v. Noem, No. 25-1345, 2025 WL 1021113, at *1 (4th Cir. Apr. 7, 2025) (hereinafter \n5 \n \n\n“Abrego Garcia I”) (Thacker, J., concurring).  In its reply, the Government does not deny \nthis assertion.5  \nC. \nPlaintiffs’ Class counsel moved before the district court to enforce the Settlement \nAgreement, and the district court granted Class counsel’s motion.  Pertinent here, the \ndistrict court ordered that Defendants “facilitate Class Member Cristian’s return to the \nUnited States to await the adjudication of his asylum application on the merits by USCIS \nunder the terms of the Settlement Agreement.  Facilitation includes, but is not limited to, a \ngood faith request by Defendants to the government of El Salvador to release Cristian to \nU.S. custody for transport back to the United States.”  J.O.P., PACER No. 254 at 2. \nThe Government then moved, under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5), to vacate or stay the \nportion of the district court’s order directing the Government to facilitate Cristian’s return.  \nSee J.O.P., PACER No. 261.  The Government pointed to a May 1, 2025 “Indicative \nAsylum Decision” USCIS issued wherein it declared that, if Cristian were returned to the \nUnited  States,  it  would  deny  his  asylum  application  based  on  (1)  terrorist-related \ninadmissibility grounds (membership in TdA), and (2) as a matter of discretion, based on \nboth membership in TdA and a felony conviction for possession of cocaine.  J.O.P., \nPACER No. 262 at 5 (SEALED).  The Government argued that facilitating Cristian’s return \n \n5 Judge Richardson questions whether Cristian is actually at CECOT or some other \nfacility in El Salvador.  See Diss. Op. at 46 n.7.  For our purposes, however, two things \nmatter.  First, that the Government removed Cristian from the United States—a fact not in \ndispute.  And second, that this removal violated the Settlement Agreement, as Cristian \nargues. \n6 \n \n\nwas no longer “warranted or equitable” because Cristian was “no longer a member of the \nclass.”  Id. (SEALED).  The district court held a hearing on the Government’s motion.   \nThe district court denied the motion to vacate but granted the motion to stay to \npermit the Government time to docket an appeal in this court.  The Government docketed \nits appeal.  It  now moves to stay the district court’s “facilitation” order and further \nchallenges the district court’s denial of its Rule 60(b)(5) motion.    \n \nII. \nA. \n“A stay is not a matter of right,” but is “instead an exercise of judicial discretion.”  \nNken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 433 (2009) (cleaned up).  As the party seeking relief, the \nGovernment bears the burden of demonstrating “that the circumstances justify an exercise \nof that discretion.”  Id. at 433–34.  In making that determination, we must consider the \nfollowing factors: \n(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that [it] is likely to \nsucceed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured \nabsent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the \nother parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest \nlies.   \n \nId. at 434.  While the last two factors merge “when the Government is the opposing party,” \nid. at 435, they remain “distinct” here, where the Government is the party seeking the stay, \nAbrego Garcia I, 2025 WL 1021113, at *2 (Thacker, J., concurring) (quoting U.S. Navy \nSeals 1-26 v. Biden, 27 F.4th 336, 353 (5th Cir. 2022)).  The Government argues it is \n7 \n \n\nentitled to a stay because: (1) it is likely to succeed on the merits and (2) the equities favor \nthe Government. \nB. \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5) provides that: \nOn  motion  and  just  terms,  the  court  may  relieve  a  party  or  its  legal \nrepresentative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding [where] . . . the \njudgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged; it is based on an earlier \njudgment that has been reversed or vacated; or applying it prospectively is \nno longer equitable. \n \n“A party seeking modification of a decree as ‘no longer equitable’ has the ‘burden \nof establishing that a significant change in circumstances warrants revision of the decree.’ ”  \nL.J. v. Wilbon, 633 F.3d 297, 304–05 (4th Cir. 2011) (quoting Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk \nCnty. Jail, 502 U.S. 367, 383 (1992)).  “A party ‘may meet its initial burden by showing \neither a significant change either in factual conditions or in law’ that makes ‘enforcement \nof the decree . . . detrimental to the public interest.’ ”  Id. at 305 (quoting Rufo, 502 U.S. at \n384).  This court reviews the district court’s denial of the Government’s Rule 60(b)(5) \nmotion for abuse of discretion.  Id. at 304.   \n \nIII. \nA. \ni. \nI begin with whether the Government has made a “strong showing” of success on \nthe merits.  See Nken, 556 U.S. at 434.  The Government presents a narrow argument—it \ndid not breach the Settlement Agreement because removals pursuant to the AEA are not \n8 \n \n\n“final removal orders” under the agreement.  Stay Mot. at 15–16.  Put differently, the \nGovernment argues that because removals under the AEA are not “final removal orders,” \nICE was not obliged to wait until USCIS had issued a “Final Determination” on Cristian’s \nasylum application before removing him.  Cristian, by contrast, argues that the term “final \nremoval order” is reasonably read to include AEA removals.  He further argues—and the \nGovernment does not contest—that the Proclamation expressly orders “removal” and that \n“Defendants have represented that such removals are ‘final.’ ”  See Resp. Br. at 6; see also \ngenerally Reply Br.     \nii. \nMaryland6 courts follow the objective theory of contract interpretation.  Tapestry, \nInc. v. Factory Mut. Ins. Co., 286 A.3d 1044, 1053 (Md. 2022). “Under that approach, \nunless  the  language  of  the  contract  is  ambiguous,  we  interpret  it  ‘based  on  what  a \nreasonable person in the position of the parties would have understood the language to \nmean and “not the subjective intent of the parties at the time of formation.” ’ ”  Id. (quoting \nCredible Behav. Health, Inc. v. Johnson, 220 A.3d 303, 310 (Md. 2019)).  Therefore, it is \n“the written language embodying the terms of an agreement [that] will govern the rights \nand liabilities of the parties, irrespective of the intent of the parties at the time they entered \ninto the contract.”  Id. (quoting Md. Cas. Co. v. Blackstone Int’l Ltd., 114 A.3d 676, 681 \n(Md. 2015)). \n \n6 The parties agree that Maryland law governs interpretation of the Settlement \nAgreement.   \n9 \n \n\nI do not believe the Government has made a “strong” showing that the term “final \nremoval order” excludes AEA removal orders.  The Settlement Agreement defines many \nkey terms—“Adjudicate on the merits” and “Final Determination” to name two—but does \nnot define “final removal order.”  See J.O.P., PACER No. 199-2 at 4–7.  In context, reading \n“final removal order” to include removals under the AEA is not unreasonable.  See \nCredible Behav. Health, 220 A.3d at 310–11 (quoting Ocean Petroleum, Co. v. Yanek, 5 \nA.3d 683, 691 (Md. 2010)) (“Ascertaining the parties’ intentions requires us to consider \nthe plain language of the disputed contractual provisions ‘in context, which includes not \nonly the text of the entire contract but also the contract’s character, purpose, and the “facts \nand circumstances of the parties at the time of execution.” ’ ”).   \nThe purpose behind the Settlement Agreement was to prevent asylum applicants \nfrom being removed during the pendency of their application—or, as the district court put \nit, to stop “a USCIS policy that would have resulted in the improper removal of many Class \nMembers by causing their asylum applications to be rejected for lack of jurisdiction” and \nto  allow  “Class  Members  in  removal  proceedings  to  have  their  asylum  applications \nadjudicated on the merits by USCIS while they remain in the United States with access to \ntheir counsel.”  See J.O.P. v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., No. 8:19-CV-01944-SAG, 2025 \nWL 1180191, at *5 (D. Md. Apr. 23, 2025) (cleaned up).  This context shows the broad \nscope of the litigation and highlights that the parties chose not to link the definition of \n“final removal order” to asylum proceedings only.   \nThe Settlement Agreement’s enforcement mechanism’s text likewise supports this \ninference.  Section V.D provides that when a motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement \n10 \n \n\nis filed, removal of any kind is forbidden.  J.O.P., PACER No. 199-2 at 14 (“Once such a \nmotion to enforce is initiated, the complaining Class Member shall not be removed from \nthe United States unless and until the matter has been resolved in favor of Defendants.”).  \nThis language is free of qualifiers from which a reasonable person could assume that \nremovals under the AEA would be excluded.  “[T]he written language embodying the \nterms  of  an  agreement  . . . govern  the  rights  and  liabilities  of  the  parties,”  Lithko \nContracting, LLC v. XL Ins. Am., Inc., 318 A.3d 1221, 1230 (Md. 2024) (quoting Tapestry, \n286 A.3d at 1053), not their “subjective intent . . . at the time of formation,” Tapestry, 286 \nA.3d at 1053 (quoting Credible Behav. Health, 220 A.3d at 310).  Accordingly, Section \nV.D’s structure supports the inference that the parties deliberately chose not to limit the \ntypes of removals which trigger Section III.I’s protections.  \nIn sum, reading “final removal order” to apply to the Government’s conduct here \ndemonstrates fidelity to the Settlement Agreement’s language.  See Calomiris v. Woods, \n727 A.2d 358, 368 (Md. 1999) (quoting Canaras v. Lift Truck Servs., 322 A.2d 866, 873 \n(Md. 1974)) (“It is a fundamental principle of contract law that it is ‘improper for the court \nto rewrite the terms of a contract, or draw a new contract for the parties, when the terms \nthereof are clear and unambiguous, simply to avoid hardships.’ ”).  It heeds the factors \nMaryland  law  contemplates—the  “contract’s  character,  purpose,  and  ‘the  facts  and \ncircumstances of the parties at the time of execution.’ ”  Ocean Petroleum, Co., 5 A.3d at \n691 (quoting Pac. Indem. Co. v. Interstate Fire & Cas. Co., 488 A.2d 486, 488 (Md. 1985)); \nsee Auction & Est. Representatives, Inc. v. Ashton, 731 A.2d 441, 444 (Md. 1999) (“[T]he \nclear and unambiguous language of an agreement will not give way to what the parties \n11 \n \n\nthought the agreement meant or was intended to mean.”) (citing Adloo v. H.T. Brown Real \nEstate, Inc., 686 A.2d 298, 305 (Md. 1996)). \nB. \nAs to the remaining Nken factors, I believe they favor Cristian.   \ni. \na. \nThe Government argues it will suffer irreparable harm because the President’s \nauthority under the AEA will be “undermine[d]” if it is required to facilitate Cristian’s \nreturn to the United States.  The Government’s argument entirely ignores the Supreme \nCourt’s decision in Noem v. Abrego Garcia, 145 S. Ct. 1017 (2025) (hereinafter “Abrego \nGarcia II”).  There, the Government wrongfully removed Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia \nto El Salvador despite his withholding of removal order specifically forbidding his removal \nto that country.  Id. at 1018.  The district court required that the Government “facilitate” \nAbrego Garcia’s return to the United States.  The Supreme Court unanimously affirmed \nthat “the [District Court’s] order properly requires the Government to ‘facilitate’ Abrego \nGarcia’s release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it \nwould have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.”  Id. (emphasis added); \nsee also Abrego Garcia I, 2025 WL 1021113, at *6 (Wilkinson, J., concurring) (“In this \nsituation, I think it legitimate for the district court to require that the government ‘facilitate’ \nthe plaintiff’s return to the United States so that he may assert the rights that all apparently \nagree are due him under law.  It is fair to read the district court’s order as one requiring that \nthe government facilitate Abrego Garcia’s release, rather than demand it.”).   \n12 \n \n\nHere, Cristian was removed from the United States in breach of the Settlement \nAgreement.    The  argument  that  the  Government  would  be  “irreparably  harmed”  by \nfacilitating Cristian’s return rings hollow.  See Abrego Garcia I, 2025 WL 1021113, at *5 \n(Thacker, J., concurring) (“[T]he Government is not irreparably harmed by facilitating and \neffectuating the return of a person within its control who was wrongfully removed from \nthe United States.”).    \nb. \nThe dissent chastises the district court for going beyond what the Supreme Court \nand this court endorsed in Abrego Garcia.  That could not be further from the truth.  \nIn Abrego Garcia II, the Supreme Court agreed with a prior concurring view of our \ncolleague––Judge  Wilkinson––in  finding  that  a  court  could  order  the  government  to \n“facilitate” the return of an improperly deported individual but could not demand it.  See \n145 S. Ct. at 1018.  On remand, the district court defined facilitate as “at a minimum, to \ntake the steps available to [the government] toward aiding, assisting, or making easier \nAbrego Garcia’s release from custody in El Salvador and resuming his status quo ante.”  \nAbrego Garcia v. Noem, No. 8:25-CV-00951-PX, 2025 WL 1113440, at *2 (D. Md. Apr. \n15, 2025).  This court affirmed.  See Abrego Garcia v. Noem, No. 25-1404, 2025 WL \n1135112, at *1 (4th Cir. Apr. 17, 2025) (hereinafter “Abrego Garcia III”).  The court made \nclear that “facilitate” is “an active verb” and “requires that steps be taken” to achieve the \nrelief Abrego Garcia II deemed proper.  Id. at 1.  This court further made clear “[t]he \nSupreme Court’s decision does not . . . allow the government to do essentially nothing.”  \nId. \n13 \n \n\nHere, the district court required Defendants make “a good faith request . . . to the \ngovernment of El Salvador to release Cristian to U.S. custody for transport back to the \nUnited States.”  J.O.P., PACER No. 254 at 2.  Judge Richardson claims that this command \nconstitutes forced “negotiation with a foreign state.”  Diss. Op. at 36.  But the Government \ncannot  facilitate  Cristian’s  return  telepathically—it  must  express  in  words  to  the \ngovernment of El Salvador that Cristian be released for transport back to the United States.  \nSee Abrego Garcia III, 2025 WL 1135112, at *1 (rejecting the government’s argument that \n“all  it  must  do  is  ‘remove  any  domestic  barriers  to  [Abrego  Garcia’s]  return’ ”  and \nemphasizing  that  the  argument  was  “not  well  taken  in  light  of  the  Supreme  Court's \ncommand that the government facilitate Abrego Garcia’s  release from custody in El \nSalvador”).  In sum, the district court’s command here was no different than the language \nwe approved in Abrego Garcia III.   \nI highlight one last point.  The district court required that the Government’s request \nto El Salvador be “a good faith” one.  This requirement is critical.  Abrego Garcia II held \nthat the government can be ordered to “facilitate” the return of wrongfully removed \nindividuals.    See  145  S.  Ct.  at  1018.    The  Supreme  Court  could  not  have  possibly \ncontemplated permitting the Government to act in bad faith when facilitating a wrongfully \nremoved individual’s return—that would defy logic.  See Abrego Garcia III, 2025 WL \n1135112, at *1 (“The Supreme Court’s decision does not . . . allow the government to do \nessentially nothing.”).  The district court’s use of the phrase “good faith request” only \nexplained the minimum that the Government must do and does not run afoul of Supreme \nCourt precedent.   \n14 \n \n\nIn sum, the second Nken factor favors Cristian.      \nii. \nNken factor three—injury to the other party in the proceeding: here, Cristian—also \nweighs in Cristian’s favor.  Cristian contends, and the Government does not dispute, that \nhe is being held at CECOT, “a notorious supermax prison known for widespread human \nrights violations.”  See Abrego Garcia I, 2025 WL 1021113, at *1 (Thacker, J., concurring).  \nIssuing the Government’s requested stay would likely harm Cristian—both physically and \nby  depriving  him  of  his  rights  under  the  Settlement  Agreement  to  have  his  asylum \napplication adjudicated on the merits.  Therefore this factor clearly favors Cristian.       \nLast,  the  public  interest  lies  with  denying  the  Government’s  motion  to  stay.  \nPointing to the Indicative Asylum Decision—which I discuss in the next section—the \nGovernment argues Cristian is a terrorist who cannot obtain asylum.  “Perhaps, but perhaps \nnot.”  See Abrego Garcia III, 2025 WL 1135112, at *1.  The Settlement Agreement \nprovided that Cristian’s asylum application would be heard in person on the merits—not \ndenied by default because Cristian had been removed from the United States and accused, \nin absentia, of charges to which he cannot practically respond.  Cf. Abrego Garcia I, 2025 \nWL 1021113, at *6 (Thacker, J., concurring) (“[U]pholding constitutional rights surely \nserves the public interest.”) (quoting Giovani Carandola, Ltd. v. Bason, 303 F.3d 507, 521 \n(4th Cir. 2002)).  Accordingly, the final Nken factor favors Cristian.   \niii. \nJudge Richardson views the equitable question differently.  See Diss. Op. at 42–48.  \nHe contends that the equities favor the Government because Cristian cannot prove that he \n15 \n \n\nis not a terrorist.  See, e.g., id. at 43.  This gets things backward.  Cristian’s injury arises \nfrom the fact that instead of having his asylum application adjudicated on the merits—as \nthe Settlement Agreement guaranteed—he was summarily removed.  The removal denied \nCristian the chance to dispute on the merits the very accusations the Government now puts \nforth on appeal to justify its breach.  The Government’s breach denied Cristian the benefit \nof the bargain and the process he was due.  This deprivation is exactly the “real-world \nharm” the Settlement Agreement was designed to protect against.  Id. at 45. \n*    *    * \nFor the above reasons, I do not believe that the Nken factors favor a stay pending \nappeal.  \n \nIV. \nFinally, I consider the district court’s denial of the Government’s Rule 60(b)(5) \nmotion.  The Government moved the district court to vacate the facilitation order based on \nUSCIS’s May 1, 2025 “Indicative Asylum Decision.”  The Government contended that \nCristian’s return was “no longer equitable or appropriate” because USCIS had determined \nthat Cristian—if returned to the United States for adjudication of his application—would \nbe “barred” from obtaining asylum.  J.O.P., PACER No. 262 at 11–12 (arguing that \nCristian’s claims for relief were “moot” because the Indicative Asylum Decision was in \nfact an “adjudication on the merits,” the “precise relief” Cristian sought) (SEALED). \nA. \n16 \n \n\nBefore discussing its  contents, I explain the context of the Indicative Asylum \nDecision’s issuance.   \nCristian was removed from the United States on March 15, 2025.  On April 23, \n2025, the district court entered its order to enforce the Settlement Agreement and required \nthat the Government facilitate Cristian’s return.  Eight days later, on May 1, 2025, USCIS \nissued  the  Indicative Asylum  Decision.    And  three days  later,  on  May  4,  2025,  the \nGovernment moved under Rule 60(b)(5) to vacate the district court’s facilitation order \nbased on “significant” changed circumstances—namely the Indicative Asylum Decision’s \nissuance.  \nB. \nWith this context in mind, I now describe the Indicative Asylum Decision.  This \ndocument  states  that  USCIS  possessed  evidence  showing  Cristian  was  ineligible  for \nasylum.  USCIS asserted it possessed “government records provided by a federal law \nenforcement partner[] [stating that] the applicant [Cristian] admitted to being a member of \nTdA.”  J.O.P., PACER No. 263 at 3 (SEALED).  USCIS also asserted it reviewed “law \nenforcement records containing statements from state law enforcement partners that the \napplicant was identified as TdA by a ‘reliable CI,’ ” “information about [Cristian’s] social \nmedia activity,” and “photographic evidence of tattoos.”  Id. (SEALED). \nThe district court denied the Government’s Rule 60(b)(5) motion.  The district court \nobserved that the Government was measuring changed circumstances, “futility,” and the \nequities by “the wrong yardstick.”  See J.O.P., PACER No. 272 at 29–30.  The question, \nthe district court continued, was not whether Cristian “ultimately received asylum,” but \n17 \n \n\n“whether he ha[d] received the process that the class bargained for when the Settlement \nAgreement was entered.”  Id. at 30.  The district court then rejected the contention that the \nIndicative Asylum Decision was “an adjudication on the merits.”  See id.  This was because \nit “prejudge[d] the outcome of the asylum proceeding” without providing Cristian the \n“ability . . . to provide any input into the process”—such as presenting evidence to refute \nthe Government’s assertions as to his ineligibility.  See id.     \nC. \nI see no abuse of discretion here.  The district court accurately articulated why the \nGovernment’s  argument  was—and  remains—unconvincing:  “Cristian  is  not  here  to \nreceive the process only because the Government removed him.  T[he] . . . order required \nCristian to be returned to this country[] to get the process” the Settlement Agreement \nguaranteed him.  See id. at 31 (emphasis added).  The Indicative Asylum Decision does not \nchange this.  It was not an “adjudicat[ion] on the merits” or a “Final Determination” as \nthose terms are defined in the Settlement Agreement.  See J.O.P., PACER 199-2 at 4–5 \n(defining “Final Determination” to require an “adjudication on the merits” and defining \n“Adjudicate on the merits” to require a “decision on the substance of an asylum claim”); \nReply Br. at 10 (now admitting—contrary to the assertion put forth in the Government’s \nRule 60(b)(5) motion—that the Indicative Asylum Decision is not an adjudication on the \nmerits).   \nFurther, as Cristian argues, the Indicative Asylum Decision—created five days after \nthe district court’s facilitation order was issued—was not an authentic change in factual \ncircumstances.  Cristian contends that neither “USCIS regulation, policy, [n]or practice” \n18 \n \n\nprovides for “Indicative Asylum Decisions.”  Resp. Br. at 21 (“[S]uch a practice appears \nnowhere in the agency’s 271-page procedural manual . . . .”).  Cristian concludes that the \nIndicative Asylum Decision is a “litigation-driven” document—a “contrivance” “created \njust for this case.”  Id.  The Government has no response to this charge—a deafening \nsilence.  See generally Reply Br.  \nIn sum, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Government’s \nRule 60(b)(5) motion. \n \nV. \n“[W]e fully respect the Executive’s robust  assertion  of its Article II powers.”  \nAbrego Garcia III, 2025 WL 1135112, at *1.  And we will continue to give “due regard \nfor the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs.”  Id. \n(quoting Abrego Garcia II, 145 S. Ct. at 1018).  Nothing here is meant to pass judgement \non whether Cristian is entitled to asylum—that question is beside the point.  Rather, the \nSettlement Agreement guaranteed Cristian an adjudication of his asylum application on the \nmerits—something his summary removal deprived him of.   \n“Both the Executive and the Judiciary have an obligation to follow the law.”  \nA.A.R.P. v. Trump, 145 S. Ct. 1034, 1036 (2025) (Alito, J., dissenting).  And our obligation \nto “say what the law is” forces us to intervene.  See Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, \n177 (1803).  The task is delicate but cannot be shirked, for our “Nation’s system of laws is \ndesigned to prevent, not enable,” a degradation of effective judicial review.  Trump v. \nJ.G.G., 145 S. Ct. 1003, 1011 (2025) (Sotomayor, J., dissenting); cf. Comm. for Nuclear \n19 \n \n\nResp., Inc. v. Seaborg, 463 F.2d 788, 793 (D.C. Cir. 1971) (“An essential ingredient of our \nrule of law is the authority of the courts to determine whether an executive official or \nagency has complied with the Constitution and with the mandates of Congress which define \nand limit the authority of the executive.  Any claim to executive absolutism cannot override \nthe duty of the court to assure that an official has not exceeded his charter or flouted the \nlegislative will.”).  \nWith that said, and for the reasons discussed above, I vote to deny the motion to \nstay pending appeal.   \n20 \n \n\nGREGORY, Circuit Judge, concurring: \nIt is telling that the dissent makes no effort to justify the President’s invocation of \nthe Alien Enemies Act (“AEA”).  While our colleague attempts to frame this as a mere \n“contract case,” Diss. Op. at 27, this is not so.  The equities question before us is whether \nthe judiciary is powerless to enforce a clear, binding contract because questions of foreign \npolicy are afoot.  This equitable balancing necessitates an analysis of the Executive’s \njustifications for breaching said contract; no valid reason is apparent from any of the \nbriefing or writings in this matter. \nThe President’s ipse dixit declaration that the nation of Venezuela, albeit through \nTren de Aragua (“TdA”) as a proxy, has engaged in an “invasion” or “predatory incursion” \nagainst territory of the United States is unsupportable.  Even worse, the government’s \nargument in this case is that this plainly invalid invocation of the Act can be used to void \nany and all contractual obligations of the federal government.  That cannot be––and is not–\n–the rule of law. \nTo begin, the AEA has been invoked sparingly and only during wartime.  The AEA \nwas enacted by the Fifth Congress in 1798 during the Quasi-War, fearing a military \ninvasion by France.  See J.G.G. v. Trump, No. 25-5067, 2025 WL 914682, at *9 (D.C. Cir. \nMar. 26, 2025) (Henderson, J., concurring); id. at *15 (Millett, J., concurring); Act of July \n6, 1798, ch. 66, 1 Stat. 577.  The Act “confers on the president very great discretionary \npowers  respecting  [alien  enemies],”  Ludecke  v.  Watkins,  335  U.S.  160,  164  (1948), \nallowing  him  to  detain  or  deport  anyone  from  the  proclaimed  “hostile  nation  or \ngovernment,” 50 U.S.C. § 21.  But this otherwise “near-blanket authority” has a “central \n21 \n \n\nlimit,” requiring that the United States be at war or under invasion or predatory incursion.  \nJ.G.G., 2025 WL 914682, at *2 (Henderson, J., concurring). \nBefore now, the AEA has been invoked only three times during our nation’s history: \nthe War of 1812, World War I, and World War II.  See Lockington v. Smith, 15 F. Cas. 758, \n758-759 (C.C.D. Pa. 1817) (discussing the War of 1812 proclamation); Proclamation, 40 \nStat. 1651 (1917) (World War I); Proclamation: Alien Enemies–Japanese, 6 Fed. Reg. \n6,321 (Dec. 10, 1941) (World War II).  The last of these began the day after the attack on \nPearl Harbor in 1941 and was used as the legal mechanism for Japanese internment.*  See \n6 Fed. Reg. 6321.  In each of these three instances, judicial review was available to \nnoncitizens removed or detained, as required by the AEA.  See Stephen I. Vladeck, Enemy \nAliens, Enemy Property, and Access to the Courts, 11 Lewis & Clark L. Rev. 963, 967–77 \n(2007).  The Act provides that when a “complaint against” an “alien enemy resident” is \npresented to a court  of the United States,  it is the court’s “duty” to provide “a full \nexamination and hearing on such complaint” and decide whether there is “sufficient cause” \nto have that person removed or otherwise detained.  50 U.S.C. § 23. \nNow, for only the fourth time, President Donald Trump has invoked the AEA, and \nwithout affording the required process.  On March 14, 2025, President Trump signed a \n \n*  I  would  be  remiss  not  to  note  that  this  internment  was  later  deemed \nunconstitutional.  See Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U.S. 667, 710 (2018).  The Supreme Court \nexplained that “[t]he forcible relocation of U.S. citizens to concentration camps, solely and \nexplicitly on the basis of race, is objectively unlawful and outside the scope of Presidential \nauthority.”  Id.  The Court continued that “Korematsu was gravely wrong the day it was \ndecided, has been overruled in the court of history, and—to be clear— has no place in law \nunder the Constitution.”  Id. (quotation and citation omitted). \n22 \n \n\nProclamation invoking his authority under the AEA to apprehend, detain, and remove “all \nVenezuelan citizens 14 years of age or older who are members of [Tren de Aragua]” and \nwho are not “naturalized or lawful permanent residents of the United States.”  Invocation \nof the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren de Aragua, \n90 Fed. Reg. 13,033 (Mar. 14, 2025). \nRelevant to this case, the invocation of the AEA is being used for an entirely new \npurpose: to set aside contractual obligations of the United States.  The dissent makes a \nmountain of the political interests that justify doing so, but it makes no effort to defend the \nPresident’s invocation of the Act.  I have severe difficulty in accepting that the invocation \nof the AEA can justify the voiding of all contractual obligations of the United States, \nparticularly without any analysis of the legality of that invocation.  Thus, I explain briefly \nwhy the President’s invocation of the Act plainly violates its terms.   \nAs mentioned above, the AEA’s conditional clause requires (i) “a declared war \nbetween the United States and any foreign nation or government, or” (ii) an “invasion or \npredatory incursion [ ] perpetrated, attempted, or threatened against the territory of the \nUnited  States by  any  foreign  nation or  government,”  and  (iii)  a  presidential  “public \nproclamation of the event.”  50 U.S.C. § 21.  President Trump has made his proclamation, \nbut no one asserts that there is a declared war.  Thus, the question becomes whether there \nis an invasion or predatory “incursion . . . by any foreign nation or government.” \nWe need not wade into the thicket of political questions surrounding whether the \nMaduro regime truly directs the activities of TdA, relevant to whether the supposed \ninvasion is attributable to a “foreign nation or government.” That is because, as nearly \n23 \n \n\nevery court to have reached the question has concluded, TdA’s actions cannot constitute \nan invasion or predatory incursion within the ordinary meaning of the AEA’s text.  As a \nsister circuit so thoroughly explained, dictionary definitions, statutory context, and history \nreveal that “an invasion is a military affair, not one of migration.”  J.G.G., 2025 WL \n914682, at *8–10 (Henderson, J., concurring).  As for “predatory incursion,” text and \nhistory again show that the term “referred to a form of hostilities against the United States \nby another nation-state, a form of attack short of war. Migration alone did not suffice.”  \nJ.G.G., 2025 WL 914682, at *10; see also J.A.V. v. Trump, --- F. Supp. 3d ---, 2025 WL \n1257450, at *15–16 (S.D. Tex. May 1, 2025) (discussing historical records to support idea \nthat “invasion” and “predatory incursion” refer to an attack by military forces); D.B.U. v. \nTrump, --- F.Supp. 3d ---,  2025 WL 1304288, at *6 (D. Col. 2025) (relying on “Founding-\nera definitions and historical sources” to conclude the same).  I agree that “invasion” and \n“predatory incursion” require some type of military attack, evidence for which was present \nin all previous instances where the AEA was invoked.  \n  Turning to the text of President Trump’s recent Proclamation, I see no evidence of \nany kind to suggest any “invasion” or “predatory incursion” is afoot.  The President cannot, \nby fiat, declare legal conclusions of whether there is or is not an invasion without providing \nunderlying supportive facts.  See Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 214 (1962) (even in \nemergency circumstances prompting political questions, a “court is not at liberty to shut its \neyes to an obvious mistake”); United States v. Abbott, 110 F.4th 700, 736 (5th Cir. 2024) \n(“To be sure, a state of invasion under Article I, section 10 does not exist just because a \nState official has uttered certain magic words.”) (Ho, J., concurring).  Without broader facts \n24 \n \n\nexplaining that an invasion or incursion is underway, courts are powerless to exercise our \nnecessary role in reviewing executive action.  See, e.g., Comm. for Nuclear Resp., Inc. v. \nSeaborg, 463 F.2d 788, 793 (D.C. Cir. 1971) (“An essential ingredient of our rule of law \nis the authority of the courts to determine whether an executive official or agency has \ncomplied with the Constitution and with the mandates of Congress which define and limit \nthe authority of the executive.”); Boumediene v. Bush, 553 U.S. 723, 783 (2008) (even in \nthe most dire circumstances, courts “must have sufficient authority to conduct a meaningful \nreview of both the cause for detention and the Executive’s power to detain”).  Even \nassuming the truth of any factual aspects of the Proclamation, there are no underlying facts \nthat suggest a military attack by or on behalf of the nation of Venezuela.  TdA is a brutal \ncriminal organization, but there is nothing aside from the President’s unsupported assertion \nthat suggests any military action within the meaning of the AEA.  Thus, I would find that \nthe AEA was illegally invoked in this case.  \n  Now,  we  are  left  with  this  troubling  situation:  an  unjustified  Presidential \nproclamation being used to justify voiding the United States’ contractual obligations.  Our \ncourts  have  always  endorsed  the  fundamental  public  interest  in  the  enforcement  of \nsettlement agreements and contractual rights.  See, e.g., Evans v. Jeff D., 475 U.S. 717, \n732-33 (1986).  Yet, it appears our colleague is willing to throw these principles to the \nwind.  I cannot––and will not––join in this departure from established norms.  \nAs is becoming far too common, we are confronted again with the efforts of the \nExecutive Branch to set aside the rule of law in pursuit of its goals.  It is the duty of courts \nto  stand  as  a  bulwark  against  the  political  tides  that  seek  to  override  constitutional \n25 \n \n\nprotections and fundamental principles of law, even in the name of noble ends like public \nsafety.  The district court faithfully applied the contractual provisions in dispute here, and \nit properly ordered the United States to remedy the violation of its explicit promises.  I \ncannot more fully concur in the denial of the stay pending appeal in this matter. \n26 \n \n\n \nRICHARDSON, Circuit Judge, dissenting: \nThis “dissent makes no effort to justify the President’s invocation of the Alien \nEnemies Act.”  Supra at 21 (Gregory, J., concurring).  For this case does not present any \nquestions  about  the  lawfulness  of  that  proclamation  or  the  process  due  to  those \nremoved under it. \nInstead, this is a contract case.  Appellee, a Venezuelan national proceeding under \nthe  pseudonym  “Cristian,”  was  part  of  a  class-wide  settlement  agreement  with  the \ngovernment that it would not execute any “final removal order” he might receive without \nfirst adjudicating his asylum application.  Without concluding removal proceedings or \nissuing a final order of removal, the government sent him to El Salvador under the Alien \nEnemies proclamation.  Cristian’s sole claim is that this breached the agreement. \nTo resolve that legally ordinary claim, the district court imposed a novel injunction.  \nAlthough in my view Cristian did not show a breach of the agreement, Paragraph 2 of the \ndistrict court’s order requires the government to “facilitate” his return, and expands upon \nthat verb to “include[] . . . a good faith request by Defendants to the government of El \nSalvador to release Cristian to U.S. custody for transport back to the United States.” \nAs I see it, that is not what the district court, this Court, or the Supreme Court \napproved in Abrego Garcia.  Many options may be available to district courts seeking to \ncraft appropriate relief in response to deportations they find unlawful.  But directing \ndiplomatic negotiations to the Executive Branch is not among them. \nI would stay Paragraph 2 of the district court’s order.  Because the panel does not, \nI respectfully dissent. \n27 \n \n\n \nI \n  As Judge Benjamin observes, this case did not begin with the President’s Alien \nEnemies proclamation—or any of this administration’s acts.  It began instead six years ago \nas a challenge to a USCIS policy statement that adjusted the procedure by which the agency \nwould consider certain asylum applications. \nA \n  Normally, asylum applications by those in removal proceedings are decided by \nimmigration judges.  See 8 C.F.R. §§ 208.2(b), 1208.2(b).  But by statute, USCIS has \njurisdiction over asylum applications by “unaccompanied alien children,” a term of art \nreferring to minors without lawful immigration status who do not have parents or guardians \nto support them.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(3)(C) (conferring jurisdiction); 6 U.S.C. § 279(g) \n(defining “unaccompanied alien child”).  Until 2013, USCIS would check whether an \nasylum applicant was a UAC to determine if it had jurisdiction to decide the application.  \nIn 2013, the agency shifted gears and began accepting any determination by another agency \nthat an applicant was a UAC “without another factual inquiry.”  Memorandum from Ted \nKim, Acting Chief, Asylum Div. 2 (May 28, 2013).  Then in 2019, USCIS reversed course \nand  again  began  making  “independent  factual  inquiries.”    Memorandum  from  John \nLafferty, Chief, Asylum Div. 2 (May 31, 2019). \n  In response to this return to the old policy, plaintiffs sued.  They complained on \nbehalf of a putative class that the 2019 reversion violated the Administrative Procedure Act \nand the Due Process Clause.  After granting a TRO, the district court certified the class, \nand the parties negotiated a settlement agreement in 2024.  That agreement covers the class: \n28 \n \n\n \n“all individuals nationwide who [before the 2019 reversion] (1) were determined to be a \nUAC; and (2) who filed an asylum application that was pending with USCIS; and (3) on \nthe date they filed . . . were 18 years of age or older, or had a parent or legal guardian in \nthe United States . . . and (4) for whom USCIS has not adjudicated the individual’s asylum \napplication on the merits.”  J.O.P. v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., No. 8:19-cv-09144 (D. \nMd. July 30, 2024), ECF 199-2 at 4.1  Relevant to the lawsuit’s initial aim, the 2024 \nagreement requires USCIS to make new rules and to accept jurisdiction over, then decide, \nthe class members’ applications.  See id. at 6.  And relevant here, it provides that “[w]ith \nrespect to any Class Member with a final removal order, ICE will refrain from executing \nthe Class Member’s final removal order until USCIS issues a Final Determination on one \nproperly filed asylum application under the terms of this Agreement.”  Id. at 8.  In sum, the \nagreement provides that for class members with final removal orders, the government \ncannot execute those orders without first adjudicating their asylum claims on the merits. \n  The  agreement  also  contains  an  enforcement  mechanism.    It  requires  the \ngovernment to submit compliance reports and allows the class to reply.  See id. at 12–13.  \nAnd it establishes a procedure to resolve disputes.  Should one party believe the other to \nbe in breach, the parties must meet and confer to sort things out.  “If the dispute cannot be \nresolved, the complaining Class Member(s) may move to enforce the Agreement” as to \nthemselves, and “Class Counsel may elect to move to enforce the Agreement on an \n \n1 By including only persons who filed for asylum after turning 18 or uniting with \nparents or guardians in the United States, the class strictly excludes unaccompanied alien \nchildren.  So the settlement provides the protections afforded those who are unaccompanied \nalien children only to those who were wrongly determined at some time to qualify. \n29 \n \n\n \nindividual or class-wide basis.”  Id. at 13.  “Once such a motion to enforce is initiated, the \ncomplaining Class Member shall not be removed from the United States unless and until \nthe matter has been resolved in favor of Defendants.”  Id.  When it approved the settlement, \nthe district court also “directed” the parties “to implement and consummate the Agreement \naccording  to  [its]  terms”  and  retained  “jurisdiction  to  enforce  the  Agreement.”  \nECF 205 at 3. \nB \n  Cristian applied for asylum in 2022 when he was already 18.  In January 2025, that \napplication remained undecided.  But the government took Cristian into immigration \ncustody following his felony conviction for possessing cocaine.  The government then \nbegan removal proceedings, arguing that Cristian was inadmissible because he was present \nwithout having been admitted and because of his cocaine conviction. \n  While both asylum and removal proceedings pended, the President directed by \nproclamation  that  members  of  Tren  de  Aragua,  a  Venezuelan  crime  syndicate  and \ndesignated Foreign Terrorist Organization, be removed from the country under the Alien \nEnemies Act.  See Proclamation No. 10903, 90 Fed. Reg. 13033, 13034 (Mar. 14, 2025); \nsee also 50 U.S.C. § 21 et seq.  Soon after, Cristian was removed to El Salvador under that \nproclamation. \nClass counsel then contacted the government, arguing that Cristian was a class \nmember and that his removal breached the agreement.  The government confirmed that \nCristian had been removed to El Salvador but disagreed that this was a breach.  So class \n30 \n \n\n \ncounsel moved to enforce the agreement, seeking an order that “Defendants shall promptly \nreturn Cristian to the United States.”  ECF 227-4. \nThe district court obliged.  Despite finding no facts about where Cristian was, \nwhether he was confined, or under whose authority; despite no sound argument from \nCristian that his removal “execut[ed]” a “final removal order” that he never had, ECF 199-\n2 at 8; and despite the Supreme Court’s recent admonition about “the deference owed to \nthe Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs,” Noem v. Abrego Garcia, 145 S. \nCt. 1017, 1018 (2025), the district court entered a novel injunction.  Under Paragraph 2 of \nits order, the government must “facilitate Class Member Cristian’s return to the United \nStates”—and  “[f]acilitation  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to,  a  good  faith  request  by \nDefendants to the government of El Salvador to release Cristian to U.S. custody for \ntransport back to the United States.”  ECF 254 at 2.  Simply put, the district court ordered \nthe Executive Branch to engage in diplomatic negotiations with a foreign power. \nII \nThis injunction finds no support in precedent or the facts.  Though I understand the \ndistrict court’s unease with the Executive’s recent conduct, its remedy does not fit this case.  \nCristian presents a contract claim, not a quarrel with the Alien Enemies proclamation.  Yet \nin resolving the contract dispute, the district court entangled the judiciary in the roil of \nforeign affairs.  And it did so based on a claim that does not work:  Cristian’s case is \ndifficult to reconcile with the agreement’s text and does not warrant injunctive relief \nbecause even winning all he seeks would give Cristian little prospect of real-world benefit. \n31 \n \n\n \nA \n“The President is the sole organ of the nation in its external relations, and its sole \nrepresentative with foreign nations.”  10 Annals of Cong. 613 (1800) (statement of Rep. \nJohn Marshall).  His power to speak for the country “in the field of international relations” \nis both “plenary and exclusive.”  United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U.S. \n304, 319 (1936).  This does not mean only the President can make foreign policy.  Congress \nmust ratify treaties, confirm ambassadors, regulate foreign commerce, and declare war.  \nU.S. Const. art. II, § 2; art. I, § 8.  In this sense, some “[p]residential powers . . . depend[] \nupon their disjunction or conjunction with those of Congress.”  Youngstown Sheet & Tube \nCo. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring).2 \nBut when it comes to negotiating with foreign states, precedent is clear:  “The \nPresident has the sole power to negotiate treaties.”  Zivotofsky ex rel. Zivotofsky v. Kerry, \n576 U.S. 1,  13 (2015); see also Curtiss-Wright, 299 U.S. at 319 (“Into the field of \nnegotiation the Senate cannot intrude; and Congress itself is powerless to invade it.”).  This \npower to negotiate, in my view, reaches more than official-channel communiques that \nresult in formal agreements.  Diplomacy takes place in a wide array of fora, through many \nactors within the Executive Branch.  See Zivotofsky, 576 U.S. at 13–14.  Yet seldom will \neither  nation know  whether  diplomatic  discussions  will result  in  a  treaty  until  those \n \n2 Reasonable people disagree about just how much the content of foreign policy \ndepends on Congress.  The Founding generation certainly did.  Compare 7 The Works of \nAlexander Hamilton 76–117 (John C. Hamilton ed., 1851), with The Federalist No. 75, at \n505–06 (Hamilton) (Jacob E. Cooke ed., 1961), and 6 The Writings of James Madison 138–\n88 (Gaillard Hunt ed., 1906); see also 10 The Writings of Thomas Jefferson 410–11 (Albert \nEllery Bergh ed., 1907) (taking a middle position). \n32 \n \n\n \ndiscussions are well underway.  There is no such thing as a trifling discussion between \nheads of state; matters perceived as unimportant in the moment may unexpectedly bloom \ninto trade pacts and environmental protocols—or deteriorate into war.  As a practical \nreality, then, the power to negotiate treaties with foreign states is just the power to negotiate \nwith foreign states. \nDespite  disagreements  about  the  President’s  foreign-affairs  power  generally, \nscholars of all stripes have affirmed this narrower principle that the President retains \n“dominance over diplomatic communications.”  Harold H. Koh, The National Security \nConstitution 81 (1990); see also Edward S. Corwin, The President 184 (4th ed. 1957) \n(“[T]here is no more securely established principle of constitutional practice than the \nexclusive right of the President to be the nation’s intermediary in its dealing with other \nnations.” (emphasis and citation omitted)). \nAnd indeed, some advocates of the Constitution argued that this was the whole point \nof placing treaty-making power with the Executive.  Some thought that “negotiations \nbetween nations” required discretion and purposefulness that “numerous bodies” could not \neasily replicate.  4 Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal \nConstitution 119–20 (Jonathan Elliot ed., William S. Hein & Co. 2d ed. 1996) (1891) \n(statement of William Davie); see also 4 id. at 269 (statement of John Pringle) (similar); \nThe Federalist No. 72, supra, at 486 (Hamilton) (explaining that “[t]he actual conduct of \nforeign negotiations” “falls peculiarly within the province of the executive department”).  \nOthers advanced efficiency rationales.  Hamilton opined that Congress would have too \nlittle time to legislate unless “the management of foreign negotiations” were assigned to \n33 \n \n\n \nsomeone else.  The Federalist No. 84, supra, at 585–86.  Given these views, it is little \nsurprise that the Constitution gave Congress “no constitutional power that would enable it \nto initiate diplomatic relations with a foreign nation.” Zivotofsky, 576 U.S. at 14. \nThe “consequence” of this constitutional structure is twofold:  “[T]he demand of a \nforeign nation can only be made on [the President],” and it is the President who holds “the \npower of demanding a . . . performance” from a foreign government.  10 Annals of Cong., \nsupra, at 613–14.  “[I]t is still the Legislative Branch, not the Executive Branch, that makes \nthe law.”  Zivotofsky, 576 U.S. at 21.  But only the President has the power to speak.  Id. \nThe  judiciary  plays  a  limited  role  in  this  scheme.    The  Constitution  “grants \nsubstantive authority in foreign affairs both to Congress in Article I and to the Executive \nin  Article  II.    No  such  substantive  power  is  granted  to  the  Judiciary.”  \nAbrego Garcia v. Noem, No. 25-1345, 2025 WL 1021113, at *7 (4th Cir. Apr. 7, 2025) \n(Wilkinson, J., concurring).  If either the first or second branch exceeds its constitutional \nrole, we can say so—and must, when a case requires it.  But the Constitution does not place \nthe President’s power to speak to a foreign state under the direction of the courts.  As \nJustice Jackson once wrote for the Court, \n[T]he very nature of executive decisions as to foreign policy is political, not \njudicial.  Such decisions are wholly confided by our Constitution to the \npolitical  departments  of  the  government,  Executive  and  Legislative. . . .  \nThey are decisions of a kind for which the Judiciary has neither aptitude, \nfacilities nor responsibility and which has long been held to belong in the \ndomain of political power not subject to judicial intrusion or inquiry. \n \nChicago & S. Air Lines v. Waterman S.S. Corp., 333 U.S. 103, 111 (1948).  Following this \nreasoning, the Court has consistently rebuffed invitations to micromanage the Executive’s \n34 \n \n\n \ndiplomatic and national-security activities.  See, e.g., Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U.S. 667, 704 \n(2018); Jama v. Immigr. & Customs Enf’t, 543 U.S. 335, 348 (2005); Martin v. Mott, \n25 U.S. 19, 30 (1827). \nI do not mean to suggest that this case presents only (or any) political questions \nbeyond the cognizance of the judiciary.  But the power to decide a case is not the power to \nimpose just any remedy.  Foreign diplomacy is entrusted to “the President alone.”  Curtiss-\nWright, 299 U.S. at 319.  And “being entrusted to the executive, the decision of the \nexecutive is conclusive.”  Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 166 (1803). \nCristian’s briefing all but concedes this.  He argues at length that his situation \njustifies doing something to help him return.  But Cristian does not mention—much less \ndefend—the part of the district court’s order that expands upon “facilitate” to “include[] . . . \na good faith request by Defendants to the government of El Salvador to release Cristian to \nU.S. custody for transport back to the United States.”  ECF 254 at 2.  Instead, he insists \nwithout explaining that the injunction is “virtually identical” to the order the Supreme \nCourt approved in Abrego Garcia.  Opposition at 21.  It is not.  Recall, the district court in \nAbrego Garcia ordered the government “to facilitate and effectuate the return of” Abrego \nGarcia.  Abrego Garcia v. Noem, No. 8:25-cv-00951, ECF 21 (D. Md. Apr. 4, 2025).  \nUnlike the district court here, it did not expand upon what it means to “facilitate.”  And \ngiven the other word, “effectuate,” it is hard to imagine that the Abrego Garcia district \ncourt had such a broad meaning in mind. \nJudge Benjamin, too, treats this order like the one the Court approved in Abrego \nGarcia.  Unlike Cristian, she does not reach this conclusion by ignoring the district court’s \n35 \n \n\n \nexpansion of “facilitate.”  Instead, Judge Benjamin insists that diplomacy is just what \n“facilitate” means.  With respect for my good colleague, I do not agree.  On the first appeal \nto this Court in Abrego Garcia, Judge Wilkinson construed that order to require facilitation \nonly—rejecting the stronger verb for fear that it would “breach[] the sovereignty of another \nnation” and “intru[de] into what rightly are executive diplomatic powers.”  Abrego Garcia, \n2025 WL 1021113, at *8 (Wilkinson, J., concurring).  And even the facilitation order, he \nmaintained, “must afford [the Executive Branch] latitude as to how the facilitation [could] \nbest be accomplished.”  Id. \nThe Supreme Court seemingly agreed with Judge Wilkinson.  It held that “facilitate” \nwas  “proper[]”  but  that  “‘effectuate’ . . .  may  exceed  the  District  Court’s  authority.”  \nAbrego Garcia, 145 S. Ct. at 1018.  As Justice Sotomayor pointed out, “facilitate” is a well-\nknown  term  among  immigration-related  agencies.    See  id.  at  1019  (Sotomayor,  J., \nrespecting the Court’s disposition).  The policy document Justice Sotomayor relied on \ndefines that term this way: \nTo engage in activities which allow a lawfully removed alien to return to the \nUnited States (such as by issuing a Boarding Letter to permit commercial air \ntravel) and, if warranted, parole the alien into the United States upon his or \nher arrival at a U.S. port of entry.  Facilitating an alien’s return does not \nnecessarily include funding the alien’s travel via commercial carrier to the \nUnited States or making flight arrangements for the alien. \n \nU.S. Immigr. & Customs Enf’t, Directive 11061.1, Facilitating the Return to the United \nStates of Certain Lawfully Removed Aliens § 3.1 (2012).  Needless to say, none of these \nactivities  resembles  court-commanded  negotiation  with  a  foreign  state.    Given  this \n36 \n \n\n \nestablished usage and the Court’s apparent accord, I would not read the Court’s order to \ngive “facilitate” so much breadth.3 \nIn an appropriate case, then, a district court may “properly require[] the Government \nto ‘facilitate’ [someone’s] release from custody in El Salvador.”  Abrego Garcia, 145 S. \nCt. at 1018.  And as a panel of this Court explained on remand in Abrego Garcia, that is \nnot a toothless remedy:  “Facilitate” is an “active verb” that “does not . . . allow the \ngovernment to do essentially nothing.”  Abrego Garcia v. Noem, 2025 WL 1135112, at *1 \n(4th Cir. Apr. 17, 2025).  It may cover more than “remov[ing] . . . domestic barriers.”  Id. \n(emphasis deleted).  We do not yet know just how far “facilitate” may legitimately reach. \nBut however far “facilitate” goes, it cannot encompass an order requiring specific \ndiplomatic communication from the Executive Branch.  So far as I can tell, no district court \nhas ever done such a thing.  And when district courts have tried to enjoin the Executive’s \nforeign-affairs conduct, they have been met with swift rebuke.  See, e.g., Holtzman v. \nSchlesinger,  414 U.S.  1304,  1315  (1973)  (Marshall,  J.,  in  chambers)  (“[T]he  proper \nresponse to an arguably illegal action is not lawlessness by judges.”). \nThe district court did not have to take that road here.  It had options short of ordering \nthe Executive to contact a foreign government and request Cristian’s release.  As evidence, \njust consider the district-court proceedings on remand in Abrego Garcia itself.  The court \n \n3 My colleague emphasizes the requirement that the government generally act in \n“good faith.”  Supra at 14 (Benjamin, J., concurring) (quoting ECF 254 at 2).  In isolation, \nI agree that the Government should act in good faith.  But my concern is the specific act \nthat good faith modifies: “request by Defendants to the government of El Salvador to \nrelease Cristian to U.S. custody.” \n37 \n \n\n \n(and the parties) have spent weeks toiling on detailed discovery so that the court can \nidentify an appropriate remedy with the benefit of full information—all to fulfill the \nSupreme Court’s mandate to “clarify” the court’s order and give “due regard for the \ndeference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs.”  Abrego Garcia, \n145 S. Ct. at 1018.  Troubled as it may have been by the President’s actions here, this \ndistrict court should not have intruded into the Executive’s prerogative without some \nsimilar process. \nB \n  Caution was particularly warranted here because Cristian’s claim is dubious on the \nmerits.  To start, consider what this case is not about.  Cristian has not challenged here the \nlegitimacy  of  the  President’s  Alien  Enemies  Act  proclamation.    He  has  not  sought \n“‘judicial review’ as to ‘questions of interpretation and constitutionality’ of the Act” or \nwhether he “is in fact an alien enemy.”  Trump v. J.G.G., 145 S. Ct. 1003, 1006 (2025) \n(quoting Ludecke v. Watkins, 335 U.S. 160, 163, 172 & n.17 (1948)).  Nor has he claimed \nthat the circumstances of his removal raise due process problems.  See id. (citing Reno v. \nFlores, 507 U.S. 292, 306 (1993)).  Instead, he argues only that his removal breached a \nsettlement agreement. \n  That agreement has nothing to say about his removal under these circumstances.  \nWe can presume that Cristian is a member of the settlement class.  But the agreement does \nnot give class members a general right not to be removed from the country.  Instead, it \nprovides that for any class member who has a “final removal order, ICE will refrain from \nexecuting the Class Member’s final removal order.”  ECF 199-2 at 8. \n38 \n \n\n \nThis phrase carries a narrow, specialized meaning.  “[I]n the deportation context, a \n‘final order of removal’ is a final order ‘concluding that the alien is deportable or ordering \ndeportation.’”    Nasrallah  v.  Barr,  590  U.S.  573,  579  (2020)  (quoting  8  U.S.C. \n§ 1101(a)(47)(A)).  In fact, the section of the Immigration and Nationality Act on which \nNasrallah relies created the term by express definition.  And by limiting the term to apply \n“in this chapter”—a chapter containing all and only the major immigration provisions in \nTitle 8—the statute makes clear that “final order of removal” is a creature of Title 8.  \n8 U.S.C. § 1101(a). \nThe Supreme Court and this one thus recognize that “final order of removal” is a \nterm of art.  It is not a generic reference to just any order under which someone might be \nremoved; it specifically refers to the product of removal proceedings conducted according \nto Title 8.  See, e.g., Monsalvo Velázquez v. Bondi, 145 S. Ct. 1232, 1239–40 (2025).  And \nas  Nasrallah  says,  a  “final  order  of  removal”  need  not  conclusively  authorize  the \ngovernment to remove someone from the country.  Often, such an order only settles \n“removability”  but  may  not  result  in  actual  removal  because  withholding  or  other \nproceedings are ongoing.  Salgado v. Garland, 69 F.4th 179, 181–82 (4th Cir. 2023) \n(emphasis omitted); see also Johnson v. Guzman Chavez, 594 U.S. 523, 539 (2021). \nRemoval orders under Title 8 are just one of many ways the government can compel \nan alien’s departure.  For instance, the government can extradite those wanted abroad.  See \n18 U.S.C. § 3181 et seq.  During the pandemic, it removed aliens under provisions in Title \n42.  See generally Huisha-Huisha v. Mayorkas, 27 F.4th 718 (D.C. Cir. 2022).  And even \nin a Title 8 proceeding, the government can grant voluntary departure “in lieu of removal.”  \n39 \n \n\n \nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a)(1), -(b)(1).  Given that the expulsion of aliens comes in many \nforms but “final order of removal” consistently refers to only one of them, it is implausible \nto read the settlement agreement’s use of the phrase to reach just any order under which \nsomeone is removed. \nThe agreement itself reinforces this distinction.  Once a class member has filed a \nmotion to enforce, the agreement does categorically provide that “the complaining Class \nMember shall not be removed from the United States.”  ECF 199-2 at 13.  Of course, if the \nearlier section already categorically forbade the government to remove class members, no \nmatter the procedure, this extra provision would be superfluous.  In the narrow situation \nwhere the parties have already begun to litigate the scope of the agreement, though, it \nmakes sense to automatically stay any removal.  But this affords no help to Cristian, who \nwas removed weeks before moving to enforce the agreement. \n  Judge Benjamin’s ordinary-meaning approach buckles under the weight of this \ncontext.  Of course, Judge Benjamin is right that by default, we read contracts as though \nthey speak ordinary language.  But contracts often use terms of art in addition to laymen’s \nterms—not least because without them, “[c]ontracts would become massive and unwieldy \ntreatises.”  Marquez v. Screen Actors Guild, Inc., 525 U.S. 33, 47 (1998).  Just as with \nstatutes, “the context of these words—the water in which they swim—indicates” whether \nthe parties “used them as terms of art.”  United States v. Hansen, 599 U.S. 762, 775 (2023).  \nAnd it is no surprise that sophisticated parties settling an important question in a field rife \nwith specialized language would use that language to make their agreement.  Cf. Corning \nGlass Works v. Brennan, 417 U.S. 188, 202 (1974) (“While a layman might assume that \n40 \n \n\n \ntime of day worked reflects one aspect of a job’s ‘working conditions,’ the term has a \ndifferent and much more specialized meaning in the language of industrial relations.”).  For \nthis term, settled usage and the rest of the agreement together leave little doubt that “final \nremoval order” refers to the product of Title 8 proceedings. \n  Even supposing “final removal order” reached beyond Title 8, fitting Cristian’s \nsituation  into  the  agreement  requires  a  second  premise:    that  “the  President’s  AEA \nProclamation” is a final removal order.  Opposition at 12.  But this too strains the text and \ncontext of the agreement.  The agreement does not talk about removal orders in the abstract; \nthe antiremoval provision says that it applies to “any Class Member with a final removal \norder.”  ECF 199-2 at 8 (emphasis added); see also id. (forbidding ICE to “execut[e] the \nClass Member’s final removal order” (emphasis added)).  So the orders contemplated by \nthe  agreement  are  specific  to  particular  class  members.    Of  course,  the  generalized \nproclamation is not.   \n* \nAt bottom, the district court imposed an injunction that exceeds its power.  And it \ndid so to remedy government action that did not breach the agreement—unlawful though \nit may have been in other ways.  Because the injunction goes too far, and the government’s \nsuccess on the merits is therefore all but assured, I would grant a stay.4 \n \n4 For its part, the government floats a more fundamental reason for us to suspend \nthe district court’s order.  In its view, that court lacked jurisdiction because “[c]hallenges \nto removal under the AEA . . . must be brought in habeas.”  J.G.G., 145 S. Ct. at 1005; see \nReply at 6 & n.2.  I have my doubts.  To begin, although the Court in J.G.G. quoted a case \nthat uses the word “jurisdiction,” context makes clear that its habeas-only holding sounded \n(Continued) \n41 \n \n\n \nIII \n  If any doubt remained, the equities confirm that this injunction must be stayed. \nA \n  To start, it is hard to see how this order could meaningfully benefit Cristian.  Since \nhis removal, USCIS has made clear that his asylum application has no chance of success.  \nAnd  even  if  Cristian  got  asylum,  he  would  remain  removable  anyway.    Those \ncircumstances make it hard to justify equitable relief—much less this equitable relief. \n \nin “venue.”  Id.  Rumsfeld v. Padilla does indeed say that “for core habeas petitions \nchallenging present physical confinement, jurisdiction lies in only one district:  the district \nof confinement.”  542 U.S. 426, 443 (2004).  But this strikes me as “a characterization left \nover from days when we were less than meticulous in our use of the term ‘jurisdictional.’”  \nHamer v. Neighborhood Housing Servs., 583 U.S. 17, 27 (2017) (quotation omitted).  And \nvenue, of course, can be waived—which scuttles the government’s late-breaking bid to \navoid the merits. \nPlus, whether construed as jurisdiction or venue, the government’s argument cannot \naccount for Abrego Garcia.  There, as in J.G.G., a plaintiff challenged his confinement and \nremoval under the AEA.  Abrego Garcia, 145 S. Ct. at 1018.  And like J.G.G., Abrego \nGarcia sought an injunction—not habeas.  If the federal courts had no jurisdiction to hear \nsuch claims, the Supreme Court’s Abrego Garcia opinion had no reason to opine on \nwhether the district court’s injunction breached Article II. \nJ.G.G.’s reliance on the Heck bar and its kin gives us another good reason to think \nit is not jurisdictional:  The Heck bar itself is not jurisdictional.  See, e.g., Brunson v. Stein, \n116 F.4th 301, 307 n.8 (4th Cir. 2024).  Like venue, it is a waivable defense.  It would be \nstrange to read J.G.G. as weaving a jurisdictional quilt from this nonjurisdictional fabric. \nWith  these  principles  in  mind,  it  becomes  apparent  that  despite  their  facial \nsimilarities, J.G.G.’s and Abrego Garcia’s claims are legally quite different.  The J.G.G. \nplaintiffs challenged their confinement by federal officers who planned to deport them.  \nProving that they could not be removed would “‘necessarily imply the invalidity’ of their \nconfinement,” so their claim triggered the Heck bar and they needed to use habeas.  J.G.G., \n145 S. Ct. at 1005 (quoting Nance v. Ward, 597 U.S. 159, 167 (2022)).  By contrast, Abrego \nGarcia sued only after he had left U.S. custody.  To the extent he challenged a confinement, \nit was not confinement by federal officers pending his removal but rather his postremoval \nconfinement in El Salvador.  Given this, he could seek an injunction requiring federal \nofficers to facilitate his return. \n42 \n \n\n \nFederal courts wielding the equity powers conferred by Article III and the first \nJudiciary  Act may  not “restrain  an  act”  that  does  not  threaten  substantial  “injurious \nconsequences.”    Weinberger  v.  Romero-Barcelo,  456  U.S.  305,  311  (1982)  (quoting \nConsol. Canal Co. v. Mesa Canal Co., 177 U.S. 296, 302 (1900)).  “An injunction should \nissue only where the intervention of a court of equity is essential,” which means that \nwithout an injunction the claimant will sustain “irreparable injury.”  Id. at 312 (quotation \nomitted).  For this reason, an injunction may not sweep more broadly than necessary to \nstave off that injury.  See, e.g., Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms, 561 U.S. 139, 160–\n61 (2010); Madsen v. Women’s Health Ctr., Inc., 512 U.S. 753, 765 (1994); Califano v. \nYamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702 (1979). \n  Cristian’s claim and the district court’s order fail this standard twice over.  First, \nCristian seemingly cannot get asylum.  The evidence appears uncontroverted that he is a \nmember of Tren de Aragua.  Tren de Aragua is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization.  \nAnd membership in a Foreign Terrorist Organization is a categorical bar to asylum.  \n8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(2)(A)(v) (authority to grant asylum “shall not apply” to a knowing \nmember of a terrorist organization—someone falling within subclause (VI) of section \n1182(a)(3)(B)(i)).  Reflecting this obligation to deny asylum to members of terrorist \ngroups, USCIS has indicated that Cristian’s “application for asylum would be denied.”  \nMotion at 2.  True, Cristian’s theory is not just that he cannot get asylum without returning \nto the country but that returning would give him a chance to participate in the asylum-\napplication process.  Yet asylum is a matter of grace, not right; it is up to the Executive \nBranch’s “discretion.”  INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 423 (1987); see also \n43 \n \n\n \n8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(A) (providing that the Executive “may grant asylum”).  And here, \n“the asylum decision has already been made,” which means “those procedures would be \nfutile.”  Huisha-Huisha, 27 F.4th at 731.5 \n  Cristian replies that he could contest this mandatory bar in an asylum interview by \noffering evidence that he is not associated with Tren de Aragua.  Maybe so.  But he gives \nus no reason to think that he has persuasive arguments or evidence that would likely change \nthe result.  The government’s evidence that Cristian belongs to Tren de Aragua is no doubt \nsubstantial enough to withstand judicial review of the agency’s decision.  And even if it \nwere not, “the Attorney General’s discretionary judgment whether to grant [asylum] shall \nbe conclusive unless manifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.”  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(b)(4).  USCIS has indicated that alongside the mandatory terrorism bar, it would \ndeny Cristian asylum as a matter of its discretion because of his criminal record—a record \nthat he does not dispute. \n  Second, even were Cristian to receive asylum, that status would not shield him from \nremoval.  Just as membership in a terrorist organization presents a categorical bar to \nasylum, it is a ground for revoking asylum already granted.  Id. § 1158(c)(2), -(b)(2)(v).  \nGiven this, there would be little point returning Cristian to the United States to adjudicate \n \n5 Judge Benjamin objects that the indicative asylum decision is a “‘litigation-driven’ \ndocument,” “not an authentic change in factual circumstances.”  Supra at 19 (quoting Reply \nat 21).  But whatever weight we give what USCIS has said so far, it is also true that based \non the evidence before us, Cristian is apparently ineligible for asylum.  And if so, USCIS \nhas no choice but to do what it has told us it intends to do. \n44 \n \n\n \na doomed request for executive grace—and certainly no prospect of real-world benefit \nsolid enough to support the district court’s tall order.6 \nTo be sure, Cristian is correct that we sometimes enforce procedural rights for their \nown sake, independent of the substantive benefits that may follow.  At the same time, the \nfederal courts will not normally remedy the “deprivation of a procedural right without some \nconcrete interest that is affected by the deprivation.”  Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 \nU.S. 488, 496 (2009).  The procedure must be tethered to some substance, however thin.  \nAnd in equity, which does not take litigants’ representations for granted the way standing \ndoes, the question posed to the district court’s discretion is not just whether a defendant \nhas broken the law but whether the remedy proposed is necessary to prevent real-world \nharm.  Without a reason to think more process would change USCIS’s mind, Cristian’s \nasylum-process claim does not justify resort to equity—much less equity that directs the \nExecutive’s diplomatic communications. \n \n6 The Alien Enemies Act may permit removal without revoking asylum.  The asylum \nstatute  provides  that  once  someone  has  asylum,  unless  it  is  revoked,  “the  Attorney \nGeneral . . . shall not remove or return the alien to the alien’s country of nationality or, in \nthe  case  of  a  person  having  no  nationality,  the  country  of  the  alien’s  last  habitual \nresidence.”  8 U.S.C. § 1158(c)(1).  But the Alien Enemies Act provides that “all” alien \nenemies “who shall be within the United States and not actually naturalized, shall be liable \nto be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed.”  50 U.S.C. § 21 (emphasis added).  \nBy its text, then, the Alien Enemies Act applies to alien enemies who have received asylum.  \nWhether the asylum statute supersedes this sweeping language is unsettled.  But the asylum \nstatute’s  seemingly  categorical  language—“shall  not  remove”—may  preclude  only \nremoval under Title 8, not removal generally.  See, e.g., Castaneda-Castillo v. Holder, 638 \nF.3d 354, 360–61 (1st Cir. 2011) (observing that so long as the relevant extradition treaty \nis “silen[t] on the issue, the Secretary of State may, in her discretion, order the extradition \nof an individual . . . even if that individual is granted asylum”). \n \n45 \n \n\n \nIn turn, without a plausible claim to asylum, Cristian does not assert an injury that \nshifts the equities in his favor.  The Supreme Court has told us that “the burden of removal \nalone cannot constitute” the sort of “irreparable injury” that equity requires.  Nken v. \nHolder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009).  And although the district court apparently assumed that \nCristian is confined—which is likely true7—it did so without either evidence or a clear \nrepresentation from either party about where he was or under what conditions.  See ECF \n253 at 4.  In all events, any cause of action for these sorts of injuries themselves (rather \nthan the asylum consequences that they may bring) does not arise from the agreement \nhere.8 \n \n7 The parties’ representations have shifted on this front, both below and on appeal.  \nIn the introduction to its motion to enforce below, class counsel asserted that ICE “removed \nCristian . . . to a maximum security prison in El Salvador.”  ECF 227-1 at 1.  Yet the \nbackground section of that brief did not repeat or explain this claim; it only said that \nCristian had been “removed . . . to El Salvador.”  Id. at 5.  Counsel neither offered a citation \nnor said which prison or whether Cristian was still there.  Now, counsel’s position is that \nCristian “has remained incarcerated in El Salvador at CECOT since” his removal, and so \n“for  two  months . . .  has  been  consigned  to  a  notorious  supermax  prison  known  for \nwidespread human rights violations.”  Opposition at 9, 21 (quotation omitted).  The citation \noffered for this premise is the government’s stay motion—which, unsurprisingly, says no \nsuch thing.  The government says only that Cristian “is currently in the custody of El \nSalvador.”  Motion at 7.  Yet the government itself gets this premise not from a declaration \nby its personnel but from Cristian’s motion below.  And the cited page says nothing about \nprison—just that “ICE removed Cristian to El Salvador.”  ECF 227-1 at 5.  By a telephone-\ngame string of citations, a claim that Cristian was removed two months ago became a claim \nthat he is in CECOT today.  Again, this may well be true.  But if it is, I fail to see how class \ncounsel knows it.  In my view, the district court should have collected more information \nand made findings of fact—as the district court in Abrego Garcia is still doing—before \nimposing an injunction. \n \n8 This is not to say that Cristian cannot challenge his removal and detention, if any, \nin another proceeding.  Like anyone removed under the Alien Enemies Act, Cristian is \nentitled to the full measure of protection afforded by our due process jurisprudence.  As in \n(Continued) \n46 \n \n\n \nB \nOn the other side of the ledger lie weighty government interests.  Ordering the \ngovernment to negotiate threatens the foreign policy interests of the United States.  The \nproblems of foreign affairs are “important, complicated, [and] delicate.”  Curtiss-Wright, \n299 U.S. at 319.  Goodwill from foreign states is hard-won but easily lost.  Toward the end \nof the Washington Administration, then-Senator and future-Chief Justice Oliver Ellsworth \nexhorted the Senate, “A correspondence with foreign nations [is] a business of difficulty \nand delicacy—the peace and tranquility of a country may hinge on it.”  5 Annals of Cong. \n32 (1796).  In line with this maxim, federal courts have been quick to see danger in this \narea.  See, e.g., Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 395 (2012); Crosby v. Nat’l Foreign \nTrade Council, 530 U.S. 363, 385–86 (2000).  As then-Judge Scalia warned, “extend[ing] \njudicial power into” the realm of foreign affairs is risky because “we do not know, and \nhave no way of finding out, what serious harm we may be doing.”  Ramirez de Arellano v. \nWeinberger,  745  F.2d  1500,  1551  (D.C.  Cir.  1984)  (Scalia,  J.,  dissenting);  see  also \nContainer Corp. of Am. v. Franchise Tax Bd., 463 U.S. 159, 194 (1983) (recognizing \ncourts’  limited  “competence  in  determining  precisely  when  foreign  nations  will  be \noffended by particular acts”). \n  This danger looms above more everyday concerns—concerns that usually warrant \na stay by themselves.  Enjoining the government from enforcing duly enacted policies \n \nAbrego Garcia, if Cristian is confined, he could seek injunctive relief on the grounds that \nhis removal was erroneous or that the proclamation is unlawful.  Important as those \nchallenges may be, they are not presented here. \n47 \n \n\n \nalways counts as irreparable injury.  Maryland v. King, 567 U.S. 1301, 1303 (2012) \n(Roberts, C.J., in chambers) (citing New Motor Vehicle Bd. v. Orrin W. Fox Co., 434 U.S. \n1345, 1351 (1977) (Rehnquist, J., in chambers)).  The harm compounds when, as here, the \ninjunction not only prevents prospective government action but orders a costly about-face.  \nAnd the interest that injury impairs, “[p]rotection of the foreign policy of the United \nStates[,] is a governmental interest of great importance, since foreign policy and national \nsecurity cannot neatly be compartmentalized.”  Haig v. Agee, 453 U.S. 280, 307 (1981).   \nGiven all this, I see the government’s burden as met.  See Nken, 556 U.S. at 426.  \nThe government should prevail on the merits because this injunction exceeds the district \ncourt’s power and because Cristian’s claim does not warrant it.  Moreover, the injunction \nthreatens important government interests that are easier to harm than heal, and it does so \nwithout offering Cristian any meaningful benefit in return.  That is not how courts sitting \nin equity are supposed to proceed.  I would stay the injunction.9 \n*  *  * \nThis is not a case about whether the President’s Alien Enemies proclamation fits the \nstatute.  This is not a case about what process the Constitution and laws may afford those \nremoved under that proclamation.  And this is not a case where the courts are asked to \nthwart an effort “to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons.”  Abrego \nGarcia, 2025 WL 1135112, at *1.  It is instead a contract case.  An important contract case, \n \n9 I take no position on how the district court should have resolved the government’s \nRule 60(b) motion.  Only the government’s stay motion is before us now, and that aims at \nthe injunction itself—not the district court’s refusal to vacate it. \n48 \n \n\n \nperhaps, but not a case where either the Executive’s powers or Cristian’s liberties will be \nfinally decided. \nStill, it is in this case that the district court has directed the Executive to engage in \nspecific diplomatic negotiations with a foreign power.  Despite serious merits problems \nand little reason to think its order would help Cristian, the district court entered a more \npotent injunction than any other court has in the numerous Alien Enemies cases pending \nacross the country.  By contrast, consider Abrego Garcia, where the parties and court \nremain dutifully preoccupied with crafting appropriate relief that still gives “due regard for \nthe deference owed to the Executive Branch.”  145 S. Ct. at 1018.  In cases like these, \nwhere “the branches come too close to grinding irrevocably against one another,” Abrego \nGarcia, 2025 WL 1135112, at *3, caution should be our watchword. \nAs I would stay Paragraph 2 of the district court’s order, I respectfully dissent. \n \n49 \n ",

INTRODUCTION  \nThe parties jointly seek preliminary approval of the class action settlement (Exhibit 1, \n“Settlement Agreement”) of the claims brought by Plaintiffs on behalf of the certified class \nchallenging  immigration  policies  related  to  asylum  protections  for  unaccompanied  children \n(“UCs”),1 approval of the proposed plan for providing notice of the Settlement Agreement to class \nmembers, and amendment of the class definition.  The Settlement Agreement, if approved, will \nresolve the claims of the Plaintiffs and the certified class related to policies reflected in a U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Services’ (“USCIS”) May 31, 2019 memorandum, titled “Updated \nProcedures  for  Asylum  Applications  Filed  by  Unaccompanied  Alien  Children”  (“2019 \nRedetermination Memo”), which changed how USCIS would implement certain asylum-related \nprotections provided to unaccompanied children under the  William Wilberforce Trafficking \nVictims Protection Reauthorization Act (“TVPRA”).   \nUnder a policy issued on May 28, 2013, USCIS exercised initial jurisdiction over asylum \napplications filed by applicants in removal proceedings whom DHS had previously determined to \nbe unaccompanied children.  USCIS accepted initial jurisdiction over the asylum application even \nif the individual turned 18 or reunified with a parent or legal guardian before they filed the \napplication.  USCIS would also hold such applications exempt from the one-year filing deadline \nthat generally applies to asylum applications.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(E).  On May 31, 2019, \nUSCIS modified its policy and announced that, effective in 30 days, new and pending asylum \n \n1 The terms “unaccompanied children” and “unaccompanied child,” as used herein, refer to \n“unaccompanied alien children,” defined at 6 U.S.C. § 279(g)(2) as “a child who—(A) has no \nlawful immigration status in the United States; (B) has not attained 18 years of age; and (C) with \nrespect to whom—(i) there is no parent or legal guardian in the United States; or (ii) no parent or \nlegal guardian in the United States is available to provide care and physical custody.”  The \nSettlement Agreement also uses the same definition.  Ex. 1, II(U). \n  1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-1     Filed 07/30/24     Page 5 of 27\n \napplications of those with unaccompanied child determinations previously made by DHS upon \nencounter would be subject to additional factual inquiry to confirm that the child still met the \nstatutory UC definition at the time of filing, a more restrictive approach.  The May 2019 policy \nalso required USCIS to reject jurisdiction over an asylum claim if an immigration court concluded, \nbased on its own factual findings, that USCIS lacked jurisdiction.  Those applicants who were \nfound to no longer meet the definition of a UC would be subject to a one-year filing deadline and \nrequired to present their asylum claims to the immigration judge in an adversarial court hearing in \nthe first and only instance. \nThe Settlement Agreement, if approved, will provide relief to class members, including by \nrequiring USCIS to exercise initial jurisdiction over class members’ asylum applications and \nadjudicate the applications on the merits, and to hold such applications exempt from the one-year \ndeadline.  Under the agreement, USCIS will not defer to an immigration judge’s finding that a \nclass member does not qualify for USCIS’ initial jurisdiction under the TVPRA.  USCIS will also \nretract any adverse jurisdictional determinations rendered on or after June 30, 2019 that merit \nretraction under the process described in the Settlement Agreement. \nThe Settlement Agreement provides relief to the class and is fair, reasonable, and adequate, \nand therefore  warrants  preliminary approval.   The  Settlement Agreement is the product of \nextensive arm’s-length negotiations between experienced and informed counsel under Court \nsupervision.  Accordingly, the parties respectfully request that the Court: (1) preliminarily approve \nthe proposed Settlement Agreement; (2) amend the class definition as specified in the Settlement \nAgreement; (3) order that the proposed class notice (Ex. C of the Settlement Agreement) be \nprovided to the class in accordance with the Settlement Agreement; and (4) schedule a Fairness \nHearing.  \n  2 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-1     Filed 07/30/24     Page 6 of 27\n \nII.  NATURE AND BACKGROUND OF CASE \nA.  Factual Background \nEffective June 10, 2013, USCIS policy was to exercise its statutory initial jurisdiction over \nasylum applications filed by applicants in removal proceedings who had been determined an \nunaccompanied child upon encounter and that determination that had not been rescinded through \nan “affirmative act” by CBP, ICE, or ORR before the applicant filed the application.  Even if an \napplicant reached the age of 18 or reunited with a parent or legal guardian before filing the \napplication, USCIS would exercise initial jurisdiction over the applicant’s asylum application \nbased on the previous unaccompanied child determination.  This policy was reflected in a May 28, \n2013 memorandum, titled “Updated Procedures for Determination of Initial Jurisdiction over \nAsylum Applications Filed by Unaccompanied Alien Children,” known as the 2013 Kim Memo. \nThe 2019 Redetermination Memo changed how USCIS would implement those protections \nprovided for unaccompanied children.  Under the 2019 Redetermination Memo, if an applicant in \nremoval proceedings had previously been determined to be an unaccompanied child, and had \napplied for asylum after turning 18 or reunifying with a parent or legal guardian, USCIS would \ndecline jurisdiction over their asylum application.  The 2019 Redetermination Memo also directed \nthat in those circumstances, an applicant previously determined to be an unaccompanied child who \nno  longer  met  the  definition  would  be  subject  to  the  one-year  deadline  for  filing  asylum \napplications. \nB.  Procedural Background \nOn July 1, 2019, four named plaintiffs commenced this litigation for declaratory and \ninjunctive relief, alleging that the USCIS policy changes reflected in the 2019 Redetermination \nMemo were adopted in violation of the Administrative Procedures Act (“APA”), the Immigration \nand Nationality Act, and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  \n  3 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-1     Filed 07/30/24     Page 7 of 27\n \nECF No. 1.  On August 2, 2019, the Court entered a temporary restraining order (“TRO”), \nenjoining and restraining Defendants, during the pendency of the litigation, from (i) applying the \npolicy set forth in the 2019 Redetermination Memo to decline jurisdiction over asylum applications \nfiled with USCIS by individuals previously determined to be unaccompanied children; and (ii) \nrejecting jurisdiction over the application of any unaccompanied child whose application would \nhave been accepted under the 2013 USCIS policy predating the 2019 Redetermination Memo.  \nECF No. 55.  The Court also ordered Defendant USCIS to retract any adverse jurisdictional \ndecision already rendered in an individual case applying the 2019 Redetermination Memo and \nreinstate consideration of such case applying the prior policy, as set forth in the 2013 Kim Memo.  \nECF No. 54; ECF No. 55.  On October 15, 2019, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion for a \npreliminary injunction, enjoining Defendants from the foregoing conduct for the pendency of the \nlitigation.  ECF No. 71. \nOn November 13, 2019, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims, or in the \nalternative, for summary judgment.  ECF No 73.  On December 20, 2019, the named Plaintiffs \nfiled an amended complaint that also alleged, inter alia, that USCIS had adopted an unlawful \npolicy, as reflected in the 2019 Redetermination Memo, to defer to a determination by an Executive \nOffice for Immigration Review (“EOIR”) immigration judge that USCIS lacked jurisdiction over \nan asylum application if it was not an application filed by a UAC.  ECF No. 91.  Defendants filed \na motion to dismiss the amended complaint on January 3, 2020.  ECF No. 101.  The Court denied \nboth of Defendants’ motions to dismiss on June 3, 2020.  ECF No. 115. \nOn July 24, 2020, USCIS filed a certified administrative record with the Court, ECF No. \n128, which it later amended on October 2, 2020, ECF No. 138.  Plaintiffs asserted that significant \ndeficiencies remained in the amended administrative record.  See ECF No. 141. \n  4 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-1     Filed 07/30/24     Page 8 of 27\n \nOn December 21, 2020, the Court entered an amended preliminary injunction, restraining \nDefendants  from  implementing  that  policy.    Specifically,  under  the  amended  preliminary \ninjunction, Defendants are \n(1) enjoined and restrained from relying on the policies set forth in \nthe 2019 [Redetermination Memo] as a basis to decline jurisdiction \nover asylum applications of individuals previously determined to be \nunaccompanied  alien  children  (“UACs”),  to  subject  an  asylum \napplicant to the one-year time limit for filing described at 8 U.S.C. \n§  1158(a)(2)(B),  or  for  any  other  purpose;  (2)  enjoined  and \nrestrained from rejecting jurisdiction over any asylum application \nfiled by Plaintiffs and members of the class whose applications \nwould have been accepted under the 2013 Kim Memo; (3) enjoined \nand restrained from deferring to EOIR determinations in assessing \njurisdiction  over  asylum  applications  filed  by  Plaintiffs  and \nmembers of the proposed class; and (4) enjoined and restrained \nduring the removal proceedings of any Plaintiff or member of the \nclass (including EOIR proceedings before immigration judges and \nmembers  of  the  Board  of  Immigration  Appeals)  from  seeking \ndenials of continuances or other postponements in order to await \nadjudication  of  an  asylum  application  that  has  been  filed  with \nUSCIS, from seeking EOIR exercise of jurisdiction over any asylum \nclaim where USCIS has initial jurisdiction under the terms of the \n2013 Kim Memo, or from otherwise taking a position in such \nindividual’s removal proceedings that, inconsistent with the 2013 \nKim  Memo,  USCIS  does  not  have  initial  jurisdiction  over  the \nindividual’s asylum application. \nECF No. 144 at 2. \nOn December 21, 2020, The Court also certified the following class pursuant to Rule \n23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure:   \nAll individuals nationwide who prior to the effective date of a \nlawfully promulgated policy prospectively altering the policy set \nforth in the 2013 Kim Memorandum (1) were determined to be an \nUnaccompanied  Alien  Child;  and  (2)  who  filed  an  asylum \napplication that was pending with the United States Citizenship and \nImmigration Services (“USCIS”); and (3) on the date they filed their \nasylum application with USCIS, were 18 years of age or older, or \nhad a parent or legal guardian in the United States who is available \nto provide care and physical custody; and (4) for whom USCIS has \nnot adjudicated the individual’s asylum application on the merits. \n  5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-1     Filed 07/30/24     Page 9 of 27\n \nECF No. 144 at 1.  The Court also ordered USCIS to “retract any adverse decision rendered on or \nafter June 30, 2019 that is based in whole or in part on any of the [enjoined] actions.”  Id. at 2. \nOn February 19, 2021, Defendants filed a notice of appeal from the Court’s December 21, \n2020 Order with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.  At Defendants’ request, the \nappeal has been held in abeyance since July 12, 2021, and remains pending with the Fourth Circuit.  \nDefendants  have  agreed  to  withdraw  the  appeal  upon  the  final  approval  of  the  Settlement \nAgreement.  Ex. 1, Settlement Agreement (hereinafter “Ex. 1”) at IV(I). \nOn January 11, 2021, Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint adding allegations that \nUSCIS had adopted an unlawful policy or practice of treating recognitions or notations as to \nevidence that a child has turned 18 or been reunited with a parent or legal guardian as “affirmative \nacts” defeating USCIS initial jurisdiction under the 2013 Kim Memo.  On March 4, 2021, \nDefendants agreed that USCIS will not make jurisdictional determinations that rely solely on an \nunaccompanied child redetermination noted in ICE or DHS systems as terminating a prior \nunaccompanied child determination, unless it documents that ICE placed the individual in ICE \ncustody as an adult detainee, and that while this agreement remains in effect, USCIS will place on \nhold cases involving any other type of act that might qualify under the 2013 Kim Memo as an \n“affirmative act” before filing. \nOn December 21, 2020, the Court granted the parties’ motion to stay the existing summary \njudgement briefing schedule in this case.  ECF No. 144.  Since early 2021, the parties have engaged \nin negotiations in hopes of reaching a settlement of some or all of Plaintiffs’ claims. \nC.  History of Settlement Negotiations  \nThe parties began to focus on settlement discussions in or about January 2021, and since \nthat time engaged in at least 12 sessions, conducted virtually, to discuss possible settlement terms.  \n  6 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-1     Filed 07/30/24     Page 10 of 27\n \nThese sessions were attended by counsel for both sides and representatives of the Defendant \nagencies.  The parties also exchanged drafts of a settlement agreement more than ten times since \n2021. \nThe parties began settlement discussions in 2021 without the participation of a court-\nappointed mediator.  During the ensuing year, the parties exchanged a series of revised drafts of \nproposed settlement terms.  On January 13, 2022, the parties jointly requested that the Court refer \nthe case to a magistrate judge for alternative dispute resolution, ECF No. 161, and on January 14, \n2022, the Court referred the case to Hon. Judge Jillyn K. Schulze for alternative dispute resolution, \nECF No. 163.  The parties subsequently provided mediation statements to Judge Schulze and \nparticipated in remote mediation sessions under Judge Schulze’s supervision, while continuing to \nexchange drafts of a settlement agreement. \nOn October 31, 2023, the case was assigned to Chief Magistrate Judge Timothy Sullivan \nfor mediation.  ECF No. 193.  The parties subsequently exchanged further drafts of the settlement \nagreement, and participated in a two-day, in-person settlement conference totaling approximately \n21 hours in March 2024 overseen by Chief Magistrate Judge Sullivan.  During that conference, \nthe parties were able to resolve most all outstanding issues, and on June 17, 2024, the parties \nexecuted the Settlement Agreement.    \nIII.  THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \nA.  USCIS Implementing Memorandum  \nPursuant to the Settlement Agreement, USCIS will issue a memorandum, effective 90 days \nafter the Court’s final approval of the agreement, that will explain and implement the Settlement \nAgreement.  Ex. 1, III(A).  This superseding memorandum will apply to class members as well as \nother  individuals  with  prior  unaccompanied  children  determinations  who  file  an  asylum \n  7 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-1     Filed 07/30/24     Page 11 of 27\n \napplication when the memorandum is in effect, and will remain in effect for at least three years \nfrom its effective date.  Id.   \nB.  Amendment of the Class Definition \nAs set forth in the Settlement Agreement, the parties agree to seek amendment of the class \ndefinition, as follows, to facilitate implementation of the settlement by providing for a cut-off date \nfor the addition of new class members:  \n[A]ll  individuals  nationwide  who  prior  to  the  effective  date  of    a  lawfully \npromulgated policy prospectively altering the policy set forth in the 2013 Kim \nMemorandum the superseding memorandum discussed in Section III(A): (1) were \ndetermined to be a UAC; and (2) who filed an asylum application that was pending \nwith USCIS; and (3) on the date they filed their asylum application with USCIS, \nwere 18 years of age or older, or had a parent or legal guardian in the United States \nwho is available to provide care and physical custody; and (4) for whom USCIS \nhas not adjudicated the individual’s asylum application on the merits. \n \nEx. 1, II(E).  The certified class definition extends class membership to individuals who file an \nasylum application before the effective date “of a lawfully promulgated policy altering the policy \nset forth in the 2013 Kim Memorandum.”  ECF No. 144 at 1.  The proposed amended definition \nspecifies that the effective date of USCIS’s superseding memorandum will serve as the cutoff date \nfor class membership.  The amended definition thus clarifies the date by which an individual must \nfile their asylum application in order to be a class member. \nC.  Benefits to the Settlement Class  \nThe Settlement Agreement provides many significant benefits to the class members, \nincluding but not limited to the following benefits.  First, it memorializes that USCIS has fully \nrescinded  the  2019  Redetermination  Memo  and  requires  USCIS  to  issue  the  superseding \nmemorandum described above.  Ex. 1, III(A).  Second, USCIS will exercise initial jurisdiction \nover the asylum applications filed by class members, will adjudicate those applications on the \nmerits, and will hold the applications exempt from one-year filing deadline.  Ex A, III(B).  Third, \n  8 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-1     Filed 07/30/24     Page 12 of 27\n \nin assessing its jurisdiction over applications filed by a class member, USCIS will not defer to any \ndeterminations  by  an  immigration  judge,  however,  USCIS  may  adopt  a  previous  EOIR \ndetermination that a class member was a UAC at the time of filing their asylum application for the \npurposes of accepting initial jurisdiction.  Ex. 1, III(D).    \nFourth, USCIS will also retract any adverse jurisdictional determinations rendered on or \nafter June 30, 2019, that merit retraction, in accordance with the timelines and processes described \nin the Settlement Agreement.  Ex. 1, III(C), III(E).  Fifth, with respect to class members in removal \nproceedings, DHS will not take the position that USCIS does not have initial jurisdiction over a \nclass member’s asylum application.  Ex. 1, III(H).  Sixth, DHS will join or non-oppose a motion \nfor a continuance or administrative closure filed by a class member in order to await USCIS \nexercise of its initial jurisdiction over the asylum application.  Id.   \nD.  Opt-Outs and Objections  \nDue to the nature of the relief offered to the class members, the parties believe that an opt-\nout provision is not necessary for the protection of the rights of the class, and no opt-out provision \nis included in the Settlement Agreement.  The Settlement Agreement does provide a procedure for \nclass members to object to the Settlement and/or be heard at the fairness hearing.  Ex. 1, IV(F).    \nE.  Proposed Plan of Notice  \nThe parties’ proposed plan to provide notice to class member is designed to reach as many \nclass members as possible.  As set forth in the Settlement Agreement, the parties shall effectuate \nthe following: \n1.  Class Counsel shall post the Class Notice (in English and Spanish), including a \ncopy of the Settlement Agreement, on Public Counsel’s, National Immigration \nProject’s, and Kids in Need of Defense’s websites; \n  9 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-1     Filed 07/30/24     Page 13 of 27\n \n2.  USCIS shall post the Class Notice (in English and Spanish), including a copy \nof the Settlement Agreement, on USCIS’s website on the “USCIS Class Action, \nSettlement Notices and Agreements” and the “Asylum” sections;  \n3.  ICE shall post the Class Notice (in English and Spanish), including a copy of \nthe Settlement Agreement, on ICE’s website on the “Legal Notices” section;  \n4.  Class Counsel shall distribute the Class Notice (in English and Spanish), \nincluding a copy of the Settlement Agreement, on relevant (as determined by \nClass Counsel) email or list serv mailing lists for legal services providers; and  \n5.  USCIS’s Office of Public Affairs shall email the Class Notice (in English and \nSpanish), including a copy of the Settlement Agreement, to its approximately \n47,000 subscribed users. \nEx. 1, IV(E).  The parties’ proposed Class Notice for the Court’s approval is attached as Exhibit \nC of the Settlement Agreement (Ex. 1). \nF.  Attorneys’ Fees and Costs  \nThe parties agree that Plaintiffs’ request for attorneys’ fees and costs does not require \nresolution  before  final  approval  of  this  Settlement  Agreement.    The  Settlement  Agreement \nprovides that “[a]ny application for fees and/or costs shall be filed no later than 30 days after the \nCourt issues its final approval of this Settlement Agreement,” and that the Court shall retain \njurisdiction to resolve any application for fees and/or costs.  Ex. 1, IV(H), VII.   Plaintiffs may file \na petition to the Court for an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, no later than 30 days after the \nCourt issues its final approval of this Settlement Agreement, as set forth in the Settlement \nAgreement.  Exh. 1, VII.   \n  10 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-1     Filed 07/30/24     Page 14 of 27\n \nIV.  LEGAL STANDARD \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e) provides that “[t]he claims, issues, or defenses of a \ncertified class . . . may be settled, voluntarily dismissed, or compromised only with the court’s \napproval.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e).  The Court may approve a class action settlement only after a \nfairness hearing, and only after finding that the settlement agreement is “fair, reasonable, and \nadequate.”  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2).  The purpose of this rule is to protect class members \nwhose rights may not have been given adequate consideration during the settlement negotiations.  \nIn re Jiffy Lube Sec. Litig., 927 F.2d 155, 158 (4th Cir. 1991).   \nCourts follow a two-step procedure for approval of a class action settlement.  In re Mid–\nAtlantic Toyota Antitrust Litig., 564 F. Supp. 1379, 1384 (D. Md. 1983); see also Manual for \nComplex Litig. (“MCL 4th”) § 21.632, at 414 (4th ed. 2004); Grice v. PNC Mortg. Corp. of Am., \nNo. 97-3084, 1998 WL 350581, at *2 (D. Md. May 21, 1998) (endorsing MCL 4th’s two-step \nprocess).  In the first stage, the parties submit the proposed settlement to the Court for preliminary \napproval, which should be granted when a proposed settlement is “within the range of possible \napproval.”  See In Re Mid–Atlantic Toyota Antitrust Litig., 564 F. Supp. at 1384.  Put another way, \npreliminary approval is meant to determine whether the settlement is likely to be approved, such \nthat it warrants sending notice to the class and holding a fairness hearing.  Id.; see Boger v. Citrix \nSys., Inc., No. 19-01234, 2023 WL 1415625, at *3 (D. Md. January 31, 2023).  In the second stage, \nfollowing preliminary approval, the class is notified, and a fairness hearing scheduled at which the \nCourt determines whether to approve the settlement.  This two-step procedure safeguards class \nmembers’ due process rights and enables the Court to fulfill its role as the guardian of class \ninterests.  See 5 Herbert B. Newberg & Alba Conte, Newberg on Class Actions § 13:1 (5th ed. \n2016).   \n  11 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-1     Filed 07/30/24     Page 15 of 27\n \nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e)(2), the Court should consider the following \nfactors in evaluating whether a settlement agreement is fair, reasonable, and adequate: \n(A) the class representatives and class counsel have adequately represented the \nclass; \n \n(B) the proposal was negotiated at arm’s length; \n(C) the relief provided for the class is adequate, taking into account: \n(i) the costs, risks, and delay of trial and appeal; \n(ii) the effectiveness of any proposed method of distributing relief to the \nclass, including the method of processing class-member claims; \n \n(iii) the terms of any proposed award of attorney's fees, including timing of \npayment; and \n \n(iv) any agreement required to be identified under Rule 23(e)(3); and \n(D) the proposal treats class members equitably relative to each other. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2).   \nThe above factors arose from an amendment of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e) in 2018.  Before that \ntime, the Fourth Circuit had “developed multifactor standards for assessing whether a class-action \nsettlement is ‘fair, reasonable, and adequate’ under Rule 23(e)(2).”  In re: Lumber Liquidators \nChinese-Manufactured Flooring Prod. Mktg., Sales Pracs. & Prod. Liab. Litig., 952 F.3d 471, 484 \n(4th Cir. 2020) (hereinafter, “Lumber Liquidators”).  Specifically, the Fourth Circuit has specified \nthe following factors for assessing “fairness”: (1) the posture of the case at the time settlement was \nproposed; (2) the extent of discovery that had been conducted; (3) the circumstances surrounding \nthe negotiations; and (4) the experience of counsel in the area of [the] class action litigation.  Id.  \nWhile the Fourth Circuit has “not enumerated factors assessing a settlement’s reasonableness,” it \nhas specified factors for assessing its adequacy, including: (1) the relative strength of the plaintiffs’ \ncase on the merits; (2) the existence of any difficulties of proof or strong defenses the plaintiffs \n  12 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-1     Filed 07/30/24     Page 16 of 27\n \nare likely to encounter if the case goes to trial; (3) the anticipated duration and expense of \nadditional litigation; (4) the solvency of the defendant[ ] and the likelihood of recovery on a \nlitigated judgment; and (5) the degree of opposition to the settlement.”  Id. \nThe Fourth Circuit’s “factors for assessing class-action settlements almost completely \noverlap with the new Rule 23(e)(2) factors.”  Id.; see also Herrera v. Charlotte Sch. of L., LLC, \n818 F. App’x 165, 176 n.4 (4th Cir. 2020) (“Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e)(2) has been \namended  and  now  sets  forth  factors  for  the  district  court  to  assess  in  evaluating  fairness, \nreasonableness, and adequacy.”).  Recognizing this overlap, at least one Fourth Circuit panel has \ncontinued to apply the Fourth Circuit factors after the Rule 23(e)(2) amendments, “as they almost \ncompletely overlap with the new Rule 23(e)(2) factors, rendering the analysis the same.”  Herrera, \n818 F. App’x at 176 n.4.   \nApplying either the Rule 23(e)(2) factors or the Fourth Circuit’s factors, the Settlement \nAgreement  here  is  fair,  reasonable,  and  adequate,  and  therefore  the  agreement  should  be \npreliminarily approved. \nV.  THE  SETTLEMENT  AGREEMENT  SHOULD  BE  PRELIMINARILY \nAPPROVED  \n \nA.  The Rule 23(e)(2) Factors All Support Preliminary Approval of the Settlement \nAgreement \nEach of the factors set forth in Rule 23(e)(2) support preliminary approval of the Settlement \nAgreement.   \nFirst, the “class representatives and class counsel have adequately represented the class.”  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2)(A).  In granting class certification and appointing class counsel, the Court \nheld that there was “adequate representation,” as required under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  ECF No. \n143 at 37.  Specifically, the Court held that “there does not appear to be any conflict between the \nnamed plaintiffs and the other class members” and that “counsel is qualified and experienced.”  Id.  \n  13 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-1     Filed 07/30/24     Page 17 of 27\n \nClass representatives made themselves available for consultation during the course of the litigation \nand years-long settlement process.  Class counsel’s success in motion practice prior to settlement \ndiscussions further reinforces that the class was adequately represented.  In contested motions, \nclass counsel successfully obtained a TRO and preliminary injunction (which was later expanded); \nwere granted leave to file an amended complaint; and secured denial of Defendants’ motion to \ndismiss.  See ECF Nos. 55, 71, 115, 144.  Furthermore, during the course of this litigation, class \ncounsel have raised possible violations of the preliminary injunction for individual class members, \nleading to resolution of the issues for those class members. \nSecond, the Settlement Agreement is the result of good faith bargaining at arm’s length.  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2)(B).  The parties began negotiating settlement in 2021, and have attended \nat least 12 settlement meetings remotely wherein the parties have discussed the terms of a \nsettlement agreement.  Since 2021, the parties exchanged at least ten drafts of a settlement \nagreement.  Further, the parties attended a two-day in-person session in March 2024, mediated by \nChief Magistrate Judge Timothy Sullivan, in which the final terms of the Settlement Agreement \nwere agreed upon.  There has been no collusion between class counsel and Defendants. \nThird, “the relief provided for the class is adequate.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2)(C).  As a \npreliminary matter, the terms of the Settlement Agreement provide significant benefits for class \nmembers, supporting the reasonableness and adequacy of the agreement.  USCIS has agreed that \nit will exercise initial jurisdiction over class members’ asylum applications and will not defer to \nan immigration judge’s determination as to whether the class member qualifies for initial USCIS \njurisdiction  as  an  unaccompanied  child,  however,  USCIS  may  adopt  a  previous  EOIR \ndetermination that a class member was a UAC at the time of filing their asylum application for the \npurposes of accepting initial jurisdiction.  Ex. 1, III(C)(3), III(D).  Thus, the Settlement Agreement \n  14 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-1     Filed 07/30/24     Page 18 of 27\n \nprovides  relief  to  class  members  whose  rights  would  have  been  impaired  if  the  2019 \nRedetermination Policy were allowed to remain in effect.  For example, class members who \nreceived an adverse jurisdictional determination, pursuant to the previous policy will have their \nprior determination retracted.  Ex. 1, III(E).  And, with respect to class members in removal \nproceedings, DHS will not take the position that USCIS does not have initial jurisdiction over a \nclass member’s asylum application and will join or non-oppose a motion for a continuance or \nadministrative closure filed by a class member in order to await USCIS exercise of its initial \njurisdiction over the asylum application.  Ex. 1, III(H).  In short, under the Settlement Agreement, \nclass members will now have the opportunity for their asylum applications to be decided on the \nmerits by USCIS.  \nUnder Rule 23(e)(2)(B), the adequacy of a settlement agreement must also be evaluated in \nview of the “costs, risk, and delay of trial and appeal.”2  While Plaintiffs believe they have a strong \nlikelihood  of  prevailing  on  the  merits,  either  at  summary  judgment  or  at  trial,  Plaintiffs \nacknowledge that uncertainty remains as to a final outcome if the case were litigated to a final \ndecision.  For example, Plaintiffs acknowledge that the Court did not agree, at the TRO stage, with \nPlaintiffs’ argument that USCIS acted in excess of statutory authority because the redetermination \npolicy, as set forth in the May 31, 2019 memorandum, is inconsistent with the TVPRA.  ECF No. \n54 at 13.  Furthermore, Defendants have appealed the Courts’ grant of a preliminary injunction \nand Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, and Plaintiffs acknowledge that a merits adjudication \nof the appeal pending in the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit entails prolonged timelines \n \n2 Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2)(B) also refers to “the terms of any proposed award of attorney’s fees, \nincluding timing of payment.”  This factor is not relevant here.  With respect to attorneys’ fees, \nthe parties have agreed, as set forth in the Settlement Agreement, that class counsel may file a \npetition for fees within a month after final approval of the agreement.   \n  15 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-1     Filed 07/30/24     Page 19 of 27\n \nand  uncertain  outcomes.    This  uncertainty  supports  preliminary  approval  of  the  Settlement \nAgreement as an adequate resolution of Plaintiffs’ and the class members’ claims.  Continuing to \nlitigate would also likely result in significant delays, potentially for several years, in class members \n—whose asylum applications USCIS declined jurisdiction or placed on hold—being able to have \nan adjudication of their asylum case on the merits.  Settlement at this time will further benefit those \nclass  members  by  allowing  their  asylum  applications  to  be  placed  in  USCIS’s  queue  for \nadjudication so that they can be heard on the merits without further delay.     \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2)(B) also requires consideration of  “the effectiveness of any \nproposed method of distributing relief to the class, including the method of processing class-\nmember claims.”  This too supports the adequacy of the Settlement Agreement.  Given the nature \nof the claims at issue in this case, there is no monetary award that will be distributed to class \nmembers,  nor  will  class  members  be  required  to  submit  claims  to  be  processed.    Rather \nDefendants’ compliance with the terms of the Settlement Agreement will provide relief.  For \nexample,  USCIS  has  agreed  to  exercise  initial  jurisdiction  over  class  members’  asylum \napplications  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  Settlement  Agreement;  to  adjudicate  the \napplication on the merits; and to hold the applications exempt from a one-year filing deadline.  Ex. \n1, III(B). \nFinally, “the proposal treats class members equitably relative to each other.”  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 23(e)(2)(D).  The Settlement Agreement treats all class members equitably, as all are entitled to \nthe same benefits.  Accordingly, this factor also supports preliminary approval of the Settlement \nAgreement.     \n  16 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-1     Filed 07/30/24     Page 20 of 27\n \nB.  The  Fourth  Circuit  Factors  Also  Support  Preliminary  Approval  of  the \nSettlement Agreement \nThe  Fourth  Circuit  factors  also  support  a  preliminary  finding  that  the  Settlement \nAgreement is fair and adequate.  In some cases, the Fourth Circuit has “continue[d] to apply its \nown standards as they ‘almost completely overlap with the new Rule 23(e)(2) factors,’ rendering \nthe analysis the same” as under Rule 23(e)(2).  Herrera, 818 F. App’x at 176.    \n1.  The Settlement Agreement is Fair \nThe Fourth Circuit has specified the following factors for assessing “fairness”: (1) the \nposture of the case at the time settlement was proposed; (2) the extent of discovery that had been \nconducted; (3) the circumstances surrounding the negotiations; and (4) the experience of counsel \nin the area of [the] class action litigation.”  Lumber Liquidators, 952 F.3d at 484.  Each factor \nsupports a finding that this Settlement Agreement is fair. \nFirst, the posture of the case at the time settlement was proposed reinforces that the \nSettlement Agreement is fair.  Lumber Liquidators, 952 F.3d at 484.  This case was not in its \ninfancy at the time that settlement discussion began; rather, the parties had already litigated \nsubstantial issues and were prepared to go forward into summary judgment and trial.  On June 3, \n2020, the Court denied Defendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims, or in the alternative, for \nsummary judgment.  ECF No. 115.  The Court granted a preliminary injunction, which it later \nexpanded once, and also certified the class.  ECF Nos. 71, 144.  The case has been stayed since \nDecember 2020 (ECF No. 144), and since early 2021 the parties have been engaged in settlement \nnegotiations, which culminated in the two-day in-person session mediated by Chief Magistrate \nJudge Sullivan.   \nSecond, the extent of discovery conducted also supports preliminary approval of the \nSettlement Agreement.  Lumber Liquidators, 952 F.3d at 484.  This class action case involved \n  17 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-1     Filed 07/30/24     Page 21 of 27\n \nallegations of Defendants’ failure to comply with the APA, and therefore Defendants were \nobligated to produce the relevant administrative record.  On July 24, 2020, USCIS filed a certified \nadministrative record with the Court, ECF No. 128, which it amended on October 2, 2020, ECF \nNo. 138.  Class counsel conducted a thorough review of the administrative record produced in the \nlitigation which resulted in well-informed settlement negotiations.    \nThird, the circumstances surrounding settlement discussions and the experience of class \ncounsel also supports preliminary approval.  Lumber Liquidators, 952 F.3d at 484.  The Settlement \nAgreement is the result of extensive, arm’s-length negotiations between counsel for the Parties \nwho are familiar with the legal and factual issues of this Action.  Class counsel have deep \nexperience in the specialized needs of unaccompanied children.  The named Plaintiffs relied on \nthe judgment of counsel, who have extensive experience litigating, settling, and trying immigration \ncases and related class actions.  Indeed, in such circumstances, it may be presumed that a settlement \nis fair.  See Good v. W. Va.-Am. Water Co., No. 14-1374, 2017 WL 2884535, at *16 (S.D.W. Va. \nJuly 6, 2017) (finding “no evidence of chicanery” in the circumstances surrounding the settlement \nand noting counsel’s “abundance of experience” and the advanced stage of the litigation).   \nFurthermore,  this  is  not  a  class  action  case  where  there  is  any  danger  of  counsel \ncompromising a suit for an inadequate amount for the sake of ensuring a fee.  Class counsel are \nrepresenting the named Plaintiffs and the class on a pro bono basis.  Moreover, the named Plaintiffs \nand the class members are not seeking any monetary damages, nor does the Settlement Agreement \nprovide for any award of damages. \n2.  The Settlement Agreement is Adequate      \nThe Fourth Circuit has identified the following factors for assessing the “adequacy” of a \nclass action settlement: (1) the relative strength of the plaintiffs’ case on the merits; (2) the \nexistence of any difficulties of proof or strong defenses the plaintiffs are likely to encounter if the \n  18 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-1     Filed 07/30/24     Page 22 of 27\n \ncase goes to trial; (3) the anticipated duration and expense of additional litigation; and (4) the \ndegree of opposition to the settlement.3  Lumber Liquidators, 952 F.3d at 484.  Each factor supports \na preliminary finding that the Settlement Agreement here is adequate. \nFirst, the relative strength of Plaintiffs’ case on the merits is reflected in the Court’s \nprevious grant of a TRO and preliminary injunction with respect to certain claims.  In granting a \nTRO, the Court found Plaintiffs likely to succeed on the merits of their claims that Defendants had \nboth failed to consider children’s reliance interests and violated APA procedure.  ECF No. 54 at \n10-13.  Further, in expanding the preliminary injunction, the Court found Plaintiffs would likely \nsucceed on the merits of the arguments against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) \nadvocacy for USCIS jurisdiction and USCIS deference to immigration judges’ unaccompanied \nchild redeterminations for class members in removal proceedings.  ECF No. 143 at 44-45, 49-50. \nThe second adequacy “factor” is “the existence of any difficulties of proof or strong \ndefenses the plaintiffs are likely to encounter if the case goes to trial.”   Lumber Liquidators, 952 \nF.3d at 484.  As explained above, Plaintiffs believe they have a strong likelihood of prevailing on \nthe merits, either at summary judgment or at trial, but acknowledge that uncertainty remains as to \na final outcome if the case were litigated to a final decision.  Supra Section V.A.   Furthermore, \nappellate action entails prolonged timelines.  This uncertainty supports the adequacy of the \nSettlement Agreement as a reasonable resolution of Plaintiffs’ and the class members’ claims.   \nThird, “the anticipated duration and expense of additional litigation” further supports the \nadequacy of the agreement.  As explained above, continuing to litigate this case would likely result \n \n3 The Fourth Circuit’s Lumber Liquidators decision also refers to “the solvency of the defendant[] \nand the likelihood of recovery on a litigated judgment” as factors in evaluating the adequacy of a \nsettlement agreement.  Lumber Liquidators, 952 F.3d at 484.  These factors are not relevant here, \nbecause no monetary relief will be distributed to class members. \n  19 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-1     Filed 07/30/24     Page 23 of 27\n \nin significant delays, potentially for several years, in class members whose cases USCIS has \nrejected or placed on hold being able to have USCIS recognize jurisdiction over their asylum \napplication and adjudicate it on the merits.  Supra Section V.A.  As a result of the settlement, class \nmembers will be allowed to have their asylum applications heard on the merits without further \ndelay.   \nFinally, as to the last factor, there is currently no opposition to the Settlement Agreement.  \nAs explained above, class counsel and Defendants have negotiated a compromise agreement \nthrough extensive arm’s-length negotiations, ultimately supervised by Chief Magistrate Judge \nSullivan.  If any class member objects to the agreement after notice is provided, the parties will \nreassess this factor, but at this stage, preliminary approval is warranted. \nVI.  THE CLASS DEFINITION SHOULD BE AMENDED \nThe parties request amending the class definition to clarify the date when an asylum \napplicant must file their application in order to fall within the class.  As explained above (supra \nSection III.A), pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, USCIS will issue a memorandum, no later \nthan 90 days after the Court’s final approval of the agreement, that will explain and implement the \nSettlement Agreement.  Ex. 1, III(A).  This superseding memorandum will apply to class members, \nand will remain in effect for at least three years from the superseding memorandum’s effective \ndate.  Id.  The certified class definition extends class membership to individuals who file an asylum \napplication before the effective date “of a lawfully promulgated policy altering the policy set forth \nin the 2013 Kim Memorandum.”  The proposed amended definition specifies that the effective \ndate of USCIS’ superseding memorandum will serve as the cutoff date for class membership.  The \namended definition thus clarifies the date by which an individual must file their asylum application \nwith USCIS in order to be a class member.   \n  20 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-1     Filed 07/30/24     Page 24 of 27\n \n“Even after a certification order is entered, the [Court] remains free to modify [the class \ndefinition] in the light of subsequent developments in the litigation.”  Bezek v. First Nat’l Bank of \nPa., No. 17-2902, 2023 WL 8622604, at *3 (D. Md. Dec. 13, 2023).  The requested change to the \nclass definition does not alter the reasoning underlying the Court's prior Order granting class \ncertification, and therefore, the Court may adopt the amended definition and preliminarily approve \nthe Settlement Agreement.  See, e.g., Foster v. Adams & Assoc., No. 18-02723, 2021 WL 4924849, \nat *3 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 21, 2021). \nVII.  THE  PLAN  FOR  PROVIDING  NOTICE  TO  CLASS  MEMBERS  SATISFIES \nRULE 23  \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e)(1) requires the Court to “direct notice in a reasonable \nmanner to all class members who would be bound” by the proposed settlement.  The form of notice \nis “adequate if it may be understood by the average class member.” In re Titanium Dioxide \nAntitrust Litig., No. 10-0318, 2013 WL 5182093, at *5 (D. Md. Sept. 12, 2013).  Further, under \nFederal Rule Civil Procedure 23(c)(2)(B), this Court must “direct to the class members the best \nnotice practicable under the circumstances.” Amchem Prods. Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 617 \n(1997).  The proposed Class Notice, and plan for distributing the notice, here fulfills these \nrequirements.   \nAs set forth in the proposed Class Notice, class members will receive a summary (in both \nEnglish and Spanish) of the various provisions of the Settlement Agreement, as well as links to \nwebsites containing the full terms of the agreement.  Ex. C to Ex. 1.  The Class Notice will also be \nsufficiently disseminated, as the Class Notice is designed to reach a high percentage of settlement \nclass members.  The Class Notice will be posted on the USCIS and ICE websites, as well as \nPlaintiffs’ non-profit counsels’ websites.  Ex. 1, IV(E).   Class counsel will also distribute the Class \nNotice (in English and Spanish), including a copy of the Settlement Agreement, on e-mail and/or \n  21 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-1     Filed 07/30/24     Page 25 of 27\n \nlist-serv mailing lists for legal services providers.  Id.  Furthermore, USCIS’s Office of Public \nAffairs will email the Class Notice (in English and Spanish), including a copy of the Settlement \nAgreement, to its approximately 47,000 subscribed users.  The Class Notice, and plan  for \ndistribution, therefore satisfies Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  In re Titanium Dioxide Antitrust Litig., \n2013 WL 5182093, at *5. \nVIII.  CONCLUSION \n \nFor the foregoing reasons, the parties respectfully request that the Court preliminarily \napprove the Settlement Agreement; amend the Class Definition; approve the Class Notice; direct \nthat notice be provided to the Class as proposed in section IV(E) of the Settlement Agreement; and \nschedule a Fairness Hearing.\n  22 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-1     Filed 07/30/24     Page 26 of 27\nDated: July 29, 2024 \nRespectfully submitted, \n/s/ Brian T.

D.H.S. et al. \nDistrict of Maryland \nCivil Action No. 8:19-CV-01944-SAG \n \nPlaintiffs J.O.P., M.E.R.E., K.A.R.C., E.D.G., and L.M.Z. (the “Named Plaintiffs”), and \nthe Class (defined in Section II of this Settlement Agreement) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”), and \nDefendants U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”); Alejandro Mayorkas, in his official \ncapacity  as  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security;  U.S.  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Services \n(“USCIS”); Ur Mendoza Jaddou, in her official capacity as Director of USCIS; U.S. Immigration \nand Customs Enforcement (“ICE”); and  Patrick J. Lechleitner, in his official capacity as ICE \nDeputy  Director  and  Senior  Official  Performing  the  Duties  of  the  Director  (collectively, \n“Defendants”) (together with the Plaintiffs, the “Parties”), by and through their attorneys, hereby \nenter into this Settlement Agreement, as of the date it is executed by all Parties hereto and effective \nupon final approval of the Court pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \n \nI.  RECITALS \nA.  On July 1, 2019, Plaintiffs J.O.P., M.A.L.C., M.E.R.E., and K.A.R.C. commenced this \nlitigation for declaratory and injunctive relief (the “Action”) based on allegations that \nUSCIS had adopted policies, as reflected in the May 31, 2019 memorandum titled \n“Updated  Procedures  for  Asylum  Applications  Filed  by  Unaccompanied  Alien \nChildren”  (“2019  Redetermination  Memo”),  that  changed  how  USCIS  would \nimplement protections provided to Unaccompanied Alien Children (“UAC”) under the \nWilliam Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (“TVPRA”), \nwhich policies were contrary to the TVPRA, and violative of the Administrative \nProcedure Act (“APA”) and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the \nU.S. Constitution.  Under the 2019 Redetermination Memo, a child in immigration \ncourt removal proceedings who had previously been determined to be a UAC and who \napplied for asylum after turning 18 or reunifying with a parent or legal guardian would \nhave their asylum application rejected by USCIS for lack of jurisdiction.  The 2019 \nRedetermination Memo also directed that a child previously determined to be a UAC \nwould be subject to the One-Year Deadline for filing asylum applications—a deadline \nfrom which UACs are statutorily exempt—if they applied for asylum after turning 18 \nor reunifying with a parent or legal guardian. \n \nB.  The Court entered a temporary restraining order on August 2, 2019, and converted it to \na preliminary injunction on October 15, 2019, enjoining and restraining Defendants, \nduring the pendency of the litigation, from (i) applying the policy set forth in the 2019 \nRedetermination Memo, to bar individuals previously determined to be UACs from \nseeking asylum before USCIS; and (ii) rejecting jurisdiction over the application of any \nUAC (as defined in the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. § 279(g)(2)) under the \nTVPRA  whose  application  would  have  been  accepted  under  the  USCIS  policy \npredating the 2019 Redetermination Memo.  The Court also ordered Defendant USCIS \nto retract any adverse decision already rendered in an individual case applying the 2019 \n1 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-2     Filed 07/30/24     Page 3 of 52\nRedetermination Memo and reinstate consideration of such case applying the 2013 \nUAC Memorandum (also known as the 2013 Kim Memo).  \n \nC.  On December 20, 2019, Plaintiffs J.O.P., M.A.L.C., M.E.R.E., K.A.R.C., and E.D.G. \nfiled an amended complaint that included their prior allegations and also alleged, inter \nalia,  that  USCIS  had  adopted  an  unlawful  policy,  as  reflected  in  the  2019 \nRedetermination  Memo,  to  defer  to  a  determination  by  an  Executive  Office  for \nImmigration  Review  (“EOIR”)  immigration  judge  that  USCIS  does  not  have \njurisdiction over an asylum application because it was not one filed by a UAC.   \n \nD.  On December 21, 2020, the Court entered an amended preliminary injunction, such \nthat Defendants, during the pendency of this litigation, are “(1) enjoined and restrained \nfrom relying on the policies set forth in the 2019 [Redetermination Memo] as a basis \nto decline jurisdiction over asylum applications of individuals previously determined \nto be unaccompanied alien children (“UACs”), to subject an asylum applicant to the \none-year time limit for filing described at 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B), or for any other \npurpose; (2) enjoined and restrained from rejecting jurisdiction over any asylum \napplication filed by Plaintiffs and members of the class whose applications would have \nbeen accepted under the 2013 Kim Memo; (3) enjoined and restrained from deferring \nto EOIR determinations in assessing jurisdiction over asylum applications filed by \nPlaintiffs and members of the proposed class; and (4) enjoined and restrained during \nthe removal proceedings of any Plaintiff or member of the class (including EOIR \nproceedings before immigration judges and members of the Board of Immigration \nAppeals) from seeking denials of continuances or other postponements in order to await \nadjudication of an asylum application that has been filed with USCIS, from seeking \nEOIR  exercise  of  jurisdiction  over  any  asylum  claim  where  USCIS  has  initial \njurisdiction under the terms of the 2013 Kim Memo, or from otherwise taking a position \nin such individual’s removal proceedings that, inconsistent with the 2013 Kim Memo, \nUSCIS does not have initial jurisdiction over the individual’s asylum application.”  The \nCourt also ordered Defendant USCIS to “retract any adverse decision rendered on or \nafter June 30, 2019 that is based in whole or in part on any of the actions enjoined and \nrestrained by (1), (2), or (3) above.” \n \nE.  On December 21, 2020, pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure, the Court certified the following Class:  \n \nAll  individuals  nationwide  who  prior  to  the  effective  date  of  a  lawfully \npromulgated policy prospectively altering the policy set forth in the 2013 Kim \nMemorandum (1) were determined to be an Unaccompanied Alien Child; and \n(2) who filed an asylum application that was pending with the United States \nCitizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”); and (3) on the date they filed \ntheir asylum application with USCIS, were 18 years of age or older, or had a \nparent or legal guardian in the United States who is available to provide care \nand  physical  custody;  and  (4)  for  whom  USCIS  has  not  adjudicated  the \nindividual’s asylum application on the merits. \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-2     Filed 07/30/24     Page 4 of 52\nF.  On January 11, 2021, Plaintiffs J.O.P., M.A.L.C., M.E.R.E., K.A.R.C., E.D.G., \nand  L.M.Z.  filed  a  second  amended  complaint  that  included  their  prior \nallegations and also alleged, inter alia, that USCIS had adopted an unlawful \npolicy or practice of treating recognitions or notations as to evidence that a child \nhas turned 18 or been reunited with a parent or legal guardian as “affirmative \nacts” under the 2013 Kim Memo. \n \nG. On February 19, 2021, Defendants filed an appeal from the Court’s December \n21, 2020 Order with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. \n \nH. On March 4, 2021, Defendants agreed as follows:  that USCIS will not make \njurisdictional determinations under INA § 208(b)(3)(C) that rely solely on a \nUAC redetermination noted in ENFORCE Alien Removal Module (“EARM”) \nor other ICE or DHS systems as terminating a prior UAC Determination, unless \nit documents that ICE placed the individual in ICE custody as an adult detainee; \nand that while this agreement remains in effect, USCIS will place on hold cases \ninvolving any other type of act that might qualify under the 2013 Kim Memo \nas an “affirmative act” before filing.   \n \nI.  The Parties, through counsel, have conducted discussions and arm’s length \nnegotiations regarding a compromise and settlement of the Action with a view \nto settling all matters in dispute.  \n \nJ.  Considering the benefits that the Class (including Named Plaintiffs) will receive \nfrom settlement of the Action and the risks of litigation, counsel for the Class \n(“Class  Counsel”)  have  concluded  that  the  terms  and  conditions  of  this \nSettlement Agreement are fair, reasonable, adequate, equitable, and in the best \ninterests of the Class. \n \nNOW, THEREFORE, in recognition that the Parties and the interests of justice are best \nserved by concluding this Action, subject to the Court’s approval and entry of an order \nconsistent  with  this  Agreement,  the  undersigned  Parties,  through  counsel,  hereby \nSTIPULATE and AGREE as follows: \n \nII.

AGREED UPON TERMS \n \nA.  USCIS has fully rescinded the 2019 Redetermination Memo. USCIS labelled the \nwebsite with the 2019 Redetermination Memo with a banner stating the memo is no \nlonger current.  USCIS will also issue a superseding memorandum explaining and \nimplementing this Settlement Agreement no later than 90 days after the Court’s final \napproval of this Settlement Agreement. The superseding memorandum’s effective date \nwill be 90 days after the Court’s final approval of this Settlement Agreement. The \nsuperseding memorandum will apply to Class Members as well as other individuals \nwith Prior UAC Determinations who file an asylum application when the memorandum \nis in effect. The superseding memorandum will remain in effect for at least three years \nfrom the superseding memorandum’s effective date. \n \nB.  USCIS will exercise Initial Jurisdiction over Class Members’ asylum applications in \naccordance with the terms of this Settlement Agreement and adjudicate them on the \nmerits, and USCIS will hold such applications exempt from the One-Year Deadline. \n \nC.  1.  Notwithstanding  Paragraph  III.B  of  this  Settlement  Agreement,  USCIS  may \ndetermine it lacks Initial Jurisdiction over the asylum application of a Class Member if \nthe Class Member was placed in adult immigration detention after a Prior UAC \nDetermination but before filing their asylum application. “Placed in adult immigration \ndetention” does not include custody for the sole purposes of processing the Class \nMember  prior  to  release  on  their  own  recognizance  or  release  through  another \nalternative to detention, such as an order of supervision, parole, enrollment in an \nalternative  to  detention  program,  or  ICE  bond. The  Class  Member  must  submit \nevidence of a Prior UAC Determination that USCIS may adopt. If the individual had \ncontact  with  ICE  as  an  adult,  they  may  also  submit  evidence  of  any  custodial \ndeterminations made by ICE after they attained 18 years of age, including but not \nlimited to the Class Member’s declaration made in accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 1746.   \n \n2.  When USCIS declines Initial Jurisdiction based on this provision, USCIS must \nprovide the Class Member and counsel, if any, with: (a) the jurisdictional rejection; (b) \na detailed description of the information leading USCIS to believe that the Class \nMember was placed in adult immigration detention; and (c) an opportunity to rebut the \ninformation within 30 days (or 33 days if the rejection and accompanying detailed \ndescription are served by mail). USCIS shall simultaneously provide the Class Member \nand counsel, if any, with Class Counsel’s contact information, using the language found \nat Exhibit A. USCIS shall retract the jurisdictional rejection within 30 days of having \n6 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-2     Filed 07/30/24     Page 8 of 52\nreceived the Class Member’s rebuttal if the Class Member has successfully rebutted \nthe information USCIS relied upon to reject Initial Jurisdiction.  \n \n3.  For Class Members who fall within this paragraph due to USCIS’s rejection of \nInitial Jurisdiction and whose applications could otherwise be deemed untimely, DHS \ngenerally will agree to stipulate in their removal proceedings that the Class Member \nqualifies for an extraordinary circumstances exception under 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(D), \n8 C.F.R. § 208.4(a)(5), and has filed within a reasonable period given the circumstances \nunder 8 C.F.R. § 208.4(a)(5) for purposes of the One-Year Deadline such that the One-\nYear Deadline does not bar the asylum application. \n \nD.  In assessing its jurisdiction over asylum applications filed by a Class Member, USCIS \nwill  not  defer  to  any  determinations  by  EOIR,  including  but  not  limited  to \ndeterminations made pursuant to Matter of M-A-C-O-, 27 I&N Dec. 477 (BIA 2018).  \nNotwithstanding  the  previous  sentence,  USCIS  may  adopt  a  previous  EOIR \ndetermination that a Class Member was a UAC at the time of filing their asylum \napplication  for  purposes  of  USCIS’s  accepting  Initial  Jurisdiction  over  a  Class \nMember’s asylum application. \n \nE.  1.  Defendants shall retract any Adverse Jurisdictional Determinations rendered on or \nafter June 30, 2019 that merit retraction under the process described in Paragraph \nIII.C.2 no later than 240 days after USCIS’s issuance of the superseding memorandum \ndescribed in Paragraph III.A.  \n \n2.  Defendants shall retract all other Adverse Jurisdictional Determinations rendered \non or after June 30, 2019 that are inconsistent with Paragraphs III.B and/or III.D no \nlater than 180 days after USCIS’s issuance of the superseding memorandum described \nin Paragraph III.A. \n \n3.  No later than 60 days after the Effective Date, Defendants shall mail to Class \nMembers whose cases will be reviewed under this paragraph a notice of re-examination \nof  jurisdictional  determination  indicating  that  USCIS  will  make  a  jurisdictional \ndetermination in the case pursuant to this Settlement Agreement. Defendants shall \ninclude in the notice Class Counsel’s contact information, using the language found at \nExhibit A. \n \nF.  No  later  than  60  days  after  USCIS’s  issuance  of  the  superseding  memorandum \ndescribed in Paragraph III.A of this Settlement Agreement, Defendants shall release \nthe  holds  placed  beginning  in  March  2021  on  certain  Class  Members’  asylum \napplications involving acts that in USCIS’s view might have qualified under the 2013 \nKim Memo as an affirmative act before filing and shall mail to such Class Members a \nnotice that their asylum application has been released from the hold. Defendants shall \ninclude in the notice Class Counsel’s contact information, using the language found at \nExhibit A. \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-2     Filed 07/30/24     Page 9 of 52\nG.  Defendants will adopt procedures permitting Class Members to request that USCIS \nexercise its discretion to expedite adjudication of asylum applications pending with \nUSCIS on the basis of circumstances that include but need not be limited to: \n \n1.  The Class Member’s immigration detention; \n \n2.  The Class Member received a Notice of Lack of Jurisdiction that was \nretracted  under  Paragraph  III.C  or  Paragraph  III.E  of  this  Settlement \nAgreement; or  \n \n3.  The Class Member has an order of removal. \n \nAll  Class  Members,  including  Class  Members  whose  asylum  applications  were \nreleased from hold pursuant to Paragraph III.F of this Settlement Agreement, may also \navail themselves of the general expedite procedures available at their local asylum \noffices.   \n \nH.  With respect to DHS’s treatment of Class Members in removal proceedings, DHS will \nrefrain from taking the position that USCIS does not have Initial Jurisdiction over a \nClass Member’s asylum application. DHS will join or non-oppose Class Members’ \nmotion(s)  for  a  continuance,  administrative  closure  unless  unavailable  under \ncontrolling law in a particular jurisdiction, and, where available, assignment of cases \nto the EOIR status docket, that have been filed or made orally on the record in \nimmigration proceedings in order to await USCIS exercise of Initial Jurisdiction over \ntheir asylum application. Nothing in this provision prevents DHS from either filing a \nmotion to dismiss or terminate removal proceedings of a Class Member to await \nUSCIS’s  adjudication  of  the  asylum  application  or  as  a  matter  of  prosecutorial \ndiscretion,  or  from  joining  or  non-opposing  a  motion  to  dismiss  or  terminate \nproceedings filed or made orally on the record by a Class Member. DHS will generally \njoin or non-oppose Class Members’ motion(s) to dismiss or terminate filed or otherwise \nmade in order to await USCIS exercise of Initial Jurisdiction over their asylum \napplication. Defendants retain discretion to oppose Class Members’ motion(s) if it \ndeems such opposition warranted based on the individual facts of the cases, as long as \nDHS’s opposition is not based, in whole or in part, on a position that USCIS does not \nhave Initial Jurisdiction over the Class Member’s asylum application. Pursuant to this \nparagraph, Defendants agree that in cases where DHS chooses not to file any response \nwith EOIR indicating its position on the Class Members’ properly served motions for \ncontinuance, dismissal or termination, administrative closure unless unavailable under \ncontrolling  law  in  a  particular  jurisdiction,  adjournments  or,  where  available, \nassignment of cases to the EOIR status docket, this provision of the Settlement \nAgreement serves as evidence of DHS’s non-opposition.  \n \nI.  With respect to any Class Member with a final removal order, ICE will refrain from \nexecuting  the  Class  Member’s  final  removal  order  until  USCIS  issues  a  Final \nDetermination  on  one  properly  filed  asylum  application  under  the  terms  of  this \nAgreement. In order to comply with this provision, ICE Enforcement and Removal \n8 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-2     Filed 07/30/24     Page 10 of 52\nOperations (ERO), the agency responsible for executing removal orders, will make an \nentry indicating there is a stay in its system of records for all identified Class Members, \nincluding Class Members identified by USCIS. This alert will not be removed from \nany individual case until such time as USCIS indicates it is appropriate to remove it.    \n \nJ.  Following a grant of asylum by USCIS to a Class Member with a removal order:  \n \n1.  Defendants agree that, where DHS has chosen not to file a response to a \nproperly filed and served Class Member’s motion to reopen, this provision \nof the Settlement Agreement serves as evidence of DHS’s non-opposition \nto the motion filed on behalf of a Class Member described in this section. \nTo avoid the time and number bars for motions to reopen, Defendants agree \nthat Class Members may style their motions to reopen as a “joint motion to \nreopen” and include language that “Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement \nin J.O.P. v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security, No. 19-01944 (D. Md.), \nDHS is joining in the motion unless DHS files a response within 30 days \nopposing the motion.” DHS will generally join or not oppose a motion to \nreopen. The use of this provision of the Settlement Agreement as evidence \nof  joinder  is  solely  limited  to  DHS’s  joinder  for  the  purposes  of \nacknowledging  class  membership  and  the  terms  of  the  Settlement \nAgreement, and as a factor for the applicability of any time or number bars \nthat may otherwise apply to the motion. This provision may not be used for \nany other purpose. The Defendants agree that any opposition to the motion \nto reopen will not be based on a position that USCIS did not have Initial \nJurisdiction  over  the  Class  Member’s  asylum  application.  The  joinder \nframework found in this paragraph only applies to motions to reopen and \nshall have no effect on any combination or concurrently filed motions, e.g., \nmotions to reopen and dismiss. \n \n2.  In conjunction with or following reopening of such proceedings, DHS will \ngenerally  join  or  non-oppose  termination  or  dismissal  of  removal \nproceedings, but retains discretion to oppose termination or dismissal if it \ndeems such opposition warranted based on the individual facts of a case, as \nlong as DHS’s opposition is not based, in whole or in part, on a position that \nUSCIS did not have Initial Jurisdiction over the Class Member’s asylum \napplication. \n \n3.  Nothing in this provision prevents DHS from filing an unopposed or joint \nmotion to reopen the removal proceedings of a Class Member described in \nthis section, or from filing an unopposed or joint motion to dismiss or \nterminate proceedings of a Class Member described in this section. \n \nK.  For any provision of this Settlement Agreement wherein DHS will join or non-oppose \nmotions filed or made by Class Members, DHS will join or non-oppose such motions \nwhen they are submitted with sufficient evidence of Class membership. Any one of the \nfollowing documents provides sufficient evidence of Class membership for purposes \n9 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-2     Filed 07/30/24     Page 11 of 52\nof DHS’s obligations to join or non-oppose motions as specified elsewhere in the \nSettlement Agreement.  In its discretion, DHS may treat evidence other than that \nspecified below as sufficient evidence of Class membership.  \n \n1.  A copy of a receipt for an asylum application filed pursuant to INA § \n208(b)(3)(C); \n \n2.  A copy of an asylum application cover letter sent to USCIS, along with a \nscreenprint of the USCIS Case Status Online tool reflecting that USCIS has \naccepted the application for processing; or \n \n3.  A declaration made in accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 1746 stating that the \nindividual was determined to be a UAC, filed an asylum application with \nUSCIS that USCIS has not adjudicated on the merits, and on the date they \nfiled their asylum application with USCIS they were 18 years of age or \nolder, or had a parent or legal guardian in the United States available to \nprovide care and physical custody. \nIV.

Fairness Hearing. At the fairness hearing, as required for final approval of the \nsettlement pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e)(2), the Parties will jointly \nrequest that the Court approve the Settlement Agreement as fair, final, reasonable, \nadequate, and binding on the Class, all Class Members, and all Plaintiffs; and issue a \nFinal Approval Order, substantially in the form of Exhibit D. \n \nE.

The Parties \nwill have 14 days following the objection period in which to submit answers to any \nobjections that are filed. \n \nG. Opt-Outs.  Due to the nature of the relief offered to the Class Members, there are no \ngrounds for Class Members to opt-out.   \n \n11 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-2     Filed 07/30/24     Page 13 of 52\nH.

The \nCourt has carefully considered the settlement agreement (the “Agreement”) together with all \nexhibits thereto (annexed to the Parties’ motion as Exhibit 1), all the filings related to the instant \nmotion, and the record in this case.  The Court hereby gives its preliminary approval of this \nsettlement;  finds  that  the  Agreement  is  sufficiently  fair,  reasonable,  and  adequate  to  allow \ndissemination of notice of the Agreement (“Class Notice”) to the certified Class, as amended \nherein, and to hold a Fairness Hearing; orders the Class Notice be made available to the certified \nClass, as amended herein, in accordance with the Agreement and this Order; and schedules a \nFairness Hearing to determine whether the proposed settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable.   \n \n \n1 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-2     Filed 07/30/24     Page 23 of 52\n \n \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT: \n1.

The Court previously certified the class as “All individuals nationwide who prior \nto the effective date of a lawfully promulgated policy prospectively altering the policy set forth in \nthe 2013 Kim Memorandum (1) were determined to be an Unaccompanied Alien Child; and (2) \nwho  filed  an  asylum  application  that  was  pending  with  the  United  States  Citizenship  and \nImmigration Services (“USCIS”); and (3) on the date they filed their asylum application with \nUSCIS, were 18 years of age or older, or had a parent or legal guardian in the United States who \nis available to provide care and physical custody; and (4) for whom USCIS has not adjudicated the \nindividual’s asylum application on the merits.” \n4.  The Parties agree, as set forth in the Agreement, that the definition of the certified \nClass should be amended as follows:  “All individuals nationwide who prior to the effective date \nof  the  superseding  memorandum  discussed  in  Section  III(A)  [of  the  Agreement]:  (1)  were \ndetermined to be a UAC; and (2) who filed an asylum application that was pending with USCIS; \nand (3) on the date they filed their asylum application with USCIS, were 18 years of age or older, \nor had a parent or legal guardian in the United States who is available to provide care and physical \n2 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-2     Filed 07/30/24     Page 24 of 52\n \ncustody; and (4) for whom USCIS has not adjudicated the individual’s asylum application on the \nmerits.”  The Court adopts the parties’ amended Class definition as set forth in the Agreement. \n5.  The Court finds that the proposed Class Notice and the proposed plan of distribution \nof the Class Notice meet the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e)(1) and hereby \ndirects the parties to proceed with the notice distribution in accordance with the terms of the \nAgreement.  Distribution of the Class Notice must be completed within 14 days of this Order. \n6.  The Court also approves the procedures set forth in Section IV(F) of the Agreement \nfor any objections to the settlement.  Any Class Member who wishes to object to the Agreement \nmust do so within 60 days of this Order.  The Parties will have 14 days following the objection \nperiod in which to submit answers to any objections that are filed. \n7.  The Court directs that a hearing be held on ____, 2024 (the “Fairness Hearing”) to \nassist the Court in finally determining whether the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate; and \nwhether Final Judgment should be entered dismissing with prejudice the claims in the above-\ncaptioned case but retaining jurisdiction in this Court to interpret and enforce the Agreement for \nits duration and to resolve any request for attorneys’ fees and costs.   \n8.  If the Agreement is not finally approved, then (a) all parties will proceed as if the \nAgreement had not been executed and this order not entered, preserving in that event all of their \nrespective claims and defenses in this action; and (b) all releases given will be null and void.  In \nsuch an event, this Court’s orders regarding the Agreement, including this Order, shall not be used \nor referred to in litigation for any purpose.  Nothing in this paragraph is intended to alter the terms \nof the Agreement with respect to the effect of the Agreement if not approved. \n9.

U.S. Department of Homeland Security, et al., Case No. 19-cv-\n01944-SAG, pending in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. \nThe  Court  has  granted  preliminary  approval  of  the  proposed  Settlement \nAgreement and has set a Final Approval Hearing (referred to as a Fairness Hearing \nin the proposed Settlement Agreement) to take place on [DATE] at [TIME] in \nCourtroom [X], [ADDRESS], to decide if the proposed Settlement Agreement is fair, \nreasonable, and adequate.  \n \nFinal Approval Hearing: \n  [DATE] at [TIME]   \n \nNote: this date and time are subject to change by Court Order and may change \nwithout further notice to the Class. \n1. What is the purpose of this notice? \nThis notice has three purposes. The notice:  \nA.  Tells you about the proposed Settlement Agreement and the Final \nApproval Hearing;  \nB.  Explains how you may object—and the deadline for doing so—if you \ndisagree with the proposed Settlement Agreement’s terms; and \nC.  Explains how you can get more information. \n \nIf you are a Class Member, your legal \nrights are affected regardless of \nwhether you act. \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-2     Filed 07/30/24     Page 29 of 52\n2. What is the J.O.P. v. DHS lawsuit about? \n \nJ.O.P. v. DHS is a class action lawsuit that was filed in federal court in Maryland in \nJuly 2019. A class action lawsuit is filed on behalf of a large group of people, rather \nthan one person.  \n \nThe Plaintiffs who brought the J.O.P. v. DHS lawsuit claimed that a 2019 policy \ncreated by the federal government about how to treat asylum applications filed by \npeople previously determined to be an “Unaccompanied Child” (referred to as \n“Unaccompanied Alien Child” in the immigration laws) was unlawful.  \n \nUnder that 2019 policy, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) rejected \nthe asylum applications of people in immigration court removal proceedings who \nhad “Unaccompanied Child” determinations if they no longer met the definition of \n“Unaccompanied Child” on the date they filed the asylum application—even though \nunder the policy that came before the 2019 policy, USCIS accepted such \napplications.  \n \nUnder the challenged 2019 policy, USCIS also applied a one-year filing deadline to \nthe asylum applications of individuals with previous “Unaccompanied Child” \ndeterminations if they no longer met the definition of “Unaccompanied Child” on \nthe date they filed their asylum application—even though under the policy in place \nbefore the 2019 policy, USCIS held such applications exempt from the one-year \ndeadline.  \n \nThe Parties in this case are Plaintiffs J.O.P., M.E.R.E., K.A.R.C., E.D.G., and L.M.Z., all \nasylum seekers with previous “Unaccompanied Child” determinations (“Plaintiffs”), \nand the Defendants are U.S. Department of Homeland Security; Alejandro \nMayorkas, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security; U.S. Citizenship \nand Immigration Services; Ur Mendoza Jaddou, Director of U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement; and Patrick J. \nLechleitner, ICE Deputy Director and Senior Official Performing the Duties of the \nDirector (“the Government”). \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-2     Filed 07/30/24     Page 30 of 52\nSince August of 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland (“Court”) \nhas ordered the Government to stop applying the 2019 policy. On December 21, \n2020, the Court decided that this case could go forward as a nationwide class \naction.  \n \nThe certified class includes all people nationwide who were determined to be an \n“Unaccompanied Child,” filed an asylum application with USCIS that USCIS has not \nyet adjudicated on the merits, and on the date they filed the application were 18 \nyears old or older or had a parent or legal guardian in the United States available to \nprovide care and physical custody.  \n \nThe Court also ordered the Government not to advocate against postponements of \nthe immigration court proceedings of Class Members while they were waiting for \nUSCIS to decide their pending asylum applications. \n \nThe Plaintiffs and the Government subsequently reached this Settlement \nAgreement. The Government denies any wrongdoing, but is settling the case in \norder to avoid the expense and resources to keep fighting the case. The Plaintiffs \nand their lawyers (“Class Counsel”) believe that the proposed Settlement \nAgreement provides important rights and benefits for the Class, and that it is in the \nbest interest of the Class to settle the case, while avoiding the expense and delay of \ncontinuing to fight the case in court. The Court has preliminarily approved the \nSettlement Agreement.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-2     Filed 07/30/24     Page 31 of 52\n3. How do I know if I am part of the class? \n     The Court has certified the following class for purposes of this \nSettlement Agreement (the “Class”): “all individuals nationwide who \nprior to the date that is 90 days after the date of the Court’s final \napproval of this Settlement Agreement  \n  (1) were determined to be an [Unaccompanied Child]; and  \n  (2) who filed an asylum application that was pending with \nUSCIS; and  \n  (3) on the date they filed their asylum application with USCIS, \nwere 18 years of age or older, or had a parent or legal \nguardian in the United States who is available to provide care \nand physical custody; and  \n  (4) for whom USCIS has not adjudicated the individual’s \nasylum application on the merits.”  \n \n \nIn other words, you are part of the Class covered by the Settlement Agreement \n(“Class Member”) if, before the date that is 90 days after the date the Court grants \nfinal approval of the Settlement Agreement, you (1) were determined to be an \nUnaccompanied Child; (2) filed an asylum application that was pending with USCIS; \n(3) on the date you filed your asylum application with USCIS, you were 18 years of \nage or older, or you had a parent or legal guardian in the United States who is \navailable to provide care and physical custody; and (4) have not received an \nadjudication from USCIS on the merits of your asylum application. You do not need \nto live in Maryland to be part of the Class and benefit from the proposed \nSettlement Agreement. \n \n \nImportant: So me individuals who were previously \ndetermined to  be Unaccompanied Children but have \n \nnot yet filed for asylum with USCIS can become \n  Class Members if they file an asylum application with \nUSCIS before the deadline described above and meet \nthe other requirements described above. \n5 \n \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-2     Filed 07/30/24     Page 32 of 52\n4. What does the Settlement Agreement provide? \n \nThis notice summarizes the proposed Settlement Agreement. You can learn how to \nget a copy of the full proposed Settlement Agreement in Part 7 below. In brief, under \nthe proposed Settlement Agreement: \n \nA.  USCIS asylum adjudications. Class Members have a right to have USCIS \ndecide their asylum applications on the merits, even if they are in removal \nproceedings, and USCIS will not apply the one-year deadline for ﬁling asylum \napplications to Class Members’ asylum applications. USCIS will decide the \nasylum application even if an Immigration Judge found that the Immigration \nJudge and not USCIS had the power to decide the asylum application. USCIS \nwill decide the asylum application even if an Immigration Judge refuses to \npostpone the immigration court case while the asylum application is pending \nwith USCIS.  \n \n  Limited exception. USCIS can only refuse to decide a Class Member’s \no\nasylum application on the merits if the Class Member was placed in \nimmigration detention as an adult (meaning the person was 18 years \nold or older) before the Class Member ﬁled their asylum application. If \nUSCIS refuses to consider a Class Member’s asylum application \nbecause of the Class Member’s placement in adult immigration \ndetention, the Class Member is entitled to certain protections speciﬁed \nin the proposed Settlement Agreement. \n \nB.  Retractions of previous rejections. USCIS will retract previous rejections of \nthe asylum applications of qualifying Class Members and reinstate them for \nconsideration under this proposed Settlement Agreement. \n \nC.  Expedite process. USCIS will create a process for Class Members in certain \nspeciﬁed urgent circumstances to request that USCIS expedite their cases. \n \n \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-2     Filed 07/30/24     Page 33 of 52\nD. New USCIS memo. USCIS will issue a memo explaining the procedures it is \nagreeing to under the Settlement Agreement. This memo will apply to Class \nMembers and other people who were previously determined by the \nGovernment to be an “Unaccompanied Child.” USCIS will keep this memo in \nplace for at least three years from its eﬀective date. \n \nE.  Motion practice in immigration court. In a Class Member’s removal \nproceedings, the Government lawyer representing the Department of \nHomeland Security will not argue against USCIS’s authority over the Class \nMember’s asylum application. The Government lawyer will generally join or \nnot oppose the Class Member’s request for dismissal of the removal \nproceedings or for a postponement to await USCIS’s decision on the asylum \napplication.  \n \nF.  Stays of removal. ICE will not remove Class Members with ﬁnal orders of \nremoval from the United States while they are waiting for USCIS to decide \ntheir asylum application under the proposed Settlement Agreement. \n \nG. Motions to reopen. If USCIS grants a Class Member asylum and the Class \nMember has a removal order, the Government lawyer who represents the \nDepartment of Homeland Security in the Class Member’s removal \nproceedings will generally not oppose the Class Member’s motion to reopen \ntheir removal case. \n \nH. Time period: The Settlement Agreement will be in eﬀect for a year and a half \n(548 days) after it goes into eﬀect; except that the USCIS memo will remain in \neﬀect for at least three years.   \n \nI.  Suspected violations: While the Settlement Agreement is in eﬀect, if a Class \nMember believes the Government has violated the Settlement Agreement, \nthat Class Member or their counsel may notify Class Counsel in writing of the \nsuspected violation, and the Parties will seek to resolve the issue.   \n \nAll of the terms of the proposed Settlement Agreement are subject to Court \napproval at a “Final Approval Hearing,” discussed below.  \n7 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-2     Filed 07/30/24     Page 34 of 52\n5. What are the procedures for objections by class members? \n \n \n \nIf you are satisfied with the proposed Settlement Agreement, you do \nnot have to do anything. \n \n \nIf you are not satisfied with the proposed Settlement Agreement, you \ndo not have the right to opt out of the Settlement Agreement. \nHowever, you have the right to ask the Court to deny approval of the \nproposed Settlement Agreement by filing a written objection. You \ncannot ask the Court to order a different settlement; the Court can \nonly approve or reject the proposed Settlement Agreement. If the \nCourt denies approval, this lawsuit will continue. If that is what you \nwant to happen, you must object. \n \nAny objection to the proposed Settlement Agreement and/or notice of \nrequest to be heard at the Final Approval Hearing must be in writing \nand must: \nA.  Clearly identify the case name and number: J.O.P. et al. v. U.S. \nDepartment of Homeland Security, et al., Case No. 19-cv-01944; \nB.  Include the Class Member’s name (using only initials if the Class \nMember is under the age of 18), current address, and telephone \nnumber (or current address and telephone number of the Class \nMember’s legal representative); \nC.  State the grounds upon which the claimed Class membership is \nbased; \nD. Include an explanation of why the Class Member objects to the \nproposed Settlement Agreement, including any supporting \ndocumentation;  \nE.  Indicate whether the Class Member requests the opportunity to be \nheard at the Final Approval Hearing;  \nF.  Be served on the Parties and filed with the Court.  \n8 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-2     Filed 07/30/24     Page 35 of 52\n- To serve a notice of objection and/or request to be heard on the \nParties, you must email the document to [X] or mail it to [X]. It must \nbe emailed or postmarked on or before [DATE]; and  \n- To file a notice of objection and/or request to be heard with the \nCourt, you must mail it to [X] Clerk, United States District Court for the \nDistrict of Maryland, Southern Division, [address], or file it in person at \nany location of the United States District Court for the District of \nMaryland. It must be filed in person or postmarked on or before \n[DATE]. \n \nNote: If your objection does not comply with all of the above requirements, the \nCourt can ignore it or deny your request to be heard. \nAny objection or notice of request to be heard can be filed under seal to avoid \ndisclosure of personal identifying information on the public record.   \n \n6. When is the Final Approval Hearing, what is its purpose, and \nwhat are the potential outcomes?  \n \n  WHEN: \n \n \nThe Final Approval Hearing is \n  scheduled for [DATE] at [TIME] in \nCourtroom [X], [ADDRESS].   \n \n \nNote: this date and time are subject to change by Court Order and may change \nwithout further notice to the Class. The purpose of the Final Approval Hearing is \nfor the Court to determine if the Settlement Agreement is fair, reasonable, and \nadequate.  \n \n \n9 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-2     Filed 07/30/24     Page 36 of 52\nIf you file a timely written objection that complies with the \nrequirements listed in Part 5 above, you may, but are not required to, \nappear at the Final Approval Hearing, either in person or through \nyour own attorney. If you appear through your own attorney at the \nFinal Approval Hearing, you are responsible for hiring and paying that \nattorney. \nIf the Court grants final approval of the Settlement Agreement, Class Members \nwill settle the legal claims identified in the Settlement Agreement and agree to \nstop fighting this lawsuit. \nIf the Court does not grant final approval of the proposed Settlement \nAgreement, the proposed Settlement Agreement will be void, and the Parties will \ncontinue to litigate this case in front of the Court. If that happens, there is no \nguarantee that: (1) the Court will rule in favor of the Class Members; (2) a \nfavorable Court decision, if any, would be as favorable to the Class Members as \nthis Settlement Agreement; or (3) any favorable Court decision would be upheld \nif the Government filed an appeal. \n7.

DHS lawsuit claimed that a 2019 policy \ncreated by the federal government about how to treat asylum applications filed by \npeople previously determined to be an “Unaccompanied Child” was unlawful.  \n \nUnder that 2019 policy, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) rejected \nthe asylum applications of people in immigration court removal proceedings who \nhad “Unaccompanied Child” determinations if they no longer met the definition of \n“Unaccompanied Child” on the date they filed the asylum application—even though \nunder the policy that came before the 2019 policy, USCIS accepted such \napplications.  \n \nUnder the challenged 2019 policy, USCIS also applied a one-year filing deadline to \nthe asylum applications of individuals with previous “Unaccompanied Child” \ndeterminations if they no longer met the definition of “Unaccompanied Child” on \nthe date they filed their asylum application—even though under the policy in place \nbefore the 2019 policy, USCIS held such applications exempt from the one-year \ndeadline.  \n \nThe Parties in this case are Plaintiffs J.O.P., M.E.R.E., K.A.R.C., E.D.G., and L.M.Z., all \nasylum seekers with previous “Unaccompanied Child” determinations (“Plaintiffs”), \nand the Defendants are U.S. Department of Homeland Security; Alejandro \nMayorkas, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security; U.S. Citizenship \nand Immigration Services; Ur Mendoza Jaddou, Director of U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement; and Patrick J. \nLechleitner, ICE Deputy Director and Senior Official Performing the Duties of the \nDirector (“the Government”). \n \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-2     Filed 07/30/24     Page 45 of 52\nIn 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland (“Court”) ordered the \nGovernment to stop applying the 2019 policy. On December 21, 2020, the Court \ndecided that this case could go forward as a nationwide class action. The Court also \nordered the Government not to advocate against postponements of the \nimmigration court proceedings of Class Members while they were waiting for USCIS \nto decide their pending asylum applications. The Plaintiffs and the Government \nsubsequently reached a Settlement Agreement, and the Court approved the \nSettlement Agreement on [DATE]. \n \nHow do I know if I am part of the class? \n    You are part of the Class covered by the Settlement Agreement \n(“Class Member”) if, before [DATE], you \n    (1) were determined to be an Unaccompanied Child;  \n    (2) filed an asylum application that was pending with USCIS;  \n    (3) on the date you filed your asylum application with USCIS, you \nwere 18 years of age or older, or you had a parent or legal \nguardian in the United States who is available to provide care and \nphysical custody; and  \n    (4) have not received an adjudication from USCIS on the merits \nof your asylum application. \n \nImportant: \n \n \nSome individuals who were previously determined to \nbe Unaccompanied Children but have not yet filed for \n \nasylum with USCIS can become Class Members if they \nfile an asylum application with USCIS before [DATE] and \n \nmeet the other requirements described above. \n \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-2     Filed 07/30/24     Page 46 of 52\nWhat does the Settlement Agreement provide? \n \nThis notice summarizes the ﬁnal Settlement Agreement. If you want to know more, \nyou should read the Settlement Agreement or talk to your immigration lawyer, if \nyou have one. \n \nIn brief, under the ﬁnal Settlement Agreement: \n \nA.  USCIS asylum adjudications. Class Members have a right to have USCIS \ndecide their asylum applications on the merits, even if they are in removal \nproceedings, and USCIS will not apply the one-year deadline for ﬁling asylum \napplications to Class Members’ asylum applications. USCIS will decide the \nasylum application even if an Immigration Judge found that the Immigration \nJudge and not USCIS had the power to decide the asylum application. USCIS \nwill decide the asylum application even if an Immigration Judge refuses to \npostpone the immigration court case while the asylum application is pending \nwith USCIS.  \n \n  Limited exception. USCIS can only refuse to decide a Class Member’s \no\nasylum application on the merits if the Class Member was placed in \nimmigration detention as an adult (meaning the person was 18 years \nold or older) before the Class Member ﬁled their asylum application. If \nUSCIS refuses to consider a Class Member’s asylum application \nbecause of the Class Member’s placement in adult immigration \ndetention, the Class Member is entitled to certain protections speciﬁed \nin the Settlement Agreement. \n \nB.  Retractions of previous rejections. USCIS will retract previous rejections of \nthe asylum applications of qualifying Class Members and reinstate them for \nconsideration under this Settlement Agreement. \n \nC.  Expedite process. USCIS will create a process for Class Members in certain \nspeciﬁed urgent circumstances to request that USCIS expedite their cases. \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-2     Filed 07/30/24     Page 47 of 52\nD. New USCIS memo. USCIS will issue a memo explaining the procedures it is \nagreeing to under the Settlement Agreement. This memo will apply to Class \nMembers and other people who were previously determined by the \nGovernment to be an “Unaccompanied Child.” USCIS will keep this memo in \nplace for at least three years from its eﬀective date. \n \nE.  Motion practice in immigration court. In a Class Member’s removal \nproceedings, the Government lawyer representing the Department of \nHomeland Security will not argue against USCIS’s authority over the Class \nMember’s asylum application. The Government lawyer will generally join or \nnot oppose the Class Member’s request for dismissal of the removal \nproceedings or for a postponement to await USCIS’s decision on the asylum \napplication.  \n \nF.  Stays of removal. ICE will not remove Class Members with ﬁnal orders of \nremoval from the United States while they are waiting for USCIS to decide \ntheir asylum application under the Settlement Agreement. \n \nG. Motions to reopen. If USCIS grants a Class Member asylum and the Class \nMember has a removal order, the Government lawyer who represents the \nDepartment of Homeland Security in the Class Member’s removal \nproceedings will generally not oppose the Class Member’s motion to reopen \ntheir removal case. \n \nH. Time period: The Settlement Agreement will be in eﬀect for a year and a half \n(548 days) after it goes into eﬀect; except that the USCIS memo will remain in \neﬀect for at least three years.   \n \nI.  Suspected violations:  While the Settlement Agreement is in eﬀect, if a Class \nMember believes the Government has violated the Settlement Agreement, \nthat Class Member or their counsel may notify Class Counsel in writing of the \nsuspected violation, and the Parties will seek to resolve the issue.   \n \n \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-2     Filed 07/30/24     Page 48 of 52\nWhere can I get more information? \nThis notice summarizes the Settlement Agreement.

The \nCourt has carefully considered the settlement agreement (the “Agreement”) together with all \nexhibits thereto (annexed to the Parties’ motion as Exhibit 1), all the filings related to the instant \nmotion, and the record in this case.  The Court hereby gives its preliminary approval of this \nsettlement;  finds  that  the  Agreement  is  sufficiently  fair,  reasonable,  and  adequate  to  allow \ndissemination of notice of the Agreement (“Class Notice”) to the certified Class, as amended \nherein, and to hold a Fairness Hearing; orders the Class Notice be made available to the certified \nClass, as amended herein, in accordance with the Agreement and this Order; and schedules a \nFairness Hearing to determine whether the proposed settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable.   \n \n \n1 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-3     Filed 07/30/24     Page 3 of 5\n \n \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT: \n1.  The Agreement is hereby incorporated by reference in this Order, and all terms or \nphrases used in this Order shall have the same meaning as in the Agreement. \n2.  The Court preliminarily approves the Agreement, provisionally finding that the \nterms of the Agreement are fair, reasonable, and adequate as required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2), \nand within the range of possible approval and sufficient to warrant providing notice to the certified \nClass, as amended herein. \n3.  The Court previously certified the class as “All individuals nationwide who prior \nto the effective date of a lawfully promulgated policy prospectively altering the policy set forth in \nthe 2013 Kim Memorandum (1) were determined to be an Unaccompanied Alien Child; and (2) \nwho  filed  an  asylum  application  that  was  pending  with  the  United  States  Citizenship  and \nImmigration Services (“USCIS”); and (3) on the date they filed their asylum application with \nUSCIS, were 18 years of age or older, or had a parent or legal guardian in the United States who \nis available to provide care and physical custody; and (4) for whom USCIS has not adjudicated the \nindividual’s asylum application on the merits.” \n4.  The Parties agree, as set forth in the Agreement, that the definition of the certified \nClass should be amended as follows:  “All individuals nationwide who prior to the effective date \nof  the  superseding  memorandum  discussed  in  Section  III(A)  [of  the  Agreement]:  (1)  were \ndetermined to be a UAC; and (2) who filed an asylum application that was pending with USCIS; \nand (3) on the date they filed their asylum application with USCIS, were 18 years of age or older, \nor had a parent or legal guardian in the United States who is available to provide care and physical \n2 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-3     Filed 07/30/24     Page 4 of 5\n \ncustody; and (4) for whom USCIS has not adjudicated the individual’s asylum application on the \nmerits.”  The Court adopts the parties’ amended Class definition as set forth in the Agreement. \n5.  The Court finds that the proposed Class Notice and the proposed plan of distribution \nof the Class Notice meet the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e)(1) and hereby \ndirects the parties to proceed with the notice distribution in accordance with the terms of the \nAgreement.  Distribution of the Class Notice must be completed within 14 days of this Order. \n6.  The Court also approves the procedures set forth in Section IV(F) of the Agreement \nfor any objections to the settlement.  Any Class Member who wishes to object to the Agreement \nmust do so within 60 days of this Order.  The Parties will have 14 days following the objection \nperiod in which to submit answers to any objections that are filed. \n7.  The Court directs that a hearing be held on ____, 2024 (the “Fairness Hearing”) to \nassist the Court in finally determining whether the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate; and \nwhether Final Judgment should be entered dismissing with prejudice the claims in the above-\ncaptioned case but retaining jurisdiction in this Court to interpret and enforce the Agreement for \nits duration and to resolve any request for attorneys’ fees and costs.   \n8.  If the Agreement is not finally approved, then (a) all parties will proceed as if the \nAgreement had not been executed and this order not entered, preserving in that event all of their \nrespective claims and defenses in this action; and (b) all releases given will be null and void.  In \nsuch an event, this Court’s orders regarding the Agreement, including this Order, shall not be used \nor referred to in litigation for any purpose.  Nothing in this paragraph is intended to alter the terms \nof the Agreement with respect to the effect of the Agreement if not approved. \n9.  The Parties’ Joint Motion for Preliminary Approval of Proposed Class Action \nSettlement  and  to  Amend  the  Class  Definition  is  hereby  GRANTED.    The  Court  hereby \n3 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-3     Filed 07/30/24     Page 5 of 5\n \npreliminarily approves the proposed class-wide relief set forth in the Agreement, hereby approves \nthe proposed form and plan of notice (addressed in the Agreement), and hereby schedules the \nFairness Hearing.

D.H.S. et al. \nDistrict of Maryland \nCivil Action No. 8:19-CV-01944-SAG \n \nPlaintiffs J.O.P., M.E.R.E., K.A.R.C., E.D.G., and L.M.Z. (the “Named Plaintiffs”), and \nthe Class (defined in Section II of this Settlement Agreement) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”), and \nDefendants U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”); Alejandro Mayorkas, in his official \ncapacity  as  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security;  U.S.  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Services \n(“USCIS”); Ur Mendoza Jaddou, in her official capacity as Director of USCIS; U.S. Immigration \nand Customs Enforcement (“ICE”); and  Patrick J. Lechleitner, in his official capacity as ICE \nDeputy  Director  and  Senior  Official  Performing  the  Duties  of  the  Director  (collectively, \n“Defendants”) (together with the Plaintiffs, the “Parties”), by and through their attorneys, hereby \nenter into this Settlement Agreement, as of the date it is executed by all Parties hereto and effective \nupon final approval of the Court pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \n \nI.  RECITALS \nA.  On July 1, 2019, Plaintiffs J.O.P., M.A.L.C., M.E.R.E., and K.A.R.C. commenced this \nlitigation for declaratory and injunctive relief (the “Action”) based on allegations that \nUSCIS had adopted policies, as reflected in the May 31, 2019 memorandum titled \n“Updated  Procedures  for  Asylum  Applications  Filed  by  Unaccompanied  Alien \nChildren”  (“2019  Redetermination  Memo”),  that  changed  how  USCIS  would \nimplement protections provided to Unaccompanied Alien Children (“UAC”) under the \nWilliam Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (“TVPRA”), \nwhich policies were contrary to the TVPRA, and violative of the Administrative \nProcedure Act (“APA”) and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the \nU.S. Constitution.  Under the 2019 Redetermination Memo, a child in immigration \ncourt removal proceedings who had previously been determined to be a UAC and who \napplied for asylum after turning 18 or reunifying with a parent or legal guardian would \nhave their asylum application rejected by USCIS for lack of jurisdiction.  The 2019 \nRedetermination Memo also directed that a child previously determined to be a UAC \nwould be subject to the One-Year Deadline for filing asylum applications—a deadline \nfrom which UACs are statutorily exempt—if they applied for asylum after turning 18 \nor reunifying with a parent or legal guardian. \n \nB.  The Court entered a temporary restraining order on August 2, 2019, and converted it to \na preliminary injunction on October 15, 2019, enjoining and restraining Defendants, \nduring the pendency of the litigation, from (i) applying the policy set forth in the 2019 \nRedetermination Memo, to bar individuals previously determined to be UACs from \nseeking asylum before USCIS; and (ii) rejecting jurisdiction over the application of any \nUAC (as defined in the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. § 279(g)(2)) under the \nTVPRA  whose  application  would  have  been  accepted  under  the  USCIS  policy \npredating the 2019 Redetermination Memo.  The Court also ordered Defendant USCIS \nto retract any adverse decision already rendered in an individual case applying the 2019 \n1 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-2     Filed 07/30/24     Page 3 of 52\nRedetermination Memo and reinstate consideration of such case applying the 2013 \nUAC Memorandum (also known as the 2013 Kim Memo).  \n \nC.  On December 20, 2019, Plaintiffs J.O.P., M.A.L.C., M.E.R.E., K.A.R.C., and E.D.G. \nfiled an amended complaint that included their prior allegations and also alleged, inter \nalia,  that  USCIS  had  adopted  an  unlawful  policy,  as  reflected  in  the  2019 \nRedetermination  Memo,  to  defer  to  a  determination  by  an  Executive  Office  for \nImmigration  Review  (“EOIR”)  immigration  judge  that  USCIS  does  not  have \njurisdiction over an asylum application because it was not one filed by a UAC.   \n \nD.  On December 21, 2020, the Court entered an amended preliminary injunction, such \nthat Defendants, during the pendency of this litigation, are “(1) enjoined and restrained \nfrom relying on the policies set forth in the 2019 [Redetermination Memo] as a basis \nto decline jurisdiction over asylum applications of individuals previously determined \nto be unaccompanied alien children (“UACs”), to subject an asylum applicant to the \none-year time limit for filing described at 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B), or for any other \npurpose; (2) enjoined and restrained from rejecting jurisdiction over any asylum \napplication filed by Plaintiffs and members of the class whose applications would have \nbeen accepted under the 2013 Kim Memo; (3) enjoined and restrained from deferring \nto EOIR determinations in assessing jurisdiction over asylum applications filed by \nPlaintiffs and members of the proposed class; and (4) enjoined and restrained during \nthe removal proceedings of any Plaintiff or member of the class (including EOIR \nproceedings before immigration judges and members of the Board of Immigration \nAppeals) from seeking denials of continuances or other postponements in order to await \nadjudication of an asylum application that has been filed with USCIS, from seeking \nEOIR  exercise  of  jurisdiction  over  any  asylum  claim  where  USCIS  has  initial \njurisdiction under the terms of the 2013 Kim Memo, or from otherwise taking a position \nin such individual’s removal proceedings that, inconsistent with the 2013 Kim Memo, \nUSCIS does not have initial jurisdiction over the individual’s asylum application.”  The \nCourt also ordered Defendant USCIS to “retract any adverse decision rendered on or \nafter June 30, 2019 that is based in whole or in part on any of the actions enjoined and \nrestrained by (1), (2), or (3) above.” \n \nE.  On December 21, 2020, pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure, the Court certified the following Class:  \n \nAll  individuals  nationwide  who  prior  to  the  effective  date  of  a  lawfully \npromulgated policy prospectively altering the policy set forth in the 2013 Kim \nMemorandum (1) were determined to be an Unaccompanied Alien Child; and \n(2) who filed an asylum application that was pending with the United States \nCitizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”); and (3) on the date they filed \ntheir asylum application with USCIS, were 18 years of age or older, or had a \nparent or legal guardian in the United States who is available to provide care \nand  physical  custody;  and  (4)  for  whom  USCIS  has  not  adjudicated  the \nindividual’s asylum application on the merits. \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-2     Filed 07/30/24     Page 4 of 52\nF.  On January 11, 2021, Plaintiffs J.O.P., M.A.L.C., M.E.R.E., K.A.R.C., E.D.G., \nand  L.M.Z.  filed  a  second  amended  complaint  that  included  their  prior \nallegations and also alleged, inter alia, that USCIS had adopted an unlawful \npolicy or practice of treating recognitions or notations as to evidence that a child \nhas turned 18 or been reunited with a parent or legal guardian as “affirmative \nacts” under the 2013 Kim Memo. \n \nG. On February 19, 2021, Defendants filed an appeal from the Court’s December \n21, 2020 Order with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. \n \nH. On March 4, 2021, Defendants agreed as follows:  that USCIS will not make \njurisdictional determinations under INA § 208(b)(3)(C) that rely solely on a \nUAC redetermination noted in ENFORCE Alien Removal Module (“EARM”) \nor other ICE or DHS systems as terminating a prior UAC Determination, unless \nit documents that ICE placed the individual in ICE custody as an adult detainee; \nand that while this agreement remains in effect, USCIS will place on hold cases \ninvolving any other type of act that might qualify under the 2013 Kim Memo \nas an “affirmative act” before filing.   \n \nI.  The Parties, through counsel, have conducted discussions and arm’s length \nnegotiations regarding a compromise and settlement of the Action with a view \nto settling all matters in dispute.  \n \nJ.  Considering the benefits that the Class (including Named Plaintiffs) will receive \nfrom settlement of the Action and the risks of litigation, counsel for the Class \n(“Class  Counsel”)  have  concluded  that  the  terms  and  conditions  of  this \nSettlement Agreement are fair, reasonable, adequate, equitable, and in the best \ninterests of the Class. \n \nNOW, THEREFORE, in recognition that the Parties and the interests of justice are best \nserved by concluding this Action, subject to the Court’s approval and entry of an order \nconsistent  with  this  Agreement,  the  undersigned  Parties,  through  counsel,  hereby \nSTIPULATE and AGREE as follows: \n \nII.

AGREED UPON TERMS \n \nA.  USCIS has fully rescinded the 2019 Redetermination Memo. USCIS labelled the \nwebsite with the 2019 Redetermination Memo with a banner stating the memo is no \nlonger current.  USCIS will also issue a superseding memorandum explaining and \nimplementing this Settlement Agreement no later than 90 days after the Court’s final \napproval of this Settlement Agreement. The superseding memorandum’s effective date \nwill be 90 days after the Court’s final approval of this Settlement Agreement. The \nsuperseding memorandum will apply to Class Members as well as other individuals \nwith Prior UAC Determinations who file an asylum application when the memorandum \nis in effect. The superseding memorandum will remain in effect for at least three years \nfrom the superseding memorandum’s effective date. \n \nB.  USCIS will exercise Initial Jurisdiction over Class Members’ asylum applications in \naccordance with the terms of this Settlement Agreement and adjudicate them on the \nmerits, and USCIS will hold such applications exempt from the One-Year Deadline. \n \nC.  1.  Notwithstanding  Paragraph  III.B  of  this  Settlement  Agreement,  USCIS  may \ndetermine it lacks Initial Jurisdiction over the asylum application of a Class Member if \nthe Class Member was placed in adult immigration detention after a Prior UAC \nDetermination but before filing their asylum application. “Placed in adult immigration \ndetention” does not include custody for the sole purposes of processing the Class \nMember  prior  to  release  on  their  own  recognizance  or  release  through  another \nalternative to detention, such as an order of supervision, parole, enrollment in an \nalternative  to  detention  program,  or  ICE  bond. The  Class  Member  must  submit \nevidence of a Prior UAC Determination that USCIS may adopt. If the individual had \ncontact  with  ICE  as  an  adult,  they  may  also  submit  evidence  of  any  custodial \ndeterminations made by ICE after they attained 18 years of age, including but not \nlimited to the Class Member’s declaration made in accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 1746.   \n \n2.  When USCIS declines Initial Jurisdiction based on this provision, USCIS must \nprovide the Class Member and counsel, if any, with: (a) the jurisdictional rejection; (b) \na detailed description of the information leading USCIS to believe that the Class \nMember was placed in adult immigration detention; and (c) an opportunity to rebut the \ninformation within 30 days (or 33 days if the rejection and accompanying detailed \ndescription are served by mail). USCIS shall simultaneously provide the Class Member \nand counsel, if any, with Class Counsel’s contact information, using the language found \nat Exhibit A. USCIS shall retract the jurisdictional rejection within 30 days of having \n6 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-2     Filed 07/30/24     Page 8 of 52\nreceived the Class Member’s rebuttal if the Class Member has successfully rebutted \nthe information USCIS relied upon to reject Initial Jurisdiction.  \n \n3.  For Class Members who fall within this paragraph due to USCIS’s rejection of \nInitial Jurisdiction and whose applications could otherwise be deemed untimely, DHS \ngenerally will agree to stipulate in their removal proceedings that the Class Member \nqualifies for an extraordinary circumstances exception under 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(D), \n8 C.F.R. § 208.4(a)(5), and has filed within a reasonable period given the circumstances \nunder 8 C.F.R. § 208.4(a)(5) for purposes of the One-Year Deadline such that the One-\nYear Deadline does not bar the asylum application. \n \nD.  In assessing its jurisdiction over asylum applications filed by a Class Member, USCIS \nwill  not  defer  to  any  determinations  by  EOIR,  including  but  not  limited  to \ndeterminations made pursuant to Matter of M-A-C-O-, 27 I&N Dec. 477 (BIA 2018).  \nNotwithstanding  the  previous  sentence,  USCIS  may  adopt  a  previous  EOIR \ndetermination that a Class Member was a UAC at the time of filing their asylum \napplication  for  purposes  of  USCIS’s  accepting  Initial  Jurisdiction  over  a  Class \nMember’s asylum application. \n \nE.  1.  Defendants shall retract any Adverse Jurisdictional Determinations rendered on or \nafter June 30, 2019 that merit retraction under the process described in Paragraph \nIII.C.2 no later than 240 days after USCIS’s issuance of the superseding memorandum \ndescribed in Paragraph III.A.  \n \n2.  Defendants shall retract all other Adverse Jurisdictional Determinations rendered \non or after June 30, 2019 that are inconsistent with Paragraphs III.B and/or III.D no \nlater than 180 days after USCIS’s issuance of the superseding memorandum described \nin Paragraph III.A. \n \n3.  No later than 60 days after the Effective Date, Defendants shall mail to Class \nMembers whose cases will be reviewed under this paragraph a notice of re-examination \nof  jurisdictional  determination  indicating  that  USCIS  will  make  a  jurisdictional \ndetermination in the case pursuant to this Settlement Agreement. Defendants shall \ninclude in the notice Class Counsel’s contact information, using the language found at \nExhibit A. \n \nF.  No  later  than  60  days  after  USCIS’s  issuance  of  the  superseding  memorandum \ndescribed in Paragraph III.A of this Settlement Agreement, Defendants shall release \nthe  holds  placed  beginning  in  March  2021  on  certain  Class  Members’  asylum \napplications involving acts that in USCIS’s view might have qualified under the 2013 \nKim Memo as an affirmative act before filing and shall mail to such Class Members a \nnotice that their asylum application has been released from the hold. Defendants shall \ninclude in the notice Class Counsel’s contact information, using the language found at \nExhibit A. \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-2     Filed 07/30/24     Page 9 of 52\nG.  Defendants will adopt procedures permitting Class Members to request that USCIS \nexercise its discretion to expedite adjudication of asylum applications pending with \nUSCIS on the basis of circumstances that include but need not be limited to: \n \n1.  The Class Member’s immigration detention; \n \n2.  The Class Member received a Notice of Lack of Jurisdiction that was \nretracted  under  Paragraph  III.C  or  Paragraph  III.E  of  this  Settlement \nAgreement; or  \n \n3.  The Class Member has an order of removal. \n \nAll  Class  Members,  including  Class  Members  whose  asylum  applications  were \nreleased from hold pursuant to Paragraph III.F of this Settlement Agreement, may also \navail themselves of the general expedite procedures available at their local asylum \noffices.   \n \nH.  With respect to DHS’s treatment of Class Members in removal proceedings, DHS will \nrefrain from taking the position that USCIS does not have Initial Jurisdiction over a \nClass Member’s asylum application. DHS will join or non-oppose Class Members’ \nmotion(s)  for  a  continuance,  administrative  closure  unless  unavailable  under \ncontrolling law in a particular jurisdiction, and, where available, assignment of cases \nto the EOIR status docket, that have been filed or made orally on the record in \nimmigration proceedings in order to await USCIS exercise of Initial Jurisdiction over \ntheir asylum application. Nothing in this provision prevents DHS from either filing a \nmotion to dismiss or terminate removal proceedings of a Class Member to await \nUSCIS’s  adjudication  of  the  asylum  application  or  as  a  matter  of  prosecutorial \ndiscretion,  or  from  joining  or  non-opposing  a  motion  to  dismiss  or  terminate \nproceedings filed or made orally on the record by a Class Member. DHS will generally \njoin or non-oppose Class Members’ motion(s) to dismiss or terminate filed or otherwise \nmade in order to await USCIS exercise of Initial Jurisdiction over their asylum \napplication. Defendants retain discretion to oppose Class Members’ motion(s) if it \ndeems such opposition warranted based on the individual facts of the cases, as long as \nDHS’s opposition is not based, in whole or in part, on a position that USCIS does not \nhave Initial Jurisdiction over the Class Member’s asylum application. Pursuant to this \nparagraph, Defendants agree that in cases where DHS chooses not to file any response \nwith EOIR indicating its position on the Class Members’ properly served motions for \ncontinuance, dismissal or termination, administrative closure unless unavailable under \ncontrolling  law  in  a  particular  jurisdiction,  adjournments  or,  where  available, \nassignment of cases to the EOIR status docket, this provision of the Settlement \nAgreement serves as evidence of DHS’s non-opposition.  \n \nI.  With respect to any Class Member with a final removal order, ICE will refrain from \nexecuting  the  Class  Member’s  final  removal  order  until  USCIS  issues  a  Final \nDetermination  on  one  properly  filed  asylum  application  under  the  terms  of  this \nAgreement. In order to comply with this provision, ICE Enforcement and Removal \n8 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-2     Filed 07/30/24     Page 10 of 52\nOperations (ERO), the agency responsible for executing removal orders, will make an \nentry indicating there is a stay in its system of records for all identified Class Members, \nincluding Class Members identified by USCIS. This alert will not be removed from \nany individual case until such time as USCIS indicates it is appropriate to remove it.    \n \nJ.  Following a grant of asylum by USCIS to a Class Member with a removal order:  \n \n1.  Defendants agree that, where DHS has chosen not to file a response to a \nproperly filed and served Class Member’s motion to reopen, this provision \nof the Settlement Agreement serves as evidence of DHS’s non-opposition \nto the motion filed on behalf of a Class Member described in this section. \nTo avoid the time and number bars for motions to reopen, Defendants agree \nthat Class Members may style their motions to reopen as a “joint motion to \nreopen” and include language that “Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement \nin J.O.P. v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security, No. 19-01944 (D. Md.), \nDHS is joining in the motion unless DHS files a response within 30 days \nopposing the motion.” DHS will generally join or not oppose a motion to \nreopen. The use of this provision of the Settlement Agreement as evidence \nof  joinder  is  solely  limited  to  DHS’s  joinder  for  the  purposes  of \nacknowledging  class  membership  and  the  terms  of  the  Settlement \nAgreement, and as a factor for the applicability of any time or number bars \nthat may otherwise apply to the motion. This provision may not be used for \nany other purpose. The Defendants agree that any opposition to the motion \nto reopen will not be based on a position that USCIS did not have Initial \nJurisdiction  over  the  Class  Member’s  asylum  application.  The  joinder \nframework found in this paragraph only applies to motions to reopen and \nshall have no effect on any combination or concurrently filed motions, e.g., \nmotions to reopen and dismiss. \n \n2.  In conjunction with or following reopening of such proceedings, DHS will \ngenerally  join  or  non-oppose  termination  or  dismissal  of  removal \nproceedings, but retains discretion to oppose termination or dismissal if it \ndeems such opposition warranted based on the individual facts of a case, as \nlong as DHS’s opposition is not based, in whole or in part, on a position that \nUSCIS did not have Initial Jurisdiction over the Class Member’s asylum \napplication. \n \n3.  Nothing in this provision prevents DHS from filing an unopposed or joint \nmotion to reopen the removal proceedings of a Class Member described in \nthis section, or from filing an unopposed or joint motion to dismiss or \nterminate proceedings of a Class Member described in this section. \n \nK.  For any provision of this Settlement Agreement wherein DHS will join or non-oppose \nmotions filed or made by Class Members, DHS will join or non-oppose such motions \nwhen they are submitted with sufficient evidence of Class membership. Any one of the \nfollowing documents provides sufficient evidence of Class membership for purposes \n9 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-2     Filed 07/30/24     Page 11 of 52\nof DHS’s obligations to join or non-oppose motions as specified elsewhere in the \nSettlement Agreement.  In its discretion, DHS may treat evidence other than that \nspecified below as sufficient evidence of Class membership.  \n \n1.  A copy of a receipt for an asylum application filed pursuant to INA § \n208(b)(3)(C); \n \n2.  A copy of an asylum application cover letter sent to USCIS, along with a \nscreenprint of the USCIS Case Status Online tool reflecting that USCIS has \naccepted the application for processing; or \n \n3.  A declaration made in accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 1746 stating that the \nindividual was determined to be a UAC, filed an asylum application with \nUSCIS that USCIS has not adjudicated on the merits, and on the date they \nfiled their asylum application with USCIS they were 18 years of age or \nolder, or had a parent or legal guardian in the United States available to \nprovide care and physical custody. \nIV.

The \nCourt has carefully considered the settlement agreement (the “Agreement”) together with all \nexhibits thereto (annexed to the Parties’ motion as Exhibit 1), all the filings related to the instant \nmotion, and the record in this case.  The Court hereby gives its preliminary approval of this \nsettlement;  finds  that  the  Agreement  is  sufficiently  fair,  reasonable,  and  adequate  to  allow \ndissemination of notice of the Agreement (“Class Notice”) to the certified Class, as amended \nherein, and to hold a Fairness Hearing; orders the Class Notice be made available to the certified \nClass, as amended herein, in accordance with the Agreement and this Order; and schedules a \nFairness Hearing to determine whether the proposed settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable.   \n \n \n1 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-2     Filed 07/30/24     Page 23 of 52\n \n \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT: \n1.  The Agreement is hereby incorporated by reference in this Order, and all terms or \nphrases used in this Order shall have the same meaning as in the Agreement. \n2.  The Court preliminarily approves the Agreement, provisionally finding that the \nterms of the Agreement are fair, reasonable, and adequate as required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2), \nand within the range of possible approval and sufficient to warrant providing notice to the certified \nClass, as amended herein. \n3.  The Court previously certified the class as “All individuals nationwide who prior \nto the effective date of a lawfully promulgated policy prospectively altering the policy set forth in \nthe 2013 Kim Memorandum (1) were determined to be an Unaccompanied Alien Child; and (2) \nwho  filed  an  asylum  application  that  was  pending  with  the  United  States  Citizenship  and \nImmigration Services (“USCIS”); and (3) on the date they filed their asylum application with \nUSCIS, were 18 years of age or older, or had a parent or legal guardian in the United States who \nis available to provide care and physical custody; and (4) for whom USCIS has not adjudicated the \nindividual’s asylum application on the merits.” \n4.  The Parties agree, as set forth in the Agreement, that the definition of the certified \nClass should be amended as follows:  “All individuals nationwide who prior to the effective date \nof  the  superseding  memorandum  discussed  in  Section  III(A)  [of  the  Agreement]:  (1)  were \ndetermined to be a UAC; and (2) who filed an asylum application that was pending with USCIS; \nand (3) on the date they filed their asylum application with USCIS, were 18 years of age or older, \nor had a parent or legal guardian in the United States who is available to provide care and physical \n2 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-2     Filed 07/30/24     Page 24 of 52\n \ncustody; and (4) for whom USCIS has not adjudicated the individual’s asylum application on the \nmerits.”  The Court adopts the parties’ amended Class definition as set forth in the Agreement. \n5.  The Court finds that the proposed Class Notice and the proposed plan of distribution \nof the Class Notice meet the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e)(1) and hereby \ndirects the parties to proceed with the notice distribution in accordance with the terms of the \nAgreement.  Distribution of the Class Notice must be completed within 14 days of this Order. \n6.  The Court also approves the procedures set forth in Section IV(F) of the Agreement \nfor any objections to the settlement.  Any Class Member who wishes to object to the Agreement \nmust do so within 60 days of this Order.  The Parties will have 14 days following the objection \nperiod in which to submit answers to any objections that are filed. \n7.  The Court directs that a hearing be held on ____, 2024 (the “Fairness Hearing”) to \nassist the Court in finally determining whether the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate; and \nwhether Final Judgment should be entered dismissing with prejudice the claims in the above-\ncaptioned case but retaining jurisdiction in this Court to interpret and enforce the Agreement for \nits duration and to resolve any request for attorneys’ fees and costs.   \n8.  If the Agreement is not finally approved, then (a) all parties will proceed as if the \nAgreement had not been executed and this order not entered, preserving in that event all of their \nrespective claims and defenses in this action; and (b) all releases given will be null and void.  In \nsuch an event, this Court’s orders regarding the Agreement, including this Order, shall not be used \nor referred to in litigation for any purpose.  Nothing in this paragraph is intended to alter the terms \nof the Agreement with respect to the effect of the Agreement if not approved. \n9.  The Parties’ Joint Motion for Preliminary Approval of Proposed Class Action \nSettlement  and  to  Amend  the  Class  Definition  is  hereby  GRANTED.    The  Court  hereby \n3 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-2     Filed 07/30/24     Page 25 of 52\n \npreliminarily approves the proposed class-wide relief set forth in the Agreement, hereby approves \nthe proposed form and plan of notice (addressed in the Agreement), and hereby schedules the \nFairness Hearing.

DHS lawsuit claimed that a 2019 policy \ncreated by the federal government about how to treat asylum applications filed by \npeople previously determined to be an “Unaccompanied Child” (referred to as \n“Unaccompanied Alien Child” in the immigration laws) was unlawful.  \n \nUnder that 2019 policy, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) rejected \nthe asylum applications of people in immigration court removal proceedings who \nhad “Unaccompanied Child” determinations if they no longer met the definition of \n“Unaccompanied Child” on the date they filed the asylum application—even though \nunder the policy that came before the 2019 policy, USCIS accepted such \napplications.  \n \nUnder the challenged 2019 policy, USCIS also applied a one-year filing deadline to \nthe asylum applications of individuals with previous “Unaccompanied Child” \ndeterminations if they no longer met the definition of “Unaccompanied Child” on \nthe date they filed their asylum application—even though under the policy in place \nbefore the 2019 policy, USCIS held such applications exempt from the one-year \ndeadline.  \n \nThe Parties in this case are Plaintiffs J.O.P., M.E.R.E., K.A.R.C., E.D.G., and L.M.Z., all \nasylum seekers with previous “Unaccompanied Child” determinations (“Plaintiffs”), \nand the Defendants are U.S. Department of Homeland Security; Alejandro \nMayorkas, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security; U.S. Citizenship \nand Immigration Services; Ur Mendoza Jaddou, Director of U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement; and Patrick J. \nLechleitner, ICE Deputy Director and Senior Official Performing the Duties of the \nDirector (“the Government”). \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-2     Filed 07/30/24     Page 30 of 52\nSince August of 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland (“Court”) \nhas ordered the Government to stop applying the 2019 policy. On December 21, \n2020, the Court decided that this case could go forward as a nationwide class \naction.  \n \nThe certified class includes all people nationwide who were determined to be an \n“Unaccompanied Child,” filed an asylum application with USCIS that USCIS has not \nyet adjudicated on the merits, and on the date they filed the application were 18 \nyears old or older or had a parent or legal guardian in the United States available to \nprovide care and physical custody.  \n \nThe Court also ordered the Government not to advocate against postponements of \nthe immigration court proceedings of Class Members while they were waiting for \nUSCIS to decide their pending asylum applications. \n \nThe Plaintiffs and the Government subsequently reached this Settlement \nAgreement. The Government denies any wrongdoing, but is settling the case in \norder to avoid the expense and resources to keep fighting the case. The Plaintiffs \nand their lawyers (“Class Counsel”) believe that the proposed Settlement \nAgreement provides important rights and benefits for the Class, and that it is in the \nbest interest of the Class to settle the case, while avoiding the expense and delay of \ncontinuing to fight the case in court. The Court has preliminarily approved the \nSettlement Agreement.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-2     Filed 07/30/24     Page 31 of 52\n3. How do I know if I am part of the class? \n     The Court has certified the following class for purposes of this \nSettlement Agreement (the “Class”): “all individuals nationwide who \nprior to the date that is 90 days after the date of the Court’s final \napproval of this Settlement Agreement  \n  (1) were determined to be an [Unaccompanied Child]; and  \n  (2) who filed an asylum application that was pending with \nUSCIS; and  \n  (3) on the date they filed their asylum application with USCIS, \nwere 18 years of age or older, or had a parent or legal \nguardian in the United States who is available to provide care \nand physical custody; and  \n  (4) for whom USCIS has not adjudicated the individual’s \nasylum application on the merits.”  \n \n \nIn other words, you are part of the Class covered by the Settlement Agreement \n(“Class Member”) if, before the date that is 90 days after the date the Court grants \nfinal approval of the Settlement Agreement, you (1) were determined to be an \nUnaccompanied Child; (2) filed an asylum application that was pending with USCIS; \n(3) on the date you filed your asylum application with USCIS, you were 18 years of \nage or older, or you had a parent or legal guardian in the United States who is \navailable to provide care and physical custody; and (4) have not received an \nadjudication from USCIS on the merits of your asylum application. You do not need \nto live in Maryland to be part of the Class and benefit from the proposed \nSettlement Agreement. \n \n \nImportant: So me individuals who were previously \ndetermined to  be Unaccompanied Children but have \n \nnot yet filed for asylum with USCIS can become \n  Class Members if they file an asylum application with \nUSCIS before the deadline described above and meet \nthe other requirements described above. \n5 \n \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-2     Filed 07/30/24     Page 32 of 52\n4. What does the Settlement Agreement provide? \n \nThis notice summarizes the proposed Settlement Agreement. You can learn how to \nget a copy of the full proposed Settlement Agreement in Part 7 below. In brief, under \nthe proposed Settlement Agreement: \n \nA.  USCIS asylum adjudications. Class Members have a right to have USCIS \ndecide their asylum applications on the merits, even if they are in removal \nproceedings, and USCIS will not apply the one-year deadline for ﬁling asylum \napplications to Class Members’ asylum applications. USCIS will decide the \nasylum application even if an Immigration Judge found that the Immigration \nJudge and not USCIS had the power to decide the asylum application. USCIS \nwill decide the asylum application even if an Immigration Judge refuses to \npostpone the immigration court case while the asylum application is pending \nwith USCIS.  \n \n  Limited exception. USCIS can only refuse to decide a Class Member’s \no\nasylum application on the merits if the Class Member was placed in \nimmigration detention as an adult (meaning the person was 18 years \nold or older) before the Class Member ﬁled their asylum application. If \nUSCIS refuses to consider a Class Member’s asylum application \nbecause of the Class Member’s placement in adult immigration \ndetention, the Class Member is entitled to certain protections speciﬁed \nin the proposed Settlement Agreement. \n \nB.  Retractions of previous rejections. USCIS will retract previous rejections of \nthe asylum applications of qualifying Class Members and reinstate them for \nconsideration under this proposed Settlement Agreement. \n \nC.  Expedite process. USCIS will create a process for Class Members in certain \nspeciﬁed urgent circumstances to request that USCIS expedite their cases. \n \n \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-2     Filed 07/30/24     Page 33 of 52\nD. New USCIS memo. USCIS will issue a memo explaining the procedures it is \nagreeing to under the Settlement Agreement. This memo will apply to Class \nMembers and other people who were previously determined by the \nGovernment to be an “Unaccompanied Child.” USCIS will keep this memo in \nplace for at least three years from its eﬀective date. \n \nE.  Motion practice in immigration court. In a Class Member’s removal \nproceedings, the Government lawyer representing the Department of \nHomeland Security will not argue against USCIS’s authority over the Class \nMember’s asylum application. The Government lawyer will generally join or \nnot oppose the Class Member’s request for dismissal of the removal \nproceedings or for a postponement to await USCIS’s decision on the asylum \napplication.  \n \nF.  Stays of removal. ICE will not remove Class Members with ﬁnal orders of \nremoval from the United States while they are waiting for USCIS to decide \ntheir asylum application under the proposed Settlement Agreement. \n \nG. Motions to reopen. If USCIS grants a Class Member asylum and the Class \nMember has a removal order, the Government lawyer who represents the \nDepartment of Homeland Security in the Class Member’s removal \nproceedings will generally not oppose the Class Member’s motion to reopen \ntheir removal case. \n \nH. Time period: The Settlement Agreement will be in eﬀect for a year and a half \n(548 days) after it goes into eﬀect; except that the USCIS memo will remain in \neﬀect for at least three years.   \n \nI.  Suspected violations: While the Settlement Agreement is in eﬀect, if a Class \nMember believes the Government has violated the Settlement Agreement, \nthat Class Member or their counsel may notify Class Counsel in writing of the \nsuspected violation, and the Parties will seek to resolve the issue.   \n \nAll of the terms of the proposed Settlement Agreement are subject to Court \napproval at a “Final Approval Hearing,” discussed below.  \n7 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-2     Filed 07/30/24     Page 34 of 52\n5. What are the procedures for objections by class members? \n \n \n \nIf you are satisfied with the proposed Settlement Agreement, you do \nnot have to do anything. \n \n \nIf you are not satisfied with the proposed Settlement Agreement, you \ndo not have the right to opt out of the Settlement Agreement. \nHowever, you have the right to ask the Court to deny approval of the \nproposed Settlement Agreement by filing a written objection. You \ncannot ask the Court to order a different settlement; the Court can \nonly approve or reject the proposed Settlement Agreement. If the \nCourt denies approval, this lawsuit will continue. If that is what you \nwant to happen, you must object. \n \nAny objection to the proposed Settlement Agreement and/or notice of \nrequest to be heard at the Final Approval Hearing must be in writing \nand must: \nA.  Clearly identify the case name and number: J.O.P. et al. v. U.S. \nDepartment of Homeland Security, et al., Case No. 19-cv-01944; \nB.  Include the Class Member’s name (using only initials if the Class \nMember is under the age of 18), current address, and telephone \nnumber (or current address and telephone number of the Class \nMember’s legal representative); \nC.  State the grounds upon which the claimed Class membership is \nbased; \nD. Include an explanation of why the Class Member objects to the \nproposed Settlement Agreement, including any supporting \ndocumentation;  \nE.  Indicate whether the Class Member requests the opportunity to be \nheard at the Final Approval Hearing;  \nF.  Be served on the Parties and filed with the Court.  \n8 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-2     Filed 07/30/24     Page 35 of 52\n- To serve a notice of objection and/or request to be heard on the \nParties, you must email the document to [X] or mail it to [X]. It must \nbe emailed or postmarked on or before [DATE]; and  \n- To file a notice of objection and/or request to be heard with the \nCourt, you must mail it to [X] Clerk, United States District Court for the \nDistrict of Maryland, Southern Division, [address], or file it in person at \nany location of the United States District Court for the District of \nMaryland. It must be filed in person or postmarked on or before \n[DATE]. \n \nNote: If your objection does not comply with all of the above requirements, the \nCourt can ignore it or deny your request to be heard. \nAny objection or notice of request to be heard can be filed under seal to avoid \ndisclosure of personal identifying information on the public record.   \n \n6. When is the Final Approval Hearing, what is its purpose, and \nwhat are the potential outcomes?  \n \n  WHEN: \n \n \nThe Final Approval Hearing is \n  scheduled for [DATE] at [TIME] in \nCourtroom [X], [ADDRESS].   \n \n \nNote: this date and time are subject to change by Court Order and may change \nwithout further notice to the Class. The purpose of the Final Approval Hearing is \nfor the Court to determine if the Settlement Agreement is fair, reasonable, and \nadequate.  \n \n \n9 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-2     Filed 07/30/24     Page 36 of 52\nIf you file a timely written objection that complies with the \nrequirements listed in Part 5 above, you may, but are not required to, \nappear at the Final Approval Hearing, either in person or through \nyour own attorney. If you appear through your own attorney at the \nFinal Approval Hearing, you are responsible for hiring and paying that \nattorney. \nIf the Court grants final approval of the Settlement Agreement, Class Members \nwill settle the legal claims identified in the Settlement Agreement and agree to \nstop fighting this lawsuit. \nIf the Court does not grant final approval of the proposed Settlement \nAgreement, the proposed Settlement Agreement will be void, and the Parties will \ncontinue to litigate this case in front of the Court. If that happens, there is no \nguarantee that: (1) the Court will rule in favor of the Class Members; (2) a \nfavorable Court decision, if any, would be as favorable to the Class Members as \nthis Settlement Agreement; or (3) any favorable Court decision would be upheld \nif the Government filed an appeal. \n7.

DHS, Case No. 19-cv-01944-SAG (D. Md.). The J.O.P. v. DHS lawsuit is \nabout the rights of people seeking asylum with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration \nServices who were previously determined to be an “Unaccompanied Child” \n(referred to as “Unaccompanied Alien Child” in the immigration laws).  \n \nThe purpose of this notice is to tell you about the rights of J.O.P. v.

DHS lawsuit about? \n \nJ.O.P. v. DHS is a class action lawsuit that was filed in federal court in Maryland in \nJuly 2019. A class action lawsuit is filed on behalf of a large group of people, rather \nthan one person.  \n \nThe Plaintiffs who brought the J.O.P. v. DHS lawsuit claimed that a 2019 policy \ncreated by the federal government about how to treat asylum applications filed by \npeople previously determined to be an “Unaccompanied Child” was unlawful.  \n \nUnder that 2019 policy, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) rejected \nthe asylum applications of people in immigration court removal proceedings who \nhad “Unaccompanied Child” determinations if they no longer met the definition of \n“Unaccompanied Child” on the date they filed the asylum application—even though \nunder the policy that came before the 2019 policy, USCIS accepted such \napplications.  \n \nUnder the challenged 2019 policy, USCIS also applied a one-year filing deadline to \nthe asylum applications of individuals with previous “Unaccompanied Child” \ndeterminations if they no longer met the definition of “Unaccompanied Child” on \nthe date they filed their asylum application—even though under the policy in place \nbefore the 2019 policy, USCIS held such applications exempt from the one-year \ndeadline.  \n \nThe Parties in this case are Plaintiffs J.O.P., M.E.R.E., K.A.R.C., E.D.G., and L.M.Z., all \nasylum seekers with previous “Unaccompanied Child” determinations (“Plaintiffs”), \nand the Defendants are U.S. Department of Homeland Security; Alejandro \nMayorkas, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security; U.S. Citizenship \nand Immigration Services; Ur Mendoza Jaddou, Director of U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement; and Patrick J. \nLechleitner, ICE Deputy Director and Senior Official Performing the Duties of the \nDirector (“the Government”). \n \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-2     Filed 07/30/24     Page 45 of 52\nIn 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland (“Court”) ordered the \nGovernment to stop applying the 2019 policy. On December 21, 2020, the Court \ndecided that this case could go forward as a nationwide class action. The Court also \nordered the Government not to advocate against postponements of the \nimmigration court proceedings of Class Members while they were waiting for USCIS \nto decide their pending asylum applications. The Plaintiffs and the Government \nsubsequently reached a Settlement Agreement, and the Court approved the \nSettlement Agreement on [DATE]. \n \nHow do I know if I am part of the class? \n    You are part of the Class covered by the Settlement Agreement \n(“Class Member”) if, before [DATE], you \n    (1) were determined to be an Unaccompanied Child;  \n    (2) filed an asylum application that was pending with USCIS;  \n    (3) on the date you filed your asylum application with USCIS, you \nwere 18 years of age or older, or you had a parent or legal \nguardian in the United States who is available to provide care and \nphysical custody; and  \n    (4) have not received an adjudication from USCIS on the merits \nof your asylum application. \n \nImportant: \n \n \nSome individuals who were previously determined to \nbe Unaccompanied Children but have not yet filed for \n \nasylum with USCIS can become Class Members if they \nfile an asylum application with USCIS before [DATE] and \n \nmeet the other requirements described above. \n \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 199-2     Filed 07/30/24     Page 46 of 52\nWhat does the Settlement Agreement provide? \n \nThis notice summarizes the ﬁnal Settlement Agreement. If you want to know more, \nyou should read the Settlement Agreement or talk to your immigration lawyer, if \nyou have one. \n \nIn brief, under the ﬁnal Settlement Agreement: \n \nA.

Motions to reopen. If USCIS grants a Class Member asylum and the Class \nMember has a removal order, the Government lawyer who represents the \nDepartment of Homeland Security in the Class Member’s removal \nproceedings will generally not oppose the Class Member’s motion to reopen \ntheir removal case. \n \nH. Time period: The Settlement Agreement will be in eﬀect for a year and a half \n(548 days) after it goes into eﬀect; except that the USCIS memo will remain in \neﬀect for at least three years.   \n \nI.

      "text": "Case 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 265     Filed 05/05/25     Page 1 of 4\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND, SOUTHERN DIVISION \n \n   \nJ.O.P., et al.,   \n   \nPlaintiffs,   \nCivil Action No. \nv.  8:19-CV-01944-SAG \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nBefore this Court is ECF 264, Defendants’ Motion to Seal their Memorandum in Support of their \nMotion to Vacate (ECF 261-1) and Exhibit A, USCIS Indicative Asylum Decision (ECF 261-2). For the \nreasons discussed below, Defendants’ Motion to Seal will be DENIED IN PART and GRANTED IN \nPART. Additionally, after hearing from the parties at the status conference scheduled in this matter on \nMay  6,  2025,  the  Court  will  consider  whether  to  make  public  additional  information  from  the \nDefendants’ Memorandum in Support of their Motion to Vacate and Exhibit A, USCIS Indicative \nDecision. \nI.  LEGAL STANDARD \nA motion to seal implicates the well-settled common law right of the press and the public to \naccess to judicial documents. See Doe v. Pub. Citizen, 749 F.3d 246, 265-66 (4th Cir. 2014); Media Gen. \nOperations, Inc. v. Buchanan, 417 F.3d 424, 428-29 (4th Cir. 2005). This presumptive right of access is \nqualified, however, and a judicial officer may deny access to judicial documents “if sealing is ‘essential \nto preserve higher values’ and ‘narrowly tailored to serve that interest.’” Buchanan, 417 F.3d at 429 \n(quoting Baltimore Sun Co. v. Goetz, 886 F.2d 60, 65-66 (4th Cir. 1989)). A motion to seal in this Court \nmust also comply with Local Rule 105.11, which requires that the motion “shall include (a) proposed \n \n1 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 265     Filed 05/05/25     Page 2 of 4\nreasons supported by specific factual representations to justify the sealing and (b) an explanation why \nalternatives to sealing would not provide sufficient protection.” This rule “endeavors to protect the \ncommon-law right to inspect and copy judicial records and documents, while recognizing that competing \ninterests sometimes outweigh the public’s right of access.” Simpson v. Tech. Serv. Corp., Civ. No. DKC-\n14-1968, 2015 WL 6447253, at *3 (D. Md. Oct. 22, 2015) (citations omitted). Before granting a motion \nto seal, “the court should consider less drastic alternatives to sealing, such as filing redacted versions of \nthe documents.” Id. \nII.  DISCUSSION \nDefendants ask this Court to seal their Memorandum in Support of their Motion to Vacate, ECF \n261-1, and Exhibit A, USCIS Indicative Asylum Decision, ECF 261-2, because these documents contain \n“Confidential Information” under the Protective Order entered in this case and “information subject to \nthe confidentiality requirements of 8 C.F.R. § 1208.6.” ECF 264 at 2.1 The Protective Order, ECF 136-\n1, ECF 144, protects from public disclosure “class members’ identifying information, including their \nnames and/or alien registration numbers (‘A numbers’).” However, the “Protective Order does not \nconfer blanket protection on all information provided by Defendants to Plaintiffs; the protection it \naffords from public disclosure and use extends only to the limited information or items that are entitled \nto confidential treatment under the applicable legal principles, and it does not presumptively entitle \nparties to file confidential information under seal.” ECF 136-1 at 2 (emphasis added). Thus, to the extent \nDefendants’ Memorandum in Support of their Motion to Vacate and Exhibit A, USCIS Indicative \n \n1 Defendants also contend that filing under seal is necessary for Defendants “to comply with their \nobligations under…this Court’s Order granting Class Counsel’s Motion to Proceed Under Pseudonym, \nECF 254.” ECF 264 at 3. The Court disagrees. Defendants have complied with the Order in their \nMemorandum in Support of their Motion to Vacate, ECF 261-1, by referencing Cristian by pseudonym. \nTo the extent Exhibit A, USCIS Indicative Asylum Decision, ECF 261-2, contains any information \nidentifying Cristian, that information has been redacted in the public version of the document filed \npursuant to this decision. \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 265     Filed 05/05/25     Page 3 of 4\nAsylum  Decision  contain  “Confidential  Information”  pursuant  to  the  Protective  Order,  including \nCristian’s name and A number, that information has been redacted in the public versions of these \ndocuments filed pursuant to this decision. \nDefendants also argue that sealing the “memorandum in support of [their] motion and Exhibit A \nis necessary because Defendants discuss and quote throughout their memorandum information contained \nin Exhibit A, the Indicative Asylum Decision, which is covered by § 1208.6.” ECF 264 at 3. Section \n1208.6 is a “a federal regulation prohibiting government disclosure of information pertaining to asylum \napplications.” Befekadu-Ashene v. Holder, 367 F. App’x 446, 447 (4th Cir. 2010) (emphasis in original). \nDefendants fail to explain why an alternative to sealing, such as redaction, would not provide sufficient \nprotection to comply with § 1208.6. See Loc. R. 105.11 (Md. 2023). Moreover, the cases Defendant cite \nin support of their argument here are inapposite. Befekadu-Ashene involved an asylum applicant who \nalleged that the government breached the regulation by having the Consular Section of the U.S. Embassy \nin Ethiopia investigate a portion of his asylum claim. 367 F. App’x at 446. The Fourth Circuit found that \n“Ashene’s protection against improper disclosure about his request for asylum was not breached” \nbecause “the evidence regarding the investigation does not give rise to a reasonable inference that \nAshene applied for asylum.” Id. at 447. In Doe v. Department of Homeland Security, No. CV 22-5172, \n2023 WL 372085, at *2 (E.D. La. Jan. 24, 2023), a pro se plaintiff sought to seal the entirety of her case \ninvolving processing of her asylum application. The Doe Court found it appropriate to “maintain the seal \non the asylum application-related records” and other filings containing the name of the plaintiff because \nthose documents contained “sensitive information, the disclosure of which could be dangerous for \n[plaintiff] and her family.” Id. at *1-*2. The court weighed the plaintiff’s privacy concerns with “the \npublic’s legitimate interest in knowing all the facts involved in a case,” and found that the interests could \nbe balanced by permitting plaintiff to proceed by pseudonym rather than sealing the entirety of the case. \nId. at *3. \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 265     Filed 05/05/25     Page 4 of 4\nHere, the fact that Cristian (who is proceeding by pseudonym) has applied for asylum is part of \nthe public record in this case. See, e.g., ECF 227-1 at 9; ECF 248 at 17. Moreover, § 1208.6 permits \ndisclosure of “[i]nformation contained in or pertaining to any application for…asylum” to this Court. \nSee id. at § 1208.6(c)(2)(i) (“This section shall not apply to any disclosure to…[a]ny Federal, State, or \nlocal court in the United States considering any legal action…[a]rising from the adjudication of, or \nfailure to adjudicate, the asylum application…”). Balancing the importance of the public’s right of access \nto documents filed in this case, which has garnered significant public interest, with the interests protected \nby § 1208.6, the Court finds that the needs and interests presented here are best achieved by redacting \nany information potentially implicated by § 1208.6 in the public versions of Defendants’ Memorandum \nin Support of their Motion to Vacate and Exhibit A, USCIS Indicative Asylum Decision. See Simpson, \n2015 WL 6447253, at *3. \nAlthough Cristian is proceeding by pseudonym, this Court has continued to redact sensitive \ninformation potentially bearing on the merits of his asylum application, pending further discussion with \nthe parties at the status conference tomorrow about whether additional material should be unsealed.  \nIII.  CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons explained above, Defendants’ Motion to Seal, ECF 264, is DENIED IN PART \nand GRANTED IN PART. A separate Order follows. \n \n \n \nDated: May 5, 2025                     /s/       \n              Stephanie A. Gallagher \nUnited States District Judge\n \n4 \n ",

INTRODUCTION \nThe Settlement Agreement, approved by this Court in November 2024, prohibits removal \nof any Class Member from the United States, provided that the Class Member has a pending \nasylum application with Defendant U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”).  On or \naround March 15, 2025, Defendant U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) removed \nCristian,1 a 20-year-old Class Member from Venezuela, with a pending asylum application, to a \nmaximum security prison in El Salvador, in clear violation of the Settlement Agreement.  Class \nCounsel  seek  the  Court’s  intervention  to  order  Defendants  to  remedy  this  violation  of  the \nSettlement Agreement and prevent any further such violations.   \nThis motion does not implicate the merits of any Class Member’s asylum application.  Nor \ndoes the motion ask the Court to determine the scope of the Government’s removal authority under \nthe Alien Enemies Act (“AEA”).  The Court does not need to decide whether the AEA applies to \nany Class Member.  By this motion, Class Counsel simply seeks to enforce the existing Settlement \nAgreement such that all Class Members can receive the benefits of the Agreement that Defendants \nvoluntarily entered with terms they represented to the Court are fair and reasonable. \nII.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \nA.  This Litigation and the Settlement Agreement \n \nFor most noncitizens seeking asylum, an immigration court has jurisdiction over their \nasylum application.  Unaccompanied children, however, are entitled by statute to have their asylum \napplications decided through a non-adversarial interview by a USCIS asylum officer, even if the \nyoung person is concurrently facing adversarial removal proceedings in immigration court.  8 \n \n1 Class Counsel has filed, contemporaneously with this motion, a motion to proceed using a \npseudonym for the Class Member’s real name.   \n   \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 227-1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 6 of 20\n \nU.S.C. § 1158(b)(3)(C).  Pursuant to a May 28, 2013 memorandum known as the 2013 Kim Memo, \nUSCIS policy was to exercise its statutory initial jurisdiction over any asylum application filed by \na noncitizen whom federal immigration authorities had determined to be an unaccompanied child, \nprovided that determination had not been rescinded before the noncitizen filed the application, and \neven if the applicant had reached the age of 18 or reunited with a parent or legal guardian before \nfiling the asylum application.  USCIS, Updated Procedures for Determination of Initial Jurisdiction \nover Asylum Applications Filed by Unaccompanied Alien Children (May 28, 2013), ECF No. 3-\n4. \nUSCIS’s 2019 Redetermination Memo drastically restricted the group of young asylum \nseekers who would benefit from the statutory asylum protections provided for unaccompanied \nchildren.  ECF No. 3.  Under the 2019 Redetermination Memo, if an individual in removal \nproceedings with a previous unaccompanied child determination applied for asylum after turning \n18 or reunifying with a parent or legal guardian, USCIS would decline jurisdiction over their \nasylum application.  Id. at 5.  In those circumstances, the 2019 Redetermination Memo also \nsubjected an applicant previously determined to be an unaccompanied child to the one-year \ndeadline for filing an asylum application.  Id. at 6.   \nOn July 1, 2019, four named plaintiffs commenced this litigation for declaratory and  \ninjunctive relief, alleging that the USCIS policy changes reflected in the 2019 Redetermination \nMemo were adopted in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), the Immigration \nand Nationality Act, and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \nECF No. 1.  The Court enjoined the policy, entering a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) and \nlater converting the TRO into a preliminary injunction.  ECF Nos. 54, 55, 60, 63, 66, 71.  In 2024, \nthe parties reached a final settlement agreement that provided relief to the certified class of young \n2 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 227-1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 7 of 20\n \nasylum seekers previously determined to be unaccompanied children.  ECF No. 199-2.  On \nNovember 25, 2024—just four months ago—the Court granted Final Approval of the Settlement \nAgreement.  ECF No. 205. \n  Under the Settlement, a core protection for Class Members is the requirement that “USCIS \nwill exercise Initial Jurisdiction over Class Members’ asylum applications in accordance with the \nterms of this Settlement Agreement and adjudicate them on the merits.”  ECF No. 199-2 at 7, \nSection III.B.2  Other provisions of the Settlement Agreement are designed to prevent actions by \nDefendants that would contravene USCIS’s exercise of its initial jurisdiction.  For example, one \nsection prohibits Defendant ICE from taking a position in a Class Member’s immigration court \nproceedings “that USCIS does not have Initial Jurisdiction over a Class Member’s asylum \napplication” and from opposing a Class Member’s motion to postpone their removal proceedings.  \nECF No. 199-2 at 9, Section III.H.   \nParticularly relevant to this motion, the Settlement Agreement provides that, “[w]ith \nrespect to any Class Member with a final removal order, ICE will refrain from executing the Class \nMember’s final removal order until USCIS issues a Final Determination on one properly filed \nasylum application under the terms of this Agreement.”  ECF No. 199-2 at 9, Section III.I.  In \nshort, ICE cannot remove a Class Member whose asylum application is pending with USCIS.  Id.  \nThis is particularly important because the right to seek asylum is afforded to a noncitizen “who is \nphysically present in the United States or who arrives in the United States,” 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1), \nbecause a pending asylum application is typically deemed abandoned upon departure from the \nUnited States, and because USCIS cannot grant asylum to someone who is not in the United States.  \n \n2 A copy of the Settlement Agreement is also attached as Exhibit 1 to the Declaration of Kevin J. \nDeJong, filed contemporaneously with this motion. \n3 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 227-1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 8 of 20\n \n8 C.F.R. § 208.8(a); USCIS, Affirmative Asylum Procedures Manual III.D (“AAPM”) (attached \nas DeJong Decl., Ex. 2) (“AAPM”).  To give effect to the Settlement Agreement, therefore, a Class \nMember must be permitted to remain in the United States until USCIS completes its adjudication \nof the Class Member’s asylum application.  ECF No. 199-2 at 6, Section III.B.   \nIf Class Counsel notifies Defendants of an alleged violation of the Settlement Agreement, \n“Defendants shall send a written response to Class Counsel within a reasonable period of time not \nto exceed 60 days,” and the parties shall meet and confer in good faith within 90 days of Class \nCounsel’s notice.  ECF No. 199-2 at 14, V.D.  This Court has “exclusive jurisdiction to supervise \nthe implementation of this Settlement Agreement and to enforce its provisions and terms until the \nTermination Date.”  ECF No. 199-2 at 13, V.A; ECF No. 205 at 3 (the “Court retains jurisdiction \nto enforce the Agreement during the term of the Agreement...”).3   \nB.  President Trump’s Proclamation and Orders of Removal \nOn March 15, 2025, President Trump issued a Proclamation titled Invocation of the Alien \nEnemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren de Aragua.  DeJong Decl., Ex. \n3.  Section 1 of the Proclamation directed that “Venezuelan citizens 14 years of age or older who \nare members of TdA, are within the United States, and are not actually naturalized or lawful \npermanent residents of the United States are liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and \nremoved as Alien Enemies.”  Id.  Section 3 of the Proclamation provides that “all Alien Enemies \ndescribed in section 1 of this proclamation are subject to immediate apprehension, detention, and \nremoval, and . . . they shall not be permitted residence in the United States.”  Id. § 3.  The \n \n3 The term of the agreement is 548 days after the effective date, which is defined as the date the \nSettlement Agreement received final approval.  ECF No. 199-2 at 4. The Court granted final \napproval on Nov. 25, 2024.  ECF No. 205.  Thus, the Court has jurisdiction over Defendants’ \nviolation of the agreement. \n4 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 227-1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 9 of 20\n \nProclamation instructed the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security “to cause \nthe apprehension, detention, and removal of all members of TdA who otherwise qualify as Alien \nEnemies under section 1 of this proclamation.”  Id. § 6.  According to Robert Cerna, Acting Field \nOffice Director Enforcement and Removal Operations at ICE, on March 15, 2025, Venezuelan \nindividuals were removed to El Salvador pursuant to the President Trump’s March 15, 2025 \nProclamation.  Declaration of Robert L. Cerna ¶¶ 5–6, J.G.G. v. Trump,  No. 1:25-cv-00766 \n(D.D.C. Mar. 18, 2025), ECF No. 28-1 (attached as DeJong Decl., Ex. 4).   \nC.  Defendants’ Removal of Cristian \nCristian is a 20-year-old Class Member from Venezuela.  Bocanegra Decl. ¶ 5.  After \nCristian entered the United States, he was determined by federal immigration officials to be an \n“Unaccompanied Alien Child” (“UAC”).  Id. ¶ 5, Ex. 1.  In December 2022, when he was 18 years \nold, Cristian filed an asylum application (Form I-589) with USCIS, and on December 20, 2022, it \nwas received by USCIS.  Id. ¶ 6, Ex. 2.  Cristian’s asylum application remains pending with \nUSCIS, and he has yet to be scheduled for an interview.  Id. ¶ 6.   \nOn about January 7, 2025, Defendant ICE took Cristian into custody.  Id. ¶ 8.   On or about \nJanuary 8, 2025, ICE commenced removal proceedings against Cristian by filing a Notice to \nAppear in the Conroe, Texas Immigration Court.  Id. ¶ 9.  At a hearing on March 26, 2025, the \nimmigration judge continued Cristian’s removal proceedings, which remain pending, with his next \nmaster calendar hearing scheduled for May 2025.  Id. ¶ 9.   \nOn or around March 15, 2025, ICE removed Cristian to El Salvador in violation of the \nSettlement Agreement.  In their March 20, 2025 response to class counsel’s inquiry, Defendants \ncontend that Cristian was removed “pursuant to 50 U.S.C. § 21 (Alien Enemies Act).”  DeJong \nDecl., Ex. 6  (Mar. 20, 2025 email from Richard Ingebretsen).  Defendants contend that “removal \n5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 227-1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 10 of 20\n \npursuant to Title 50 does not require an administratively final order of removal under Title 8” and \n“[t]herefore, even if a class member, Section III.I does not apply.”  Id.  Contrary to these meritless \nassertions, Cristian is a Class Member, and his removal by ICE violated the Settlement Agreement. \nD.  Defendants Delayed a Meet and Confer While at Least One Class Member \nWas Imprisoned in a Foreign Country \n \nClass  Counsel  has  complied  with  Section  V.D  of  the  Settlement  Agreement,  which \nprovides a mechanism to attempt to resolve a noncompliance.  ECF No. 199-2 at 14.  Class Counsel \nnotified Defendants of the violation of the Settlement Agreement on March 18, 2025, and, on \nMarch 20, Defendants replied by disputing the existence of a violation.  Class Counsel then \nrepeatedly requested a meet and confer with Defendants in an attempt to resolve the dispute \ninformally.  On March 24, 2025, Defendants agreed to confer that week, but then unilaterally \ncanceled.  After repeated requests, Defendants agreed to confer on April 11, 2025.  DeJong Decl., \nEx. 6.    \nDuring the parties’ meet-and-confer held on April 11, Defendants confirmed that Cristian \nwas removed to El Salvador.  DeJong Decl. ¶ 10.  Defendants took the position that Cristian is not \na Class Member, although they did not dispute that Cristian meets each element of the Class \nDefinition.  Id.  Class Counsel understands Defendants’ position to be that individuals whom \nDefendants claims are subject to the AEA cannot be Class Members because, according to \nDefendants, they are not eligible for asylum.  Defendants further stated that they will not agree to \nreturn Cristian to the United States.  Id.  Defendants declined Class Counsel’s request that they \nidentify (1) any other persons who meet the Class Definition and have been removed from the \nUnited States under the AEA; and (2) persons in the United States who meet the Class Definition \nwhom the Government intends to remove pursuant to the AEA.  Id.  \n6 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 227-1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 11 of 20\n \nThe parties were unable to resolve this dispute informally.  Pursuant to Section V.D of the \nAgreement, if the dispute cannot be resolved, “Class Counsel may elect to move to enforce the \nagreement on an individual or class-wide basis before the Court.”  ECF No. 199-2 at 14.  \nAccordingly,  Class  Counsel  now  seek  the  Court’s  intervention  to  enforce  the  Settlement \nAgreement to remedy Defendants’ violation and to prevent any such further violations.   \nIII.  ARGUMENT \nAs detailed above, this Court has exclusive jurisdiction to order a remedy for Defendants’ \nfailure to comply with the Settlement Agreement.  ECF No. 199-2 at 13, V.A; ECF No. 205 at 3.  \nSee Fairfax Countywide Citizens Ass’n v. Fairfax County, 571 F.2d 1299, 1303 n.8 (4th Cir. 1978) \n(“Where the settlement agreement is approved and incorporated into an order of court, the district \ncourt possesses jurisdiction to enforce its own order.”), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 1047 (1978).  The \nCourt also has equitable jurisdiction to order a remedy, and authority to issue a writ in support of \nits jurisdiction pursuant to the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651.   \nA motion to enforce a settlement agreement draws on standard contract principles.  Hensley \nv. Alcon Labs., Inc., 277 F.3d 535, 540 (4th Cir. 2002).  The Court must first look to the plain \nmeaning of the agreement, and may also consider the circumstances surrounding the agreement \nand “the general nature of the remedy agreed upon.”  United States v. S. Coal Corp., 64 F.4th 509, \n514 (4th Cir. 2023).  Here, the plain meaning of the Settlement Agreement prohibits removal of \nClass Members while their asylum applications are pending with USCIS, consistent with the \ncircumstances underlying the Settlement Agreement, which concerns the rights of certain young \npeople in removal proceedings to have their asylum application adjudicated by USCIS in the first \ninstance.  The removal of Cristian violates the Settlement Agreement and demands a remedy. \n7 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 227-1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 12 of 20\n \nA.  Cristian Is a Class Member. \n \nAs a preliminary matter, Cristian is a Class Member.  As defined in the Settlement \nAgreement, and pursuant to the Court’s Final Approval Order, the Class is defined as:  \nAll individuals nationwide who prior to the effective date of the superseding \nmemorandum discussed in Section III(A) of the Settlement Agreement: (1) were \ndetermined to be a UAC; and (2) who filed an asylum application that was pending \nwith USCIS; and (3) on the date they filed their asylum application with USCIS, \nwere 18 years of age or older, or had a parent or legal guardian in the United States \nwho is available to provide care and physical custody; and (4) for whom USCIS \nhas not adjudicated the individual’s asylum application on the merits. \n \nECF No. 205 ¶ 2; ECF No. 199-2 at 5, Section II.E.   Cristian meets each element of the Class \nDefinition because: (1) he was previously determined to be a UAC on or about July 5, 2022, before \nthe February 24, 2025 effective date of the superseding memorandum4 (Bocanegra Decl. ¶ 5, Ex. \n1); (2) he filed an asylum application with USCIS on December 20, 2022, and his application was \npending with USCIS before the February 24, 2025 effective date of the superseding memorandum) \n(Bocanegra Decl. ¶ 6, Ex. 2); (3) at the time he filed his asylum application, he was 18 years old \n(Bocanegra Decl. ¶¶ 5-6); and (4) USCIS has not adjudicated his asylum application on the merits \n(Bocanegra Decl. ¶ 6). \nDefendants do not dispute that Cristian meets each element of the Class Definition; rather, \nDefendants’ position appears to be that an individual who otherwise meets the Class Definition is \nnot a Class Member if the Governments contends he is subject to the Alien Enemies Act.  \nDefendants’  position  is  untenable.    The  Class  Definition  does  not  exclude  individuals  that \n \n4  Per  the  Settlement  Agreement,  Defendant  USCIS  was  obligated  to  issue  a  memorandum \nexplaining and implementing the terms of the agreement.  ECF No. 199-2 at 7, III.A.  The \nmemorandum was issued by USCIS on January 30, 2025 and went into effect on February 24, \n2025.  DeJong Decl., Ex. 7.  Although not the subject of this motion, Class Counsel has identified \nseveral ways in which the memorandum violates the Settlement Agreement.  ECF No. 224 at 1–2. \n8 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 227-1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 13 of 20\n \nDefendants allege are subject to the Alien Enemies Act.  The Class Definition has been ordered \nby this Court in a final judgment (ECF No. 205), and therefore is not subject to after-the-fact \nalteration by the Government.  See Cox v. Shah, No. 98-1357, 1999 WL 492664, at *7 (4th Cir. \nJuly 13, 1999) (“Although Rule 23(c)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a \ndistrict court may alter or amend the class ‘before the decision on the merits,’ that rule is \ninapplicable, absent egregious error, where the district court has already entered a final judgment \napproving a settlement of the class action suit.”).  Defendants were aware of the AEA when they \nentered into the Settlement Agreement, but still agreed to the terms of the Agreement.  Simply put, \nthe AEA does not allow Defendants to disregard the binding commitments it made.  All Class \nMembers are entitled to the benefits of the Settlement Agreement that Defendants agreed are fair \nand reasonable, and Defendants’ attempt to circumvent that Agreement should be rejected.   \nB.  Defendant ICE Removed Cristian in Violation of the Settlement Agreement. \n \nThe Settlement Agreement provides that, “[w]ith respect to any Class Member with a final \nremoval order, ICE will refrain from executing the Class Member’s final removal order until \nUSCIS issues a Final Determination on one properly filed asylum application under the terms of \nthis Agreement.”  ECF No. 199-2 at 9, Section III.I.  ICE cannot remove a Class Member from the \nUnited States if the Class Member has a pending asylum application with USCIS.   \nDespite the clear prohibition on removal set forth in the Settlement Agreement, Defendants \nconcede that ICE removed Cristian to El Salvador on or about March 15, 2025 pursuant to the \nAEA.  DeJong Decl., Ex. 6 (Mar. 20, 2025 email from Richard Ingebretsen).  Cristian’s removal \nstems  from  President  Trump’s  March  15,  2025  Proclamation,  ordering  the  “immediate \napprehension, detention, and removal” of individuals purportedly subject to the AEA.  DeJong \nDecl. Ex. 3.  According to Robert Cerna, Acting Field Officer Enforcement and Removal \n9 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 227-1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 14 of 20\n \nOperations at ICE, on March 15, 2025, individuals (which would have included Cristian) were \nremoved to El Salvador pursuant to the President Trump’s March 15, 2025 Proclamation.   DeJong \nDecl., Ex. 4 ¶¶ 5–6 (Cern Decl.). Indeed, the Supreme Court stated last week that AEA detainees \nwere “subject to removal orders under the AEA.”  Trump v. J.G.G., No. 25-5067, 604 U.S. ___, \nat 3 (Apr. 7, 2025).  And the finality of the removal order cannot be disputed, because Cristian has \nalready been removed to a prison in El Salvador.  Accordingly, there is no reasonable dispute that \nICE  removed  Cristian  pursuant  to  a  “final  removal  order”  in  violation  of  the  Settlement \nAgreement. \nIn correspondence with Class Counsel, Defendants asserted that Cristian was not subject \nto an “administratively final order of removal under Title 8,” but instead removed pursuant to the \nAlien Enemies Act (50 U.S.C. § 21); therefore, according to Defendants, “Section III.I [of the \nSettlement Agreement] does not apply.”  DeJong Decl., Ex. 6.  Defendants’ interpretation of the \nagreement is contrary to the plain language of the Agreement.  The Settlement Agreement prohibits \nremoval of any Class Members subject to “final removal orders,” not just an “administratively \nfinal order of removal under Title 8.”  In fact, the terms “administratively final” and “Title 8” are \nnot found anywhere in Section III.I of the Settlement Agreement. \nThe Settlement Agreement defines many other terms (ECF No. 199-2 at Section II), but \ndoes not define “final removal order,” and therefore the plain meaning of that phrase controls.  W. \nVirginia Highlands Conservancy v. ERP Env’t Fund, Inc., 99 F.4th 194, 202 (4th Cir. 2024) (“[A] \nconsent decree’s interpretation is governed by ‘traditional rules of contract interpretation’ . . . . \n[drawn] from the law of the state in which the consent decree was entered.”); Wells v. Chevy Chase \nBank, F.S.B., 363 Md. 232, 251 (2001) (“[A] court shall give effect to [a contract term’s] plain \nmeaning . . . .”).  As the Government recently argued in J.G.G. v. Trump, the plain meaning of \n10 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 227-1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 15 of 20\n \n“remove” or “removal,” is “[t]he transfer or moving of a person or thing from one location, \nposition, or residence to another.”  Response and Motion to Vacate at 3, No. 1:25-cv-00766 \n(D.D.C. Mar. 17, 2025), ECF No. 24 (quoting Removal, Black’s Law Dictionary (9th ed. 2009)).  \nApplying the Government’s own understanding of the plain and ordinary meaning of “removal,” \nthere is no dispute that Cristian has been “removed.”  Furthermore, Cristian’s removal necessarily \nwas pursuant to a “final removal order”—ICE removed him to El Salvador, pursuant to President \nTrump’s  proclamation ordering  the  Attorney  General  and  DHS  Secretary  “to  cause  the \n \napprehension, detention, and removal” of all individuals whom the Government claims are Alien \nEnemies.  Id. § 6.  ICE, a component of DHS, relied upon the proclamation as the sole and \nsufficient legal basis for removing Cristian from the country, making it a “final order” under any \nreasonable definition.  Cf.  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177–78 (1997) (describing conditions \nfor identifying “final” agency action). \nDefendants’ assertion that Cristian could have been removed from the country without \nimplicating the terms of the Settlement Agreement also directly conflicts with another key \nprovision of the Agreement.  Under Section III.B, “USCIS will exercise Initial Jurisdiction over \nClass Members’ asylum applications in accordance with the terms of [the] Settlement Agreement \nand adjudicate them on the merits.”  ECF No. 199-1 at 7 (emphasis added).  The prohibition on \nremoval in the Agreement prevents ICE from removing a Class Member while they have an asylum \napplication pending with USCIS, to allow USCIS time to adjudicate the application on the merits.  \nBut if an individual leaves the country, USCIS may deem his asylum application abandoned and \nthus not adjudicate it on the merits.  8 C.F.R. § 208.8(a).  Indeed, USCIS is prohibited from \ngranting asylum to an individual who is not in the United States.  DeJong Decl. Ex. 2 (AAPM) at \nIII.D.  Thus, according to Defendants’ flawed interpretation, they can remove Class Members and \n11 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 227-1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 16 of 20\n \nthereby block them from receiving an adjudication on the merits of their asylum application, \ncontradicting the express terms of the Agreement guaranteeing such a procedural right.5 \nThe circumstances underlying the Settlement Agreement further reinforce that Defendants \nhave violated the Agreement.  This litigation challenged a USCIS policy that would have resulted \nin the improper removal of many Class Members by causing their asylum applications to be \nrejected for lack of jurisdiction.  The Settlement Agreement allows for Class Members in removal \nproceedings to have their asylum applications adjudicated on the merits by USCIS while they \nremain in the United States with access to their counsel.  It cannot be reasonably argued that, in \nformulating the Settlement Agreement, the parties contemplated that Class Members with pending \nasylum applications could be removed from the United States to places where they have no access \nto counsel or their family and, importantly, are rendered ineligible for asylum.  Defendants’ \nposition now—that they can remove Class Members pursuant to the AEA—is an attempt to \ncircumvent the Settlement Agreement because they no longer wish to be bound to its terms.  S. \nCoal Corp., 64 F.4th at 517 (“If Southern Coal intended such a backdoor to compliance, then it \n \n5 While Defendants have claimed to Class Counsel, without any legal authority, that individuals \nwhom they determine are subject to the AEA are ineligible for asylum, the J.O.P. Settlement \nAgreement requires USCIS to provide Class Members with an adjudication on the merits where \nthey can present testimony and evidence regarding their eligibility, including with respect to any \neligibility bars USCIS may raise.  ECF No. 199-2 at 7, III.B; see also Trump v. J.G.G., No. 25-\n5067, 604 U.S. ___, at 4 (Apr. 7, 2025) (“AEA detainees must receive notice after the date of this \norder that they are subject to removal under the Act.  The notice must be afforded within a \nreasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper \nvenue before such removal occurs.”). \n \n12 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 227-1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 17 of 20\n \nlikely did not negotiate the Decree in ‘good faith’ to forge an agreement that was ‘fair, reasonable, \nand in the public interest.’”).   \nC.  Defendants Should Be Ordered to Return Cristian and Any Other Removed \nClass Members to the United States and Refrain from Removing Any Other \nClass Members in Violation of the Agreement. \n \nIn addition to the retention of jurisdiction specified in the Settlement Agreement, the Court \nhas authority to enforce the Settlement Agreement.  Fairfax Countywide Citizens, 571 F.2d at 1303 \nn.8 (“Where a settlement agreement is approved and incorporated into an order of court, the district \ncourt possesses jurisdiction to enforce its own order.”); Petty v. Timken Corp., 849 F.2d 130 (4th \nCir. 1988) (trial courts have inherent authority to enforce settlement agreements).  It is well-\nestablished that “[t]he court is invested with broad equitable powers” to penalize, compel, and \nsanction a party.  Alexander v. Hill, 707 F.2d 780, 783 (4th Cir. 1983).  Moreover, the All Writs \nAct, 28 U.S.C. § 1651, authorizes the Court “to issue such commands . . . as may be necessary or \nappropriate to effectuate and prevent the frustration of orders it has previously issued in its exercise \nof jurisdiction otherwise obtained.”  United States v. New York Tel. Co., 434 U.S. 159, 172 (1977).  \n“Powers under [the Act] should be broadly construed,” Hamilton v. Nakai, 453 F.2d 152, 157 (9th \nCir. 1971), and a “consent judgment [is] a sufficient basis for invoking the All Writs Act,” United \nStates v. City of Detroit, 329 F.3d 515, 523 (6th Cir. 2003). \nTo enforce the Settlement Agreement’s prohibition on removal of Class Members, this \nCourt should order ICE to promptly return, or, at minimum, facilitate the return to the United States \nof Cristian and any other Class Members wrongfully removed, so that they can await USCIS \nadjudication of their asylum applications on the merits as they are entitled to under the Settlement \nAgreement.  On the meet and confer held on April 11, 2025, Class Counsel asked Defendants to \nidentify any other Class Members who have been removed pursuant to the AEA.  Defendants \n13 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 227-1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 18 of 20\n \nrefused to do so and declined to state whether any other Class Members have been removed.  \nDeJong Decl. ¶ 10.  Class Counsel are entitled to bring class-wide enforcement of the Settlement \nAgreement (ECF No. 199-2 at 14, V.D); therefore, if other Class Members have been removed to \nEl Salvador, they too should be returned. \nThe Government “can—and does—return wrongfully removed migrants as a matter of \ncourse.”  Abrego Garcia v. Noem, No. 25-1345, 2025 WL 1021113, at *6 (4th Cir. Apr. 7, 2025) \n(Wilkinson, J. concurring) (citing Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009)) (noting that removed \nindividuals “can be afforded effective relief by facilitation of their return”).  For example, in J.L. \nv. Cuccinelli, the court ordered the return of children seeking Special Immigrant Juvenile status \nwho had been removed in violation of the court’s preliminary injunction order.  Order Holding \nDefendants in Civil Contempt and Ordering Sanctions, No. 5:18-cv-04914 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 14, \n2020), ECF No. 249.   \nThis case is the second in this District to seek to remedy Defendants’ unlawful removal of \nnoncitizens to a prison in El Salvador.  In Abrego Garcia v. Noem, the court ordered the United \nStates to return an individual who had been unlawfully removed in violation of a final order \nprecluding his removal to El Salvador. Order Granting Preliminary Injunction, No. 8:25-cv-00951 \n(D. Md. Apr. 4, 2025), ECF No. 21.  The Fourth Circuit declined to stay the court’s order.  Abrego \nGarcia, 2025 WL 1021113, at *1.  On April 7, 2025, the Supreme Court held that the order \n“properly requires the Government to ‘facilitate’ Abrego Garcia’s release from custody in El \nSalvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly \nsent to El Salvador.’”  Noem v. Abrego Garcia, No. 24-A949, 604 U.S. __ (2025).  Class Counsel \nhere seek similar relief—that the Government facilitate the release of any Class Members from \ncustody in El Salvador and return to the United States, ensuring their cases are handled as they \n14 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 227-1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 19 of 20\n \nwould have been had they not been removed to El Salvador in violation of the Settlement \nAgreement.  \nGiven Defendants’ past violation of the Settlement Agreement, Defendants also seek an \norder that removals pursuant to the March 15, 2025 Proclamation of individuals who meet the \nClass Definition who have not yet received a final determination on the merits of their asylum \napplication, is a violation of the Settlement Agreement.  President Trump’s March 15, 2025 \nProclamation remains in effect, and on the meet and confer held on April 11, 2025, Defendants \nrefused to agree to refrain from any further removal of Class Members.  DeJong Decl. ¶ 10.  The \nAgreement  provides  for  class-wide  enforcement  (ECF  No.  199-2  at  14,  V.D),  and  such \nenforcement is warranted here to prevent future violations.   \nIV.  CONCLUSION \n \nFor all the reasons set forth above, Defendants violated the Settlement Agreement by \nremoving a Class Member from the United States while his asylum application is pending with \nUSCIS.  This Court should order the only adequate remedy: the return of the Class Member, and \nany  other  Class  Members  similarly  situated,  to  the  United  States,  where  they  can  await \nadjudication of their asylum applications; and to order that removals pursuant to the March 15, \n2025  Proclamation  of  individuals  who  meet  the  Class  Definition  with  a  pending  asylum \napplication, is a violation of the Settlement Agreement.   \n \n \n \n \n \n15 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-SAG     Document 227-1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 20 of 20\n \nDated: April 14, 2025  Rebecca Scholtz* \n  National Immigration Project of the \n  National Lawyers Guild \nRespectfully submitted,  30 S. 10th Street (c/o University of St. \n  Thomas Legal Services Clinic) \n/s/ Brian T.

(by and through next friend, G.C.P.), M.A.L.C., M.E.R.E., and K.A.R.C. \nfiled a Complaint on July 1, 2019,2 against DHS, its then-Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan, \nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”), and USCIS’s Acting Director Kenneth \nCuccinelli, alleging that a change in Defendants’ policy with respect to asylum applications filed \nby unaccompanied alien3 children violated the APA and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \nAmendment of the U.S. Constitution. ECF No. 1. Plaintiffs simultaneously filed a Motion for \nTRO. ECF No. 14.  \nThe Court held a hearing on the Motion for TRO on July 19, 2019, ECF Nos. 43, 53, and \n \n1 Also pending is Defendants’ Motion for Extension of Time to Respond to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification \nand Appointment of Class Counsel. ECF No. 123. This Motion is granted. \n2 Plaintiffs filed motions to seal an unredacted version of their Complaint, ECF No. 5, and to proceed under \npseudonyms, ECF No. 12, which the Court granted, ECF Nos. 55, 114. \n3 The Court recognizes that “many consider ‘using the term ‘alien’ to refer to other human beings’ to be ‘offensive \nand demeaning.’ [The Court uses] . . . the term only where necessary ‘to be consistent with the statutory language’ \nthat Congress has chosen and ‘to avoid any confusion in replacing a legal term of art with a more appropriate term.’” \nSee Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392, 2443 n.7 (2018) (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (quoting Flores v. U.S. \nCitizenship & Immigration Servs., 718 F.3d 548, 551–52 n.1 (6th Cir. 2013)). \n2 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 3 of 55\nissued a Memorandum Opinion and Order granting the Motion on August 2, 2019, ECF Nos. 54, \n55. In its Order, the Court:  \na. enjoined and restrained [Defendants] from applying their new asylum eligibility \npolicy, as set forth in USCIS’s May 31, 2019 memorandum, to bar individuals \npreviously determined to be unaccompanied alien children (“UACs”) from \nseeking asylum before the agency; and \nb. enjoined and restrained [Defendants] from rejecting jurisdiction over the \napplication of any UAC (as defined in the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. \n§ 279(g)(2)) under the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act \n(“TVPRA”) whose application would have been accepted under the USCIS policy \npredating the May 31, 2019 memorandum; \n. . . \n[and ordered Defendants to] retract any adverse decision already rendered in an \nindividual case applying the 2019 UAC Memorandum . . . and reinstate \nconsideration of such case applying the 2013 UAC Memorandum[.] \nECF No. 55. On August 9, 2019, Defendants filed a Motion for Extension of Time to Comply \nwith Court Order because of logistical challenges in reviewing decisions that may have been \nrendered under the May 2019 Memorandum. ECF No. 57. Following a teleconference, ECF No. \n59, the Court extended the TRO to September 3, 2019, ECF No. 60, and accordingly denied \nDefendants’ Motion as moot, ECF No. 116. The Court extended the TRO two additional times at \nthe parties’ joint request. ECF Nos. 63, 66. On October 9, 2019, Plaintiffs filed a consent motion \nto convert the TRO into a preliminary injunction, ECF No. 70, which the Court granted on \nOctober 15, 2019, ECF No. 71.  \nPlaintiffs filed an unopposed Motion to File an Amended Complaint on November 21, \n2019. ECF No. 74. A month later, on December 20, 2019, Plaintiffs filed the Amended \nComplaint, adding a new Plaintiff, E.D.G., replacing former Defendant McAleenan with new \nActing DHS Secretary, Chad Wolf, and adding as Defendants U.S. Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement (“ICE”) and ICE’s Acting Director, Matthew T. Albence. ECF No. 91. As with the \n3 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 4 of 55\noriginal Complaint, Plaintiffs filed a motion for permission for new Plaintiff E.D.G. to proceed \nunder a pseudonym and omit his home address from the caption of the pleading, ECF No. 92, \nand a motion to seal a copy of the Amended Complaint containing that information, ECF No. 93. \nOn June 3, 2020, this Court granted all three procedural motions, ECF Nos. 74, 92, 93, and held \nthat Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint, ECF No. 91, will be treated as the operative pleading for \nthis action. ECF No. 115 at 2, 5;4 ECF No. 116. \nOn November 22, 2019, Plaintiffs filed a Motion to Enforce the Preliminary Injunction, \nasserting that Defendants were failing to fully comply with the Court’s Order by continuing to \nimplement some portions of the May 2019 USCIS Memorandum—namely Footnote 5, which \ndirects USCIS asylum officers to defer to Executive Office for Immigration Review (“EOIR”) \ndeterminations that an applicant was not an UAC at the time of filing. ECF Nos 75, 76. The \nCourt issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order denying Plaintiffs’ Motion on June 3, 2020. \nECF Nos. 115, 116. However, the Court denied Plaintiffs’ Motion without prejudice “to \nPlaintiffs’ right to move for emergency equitable relief to enjoin the enforcement of the \n[immigration judge (“IJ”)] deferral policy if Plaintiffs believe such enforcement threatens \nimpending irreparable harm.” ECF No. 115 at 24–25. \nDefendants filed a Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint on January 3, 2020. ECF \nNo. 101. Through its June 3, 2020 Memorandum Opinion and Order, the Court denied that \nMotion as well. ECF Nos. 115, 116. Moreover, the Court ordered Defendants to produce an \nadministrative record so that the Court could consider the record before the agency at the time \nthe agency acted. ECF Nos. 115, 116. \n  Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Class Certification and Appointment of Class Counsel on \n \n4 Pin cites to documents filed on the Court’s electronic filing system (CM/ECF) refer to the page numbers generated \nby that system. \n4 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 5 of 55\nJune 15, 2020, requesting that this Court certify the following class with named Plaintiffs as \nclass representatives:5 \nAll individuals nationwide who prior to the effective date of a lawfully \npromulgated policy prospectively altering the policy set forth in the 2013 Kim \nMemorandum (1) were determined to be an Unaccompanied Alien Child; and (2) \nwho filed an asylum application that was pending with the United States \nCitizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”); and (3) on the date they filed \ntheir asylum application with USCIS, were 18 years of age or older, or had a \nparent or legal guardian in the United States who is available to provide care and \nphysical custody; and (4) for whom USCIS has not adjudicated the individual’s \nasylum application on the merits. \nECF No. 117. Defendants responded in Opposition on July 13, 2020. ECF No. 126. Plaintiffs \nreplied in support of the Motion for Class Certification on July 27, 2020. ECF No. 130.  \nAdditionally, on July 7, 2020, Plaintiffs filed a Motion to Amend the Preliminary \nInjunction, requesting that the Court enjoin Defendants from engaging in three practices that \nallegedly threaten to irreparably harm prospective class members before the Court has the \nopportunity to rule on the merits in this case—(1) USCIS’s deferral to IJ determinations that an \nasylum application was not one filed by a UAC; (2) ICE’s advocacy in immigration courts for IJs \nto exercise jurisdiction over prospective class members despite the preliminary injunction in this \ncase; and (3) USCIS’s alleged practice of treating agency records that indicate nothing more than \nthat a UAC had turned 18 or been reunited with a parent or legal guardian as an “affirmative \nact.” ECF No. 124. Defendants responded in Opposition on July 21, 2020. ECF No. 127. \nPlaintiffs replied in support of the Motion to Amend the Preliminary Injunction on August 4, \n2020. ECF No. 134.  \nFinally, the parties have filed two Joint Motions: (1) a Joint Motion to Stay Summary \n \n5 In light of named plaintiff K.A.R.C. being granted asylum, Plaintiffs request that the Court specifically identify \nremaining named plaintiffs as the class representatives. ECF No. 130 at 7 n.1. Plaintiffs’ revised proposed order \nreflects this request. ECF No. 130-3. \n5 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 6 of 55\nJudgment Schedule, ECF No. 135, requesting that briefing on the parties’ motions for summary \njudgment be stayed pending the resolution of the parties’ disputes regarding the contents of the \nadministrative record; and (2) a Joint Motion for Entry of Parties’ Proposed Protective Order, \nECF No. 136. These motions were filed on August 10, 2020, and August 25, 2020, respectively. \nECF Nos. 135, 136. \nB.  Statutory and Regulatory Framework, Initial Complaint, and Enjoined \nPolicy \nWhile the Court has described the statutory and regulatory regime at issue in this case in \nprevious Memorandum Opinions, see, e.g., ECF Nos. 54, 115, it is useful to review it again here. \nIn 2002, Congress enacted the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, 116 Stat. \n2135 (“HSA”). Among other provisions, the HSA assigned the care of “unaccompanied alien \nchildren who are in Federal custody by reason of their immigration status” to the Director of the \nOffice of Refugee Resettlement of the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”). See \nid. § 462(a), (b), codified at 6 U.S.C. § 279(a), (b). The statute defines “unaccompanied alien \nchild” (“UAC”) as a child who: “(A) has no lawful immigration status in the United States; (B) \nhas not attained 18 years of age; and (C) with respect to whom-- (i) there is no parent or legal \nguardian in the United States; or (ii) no parent or legal guardian in the United States is available \nto provide care and physical custody.” Id. § 462(g), codified at 6 U.S.C. § 279(g).  \nIn 2008, Congress enacted the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection \nReauthorization Act of 2008 (“TVPRA”). Pub. L. No. 110-457, 122 Stat. 5044. Among a variety \nof provisions establishing protections for at-risk immigrant children, the statute provides that any \nfederal agency that apprehends or discovers a UAC must notify HHS within 48 hours and must \ntransfer custody of the child to HHS within 72 hours. Id. § 235(b), codified at 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1232(b)(2), (3). Importantly, the TVPRA also provides that USCIS asylum officers “shall have \n6 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 7 of 55\ninitial jurisdiction over any asylum application filed by an unaccompanied alien child.” Id. \n§ 235(d)(7)(B), codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(3)(C). Demonstrating the significance of this \nprovision to the issues raised in this case requires a brief overview of the regime governing \nasylum claims. \nThere are two processes by which a UAC can apply for asylum: affirmative and \ndefensive. The affirmative asylum process, overseen by USCIS, occurs when an immigrant, who \nis present in the U.S. and has been here for less than a year, affirmatively files an asylum \napplication. See 8 U.S.C. § 1158. The application then appears before an asylum officer who \nconducts a private interview “in a nonadversarial manner.” 8 C.F.R. § 208.9(b). Asylum officers \nare specially trained by USCIS in “international human rights law, nonadversarial interview \ntechniques, and other relevant national and international refugee laws and principles.” Id. \n§ 208.1(b).  \nThe second process begins when an individual is placed in section 240 removal \nproceedings in immigration court and raises their asylum claim as a defense to removal.6  \nIndividuals enter section 240 proceedings after receiving a “notice to appear.” Id. § 1229(a). If \nthe applicant has been served, IJs, not USCIS, “shall have exclusive jurisdiction” over the \nindividual’s asylum application during the adversarial immigration court proceedings. 8 C.F.R. \n§ 208.2(a), (b). Immigration courts are operated by EOIR, a DOJ component established by \nregulation. Id. §§ 1003.0, 1003.9, 1003.10.  \nUACs are unique among asylum applicants in that, under the TVPRA’s initial \njurisdiction provision, USCIS has initial jurisdiction over their applications even when removal \nproceedings have been initiated. The statute also exempts UACs from the requirement that a \n \n6 Section 240 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”) concerns “the inadmissibility or deportability of an \nalien.” 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(a)(1). \n7 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 8 of 55\npotential asylee file an application within a year of arriving in the United States. See 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1158(a)(2))(B), (E). Therefore, whether an applicant is considered a UAC can have a \nsignificant impact on his or her progression through the asylum process—this status determines \nwhether the asylum application is adjudicated by USCIS after a non-adversarial interview or by \nan IJ in adversarial removal proceedings. \nThe TVPRA delegates authority to adopt regulations governing UAC asylum applications \nthat “take into account the specialized needs of [UACs] and which address both procedural and \nsubstantive aspects of handling [UACs’] cases.” 8 U.S.C. § 1232(d)(8). The statute does not \nspecify which agency should promulgate such rules, however, and to date no agency has done so, \nleaving the relationship between pre-TVPRA asylum regulations and the statute’s special \nprovisions for UAC applicants somewhat unspecified. USCIS has partially filled this gap with a \nseries of agency memoranda that have addressed, among other issues, if and how asylum officers \nshould assess whether asylum applicants are UACs. The memoranda, as well as other USCIS \npublications, are included as exhibits and cited in Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint. See ECF No. \n91. The first memorandum, issued March 25, 2009 by USCIS Asylum Division Chief Joseph \nLanglois (“2009 Langlois Memo”), directed that the agency would assess, both when an asylum \napplication was received and during the applicant’s interview, whether the applicant qualified as \na UAC at the time of filing the application. Id. ¶ 76; see ECF No. 91-2 at 5. Such an inquiry was \nnecessary, Chief Langlois explained, because USCIS lacks jurisdiction over applications filed by \nindividuals in removal proceedings that are not UACs. ECF No. 91-2 at 5.  \nIn September 2012, the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, an oversight \nofficial within DHS, see 6 U.S.C. § 272, issued a report finding that “USCIS’ policy of \nredetermining UAC status creates delay and confusion.” ECF No. 91-3 at 6. The report used the \n8 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 9 of 55\nterm “redetermination” to describe USCIS’s practice under the 2009 Langlois Memo of \nreexamining whether each claimed UAC asylum applicant was in fact a UAC and disregarding \nthe earlier UAC determination made by the DHS component that apprehended the applicant—\neither U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (“CPB”) or ICE—that enabled the individual to file an \napplication with USCIS despite being in removal proceedings. See id. at 4, 7; see also ECF No. \n91 ¶ 81. The report noted that USCIS’s redeterminations frequently resulted in the agency \nrejecting applications for lack of jurisdiction, producing unfairness and unpredictability for \napplicants, as well as a significant waste of time and resources. ECF No. 91-3 at 8. The \nOmbudsman further stated that “[s]ubjecting a child seeking asylum to multiple UAC \ndeterminations as is required by USCIS’ temporary guidance appears at odds with the TVPRA’s \nexpress purpose, namely, to provide timely, appropriate relief for vulnerable children.” Id. at 6. \nThe report thus recommended that USCIS eliminate redeterminations and simply accept and \nadjudicate the applications of individuals previously determined to be UACs by ICE or CBP. Id. \nat 4–6; see ECF No. 91 ¶ 84. \nUSCIS adopted this recommendation in a May 28, 2013 memorandum by Acting Asylum \nDivision Chief Ted Kim (“2013 Kim Memo”), which modified the procedures established in the \n2009 Langlois Memo. ECF No. 91-4 at 2. Under the new policy, in cases in which CPB or ICE \nhad already determined that an applicant was a UAC and that determination “was still in place on \nthe date the asylum application was filed,” USCIS would adopt that determination without \nanother factual inquiry. Id. at 2–3. The memorandum further clarified that “[u]nless there was an \naffirmative act by HHS, ICE or CBP to terminate the UAC finding before the applicant filed the \ninitial application for asylum,” USCIS would adopt the previous determination that the applicant \nwas a UAC “and take initial jurisdiction over the case.” Id. at 3. USCIS would follow this \n9 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 10 of 55\nprocedure and decline to “question the applicant regarding his or her age and whether he or she \nis accompanied by a parent or legal guardian . . . even if there appears to be evidence that the \napplicant may have turned 18 years of age or may have reunited with a parent or legal guardian \nsince the CPB or ICE determination.” Id.; see ECF No. 91 ¶¶ 87–88. \nSix years later, on June 14, 2019, USCIS published on its website the memorandum at \nissue in this case, which revised the procedures established in the 2013 Kim Memo. ECF No. 91-\n1 at 2. The memorandum (“2019 Redetermination Memo”), which was dated May 31, 2019, \ndiscussed a decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”), an appellate body within \nEOIR that, among other duties, reviews IJ decisions in section 240 proceedings, see 8 C.F.R. \n§ 1003.1(a), (b)(1). ECF No. 91-1 at 3. The 2019 Redetermination Memo explained that in that \nBIA decision, Matter of M-A-C-O-, 27 I. & N. Dec. 477 (BIA 2018) (“MACO”), the BIA \nconcluded that IJs have jurisdiction to determine whether an individual previously determined to \nbe a UAC, but who turned 18 years old before filing an asylum application, no longer qualifies \nas a UAC. ECF No. 91-1 at 3 (citing MACO, 27 I. & N. Dec. at 478). If the IJ makes such a \nfinding, the BIA held, the IJ should conclude that the TVPRA’s initial jurisdiction provision no \nlonger applies and that jurisdiction over the application is held solely by the immigration court. \nId. (citing MACO, 27 I. & N. Dec. at 478). The memorandum clarified, however, that MACO \ndoes not divest USCIS of its authority to determine whether an application was filed by a UAC, \nwith the result that both IJs and USCIS have authority to determine whether USCIS has \njurisdiction over a given application. Id.  \nThe 2019 Redetermination Memo then stated the policy change it was implementing: \nTo ensure that USCIS is making these jurisdictional determinations in a manner \nconsistent with Immigration Judge determinations on the same issue under Matter \nof M-A-C-O-, USCIS is returning to making independent factual inquiries in all \ncases in order to determine whether the individual met the UAC definition on the \n10 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 11 of 55\ndate of filing the asylum application. This will help prevent incongruous results \nwhere USCIS would otherwise have deferred to a prior UAC determination that \nfails to take into consideration the age and other circumstances of the applicant at \nthe time of filing the application.  \n \nId. at 3–4. The memorandum set forth the procedures that an asylum officer should apply when \nmaking a determination whether an applicant qualified as a UAC at the time of filing, stating that \n“[t]he asylum officer must evaluate whether the asylum application was filed by a UAC by \nmaking an independent factual inquiry.” Id. at 4. Additionally, citing MACO for the proposition \nthat “EOIR has jurisdiction to determine its own jurisdiction,” the memorandum stated in a \nfootnote (“Footnote 5”) that “[i]f EOIR has explicitly determined that USCIS does not have \njurisdiction over an asylum application because it is not one filed by a UAC, the asylum officer \nwill defer to that determination.” Id. at 5 n.5. Finally, the memorandum stated that it becomes \neffective 30 days from its issuance and that its new procedures apply to “any USCIS decision \nissued on or after the effective date.” Id. at 2 (emphasis in the original).  \n  In their initial Complaint and TRO Motion, Plaintiffs alleged that the 2019 \nRedetermination Memo’s requirement that USCIS reevaluate whether each claimed UAC asylum \napplicant was a UAC at the time of filing violated the APA, the TVPRA, and Plaintiffs’ due \nprocess rights. ECF No. 1 ¶¶ 123–25, 127–29, 132–37; ECF No. 14 at 2. As described \npreviously, the Court, on August 2, 2019, granted the TRO and barred enforcement of the 2019 \nRedetermination Memo. ECF Nos. 54, 55. Specifically, the Court enjoined Defendants: (1) \n“from applying their new asylum eligibility policy, as set forth in USCIS’s May 31, 2019 \nmemorandum, to bar individuals previously determined to be unaccompanied alien children \n(‘UACs’) from seeking asylum before the agency;” and (2) “from rejecting jurisdiction over the \napplication of any UAC (as defined in the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. § 279(g)(2)) under \nthe Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (“TVPRA”) whose application would \n11 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 12 of 55\nhave been accepted under the USCIS policy predating the May 31, 2019 memorandum.” ECF \nNo. 55 at 1.  \nThe Court also ordered USCIS to “retract any adverse decision already rendered in an \nindividual case applying the 2019 UAC Memorandum [2019 Redetermination Memo] within one \nweek following entry of this Order and reinstate consideration of such case applying the 2013 \nUAC Memorandum.” Id.7 The basis of the Court’s ruling was the finding that Plaintiffs were \nlikely to succeed on claims that Defendants violated the APA by failing to use notice-and-\ncomment rulemaking to implement the policies in the 2019 Redetermination Memo and by \nfailing to consider the reliance interests created by the 2013 Kim Memo. ECF No. 54 at 8.  \nC.  Original Plaintiffs \n  Plaintiffs in this action allege that they came to the United States as children to escape \nviolence, abuse, and persecution in their home countries. See ECF No. 91 ¶¶ 25–26, 32, 37, 43, \n48.  \nPlaintiff J.O.P. is an 18-year-old from Guatemala currently residing with his mother in \nCollege Park, Maryland. Id. ¶ 25. J.O.P. fled his home country when he was 15 years old after \nwitnessing a murder and receiving threats of violence. Id. ¶¶ 26, 132. DHS agents determined \nthat he was a UAC on or about November 25, 2015, after which he was reunified with his \nmother. Id. ¶¶ 28–29. He filed an asylum application with USCIS on February 20, 2018, when he \nwas 17 years old, but he has yet to obtain an interview and is currently in section 240 removal \nproceedings. Id. ¶¶ 27, 30, 133.  \nPlaintiff M.A.L.C. is 21 years old and is also from Guatemala, where he experienced \nrepeated threats of violence and extortion after his parents were murdered. Id. ¶¶ 31–32. He fled \n \n7 The Court’s later Preliminary Injunction Order, which indefinitely extended the TRO, included the same language \nwith minor immaterial modifications. ECF No. 71 at 1–2. \n12 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 13 of 55\nto the United States in August 2016 when he was 17 years old and was determined to be a UAC \nby DHS agents at that time. Id. ¶¶ 32, 34, 124. On February 14, 2018, when he was 19 years old, \nhe filed an asylum application with USCIS. Id. ¶ 35. Currently residing in Los Angeles, \nCalifornia, he has yet to obtain an asylum interview and is now in section 240 removal \nproceedings. Id. ¶¶ 31, 35. \n  Plaintiff M.E.R.E. is a 20-year-old currently residing in Temple Hills, Maryland. Id. ¶ 36. \nHe fled his home country of El Salvador at 15 years old because of the abuse, discrimination, \nand persecution he experienced based on his sexual orientation. Id. ¶¶ 37, 120. On or about \nNovember 15, 2014, DHS agents determined that M.E.R.E. was a UAC, although he was \nsubsequently reunified with his mother. Id. ¶¶ 39–40. On March 30, 2018, when he was 18 years \nold, M.E.R.E. filed an asylum application with USCIS. Id. ¶ 41. He has not yet been scheduled \nfor an interview and is now in section 240 removal proceedings. Id. ¶¶ 38, 41, 122.  \nPlaintiff K.A.R.C. is 20 years old and currently resides in Gaithersburg, Maryland. Id. \n¶ 42. K.A.R.C. is also from El Salvador and fled the country when he was 17 years old because \nof the abuse, discrimination, and persecution he experienced based on his perceived sexual \norientation. Id. ¶¶ 43, 128, 130. In approximately May 2016, DHS agents determined that \nK.A.R.C. was a UAC. Id. ¶ 45. K.A.R.C. filed an asylum application with USCIS in the fall of \n2017 when he was 18 years old and was interviewed in November 2017. Id. ¶¶ 46, 129. On July \n1, 2020, USCIS issued a letter to K.A.R.C. granting him asylum. ECF No. 126 at 22 n.3; ECF \nNo. 130 at 7 n.1. \n  D.  Amended Complaint and Motion to Amend the Preliminary Injunction \n  Plaintiff E.D.G. was added to this action in the Amended Complaint. ECF No. 91. E.D.G. \nis a 20-year-old from Honduras who currently resides in Kansas City, Missouri. ECF No. 91 \n13 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 14 of 55\n¶ 47. E.D.G. fled Honduras when he was 17 years old after years of sexual, physical, and \nemotional abuse and grievous harm inflicted by a gang whose recruitment efforts he had refused. \nId. ¶¶ 48, 135. DHS agents determined that E.D.G. was a UAC on or about July 4, 2016, and he \nwas placed in section 240 removal proceedings the following day. Id. ¶¶ 49–50. E.D.G. filed an \nasylum application with USCIS in late 2017, when he was 18 years old, and was interviewed on \nMarch 6, 2018. Id. ¶ 51. Before a decision was issued, however, an IJ ordered E.D.G. removed \non October 10, 2018, after concluding that the immigration court had jurisdiction over E.D.G.’s \nasylum application and denying the application on the merits. Id. ¶ 52. E.D.G.’s appeal is \ncurrently pending before the BIA. Id. On July 25, 2019, in reliance on the 2019 Redetermination \nMemo, USCIS rejected jurisdiction over E.D.G.’s asylum application because he had not \nestablished that he was under 18 years old at the time he filed it. Id. ¶ 53.  \nThe Court’s TRO, barring enforcement of the 2019 Redetermination Memo, was issued \non August 2, 2019, ECF No. 55, and USCIS reopened E.D.G.’s case in compliance with the \nOrder on August 5, 2019, ECF No. 91 ¶¶ 53, 137. On September 30, 2019, however, while the \nTRO remained in effect, USCIS again rejected jurisdiction over E.D.G.’s application. ECF No. \n91 ¶ 54. The agency issued to E.D.G. a Notice of Lack of Jurisdiction stating that the \n“Immigration Judge made an affirmative act to terminate UAC status on October 10, 2018.” Id. \n¶ 137. Plaintiffs allege that this decision was made pursuant to Footnote 5 of the 2019 \nRedetermination Memo, which directs USCIS to defer to EOIR determinations that USCIS lacks \njurisdiction over an application because it was not filed by a UAC. Id. ¶¶ 15, 137. Plaintiffs \nallege in the Amended Complaint and in the Motion to Amend the Preliminary Injunction that \nDefendants’ deferral to IJ determinations—illustrated by Plaintiff E.D.G.’s experience—is in \n14 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 15 of 55\nviolation of the Due Process Clause and the APA and thus should be enjoined. ECF No. 91 at \n159–62, 171–79; ECF No. 124-1 at 18–19. \nPlaintiffs further allege in the Amended Complaint that “Defendants have maintained a \npolicy and practice that erroneously deprives” Plaintiffs, and the class of similarly situated UAC \nasylum applicants that they seek to represent, “of USCIS’s statutory initial jurisdiction over their \nasylum applications[.]” Id. ¶ 141. Newly added Defendant ICE, Plaintiffs contend, contributes to \nthis deprivation in its role as a prosecutor in immigration courts. Id. ¶¶ 18, 60, 140. According to \nPlaintiffs, ICE maintains a policy or practice of advocating for IJs to conclude that applicants \nwho have turned 18 or reunified with a parent before applying for asylum are not within \nUSCIS’s jurisdiction. Id. ¶ 22.  \nSpecifically, Plaintiffs assert that ICE attorneys argue before IJs that EOIR should assert \nits jurisdiction in such cases in order to deprive USCIS of the opportunity to exercise initial \njurisdiction, given the IJ deferral policy in the 2019 Redetermination Memo. Id. ¶¶ 18, 108. \nFurther, Plaintiffs allege that ICE prosecutors actively oppose in removal proceedings efforts by \nUACs to delay IJ consideration of their asylum claims while USCIS considers them. Id. ¶ 140. \nInstead, ICE advocates for scheduling IJ hearings on the asylum claims and actively opposes \ncontinuances or postponements. Id. ¶¶ 140–41. Plaintiffs allege that this advocacy before IJs is \ndirectly related to USCIS’s decision to defer to IJ jurisdictional determinations, evidencing a \nconcerted, cross-agency strategy of attempting to evade or minimize the impact of the TVPRA’s \ninitial jurisdiction provision for UACs, and thus should be enjoined. Id. ¶¶ 18, 141; see also ECF \nNo. 124-1 at 21–23. \nPlaintiffs illustrate ICE’s alleged behavior by introducing proposed class member \nJ.S.G.C. in the Motion to Amend the Preliminary Injunction. ECF No. 124-1 at 10. J.S.G.C. is an \n15 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 16 of 55\n18-year-old from Mexico. Id.; ECF No. 124-5 ¶ 2. DHS classified J.S.G.C. as a UAC when he \nentered the United States on June 26, 2019, but later released J.S.G.C. to the care of his mother \non his eighteenth birthday. ECF No. 124-1 at 10; ECF No. 124-5 ¶¶ 3–4. In August 2019, DHS \nserved J.S.G.C. with a Notice to Appeal and placed him in removal proceedings. ECF No. 124-1 \nat 10; ECF No. 124-5 ¶ 5. On December 20, 2019, J.S.G.C.’s counsel filed an asylum application \nwith USCIS on his behalf. ECF No. 124-1 at 10; ECF No. 124-5 ¶ 6. His application remains \npending, but USCIS has not scheduled an asylum interview for J.S.G.C. yet. Id. \nAt a February 12, 2020, master calendar hearing in immigration court, J.S.G.C.’s counsel \nmoved, in reliance on this Court’s preliminary injunction order, to hold J.S.G.C.’s removal \nproceedings in abeyance while USCIS adjudicated his asylum application. ECF No. 124-1 at 10; \nECF No. 124-5 ¶¶ 8, 10. The ICE Assistant Chief Counsel filed an opposition to J.S.G.C.’s \nmotion in April 2020, arguing that USCIS does not have initial jurisdiction over J.S.G.C.’s \nasylum application under MACO because J.S.G.C. filed his asylum application with USCIS after \nhe turned 18 years old. ECF No. 124-1 at 10–11; ECF No. 124-5 ¶¶ 11–12. The ICE Assistant \nChief Counsel dismissed J.S.G.C.’s counsel’s arguments regarding this Court’s preliminary \ninjunction as reliance on “an internal USCIS memorandum[] and . . . district court decisions \nfrom other jurisdictions, none of which bind the Immigration Judge[.]” ECF No. 124-7 at 4. On \nApril 16, 2020, the immigration judge denied J.S.G.C.’s motion, explicitly relying on ICE’s \narguments against USCIS’s initial jurisdiction. ECF No. 124-1 at 11; ECF No. 124-5 ¶ 13; ECF \nNo. 124-8 at 3.8  \n  Finally, in the Motion to Amend the Preliminary Injunction, ECF No. 124, Plaintiffs \n \n8 However, through further motion practice based on his pursuit of an additional form of relief (Special Immigrant \nJuvenile Status), on June 23, 2020, J.S.G.C.’s counsel persuaded the judge to place his case on the status docket. \nECF No. 124-1 at 11; ECF No. 124-5 ¶ 15. \n \n16 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 17 of 55\nallege additional problematic behavior by Defendants that is indicative of Defendants’ policy and \npractice of depriving Plaintiffs, and the proposed class of others similarly situated, of USCIS’s \nstatutory initial jurisdiction over their asylum applications. Specifically, Plaintiffs claim that \n“Defendant USCIS has adopted a practice of treating agency records, indicating nothing more \nthan that a UAC has turned 18 or been reunited with a parent or legal guardian, as an ‘affirmative \nact’ even though that interpretation is at odds with the 2013 Kim Memo and the asylum \napplicants are never made aware of any putative redetermination.” ECF No. 124-1 at 6. Plaintiffs \nclaim that this behavior—like USCIS’s deferral to IJ determinations and ICE’s advocacy in \nimmigration courts for IJs to exercise jurisdiction over prospective class members despite the \npreliminary injunction in this case—is a back door method of effectuating the policy goal \noutlined in the 2019 Redetermination Memo while maintaining that USCIS is now operating \nunder this Court’s Order to revert to the 2013 Kim Memo. \n  Plaintiffs further illustrate Defendants’ actions through the introduction of a prospective \nclass member, L.M.Z. ECF No. 124-1 at 11. L.M.Z. is a 9-year-old from Mexico who entered the \nUnited States on or about May 20, 2018. Id.; ECF No. 124-9 ¶¶ 2–3. Upon his entry, Defendant \nDHS determined that L.M.Z. was a UAC, issued him a Notice to Appear, and placed him in \nremoval proceedings in immigration court. ECF No. 124-1 at 11; ECF No. 124-9 ¶¶ 3–4. HHS \nreleased L.M.Z. to the care of his mother on or about June 8, 2018. ECF No. 124-1 at 11; ECF \nNo. 124-9 ¶ 5. On February 8, 2019, while his removal proceedings were pending in immigration \ncourt, L.M.Z. filed his asylum application with USCIS. ECF No. 124-1 at 12; ECF No. 124-9 \n¶ 7.  \nOn February 5, 2020, L.M.Z. appeared with counsel for his scheduled asylum interview \nwith USCIS. ECF No. 124-1 at 12; ECF No. 124-9 ¶¶ 9–10; ECF No. 124-13 ¶ 7. The asylum \n17 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 18 of 55\nofficer did not ask any questions about the merits of L.M.Z.’s asylum claim, and, instead, asked a \nseries of questions about the care provided by his mother. ECF No. 124-1 at 12; ECF No. 124-13 \n¶¶ 7–8. The officer ended the interview following those questions, stating that she was making a \nfinal factual finding that L.M.Z. was not a UAC. ECF No. 124-1 at 12; ECF No. 124-13 ¶ 8. \nL.M.Z.’s counsel informed the officer that USCIS must exercise jurisdiction under the 2013 Kim \nMemo, as affirmed by this Court’s Preliminary Injunction Order, but the officer, after conferring \nwith her supervisor, refused to complete the interview. ECF No. 124-1 at 12; ECF No. 124-13 \n¶ 8.  \nOn March 13, 2020, USCIS issued a “Notice of Lack of Jurisdiction (Non-UAC),” \ndenying jurisdiction over L.M.Z.’s case. ECF No. 124-1 at 12; ECF No. 124-9 ¶ 12. In the \nasylum officer’s declaration, she stated that she “reviewed the comments tab in the ENFORCE \nAlien Removal Module (EARM) and determined that ICE had taken affirmative action on \nAugust 14, 2018 that terminated the prior UAC designation.” ECF No. 125-5 ¶ 6. On that date, \nan ICE agent entered a notation in the computer system that “[s]ubject is no longer designated a \nUAC under the TVPRA as of date of release to sponsor-mother- on 06/08/2018.” Id. Plaintiffs \ncontend that such a notation is not an “affirmative act” as described in the 2013 Kim Memo, and \nUSCIS’s “litigation-inspired reinterpretation . . . is substantively indistinguishable from the 2019 \nRedetermination Policy that the Court enjoined[.]” ECF No. 124-1 at 24. Thus, Plaintiffs argue \nthat “Defendants’ practice of treating a mere recognition [in a government database] that UAC \nhad turned 18 or been reunited with a parent or legal guardian” as an “affirmative act” violates \nthe Due Process Clause and the APA and should thus be enjoined. ECF No. 124-1 at 24–27. \nII.  DISCUSSION \nThe Court discusses the parties’ pending motions below separately and in the order they \n18 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 19 of 55\nwere filed for maximum clarity. \nA.  Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification and Appointment of Class Counsel \n  A class action allows representative parties to prosecute not only their own claims, but \nalso the claims of other similarly situated individuals. Thorn v. Jefferson-Pilot Life Ins. Co., 445 \nF.3d 311, 318 (4th Cir. 2006). “Chief among the justifications for this device is its efficiency[.]” \nId. Adjudication of a properly-constituted class action “saves the resources of both the courts and \nthe parties by permitting an issue potentially affecting every [class member] to be litigated in an \neconomical fashion.” Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, \n701 (1979)). “Class certification is strictly a procedural matter, and the merits of the case at stake \nare not to be considered when deciding whether to certify a class.” Hewlett v. Premier Salons \nInt’l, Inc., 185 F.R.D. 211, 214 (D. Md. 1997) (citing Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. \n156, 177 (1974)).  \n  Class certification is governed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 23, which provides a two-step \nframework for certifying a class. First, the proposed class must satisfy the four prerequisites \nidentified in Rule 23(a): (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable \n(“numerosity”); (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class (“commonality”); (3) \nthe claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the \nclass (“typicality”); and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the \ninterests of the class (“adequate representation”). Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). If those requirements are \nsatisfied, the action must further qualify for one of the three categories of classes identified in \nRule 23(b): (1) prosecuting separate actions would create a risk of inconsistent or varying \nadjudications or impair the ability of nonparties to protect their interests; (2) final injunctive or \ndeclaratory relief is appropriate; or (3) questions of law or fact common to all class members \n19 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 20 of 55\npredominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and a class action is superior \nto other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy. Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(b). \n  In addition to the two-step framework expressly laid out in Rule 23, the Fourth Circuit \nhas “repeatedly recognized that Rule 23 contains an implicit threshold requirement that the \nmembers of a proposed class be ‘readily identifiable.’” EQT Prod. Co. v. Adair, 764 F.3d 347, \n358 (4th Cir. 2014) (quoting Hammond v. Powell, 462 F.2d 1053, 1055 (4th Cir. 1972)). Other \ncircuits have described this rule as an “ascertainability” requirement. Id. “However phrased, the \nrequirement is the same. A class cannot be certified unless a court can readily identify the class \nmembers in reference to objective criteria.” Id. \n1.  Readily Identifiable \nDefendants contend that Plaintiffs’ class definition fails to meet the “ascertainability” \nrequirement because “identifying who did not meet the UAC definition at the time of filing their \nasylum application—a pivotal element of Plaintiffs’ proposed class definition—entails \nsubstantial administrative difficulties[,]” and because “Plaintiffs’ class definition lacks sufficient \nclarity to even identify such relevant class.” ECF No. 126 at 11. Plaintiffs’ responding argument \nis twofold: (1) the ascertainability threshold does not apply to Rule 23(b)(2) classes; and (2) even \nif it did, the proposed class is ascertainable. ECF No. 130 at 7, 11. The Court addresses both \narguments below. \na.  The “Readily Identifiable” or “Ascertainability” Standard \nApplies to Class Certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) \nUnder Fourth Circuit Precedent \nThe Fourth Circuit first adopted the threshold requirement that members of a proposed \nclass be “readily identifiable” in Hammond, 462 F.2d at 1055. The Fourth Circuit, without \ndiscussion, concluded in Hammond that “the class [was] adequately delineated” and that “[a]t the \n20 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 21 of 55\ntime of judgment the individual members of the class [would] be readily identifiable.” Id. The \nFourth Circuit later explained that this “readily identifiable” threshold requirement is implicit in \nRule 23. In re A.H. Robins Co., Inc., 880 F.2d 709, 728 (4th Cir. 1989) (“Though not specified in \nthe Rule, establishment of a class action implicitly requires . . . that there be an identifiable \nclass”). It was not until EQT Production Co., 764 F.3d 347, however, that the Fourth Circuit \nexpounded on the meaning of the “readily identifiable” requirement.  \nIn EQT Production Co., the Fourth Circuit vacated the class certification decision of the \ndistrict court and remanded the case for reconsideration of the ascertainability issues, concluding \nthat the district court had previously “failed to rigorously analyze whether the administrative \nburden of identifying class members . . . would render class proceedings too onerous.” 764 F.3d \nat 358. The Fourth Circuit explained “[a] class cannot be certified unless a court can readily \nidentify the class members in reference to objective criteria.” Id. (citing Marcus v. BMW of N. \nAm., LLC, 687 F.3d 583, 593 (3d Cir. 2012); Crosby v. Soc. Sec. Admin. of U.S., 796 F.2d 576, \n579–80 (1st Cir. 1986)). Specifically, although “plaintiffs need not be able to identify every class \nmember at the time of certification[,] . . . ‘[i]f class members are impossible to identify without \nextensive and individualized fact-finding or ‘mini-trials,’ then a class action is inappropriate.” Id. \n(quoting Marcus, 687 F.3d at 593). EQT Production Co. has come to stand for the proposition \nthat the goal of the “readily identifiable” requirement is “to define a class in such a way as to \nensure that there will be some ‘administratively feasible [way] for the court to determine whether \na particular individual is a member’ at some point.” Krakauer v. Dish Network, L.L.C., 925 F.3d \n643, 658 (4th Cir. 2019) (quoting EQT Prod. Co., 764 F.3d at 358). Moreover, opinions of this \nCourt have further expounded that a “plaintiff cannot merely identify a mass of data which could \naid the process of identifying class members[,] . . . the Plaintiff must also provide an efficient \n21 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 22 of 55\nmethod of using this information.” Spotswood v. Hertz Corp., No. RDB-16-1200, 2019 WL \n498822, at *6 (D. Md. Feb. 7, 2019). \nWhile not all Circuits agree with the Fourth Circuit’s articulation of the ascertainability \nrequirement, see, e.g., In re Petrobras Sec., 862 F.3d 250, 264 (2d Cir. 2017) (“conclud[ing] that \na freestanding administrative feasibility requirement is neither compelled by precedent nor \nconsistent with Rule 23”); Briseno v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., 844 F.3d 1121, 1123 (9th Cir. 2017) \n(declining to interpret Rule 23 to require that class representatives “demonstrate that there is an \n‘administratively feasible’ means of identifying absent class members”); Mullins v. Direct \nDigital, LLC, 795 F.3d 654, 672 (7th Cir. 2015) (“declin[ing] Direct Digital’s invitation to adopt \na heightened ascertainability requirement” and instead holding that “[d]istrict courts should \ncontinue to insist that the class definition satisfy the established meaning of ascertainability by \ndefining classes clearly and with objective criteria”), several Circuits have adopted a similar \nadministrative feasibility interpretation of the threshold requirement, see, e.g., Cole v. City of \nMemphis, 839 F.3d 530, 541 (6th Cir. 2016) (“we adopted the ascertainability requirement \nnoting that certification necessitated ‘a class description [that is] sufficiently definite so that it is \nadministratively feasible for the court to determine whether a particular individual is a member’” \n(internal citations omitted)); Byrd v. Aaron’s Inc., 784 F.3d 154, 163 (3d Cir. 2015) (“The \nascertainability inquiry is two-fold, requiring a plaintiff to show that: (1) the class is defined with \nreference to objective criteria; and (2) there is a reliable and administratively feasible mechanism \nfor determining whether putative class member fall within the class definition.” (internal \nquotation marks omitted)); Karhu v. Vital Pharm., 621 F. App’x 945, 946 (11th Cir. 2015) (“a \nclass is not ascertainable unless the class definition contains objective criteria that allow for class \nmembers to be identified in an administratively feasible way”); Crosby, 796 F.2d at 580 \n22 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 23 of 55\n(requiring that the “description of class . . . be sufficiently definite so that it is administratively \nfeasible to determine whether a particular individual is a member”).  \nYet, of the Circuits that have espoused a heightened ascertainability requirement similar \nto that of the Fourth Circuit’s, the First, Third and Sixth Circuits have said this administrative \nfeasibility requirement does not apply in the context of certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(b)(2). See, e.g., Cole, 839 F.3d at 542 (“a judicially created implied requirement of \nascertainability—that the members of the class be capable of specific enumeration—is \ninappropriate for (b)(2) cases” (emphasis in original)); Shelton v. Bledsoe, 775 F.3d 554, 561 (3d \nCir. 2015) (same); Yaffe v. Powers, 454 F.2d 1362, 1366 (1st Cir. 1972), abrogated on other \ngrounds by Gardner v. Westinghouse Broad. Co., 437 U.S. 478 (1978) (“Although notice to and \ntherefore precise definition of the members of the suggested class are important to certification \nof a subdivision (b)(3) class, notice to the members of a (b)(2) class is not required and the actual \nmembership of the class need not therefore be precisely delimited.”). In reaching this conclusion, \nthese courts have observed that the purposes for which courts created the heightened \nascertainability requirement are absent in (b)(2) actions. “[A]scertainability is a requirement tied \nalmost exclusively to the practical need to notify absent class members and to allow those \nmembers a chance to opt-out[,]” however, unlike (b)(3) classes, (b)(2) class members are not \nentitled to such notice and opportunity to opt-out. Cole, 839 F.3d at 541 (citing Marcus, 687 F.3d \nat 593); see also Yaffe, 454 F.2d at 1366. Thus, “the practical efficiencies that come with \nknowing the precise membership of the class are nonexistent” in a (b)(2) action. Id.; see also \nShelton, 775 F.3d at 560–61. These courts also have observed, in reaching their conclusion, that, \n“because a remedy obtained by one member [of a (b)(2) class] will naturally affect the others, the \nidentities of individual class members are less critical in a (b)(2) action[.]” Shelton, 775 F.3d at \n23 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 24 of 55\n561; see also Cole, 839 F.3d at 542. “If relief is granted . . . the defendants are legally obligated \nto comply, and it is usually unnecessary to define with precision the persons entitled to enforce \ncompliance, since . . . the representative plaintiffs would be available to seek . . . relief if \nnecessary.” Shelton, 775 F.3d at 561 (internal quotations omitted) (quoting Rice v. City of Phila, \n6 F.R.D. 17, 19 (E.D. Pa. 1974)). Lastly, these courts support their conclusion by citing to an \nAdvisory Committee note to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 that lists as an example of a (b)(2) class “various \nactions . . . where a party is charged with discriminating unlawfully against a class, usually one \nwhose members are incapable of specific enumeration.” Id. (emphasis in original) (citing Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 23); see also Cole, 839 F.3d at 542; Yaffe, 454 F.2d at 1366. Such a class would \nundoubtedly fail an administrative feasibility requirement, and thus the courts conclude such a \nrequirement must not apply to (b)(2) actions. Shelton, 775 F.3d at 561. \nPlaintiffs now ask this Court to hold that the Fourth Circuit’s interpretation of the \n“readily identifiable” threshold requirement aligns with that of the First, Third, and Sixth \nCircuits and thus to hold that the heightened ascertainability requirement outlined in EQT \nProduction Co. does not apply to Plaintiffs’ request to certify a class under Rule 23(b)(2). ECF \nNo. 130 at 7–11. The problem with this request, however, is that it would not square with the \nFourth Circuit’s statements on the issue. \nIt is fair to say that the Fourth Circuit has not explicitly discussed whether the \nrequirement that plaintiffs identify an administratively feasible way to identify class members \nshould apply with equal force regardless of whether plaintiffs are attempting certification under \nRule 23(b)(1), (2), or (3). But EQT Production Co., 764 F.3d 347, at least suggests that it does. \nIn EQT Production Co., the Fourth Circuit discussed ascertainability with respect to the \nplaintiffs’ “ownership classes” for which plaintiffs sought class certification under both Rules \n24 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 25 of 55\n23(b)(2) and (3). See 764 F.3d at 357. Specifically, the classes that the Fourth Circuit ultimately \nordered the district court to reconsider on ascertainability grounds sought “a declaration that the \nclass members [were] true owners of CBM, as well as payment of the royalties they believe \n[defendants] have improperly escrowed or withheld.” Id. at 358 (emphasis added). The Fourth \nCircuit did not suggest a different analysis for each rule. Nor does the Fourth Circuit’s expressed \nfear that, without an ascertainable class, it will “have little conception . . . of who may be bound \nby a potential merits ruling[,]” id. at 359–60, distinguish between rulings that involve declaratory \nrelief, covered by Rule 23(b)(2), and rulings rewarding royalties or other individualized relief.  \nDespite the lack of explicit guidance on this issue, it appears that the Fourth Circuit’s \nadministrative feasibility interpretation of ascertainability applies equally to all classes regardless \nof the section of Rule 23(b) under which certification is pursued. While the Fourth Circuit may \neventually decide to align with the reasoning of the First, Third, and Sixth Circuits and hold that \nthe administrative feasibility requirement is inappropriate in the context of Rule 23(b)(2) because \nthe purposes for which the requirement was created are absent; it has not yet done so. Based on \nthe Court’s reading of EQT Production Co., the threshold requirement of ascertainability that is \nimplicit in Rule 23 applies to Plaintiffs’ proposed class. \nb.  Plaintiffs’ Proposed Class is Readily Identifiable or \nAscertainable \nAlthough the ascertainability requirement applies to Plaintiffs’ proposed class under \nFourth Circuit precedent, Plaintiffs’ class satisfies this requirement. Defendants present two \narguments to the contrary: (a) “identifying who did not meet the UAC definition at the time of \nfiling their asylum application . . . entails substantial administrative difficulties[,]” ECF No. 126 \nat 11; and (b) the class “definition is too vague to enable the court to identify a relevant class[,]” \nid. at 15. This Court will address each argument in turn. \n25 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 26 of 55\ni.  Administrative Difficulties \nDefendants first argue that Plaintiffs’ proposed class is not ascertainable because \n“identifying who did not meet the UAC definition at the time of filing their asylum application \n. . . entails substantial administrative difficulties.” ECF No. 126 at 11. However, Defendants’ \nargument ignores the circumstances of this case and the context in which class members would \nneed to be identified.  \nThe implicit prerequisite in Rule 23 that a class must be ascertainable stems from the \nrequirement that a class must exist. See 7A Charles Alan Wright, et al., Federal Practice and \nProcedure § 1760 (3d ed. 2020). “Whether a class exists is a question of fact that will be \ndetermined on the basis of the circumstances of each case.” Id. A court must analyze whether the \nmembers of a proposed class are readily identifiable in the context of the class proceedings at \nissue. See EQT Production Co., 764 F.3d at 358. The relevant inquiry is whether “the \nadministrative burden of identifying class members in the [instant case] would render class \nproceedings too onerous.” Id. (emphasis added). The answer here is no. \nAs discussed above, under Fourth Circuit precedent “[t]he goal [of the ascertainability \nrequirement] is not to ‘identify every class member at the time of certification,’ but to define a \nclass in such a way as to ensure that there will be some ‘administratively feasible [way] for the \ncourt to determine whether a particular individual is a member’ at some point.” Krakauer, 925 \nF.3d at 658. As Plaintiffs point out, “this assessment is not made for mere curiosity, but in order \nto ensure compliance with the Court’s orders.” ECF No. 130 at 11. In a “Rule 23(b)(2) action, \nnotice is not required, and the requested relief (vacatur of the [2019 Redetermination \nMemorandum] and a declaration of its invalidity) will be the same for all class members[,]” \ndecreasing the likelihood that any individualized assessment of precise class membership will be \n26 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 27 of 55\nnecessary. Planned Parenthood of Md., Inc. v. Azar, No. CV CCB-20-00361, 2020 WL 3893241, \nat *5 (D. Md. July 10, 2020) (citing Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 362 (2011) \n(“The Rule provides no opportunity for (b)(1) or (b)(2) class members to opt out, and does not \neven oblige the District Court to afford them notice of the action.”)). Moreover, because the \nmembers of Plaintiffs’ proposed class do not seek any form of monetary damages, the \nprobability that it will be necessary to identify particular individuals as class members is further \nreduced. Id. at *5 n.9.  \nNevertheless, “[i]t is possible that the court might at some point need to decide whether a \nspecific individual is a class member and bound by the court’s judgment or has the power to \nenforce non-compliance with the judgment.” Id. at *5. In this case, however, when that time \ncomes, it will likely be in the context of one of four scenarios: (1) USCIS denies jurisdiction over \nan asylum applicant after determining that at the time of application the applicant did not qualify \nas a UAC; (2) USCIS defers to an IJ’s determination that an asylum applicant was not an UAC at \nthe time of filing and thus denies jurisdiction over the asylum application; (3) ICE advocates that \nan IJ exercise jurisdiction over an asylum applicant because the applicant was not an UAC at the \ntime of filing; or (4) USCIS denies jurisdiction over an asylum applicant that was previously \ndetermined to be a UAC after observing a notation in a government database indicating that the \napplicant was not an UAC at the time of filing. In all four of these scenarios, by the time the \nissue of class membership arises, Defendants will already have made, and documented in their \nrecords, the determinations which Defendants complain will involve “extremely complex factual \nissue[s]” and thus are not “administratively feasible[,]” ECF No. 126 at 13—i.e., whether the \nasylum applicant qualified as a UAC at the time of application.. \nThe circumstances of this case are therefore unlike the situation in EQT Production Co., \n27 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 28 of 55\n764 F.3d 347, the case on which Defendants heavily rely. In EQT Production Co., the Fourth \nCircuit remanded the case for the district court to determine whether the proposed class—“(1) all \npersons or their successors, (2) whom [defendants] have identified as being the owners of the gas \nestate in a tract underlying a [coalbed methane gas (“CBM”)] drilling unit, (3) whose interest in \nthe CBM is ‘in conflict’ because a different person owns the coal estate in the same tract”—was \nascertainable. Id. at 355, 360. The district court had concluded that the court could identify class \nmembers in reference to ownership schedules listing all potential interest holders, but the Fourth \nCircuit noted that some of the ownership schedules were twenty years old and did not reflect \nchanges in ownership such that ownership would have to be resolved based on land records, “a \ncomplicated and individualized process.” Id. at 353, 359. In contrast, here “[t]here is no need for \n‘extensive and individualized fact-finding or ‘mini-trials’’ to determine who [met the definition \nof an UAC at the time of their asylum application].” Planned Parenthood of Md., Inc., 2020 WL \n3893241 at *6 (quoting EQT Prod. Co., 764 F.3d at 358). Rather, by the time the inquiry occurs, \nthe court need only to look to Defendants’ records. See id. \nii.  Vagueness \nDefendants next argue the proposed class fails the threshold ascertainability requirement \nbecause the class “definition is too vague to enable the court to identify a relevant class.” ECF \nNo. 126 at 15. This argument is broken into several parts, all of which are unavailing. \nDefendants first claim that Plaintiffs’ class is too vague to satisfy ascertainability because \n“Plaintiffs fail to identify by whom the UAC determination need be made, under what authority, \nand through which means of documentation in order to identify those individuals who ‘were \ndetermined to be a UAC.’” ECF No. 126 at 15. Plaintiff offers the following satisfactory \nresponse: “determination of UAC status for purpose this class action is clear. The 2013 Kim \n28 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 29 of 55\nMemo, which this action seeks to restore and enforce, specifies that ‘[i]n cases in which CBP or \nICE has already determined that the applicant is a UAC, Asylum Offices will adopt that \ndetermination and take jurisdiction over the case.’” ECF No. 130 at 13 (citation omitted). The \nonly exception is if HHS, CBP, or ICE vacate that determination through an affirmative act. ECF \nNo. 91-4 at 2–3. Thus, there is no ambiguity as to the meaning of “were determined to be an \nUnaccompanied Alien Child[,]” ECF No. 117. Rather, it is clear that CBP and ICE’s \ndeterminations in the first instance that an individual is a UAC and HHS, CBP, and ICE’s \naffirmative acts to vacate those determinations, ECF 91-4 at 2–3, are the designations on which \nthis element of the class definition will rely. \nNext Defendants argue that the class definition is vague because Plaintiffs failed to \nconsider the impact of several different events on elements of the definition: (1) “how a USCIS \ndetermination that it did not have jurisdiction under the 2013 Memo” would affect the “pending” \nnature of the application; (2) how “an applicant’s change of UAC status would affect the \n‘pending’ nature of the application[;]” and (3) “how filing with the EOIR would affect the \noperative filing date in determining whether an individual was an UAC ‘on the date they filed \ntheir asylum application with USCIS.’” ECF No. 126 at 15. However, Defendants fail to explain \nwhat problems they envision and how those events would affect the ascertainability of Plaintiffs’ \nproposed class.  \nDefendants’ final vagueness argument again centers on the term “pending” and whether \nPlaintiffs’ class definition uses the term in the same way that Defendants use it internally. Id. at \n16–18. However, the Court agrees with Plaintiffs that “pending” should be given its ordinary \nmeaning, which is sufficiently clear: “an application is pending during that period between \nsubmission and action taken by USCIS.” ECF No. 130 at 14. Thus, Plaintiffs’ class definition is \n29 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 30 of 55\nnot too vague to enable the court to readily identify members of the class. \nTherefore, Plaintiffs have satisfied their burden of demonstrating that their class \ndefinition meets the threshold “readily identifiable” requirement implicit in Rule 23. See Thorn, \n445 F.3d at 317 (“[P]laintiffs bear the burden . . . of demonstrating satisfaction of the Rule 23 \nrequirements” (quoting Gariety v. Grant Thornton, LLP, 368 F.3d 356, 370 (4th Cir. 2004))). \n2.  Commonality \n “To establish commonality, the party seeking certification must ‘demonstrate that the \nclass members have suffered the same injury’ and that their claims ‘depend upon a common \ncontention.’” Boyd v. Coventry Health Care Inc., 299 F.R.D. 451, 458 (D. Md. 2014) (quoting \nDukes, 564 U.S. at 350). “The inquiry is not whether common questions of law or fact \npredominate, but only whether such questions exist.” Hewlett, 185 F.R.D. at 216. “Minor \ndifferences in the underlying facts of individual class members’ cases do not defeat a showing of \ncommonality where there are common questions of law.” Id. “Thus, the commonality \nrequirement is not a high bar[.]” Minter v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 274 F.R.D. 525, 533 (D. Md. \n2011). \nHere, Plaintiffs seek adjudication of a single legal issue that is common to all class \nmembers: whether the 2019 Redetermination Memo is unlawful. ECF No. 91 at 41. This issue \nhas several subsidiary questions: (i) whether the 2019 Redetermination Memo is arbitrary and \ncapricious under the APA; (ii) whether the 2019 Redetermination Memo violates the TVPRA; \n(iii) whether the 2019 Redetermination Memo violates due process; (iv) whether Defendants \nfailed to comply with notice-and-comment rulemaking, as required by the APA, by issuing the \n2019 Redetermination Memo; (v) whether Defendants’ policy of deferring to an EOIR \ndetermination as to whether an asylum applicant is a UAC, as outlined in Footnote 5 of the 2019 \n30 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 31 of 55\nRedetermination Memo, is arbitrary and capricious; and (iv) whether Defendants’ adoption of \nthe policy of deferral to EOIR determinations violated the APA. Id. ¶¶ 152–179. The 2019 \nRedetermination Memo and the policies that it outlines, including deference to EOIR \ndeterminations, govern USCIS’s consideration of all asylum applications filed by applicants \nformerly determined to be UACs, including applications filed by proposed class members. All \nproposed class members are subject to, and fear, the same result: USCIS denying jurisdiction \nover their application based on policies that deviate from the policies outlined in the 2013 Kim \nMemo, on which the class members had previously relied. All proposed class members seek the \nsame relief: a declaration that those policies are unlawful and an order permanently enjoining \nDefendants from implementing them.  \nIn contesting the commonality requirement, Defendants argue that: (1) the legality, in \nsubstance and in process, of the 2019 Redetermination Memo and its subsidiary questions are not \ncommon to the entire class because these “are not questions that currently affect any applicants \nwho have filed with USCIS because USCIS had rescinded the 2019 Memo, retracted all its \njurisdictional determinations under it, and has not applied it to any case since it was rescinded[,]” \nECF no. 126 at 19; (2) “[w]hether USCIS may deny jurisdiction based on novel ‘affirmative \nacts’ such as EOIR jurisdictional determinations . . . is not a question common to all members of \nthe proposed class because not all individuals so described have received EOIR jurisdictional \ndeterminations[,]” id.; (3) Plaintiffs’ proposed class does not satisfy commonality because \n“members of the proposed class are in a variety of procedural postures regarding their asylum \napplications[,]” id. at 20; and (4) the proposed class does not satisfy commonality because “a \nclass action is not the appropriate method for resolving Plaintiffs’ alleged Due Process harms[,]” \nid. at 21. The Court disagrees. \n31 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 32 of 55\nDefendants’ first commonality argument can easily be discarded. This Court has already \nheld that—regarding Plaintiffs’ requests that the Court declare the 2019 Redetermination \nMemorandum unlawful, that it be vacated, and that Defendants be enjoined from “enforcing or \napplying any aspect of the 2019 Redetermination Memo[,]” ECF No. 91 at 41–4—“Plaintiffs \nha[ve] not obtained all of the relief they [seek.]” ECF No. 115 at 33. This was true before \nPlaintiffs filed the Amended Complaint, and especially after. Id. While Defendants now assert \nthat the 2019 Redetermination Memo has been rescinded, ECF No. 126 at 19, it is not clear that \nagreeing to the injunction and providing notice on the USCIS website that USCIS may not rely \non the 2019 Redetermination Memo to reject jurisdiction over any asylum application filed by a \nUAC is tantamount to a formal rescission that carries the force of law. See ECF No. 126-2 ¶ 10. \nMoreover, proposed class members are all still subject to the same risk that, before USCIS \nreviews their applications on its merits, an IJ will make a finding that they were not a UAC at the \ntime of filing their asylum application—perhaps as a result of ICE advocacy—and thus USCIS \nwill deny jurisdiction over their application while still maintaining that USCIS no longer relies \non the 2019 Redetermination Memo to accept or reject jurisdiction over an applicant. \nDefendants’ second and third commonality arguments can be combined into a single \nargument that Plaintiffs’ lack commonality because they are “in a variety of procedural postures \nregarding their asylum applications.” ECF No. 126 at 20. That argument, too, is unavailing. \n“Commonality does not require class members to share all issues in the suit, but simply a single \ncommon issue,” and “[t]hus, factual differences among members’ cases will not preclude \ncertification if the class members share the same legal theory.” Bullock v. Bd. of Educ. of \nMontgomery Cty., 210 F.R.D. 556, 560 (D. Md. 2002) (emphasis in original). Here, the \npurported differences among proposed class members are not determinative of the legal issues \n32 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 33 of 55\nthat Plaintiffs present in the case. Again, all members of the proposed class are subject to, and \nfear, the same result—denial of their asylum application based on policies that were not lawfully \npromulgated and that depart from those on which they relied—and seek the same relief. Class \nmembers do not ask the Court to determine whether their asylum applications should be \napproved by USCIS, an inquiry to which the purported differences could be relevant. Rather, \nthey simply request the opportunity to have their asylum applications considered by USCIS \nunder lawfully promulgated policies, and they ask the Court to determine that Defendants’ \ncurrent variations from the policies outlined in the 2013 Kim Memo, on which proposed class \nmembers relied, are unlawful in process and in substance. Such an outcome would not entitle \nproposed class members to any specific outcome in their asylum applications, and the fact that \nsome class members may have their applications rejected for other reasons does not impact the \nCourt’s assessment of this common legal issue. \nDefendants’ final commonality argument is that, under Supreme Court precedent as \narticulated in Jennings v. Rodriguez, 138 S. Ct. 830, 852 (2018), a class action is not the \nappropriate method for resolving Plaintiffs’ alleged due process harms because of the flexibility \nof the due process analysis combined with the proposed class’s inclusion of “UACs whose \nasylum applications USCIS would not have adjudicated on the merits even under the 2013 \nMemo[.]” ECF No. 126 at 21–22. Defendants argue that the dissimilarities in the Plaintiffs’ \nproposed class “would require the Court to engage in fact-intensive analyses of each putative \nclass member.” Id. at 22. However, this argument also fails to convince the Court.  \nFirst, as Plaintiffs note, the Supreme Court in Jennings v. Rodriguez did not state a class \naction cannot be certified if it pursues a due process claim. ECF No. 130 at 19; see Jennings, 138 \nS. Ct. at 852. Rather, it merely suggested that “some members of the certified class may not be \n33 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 34 of 55\nentitled to bond hearings[, i.e., the requested remedy,] as a constitutional matter.” Id. Moreover, \nthe instant case is distinguishable. Here, regardless of whether all proposed class members would \nhave had their asylum applications adjudicated on the merits under the 2013 Kim Memo, there is \na single inquiry and a single relief requested; whether applying the 2019 Redetermination \nMemorandum and associated policies retroactively to asylum applicants who had already filed \nviolates the Due Process clause, and, if so, whether the application of the Memorandum should \nbe enjoined. This inquiry and relief does not “require the Court to engage in fact-intensive \nanalyses of each putative class member.” ECF No. 126 at 22. \n3.  Typicality \n“Typicality determines whether a sufficient relationship exists between the injury to the \nnamed plaintiff and the conduct affecting the class, so that the court may properly attribute a \ncollective nature to the challenged conduct.” Hewlett, 185 F.R.D. at 217. “[T]he ‘plaintiff’s \nclaim cannot be so different from the claims of absent class members that their claims will not be \nadvanced by plaintiff’s proof of his own individual claim.’” Edmondson v. Eagle Nat’l Bank, \n336 F.R.D. 108, 116 (D. Md. 2020) (quoting Dieter v. Microsoft Corp., 436 F.3d 461, 466 (4th \nCir. 2006)). A “claim may differ factually and still be ‘typical’ of the claims of class members if \nit arises from the same event or practice or course of conduct that gives rise to the claims of other \nclass members[.]” Bullock, 210 F.R.D. at 560 (internal quotation marks omitted); see Ealy v. \nPinkerton Gov’t Servs., Inc., 514 F. App’x 299, 305 (4th Cir. 2013) (internal citations omitted) \n(“Although a representative’s claims and the claims of other members of the class need not be \n‘perfectly identical or perfectly aligned,’ the representative’s pursuit of his own interests ‘must \nsimultaneously tend to advance the interests of the absent class members.’”). As Defendants \nnote, the inquiries under the typicality and commonality requirements of Rule 23(a) “tend to \n34 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 35 of 55\nmerge.” Gen. Tel. Co. of the Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 157 n.13 (1982).  \nDefendants argue that typicality has not been met because “jurisdiction has not yet been \ndetermined for many of those described in the proposed class” and “[w]ithout jurisdictional \ndecisions, the Plaintiffs cannot assert that the 2019 Memo has been applied to them.” ECF No. \n126 at 22. Defendants further argue that because Defendants “have [allegedly] retracted \ndecisions applying the 2019 Memo to decline USCIS jurisdiction for all of the named Plaintiffs \nas well as for all applications pending before it” and have instead “applied the 2013 Memo to all \nof these cases[,]” Plaintiffs cannot assert that the 2019 Memo has been applied to them. Id. at \n22–23. Finally, Defendants argue that the different procedural postures of the proposed class \nmembers defeat typicality. Id. at 23. None of these arguments are persuasive.  \nAs Plaintiffs point out, and as already analyzed in the Court’s commonality discussion, \n“[r]egardless of their individual differences, each prospective class member pursues the same \nclaims for the same result[,]” ECF No. 130 at 20–21: a declaration that the 2019 Redetermination \nMemo and associated policies are unlawful, both in substance and in process, and an order \nenjoining the application of those policies. “Whether a prospective class member has already \nreceived a jurisdictional denial based on the 2019 Redetermination Memorandum or has a \npending application but meets the criteria that would warrant denial under the 2019 \nRedetermination memorandum, each has the same unified interest in not having that policy \napplied to their asylum application.” ECF No. 130 at 21. This is true even if some proposed class \nmembers might eventually have their asylum applications denied for other reasons. Thus, \ntypicality is met. See Edmondson, 336 F.R.D. at 1177 (finding typicality despite potential \ndifferences in class members’ claims, as “the kickback scheme described by Plaintiffs would be \nviolative of RESPA (if proven), regardless of whether an individual class member had engaged \n35 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 36 of 55\nin first-time financing or refinancing”).9 \n4.  Other Factors \nAlthough Defendants do not challenge numerosity, fair representation, or whether the \nclass meets the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2), the court has an independent obligation to ensure \nthat these prerequisites are met. Thorn, 445 F.3d at 318 (“district courts must conduct a rigorous \nanalysis to ensure compliance with Rule 23, paying careful attention to the requirements of [that] \nRule” (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)).  \nThe proposed class meets the numerosity requirement. “To satisfy the numerosity \nrequirement, the proposed class must be so numerous that ‘joinder of all members is \nimpracticable.’” Amaya v. DGS Constr., LLC, 326 F.R.D. 439, 446 (D. Md. 2018) (quoting Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 23(a)(1)). The Fourth Circuit has said that 74 members is “well within the range \nappropriate for class certification,” Brady v. Thurston Motor Lines, 726 F.2d 136, 145 (4th Cir. \n1984), and has upheld the certification of a class with as few as 18 members, Cypress v. Newport \nNews Gen. & Nonsectarian Hosp. Ass’n, 375 F.2d 648, 653 (4th Cir. 1967). USCIS records \nreflect that, at the end of March 2019, there were 27,106 pending asylum cases filed under the \ninitial jurisdiction provision of the TVPRA while applicants were in removal proceedings, ECF \nNo. 117-1 at 11 (citing U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Servs., MPA and PRL Report – Fiscal \nYear 2019 (2019), https://www.uscis.gov/outreach/asylum-division-quarterly-stakeholder-\nmeeting-10; U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Servs., Asylum Statistics Key (2019), \nhttp://wwww.uscis.gov/outreach/asylum-division-quarterly-stakeholder-meeting-10), and, \naccording to a public statement by USCIS, it is likely that a substantial portion of these \n \n9 To the extent Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ proposed class fails to meet the requirements of typicality for the \nreasons Defendants’ articulated regarding commonality, those arguments fail for the reasons discussed in the \nCommonality section.

The thousands of UACs who submitted these \napplications come from throughout the country and joinder of all members is impracticable.10  \nThere is adequate representation under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4). “Representation is \nadequate if: (1) the named plaintiffs’ interests are not opposed to those of other class members, \nand (2) the plaintiffs’ attorneys are qualified, experienced and able to conduct the litigation.” \nPlanned Parenthood of Md., Inc., 2020 WL 3893241 at *7. Here, there does not appear to be any \nconflict between the named plaintiffs and the other class members, see ECF No. 117-4; ECF No. \n117-5; ECF No. 117-6; ECF No. 117-8, and counsel is qualified and experienced, see ECF No. \n117-9; ECF No. 117-10; ECF No. 117-11; ECF No. 117-12; ECF No. 117-13; ECF No. 117-14; \nECF No. 117-15; ECF No. 117-16. \nFinally, Rule 23(b)(2) is met. Rule 23(b)(2) provides that a class action may be \nmaintained if “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds generally \napplicable to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is \nappropriate respecting the class as a whole . . . .” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). “The key to the (b)(2) \nclass is the indivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory remedy warranted—the notion that \nthe conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the class \n \n10 At the very least, as of October 9, 2019, “[t]he Asylum Offices have identified 192 cases where the 2019 memo \nwas applied.” ECF No. 77-2 at 4. Moreover, “[t]he A files [were] being retrieved still [and thus the Government \nacknowledged that the] 192 number may therefore rise a bit.” Id. These proposed class members alone would satisfy \nthe requirements of numerosity. \n37 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 38 of 55\nmembers or as to none of them.” Dukes, 564 U.S. at 360 (citation and internal quotation marks \nomitted); see also Fed.

P. 23, Advisory Committee Note to 1966 Amendment of \nSubdivision (b)(2) (“Action or inaction is directed to a class within the meaning of [Rule \n23(b)(2)] even if it has taken effect or is threatened only as to one or a few members of the class, \nprovided it is based on ground which have general application to the class.”). Because the 2019 \nRedetermination Memo and associated policies apply generally to the class, and the requested \nrelief—declaring the Memorandum and policy unlawful under the APA and/or the Due Process \nclause and preventing Defendants from applying those policies—“would provide the same relief \nto all class members[,]” Plaintiffs’ proposed class meets the requirements of Fed.

Md. July 15, 2020) (emphasis in \noriginal) (quoting Favia v.

Antitrust Litig., 333 F.3d \n517, 525 (4th Cir. 2003).

Thus, the \nburden placed upon Plaintiffs to state a claim for a preliminary injunction is high.  \nThe Supreme Court and the Fourth Circuit recognize that, in order to receive a \npreliminary injunction, a plaintiff must establish: \n[(1)] he is likely to succeed on the merits, [(2)] that he is likely to suffer \nirreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, [(3)] that the balance of \nequities tips in his favor, and [(4)] that an injunction is in the public interest. \nDewhurst, 649 F.3d at 290. All four requirements must be met in order for a preliminary \n40 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 41 of 55\ninjunction to be granted. See id. However, the final two factors generally “merge when the \nGovernment is the opposing party.” Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). \nAs discussed above, Plaintiffs have requested the Court essentially expand the current \ninjunction to include three of Defendants’ alleged practices and policies. The Court will analyze \neach policy separately. \n    1.  USCIS’s Deference to IJ’s Jurisdictional Determinations \n      a.  Reconsideration is Appropriate under Rule 54(b) \nPlaintiffs argue that, under Rule 54(b), it is appropriate for this Court to amend its \npreliminary injunction order and enjoin defendants from deferring to IJs’ jurisdictional \ndeterminations because new evidence “indicates that more specific prohibitions are required to \nprotect prospective class members while this case is still pending.” ECF No. 124-1 at 15. \nAdditionally, Plaintiffs argue that—since this Court initially entered its injunction  to “protect the \nstatus quo and to prevent irreparable harm during the pendency of a lawsuit, ultimately to \npreserve the court’s ability to render a meaningful judgment on the merits[,]” ECF No. 124-1 at \n15 (quoting ECF No. 54 at 7)—it would be manifestly unjust for some proposed class members, \n“who would share in the relief afforded by a favorable resolution of the claims in the Amended \nComplaint, to be excluded from the preliminary injunction and thus potentially subject to \nremoval before those claims could proceed to judgment.” ECF No. 124-1 at 15. \nDefendants respond that, “[a]s a threshold matter, this motion . . . should be denied \nbecause no new evidence has become available since the preliminary injunction was entered[.]” \nECF No. 127 at 14. According to Defendants, “the IJ deferral practice predated the 2019 Memo, \n[and thus] its application cannot be considered ‘new evidence’ making amendment to the \npreliminary injunction [in]appropriate before the resolution of this case on the merits.” ECF No. \n41 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 42 of 55\n127 at 15. Rather, Defendants characterize Plaintiffs’ Motion as simply “repackage[ing] a \nrequest this Court has already denied[.]” Id. Defendants, however, do not address Plaintiffs’ \nargument that this Court should amend the preliminary injunction in order to prevent a manifest \ninjustice. \nFirst, the Court disagrees with Defendants that Plaintiffs’ motion is simply a repackaged \nMotion to Enforce. As Plaintiffs’ note, this Court denied Plaintiffs’ Motion to Enforce “without \nprejudice . . . to Plaintiffs’ right to move for emergency equitable relief to enjoin enforcement of \nthe IJ deferral policy if Plaintiffs believe such enforcement threatens impending irreparable \nharm.” ECF No. 134 at 6 (quoting ECF No. 115 at 24–25). Moreover, this Court, in denying \nPlaintiffs’ Motion to Enforce, declined to decide whether the IJ deferral policy was consistent \nwith the TVPRA, Defendants’ past practice, and the APA because it would “narrow [the] issues \npresented by the Amended Complaint without the benefit of the record and briefing that \nlitigating the Amended Complaint would entail.” ECF No. 115 at 24. The current Motion elicits \na different analysis; resolving Plaintiffs’ Motion to Amend the Preliminary Injunction only \nrequires the Court to find that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits and that proposed \nclass members are likely to suffer irreparable harm if Defendants’ policy is not enjoined. See \nDewhurst, 649 F.3d at 290. \nWith respect to Plaintiffs’ two proposed bases for a Rule 54(b) Motion—the availability \nof new evidence and the need to prevent a manifest injustice—the Court finds that, to the extent \nPlaintiffs can satisfy each element of the preliminary injunction standard, amending the \npreliminary injunction to enjoin the Defendants’ policy of deference to IJs’ jurisdictional \ndeterminations is necessary to correct a manifest injustice. “The exception for manifest injustice \nappears to be concerned essentially with fairness in the administrative process[,]” Kasey v. \n42 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 43 of 55\nSullivan, 3 F.3d 75, 79 (4th Cir. 1993) (discussing the standard for Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e), which \nthis court has used to guide the analysis under Rule 54(b)), and this Court agrees with Plaintiffs \nthat it would be manifestly unfair for some proposed class members, “who would share in the \nrelief afforded by a favorable resolution of the claims in the Amended Complaint, to be excluded \nfrom the preliminary injunction and thus potentially subject to removal before those claims could \nproceed to judgment.”11 ECF No. 124-1 at 15. Because the Court finds that this Motion is \nproperly brought under Rule 54(b) to prevent a manifest injustice, it is not necessary to address \nthe parties’ dispute regarding whether there is “new evidence.” \nb.  Plaintiffs are Entitled to a Preliminary Injunction \nDespite this Court’s finding that a Rule 54(b) Motion is proper, to be entitled to the relief \nthey request, Plaintiffs still must show that enjoining USCIS’s deferral policy is appropriate \nunder the preliminary injunction standard. Plaintiffs must show they are likely to succeed on the \nmerits—i.e., it is likely that USCIS’s deferral policy is unlawful—and that proposed class \nmembers are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction. \ni.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \n  The grant of a preliminary injunction is an “extraordinary remedy that may only be \nawarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.” Dewhurst, 649 F.3d at \n290 (quoting Winter, 555 U.S. at 22). Thus, the burden placed upon Plaintiffs to show that each \nrequirement of a preliminary injunction is met is high. Consequently, merely “providing \nsufficient factual allegations to meet the [Fed. R. Civ. P.] 12(b)(6) standard of Twombly and \n \n11 In alignment with the legal authority, this inequity did not arise until after the initial preliminary injunction and it \ndoes not appear that Plaintiffs anticipated this result at the time of the original injunction. Brightview Grp., LP, 2020 \nWL 4003168 at *5; 11A Charles Alan Wright, et al., Federal Practice and Procedure § 2961. For example, USCIS \nreopened E.D.G.’s case based on this Court’s preliminary injunction on August 5, 2019, only for USCIS to again \nreject initial jurisdiction over E.D.G.’s asylum application “on the grounds that the ‘Immigration Judge made an \naffirmative act to terminate UAC status on October 10, 2018’ (almost 10 months after he filed the application with \nthe USCIS).” ECF No. 124-1 at 9–10.  \n43 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 44 of 55\nIqbal” does not show a likelihood of success on the merits. Allstate Ins. Co. v. Warns, No. CIV. \nCCB-11-1846, 2012 WL 681792, at *14 (D. Md. Feb. 29, 2012). Moreover, “[c]ourts have \ndeclined to issue a preliminary injunction when there are significant factual disputes.” Chattery \nInt’l, Inc. v. JoLida, Inc., No. CIV. WDQ-10-2236, 2011 WL 1230822, at *9 (D. Md. Mar. 28, \n2011); see also Torres Advanced Enter. Sols., LLC v. Mid-Atl. Prof’ls Inc., No. PWG-12-3679, \n2013 WL 531215, at *3 (D. Md. Feb. 8, 2013). Defendants articulate two arguments why \nPlaintiffs have not met this high bar: (1) Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits because \n“the IJ deferral practice predated and arose separately from the 2019 Memo[,]” ECF No. 127 at \n17; and (2) the BIA’s ruling in MACO dictated that “USCIS had no choice but to defer to an IJ \nassessment that a person was not a UAC on her filing date when an IJ made such an \nassessment[,]” id. at 17–18. \n  As to the first argument, while there is no disputing that the deferral policy was \nmemorialized in Footnote 5 of the 2019 Redetermination Memo, the parties disagree as to when \nthe policy first changed. Importantly, however, it is also undisputed that this deferral practice \nwas binding on “any USCIS decision” regarding jurisdiction over an asylum case, ECF No. 91-1 \nat 2 (emphasis in original), and was adopted, at some juncture, without the benefit of notice-and-\ncomment rulemaking. \n  As explained in this Court’s Memorandum Opinion granting Plaintiffs’ original Motion \nfor a TRO, under the APA, legislative rules must go through notice-and-comment rulemaking \nbefore they become effective. See 5 U.S.C. § 553(a)–(c); Children’s Hosp. of the King’s \nDaughters, Inc. v. Azar, 896 F.3d 615, 619–20 (4th Cir. 2019). This requirement does not apply \nto interpretive rules. Children’s Hosp, 896 F.3d at 620. A rule is “legislative,” rather than \n“interpretive,” if it “effects a substantive change in existing law or policy.” Id. When a rule \n44 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 45 of 55\naffects “individual rights and obligations” it is “a substantive rule—or a ‘legislative-type rule.’” \nChrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 302 (1979) (internal citation omitted) (quoting Morton v. \nRuiz, 415 U.S. 199, 232, 236 (1974)). Additionally, legislative rules “are rules issued by agencies \npursuant to statutory authority and which implement the statute[.]” Chen Zhou Chai v. Carroll, \n48 F.3d 1331, 1340 (4th Cir. 1995). Because Defendants’ policy of deferral, regardless of when \nit was adopted, did not go through the notice-and-comment procedure, the question for the Court \nis whether it is a legislative or interpretive rule. \n  Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in demonstrating the deferral policy is legislative in nature \nbecause the policy—regardless of whether it was adopted before the 2019 Redetermination \nMemo—is inconsistent with prior agency policy, as articulated in the 2013 Kim Memo, and thus \ncaused a “substantive change in existing law or policy.” Children’s Hosp, 896 F.3d at 620. \nPursuant to the deferral policy, USCIS officers must now defer to an IJ’s jurisdictional \ndetermination, if one exists, even if that determination was made after the UAC filed their \nasylum application with the USCIS. This appears to be inconsistent with the clear instructions in \nthe 2013 Kim Memo that “[i]n cases in which CBP or ICE [have] already determined the \napplicant is a UAC” and there is not “an affirmative act by HHS, ICE or CBP to terminate the \nUAC finding before the applicant filed the initial application for asylum, Asylum Offices will \nadopt the previous DHS determination that the applicant was a UAC.” ECF No. 91-4 at 3 \n(emphasis added). Under the deferral policy, E.D.G. or similar individuals, who under the plain \nlanguage of the 2013 Kim Memo would have had their asylum application considered by USCIS, \nwhere techniques and procedures sensitive to the needs and challenges of UACs are employed, \nECF No. 54 at 2–3, are now at risk of USCIS denying jurisdiction in deference to an IJ \ndetermination. Thus, Plaintiffs will likely be able to establish that the USCIS’s policy of \n45 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 46 of 55\ndeferring to IJs’ jurisdictional determinations is a change in policy and should have gone through \nnotice-and-comment.  \n  Defendants’ argument that the BIA ruling in MACO requires deference is also \nunpersuasive. As Plaintiffs point out, this argument presents “an entirely new position that is \ncontradicted by the 2019 Redetermination Memorandum itself and Defendants’ earlier positions \nin this litigation.” ECF No. 134 at 9. The 2019 Redetermination Memo explains: “The BIA’s \ndecision [in MACO] . . . does not divest USCIS of its authority to determine whether an \napplication before it was filed by a UAC, such that USCIS has jurisdiction over it. Rather, both \nthe Immigration Judge and USCIS have authority to make this jurisdictional determination.” \nECF No. 91-1 at 3; see also ECF No. 128-31 at US-000282 (agenda for May 2019 USCIS \nAsylum Division Quarterly Meeting, stating MACO “addresses immigration judge \ndeterminations as to whether an asylum application was filed by a UAC” but “does not address \nUSCIS determinations about its own jurisdiction. USCIS continues to make its jurisdictional \ndeterminations under its own procedures.”). Thus, Defendants argument that MACO “is binding \non USCIS and requires that, where an IJ has determined that the TVPRA’s jurisdictional \nprovision . . . does not apply, USCIS must defer to that determination[,]” ECF No. 127 at 20, \nfails.12  \nii.  Irreparable Harm \nPlaintiffs have also met their burden to demonstrate that USCIS’s policy of deferring to \nIJs’ jurisdictional determinations will cause irreparable harm if this Court does not grant \nPlaintiffs’ Motion to Amend the Preliminary Injunction. Plaintiff E.D.G.’s precarious position is \n \n12 Because Plaintiffs’ are likely to succeed on their claim that USCIS’s policy of deferring to IJs’ jurisdictional \ndeterminations violates the notice-and-comment requirements of the APA, it is unnecessary to consider whether \nPlaintiffs’ other claims that the deferral policy is unlawful are meritorious. \n46 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 47 of 55\ndemonstrative. “E.D.G.’s appeal of his asylum denial is pending before the BIA, and if the BIA \ndismisses his appeal, he will have a final, enforceable removal order[,]” and may be removed \nbefore this Court is able to rule on the merits of the parties’ cross-motions for summary \njudgment. ECF No. 124-1 at 19. Removal constitutes irreparable harm, see Sanchez v. \nMcAleenan, No. GJH-19-1728, 2020 WL 607032, at *7 (D. Md. 2020); Tefel v. Reno, 972 F. \nSupp. 609, 619 (S.D. Fla. 1997), and, in the absence of preliminary injunctive relief, proposed \nclass members similarly situated to E.D.G. will likely continue to be removed and will later have \na difficult time returning to the United States even if Plaintiffs and the proposed class receive a \nfavorable ruling. A preliminary injunction will therefore maintain the status quo and ensure that \nasylum applicants whose applications allegedly should have been reviewed on the merits by \nUSCIS under the 2013 Kim Memo can actually benefit from any final ruling in their favor. \nDefendants’ insistence that “there is no immediate risk of removal[,]” ECF No. 127 at 7, does \nnot convince the Court otherwise. Defendants fail to offer any timeline for how far E.D.G. might \nbe from the conclusion of removal proceedings and do not contest the declaration of Miguel \nMariscal, stating, “I anticipate that within weeks of the BIA decision ICE would issue a ‘bag and \nbaggage’ letter requiring E.D.G. to report to ICE with his belongings for removal to \nHonduras[,]” ECF No. 124-3 ¶ 21; see also ECF No. 124-1 at 19–20. ECF No. 134 at 16–17.  \nIn addition, Defendants do not dispute that some proposed class members, who delayed \nfiling their asylum applications in reliance on Defendants’ 2013 Kim Memo, may lose their \nopportunity to pursue asylum entirely if USCIS defers to an IJ determination that the class \nmember was not a UAC at the time of the application. As discussed in the background section of \nthis Memorandum Opinion, UACs are exempted from the one-year bar for filing an asylum \napplication. If an IJ determines a proposed class member was not a UAC at the time of filing his \n47 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 48 of 55\nor her asylum application, accepts jurisdiction over the application, denies such application \nbecause the application was filed past the one year mark, and USCIS then defers to the IJ’s \njurisdictional determination, that proposed class member will lose their opportunity to pursue \nasylum entirely. \niii.  Balance of Equities \nAnalysis of the last two factors—the balance of equities and the public interest—merge \nhere because the Government is the opposing party. Nken, 556 U.S. at 435. Substantially \nidentical to this Court’s conclusion in its Memorandum Opinion granting the original TRO, \n“[t]here is no evidence in the existing record that either Defendants or children applying for \nasylum will be harmed by pressing pause on enforcing [USCIS’s policy of deferral to IJ’s \njurisdictional determination,] . . . but Plaintiffs have shown that the new policy will cause them \nharm.” ECF No. 54 at 15. Thus, at this time, the balance of the harms favors a preliminarily \nenjoining USCIS’s deferral policy. \nThe Court grants Plaintiffs’ Motion to Amend the Preliminary Injunction to the extent \nthey request that this Court enjoin USCIS’s policy of deferring to IJ jurisdictional \ndeterminations. \n2.  ICE’s Advocacy Against USCIS Jurisdiction in Removal Proceedings \n      a.  Reconsideration is Appropriate under Rule 54(b) \n  Plaintiffs’ Motion to Amend the Preliminary Injunction in order to enjoin ICE’s advocacy \nagainst USCIS jurisdiction in removal proceedings is also properly brought under Rule 54(b) \nbecause an amendment to this Court’s preliminary injunction will prevent a manifest injustice. \nSee Scalia v. Peters, 2020 WL 4734414, at *1. \nPlaintiffs argue ICE should not be able to implement policies that this Court has enjoined \n48 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 49 of 55\nby advocating against USCIS jurisdiction in removal proceedings in circumstances where USCIS \nshould accept initial jurisdiction over the asylum application under the 2013 Kim Memo. This \nCourt agrees and finds that it would be manifestly unjust to require Plaintiffs and proposed class \nmembers to defend their asylum application in an adversarial setting—rather than the non-\nadversarial forum that the TVPRA promises them—because of ICE’s implementation of policies \nthat this Court has enjoined. \nb.  Plaintiffs are Entitled to a Preliminary Injunction \ni.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nPlaintiffs’ claim regarding ICE’s advocacy is intertwined with behavior by Defendants \nthat this Court has already enjoined. Thus—with regard to the success on the merits element of \nthe preliminary injunction standard—Plaintiffs’ request that the Court amend the preliminary \ninjunction to enjoin ICE from advocating in immigration court for IJs to exercise jurisdiction \nover asylum applications filed by UACs cannot be analytically separated from Plaintiffs’ \npreviously granted request that this Court enjoin USCIS’s implementation of the 2019 \nRedetermination Memo and Plaintiffs’ most recent request that this Court enjoin USCIS’s \ndeferral to IJ jurisdictional determinations. As this Court recognized in its Memorandum Opinion \ndenying Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint, “Plaintiffs have set forth an \nAPA claim against ICE and Acting Director Albence based on their implementation of those \npolicies[.]” ECF No. 115 at 39 (emphasis added). In short, Defendants should not advocate for \noutcomes that are inconsistent with the Court’s injunction. Thus, if Plaintiffs are likely to \nsucceed on the merits as to their claims regarding USCIS’s application of the 2019 \nRedetermination Memo and the deferral policy, then Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their \n49 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 50 of 55\nclaim against ICE as well.13  \n        ii.  Irreparable Harm \n  The Court finds convincing Plaintiffs’ argument that ICE’s advocacy against USCIS \njurisdiction in removal proceedings will result in irreparable harm and Defendants provide no \nrebuttal. If an IJ accepts ICE’s arguments in immigration court, presented in opposition to the \npolicy of its sister agency within DHS, and decides that it has jurisdiction to evaluate a UAC’s \nasylum application, the UAC must defend his asylum claim in immigration court, subject to \ncross-examination and without the benefit of USCIS’ child-sensitive and trauma-informed \ninterview techniques. ECF No. 124-1 at 22–23. Even if the UAC later succeeds in bringing his \nasylum application before USCIS, the experience of reliving his trauma in the face of hostile \ninterrogation cannot be erased. Accordingly, regardless of whether this Court orders USIC not to \ndefer to IJ jurisdictional determinations—which it does here—ICE’s advocacy may still result in \nmembers of the proposed class suffering irreparable harm. Thus, Plaintiffs have satisfied the \nirreparable harm element as required by the preliminary injunction standard. \n        iii.  Balance of Equities \n  Again this Court’s reasoning in its Memorandum Opinion granting the TRO applies with \nequal force here: “[t]here is no evidence in the existing record that either Defendants or children \napplying for asylum will be harmed by pressing pause on [ICE’s advocacy against USCIS in \nremoval proceedings,] . . . but Plaintiffs have shown that the new policy will cause them harm.” \nECF No. 54 at 15. Thus, the balance of equities tips in favor of amending this Court’s \n \n13 Defendants’ sole argument against this Court enjoining ICE’s advocacy against USCIS jurisdiction is that \nPlaintiffs are attempting to add a named plaintiff, J.S.C.G., without amending the Amended Complaint and that, \nregardless, the new Plaintiff does not have standing. ECF No. 127 at 12–14. However, J.S.C.G.’s circumstances are \nsolely illustrative of allegations that are already explicitly pled in the Amended Complaint, ECF No. 91 ¶ 108, the \ndismissal of which this Court has already denied. ECF No. 115 at 38–40.  \n50 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 51 of 55\npreliminary injunction. \n  The Court grants Plaintiffs Motion to Amend the Preliminary Injunction in so far as they \nrequest the injunction of ICE’s advocacy against USCIS jurisdiction in removal proceedings. \n3.  USCIS’s Policy of Denying Jurisdiction over a Child’s Asylum \nApplication Based on an Alleged “Affirmative Act” Involving a Mere \nNotation that the Child Has Been Reunited with a Parent or Legal \nGuardian or Has Turned 18 Years Old \n  The 2013 Kim Memo instructed USCIS asylum officers to accept initial jurisdiction over \nasylum applications filed by those previously determined to be a UAC, “[u]nless there was an \naffirmative act by HHS, ICE, or CBP to terminate the UAC finding before the applicant filed the \ninitial application for asylum.” ECF No. 91-4 at 3 (emphasis added). In particular, “even if there \nappears to be evidence that the applicant may have turned 18 years of age or may have reunited \nwith a parent or legal guardian since the CBP or ICE determination[,]” the 2013 Kim Memo \ndirected asylum officers to accept initial jurisdiction. Id. The 2019 Redetermination Memo \nchanged this policy by directing asylum officers to re-examine UAC status in all cases and to \ndecline initial jurisdiction if they concluded that the asylum applicant had turned 18 or been \nreunited with a parent or legal guardian at the time they filed their asylum application. See ECF \nNo. 91-1 at 4–5. This Court has since enjoined USCIS’s implementation of the 2019 \nRedetermination Memo. ECF No. 71. \nHowever, Plaintiffs now argue that USCIS continues to reject jurisdiction over asylum \napplications based on a child’s reunification with a parent or legal guardian or attainment of 18 \nyears of age, ECF No. 124-1 at 24, and does so on the theory that “an agent’s notation in a \ngovernment record or database reflecting the child’s age or reunification constitutes an \n‘affirmative act . . . to terminate the UAC finding before the applicant filed the initial application \nfor asylum.’” Id. (quoting ECF No. 91-4 at 3). Plaintiffs’ request to enjoin this particular practice \n51 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 52 of 55\nfails primarily because it asserts a claim not made in its Amended Complaint.   \nIn the Motion to Amend the Preliminary Injunction, Plaintiffs question whether \nDefendants are violating the 2013 Kim Memo by treating documents where evidence of the \nUAC’s age or reunification with parents has been recorded as an “affirmative act.” ECF No. 124-\n1 at 24. In essence, therefore, Plaintiffs disagree with USCIS’s construction of the 2013 Kim \nMemo, not the validity of the 2019 Redetermination Memo that is at issue in the Amended \nComplaint. The 2013 Kim Memo does, in fact, permit denial of jurisdiction by UCIS in the event \nof an affirmative act by HHS, ICE, or CBP to terminate the UAC finding. A notation made in the \nsystem may or may not qualify as such an act, but that is a separate question from whether the \npolicy has changed as a result of the 2019 Redetermination Memo. Plaintiffs may not raise new \nclaims through motions without amending their complaint. See Harris v. Reston Hosp. Ctr., LLC, \n523 F. App’x 938, 946 (4th Cir. 2013); Cloaninger ex rel. Estate of Cloaninger v. McDevitt, 555 \nF.3d 324, 336 (4th Cir. 2009); Doe v. Salisbury Univ., 123 F. Supp. 3d 748, 758 n.5 (D. Md. \n2015).  \nPlaintiffs try to skirt the deficiency of their Amended Complaint by arguing that the \npractice at issue “is an application of the 2019 Redetermination Memorandum through a \nlitigation-inspired reinterpretation of the 2013 Kim Memo’s narrow affirmative-act exception.” \nECF No. 134 at 13 (emphasis in original). The Court is not convinced. Thus, this Court denies \nPlaintiffs’ Motion to Amend the Preliminary Injunction to the extent Plaintiffs request the Court \nto enjoin USCIS’s policy of denying jurisdiction over a child’s asylum application based on an \nalleged “affirmative act” involving a mere notation that the child has been reunited with a parent \nor legal guardian or has turned 18 years old. In anticipation of this result, Plaintiffs have \nrequested “leave to amend [their complaint] to remove any doubt that USCIS’s dramatic \n52 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 53 of 55\nexpansion of the ‘affirmative act’ exception from the 2013 Kim memo is at issue here, as it \neffectively seeks to implement the same policy as the 2019 Redetermination memorandum in an \nequally unlawful manner.” ECF No. 134 at 15. The Court grants this request and Plaintiffs may \nfile a second amended complaint within 14 days. \nC.  Joint Motion to Stay Summary Judgment Schedule \nPursuant to the Court’s June 29, 2020 scheduling order, summary judgment briefing was \nscheduled to begin on August 21, 2020 and to be completed on October 16, 2020. ECF No. 135. \nIn accordance with the June 29 scheduling order, Defendants produced the administrative record \non July 24, 2020. Id. After reviewing the produced record, Plaintiffs raised issues with \nDefendants regarding what Plaintiffs believe to be deficiencies with the administrative record as \nproduced. Id. The parties filed a Joint Motion to Stay Summary Judgment Schedule on August \n10, 2020, requesting the Court to stay briefing on the parties’ motions for summary judgment \npending resolution of the parties’ disputes regarding the contents of the administrative record. \nECF No. 135-1. Defendants filed an amended administrative record with the Court on October 2, \n2020. ECF No. 139 at 2. Plaintiffs, however, continue to believe that significant deficiencies \nremain. Id. The parties have not yet come to an agreement and believe that the Court’s \ninvolvement may be necessary. Id.  \nThe Court grants the parties’ Joint Motion to Summary Judgment Schedule pending the \nresolution of the parties’ disputes regarding the contents of the administrative record and \ninstructs the parties to contact chambers to schedule a status call. \nD.  Joint Motion for Entry of Parties’ Proposed Protective Order \nThe parties filed a Joint Motion for Entry of Parties’ Proposed Protective Order on \nAugust 25, 2020. ECF No. 136. Having considered the parties’ motion and the attached \n53 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 54 of 55\nProtective Order, the Court finds that the parties’ Proposed Protective Order, ECF No. 136-1, \ncomplies with the requirements of Loc. R. 104.13 (D. Md. 2018) and thus grants the parties’ \njoint motion and enters the parties’ Proposed Protective Order. \nIII.  CONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, this Court grants Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification and \nAppointment of Class Counsel, ECF No. 117 and certifies the following class: All individuals \nnationwide who prior to the effective date of a lawfully promulgated policy prospectively \naltering the policy set forth in the 2013 Kim Memorandum (1) were determined to be an \nUnaccompanied Alien Child; and (2) who filed an asylum application that was pending with the \nUnited States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”); and (3) on the date they filed \ntheir asylum application with USCIS, were 18 years of age or older, or had a parent or legal \nguardian in the United States who is available to provide care and physical custody; and (4) for \nwhom USCIS has not adjudicated the individual’s asylum application on the merits. Plaintiff \nJ.O.P., M.A.L.C., M.E.R.E., and E.D.G. are appointed as class representatives. \nAdditionally, this Court grants, in part, and denies, in part, Plaintiffs’ Motion to Amend \nthe Preliminary Injunction, ECF No. 124, and accordingly amends the previous preliminary \ninjunction, ECF No. 71, such that Defendants, during the pendency of this litigation and until \nfurther Order of this Court are: (1) enjoined and restrained from relying on the policies set forth \nin the 2019 Redetermination Memorandum as a basis to decline jurisdiction over asylum \napplications of individuals previously determined to be unaccompanied alien children (“UACs”), \nto subject an asylum applicant to the one-year time limit for filing described at 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1158(a)(2)(B), or for any other purpose; (2) enjoined and restrained from rejecting jurisdiction \nover any asylum application filed by Plaintiffs and members of the class whose applications \n54 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 143   Filed 12/21/20   Page 55 of 55\nwould have been accepted under the 2013 Kim Memorandum; (3) enjoined and restrained from \ndeferring to EOIR determinations in assessing jurisdiction over asylum applications filed by \nPlaintiffs and members of the proposed class; and (4) enjoined and restrained during the removal \nproceedings of any Plaintiff or member of the class (including EOIR proceedings before \nimmigration judges and members of the Board of Immigration appeals) from seeking denials of \ncontinuances or other postponements in order to await adjudication of an asylum application that \nhas been filed with USCIS, from seeking EOIR exercise of jurisdiction over any asylum claim \nwhere USCIS has initial jurisdiction under the terms of the 2013 Kim Memorandum, or from \notherwise taking a position in such individual’s removal proceedings that, inconsistent with the \n2013 Kim Memorandum, USCIS does not have initial jurisdiction over the individual’s asylum \napplication. Defendant USCIS will retract any adverse decision rendered on or after June 30, \n2019 that is based in whole or in part on any of the actions enjoined and restrained by (1), (2), or \n(3) above.  \nFinally, the Court grants parties’ Joint Motion to Stay Summary Judgment Schedule, ECF \nNo. 135, and grants parties’ Joint Motion for Entry of Parties’ Proposed Protective Order, ECF \nNo. 136.  \nA separate Order shall issue. \n \nDate: December   21, 2020                    ___/s/_______________________              \nGEORGE J.

Albence, in his official capacity as Acting Director of \nICE.  Plaintiffs allege as follows:   \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  Plaintiffs are among thousands of unaccompanied immigrant children who have \nmade the long and perilous journey to the United States to seek protection, fleeing violence and \npersecution in their countries of origin.  This class action challenges a federal agency’s sudden \nshift in policy that retroactively strips Plaintiffs of critical, statutory asylum protections. \n2.  Recognizing the vulnerability and special needs of unaccompanied immigrant \nchildren, Congress has enacted laws specifically designed to protect them.  In 2008, Congress \nenacted the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act \n(“TVPRA”).  The TVPRA provides multiple protections to unaccompanied immigrant children, \nwho are often vulnerable to trafficking, persecution, trauma, and other harms en route to or while \nin the United States.  \n3.  The TVPRA draws on a prior statutory definition according to which an \n“unaccompanied alien child” (“UAC”) is one whom the federal government determines to be \nwithout lawful immigration status, under the age of 18, and without a parent or legal guardian in \nthe United States available to provide care and physical custody.  6 U.S.C. § 279(g)(2).   \n4.  Defendant DHS apprehended each Plaintiff upon entering the United States and \ndetermined that each Plaintiff satisfied this definition.  At or about the same time, Defendant \nDHS prepared legal documents to initiate proceedings in a United States immigration court \npursuant to Section 240 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”) against each Plaintiff to \ndetermine whether each Plaintiff should be removed from the United States (“removal \nproceedings”).  Such removal proceedings are conducted by immigration judges within the \n2 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 91   Filed 12/20/19   Page 3 of 43\n \n \nExecutive Office for Immigration Review (“EOIR”), an agency of the U.S. Department of \nJustice. \n5.  The TVPRA relieves unaccompanied immigrant children of two procedural \nhurdles to accessing the asylum system, providing a more child-appropriate way for the \ngovernment to process their claims to protection under U.S. and international law fairly.   \n6.  First, the TVPRA creates an exception to the general requirement that asylum \napplicants facing removal proceedings present their asylum claims in an adversarial setting \nbefore the immigration court.  Instead, through a grant of initial jurisdiction over their asylum \nclaims to USCIS, the TVPRA allows unaccompanied immigrant children to pursue asylum in the \nfirst instance through a non-adversarial administrative interview with a trained asylum officer \nwithin USCIS, a process more appropriate for traumatized young applicants. \n7.  Second, the TVPRA exempts unaccompanied immigrant children from a one-year \nfiling deadline that otherwise applies to asylum applicants.  Without that TVPRA exemption, \nasylum applicants filing later than one year after entering the United States are ineligible for \nasylum unless they can establish that they merit an exception to the one-year filing deadline.  \n8.  Under a policy USCIS adopted effective June 2013 to implement these TVPRA \nasylum protections, Plaintiffs, and all other unaccompanied immigrant children seeking asylum \nin the United States, were entitled to access the TVPRA asylum process once they had been \ndetermined to be a UAC upon their initial apprehension by DHS, as long as that determination \nremained in place when the child initially applied for asylum.  Under this 2013 policy, USCIS \nexercised initial jurisdiction over an unaccompanied immigrant child’s asylum claim even if the \napplicant had turned 18 or had been reunited with a parent or appointed a legal guardian before \napplying for asylum. \n3 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 91   Filed 12/20/19   Page 4 of 43\n \n \n9.  This rule was subject to a limited exception where the UAC determination had \nbeen terminated before the child filed for asylum, by an intervening “affirmative act” of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), or by the DHS component agencies ICE or \nU.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”).   \n10.  Moreover, under the 2013 policy, USCIS exercised its initial jurisdiction  \nregardless of whether EOIR had made findings or determinations with respect to the statutory \nUAC definition or the merits of the asylum claim.  \n11.  In 2019, DHS unlawfully curtailed the permanent protections enacted by \nCongress in the TVPRA.  On June 14, 2019, Defendant USCIS posted a memorandum dated \nMay 31, 2019 (the “2019 Redetermination Memo”) to its website announcing significant \nchanges to USCIS’s implementation of the TVPRA, effective June 30, 2019.1   \n12.  USCIS did not publish the 2019 Redetermination Memo in the Federal Register, \nand the agency did not invite public comment on any of the new directives set forth in the \nmemorandum.   \n13.  The 2019 Redetermination Memo mandated that, beginning on June 30, 2019, an \nasylum officer must make an independent factual inquiry to redetermine whether an applicant \nmet the statutory definition of a UAC on their filing date—even if that filing date was years ago, \nwhen the prior policy was in effect.  Under the 2019 Redetermination Memo, if USCIS \ndetermined that the individual no longer satisfied the definition on the date the individual applied \nfor asylum, USCIS would decline jurisdiction over the asylum application.  Moreover, based on \n                                                 \n1 Ex. 1, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Updated Procedures for Asylum \nApplications Filed by Unaccompanied Alien Children (May 31, 2019), \nhttps://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/refugees-asylum/asylum/minor-children-applying-asylum-\nthemselves. \n4 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 91   Filed 12/20/19   Page 5 of 43\n \n \nthe same determination, USCIS was also directed to conclude that an applicant was not entitled \nto the related protection that exempts UACs from the one-year deadline for filing asylum \napplications.   \n14.  The 2019 Redetermination Memo also required that, if EOIR had explicitly \ndetermined that USCIS did not have jurisdiction over an asylum application because it was not \none filed by a UAC, the asylum officer would defer to that determination. \n15.  The  2019 Redetermination Memo thus called for USCIS to defer to intervening \ndeterminations by EOIR, abdicating USCIS’s initial jurisdiction over a UAC asylum claim if an \nimmigration court concluded, based on its own factual finding, that USCIS lacks jurisdiction \nover a child’s case.  In this way, the 2019 Redetermination Memo purported to authorize EOIR \nto preempt the statutory grant to USCIS of initial jurisdiction over an asylum application based \nsolely on EOIR’s own determination of jurisdictional factors and allow EOIR to adjudicate the \nmerits of an asylum claim  simply by reaching it more quickly than USCIS.  The policy thus \nundermined the core purpose of the TVPRA to provide procedural protections to vulnerable \nchildren seeking asylum.   \n16.  By its terms, the 2019 Redetermination Memo applied to any USCIS decision \nissued on or after its effective date of June 30, 2019.  Thus, the policy was to be implemented \nretroactively—applying to individuals who already had asylum applications pending before \nUSCIS, even those whom USCIS already interviewed as of June 30, 2019, as well as to others \nwho have relied upon USCIS’s 2013 policy.    \n17.  The 2019 Redetermination Memo marked a drastic change in USCIS policy and a \ndeparture from the protections in the TVPRA that profoundly undermines Plaintiffs’ rights, and \nthe rights of other unaccompanied immigrant children who have filed for or plan to file for \n5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 91   Filed 12/20/19   Page 6 of 43\n \n \nasylum in the United States.  Under the policy in place since 2013, Plaintiffs were entitled to \nseek asylum before USCIS, regardless of any EOIR determination to the contrary, and were \nrelieved from the requirement to show that they either had filed within one year or qualified for \nan exception to that general deadline.  Under the 2019 Redetermination Memo, they will be \ndeprived of their right to seek asylum before USCIS, and they will face an adversarial process in \nwhich an ICE prosecutor subjects them to cross examination and advocates for their deportation.  \nFurther, Plaintiffs may lose their eligibility to seek asylum entirely by retroactive imposition of a \nfiling deadline that was inapplicable to their applications at the time they were filed. \n18.  The 2019 policy, in calling for USCIS to defer to EOIR’s jurisdictional \ndeterminations, results in EOIR taking action on a case where USCIS holds initial jurisdiction. \nDefendants have acted to ensure precisely this result:  ICE, in its role as prosecutor in \nimmigration court, frequently advocates for EOIR to assert and/or exercise its jurisdiction in \nthese cases so as to deprive USCIS of the opportunity to exercise initial jurisdiction.  \n19.  Following the filing of the initial Complaint in this action on July 1, 2019 and in \nresponse to Plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) filed the same day, \nDefendants conceded during the July 19, 2019 hearing in this litigation that the policy set forth in \nthe 2019 Redetermination Memo was unconstitutionally retroactive, offering entry of an order \nthat would “take the retroactivity part of the case off the table.”  7/19/19 Hearing Tr. at p. 6. \n20.  The Court recognized Plaintiffs’ likelihood of success on the merits of both the \nretroactivity and procedural claims, and entered a TRO on August 2, 2019 (extended multiple \ntimes) and then, on Plaintiffs’ unopposed motion, a preliminary injunction (“PI”) on October 15, \n2019, all requiring Defendants to continue to adjudicate UAC asylum cases pursuant to the 2013 \npolicy.   \n6 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 91   Filed 12/20/19   Page 7 of 43\n \n \n21.  Despite the Court’s TRO and PI, Defendants continued to attempt to displace \nUSCIS’s statutory initial jurisdiction over UAC asylum claims with determinations by the \nimmigration courts.   \n22.  On information and belief, Defendant ICE has a policy or practice of advocating \nfor immigration judges to conclude, contrary to the 2013 policy and despite the TRO and the PI, \nthat applicants who have turned 18 or reunited with a parent before applying for asylum are not \nwithin USCIS’s jurisdiction.  In so doing, ICE furthers USCIS’s unlawful abdication of \njurisdiction over those cases. \n23.   In making these significant and harmful policy changes that undermine the \npurpose of and are inconsistent with the TVPRA, without providing notice or opportunity to \ncomment, and by announcing their intent to apply the new policy retroactively, Defendants have \nviolated the TVPRA itself, the Administrative Procedures Act (“APA”), and the constitutional \ndue process rights of children who seek to access the statutory asylum system in the United \nStates. \n24.  Plaintiffs seek the Court’s intervention so that they and others similarly situated \nmay exercise their right to seek asylum before USCIS and maintain their statutory exemption \nfrom the general one-year filing deadline.  Defendants’ actions have caused and, unless fully \nenjoined, will continue to cause serious and irreparable harm to Plaintiffs and to the proposed \nclass.  Plaintiffs therefore seek declaratory and injunctive relief from this Court to end these \nviolations and harms.  \n \nPLAINTIFFS \n25.  Plaintiff J.O.P. is an 18-year-old from Guatemala, who currently resides with his \nmother at  , College Park, Maryland (located in Prince George’s County).   \n7 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 91   Filed 12/20/19   Page 8 of 43\n \n \n26.

J.O.P. is currently in removal proceedings under 8 U.S.C. § 1229a, INA § 240.  \n28.  On or about November 25, 2015, agents for Defendant Department of Homeland \nSecurity determined that J.O.P. is a UAC.  \n29.  J.O.P. subsequently was reunified with his mother. \n30.  On February 20, 2018, J.O.P. filed his asylum application with USCIS, exercising \nhis right to seek asylum before USCIS based on the policy that has been in place since 2013.  He \nhas yet to obtain an interview from USCIS for his asylum application. \n31.  Plaintiff M.A.L.C. is a 21-year-old from Guatemala, who currently resides at \n, Los Angeles, California.   \n32.  M.A.L.C.’s parents were murdered in Guatemala, and thereafter, he continued to \nexperience repeated threats of violence and extortion in Guatemala.  M.A.L.C. fled to the United \nStates in August 2016. \n33.  M.A.L.C. is currently in removal proceedings under 8 U.S.C. § 1229a, INA § 240. \n34.  In August 2016, agents for Defendant Department of Homeland Security \ndetermined that M.A.L.C. is a UAC.   \n35.  On February 14, 2018, when he was 19 years old, M.A.L.C. filed his asylum \napplication with USCIS, exercising his right to seek asylum before USCIS based on the policy in \nplace since June 2013.  M.A.L.C. has yet to be interviewed by USCIS on his asylum application.   \n36.

On March 30, 2018, when he was 18 years old, M.E.R.E. filed his asylum \napplication with USCIS, exercising his right to seek asylum before USCIS based on the policy \nthat has been in place since 2013.  USCIS has not yet scheduled M.E.R.E. for an asylum \ninterview. \n42.  Plaintiff K.A.R.C. is a 20-year-old from El Salvador, who currently resides at   \nd, Gaithersburg, Maryland (located in Montgomery County).  \n43.  K.A.R.C. fled El Salvador because of abuse, discrimination, and persecution that \nhe experienced based on his perceived sexual orientation. \n44.  K.A.R.C. is currently in removal proceedings under 8 U.S.C. § 1229a, INA § 240. \n45.  Around May 2016, agents for Defendant Department of Homeland Security \ndetermined that K.A.R.C. is a UAC.   \n46.  In the fall of 2017, when K.A.R.C. was 18 years old, he filed his asylum \napplication with USCIS, exercising his right to seek asylum before USCIS based on the policy in \nplace since June 2013.  In November 2017, USCIS conducted the asylum interview with \nK.A.R.C.  USCIS has not yet issued a decision in K.A.R.C.’s case. \n47.  Plaintiff E.D.G. is a 20-year-old from Honduras, who current resides at   \n, Kansas City, Missouri. \n9 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 91   Filed 12/20/19   Page 10 of 43\n \n \n48.  E.D.G. fled Honduras after years of being sexually, physically, and emotionally \nabused—as well as being targeted by a gang for recruitment and being grievously harmed by that \ngang for refusing to join. \n49.  On or about July 4, 2016, agents for Defendant Department of Homeland Security \ndetermined that E.D.G. is a UAC.   \n50.  E.D.G. was placed into removal proceedings under 8 U.S.C. § 1229a, INA § 240 \non July 5, 2016. \n51.  In late 2017, when E.D.G. was 18 years old, he filed his asylum application with \nUSCIS, exercising his right to seek asylum before USCIS based on the policy in place since June \n2013.  On March 6, 2018, USCIS conducted the asylum interview with E.D.G. \n52.  Before USCIS issued a decision on E.D.G.’s asylum claim, an immigration judge \nordered E.D.G. removed on October 10, 2018, after concluding that it had jurisdiction over \nE.D.G.’s asylum application and denying it on the merits. E.D.G.’s removal order is on appeal \nbefore the Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”).  \n53.  On July 25, 2019, USCIS rejected jurisdiction over E.D.G.’s asylum application \nunder the 2019 Redetermination Memo because he had not established that he was under 18 \nyears old at the time he filed it.  On August 5, 2019, USCIS reopened E.D.G.’s case in \ncompliance with this Court’s TRO. \n54.  On September 30, 2019, while the Court’s TRO remained in effect, USCIS again \nrejected jurisdiction over E.D.G.’s asylum application relying on the 2019 Redetermination \nMemo.  USCIS issued a Notice of Lack of Jurisdiction on grounds that the “Immigration Judge \nmade an affirmative act to terminate UAC status on October 10, 2018.” \n10 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 91   Filed 12/20/19   Page 11 of 43\n \n \n55.  On November 22, 2019, Plaintiffs’ counsel filed a motion to enforce the \npreliminary injunction now in effect, seeking an order requiring Defendants to retract USCIS’s \nSeptember 30, 2019 jurisdictional rejection in E.D.G.’s case and to adjudicate his case under the \n2013 policy.   \nDEFENDANTS \n56.  Defendant U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) is a federal cabinet \ndepartment responsible for implementing and enforcing the Immigration and Nationality Act \n(“INA”) (see 8 U.S.C. § 1103) and an “agency” within the meaning of the APA (5 U.S.C. \n§ 551(1)). \n57.  Defendant Chad Wolf is the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security and therefore \nthe “head” of the Department of Homeland Security.  6 U.S.C. § 112(a)(2).  He is charged with \nadministering and enforcing the federal immigration and nationality laws.  8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(1), \n(3).  He is sued in his official capacity. \n58.  Defendant U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) is a bureau \nwithin DHS (6 U.S.C. § 271) and an “agency” within the meaning of the APA (5 U.S.C. \n§ 551(1)).  USCIS is the “agency” that issued the 2019 Redetermination Memo. \n59.  Defendant Kenneth T. Cuccinelli is the Acting Director of U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services and therefore the “head” of that agency (6 U.S.C. §§ 113(a)(1)(E) & \n271(a)(2)).  He is sued in his official capacity. \n60.  Defendant U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) is a bureau \nwithin DHS (6 U.S.C. § 252) and an “agency” within the meaning of the APA (5 U.S.C. \n§ 551(1)).  ICE attorneys act as prosecutors before the immigration courts, advocating for the \ngovernment’s position with respect to, inter alia, an immigration judge’s jurisdiction, the \nremovability of respondents in removal proceedings, and whether a continuance or other \n11 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 91   Filed 12/20/19   Page 12 of 43\n \n \npostponement of the immigration court case is warranted to allow USCIS to adjudicate an \napplication pending before that agency.  6 U.S.C. § 252(c).2  \n61.  Defendant Matthew T. Albence is the Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement and is therefore the “head” of that agency (6 U.S.C. §§ 113(a)(1)(G) \n& 252(a)(2)).  He is sued in his official capacity. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n62.  This Court has federal question jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ complaint under 28 \nU.S.C. § 1331.  It has the authority to issue declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 2201, 2202; 5 U.S.C. §§ 705, 706(1), 706(2)(A)-(D); and its general equitable powers. \n63.  The APA provides a cause of action for parties adversely affected by final agency \naction when “there is no other adequate remedy in a court.”  5 U.S.C. § 704.  That condition is \nmet in this case because the 2019 Redetermination Memo is a “final agency action” within the \nmeaning of the statute, as is the declining or preemption of USCIS’s initial jurisdiction over \nasylum in a particular UAC’s case, and there is no other adequate remedy available in any other \ncourt. \n64.  Venue is proper in this district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1) because Defendants \nare officers or agencies of the United States and one or more Plaintiffs reside in the district \nwithin the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 1391(d). \n65.  This case is properly assigned to the Southern Division of the District of \nMaryland because the majority of Plaintiffs reside in that Division.  See Local Rule 501. \n                                                 \n2 Defendants ICE and Mr. Albence are added in this First Amended Complaint for clarity of \npleading and in an abundance of caution, in light of the additional allegations regarding ICE’s \nrole in furthering the unlawful policy of the 2019 Redetermination Memo.  Because ICE is an \ninstrumentality of original Defendant DHS, under the control and acting at the direction of \noriginal Defendant Acting Secretary of DHS, it would be bound by this Court’s interim orders \nand final judgment whether or not it and its acting director were separately named. \n12 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 91   Filed 12/20/19   Page 13 of 43\n \n \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nPassage of the TVPRA in 2008 \n66.  Before 2002, the care and placement of unaccompanied immigrant children in the \nUnited States was the responsibility of the Office of Juvenile Affairs in the former Immigration \nand Naturalization Service (“INS”).  In 2002, Congress enacted the Homeland Security Act \n(“HSA”).  Pub. L. No. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2153.  The HSA created DHS and transferred most \nimmigration functions formerly performed by INS to the newly formed DHS and its components, \nincluding USCIS, CBP, and ICE.  \n67.  The HSA defined an “unaccompanied alien child” as a child who: “(A) has no \nlawful immigration status in the United States; (B) has not attained 18 years of age; and (C) with \nrespect to whom—(i) there is no parent or legal guardian in the United States; or (ii) no parent or \nlegal guardian in the United States is available to provide care and physical custody.”  HSA \n462(g)(2); 6 U.S.C. § 279(g)(2).  Congress transferred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement \n(“ORR”), within HHS, the responsibility for the care of UACs “who are in Federal custody by \nreason of their immigration status.”  HSA 462(a), (b)(1)(A); 6 U.S.C. § 279(a), (b)(1)(A).  \n68.  Six years later, Congress passed the TVPRA, which was signed into law on \nDecember 23, 2008 and took effect in March 2009.  In addition to measures to combat \ninternational and domestic human trafficking, including trafficking of children, the TVPRA   \nrecognized the vulnerability of children fleeing their countries of origin to seek protection in the \nUnited States, and responded with multiple provisions addressing safe custody and child-\nappropriate procedures for unaccompanied immigrant children.   \n69.  In structuring the TVPRA, Congress placed legal protections for UACs, including \nprovisions on asylum, in a section of the statute titled “Permanent protection for certain at-risk \nchildren.”  TVPRA § 235(d); see 8 U.S.C. § 1232(d).  \n13 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 91   Filed 12/20/19   Page 14 of 43\n \n \n70.  Among other safeguards, the TVPRA provides that USCIS has “initial \njurisdiction” over a UAC’s asylum application, even where the UAC is in removal \nproceedings—a deviation from the ordinary rule that “affirmative” asylum before USCIS is only \navailable to those who are not in removal proceedings.  TVPRA § 235(d)(7); 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1158(b)(3)(C).  Conferring initial jurisdiction on USCIS instead of an immigration judge \nprovides a non-adversarial system more sensitive to the special needs of child immigrants who \nlack understanding of how to navigate an immigration system designed for adults.  Instead of \nhaving to be cross-examined in an adversarial courtroom by trained government lawyers \n(without the right to appointed counsel), a UAC applicant is seen by USCIS asylum officers \ntrained to conduct non-adversarial interviews and apply child-sensitive and trauma-informed \ninterview techniques.   \n71.  Generally, asylum applicants must file their asylum application within one year \nafter entering the United States unless they can prove that they fall within one of two limited \nexceptions.  8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B).  Recognizing that children were forced to struggle \nthrough a system designed for adults, even though they lack the capacity to understand nuanced \nlegal principles, let alone courtroom and administrative procedures, the second TVPRA \nprotection at issue here makes the one-year filing deadline inapplicable to UACs.  TVPRA \n§ 235(d)(7); 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(E).  Accordingly, a UAC who was unable to file within one \nyear will not be required to demonstrate changed or extraordinary circumstances relating to the \ndelay in filing the application, and that the application was nonetheless filed in a reasonable time.  \nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(D); 8 C.F.R. § 208.4(a)(5).   \n72.  The TVPRA also requires that federal officials who discover a UAC must transfer \nthe UAC to the custody of HHS within a 72-hour period (absent exceptional circumstances), for \n14 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 91   Filed 12/20/19   Page 15 of 43\n \n \ncare and custody.  TVPRA § 235(b)(3); 8 U.S.C. § 1232(b)(3).  This requirement places UACs \nunder the care of an agency set up to provide for their safety and welfare, rather than an agency \nwhose mission is to enforce immigration laws.  For example, HHS contracts with agencies who \nhave social workers on staff who are trained to work with children.  \n73.  Nothing in the TVPRA directs or authorizes any government agency to rescind a \ndetermination that a child is a UAC, or to abrogate the asylum procedures that apply to a child \ndetermined to be a UAC.  \n74.  In the words of Senator Dianne Feinstein, a co-author of the TVPRA provisions, \ntheir purpose was “to ensure that unaccompanied children receive humane and appropriate \ntreatment while in the custody of the U.S. Government”3 and to “give unaccompanied minors \naccess to pro bono legal counsel and someone to look after their best interest.”  154 Cong. Rec. \nS10886 (daily ed. Dec. 10, 2008).  Senator Feinstein explained that: \nI believe we have a special obligation to ensure that these children are treated \nhumanely and fairly.  Unfortunately, without this legislation, there would be no \nprocedure to make sure that happens.  Currently, when a child is apprehended by \nimmigration authorities, that child usually knows nothing about U.S. courts or \nimmigration policies and frequently does not speak English.   \n \nId. \n75.  Congress instructed USCIS, in order to properly administer the TVPRA, to enact \n“regulations which take into account the specialized needs of unaccompanied alien children and \nwhich address both procedural and substantive aspects of handling unaccompanied alien \nchildren’s cases.”  TVPRA § 235(d)(8); 8 U.S.C. § 1232(d)(8).  USCIS has failed to enact any \nsuch regulations in the ten years since Congress passed the TVPRA.  \n                                                 \n3 July 31, 2008 Press Release, available at \nhttps://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=7b292e44-b306-86d0-\na0b4-981389abaf5d. \n15 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 91   Filed 12/20/19   Page 16 of 43\n \n \n \nInitial Implementation of the TVPRA and the September 2012 Office of the Citizenship \nand Immigration Services Ombudsman’s Report  \n \n76.  In 2009, USCIS issued a memorandum instructing asylum officers on the rules to \nfollow for evaluation of asylum applications filed by UACs in removal proceedings.  Ex. 2 \n(March 25, 2009 Memorandum re: Implementation of Statutory Change Providing USCIS with \nInitial Jurisdiction over Asylum Applications Filed by Unaccompanied Alien Children).  The \nmemorandum instructs asylum officers that they must make an initial determination as to \nUSCIS’s jurisdiction for all asylum applications filed by UACs in removal proceedings.  Id. at 4.  \nFurther, according to the 2009 memorandum, asylum officers are to determine whether, at the \ntime of filing, the child was under 18 years of age and unaccompanied.  Id. at 4-5.  The 2009 \nmemorandum states that “[f]ederal regulations will ultimately be promulgated in order to reflect \nthe procedures established for USCIS initial jurisdiction.”  Id. at 1. \n77.  The procedures set forth in the 2009 memorandum were contrary to the TVPRA, \nas acknowledged by the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman (“Ombudsman”).4  \nOn September 20, 2012, the Ombudsman issued a report, titled Ensuring a Fair and Efficient \nAsylum Process for Unaccompanied Minor Children (the “2012 Ombudsman Report”) (Ex. 3), \nproviding an independent analysis of problems encountered by UACs seeking asylum in the \nUnited States, and recommendations to improve the process.  The Ombudsman recognized that \nUSCIS had failed to implement the “statutorily required regulations” for UACs seeking asylum.  \n                                                 \n4 The Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, established by the Homeland Security \nAct of 2002, provides independent analysis of problems encountered by individuals interacting \nwith U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and proposes changes to mitigate those \nproblems.  See 6 U.S.C. § 272. \n16 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 91   Filed 12/20/19   Page 17 of 43\n \n \nInstead, USCIS had “developed and implemented certain temporary policies and procedures for \nUAC asylum-seekers.”  Id. at 3. \n78.  To complete its review, the Ombudsman “interviewed USCIS Asylum Division \nmanager and staff at Headquarters and seven of the eight Asylum Offices, EOIR officials, and \nstakeholders throughout the country.”  Ex. 3 at 2.  The Ombudsman “also studied case assistance \nrequests and reported incidents submitted directly to [its] office by stakeholders.”  Id.  \n79.  According to the Ombudsman, “Congress did not provide language indicating that \nthe filing of an asylum application should trigger a new or successive UAC determinations that \ncould eliminate statutory protections or remove the UAC from [removal] proceedings.”  Id. at 5.  \n80.  The Ombudsman also recognized that the “TVPRA’s procedural and substantive \nprotections were designed to remain available to UACs throughout removal proceedings, \nhousing placement, and the pursuit of any available relief.  Subjecting a child seeking asylum to \nmultiple UAC determinations as is required by USCIS’ temporary guidance appears at odds with \nthe TVPRA’s express purpose, namely, to provide timely, appropriate relief for vulnerable \nchildren.”  Id.   \n81.  The Ombudsman recognized that, when a child is placed in removal proceedings, \nthe apprehending entity, whether ICE or CBP, “must make a finding that the child is \nunaccompanied.”  Id. at 5.  However, in the period between enactment of the TVPRA and \npromulgation of the 2013 policy, USCIS routinely revisited determinations that a child was a \nUAC, inquiring into whether the applicant was a UAC at the date of filing an asylum application \nand at the date of the asylum interview.  Id. at 3-4.  Based on such redeterminations, USCIS \ndeclined to exercise its initial jurisdiction over some children who had filed applications with \nUSCIS pursuant to the TVPRA provisions.  Id. at 6. \n17 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 91   Filed 12/20/19   Page 18 of 43\n \n \n82.  In the 2012 Ombudsman Report, the Ombudsman outlined numerous problems \nthat flowed from redetermining UAC status at asylum interviews, including inefficiencies \nattendant upon scheduling and conducting interviews only to disclaim jurisdiction in nearly half \nthe cases (id. at  6); officers assessing complex parent-child relationships without specialized \ntraining (id. at 7); and undermining predictability and uniformity in the handling of children’s \ncases (id. at 6).  The Ombudsman explained that instead of “facilitating expedited, non-\nadversarial interviews envisioned by Congress,” the USCIS policy of undertaking a \nredetermination of UAC status at every asylum interview created “delay and confusion.”  Id. at \n4. \n83.  Recognizing the deficiencies in this process, the Ombudsman made a number of \nrecommendations “[t]o address confusion related to UAC redeterminations, facilitate improved \ninterview techniques and adjudications, and reduce post-interview processing delays.”  Id. at 1-2.  \nAs the Ombudsman noted:  \nA child’s living circumstances or relationship with his or her family may be \ndynamic, so the child may fall both within and without of the UAC definition \nwhile present in the United States.  Given this fluidity, as well as inconsistencies \nin practice by DHS and EOIR, legal advocates believe that the UAC definition \nitself is too vague and impractical, and that the status, once attached, should \nremain with a child through the pendency of his or her case. \n \nId. at 4.5 \n \n84.  The Ombudsman recommended that USCIS accept jurisdiction of an asylum \napplication filed by a child whom a federal agency had previously determined to be a UAC.  Id. \nat 4-5. \n                                                 \n5 The Ombudsman’s report quotes an article from the American Immigration Lawyers \nAssociation, Immigration Practice Pointers 2011- 2012 Edition, “The ABCs of Representing \nUnaccompanied Children,” (June 2011) at p. 588.   \n18 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 91   Filed 12/20/19   Page 19 of 43\n \n \n85.  As the Ombudsman correctly concluded based on its extensive assessment, \n“[e]liminating the practice of USCIS redetermining UAC status during the asylum interview \nwould also restore a level of fairness that comes from having a predictable and uniform process.”  \nId. at 6.  According to the Ombudsman, the practice of “adopt[ing a] UAC determination made \nfor custody purposes by CBP and ICE . . . will positively affect all minors apprehended and \nplaced into federal custody with the HHS, helping to ensure a consistent process for scores of \nchildren who seek asylum in the United States.”6  \nUSCIS Response to the Ombudsman’s Report and the 2013 Kim Memorandum \n86.  On April 11, 2013, USCIS responded to the Ombudsman’s Report, thanking the \nOmbudsman “for the opportunity to respond to [the Ombudsman’s recommendation] to ensure a \nfair and effective asylum process.”  Ex. 7 at 1.  USCIS recognized that “there is room to \nimprove,” and agreed with the Ombudsman’s recommendation that USCIS should accept \njurisdiction of asylum applications filed by children DHS previously determined to be UACs.  Id. \nat 2-3. \n87.  On May 28, 2013, USCIS issued a memorandum authored by Ted Kim, Acting \nChief, Asylum Division, regarding “Updated Procedures for Determination of Initial \nJurisdiction over Asylum Applications Filed by Unaccompanied Alien Children” (the “2013 Kim \nMemorandum”) (Ex. 4).  The 2013 Kim Memorandum provides procedures for “determining \njurisdiction in applications for asylum filed by unaccompanied alien children (UACs) under the \ninitial jurisdiction provision of the [TVPRA].”  Ex. 4 at 1.   \n                                                 \n6 Ex. 5, Annual Report 2013, Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman (June 27, \n2013). \n19 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 91   Filed 12/20/19   Page 20 of 43\n \n \n88.  The 2013 Kim Memorandum implemented the Ombudsman’s recommendation \nthat USCIS accept jurisdiction of the asylum applications of those children whom a federal \nagency had already determined met the statutory definition of a UAC.  Id. at 2.  Under the 2013 \nKim Memorandum, “[i]n cases in which CBP or ICE has already determined that the applicant is \na UAC, Asylum Offices will adopt that determination and take jurisdiction over the case.”  Id.  \nFurther, if as of the date of initial filing of the asylum application, that UAC status determination \nwas still in place—not having been terminated by an “affirmative act” of HHS, ICE, or CBP—\n“USCIS will take initial jurisdiction over the case, even if there appears to be evidence that the \napplicant may have turned 18 years of age or may have reunited with a parent or legal guardian \nsince the CBP or ICE determination.”  Id.  \n89.   The 2013 Kim Memorandum does not refer to EOIR as an agency whose \ndetermination would be binding upon USCIS or even relevant to USCIS’s jurisdictional \ndetermination. \n90.  Under the 2013 Kim Memorandum, USCIS is not permitted to defer to an EOIR’s \njurisdiction determination. \n91.  While the 2013 Kim Memorandum was in effect, USCIS asylum officers were not \ninstructed that immigration judges had the authority to make any determinations about UAC \nstatus or to terminate UAC findings. \n92.  Just weeks before issuing the 2019 Redetermination Memo, on May 20, 2019, \nUSCIS confirmed to public stakeholders that the asylum policy and procedures set forth in the \n2013 Kim Memorandum remained in effect.  Ex. 6 (USCIS Asylum Division Quarterly Meeting \nAgenda, May 20, 2019) at 3.  This was the most recent reaffirmation in a series of public \nstatements to stakeholders in which USCIS confirmed that “[t]he May 28, 2013 Memorandum on \n20 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 91   Filed 12/20/19   Page 21 of 43\n \n \ninitial jurisdiction over asylum applications filed by UACs and the related June 2013 policy \ndocuments remain in effect.”  Id.  \n93.  In reliance on the rules set forth in the 2013 Kim Memorandum, Plaintiffs and \nother unaccompanied immigrant children similarly situated, filed asylum applications with \nUSCIS prior to June 30, 2019.  In anticipation of this Court’s order of injunctive relief, or \npursuant to this Court’s TRO and PI, additional unaccompanied immigrant children amenable to \nUSCIS jurisdiction under the 2013 Kim Memorandum filed asylum applications with USCIS on \nor after June 30, 2019.     \nThe 2019 Redetermination Memo Issued by USCIS \n \n94.  On June 14, 2019, USCIS published a memorandum on its website that drastically \nchanged the rules for determining whether a child is eligible to seek asylum before USCIS.  The \n2019 Redetermination Memo, dated May 31, 2019, is authored by John Lafferty (Chief, Asylum \nDivision) and titled “Updated Procedures for Asylum Applications Filed by Unaccompanied \nAlien Children” (Ex. 1).  Although the memorandum is dated May 31, 2019, USCIS did not \npublish this memorandum on its website until June 14, 2019. \n95.  The 2019 Redetermination Memo acknowledges that the asylum policy in place \nsince 2013 allowed “asylum officers to adopt prior UAC determinations made by U.S. Customs \nand Border Protection (CBP) or U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) without \nfurther factual inquiry, so long as those determinations were still in place on the date of filing the \nasylum application.”  Ex. 1 at 2. \n96.  Reversing the 2013 policy, the 2019 Redetermination Memo directed that all \nasylum officers must “mak[e] independent factual inquiries in all cases in order to determine \nwhether the individual met the UAC definition on the date of first filing the asylum application”  \n21 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 91   Filed 12/20/19   Page 22 of 43\n \n \nwhich in turn determines whether USCIS will exercise jurisdiction, and “examine whether the \nindividual was a UAC at the time of first filing for the purposes of determining whether the one-\nyear filing deadline applies.”  Id.  The 2019 Redetermination Memo also instructs that if EOIR \nhas explicitly determined that USCIS does not have jurisdiction over an asylum application \nbecause it is not one filed by a UAC, the asylum officer is to defer to that determination.  Id. at 4 \nn.5. \n97.  Under the policy set forth in the 2019 Redetermination Memo, an individual who \nwas previously determined to be a UAC and who applied for asylum with USCIS after turning \n18 or reunifying with a parent or legal guardian relying on existing USCIS policy would have \ntheir asylum application rejected by USCIS for lack of jurisdiction.  The same is true if EOIR \nhad determined that USCIS lacked jurisdiction over the asylum application because it was not \nfiled by a UAC.  That individual could also lose eligibility for asylum in any forum due to the \nretroactive application of the one-year bar on filing. \n98.  The 2019 Redetermination Memo states that its “updated procedures” “apply to \nany USCIS decision issued on or after the effective date” of the memorandum (emphasis in \noriginal).  Id. at 1.  The 2019 Redetermination Memo is dated May 31, 2019 and purported to \ntake effect on June 30, 2019, which is 30 calendar days from the date of the memorandum. \n99.  Under the 2019 Redetermination Memo, an individual who was previously \ndetermined to be a UAC, and who applied for asylum relying on the procedures set forth in the \n2013 Kim Memorandum, could arrive at an asylum interview to find that USCIS would decline \njurisdiction because the asylum officer determined, based on an independent decision or in \ndeference to an EOIR pronouncement, that the applicant was not a UAC at the time of \napplication.  Indeed, the 2019 Redetermination Memo called for the same retroactive \n22 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 91   Filed 12/20/19   Page 23 of 43\n \n \njurisdictional denial in cases interviewed years ago and still awaiting decision when the 2019 \nRedetermination Memo took effect.  In those and other postures, if an asylum officer determines \nthat, at the time the application was filed, the child was over 18 or had a parent or legal guardian \nin the United States who the asylum officer determines was “available to provide care and \nphysical custody,” or if the asylum officer is aware of an EOIR determination to that effect, then \nthe asylum officer had to decline jurisdiction.  For those unaccompanied immigrant children in \nremoval proceedings who applied for asylum when they were 18 or older or after joining a parent \nor guardian, USCIS will, based on its redetermination, refer the children’s asylum claims to the \nimmigration court where they will await an adversarial process.  Moreover, as the CIS \nOmbudsman noted with reference to the initial 2009 policy, any record made in the USCIS \ninterview is then transmitted to ICE, allowing an ICE attorney to use it to cross-examine the \napplicant in the adversarial immigration court process.  The UAC applicant has no opportunity to \nchallenge those USCIS notes, taken in the course of a process USCIS now claims not to have \njurisdiction to conduct. \n100.  There are many reasons an unaccompanied child may have filed for asylum after \none year, after turning 18, or after a parent or legal guardian in the United States became able to \ntake custody of the child.  \n101.  As Congress recognized in passing the TVPRA, unaccompanied immigrant \nchildren are particularly unable to access complex immigration systems without the aid of a legal \nrepresentative, and it could take a child a substantial period of time to find legal representation—\nif she ever does.  The TVPRA’s procedural protections allow a child additional time to find legal \nrepresentation and access the asylum process.  Many unaccompanied immigrant children, \n23 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 91   Filed 12/20/19   Page 24 of 43\n \n \nincluding one or more of Plaintiffs, find legal representation after turning 18 or more than one \nyear after entry, and subsequently file for asylum before USCIS.  \n102.  Other children may find legal representation, but then pursue a form of \nimmigration relief or protection other than asylum first, knowing that that the TVPRA asylum \nprocess remains available.  For example, many unaccompanied immigrant children suffered \nneglect, abandonment, or abuse by a parent that qualifies them for special immigrant juvenile \nstatus (“SIJS”) under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(27)(J)—a form of protection that was substantially \nbroadened by the TVPRA—or qualify for forms of relief such as T and U visas for victims of \ntrafficking and other crimes.  For many reasons, including speed of processing, ability to avoid \nrevisiting trauma, and availability of visas, a UAC and his or her legal representative may decide \nto pursue SIJS or another form of potential relief prior to filing for asylum before USCIS.  \n103.  In applying for one of these other forms of relief since 2013, a child applicant \ncould rely on the opportunity to later file for asylum before USCIS, exempt from the one-year \nfiling deadline, and still be entitled to the child-appropriate non-adversarial interview process in \nthe first instance.  Then, under the system Congress created, if the child were unsuccessful in the \nUSCIS process, she would have the case referred back to immigration court, where she could \nagain present her asylum evidence to the immigration judge in an adversarial procedure.  \n104.  USCIS has during a period of many months delayed scheduling asylum \ninterviews for unaccompanied child applicants, preventing them from securing relief under the \nestablished policy.  Upon information and belief, USCIS delayed scheduling interviews in \nanticipation of the pronouncement of a new policy.  Further, USCIS may have delayed \ninterviews and adjudications in anticipation of an effective date such as that of the 2019 \n24 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 91   Filed 12/20/19   Page 25 of 43\n \n \nRedetermination Memo, with the effect of applying the policy retroactively to bar otherwise \nqualified children from benefitting from the protections of the TVPRA. \n105.  USCIS asserted in the 2019 Redetermination Memo that USCIS adopted the new \nasylum policy in order to bring USCIS practice in line with a precedential Board of Immigration \nAppeals (“BIA”) decision regarding jurisdiction over asylum applications.  According to USCIS, \nthe 2019 Redetermination Memo was necessary “[t]o ensure USCIS is making these \njurisdictional determinations in a manner consistent with Immigration Judge determinations on \nthe same issue.”  Ex. 1 at 2. \n106.  The BIA decision referenced in the 2019 Redetermination Memo, Matter of M-A-\nC-O-, 27 I. & N. Dec. 477 (BIA 2018), does not divest USCIS of its authority to determine \nwhether it has jurisdiction over an asylum application.  Indeed, USCIS recognized this in the \n2019 Redetermination Memo, stating “both the Immigration Judge and USCIS have authority to \nmake this jurisdictional determination.”  Ex. 1 at 2.  USCIS also recognized in its May 20, 2019 \nreport that the Matter of M-A-C-O- decision “does not address USCIS determinations about its \nown jurisdiction.  USCIS continues to make its jurisdictional determinations under its own \nprocedures.”  Ex. 6 at 3.  However, the 2019 Redetermination Memo does state that if EOIR has \nexplicitly determined that USCIS does not have jurisdiction over an asylum application because \nit is not one filed by a UAC, the asylum officer will defer to that determination.  Ex. 1 at 4 n.5. \n107.  The BIA decision does not mandate any changes to USCIS policy.  It does not \ninvalidate the asylum policy set forth in the 2013 Kim Memorandum or direct USCIS to \nimplement new procedures.   \n108.  Nonetheless, through ICE’s advocacy before the immigration courts, Defendants \nhave implemented a policy that abdicates USCIS’s statutorily mandated role of determining and \n25 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 91   Filed 12/20/19   Page 26 of 43\n \n \ntaking initial jurisdiction and instead permits EOIR to determine such cases on the merits despite \ninitial jurisdiction lying with USCIS, thus denying UAC applicants the initial non-adversarial \nhearing to which the TVPRA entitles them.  In the absence of affirmative steps by USCIS to give \neffect to its initial jurisdiction, and/or due to substantial delays in USCIS’s processing of these \ncases, ICE is regularly in a position to advocate that an immigration court act on a case \nnotwithstanding a pending UAC asylum claim before USCIS.  By affirmatively arguing that \nEOIR has jurisdiction and by opposing requests by applicants that EOIR stay its hand, ICE \nfacilitates USCIS’s abdication of its exercise of initial jurisdiction. \n109.  Neither the BIA decision nor the 2019 Redetermination Memo undertake any \nexamination of the reasons USCIS adopted the asylum policy set forth in the 2013 Kim \nMemorandum.  Nor do they consider any of the legislative history or congressional intent in \nenacting the TVPRA. \n110.  The 2019 Redetermination Memo is a final agency action under 5 U.S.C. § 704.  \nThe action “mark[s] the ‘consummation’ of the agency’s decisionmaking process” and it is not \n“of a merely tentative or interlocutory nature.”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 178 (1997).  The \nmemorandum marks the culmination of USCIS’s process for setting rules governing its \njurisdiction and legal consequences will flow from it, as existing asylum applicants will lose the \nright to seek relief from the asylum office and, in some instances, will have their applications \ndenied as time barred unless they can establish an exception to the bar.  \n111.  For any particular Plaintiff or class member whose asylum application under the \nTVPRA is rejected by USCIS on jurisdictional grounds, that rejection is itself a final action of \nUSCIS on the case.   \n26 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 91   Filed 12/20/19   Page 27 of 43\n \n \n112.  For any particular Plaintiff or class member in whose case ICE advocates for \nEOIR’s exercise of jurisdiction in derogation of USCIS’s initial jurisdiction, ICE acts to bring \nabout the final action of foreclosing a hearing of the claim in a non-adversarial setting and \neffectively transferring initial jurisdiction of the case to EOIR.   \n113.  The directives in the 2019 Redetermination Memo establish a binding norm and \nleave asylum officers with no discretion.  Specifically, the 2019 Redetermination Memo states, \n“The asylum officer must evaluate whether the asylum application was filed by a UAC by \nmaking an independent factual inquiry as to whether the individual met the UAC definition at the \ntime of first filing the asylum application.”  Ex. 1 at 3 (emphasis added).  Additionally, “[i]f \nEOIR has explicitly determined that USCIS does not have jurisdiction over an asylum \napplication because it is not one filed by a UAC, the asylum officer will defer to that \ndetermination.”  Ex. 1 at 4 n.5 (emphasis added). \n114.  The 2019 Redetermination Memo imposes new legal burdens on and alters the \nlegal rights and interests of asylum seekers who have previously been determined to be UACs.  \nSpecifically, the 2019 Redetermination Memo provides, “As the party invoking USCIS \njurisdiction, the individual filing for asylum bears the burden to establish that he or she met the \nUAC definition, which includes the applicant’s burden to establish his or her age, and that the \napplicant was unaccompanied, at the time of first filing the asylum application.”  Ex. 1 at 3.  It \nalso specifically defers to EOIR’s determination that USCIS lacks jurisdiction because the \nasylum application is not one filed by a UAC.  Ex. 1 at 4 n.5. \n115.  Defendants did not undertake notice-and-comment rulemaking prior to issuing the \n2019 Redetermination Memo. \n27 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 91   Filed 12/20/19   Page 28 of 43\n \n \n116.  The policy announced in the 2019 Redetermination Memo sets forth legislative \nrules and is thus not exempt from the APA’s requirements of notice and comment.  The 2019 \nRedetermination Memo reflects a legislative policy judgment, not merely interpretative \nguidance. \n  Defendants’ Failure to Promulgate Regulations Despite the TVPRA’s Mandate to Do So \n117.  The TVPRA expressly directs USCIS to promulgate regulations governing the \nhandling of asylum claims by UACs:  “Applications for asylum and other forms of relief from \nremoval in which an unaccompanied alien child is the principal applicant shall be governed by \nregulations which take into account the specialized needs of unaccompanied alien children and \nwhich address both procedural and substantive aspects of handling unaccompanied children’s \ncases.”  TVPRA § 235(d)(8); 8 U.S.C. § 1232(d)(8).   \n118.  In the fall of 2011, DHS and USCIS included in the Unified Agenda a proposed \nrule titled “Application of the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection \nReauthorization Act of 2008 to Unaccompanied Alien Children Seeking Asylum.”  RIN 1615-\nAB96.7  The notice indicated that the proposed “rule implements the provisions of the TVPRA” \nand acknowledged that “[t]he TVPRA mandated promulgation of regulations taking into account \nthe specialized needs of unaccompanied alien children and addressing both procedural and \nsubstantive aspects of handling unaccompanied children’s cases.”  The agencies did not publish \nthe text of the proposed rule. \n119.  DHS and USCIS included the same notice in the Unified Agenda again in 2012, \nSpring 2013, Fall 2013, Spring 2014, Fall 2014, Spring 2015, Fall 2015, Spring 2016, Fall 2016, \n                                                 \n7 Available at https://reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=201110&RIN=1615-\nAB96.   \n28 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 91   Filed 12/20/19   Page 29 of 43\n \n \nSpring 2017, Fall 2017, Spring 2018, and Fall 2018.  Yet in the eight years since first including \nthis notice in the Unified Agenda, the agencies have not published a Notice of Proposed \nRulemaking, and have made no progress toward promulgating regulations implementing the \nUAC provisions of the TVPRA. \nPlaintiffs Relied on USCIS’s 2013 Policy and the TVPRA and Will Be Deprived of \nTheir Right to Seek Asylum Before USCIS Under the New Policy and Will Be \nSeverely Harmed \n \n120.  Plaintiff M.E.R.E. entered the United States when he was 15 years old.  Upon \napprehension, he was determined by DHS to be a UAC.  \n121.  In reliance on the 2013 policy, M.E.R.E. first sought other forms of protection \nfrom removal, ultimately applying for asylum in March 2018 after reaching the age of 18.  As of \nthis filing, USCIS has not interviewed M.E.R.E. and his asylum application is still pending. \n122.  Under the new policy set forth in the 2019 Redetermination Memo, USCIS will \ndecline jurisdiction over M.E.R.E.’s asylum application because he filed after turning 18.  \nM.E.R.E. remains in removal proceedings before an immigration judge wherein an ICE \nprosecutor may advocate for EOIR jurisdiction and against USCIS jurisdiction.  If the \nimmigration judge makes a determination that USCIS does not have jurisdiction over M.E.R.E.’s \nasylum application, USCIS will reject jurisdiction over M.E.R.E.’s asylum application under the \n2019 Redetermination Memo.  M.E.R.E. will lose the protections associated with USCIS \njurisdiction over his asylum application and instead will be subject to an adversarial process in \nimmigration court where he will be cross-examined about the abuse and persecution he suffered \nas a child.  This will further delay the already extended period of time M.E.R.E. has waited for \nhis asylum application to be decided.  The added delay will continue to prevent M.E.R.E. from \npursuing his education.   \n29 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 91   Filed 12/20/19   Page 30 of 43\n \n \n123.  Because of the new policy set forth in the 2019 Redetermination Memo, the \ngovernment may conclude that M.E.R.E. is ineligible for asylum since he filed his application \nmore than one year after entering the United States. \n124.  Plaintiff M.A.L.C. entered the United States when he was 17 years old.  Upon \napprehension, he was determined by DHS to be a UAC. \n125.  In reliance on the 2013 policy, M.A.L.C. applied for asylum in February 2018, \nwhen he was 19 years old.  As of this filing, USCIS has not interviewed M.A.L.C. and his \nasylum application is still pending. \n126.  Under the new policy set forth in the 2019 Redetermination Memo, USCIS will \ndecline jurisdiction over M.A.L.C.’s asylum application because he filed after turning 18.  \nM.A.L.C. remains in removal proceedings before an immigration judge wherein an ICE \nprosecutor may advocate for EOIR jurisdiction and against USCIS jurisdiction.  If the \nimmigration judge makes a determination that USCIS does not have jurisdiction over M.A.L.C.’s \nasylum application, USCIS will reject jurisdiction over M.A.L.C.’s asylum application under the \n2019 Redetermination Memo.  M.A.L.C. will lose the protections associated with USCIS \njurisdiction over his asylum application and instead will be subject to an adversarial process in \nimmigration court where he will be cross-examined about the abuse and persecution he suffered \nas a child.  This will further delay the already extended period of time M.A.L.C. has waited for \nhis asylum application to be decided.    \n127.  Further, M.A.L.C. may be deemed ineligible for asylum at all because his \napplication was filed more than one year after he entered the United States. \n128.  Plaintiff K.A.R.C. entered the United States when he was 17 years old.  Upon \napprehension, he was determined by DHS to be a UAC. \n30 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 91   Filed 12/20/19   Page 31 of 43\n \n \n129.  In reliance on the 2013 policy, K.A.R.C. applied for asylum in the fall of 2017, \nwhen he was 18 years old.  K.A.R.C. had an asylum interview in November 2017.  As of this \nfiling, K.A.R.C. has not received a decision on his asylum application. \n130.  Under the new rules set forth in the 2019 Redetermination Memo, USCIS will \ndecline jurisdiction over K.A.R.C.’s asylum application because he filed after turning 18.  \nK.A.R.C. remains in removal proceedings before an immigration judge wherein an ICE \nprosecutor may advocate for EOIR jurisdiction and against USCIS jurisdiction.  If the \nimmigration judge makes a determination that USCIS does not have jurisdiction over K.A.R.C.’s \nasylum application, USCIS will reject jurisdiction over K.A.R.C.’s asylum application under the \n2019 Redetermination Memo.  K.A.R.C. will lose the protections associated with USCIS \njurisdiction over his asylum application and instead will be subject to an adversarial process in \nimmigration court where he will be cross-examined about the physical abuse he suffered at the \nhands of his father and brother and the rape and threats of physical violence by gang members.  \nThis will further delay the already extended period of time K.A.R.C. has waited for his asylum \napplication to be decided.  The added delay will prevent K.A.R.C. from pursuing a college \neducation.  \n131.  Further, K.A.R.C. may be deemed ineligible for asylum at all because his \napplication was filed more than one year after he entered the United States. \n132.  Plaintiff J.O.P. entered the United States when he was 15 years old.  Upon \napprehension, DHS determined him to be a UAC. \n133.  In reliance on the 2013 policy, J.O.P. applied for asylum in February 2018, still \nunder the age of 18, but after being reunited with his mother in the United States. As of this \nfiling, J.O.P. has not been scheduled for an asylum interview. \n31 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 91   Filed 12/20/19   Page 32 of 43\n \n \n134.  Under the new policy set forth in the 2019 Redetermination Memo, USCIS will \ndecline jurisdiction over J.O.P.’s asylum application because he filed after reuniting with his \nmother.  J.O.P. remains in removal proceedings before an immigration judge wherein an ICE \nprosecutor may advocate for EOIR jurisdiction and against USCIS jurisdiction.  If the \nimmigration judge makes a determination that USCIS does not have jurisdiction over J.O.P.’s \nasylum application, USCIS will reject jurisdiction over J.O.P.’s asylum application under the \n2019 Redetermination Memo.  J.O.P. will lose the protections associated with USCIS \njurisdiction over his asylum application and instead will be subject to an adversarial process in \nimmigration court where he will be cross-examined about the murder he witnessed and threats he \nreceived in his home country.  This will further delay the already extended period of time J.O.P. \nhas waited for his asylum application to be decided.    \n135.  Plaintiff E.D.G. entered the United States when he was 17 years old.  Upon \napprehension, he was determined by DHS to be a UAC. \n136.  In reliance on the 2013 policy, E.D.G. applied for asylum with USCIS in late \n2017, when he was 18 years old.  E.D.G. had an asylum interview with USCIS in March 2018.  \nOn October 10, 2018, before USCIS issued a decision on E.D.G.’s asylum claim, an immigration \njudge issued a decision concluding that it had jurisdiction over E.D.G.’s asylum application, \ndenying it on the merits, and ordering E.D.G. removed.  E.D.G. appealed his removal order to \nthe BIA, and that appeal remains pending.  \n137.  Under the new rules set forth in the 2019 Redetermination Memo, USCIS rejected \njurisdiction over E.D.G.’s asylum application in July 2019 because he had not established that he \nwas under 18 years old at the time he filed it.  On August 5, 2019, USCIS reopened E.D.G.’s \ncase in compliance with this Court’s TRO.  On September 30, 2019, while the Court’s TRO \n32 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 91   Filed 12/20/19   Page 33 of 43\n \n \nremained in effect, USCIS again rejected jurisdiction over E.D.G.’s asylum application relying \non the 2019 Redetermination Memo, this time deferring to the IJ’s October 10, 2018 \ndetermination that E.D.G. was not a UAC.  Specifically, USCIS issued a Notice of Lack of \nJurisdiction on grounds that the “Immigration Judge made an affirmative act to terminate UAC \nstatus on October 10, 2018.”  On November 22, 2019, Plaintiffs’ counsel filed a motion to \nenforce the preliminary injunction now in effect, seeking an order requiring Defendants to retract \nUSCIS’s September 30, 2019 jurisdictional rejection and to adjudicate E.D.G.’s case under the \n2013 policy.  \n138.  Because of the application of the new rules set forth in the 2019 Redetermination \nMemo, E.D.G. has lost the protections associated with USCIS jurisdiction over his asylum \napplication.  USCIS’s denial of jurisdiction over E.D.G.’s asylum application robs him of a basis \nupon which to move the BIA to remand his removal proceedings to the IJ to await USCIS’s \ndecision on the asylum application.  Had USCIS found jurisdiction over E.D.G.’s asylum \napplication and granted E.D.G. asylum, E.D.G. could have moved the IJ or the BIA to terminate \nhis removal proceedings.  USCIS’s delay in adjudicating his asylum claim forced E.D.G. into the \npainful position of having to testify for the second time to traumatic events that included sexual \nabuse for years as a child, this time in an adversarial setting that involved cross-examination by a \nDHS attorney. \nDefendants Have Continued to Delay or Obstruct USCIS Adjudication of Properly Filed \nCases, Resulting in the Abdication of USCIS’s Exercise of Initial Jurisdiction Through \nDelay or Deference to EOIR \n \n139.  This Court has issued a temporary restraining order (extended three times) and a \npreliminary injunction, each of which required Defendants to proceed with “consideration of \nsuch case[s] applying the 2013 UAC Memorandum.”  Yet, Defendant USCIS has rejected \n33 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 91   Filed 12/20/19   Page 34 of 43\n \n \njurisdiction over asylum applications where EOIR has wrongly asserted its own jurisdiction \nbased on its own factual determination as to a child’s age or the availability of a parent or \nguardian prior to the application date. \n140.  ICE acts as the prosecuting entity in the immigration courts.  Rather than acting in \nfurtherance of longstanding USCIS policy regarding the scope of USCIS initial jurisdiction, ICE \nactively opposes unaccompanied immigrant children’s efforts to hold their asylum claims in \nremoval proceedings in abeyance while those claims are properly before the USCIS asylum \noffice.  ICE is a component of Defendant DHS, and therefore subject to this Court’s Orders, yet \nICE regularly takes the position in immigration court that EOIR, not USCIS, has jurisdiction \nover an asylum claim that was properly filed with USCIS, and regularly advocates for the \nscheduling of an adversarial hearing on that claim in immigration court, rather than agreeing to \ncontinuances or other postponement to allow USCIS time to exercise and act on its initial \njurisdiction over the claim.   \n141.  Defendants have maintained a policy and practice that erroneously deprives \nPlaintiffs and the putative class members of USCIS’s statutory initial jurisdiction over their \nasylum applications, including through USCIS’s failure to act upon pending cases, and in \ncontinuing to follow the instruction in the 2019 Redetermination Memo that USCIS defer to \nEOIR’s determinations of USCIS’s jurisdiction.  ICE not only fails to contest such EOIR action \nbut actively opposes immigration court postponements to allow USCIS to exercise its initial \njurisdiction.  These practices are inconsistent with the TVPRA’s conferral of “initial jurisdiction” \nto USCIS in those cases.   \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n142.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the preceding allegations of this Complaint. \n34 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 91   Filed 12/20/19   Page 35 of 43\n \n \n143.  Plaintiffs bring this action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) on \nbehalf of themselves and a nationwide class of all other persons similarly situated. \n144.  Plaintiffs seek to represent the following nationwide class: \nAll individuals nationwide who prior to the effective date of a lawfully promulgated \npolicy prospectively altering the policy set forth in the 2013 Kim Memorandum  (1) were \ndetermined to be an Unaccompanied Alien Child; and (2) who had filed an asylum \napplication that was pending with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services \n(“USCIS”); and (3) on the date they filed their asylum application with USCIS, were 18 \nyears of age or older, or had a parent or legal guardian in the United States who is \navailable to provide care and physical custody; and (4) for whom USCIS has not \nadjudicated the individual’s asylum application on the merits. \n \n145.  Plaintiffs are each adequate representatives of the proposed class. \n146.  The proposed class satisfies the requirements of Rule 23(a)(1) because the class is \nso numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. \n147.  On information and belief, there are thousands of individuals who fit within the \nclass. \n148.  The class meets the commonality requirements of Rule 23(a)(2).  The members of \nthe class are all subject to the 2019 Redetermination Memo and will lose their right to proceed \nbefore USCIS on the basis of the new policy.  This lawsuit raises questions of law common to all \nmembers of the class, including whether Defendants have violated the class members’ due \nprocess rights; whether the 2019 Redetermination Memo is arbitrary and capricious under the \nAPA; and whether the 2019 Redetermination Memo is unlawful because it was not promulgated \npursuant to notice-and-comment as required by the APA. \n149.  The proposed class meets the typicality requirements of Rule 23(a)(3), because \nthe claims of the representative Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the class.  Plaintiffs and the \nproposed class share the same legal claims, which assert the same substantive and procedural \nrights under the due process clause, the APA, and the TVPRA. \n35 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 91   Filed 12/20/19   Page 36 of 43\n \n \n150.  The proposed class meets the adequacy requirements of Rule 23(a)(4).  The \nrepresentative Plaintiffs seek the same relief as other members of the class and have identical \ninterests to the class members in vigorously pursuing that relief.  In defending their own rights, \nPlaintiffs will defend the rights of all proposed class members fairly and adequately. \n151.  The proposed class also satisfies Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2).  \nDefendants have acted on grounds that are generally applicable to each class member.  Injunctive \nand declaratory relief is thus appropriate with respect to the class as a whole. \nCOUNT I \n(Administrative Procedure Act – The 2019 Redetermination Memo is Arbitrary, \nCapricious, or Otherwise Not in Accordance with Law) \n \n152.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the preceding allegations of this Complaint. \n153.  Title 5, U.S. Code § 706(2) authorizes a court to hold unlawful and set aside final \nagency action found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion (e.g., irrational), or \notherwise not in accordance with law, or in excess of statutory jurisdiction or authority. \n154.  The asylum policy set forth in the 2019 Redetermination Memo is arbitrary, \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, not in accordance with law, and is inconsistent with the \nTVPRA, and therefore in violation of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \n155.  The 2019 Redetermination Memo violates the TVPRA because the asylum rules \nset forth therein are contrary to its plain language.  The 2019 Redetermination Memo mandates \nthat all asylum officers must evaluate, in all cases, whether an applicant met the statutory \ndefinition of a UAC at the time of filing the asylum application, and that all asylum officers must \ndefer to EOIR’s determination that USCIS lacks jurisdiction over an asylum application because \nit is not one filed by a UAC.  This mandate applies in all cases, even where an individual had \npreviously been determined to be a UAC.  These mandates are contrary to the structure and text \n36 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 91   Filed 12/20/19   Page 37 of 43\n \n \nof the TVPRA, which plainly establish that a child’s UAC status determination occurs upon the \nchild’s initial contact with a federal government department or agency and is not subject to \nredetermination by USCIS, and that once filed, USCIS has initial jurisdiction over the \napplication.   \n156.  The 2019 Redetermination Memo is arbitrary and capricious because, for \nexample, it does not address, nor acknowledge, any of the reasons for adopting the asylum policy \nin place since 2013 for UACs seeking asylum before USCIS.  Defendants have failed to provide \nany explanation, much less a reasoned explanation, of how the 2019 Redetermination Memo \naddresses the issues leading to the adoption of the 2013 Kim Memorandum, or why consistency \nwith Board of Immigration Appeals precedent relates to whether a UAC has subsequently been \nreunited with a parent or assigned a legal guardian.  \n157.  The 2019 Redetermination Memo is also arbitrary and capricious because it fails \nto consider the reliance interests of children, including Plaintiffs, with pending asylum \napplications who had relied in good faith on the asylum policy in place since 2013. \n158.  Notwithstanding the Court’s preliminary injunction, Defendants have perpetuated \nthis arbitrary and capricious policy by advocating for EOIR determinations of UAC status, by \ndelaying USCIS determination of cases and thereby allowing EOIR adversarial merits hearings \nto go forward without any USCIS adjudication. \nCOUNT II \n(The 2019 Redetermination Memo Violates Due Process) \n \n159.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the preceding allegations of this Complaint. \n160.  Defendants violate Plaintiffs’ due process rights by retroactively applying the \nasylum rules set forth in the 2019 Redetermination Memo.  Plaintiffs filed for asylum reasonably \nexpecting to benefit from all the protections and rights accorded by the TVPRA to UACs, as \n37 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 91   Filed 12/20/19   Page 38 of 43\n \n \noutlined by the 2013 Kim Memorandum.  Yet the 2019 Redetermination Memo will actually \npenalize the Plaintiffs’ past conduct taken in reliance on USCIS policy in place since 2013. \n161.  The asylum policy set forth in the 2019 Redetermination Memo changes the legal \nlandscape for child asylum applicants by radically rewriting the terms under which applicants \nlike the Plaintiffs, who have been determined to be UACs, can seek asylum.  Pursuant to the \nasylum policy promulgated by the 2013 Kim Memorandum, USCIS had initial jurisdiction over \neach of the Plaintiffs’ asylum applications based on DHS’s prior determination that each Plaintiff \nwas a UAC.  Without any meaningful notice to the public, USCIS has changed the rules and \nstated unequivocally that it will apply its new jurisdictional requirements even to applications \nthat were pending with the agency before the new policy’s effective date.  Application of the \nnew asylum policy will prevent USCIS from hearing the Plaintiffs’ asylum claims, thereby \ndepriving them of the protections Congress provided for UACs in the TVPRA.   By subjecting \nPlaintiffs to a one-year bar on filing an asylum applications, application of the new asylum \npolicy will render Plaintiffs completely ineligible for asylum unless they are able to carry the \nburden of establishing one of two narrow exceptions to the bar in immigration court. \n162.  The 2019 Redetermination Memo violates the procedural protections of the Fifth \nAmendments’ Due Process Clause.  The 2019 Redetermination Memo is therefore “contrary to \nconstitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity” and invalid under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). \nCOUNT III \n(Failure to Follow APA Procedure with the 2019 Redetermination Memo) \n \n163.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the preceding allegations of this Complaint. \n164.  Under the Administrative Procedure Act, an agency must provide “[g]eneral \nnotice of proposed rulemaking . . . published in the Federal Register” whenever the agency seeks \nto promulgate a rule.  5 U.S.C. § 553(b).  Exempt from this requirement are “interpretive rules, \n38 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 91   Filed 12/20/19   Page 39 of 43\n \n \ngeneral statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice.”  Id.  After \nthe agency has published the required notice, “the agency shall give interested persons an \nopportunity to participate in the rule making through submission of written data, views, or \narguments.”  Id. § 553(c). \n165.  Defendants did not provide notice of proposed rulemaking, nor did they invite \ncomments from interested persons before issuing the 2019 Redetermination Memo. \n166.  None of the statutory exceptions to the requirement of notice-and-comment \nrulemaking is applicable here.  See 5 U.S.C. § 553(b).  \n167.  The asylum rules set forth in the 2019 Redetermination Memo are legislative \nrules, not interpretive rules, because, for example, they effect a substantive change in existing \nlaw. \n168.  The 2019 Redetermination Memo is not a statement of policy that is exempt from \npublic notice, including because it establishes binding rules on all asylum officers without \nleaving room for any exercise of discretion. \n169.  The asylum policy set forth in the 2019 Redetermination Memo does not \nconstitute rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice. \n170.  The May 2019 Policy Memorandum was issued “without observance of procedure \nrequired by law” and is invalid under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \nCOUNT IV \n(Administrative Procedure Act – Failure to Exercise Initial Jurisdiction is Arbitrary, \nCapricious, and Otherwise Not in Accordance with Law \n \n171.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the preceding allegations of this Complaint. \n39 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 91   Filed 12/20/19   Page 40 of 43\n \n \n172.  Title 5, U.S. Code § 706(2) authorizes a court to hold unlawful and set aside final \nagency action found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion (e.g., irrational), or \notherwise not in accordance with law, or in excess of statutory jurisdiction or authority. \n173.  USCIS’s adoption of a policy to defer to an EOIR determination as to whether an \nasylum applicant is a UAC, as specifically announced in the 2019 Redetermination Memo, is \narbitrary and capricious because it departs from the 2013 Kim Memorandum without \nacknowledgement or adequate explanation and is contrary to the TVPRA.  Under the statutory \ngrant of UAC asylum initial jurisdiction in the TVPRA, USCIS must make its own jurisdiction \ndeterminations and may not merely defer to another agency’s jurisdictional findings.  Under the \n2013 Kim Memorandum, UAC asylum applicants are entitled to seek asylum before USCIS, \nregardless of any EOIR determination to the contrary. \n174.  A USCIS policy to defer to an immigration judge’s determination as to whether \nan asylum applicant is a UAC is arbitrary and capricious because it fails to consider the serious \nreliance interests of asylum applicants who relied on the 2013 Kim Memorandum.  \nCOUNT V \n (USCIS’s and DHS’s Acts Fail to Follow APA Procedure) \n \n175.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the preceding allegations of this Complaint. \n176.  Under the Administrative Procedure Act, an agency must provide “[g]eneral \nnotice of proposed rulemaking . . . published in the Federal Register” whenever the agency seeks \nto promulgate a rule.  5 U.S.C. § 553(b).  Exempt from this requirement are “interpretive rules, \ngeneral statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice.”  Id.  After \nthe agency has published the required notice, “the agency shall give interested persons an \nopportunity to participate in the rule making through submission of written data, views, or \narguments.”  Id. § 553(c). \n40 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 91   Filed 12/20/19   Page 41 of 43\n \n \n177.  USCIS did not provide notice of proposed rulemaking, and did not invite \ncomments from interested persons, before engaging in a policy of deferring to an immigration \njudge as to whether an asylum applicant qualifies as a UAC, as it announced in the 2019 \nRedetermination Memo. \n178.  None of the statutory exceptions to the requirement of notice-and-comment \nrulemaking is applicable here.  See 5 U.S.C. § 553(b).  \n179.  USCIS’s policy was adopted “without observance of procedure required by law” \nand is invalid under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs request that the Court: \na)  Declare that the 2019 Redetermination Memorandum is unlawful; \nb)  Vacate the 2019 Redetermination Memorandum; \nc)  Enjoin Defendants DHS, USCIS, and the respective Acting Directors from enforcing or \napplying any aspect of the 2019 Redetermination Memorandum; \nd)  Order that Defendants are permanently enjoined and restrained from relying on the 2019 \nRedetermination Memorandum as a basis to decline jurisdiction over asylum \napplications, to subject an asylum applicant to the one-year time limit for filing described \nat 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B), or for any other purpose;  \ne)  Enjoin USCIS from deferring to EOIR determinations in assessing its jurisdiction over \nasylum applications filed by Plaintiffs and members of the proposed class; \nf)  Order that, consistent with the terms of the 2013 Kim Memorandum, with respect to \nPlaintiffs and members of the proposed class, USCIS shall: \n1.  Exercise initial jurisdiction over such individuals’ asylum applications; \n2.  Adjudicate such applications on the merits regardless of whether EOIR has \nasserted jurisdiction over the asylum claim; and \n \n3.  In conducting such merits adjudications, apply 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(E) to \nhold such applicants exempt from the one-year time limit for filing asylum \napplications; \n \n41 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 91   Filed 12/20/19   Page 42 of 43\n \n \ng)  Enjoin Defendants ICE and Albence from ICE advocacy during the immigration court \nremoval proceedings of any Plaintiff or member of the proposed class (including EOIR \nproceedings before immigration judges and members of the Board of Immigration \nAppeals) seeking any of the following where such individual’s asylum application is \npending before USCIS: \n1.  Determinations of jurisdictional facts pertaining to age or unaccompanied \nstatus;  \n2.  Denials of continuances or other postponements in order to await adjudication \nof an asylum application that has been or will be filed with USCIS;  \n3.  EOIR exercise of jurisdiction over any asylum claim where USCIS has initial \njurisdiction under the terms of the 2013 Kim Memorandum; or \n4.  Otherwise taking the position in such individual’s removal proceedings that \nUSCIS does not have initial jurisdiction over the individual’s asylum \napplication; and \nh)  Order that USCIS will retract any adverse decision already rendered in an individual case \napplying the 2019 Redetermination Memorandum and reinstate consideration of such \ncase under the 2013 Kim Memorandum by a date certain; \ni)  Enjoin Defendants from taking adverse adjudicatory or enforcement action against \nPlaintiffs or members of the proposed class during the pendency of this litigation; \nj)  Grant Plaintiffs their costs in this action, including reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred \npursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2412; and  \nk)  Award other relief that the Court deems just and proper. \n \n \n  \n   \n42 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 91   Filed 12/20/19   Page 43 of 43\n \n \nDated: December 20, 2019   \n   \n   \nRespectfully submitted,   \n   \n/s/ Brian T.

Plaintiffs  allege  as  follows. \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  Plaintiffs  are  among  thousands  of unaccompanied  immigrant  children  who  have \nmade  the  long  and  perilous journey  to  the  United  States  to  seek protection,  fleeing  violence  and \n1\nCase  8:19-cv-01944-GJH  Document1  Filed  07/01/19  Page  2  of  32 \npersecution  in  their  countries  of origin.  This  class  action  challenges  a  federal  agency’s  sudden \nshift  in  policy  that  retroactively  strips  Plaintiffs  of critical,  statutory  asylum  protections. \n2,  Recognizing  the  vulnerability  and  special  needs  of unaccompanied  unmugrant \nchildren,  Congress  has  enacted  laws  specifically  designed  to  protect them.  In  2008,  Congress \nenacted  the  Wilham  Wilberforce  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization  Act \nCTVPRA”).  The  TVPRA  provides  multiple  protections  to  unaccompanied  immigrant  children, \nwho  are  often  vulnerable  to  trafficking,  persecution,  trauma,  and  other  harms  en  route  to  or  while \nin  the  United  States. \n3,  The  TVPRA  draws  on  a  prior  statutory  definition  according  to  which  an \n“unaccompanied  alien  child”  CUAC”)  is  one  whom  the  federal  government  determines  to  be \nwithout  lawful  immigration  status,  under  the  age  of  18,  and  without  a  parent  or  legal  guardian  in \nthe  United  States  available  to  provide  care  and  physical  custody.  6  U.S.C.  §  279(2)(2). \nPlamtifs  were  each  apprehended  by  Defendant  DHS  upon  entering  the  United  States  and \ndetermined  by  a DHS  agent  to  satisfy  this  definition. \nA,  The  TVPRA  relieves  unaccompanied  immigrant  children  of two  procedural \nhurdles  to  accessing  the  asylum  system,  providing  a more  child-appropriate  way  for  the \ngovernment to  process  their  claims  to  protection  under  U.S.  and  international  law  fairly. \n5.  First,  the  TVPRA  creates  an  exception  to  the  general  requirement  that  applicants \nfacing  removal  proceedings  present their  asylum  claims  im  an  adversarial  setting  before  the \nimmigration  court.  Instead,  the  TVPRA  allows  unaccompanied  immigrant  children  to  pursue \nasylum  in  the  first  instance  through  a  non-adversarial  administrative  interview  with  a  trained \nasvium  officer  within  USCIS,  a process  more  appropriate  for  traumatized  young  applicants.\nCase  8:19-cv-01944-GJH  Document1  Filed  07/01/19  Page  3  of  32 \n6.  Second,  the  TVPRA  exempts  unaccompanied  immigrant  children  from  a  one-year \nfiling  deadline  that  otherwise  applies  to  asylum  applicants.  Without that  TVPRA  exemption, \napplicants  filing  later  than  one  year  after  entering  the  United  States  must  establish  that  they  merit \nan  exception  to  the  one-year  filing  deadline. \n7.  Under  a  policy  USCIS  adopted  effective  June  2013  to  implement these  TVPRA \nasylum  protections,  Plaintiffs,  and  all  other  unaccompanied  children  seeking  asylum  in  the \nUnited  States,  were  entitled  to  access  the  TVPRA  asylum  process  once  they  had  been  determined \nto  be  a UAC  upon  their  initial  apprehension  by  DHS,  and  that  determination  remained  in  place. \nUnder  the  2013  policy,  USCIS  exercised  initial jurisdiction  over  an  unaccompanied  child’s \nasylum  claim  regardless  of whether  the  applicant  had  turned  18  or  been  appointed  a  legal \nguardian  before  applying  for  asylum. \n  \n8.  The  permanent  protections  enacted  by  Congress  in  the  TVPRA  are  unlawfully \ncurtailed  by  Defendants’  recent  actions.  On  June  14,  2019,  Defendant  USCIS  posted  a \nmemorandum  dated  May  31,  2019  (the  “2019  Redetermination  Memo”)  to  its  website \nannouncing  significant  changes  to  how  USCIS  will  implement the  TVPRA,  effective  on  June  30, \n2019.'  USCIS  did  not  publish  the  2019  Redetermination  Memo  in  the  Federal  Register,  and  the \nagency  did  not  invite  public  comment  on  any  of the  new  directives  set  forth  in  the  memorandum. \n9.  The  2019  Redetermination  Memo  now  mandates  that,  beginning  on  June  30, \n2019,  an  asylum  officer  must  make  an  independent  factual  inquiry  to  redetermine  whether  an \napplicant  met the  statutory  definition  of a UAC  on  their  filing  date—even  if that  filing  date  was \nyears  ago,  when  the  prior  policy  was  in  effect.  If USCIS  determines  that the  individual  no  longer \n  \n'  Ex.  1,  U.S.  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Services,  Updated  Procedures  for Asylum \nApplications  Filed  by  Unaccompanied  Alien  Children  (May  31,  2019), \nhttps://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/refugees-asylum/asylum/minor-children-applying-asylum- \nthemselves.\nCase  8:19-cv-01944-GJH  Document1  Filed  07/01/19  Page 4  of  32 \nsatished  the  definition  on  the  date  the  individual  applied  for  asylum,  USCIS  will  decline \njurisdiction  over  the  asylum  application.  Moreover,  based  on  the  same  determination,  USCIS \nmust  also  conclude  that  an  applicant  is  not  entitled  to  the  related  protection  that  exempts  UACs \nfrom  the  one-year  deadline  for  filing  asylum  applications. \nLO.  The  2019  Redetermination  Memo  applies  to  any  USCIS  decision  issued  on  or \napplving  to  individuals  who  already  had  asylum  applications  pending  before  USCIS,  even  those \nwhom  USCIS  already  mterviewed,  as  of June  30,  2019,  as  well  as  to  others  who  have  relied  upon \nUSCIS’s  2013  policy. \nLI.  The  2019  Redetermination  Memo  marks  a  drastic  change  in  USCIS  policy  and  a \ndeparture  from  the  protections  in  the  TVPRA  that  profoundly  undermines  Plaintiffs’  rights,  and \nthe  rights  of other  unaccompanied  children  who  have  filed  for  or  pian  to  file  for  asylum  in  the \nUnited  States.  Under  the  policy  im  place  since  2013,  Plaintiffs  were  entitled  to  seek  asylum \nbefore  USCIS  and  were  relieved  from  the  requirement  to  show  that  they  either  had  filed  within \none  year  or  qualified  for  an  exception  to  that  general  deadline.  Under  the  new  policy,  they  will \nbe  deprived  of their  right  to  seek  asylum  before  USCIS,  and  will  face  an  adversarial  process  im \nwhich  a DHS  prosecutor  subjects  them  to  cross  examination  and  advocates  for  their  deportation. \nFurther,  Plaintiifs  may  lose  their  eligibility  to  seek  asylum  entirely  by  retroactive  imposition  of a \nfiling  deadime  that  was  inapplicable  to  their  applications  at the  time  they  were  filed.  The  policy \nthus  undermines  the  core  purpose  of the  TVPRA  to  provide  procedural  protections  to  vulnerable \nchildren  seeking  asylum. \n12.  The  2019  Redetermination  Memo  is  the  latest  in  a  long  line  of recent  policies \nadopted  in  an  effort  to  curtail  the  rights  of unaccompanied  children  and  others  seeking  asylum\nCase  8:19-cv-01944-GJH  Document1  Filed  07/01/19  Page  5  of  32 \nand  other  protections  in  the  United  States,  as  revealed  by  a  leaked  DHS  memorandum,  titled \n“Policy  Options  to  Respond  to  Border  Surge  of Illegal  Immigration”  (herein,  the  “Policy  Options \nList”)  (Ex.  2).2,  Among  the  listed  “options”  for  responding  to  a  “border  surge”  is  a  summary  of \nthe  policies  announced  in  the  2019  Redetermination  Memo,  appearing  alongside  the  Trump \nAdministration’s  policy  to  separate  children  from  their  families  after  entry  as  a means  of \ndeterrence.  Ex.  2  at  1-2.  Despite  acknowledging  that  the  2013  USCIS  asylum  policy  “affords \nthe  minors  the  protections  under  the  Trafficking  in  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization  Act \n(TVPRA),”  the  author  proposed  to  rescind  that  policy,  which  is  referred  to  in  a  margin \nannotation  as  “misguided.”  /d.  at  2. \n13.  In  making  these  significant  and  harmful  policy  changes  that  undermine  the \npurpose  of and  are  inconsistent with  the  TVPRA,  without  providing  notice  or  opportunity  to \ncomment,  and  by  announcing  their  intent to  apply  the  new  policy  retroactively,  Defendants  have \nviolated  the  TVPRA  itself,  the  Administrative  Procedures  Act  (“APA”),  and  the  constitutional \ndue  process  rights  of children  who  seek to  access  the  statutory  asylum  system  in  the  United \nStates. \n14.  Plaintiffs  seek the  Court’s  immediate  intervention  so  that they  and  others \nsimilarly  situated  may  exercise  their  right  to  seek  asylum  before  USCIS  and  maintain  their \nstatutory  exemption  from  the  general  one-year  filing  deadline.  Defendants’  actions  have  caused \nand,  unless  enjoined,  will  continue  to  cause  serious  and  irreparable  harm  to  Plaintiffs  and  to  the \nproposed  class.  Plaintiffs  therefore  seek  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief from  this  Court  to  end \nthese  violations  and  harms. \n  \n*  Available  at  https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5688664-Merkleydocs2.html.  On \n \ninformation  and  belief,  the  leaked  memorandum  was  provided  to  NBC  News  by  the  office  of \nSen.  Jeff Merkley,  which  obtained  the  memorandum  from  a  government whistleblower. \n5 \nCase  8:19-cv-01944-GJH  Document1  Filed  07/01/19  Page  6  of  32 \nPLAINTIFFS \n15.

See  Local  Rule  501. \nFACTUAL  BACKGROUND \nPassage  of the  TVPRA  in  2008 \nAS.  Before  2002,  the  care  and  placement  of unaccompanied  children  in  the  United \nStates  was  the  responsibility  of the  Office  of Juvenile  Affairs  in  the  former  Immigration  and \nNaturalization  Service  (“INS”).  In  2002,  Congress  enacted  the  Homeland  Security  Act  (“HSA”). \nPub.  L.  No.  107-296,  116  Stat.  2153.  The  HSA  created  DHS  and  transferred  most  immigration \nfunctions  formerly  performed  by  INS  to  the  newly  formed  DHS  and  its  components,  including \nUSCIS,  Custom  Border  Protection  (“CBP”),  and  U.S.  Immigration  and  Customs  Enforcement \n(“ICE”). \n46.  |The  HSA  defined  an  “unaccompanied  alien  child”  as  a  child  who:  “(A)  has  no \nlawful  immigration  status  in  the  United  States;  (B)  has  not  attained  18  years  of age;  and  (C)  with \nrespect  to  whom—(1)  there  is  no  parent  or  legal  guardian  in  the  United  States;  or  (11)  no  parent  or \nlegal  guardian  in  the  United  States  is  available  to  provide  care  and  physical  custody.”  HSA \n462(g)(2);  6  U.S.C.  §  279(g)(2).  Congress  transferred  to  the  Office  for  Refugee  Resettlement \n(“ORR”),  within  the  Department  of Health  and  Human  Services  (“HHS”),  the  responsibility  for \n9\nCase  8:19-cv-01944-GJH  Document1  Filed  07/01/19  Page  10  of  32 \nthe  care  of UACs  “who  are  in  Federal  custody  by  reason  of their  ummigration  status.”  HSA \n462(a),  (DCA);  6  ULS.C.  §  2794),  (b)(1  CA). \nAT.  Six  years  later,  Congress  passed  the  TVPRA,  which  was  signed  into  law  on \nDecember  23,  2008  and  took  effect  in  March  2009.  In  addition  to  measures  to  combat \ninternational  and  domestic  human  trafficking,  including  trafficking  of children,  the  TVPRA \nrecognized  the  vulnerability  of children  fleeing  their  countries  of origin  to  seek  protection  in  the \nUnited  States,  and  responded  with  multiple  provisions  addressing  safe  custody  and  child- \nappropriate  procedures  for  unaccompanied  children. \nAS.  —_ In  structuring  the  TVPRA,  Congress  placed  legal  protections  for  UACs,  inchiding \nprovisions  on  asylum,  ina  section  of the  statute  titled  “Permanent  protection  for  certain  al-risk \nchildren.”  TVPRA  §  235(d). \n49.  Among  other  safeguards,  the  TVPRA  provides  that  USCIS  has  mitial jurisdiction \nover  a UAC’s  asylum  application,  even  where  the  UAC  is  in  removal  proceedings—a  deviation \nfrom  the  ordinary  rule  that  “affirmative”  asylum  before  USCES  is  only  available  to  those  who  are \nnot  in  proceedings.  TVPRA  §  235(d7);  8  USC.  §  EIS&OOGKC).  Conterring  inital \njurisdiction  on  USCIS  instead  of an  Immigration  Judge  provides  a non-adversarial  system  more \nsensitive  to  the  special  needs  of child  immigrants  who  lack  understanding  of how  to  navigate  an \nunmigration  system  designed  for  adults,  and  who  likely  sought  safety  in  the  United  States \nwithout  understanding  the  legal  options  that  exist,  including  asylum.  Instead  of having  to  be \ncross  exanuned  in  an  adversarial  courtroom  by  trained  government  lawyers  (without  the  right  to \nappointed  counsel),  a  UAC  applicant  is  seen  by  USCIS  asylum  officers  trained  to  conduct  non- \nadversarial  interviews  and  apply  child-sensitive  and  trauma-mformed  interview  techniques.\nCase  8:19-cv-01944-GJH  Document1  Filed  07/01/19  Page  11  of  32 \n50.  Generally,  asylum  applicants  must  file  ther  asylum  application within  one  vear \nafter  entering  the  United  States,  subject  to  two  lnmited  exceptions.  8  ULS.C.  §  1158(a)(2)(B). \nRecognizing  that  children  were  forced  to  struggle  through  a  system  designed  for  adults,  even \nthough  they  lack  the  capacity  to  understand  nuanced  legal  prmciples,  let  alone  courtroom  and \nadmunistrative  procedures,  the  second  TVPRA  protection  at  issue  here  makes  the  one-year  filing \ndeadline  inapplicable  to  UACs.  TVPRA  §  235(d)(7);  8  U.S.C.  §  LIS8Q)CNE).  Accordingly,  a \nUAC  who  was  unable  to  file  withm  one  year  will  not  be  required  to  demonstrate  changed  or \nextraordmary  circumstances  relating  to  the  delay  in  filing  the  application,  and  that the  application \nwas  nonetheless  filed  in  a reasonable  time.  See  8  U.S.C.  8  1158(ay2\\(D):;  8  CER.  § \n208 4¢aK{S). \nSi.  The  TVPRA  also  requires  that  federal  officials  who  discover  a UAC  must  transfer \nthe  UAC  fo  the  custody  of HHS  within  a  72-hour  period  (absent  exceptional  circumstances),  for \ncare  and  custody.  TVPRA  §  235(b)(3);  8  ULS.C.  §  1232(b\\3).  This  requirernent  places  UACs \nunder  the  care  of an  agency  set  up  to  provide  for  their  safety  and  welfare,  rather  than  an  agency \nwhose  mission  is  to  enforce  immigration  laws.  For  example,  HHS  contracts  with  agencies  who \nhave  social  workers  on  staff who  are  tramed  to  work  with  children. \n52.  Nothing  inthe  TVPRA  directs  or  authorizes  any  government  agency  to  rescind  a \ndetermination  that  a  child  is  a UAC,  or to  abrogate  the  asylum  procedures  that  apply  to  a  child \ndetermined  to  be  a UAC. \n53.  Inthe  words  of Senator  Dianne  Feinstein,  a  co-author  of the  TVPRA  provisions, \ntheir  purpose  was  “to  ensure  that  unaccompanied  children  receive  humane  and  appropriate\nCase  8:19-cv-01944-GJH  Document1  Filed  07/01/19  Page  12  of  32 \ntreatment while  in  the  custody  of the  U.S.  Government”?  and  to  “give  unaccompanied  minors \naccess  to  pro  bono  legal  counsel  and  someone  to  look  after their  best  interest.”  154  Cong.  Rec. \nS10886  (daily  ed.  Dec.  10,  2008).  Senator  Feinstein  explained  that: \nI  believe  we  have  a  special  obligation  to  ensure  that these  children  are  treated \nhumanely  and  fairly.  Unfortunately,  without this  legislation,  there  would  be  no \nprocedure  to  make  sure  that  happens.  Currently,  when  a  child  is  apprehended  by \nimmigration  authorities,  that  child  usually  knows  nothing  about  U.S.  courts  or \nimmigration  policies  and  frequently  does  not  speak  English. \nId. \n54.  Congress  instructed  USCIS,  in  order  to  properly  administer  the  TVPRA,  to  enact \n“regulations  which  take  into  account the  specialized  needs  of unaccompanied  alien  children  and \nwhich  address  both  procedural  and  substantive  aspects  of handling  unaccompanied  alien \nchildren’s  cases.”  TVPRA  §  235(d)(8);  8  U.S.C.  §  1232(d)(8).  USCIS  has  failed  to  enact  any \nsuch  regulations  in  the  ten  years  since  Congress  passed  the  TVPRA. \nInitial  Implementation  of the  TVPRA  and  the  September  2012  Office  of the  Citizenship \nand  Immigration  Services  Ombudsman’s  Report \n55.  In  2009,  USCIS  issued  a memorandum  instructing  asylum  officers  on  the  rules  to \nfollow  for  evaluation  of asylum  applications  filed  by  UACs  in  removal  proceedings.  Ex.  3 \n(March  25,  2009  Memorandum  re:  /mplementation  of Statutory  Change  Providing  USCIS with \nInitial Jurisdiction  over Asylum Applications  Filed by  Unaccompanied Alien  Children).

The  2009 \nmemorandum  states  that  “[f]ederal  regulations  will  ultimately  be  promulgated  in  order to  reflect \nthe  procedures  established  for  USCIS  initial jurisdiction.”  /d.  at  1. \n56.  |  The  procedures  set  forth  in  the  2009  memorandum  were  contrary  to  the  TVPRA, \nas  acknowledged  by  the  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Services  Ombudsman  (“Ombudsman’”).’ \nOn  September  20,  2012,  the  Ombudsman  issued a  report,  titled  Ensuring a Fair  and Efficient \nAsylum  Process for  Unaccompanied Minor  Children  (the  “2012  Ombudsman  Report’)  (Ex.  4), \nproviding  an  independent  analysis  of problems  encountered  by  UACs  seeking  asylum  in  the \nUnited  States,  and  recommendations  to  improve  the  process.  The  Ombudsman  recognized  that \nUSCIS  had  failed  to  implement the  “statutorily  required  regulations”  for  UACs  seeking  asylum. \nInstead,  USCIS  had  “developed  and  implemented  certain  temporary  policies  and  procedures  for \nUAC  asylum-seekers.”  /d.  at  3. \n57.  To  complete  its  review,  the  Ombudsman  “interviewed  USCIS  Asylum  Division \nmanager  and  staff at  Headquarters  and  seven  of the  eight Asylum  Offices,  EOIR  officials,  and \nstakeholders  throughout the  country.”  Ex.  4  at  2.  The  Ombudsman  “also  studied  case  assistance \nrequests  and  reported  incidents  submitted  directly  to  [its]  office  by  stakeholders.”  Jd. \n58.  According  to  the  Ombudsman,  “Congress  did  not  provide  language  indicating  that \nthe  filing  of an  asylum  application  should  trigger  a new  or  successive  UAC  determinations  that \ncould  eliminate  statutory  protections  or  remove  the  UAC  from  [removal]  proceedings.”  /d.  at  5. \n59.  The  Ombudsman  also  recognized  that the  “IT'VPRA’s  procedural  and  substantive \nprotections  were  designed  to  remain  available  to  UACs  throughout  removal  proceedings, \n  \n*  The  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Services  Ombudsman,  established  by  the  Homeland  Security \nAct  of 2002,  provides  independent  analysis  of problems  encountered  by  individuals  interacting \nwith  U.S.  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Services,  and  proposes  changes  to  mitigate  those \nproblems.

Subjecting  a  child  seeking  asylum  to \nmultiple  UAC  determinations  a5  1s  required  by  USCIS’  temporary  guidance  appears  at  odds  with \nthe  TVPRA’s  express  purpose,  namely,  to  provide  tunely,  appropriate  relief for  vulnerable \nchildren.”  Jd. \n60.  The  Ombudsman  recognized  that,  when  a  child  is  placed  in  removal  proceedings, \nthe  apprehending  entity,  whether  ICE  or  CBP,  “must  make  a  finding  that the  child  is \nunaccompanied.”  /d  at  5.  However,  in  the  period  between  enactment  of the  TVPRA  and \npromulgation  of the  2013  policy,  USCIS  routinely  revisited  determinations  that  a  child  was  a \nUAC,  inquiring  into  whether  the  applicant  was  a UAC  at  the  date  of filing  an  asylum  application \nand  at the  date  of the  asylum  interview.  fd  at  3-4.  Based  on  such  redeterminations,  USCIS \ndeclined  to  exercise  its  initial yurisdiction  over  some  children  who  had  filed  applications  with \nUSCIS  pursuant to  the  TVPRA  provisions.  /d.  at  6. \n61.  In  the  2012  Ombudsman  Report,  the  Ombudsman  outlined  numerous  problems \nthat  flowed  from  redetermiming  UAC  status  at  asylum  interviews,  including  inefficiencies \nattendant  upon  scheduling  and  conducting  interviews  only  to  disclaim jurisdiction  in  nearly  half \nthe  cases  (id.  at  6);  officers  assessing  complex  parent-child  relationships  without  specialized \ntraining  Gd.  at  7).  and  undermining  predictability  and  uniformity  in  the  handling  of children’s \ncases  Ud.  at  6}.  The  Ombudsman  explained  that  instead  of “facilitating  expedited,  non- \nadversarial  interviews  envisioned  by  Congress,”  the  USCIS  policy  of undertaking  a \nredetermination  of UAC  status  at  every  asylum  interview  created  “delay  and  confusion.”  /a  at \n4, \n62.  Recognizing  the  deficiencies  m  this  process,  the  Ombudsman  made  a number  of \nrecommendations  “[tlo  address  confusion  related  to  UAC  redeterminations,  facilitate  improved\nCase  8:19-cv-01944-GJH  Document1  Filed  07/01/19  Page  15  of  32 \ninterview  techniques  and  adjudications,  and  reduce  post-interview  processing  delays.”  /d.  at  1-2. \nAs  the  Ombudsman  noted: \nA  child’s  living  circumstances  or  relationship  with  his  or  her  family  may  be \ndynamic,  so  the  child  may  fall  both  within  and  without  of the  UAC  definition \nwhile  present  in  the  United  States.  Given  this  fluidity,  as  well  as  inconsistencies \nin  practice  by  DHS  and  EOIR,  legal  advocates  believe  that the  UAC  definition \nitself is  too  vague  and  impractical,  and  that the  status,  once  attached,  should \nremain  with  a  child  through  the  pendency  of his  or  her  case. \nId.  at  4. \n63.  The  Ombudsman  recommended  that  USCIS  accept jurisdiction  of an  asylum \napplication  filed  by  a  child  whom  a  federal  agency  had  previously  determined  to  be  a  UAC.  /d. \nat  4-5. \n64.  As  the  Ombudsman  correctly  concluded  based  on  its  extensive  assessment, \n“le |liminating  the  practice  of USCIS  redetermining  UAC  status  during  the  asylum  interview \nwould  also  restore  a  level  of fairness  that  comes  from  having  a predictable  and  uniform  process.” \nId.  at  6.  According  to  the  Ombudsman,  the  practice  of “adopt[ing  a]  UAC  determination  made \nfor  custody  purposes  by  CBP  and  ICE...  will  positively  affect  all  minors  apprehended  and \nplaced  into  federal  custody  with  the  HHS,  helping  to  ensure  a  consistent  process  for  scores  of \nchildren  who  seek  asylum  in  the  United  States.’ \nUSCIS  Response  to  the  Ombudsman’s  Report  and  the  2013  Kim  Memorandum \n65.

The \n2019  Redetermination  Memo,  dated  May  31,  2019,  is  authored  by  John  Lafferty  (Chief,  Asylum \nDivision)  and  titled  “Updated Procedures for Asylum Applications Filed by  Unaccompanied \nAlien  Children”  (Ex.  1).  Although  the  memorandum  is  dated  May  31,  2019,  USCIS  did  not \npublish  this  memorandum  on  its  website  until  June  14,  2019. \n73.  The  2019  Redetermination  Memo  acknowledges  that the  asylum  policy  in  place \nsince  2013  allowed  “asylum  officers  to  adopt  prior  UAC  determinations  made  by  U.S.  Customs \nand  Border  Protection  (CBP)  or  U.S.  Immigration  and  Customs  Enforcement  (ICE)  without \nfurther  factual  inquiry,  so  long  as  those  determinations  were  still  in  place  on  the  date  of filing  the \nasylum  application.”  Ex.  |  at  2. \n74.  Reversing  the  2013  policy,  the  2019  Redetermination  Memo  directs  that  all \nasylum  officers  must  “mak[e]  independent  factual  inquiries  in  all  cases  in  order to  determine \n17\nCase  8:19-cv-01944-GJH  Document1  Filed  07/01/19  Page  18  of  32 \nwhether the  individual  met the  UAC  definition  on  the  date  of first  filing  the  asylum  application” \nwhich  in  turn  determines  whether  USCIS  will  exercise jurisdiction,  and  “examine  whether  the \nindividual  was  a UAC  at the  time  of first  filing  for  the  purposes  of determining  whether  the  one- \nyear  filing  deadline  applies.”  /d. \n75.  Under  the  new  policy  set  forth  in  the  2019  Redetermination  Memo,  a UAC  who \nwas  previously  determined  to  be  a  UAC  and  who  applied  for  asylum  with  USCIS  after  turning \n18  or  reunifying  with  a parent  or  guardian  relying  on  existing  USCIS  policy  would  have  their \nasylum  application  rejected  by  USCIS  for  lack  of jurisdiction.  That  UAC  could  also  lose \neligibility  for  asylum  in  any  forum  due  to  the  retroactive  application  of the  one-year  bar  on \nfiling. \n76.  The  2019  Redetermination  Memo  states  that  its  “updated  procedures” 99  66 “apply  to \nany  USCIS  decision  issued  on  or  after  the  effective  date”  of the  memorandum  (emphasis  in \noriginal).  /d.  at  1.  The  2019  Redetermination  Memo  is  dated  May  31,  2019  and  therefore \npurports  to  take  effect  on  June  30,  2019,  which  is  30  calendar  days  from  the  date  of the \nmemorandum. \n77.  Under  the  2019  Redetermination  Memo,  an  individual  who  was  previously \ndetermined  to  be  a UAC,  and  who  applied  for  asylum  relying  on  the  procedures  set  forth  in  the \n2013  Kim  Memorandum,  could  arrive  at  an  asylum  interview  to  find  that  USCIS  will  decline \njurisdiction  because  the  asylum  officer  determined  the  applicant was  not  a  UAC  at the  time  of \napplication.  Indeed,  the  same  retroactive jurisdictional  denial  could  be  made  for  cases  that were \ninterviewed  years  ago  and  are  still  awaiting  decision.  In  those  and  other  postures,  if an  asylum \nofficer  determines  that,  at the  time  the  application  was  filed,  the  child  was  over  18  or  had  a \nparent  or  legal  guardian  in  the  United  States  who  the  asylum  officer  determines  was  “available  to \n18\nCase  8:19-cv-01944-GJH  Document1  Filed  07/01/19  Page  19  of  32 \nprovide  care  and  physical  custody,”  then  the  asvium  officer  must  decline jurisdiction.  For  those \nunaccompanied  children  in  removal  proceedings  who  applied  for  asylum  when  they  were  18  or \nolder  or  who  later  found  a  parent  or  guardian,  based  on  its  redetermination,  USCIS  will  refer the \nchildren’s  asylum  claims  to  the  Immigration  Court where  they  will  await  an  adversarial  process. \nMoreover,  as  the  CIS  Ombudsman  noted  with  reference  to  the  initial  2009  policy,  any  record \nmade  in  the  USCIS  interview  1s  then  transmitted to  ICE,  where  it  can  be  used  to  cross-examine \nthe  applicant  in  the  adversarial  immigration  process.  The  UAC  applicant  has  no  opportunity  to \nchallenge  those  USCIS  notes,  taken  in  the  course  of a process  USCIS  now  claims  not to  have \njurisdiction  to  conduct \n78.  There  are  marry  reasons  an  unaccompanied  child  may  have  filed  for  asylum  after \none  year,  after  turning  L8,  or  after  a  parent  or  legal  guardian  in  the  United  States  became  able  to \ntake  custody  of the  child. \n79.  As  Congress  recognized  im  passing  the  TVPRA,  children  are  particularly  unable \nto  access  complex  immigration  systems  without the  aid  of a  legal  representative,  and  nt  could \ntake  a  child  a  substantial  period  of time  to  find  legal  representation——if she  ever  docs.  The \nTYPRA’s  procedural  protections  allow  a  child  additional  time  to  find  legal  representation  and \naccess  the  asylum  process.  Many  unaccompanied  children,  including  one  or  more  of Plaintiffs, \nfind  legal  representation  after  turning  18  or  more  than  one  year  after  entry,  and  subsequently  file \nfor  asylum  before  USCIS. \n80.  Other  children  may  find  legal  representation,  but  then  pursue  a form  of \nunmigration  relief or  protection  other than  asylum  first,  knowing  that that the  TVPRA  asylum \nprocess  remains  available.  For  example,  many  unaccompanied  children  suffered  neglect, \nabandonment,  or  abuse  by  a  parent  that  qualifies  them  for  special  immigrant juvenile  status\nCase  8:19-cv-01944-GJH  Document1  Filed  07/01/19  Page  20  of  32 \nbroadened  by  the  TVPRA—or  qualify  for  forms  of relief such  as  T  and  U  visas  for  victims  of \ntrafficking  and  other  crimes.  For  many  reasons,  including  speed  of processing,  ability  to  avoid \nrevisiting  trauma,  and  availability  of visas,  a  UAC  and  his  or  her  legal  representative  may  decide \nto  pursue  SIS  or  another  form  of potential  relief prior  to  filmg  for  asylum  before  USCIS. \nBi.  In  applying  for  one  of these  other  forms  of relief since  2013,  a  child  applicant \ncould  rely  on  the  opportuntty  to  later  file  for  asylum  before  USCIS,  exempt  from  the  one-year \nfiling  deadline  and  still  be  entitled  to  the  child-appropriate  non-adversarial  interview  process  in \nthe  first  instance.  Then,  under the  system  Congress  created,  if the  child  were  unsuccessful  in  the \nUSCIS  process,  she  would  have  the  case  referred  back  to  immigration  court,  where  she  could \nagain  present  her  asylum  evidence  to  the  immigration judge  in  an  adversarial  procedure. \n82.  USCIS  has  during  a period  of many  months  delayed  scheduling  asylum \ninterviews  for  unaccompanied  child  applicants,  preventing  them  from  securing  relief under the \nestablished  policy.  Upon  information  and  belief,  USCIS  delayed  scheduling  interviews  in \nanticipation  of the  pronouncement  of a  new  policy.  Further,  USCIS  may  have  delayed \ninterviews  and  adjudications  in  anticipation  of an  effective  date  such  as  that  of the  2019 \nRedetermination  Memo,  with  the  effect  of applying  the  policy  retroactively  to  bar  otherwise \nqualified  children  from  benefitting  from  the  protections  of the  TVPRA. \n&3.  USCIS  asserts  in  the  2019  Redetermmation  Memo  that  USCIS  has  adopted  the \nnew  asylum  policy  in  order  to  bring  USCES  practice  in  line  with  a precedential  Board  of \nimmigration  Appeals  (BEA”)  decision  regarding jurisdiction  over  asylum  applications. \nAccording  to  USCIS,  the  new  rule  is  necessary  “[tlo  ensure  USCIS  is  making  these jurisdictional \n20\nCase  8:19-cv-01944-GJH  Document1  Filed  07/01/19  Page  21  of  32 \ndeterminations  ima  manner  consistent with  lbmmiugration  fudge  determinations  on  the  same \nissue.”  Ex.  £  at  2. \n84.  The  BIA  decision  referenced  in  the  2019  Redetermination  Memorandum,  Matter \nof M-A-C-O-,  27  1.  &  N.  Dec.  477  (BIA  2018),  does  not  divest  USCIS  of its  authority  to \ndetermine  whether  it  has jurisdiction  over  an  asylum  application.  Indeed,  USCIS  recognized  this \nin  the  2019  Redetermination  Memo,  stating  “both  the  Immigration  Judge  and  USCTS  have \nauthority  to  make  this jurisdictional  determimation.”  Ex.  1  at  2.  USCIS  also  recognized  in  its \nMay  20,  2019  report that  the  Mfatter  of M-A-C-O-  decision  “does  not  address  USCIS \ndeterminations  about  its  own jurisdiction.  USCIS  continues  to  make  its jurisdictional \ndeterminations  under  its  own  procedures.”  Ex.  7  at  3. \n85.  The  BIA  decision  does  not  mandate  any  changes  to  USCIS  policy.  It  does  not \ninvalidate  the  asylum  policy  set  forth  in  the  2013  Kim  Memorandum  or  direct  USCIS  to \nimplement  new  procedures.  And  it  only  addresses  the  question  of UAC  applicants  over  the  age \nof  18  at  time  of filing,  not  the  other  elements  of the  UAC  statutory  definition. \n86.  Neither  the  BIA  decision  nor  the  2019  Redetermination  Memo  undertakes  any \nexamination  of the  reasons  USCIS  adopted  the  asylum  policy  set  forth  m  the  2013  Kim \nMemorandum.  Nor  do  they  consider  any  of the  legislative  history  or  Congressional  intent  in \nenacting  the  TVPRA, \n87.  The  2019  Memorandum  is  a  final  agency  action  under  5  U.S.C.  §  704.  The  action \n“mark{s|  the  “consummation’  of the  agency’s  decisionmaking  process”  and  it  is  not  “of a merely \ntentative  or  interlocutory  nature.”  Bennett vy.  Spear,  520  U.S.  154,  178  (1997).  The \nmemorandum  marks  the  culmimation  of USCIS’s  process  for  setting  rules  governing  its \njurisdiction  and  legal  consequences  will  flow  from  it,  as  existing  asylum  applicants  will  lose  the \n2h\nCase  8:19-cv-01944-GJH  Document1  Filed  07/01/19  Page  22  of  32 \nright to  seek  relief from  the  asylum  office  and,  in  some  instances,  will  have  their  applications \ndenied  as  time  barred  unless  they  can  establish  an  exception  to  the  bar. \n88.  The  directives  in  the  2019  Redetermination  Memo  establish  a binding  norm  and \nleave  asylum  officers  with  no  discretion.  Specifically,  the  2019  Redetermination  Memo  states, \n“The  asylum  officer  must  evaluate  whether  the  asylum  application  was  filed  by  a UAC  by \nmaking  an  independent  factual  inquiry  as  to  whether  the  individual  met the  UAC  definition  at the \ntime  of first  filing  the  asylum  application.”  Ex.  |  at  3  (emphasis  added). \n89.  The  2019  Redetermination  Memo  imposes  new  legal  burdens  on  and  alters  the \nlegal  rights  and  interests  of asylum  seekers  who  have  previously  been  determined  to  be  UACs. \nSpecifically,  the  2019  Redetermination  Memo  provides,  “As  the  party  invoking  USCIS \njurisdiction,  the  individual  filing  for  asylum  bears  the  burden to  establish  that  he  or  she  met the \nUAC  definition,  which  includes  the  applicant’s  burden  to  establish  his  or  her  age,  and  that the \napplicant was  unaccompanied,  at the  time  of first  filing  the  asylum  application.”  Jd. \n90.  | Defendants  did  not  undertake  notice-and-comment  rulemaking  prior  to  issuing  the \n2019  Redetermination  Memo. \n91.  The  policy  announced  in  the  2019  Redetermination  Memo  sets  forth  legislative \nrules  and  is  thus  not  exempt  from  the  APA’s  requirements  of notice  and  comment.  The  2019 \nRedetermination  Memo  reflects  a  legislative  policy judgment,  not  merely  interpretative \nguidance. \nDefendants’  Failure  to  Promulgate  Regulations  Despite  the  TVPRA’s  Mandate  to  Do  So \n92.  The  TVPRA  expressly  directs  USCIS  to  promulgate  regulations  governing  the \nhandling  of asylum  claims  by  UACs:  “Applications  for  asylum  and  other  forms  of relief from \nremoval  in  which  an  unaccompanied  alien  child  is  the  principal  applicant  shall  be  governed  by \n22\nCase  8:19-cv-01944-GJH  Document1  Filed  07/01/19  Page  23  of  32 \nregulations  which  take  into  account  the  specialized  needs  of unaccompanied  alien  children  and \nwhich  address  both  procedural  and  substantive  aspects  of handling  unaccompanied  children’s \ncases.”  TVPRA  §  235(d)(8);  8  U.S.C.  §  1232(d)(8). \n93.  In  the  fall  of 2011,  DHS  and  USCIS  included  in  the  Unified  Agenda  a  proposed \nrule  titled  “Application  of the  William  Wilberforce  Trafficking  Victims  Protection \nReauthorization  Act  of 2008  to  Unaccompanied  Alien  Children  Seeking  Asylum.”  RIN  1615- \nAB96.’  The  notice  indicated  that the  proposed  “rule  implements  the  provisions  of the  TVPRA” \nand  acknowledged  that  “[t]he  TVPRA  mandated  promulgation  of regulations  taking  into  account \nthe  specialized  needs  of unaccompanied  alien  children  and  addressing  both  procedural  and \nsubstantive  aspects  of handling  unaccompanied  children’s  cases.”  The  agencies  did  not  publish \nthe  text  of the  proposed  rule. \n94.  DHS  and  USCIS  included  the  same  notice  in  the  Unified  Agenda  again  in  2012, \nSpring  2013,  Fall  2013,  Spring  2014,  Fall  2014,  Spring  2015,  Fall  2015,  Spring  2016,  Fall  2016, \nSpring  2017,  Fall  2017,  Spring  2018,  and  Fall  2018.  Yet  in  the  almost  eight  years  since  first \nincluding  this  notice  in  the  Unified  Agenda,  the  agencies  have  not  published  a Notice  of \nProposed  Rulemaking,  and  have  made  no  progress  toward  promulgating  regulations \nimplementing  the  UAC  provisions  of the  TVPRA. \nPlaintiffs  Relied  on  USCIS’s  2013  Policy  and  the  TVPRA  and  Will  Be  Deprived  of \nTheir  Right  to  Seek  Asylum  Before  USCIS  Under  the  New  Policy  and  Will  Be \nSeverely  Harmed \n95.  Plaintiff M.E.R.E.  entered  the  United  States  when  he  was  15  years  old.  Upon \napprehension,  he  was  determined  by  DHS  to  be  a UAC. \n96.  — In  reliance  on  the  2013  policy,  M.E.R.E.  first  sought  other  forms  of protection \nfrom  removal,  ultimately  applying  for  asylum  in  March  2018  after  reaching  the  age  of  18. \n  \n7 Available  at  https://reginfo.zov/public/do/eAgenda ViewRule?pubId=201110&RIN=1615-AB96. \n23 \nCase  8:19-cv-01944-GJH  Document1  Filed  07/01/19  Page  24  of  32 \nAlmost  1S  months  later,  M.EJR.E.  has  not  had  an  interview  scheduled  and  his  asylum  application \nis  stil  pending. \n97.  Under  the  new  policy  set  forth  the  in  2019  Redetermination  Memo,  USCIS  will \ndecline jurisdiction  over  M.E.R.E.’s  asylum  application  because  he  filed  after  turnmeg  1&8. \nMLELRLE.  will  lose  the  protections  associated  with  USCIS jurisdiction  over  his  asylum \napplication  and  instead  will  be  subject to  an  adversarial  process  in  immigration  Court  where  he \nwill  be  cross-examined  about the  abuse  and  persecution  he  suffered  as  a  child.  This  will  further \ndelay  the  already  extended  period  of time  M.E.R.E.  has  waited  for  his  asylum  application  to  be \ndecided.  The  added  delay  will  continue  to  prevent  M.E.R.E.  from  pursuing  his  education. \nO8,  Because  of the  new  policy  set  forth  the  im  2019  Redetermination  Memo,  the \ngovernment  may  conclude  that  M.E.R.E.  is  ineligible  for  asylum  since  he  filed  his  application \nmore  than  one  year  afier  entering  the  United  States. \nOO,   PlamtHf M.A.L.C.  entered  the  United  States  when  he  was  17  years  old.  Upon \napprehension,  he  was  determined  by  DHS  to  be  a  UAC. \n106.  In  reliance  on  the  2013  policy,  M.A.L.C.  applied  for  asylum  in  February  2018, \nwhen  he  was  19  years  oid.  Over  16  months  later,  USCIS  has  not  interviewed  M.A.L.C.  and  his \nasylum  application  is  still  pending. \n101.  Under  the  new  policy  set  forth  the  in  2019  Redetermination  Memo,  USCIS  will \ndecline jurisdiction  over  M.A.L.C.’s  asvlum  application  because  he  filed  after  turning  IS. \nM.A.L.C.  will  lose  the  protections  associated  with  USCIS jurisdiction  over  his  asylum \napplication  and  instead  will  be  subject to  an  adversarial  process  in  immigration  Court  where  he \nwill  be  cross-examined  about the  abuse  and  persecution  he  suffered  as  a  child.  This  will  further \n24\nCase  8:19-cv-01944-GJH  Document1  Filed  07/01/19  Page  25  of  32 \ndelay  the  already  extended  period  of tyme  M.A.L.C.  has  waited  for  his  asylum  application  to  be \ndecided. \n102.  Further,  M.A.L.C.  may  be  deemed  ineligible  for  asylum  at  all  because  his \napplication  was  filed  more  than  one  year  after  he  entered  the  United  States. \n103.  Plaintiff  K.A.R.C.  entered  the  United  States  when  he  was  17  years  old.  Upon \napprehension,  he  was  determined  by  DHS  to  be  a  UAC. \n104.  In  reliance  on  the  2013  policy,  KLA.R.C.  applied  for  asylum im  the  fall  of 2017, \nwhen  he  was  18  years  old.  K.A.R.C.  had  an  asylum  interview  in  November  2017.  Over  19 \nmonths  later,  K.A.R.C.  has  not  received  a  decision  on  his  asylum  application. \n108.  Under  the  new  rules  set  forth  in  the  2019  Redetermination  Memo,  USCIS  will \ndecline jurisdiction  over  K.A.R.C.’s  asylum  application  because  he  filed  after  turning  18. \nK.A.R.C.  will  lose  the  protections  associated  with  USCIS jurisdiction  over  his  asylum \napplication  and  mstead  will  be  subject to  an  adversarial  process  in  Immigration  Court where  he \nwill  be  cross-examined  about  the  physical  abuse  he  suffered  at  the  hands  of his  father  and  brother \nand  the  rape  and  threats  of physical  violence  by  gang  members.  This  will  further  delay  the \nalready  extended  period  of time  K.A.R.C.  has  watted  for  his  asylum  application  to  be  decided. \nThe  added  delay  will  prevent  K.A.R.C.  from  pursuing  a  college  education. \n106.  Further,  K.A.R.C.  may  be  deemed  ineligible  for  asylum  at  all  because  his \napplication  was  filed  more  than  one  year  after  he  entered  the  United  States. \n[07.  Plaintiff JOP.  entered  the  United  States  when  he  was  [5  years  old.  Upon \napprehension,  DHS  determined  him  to  be  a UAC.\nCase  8:19-cv-01944-GJH  Document1  Filed  07/01/19  Page  26  of  32 \n108.   Inreliance  on  the  2013  policy,  J.O.P.  applied  for  asylum  in  February  2018,  still \nunder the  age  of  18,  but  after  being  reunited  with  his  mother  in  the  United  States.  J.O.P.  has  not \nbeen  scheduled  for  an  asylum  interview. \n109.  Under  the  new  policy  set  forth  the  in  2019  Redetermination  Memo,  USCIS  will \ndecline jurisdiction  over  J.O.P.’s  asylum  application  because  he  filed  after  reuniting  with  his \nmother.  J.O.P.  will  lose  the  protections  associated  with  USCIS jurisdiction  over  his  asylum \napplication  and  instead  will  be  subject to  an  adversarial  process  in  Immigration  Court where  he \nwill  be  cross-examined  about the  murder  he  witnessed  and  threats  he  received  in  his  home \ncountry.  This  will  further  delay  the  already  extended  period  of time  J.O.P.  has  waited  for  his \nasylum  application  to  be  decided. \nCLASS  ALLEGATIONS \n110.  Plaintiffs  incorporate  by  reference  the  preceding  allegations  of this  Complaint. \n111.  Plaintiffs  bring  this  action  under  Federal  Rule  of Civil  Procedure  23(b)(2)  on \nbehalf of themselves  and  a nationwide  class  of all  other  persons  similarly  situated. \n112.  Plaintiffs  seek to  represent the  following  nationwide  class: \nAll  individuals  nationwide  who  (1)  were  determined  to  be  an  Unaccompanied  Alien \nChild  before  June  30,  2019;  and  (2)  who  had  filed  an  asylum  application  that was \npending  with  United  States  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Services  (“USCIS”)  as  of June \n30,  2019;  and  (3)  on  the  date  they  filed  their  asylum  application  with  USCIS,  were  18 \nyears  of age  or  older,  or  had  a  parent  or  legal  guardian  in  the  United  States  who  is \navailable  to  provide  care  and  physical  custody;  and  (4)  as  of June  30,  2019,  USCIS  has \nnot  adjudicated  the  individual’s  asylum  application. \n113.  Plaintiffs  are  each  adequate  representatives  of the  proposed  class. \n114.  The  proposed  class  satisfies  the  requirements  of Rule  23(a)(1)  because  the  class  is \nso  numerous  that joinder  of all  members  is  impracticable. \n26\nCase  8:19-cv-01944-GJH  Document1  Filed  07/01/19  Page  27  of  32 \n115.  On  information  and  belief,  there  are  thousands  of individuals  who  fit  within  the \nclass. \n116.  The  class  meets  the  commonality  requirements  of Rule  23(a)(2).  The  members  of \nthe  class  are  all  subject to  the  2019  Redetermination  Memo  and will  lose  their  right to  proceed \nbefore  USCIS  on  the  basis  of the  new  policy.  This  lawsuit  raises  questions  of law  common  to  all \nmembers  of the  class,  including  whether  Defendants  have  violated  the  class  members’  due \nprocess  rights;  whether  the  2019  Redetermination  Memo  is  arbitrary  and  capricious  under  the \nAPA;  and  whether  the  2019  Redetermination  Memo  is  unlawful  because  it was  not  promulgated \npursuant to  notice-and-comment  as  required  by  the  APA. \n117.  The  proposed  class  meets  the  typicality  requirements  of Rule  23(a)(3),  because \nthe  claims  of the  representative  Plaintiffs  are  typical  of the  claims  of the  class.  Plaintiffs  and  the \nproposed  class  share  the  same  legal  claims,  which  assert the  same  substantive  and  procedural \nrights  under  the  due  process  clause,  the  APA,  and  the  TVPRA. \n118.  The  proposed  class  meets  the  adequacy  requirements  of Rule  23(a)(4).  The \nrepresentative  Plaintiffs  seek the  same  relief as  other  members  of the  class  and  have  identical \ninterests  to  the  class  members  in  vigorously  pursuing  that  relief.  In  defending  their  own  rights, \nPlaintiffs  will  defend  the  rights  of all  proposed  class  members  fairly  and  adequately. \n119.  The  proposed  class  also  satisfied  Federal  Rule  of Civil  Procedure  23(b)(2). \nDefendants  have  acted  on  grounds  that  are  generally  applicable  to  each  class  member.  Injunctive \nand  declaratory  relief is  thus  appropriate  with  respect to  the  class  as  a whole. \nCOUNTI \n(Administrative  Procedure  Act — Arbitrary,  Capricious,  or  Otherwise  Not  in  Accordance \nWith  Law) \n120.  Plaintiffs  incorporate  by  reference  the  preceding  allegations  of this  Complaint. \n27\nCase  8:19-cv-01944-GJH  Document1  Filed  07/01/19  Page  28  of  32 \n121.  Title  3,  U.S.  Code  8  706(2)  authorizes  a  court  to  hold  unlawful  and  set  aside  final \nagency  action  found  to  be  arbitrary,  capricious,  an  abuse  of discretion  (e.g.,  irrational),  or \notherwise  not  in  accordance  with  law,  or  m  excess  of statutory jurisdiction  or  authority. \n122.  ‘The  asylum  policy  set  forth  in  the  2019  Redetermmation  Memo  is  arbitrary, \ncapricious,  an  abuse  of discretion,  not  in  accordance  law,  and  is  inconsistent  with  the  TVPRA, \nand  therefore  in  violation  of 5  ULS.C.  §  706(2). \n123.  The  2019  Redetermination  Memo  violates  the  TVPRA  because  the  asylum  rules \nset  forth  therein  are  contrary  to  its  plain  language.  The  2019  Redetermination  Memo  mandates \nthat  all  asylum  officers  must  evaluate,  in  all  cases,  whether  an  applicant  met  the  statutory \ndefinition  of a UAC  at the  time  of filing  the  asylurn  application.  This  mandate  applies  in  all \ncases,  even  where  an  indevidual  had  previously  been  determimed  to  be  a  UAC.  These  mandates \nare  contrary  to  the  structure  and  text  of the  TVPRA,  which  plainly  establish  that  a  child’s  UAC \nStatus  determination  occurs  upon  the  child’s  initial  contact  with  a  federal  government  department \nor  agency  and  is  not  subject  to  redetermination  by  USCIS. \n124,  The  2019  Redetermination  Memo  is  arbitrary  and  capricious  because,  for \nexample,  it  does  not  address,  nor  acknowledge,  any  of the  reasons  for  adopting  the  asylum  policy \nin  place  since  2013  for  UACs  seeking  asylum  before  USCIS.  Defendants  have  failed  to  provide \nany  explanation,  much  fess  a  reasoned  explanation,  of how  the  2019  Redetermination  Memo \naddresses  the  issues  leading  to  the  adoption  of the  2013  Memorandum,  or  why  consistency  with \nBoard  of Immigration  Appeals  precedent  relates  to  whether  a  UAC  has  subsequently  been \nreunited  with  a  parent  or  assigned  a  legal  guardian. \n28\nCase  8:19-cv-01944-GJH  Document1  Filed  07/01/19  Page  29  of  32 \n125.  The  2019  Redetermination  Memo  1s  also  arbitrary  and  capricious  because  it  fails \nto  consider  the  reliance  interests  of children,  including  Plaintiffs,  with  pending  asylum \napplications  who  had  relied  in  good  faith  on  the  asylum  policy  in  place  since  2013. \nCOUNT IT \n(Violation  of Due  Process) \n126.  Plaintiffs  incorporate  by  reference  the  preceding  allegations  of this  Complaint. \n127.  Defendants  violate  Plaintiffs’  Due  Process  rights  by  retroactively  applying  the \nasylum  rules  set  forth  in  the  2019  Redetermination  Memo.  Plaintiffs  filed  for  asylum  reasonably \nexpecting  to  benefit  from  all  the  protections  and  rights  accorded  by  the  TVPRA  to  UACs,  as \noutlined  by  the  2013  Kim  Memorandum.  Yet the  2019  Redetermination  Memo  will  actually \npenalize  the  Plaintiffs’  past  conduct taken  in  reliance  on  USCIS  policy  in  place  since  2013. \n128.  The  asylum  policy  set  forth  in the  2019  Redetermination  Memo  changes  the  legal \nlandscape  for  child  asylum  applicants  by  radically  rewriting  the  terms  under  which  applicants \nlike  the  Plaintiffs,  who  have  been  determined  to  be  UACs,  can  seek  asylum.  Pursuant to  the \nasylum  policy  promulgated  by  the  2013  Kim  Memorandum,  USCIS  had  initial jurisdiction  over \neach  of Plaintiffs’  asylum  applications  based  on  DHS’s  prior  determination  that  each  Plaintiff \nwas  aUAC.  Without  any  meaningful  notice  to  the  public,  USCIS  has  changed  the  rules  and \nstated  unequivocally  that  it will  apply  its  new jurisdictional  requirements  even  to  applications \nthat  were  pending  with  the  agency  before  the  new  policy’s  effective  date.  Application  of the \nnew  asylum  policy  will  prevent  USCIS  from  hearing  the  Plaintiffs’  asylum  claims,  thereby \ndepriving  them  of the  protections  Congress  provided  for  UACs  in  the  TVPRA.  By  subjecting \nPlaintiffs  to  a  one-year  bar  on  filing  an  asylum  applications,  application  of the  new  asylum \npolicy  will  render  Plaintiffs  completely  ineligible  for  asylum  unless  they  are  able  to  carry  the \nburden  of establishing  one  of two  narrow  exceptions  to  the  bar  in  immigration  court. \n29\nCase  8:19-cv-01944-GJH  Document1  Filed  07/01/19  Page  30  of  32 \n129.  The  2019  Redetermination  Memorandum  violates  the  procedural  protections  of \nthe  Fifth  Amendments’  Due  Process  Clause.  The  2019  Redetermination  Memorandum  1s \ntherefore  “contrary  to  constitutional  right,  power,  privilege,  or  immunity”  and  invalid  under  5 \nU.S.C.  §  706(2)(B). \nCOUNT HI \n(Failure  to  Follow  APA  Procedure) \n130.  Plaintiffs  incorporate  by  reference  the  preceding  allegations  of this  Complaint. \n131.  Under  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act,  an  agency  must  provide  “[g]eneral \nnotice  of proposed  rulemaking...  published  in  the  Federal  Register”  whenever  the  agency  seeks \nto  promulgate  arule.  5  U.S.C.  §  553(b).  Exempt  from  this  requirement  are  “interpretive  rules, \ngeneral  statements  of policy,  or  rules  of agency  organization,  procedure,  or  practice.”  /d.  After \nthe  agency  has  published  the  required  notice,  “the  agency  shall  give  interested  persons  an \nopportunity  to  participate  in  the  rule  making  through  submission  of written  data,  views,  or \narguments.”  Id.  §  553(c). \n132.  Defendants  did  not  provide  notice  of proposed  rulemaking,  nor  did  they  invite \ncomments  from  interested  persons  before  issuing  the  2019  Redetermination  Memo. \n133.  None  of the  statutory  exceptions  to  the  requirement  of notice-and-comment \nrulemaking  is  applicable  here.  See  5  U.S.C.  §  553(b). \n134.  The  asylum  rules  set  forth  in  the  2019  Redetermination  Memo  are  legislative \nrules,  not  interpretive  rules,  because,  for  example,  they  effect  a  substantive  change  in  existing \nlaw. \n135.  The  2019  Redetermination  Memo  is  not  a  statement  of policy  that  is  exempt  from \npublic  notice,  including  because  it  establishes  binding  rules  on  all  asylum  officers  without \nleaving  room  for  any  exercise  of discretion. \n30\nCase  8:19-cv-01944-GJH  Document1  Filed  07/01/19  Page  31  of  32 \n136.  The  asylum  policy  set  forth  in  the  2019  Redetermination  Memo  does  not \nconstitute  rules  of agency  organization,  procedure,  or  practice. \n137.  The  May  2019  Policy  Memorandum  was  issued  “without  observance  of procedure \nrequired  by  law”  and  is  invalid  under  5  U.S.C.  §  706(2)(D). \nPRAYER  FOR  RELIEF \nFor  the  foregoing  reasons,  Plaintiffs  request that the  Court: \na)  declare  that the  2019  Redetermination  Memorandum  is  unlawful; \nb)  vacate  the  2019  Redetermination  Memorandum; \nCc)  enjoin  Defendants  from  enforcing  or  applying  any  aspect  of the  2019 \nRedetermination  Memorandum; \nd)  enjoin  Defendants  from  taking  adjudicatory  or  enforcement  action  against  Plaintiffs \nor  members  of the  proposed  class  during  the  pendency  of this  litigation; \ngrant  Plaintiffs  their  costs  in  this  action,  including  reasonable  attorneys’  fees  incurred \npursuant to  the  Equal  Access  to  Justice  Act,  28  U.S.C.  §  2412;  and \naward  other  relief that the  Court  deems just  and  proper. \n31\nCase  8:19-cv-01944-GJH  Document1  Filed  07/01/19  Page  32  of  32 \nDated:  July  1,  2019 \nScott  Shuchart* \nKids  in Need  of Defense \nRespectfully  submitted,  1201  L  Street,  NW,  Floor  2 \nWashington,  DC  20005 \n/s/Brian Burgess  Phone:  202-318-0595 \nFax:  202-824-0702 \nBrian Burgess  (Bar No.  19251)  sshuchart@supportkind.org \nStephen R.

BACKGROUND \nIn 2008, Congress enacted the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection \nReauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA or the Act). TVPRA, Pub. L. No. 110-457 § 235(d), 122 \nStat. 5044, 5074, codified at 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158, 1232(d). The Act extended legal protections to \nchildren who entered the United States without a parent or other legal guardian and were \ndetermined to be “unaccompanied alien children” (UACs). A UAC is a child who: \n(A) has no lawful immigration status in the United States; (B) has not attained 18 \nyears of age; and (C) with respect to whom—(i) there is no parent or legal \nguardian in the United States; or (ii) no parent or legal guardian in the United \nStates is available to provide care and physical custody. \n \n6 U.S.C. § 279(g)(2). The TVPRA requires that after an unaccompanied child is discovered by \nfederal government officers (often U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) or U.S. \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers), she must be transferred to the custody of \nthe Office of Refugee Resettlement within the Department of Health and Human Services, \ntypically within a 72-hour period, for care and further screening. Unlike the agencies whose \nmission is to enforce immigration laws, the Department of Health and Human Services has social \nworkers trained to work with children. 8 U.S.C. § 1232(a)(3).  \nThe TVPRA also provides that USCIS, not an immigration court, has initial jurisdiction \nover a UAC’s asylum application. 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(3)(c). The USCIS asylum process is a less \nadversarial system more sensitive to the special needs of children who do not know how to \nnavigate an immigration system designed for adults, and who likely sought safety in the United \nStates without understanding their legal options. ECF No. 1 ¶ 5. Instead of having to be cross-\nexamined in an adversarial courtroom by trained government lawyers, unaccompanied children \nengage with USCIS officers trained to conduct non-adversarial interviews and to apply child-\n2 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 54   Filed 08/02/19   Page 3 of 16\nsensitive and trauma-informed interview techniques. Id. ¶¶ 11, 49. The TVPRA also directs \nUSCIS to help make counsel available to these children. 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5). Additionally, \nwhile asylum applicants generally must file their asylum applications within one year of entering \nthe United States, id. § 1158(a)(2)(B), the TVPRA exempts unaccompanied children from this \none-year filing deadline, id. § 1158(a)(2)(E). \nThe TVPRA delegates authority to federal agencies to enact “regulations which take into \naccount the specialized needs of unaccompanied alien children and which address both \nprocedural and substantive aspects of handling unaccompanied alien children’s cases.” Id. § \n1232(d)(8). The Act neither directs USCIS to redetermine an individual’s UAC status at the time \nof an application for asylum when a federal agency has initially determined the child meets the \nUAC definition nor expressly prohibits the agency from making a redetermination at that time. \nSee id. §§ 1158, 1232. Similarly, the TRVPA neither expressly authorizes nor expressly prohibits \nUSCIS from rescinding an earlier UAC determination. Id. However, in a memorandum authored \nby Asylum Chief Ted Kim in May 2013 (Kim Memo), USCIS implemented a policy of \naccepting jurisdiction of asylum applications filed by individuals previously determined to be \nUACs without having asylum officers make redeterminations regarding the children’s status. \nECF No. 15-6.  \nThe Kim Memo came shortly after a 2012 report by the Citizenship and Immigration \nServices Ombudsman recommended that USCIS implement the policy of not rescinding UAC \ndeterminations. ECF No. 15-5. In an independent analysis of problems encountered by \nunaccompanied children seeking asylum in the United States, the Ombudsman started from the \nunderstanding that when a child is placed in removal proceedings, the apprehending entity, \n3 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 54   Filed 08/02/19   Page 4 of 16\nwhether ICE or CBP “must make a finding that the child is unaccompanied.” Id. at 7.2 Prior to \nthe 2012 Ombudsman Report, USCIS had been performing redeterminations of a child’s UAC \nstatus upon receipt of an asylum application and again during the asylum interview. Id. at 5–6. \nThe Ombudsman outlined several problems with re-determining UAC status, including difficulty \nrescheduling UAC interviews, and inadequate methods and approaches to adjudication. Id. The \nOmbudsman was concerned that instead of “facilitating expedited, non-adversarial interviews \nenvisioned by Congress,” the USCIS policy of undertaking a redetermination of UAC status at \nevery asylum interview created “delay and confusion.” Id. at 6. \nIn the Ombudsman’s view, “TVPRA’s procedural and substantive protections were \ndesigned to remain available to UACs throughout removal proceedings, housing placement, and \nthe pursuit of any available relief,” and “[s]ubjecting a child seeking asylum to multiple UAC \ndeterminations as [was] required by USCIS’ temporary guidance appears at odds with the \nTVPRA’s express purpose, namely, to provide timely, appropriate relief for vulnerable \nchildren.” Id. Further, the Ombudsman acknowledged that “Congress did not provide language \nindicating that the filing of an asylum application should trigger a new or successive UAC \ndeterminations that could eliminate statutory protections or remove the UAC from [removal] \nproceedings.” Id. at 7. The Ombudsman concluded that “[e]liminating the practice of USCIS re-\ndetermining UAC status during the asylum interview would also restore a level of fairness that \ncomes from having a predictable and uniform process.” Id. at 8. \nUnder the policy adopted by the Kim Memo, which was consistent with the Ombudsman \nreport’s recommendations, asylum officers were required to accept determinations by CBP and \nICE regarding UAC status even if an individual had turned eighteen or been reunited with a \n                                                 \n2 Pin cites to documents filed on the Court’s electronic filing system (CM/ECF) refer to the page numbers generated \nby that system. \n4 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 54   Filed 08/02/19   Page 5 of 16\nparent or guardian by the time he applied for asylum. ECF No. 15-6 at 3. As recently as May 20, \n2019, USCIS confirmed that the asylum policy set forth in the 2013 Kim Memo remained in \neffect. ECF No. 15-8 at 4. But on June 14, 2019, USCIS published a memorandum on its website \nthat changed the rules for determining whether a child is eligible for TVPRA protections. ECF \nNo. 15-2. The 2019 Redetermination Memo is dated May 31 2019, but was not made available \non the USCIS website until June 14, 2019. Id.; ECF No. 1 ¶ 8. The policy set forth in the \nRedetermination Memo became effective on June 30, 2019. Id.  \nPursuant to the Redetermination Memo, all asylum officers are now required to “mak[e] \nindependent factual inquiries in all cases in order to determine whether the individual met the \nUAC definition on the date of first filing the asylum application.” ECF No. 15-2 at 3. The \nRedetermination Memo states that the “updated procedures” “apply to any USCIS decision \nissued on or after the effective date” of the memorandum. Id. at 2 (emphasis in original). Under \nthe new rules, an individual originally designated as a UAC who, perhaps relying on the former \npolicy, applied for asylum after reaching the age of eighteen or after being reunited with a parent \nor guardian, will arrive at an asylum interview to find that USCIS must now decline jurisdiction \nbecause of a redetermination that the applicant was not a UAC at the time he filed an application. \nSee id. Under the prior rule, individuals determined to be UACs by CBP or ICE had two \nopportunities to present their claims on the merits: first through the USCIS process and again, if \nnecessary, in an immigration court. ECF No. 1 ¶ 81. But under the new policy, some individuals \nwill no longer be eligible to participate in the first half of this process because by the time they \napplied for asylum they had attained the age of eighteen or had been reunited with a parent or \nguardian. Id. ¶ 9. Further, under the new rules, an individual who had previously been \ndetermined to be a UAC and who applied for asylum outside of the one-year filing deadline \n5 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 54   Filed 08/02/19   Page 6 of 16\ncould lose all right to asylum due to the imposition of the one-year bar from which he believed \nhe was exempt. Id. ¶ 81. \nAccording to a leaked internal memorandum from 2017, unknown members of the \nadministration considered rescinding the 2013 Kim Memo as one of a number of proposed \n“Policy Options to Respond to Border Surge of Illegal Immigration.” ECF No. 15-3 at 2. \nHowever, a comment on the memo, also by an unknown author, noted that “DOJ allows \nimmigration judges to make independent determinations as to when a minor is a UAC” and “it \nwould be good for DHS to have the same policy.” ECF No. 15-3 at 2. Consistent with this \ncomment, the Redetermination Memo explained that USCIS decided to change course from the \n2013 policy to ensure that the agency is making “jurisdictional determinations in a manner \nconsistent with Immigration Judge determinations.” ECF No. 15-2 at 3. Under Board of \nImmigration Appeals precedent, Immigration Judges also have initial jurisdiction over asylum \napplications filed by individuals previously determined to be UACs who have turned eighteen \nbefore filing their application. Id. (citing Matter of M-A-C-O-, 27 I&N Dec. 477 (BIA 2018)). \nThus, both USCIS and immigration judges have initial jurisdiction over UAC asylum \napplications. Id. However, where USCIS officers were not making redeterminations about \npreviously granted UAC status pursuant to the 2013 policy, immigration judges were making \nsuch redeterminations. Id. The new policy eliminated that distinction. \nThe Redetermination Memo did not address whether the facts and circumstances that \nunderlay the agency’s prior policy (and that were described in detail in the 2012 Ombudsmen’s \nreport) had changed. See id. The Redetermination Memo also did not address whether USCIS \nhad taken into account any interests of those individuals who had been relying on the prior policy \nto make decisions about when to file an asylum application. See id.   \n6 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 54   Filed 08/02/19   Page 7 of 16\nPlaintiffs came to the United States as children to escape violence, abuse, or persecution \nin their home countries. ECF No. 16 ¶¶ 2, 5, 6; ECF No. 18 ¶ 5; ECF No. 19 at 4; ECF No. 20 ¶ \n4. They each arrived in the United States as children without a parent or guardian to care for \nthem and the government determined them to be UACs. See ECF No. 1 ¶¶ 15–36. Since arriving \nin the United States, Plaintiffs have each either turned eighteen or been reunited with a parent or \nguardian. ECF No. 16 ¶¶ 8, 10; ECF No. 18 ¶¶ 5, 8; ECF No. 19 ¶ 5; ECF No. 20 ¶¶ 7, 9. \nHowever, because they were relying on USCIS’s former policy of not rescinding UAC status, \nPlaintiffs did not file asylum applications until after they had either been reunited with a parent \nor guardian or attained the age of eighteen. Id.   \nPlaintiffs filed a Complaint challenging the implementation of USCIS’s redetermination \npolicy as violating the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Due Process Clause of the \nFifth Amendment of the United State Constitution on July 1, 2019. ECF No. 1. On that date, they \nalso moved for a Temporary Restraining Order. ECF No. 14. The Court held a hearing on July \n19, 2019 at which both parties had an opportunity to be heard. ECF No. 43. At the hearing, \nDefendants conceded that Plaintiffs are entitled to at least a limited temporary restraining order \nordering Defendants to apply the policies outlined in the 2013 Kim Memo to the four named \nPlaintiffs and to avoid re-determining their UAC status.  \nII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW  \nPlaintiffs seek temporary injunctive relief prohibiting Defendants from implementing the \nMay 31, 2019 policy memo until the Court has an opportunity to consider the policy’s validity. \nThe purpose of a temporary restraining order (TRO) or a preliminary injunction is to “protect the \nstatus quo and to prevent irreparable harm during the pendency of a lawsuit, ultimately to \npreserve the court’s ability to render a meaningful judgment on the merits.” In re Microsoft \n7 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 54   Filed 08/02/19   Page 8 of 16\nCorp. Antitrust Litig., 333 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir. 2003). The substantive requirements for a \nTRO and a preliminary injunction are identical. See U.S. Dept. of Labor v. Wolf Run Mining Co., \nInc., 452 F.3d 275, 281 n. 1 (4th Cir. 2006). Specifically, parties moving for a TRO or \npreliminary injunction must show: (1) they are likely to succeed on the merits; (2) they will \nsuffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) the balance of equities tips in \ntheir favor; and (4) maintaining the status quo is in the public interest. Winter v. Natural \nResources Defense Council, 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008)). The final two factors generally “merge when \nthe Government is the opposing party.” Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). \nIII.  DISCUSSION \nPlaintiffs argue that the Redetermination Memo did not go through the required notice-\nand-comment procedure for agency rulemaking in violation of the APA, is inconsistent with the \nTVPRA, is arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA, and violates Plaintiffs’ due process \nrights. As described in more detail below, the Court finds that Plaintiffs and those similarly \nsituated to them are likely to succeed on their claim that the redetermination policy violates the \nAPA because the agency failed to go through required notice-and-comment procedures and \nfailed to consider reliance interests created by the 2013 Kim Memo. The Court also concludes \nthat Plaintiffs and those similarly situated to them are likely to experience irreparable harm if the \nredetermination policy is not enjoined and the balance of harms favors temporary injunctive \nrelief.  \nBecause the Defendants consent to the named Plaintiffs’ requested temporary relief as to \ntheir due process claims based on the issue of retroactive application of the policy to those \nPlaintiffs, the Court briefly addresses whether Plaintiffs’ request for a temporary restraining \norder is moot or whether Plaintiffs can still achieve broader injunctive relief. Given that the \n8 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 54   Filed 08/02/19   Page 9 of 16\nremedy Congress provides for unlawful agency action is setting aside that agency action, not \nsimply prohibiting the application of that action to individuals, Plaintiffs’ request for broader \ninjunctive relief still presents a live controversy. 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(2)(A)–(D); See also Guilford \nColl. v. McAleenan, No. 1:18cv891, — F.Supp.3d —, 2019 WL 1980132, at *11 (M.D.N.C. May \n3, 2019) (granting an injunction setting aside a different unlawful USCIS policy in its entirety \nbecause that injunction had the “breadth . . . necessary to give the prevailing parties the relief to \nwhich they are entitled.”) (quoting Bresgal v. Brock, 843 F.2d 1163, 1170–71 (9th Cir. 1987))). \nFurther, courts may enter class-wide injunctive relief before certification of a class. Rodriguez v. \nProvidence Community Corrections, 155 F. Supp. 3d 758, 766 (M.D. Tenn. 2015); Newberg on \nClass Actions § 4:30 (5th ed. 2013) (“[A] court may issue a preliminary injunction in class suits \nprior to a ruling on the merits.”); see also Mullins v. Cole, 218 F. Supp. 3d 488 (S.D.W. Va. \n2016) (considering harms to putative class as a whole in awarding preliminary injunction prior to \nclass certification).  \nBecause, as described below, the Court finds Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits \nof some of their APA claims—claims relevant to potential class members—Plaintiffs’ request for \na broader injunction than the relief consented to by Defendants is not moot. There remains a \ncontroversy regarding whether the redetermination policy should ultimately be set aside as \nviolating the APA—a remedy that would resolve not only the named Plaintiffs’ claims but also \nthe claims of those similarly situated who Plaintiffs seek to represent through a class action. In \nthis context, Plaintiffs’ request for preliminary injunctive relief beyond that consented to by \nDefendants is still proper. Having resolved these threshold concerns, the Court turns to \nPlaintiffs’ likelihood of success on their specific claims.  \n \n9 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 54   Filed 08/02/19   Page 10 of 16\nA.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits  \n \ni.  Notice and Comment \n \nPlaintiffs are likely to succeed on the claim that USCIS failed to engage in the required \nnotice-and-comment procedure for rulemaking. Under the APA, legislative rules must go \nthrough notice-and-comment rulemaking before they become effective. See 5 U.S.C. § 553(a)–\n(c); Children’s Hosp. of the King’s Daughters, Inc. v. Azar, 896 F.3d 615, 619–20 (4th Cir. \n2018). This requirement does not apply to interpretive rules. Children’s Hosp, 896 F.3d at 620.  \nA rule is “legislative,” rather than “interpretive,” if it “effects a substantive change in existing \nlaw or policy.” Id.  When a rule affects “individual rights and obligations” it is “a substantive \nrule—or a ‘legislative-type rule.’” Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 302 (1979) (internal \ncitation omitted) (quoting Morton v. Ruiz, 415 U.S. 199, 232, 236 (1974)). Additionally, \nlegislative rules “are rules issued by agencies pursuant to statutory authority and which \nimplement the statute.” Chen Zhou Chai v. Carroll, 48 F.3d 1331, 1340 (4th Cir. 1995). Because \nthe new policy did not go through a notice-and-comment procedure, the question for the Court is \nwhether it is a legislative or interpretive rule.  \nPlaintiffs are likely to succeed in demonstrating that the redetermination policy is \nlegislative in nature because the policy is inconsistent with prior agency policy, thus affecting a \n“substantive change in existing law or policy.” Children’s Hosp, 896 F.3d at 620.  Pursuant to \nthe new policy, which is binding on “any USCIS decision” regarding jurisdiction over an asylum \ncase, ECF No. 15-2 at 2 (emphasis in original), USCIS officers must now determine whether an \nindividual met the UAC definition on the date the individual filed an asylum application rather \nthan adopting the UAC status determination made by another federal agency.  Thus, under the \nnew policy, if Plaintiffs or similar individuals wanted USCIS to accept jurisdiction over their \n10 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 54   Filed 08/02/19   Page 11 of 16\nasylum applications, they were obligated to file those applications before they attained the age of \neighteen or before they were reunited with a parent or guardian. Additionally, the new policy \nretroactively affects the rights of Plaintiffs and those similarly situated to Plaintiffs by taking \naway their exemption to the one-year filing deadline, meaning some will lose their opportunity to \nseek asylum.  \nBeyond the ways in which the redetermination policy affects substantive rights and \nobligations, the rule is also legislative in nature because USCIS issued it pursuant to the agency’s \nstatutory authority under the TVPRA to implement the Act. Chen Zhou Chai, 48 F.3d at 1340 \n(legislative rules “are rules issued by agencies pursuant to statutory authority and which \nimplement the statute.”). When Congress directs an agency to implement key statutory \nprovisions through regulation, courts “should lean toward finding” that an agency’s attempt to \nexercise delegated policymaking responsibility under the statute “requires notice and comment.” \nN.H. Hosp. Ass’n v. Azar, 887 F.3d 62, 71 (1st Cir. 2018). That is the situation here where \nCongress has delegated authority through the TVPRA to USCIS to enact “regulations which take \ninto account the specialized needs of unaccompanied alien children and which address both \nprocedural and substantive aspects of handling unaccompanied alien children’s cases.” 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1232(d)(8). The Redetermination Memo skirts this instruction from Congress that USCIS issue \nregulations to implement procedures related to UAC’s asylum applications.3  \nIn sum, even though the redetermination policy is likely a legislative rule, Defendants did \nnot engage in the notice-and-comment process, which would violate the APA.  \n \n \n                                                 \n3 The fact that the Kim Memo did not go through notice-and-comment does not impact whether the policy should \nhave since the Kim Memo was not challenged on this basis. \n11 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 54   Filed 08/02/19   Page 12 of 16\nii.  Arbitrary and Capricious Review  \n \nPlaintiffs are also likely to succeed on their claim that the redetermination policy is \narbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA because the USCIS failed to consider serious \nreliance interests engendered by the agency’s longstanding prior policy. The APA “sets forth the \nprocedures by which federal agencies are accountable to the public and their actions subject to \nreview by the courts.” Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 796 (1922). Section 706(2) \nprovides that, in a suit challenging agency action, “[t]he reviewing court shall . . . hold unlawful \nand set aside agency action” found to be “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \notherwise not in accordance with law; contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or \nimmunity; in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right; \n[or] without observance of procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(2)(A)–(D). Section \n706(2) review is to be “thorough, probing, [and] in-depth.” Citizens to Pres. Overton Park, Inc. \nv. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 415 (1971); see id. at 416.  \nAgency action is arbitrary and capricious “if the agency has relied on factors which \nCongress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the \nproblem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the \nagency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of \nagency expertise.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm, 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).  While \nagencies may change their policies, they must provide “a reasoned explanation” for the shift. \nFCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515–16 (2009). Moreover, the agency must \n“provide a reasoned explanation” for a change in instances where the agency’s “prior policy has \nengendered serious reliance interests that must be taken into account.” Id. at 515–16. In other \nwords, while an agency is free to change its policies, it must address the “facts and circumstances \n12 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 54   Filed 08/02/19   Page 13 of 16\nthat underlay or were engendered by the prior policy.” Id. at 516.  If an agency ignores such \nreliance interests it may have “entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,” \nrendering the agency’s action arbitrary and capricious. See id.; State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43.  \nHere, Defendants entirely failed to consider reliance interests in the decision \nmemorandum outlining the agency’s new policy. See ECF No. 15-2. While USCIS may be \njustified in changing course to create consistency between the jurisdictional determinations made \nby USCIS and immigration judges, id. at 3, it needs to at least provide a “reasoned explanation” \nfor why it is disregarding the facts that underlay the earlier policy as well as the serious reliance \ninterests engendered by the prior rules. Given the agency’s failure to do so, Plaintiffs are likely to \nsucceed on their claim that the redetermination policy is arbitrary and capricious in violation of \nthe APA.  \niii.  TVPRA  \n \nWhile Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on some of their claims, the Court is not convinced \nthat Plaintiffs remaining claims will be meritorious. Plaintiffs’ argument that the USCIS acted in \nexcess of statutory authority because the redetermination policy is inconsistent with the TVPRA \nis likely without merit. The TVPRA neither expressly authorizes nor expressly prohibits USCIS \nfrom rescinding a determination that a child is a UAC. 8 U.S.C. § 1232(d)(8). And although the \nAct discusses the “[s]pecialized needs of unaccompanied alien children” under the heading \n“Permanent protection for certain at-risk children,” it never expressly addresses the rights of \nindividuals who no longer qualify as UACs. Id.  \niv.  Pretext  \n \nPlaintiffs’ claim that the agency’s justification for its policy change was pretextual in \nviolation of the APA also likely fails. To the extent that the Court can draw any conclusions from \n13 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 54   Filed 08/02/19   Page 14 of 16\nthe “leaked internal memorandum” of unknown authorship that Plaintiffs point to as evidence of \npretext, the Court finds that at least one of the reasons provided is consistent with the \njustification given in the Redetermination Memo. Specifically, according to the Redetermination \nMemo, USCIS decided to change course from the 2013 policy to ensure that USCIS is making \n“jurisdictional determinations in a manner consistent with Immigration Judge determinations.” \nECF No. 15-2 at 3. Consistent with this justification, the leaked internal memo indicates that \nadministration officials were considering ordering USCIS to make changes to the 2013 policy in \npart because “DOJ allows immigration judges to make independent determinations as to when a \nminor is a UAC” and “it would be good for DHS to have the same policy.” ECF No. 15-3 at 2.  \nAlthough agencies must “examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory \nexplanation for its action,” there is no rule prohibiting an agency from supporting its action with \nseveral explanations so long as there is a “rational connection between the facts found and the \nchoice made.” See State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43 (quoting Burlington Truck Lines v. United States, \n371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)). Therefore, even to the extent that the reasons articulated in the \nRedetermination Memo do not match the primary explanation for the action offered in the \n“leaked internal memorandum” (i.e., responding to a surge in illegal border crossings), that at \nleast one of the reasons provided in that memo is consistent with the justifications given in the \nRedetermination Memo indicates that the agency’s reasoning is not pretextual.  \nUltimately, though, Plaintiffs need only demonstrate that they are likely to succeed on the \nmerits of some of their claims, and they have done so here.  \nB.  Irreparable Harm and Balance of the Equities \n \nPlaintiffs have also met their burden to demonstrate that the redetermination policy will \ncause irreparable harm if the status quo is not maintained. As previously discussed, individuals \n14 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 54   Filed 08/02/19   Page 15 of 16\nwho relied on USCIS’s longstanding policy of not rescinding UAC status may miss their \nopportunity to file for asylum all together if the one-year filing deadline from which they would \nhave otherwise been exempt is now imposed. Similarly, under the redetermination policy, \nindividuals who, relying on USCIS’s policy of adopting earlier UAC determinations, did not file \nfor asylum until after they had aged out of UAC status or until after they had been reunited with \na parent or guardian will be forced to proceed before an adversarial system where they will be \nsubject to cross-examination by trained government lawyers even though they believed that they \nwould be able to proceed before an asylum officer trained in trauma-informed interviewing.  \nFinally, analysis of the last two factors—the balance of the equities and the public \ninterest—merge here because the Government is a party, and they favor maintaining the status \nquo. Defendants have conceded that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their \nconstitutional claims and “upholding the Constitution undeniably promotes the public interest.” \nInt’l Refugee Assistance Project v. Trump, 857 F.3d 554, 604 (4th Cir. 2017). Defendants’ \nargument that a more fully developed record will show that prioritizing consistency between \njurisdictional determinations by USCIS officers and immigration judges will benefit UACs does \nnot change the Court’s conclusion that on the existing record the balance of equities tips in \nPlaintiffs’ favor. There is no evidence in the existing record that either Defendants or children \napplying for asylum will be harmed by pressing pause on enforcing the redetermination policy, \nbut Plaintiffs have shown that the new policy will cause them harm. Thus, at this time, the \nbalance of the harms favors temporary injunctive relief.     \n \n \n \n15 \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01944-GJH   Document 54   Filed 08/02/19   Page 16 of 16\nIV.  CONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order will be \ngranted. A separate Order shall issue. \n \nDate: August 2, 2019                     _/s/_________________________              \nGEORGE J. HAZEL \nUnited States District Judge \n         \n16 \n ",
