The plaintiff sued U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and President Trump under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Declaratory Judgment Act. Plaintiff sought injunctive and declaratory relief claiming violations of the APA and the Fifth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. For decades, USCIS allowed people battling serious illnesses to request deferred action. In August 2019, the Trump Administration prohibited USCIS field offices from granting deferred action to the individuals who could ordinarily be protected by this program. The plaintiff alleged this prohibition was illegal. Plaintiff was represented by the ACLU of Massachusetts, Lawyers for Civil Rights, and private counsel. Judge Indira Talwani was assigned.</p><p>The parties jointly moved to stay the case on October 29, 2019. The parties sought a settlement or other nonjudicial resolution. The court granted the stay two days later. This followed the USCIS announcement that it would reinstate the deferred action program, but requests would only be granted “based on compelling facts and circumstances.”</p><p>Defendants filed a motion to dismiss on February 28, 2020. The defendants first argued that the court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to review defendants' enforcement discretion. They also argued that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim under the Fifth Amendment. The motion was denied three days later. 2020 WL 6395575.</p><p>On June 15, 2021, plaintiff filed a notice of voluntary dismissal without prejudice regarding all claims in this case. As of July 13, 2021, no further reasoning was stated in the notice itself or on the <a href=”https://www.aclum.org/en/cases/rian-immigrant-center-v-cuccinelli”>ACLU of Massachusetts's website</a>.

It is also illegal.  \nFor decades, the United States Customs and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) has \noperated a small but vital humanitarian program that allows immigrant families battling serious \nillnesses to request immigration relief in the form of “deferred action.” The program recognizes \nthat deporting seriously ill individuals and their families is in many cases tantamount to a death \nsentence. Deferred action does not grant immigration status to beneficiaries; it confers other \nbenefits, including an opportunity to apply for work authorization, the tolling of any accrual of \n“unlawful presence” that could bar future entry into the United States, and a measure of \nprotection against removal proceedings by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”). \nThose protected by this program are in dire straits. They include the mother of a U.S. citizen \nbaby that has spent eight of the last ten months in the hospital; a ten-year-old girl with eye \ncancer; and a partially-immobilized 18-year-old boy with burns over 70% of his body. \nIn August 2019, the Trump Administration abruptly prohibited USCIS field \noffices from granting deferred action in cases of serious medical need, and has now put the lives \nof scores of medically fragile individuals at immense and immediate risk. In doing so, the \nAdministration provided no opportunity for notice-and-comment, or any other procedural \nprotection that is required under the Administrative Procedures Act (“APA”). Nor did the \nAdministration provide any rationale for its abrupt termination of the program, as required by \nlaw. \n2 \n  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11880   Document 1   Filed 09/05/19   Page 3 of 25\nBut the reasons for the Administration’s actions are all too clear: they are part of \nan overarching anti-immigrant agenda that is driven by racial and ethnic animus, and in this case \nadditional animus against persons with disabilities.  Throughout his campaign and presidency, \nDefendant Trump has derided and stoked animus against immigrants of color. Defendant \nKenneth Cuccinelli, Acting Director of USCIS has similarly described undocumented \nimmigrants as invaders and recently claimed, just days before USCIS began sending denial \nletters to people seeking deferred action, that the Statue of Liberty’s famous exhortation to “give \nme your tired, your poor” refers to “people coming from Europe . . . .”  \nPlaintiff Irish International Immigrant Center, Inc. (the “IIIC”) is a nonprofit \norganization based in Boston, Massachusetts that serves clients in Massachusetts who seek \ndeferred action based on a serious medical need. At present, the IIIC represents individuals and \nfamilies in 19 such cases, including children seeking treatment for illnesses such as cancer, \ncerebral palsy, and muscular dystrophy—and the parents who care for them. Nearly all of the \nIIIC’s deferred action clients are people of color from countries in the Caribbean, Central and \nSouth America, and Africa.  \nThe elimination of USCIS’s deferred action program has harmed the IIIC and \nendangered its clients. Deferred action benefits non-citizens with serious illness, their families, \nand the families of U.S. citizen children with serious illness. Without deferred action, the IIIC’s \nclients face the prospect of returning to countries where their life-preserving care cannot be \ncontinued, or being placed in removal proceedings. Many of the IIIC’s clients have been forced \nto contemplate the possibility of leaving behind minor children in the United States so that they \ncan continue receiving essential care. USCIS’s decision has also wreaked havoc for the IIIC. The \norganization has not only dropped almost all other work in an effort to help save the lives of its \n3 \n  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11880   Document 1   Filed 09/05/19   Page 4 of 25\nclients and their family members, but it will now be tasked with the years-long commitment of \nrepresenting these clients in complex immigration proceedings that will necessarily come at the \nexpense of the IIIC’s other work, all while losing funding tied to work that it can no longer take \non. \nBecause eliminating the authority of USCIS field offices to grant deferred action \nto individuals with dire medical needs is arbitrary, capricious, and based on impermissible \nanimus, it violates the APA and the Equal Protection guarantees of the U.S. Constitution. The \nIIIC therefore asks this Court to declare the termination of USCIS’s deferred-action program \nunlawful and enjoin its enforcement. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343.   \nThis Court has authority to issue declaratory and injunctive relief under 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 2201 and 2202, 5 U.S.C. §§ 702-06, and the Court’s inherent equitable powers.\nVenue is proper in the District of Massachusetts under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1).  \nPARTIES \n  Plaintiff Irish International Immigrant Center, Inc. is a nonprofit organization \nbased in Boston, Massachusetts.  Founded by Irish immigrants in 1989, the IIIC provides \nservices for 3,500 immigrants and refugees from more than 120 countries every year. The IIIC \nempowers newcomers with legal and other services so they can reach stability, contribute to their \ncommunities, and flourish. As part of this work, the IIIC helps immigrant families with life-\n4 \n  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11880   Document 1   Filed 09/05/19   Page 5 of 25\nthreatening illnesses apply for and secure deferred action status from USCIS.  See generally \nExhibit 1, Declaration of Anthony Marino.   \n  Defendant Kenneth Thomas Cuccinelli II is sued in his official capacity as Acting \nDirector of USCIS, a federal agency that is part of the Department of Homeland Security \n(“DHS”). As Acting Director, Mr. Cuccinelli is responsible for overseeing USCIS’s work, \nincluding its adjudication and policies regarding applications for deferred action and other \nimmigration benefits.  \n  Defendant Lori Pietropaolo is sued in her official capacity as Regional Director of \nUSCIS’s Northeast District, which includes the Boston field office. In that capacity, Ms. \nPietropaolo oversees the work of local USCIS Field Offices and, on information and belief, \nmakes decisions regarding deferred action in cases involving serious illness.  \n  Defendant Michael J. McCleary is sued in his official capacity as Director of the \nUSCIS Boston field office. In that capacity, Mr. McCleary oversees the work of the Boston field \noffice and, on information and belief, helps to make decisions regarding deferred action. \n  U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is an agency within the Department of \nHomeland Security that administers immigration benefits, including adjudicating requests for \ndeferred action based on serious illness.  \n  Defendant Kevin McAleenan is sued in his official capacity as Acting Secretary \nof the Department of Homeland Security. As DHS Acting Secretary, Mr. McAleenan is \nresponsible for the administration and enforcement of the immigration laws of the United States. \n  The Department of Homeland Security is a cabinet department of the United \nStates federal government with responsibility for, among other things, administering and \nenforcing the nation’s immigration laws. \n5 \n  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11880   Document 1   Filed 09/05/19   Page 6 of 25\n  Donald J. Trump is sued in his official capacity as the President of the United \nStates. He is ultimately responsible for the policies of all federal agencies, including DHS. \nBACKGROUND \nI. USCIS Has Long Provided Deferred Action for Families Dependent on Critical\nMedical Treatment in the United States.\n  For decades, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”), followed \nby USCIS, has used deferred action to provide relief to individuals whose cases raise compelling \nhumanitarian concerns and to individuals whose removal is not in the best interests of the U.S. \ngovernment.1 Government regulations characterize deferred action as “an act of administrative \nconvenience to the government which gives some cases lower priority.” 8 C.F.R. \n§ 274a.12(c)(14).\n  INS and USCIS have for decades granted deferred action to noncitizens who are \nreceiving treatment in the United States for serious medical conditions, and their immediate \nfamily members. For example, deferred action has been available to non-citizens who are \nthemselves receiving medical treatment in the United States, and their immediate family \nmembers. USCIS also recognizes that someone may seek deferred action on their behalf or “for \nhis/her entire family unit.”2 For example, the noncitizen parents or guardians of a U.S. citizen \n1 Citizenship & Immigration Servs. Ombudsman, Dep’t of Homeland Sec., Deferred Action: \nRecommendations to Improve Transparency and Consistency in the USCIS Process 1-2 (July 11, \n2011), https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/cisomb-combined-dar.pdf (citing INS Commissioner \nDoris Meissner, Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion, HQOPP 50/4 (Nov. 17, 2000) (“Meissner \nMem.”)). \n2 U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Servs., Standard Operating Procedures for Handling Deferred \nAction Requests at USCIS Field Offices 3 n.1 (Mar. 7, 2012) (“USCIS Standard Operating \nProcedures”). \n6 \n  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11880   Document 1   Filed 09/05/19   Page 7 of 25\nchild with a serious medical illness might seek deferred action so that child can receive treatment \nin the United States.     \n  Recipients of deferred action can remain temporarily in the United States, \nreceiving a measure of protection from being placed in removal proceedings during the period of \nthe deferred action—usually two years. Additionally, they are eligible to apply for work \nauthorization, under 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14), and they do not accrue unlawful presence under \n8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B)(i), which could otherwise foreclose future immigration benefits. \nRecipients of deferred action are also eligible to receive certain benefits, including Social \nSecurity, retirement, and disability benefits, and, in certain states, benefits such as driver’s \nlicenses or unemployment insurance.3 Deferred action thus provides stability and comfort to \nthose benefiting from the program while they or a loved one undergoes serious and sometimes \nlife-saving medical treatment. \n  Upon creation of the DHS in 2003, the power to grant deferred action was \nformally delegated to USCIS, as well as ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”).4  \n  On information and belief, deferred action requests made by individuals and \nfamilies receiving treatment for serious illness are governed by USCIS’s 2012 “Standard \n3 See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. §§ 1611(b)(2)-(3), 1621(d).  \n4 Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, § 442(c), 116 Stat. 2135, 2194 (2002); \nDep’t of Homeland Sec. Secretary Tom Ridge, Delegation to the Bureau of Citizenship and \nImmigration Services (June 5, 2003) (delegating authority to grant voluntary departure under \nsection 240B of the INA, 8 U.S.C. §1229c, and deferred action); see also U.S. Dep’t of Justice, \nImmigration & Naturalization Service Fact Sheet: Prosecutorial Discretion Guidelines (Nov. 28, \n2000). \n7 \n  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11880   Document 1   Filed 09/05/19   Page 8 of 25\nOperating Procedures for Handling Deferred Action Requests at USCIS Field Offices,” which \napply to “all requests for deferred action . . . handled at USCIS Field Offices.”5   \n  Applications to USCIS for deferred action based on medical need follow uniform \nprocedures and involve individualized determinations. Applications are filed at local USCIS field \noffices. Each application is reviewed by a Field Office Director and/or District Director before a \nUSCIS Regional Director makes a final determination on behalf of the field office.   \n  Applications must be signed by the applicants and are expected to include an \nexplanation as to the basis for deferred action, including medical and other supporting \ndocumentation. USCIS recognizes that those requesting deferred action may provide extensive \nand sensitive “supporting documentation,” including but not limited to proof of identity and \nnationality, biographic information, “medical information, evidence of community and familial \nties and equities, conditions in the requestor’s country of origin, etc.”6  In the Boston field office, \nUSCIS provided a checklist to potential filers explaining the requirements for deferred action \napplications, including a detailed letter from the treating physician.  See Exhibit 2, Declaration of \nMahsa Khanbabai, ¶ 5 at Exhibit A. \n  Applicants for deferred action are fingerprinted, and USCIS must complete a list \nof required background checks on those individuals before approving a request.7  \nApplicants for deferred action may not have lawful immigration status. \n5 USCIS Standard Operating Procedures at 3. \n6 Id. at 3. Similarly, USCIS’s notice template for granting deferred action requires recipients “to \nnotify USCIS if [they] change [their] address” using a form that requires the recipients to \ndisclose not only their names and addresses, but also their dates of birth, nations of origin, and \nalien registration numbers. Id. at 9 (citing Form AR-11). \n7 Id. at 4-6. \n8 \n  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11880   Document 1   Filed 09/05/19   Page 9 of 25\n  Under its Standard Operating Procedures, USCIS also rejects applications for \ndeferred action based on serious medical illness if the noncitizens are in removal proceedings or \nhave final orders of removal.8  \n  USCIS field office decisions to grant deferred action in cases involving serious \nillness are distinct from decisions against issuing a Notice to Appear for removal proceedings.9 \nThus, when USCIS denies deferred action to individuals who are not already in removal \nproceedings, its “non-grant” template directs USCIS’s field offices to state that “[d]enial of a \nrequest for deferred action does not necessarily mean that USCIS intends affirmatively to pursue \nyour removal.”10 But when individuals are already in removal proceedings, USCIS’s template \ndirects its field offices to tell the individuals to “direct your request for deferred action to \n[ICE].”11 \nII. The Irish International Immigrant Center Represents Numerous Individuals Who\nQualify for Deferred Action Due to Serious Medical Needs.\n  USCIS has long recognized that a request for deferred action, including deferred \naction due to serious medical needs, may be made by “an attorney or representative.”12 \n  The IIIC is a nonprofit that advocates for the rights of immigrants and provides \nlegal and other services for noncitizens.   \n  The IIIC employs a staff of six attorneys and two program associates who provide \nimmigration legal services.  The legal services provided by the IIIC include legal clinics serving \n8 Id. at 3-4, 12-13. \n9 See Meissner Mem.. \n10 USCIS Standard Operating Procedures at 11 (emphasis added). \n11 Id. at 13. \n12 Id. at 3 n.1. \n9 \n  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11880   Document 1   Filed 09/05/19   Page 10 of 25\nmore than 2,000 individuals every year, forms assistance to more than 400 individuals per year \nin cases in which the IIIC does not enter an appearance, and direct representation of \napproximately 400 individuals at any given time who are filing applications for benefits before \nUSCIS.   \n  Many of the IIIC’s legal services are provided for a fee that is approximately 10% \nof that ordinarily charged by private attorneys for the same work.  For example, the IIIC \ncurrently charges $85 for an adjustment of status application for an asylee or refugee, and $350 \nfor representation in a complex citizenship application.  Many of the IIIC’s clients cannot pay \nthese fees and, as a result, pay no fees at all.  The IIIC technically assigns a $500 fee for deferred \naction cases, but it generally does not collect any fees at all.  In one instance, a client contributed \n$100.  In all others, the IIIC waived its fees and collected nothing from the clients.     \n  The IIIC’s legal services work aims to make legal advice and representation \navailable to as many people as possible.  These services thus focus on providing free or low-cost \nrepresentation to people who have affirmative avenues for seeking legal status, and making \ninformation and advice available to many others through thousands of free consultations \nprovided at the IIIC’s legal clinics every year.  Although the IIIC does sometimes represent \nclients who are detained and/or in removal proceedings, the IIIC’s experience with these cases \ndemonstrates that such matters can significantly monopolize the time of the attorneys involved \nand thus greatly diminish those attorneys’ ability to take on other clients or provide legal \nconsultations through the IIIC’s clinics. Due to the large time commitments involved in these \ncases, the IIIC has not customarily taken on clients who are in removal proceedings.  \n  Among its other cases, the IIIC represents individuals and families applying for \ndeferred action from USCIS as a result of a serious medical need.  These deferred action cases \n10 \n  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11880   Document 1   Filed 09/05/19   Page 11 of 25\nhave come to the IIIC in a variety of ways, including through its walk-in clinics, partnerships \nwith area hospitals, and other referrals.  \n  More recently, in order to expand the IIIC’s ability to meet the needs of hospital \npatients for deferred action and other legal services, the IIIC has developed more formalized \npartnerships with two local hospitals that provide specific financial support for this work.  These \npartnerships allow the IIIC to deliver legal services to critically ill patients, including \nconsultations and representation for deferred action and other avenues of relief when available.  \n  This year the IIIC and its partners fundraised for its collaboration with area \nhospitals together, highlighting for prospective donors the critically ill patients that had been and \ncould be helped by the IIIC to obtain deferred action.  These partnerships are in their early \nstages, but new funding through these two medical partnerships in 2019 have accounted for the \ncost of approximately one half of an attorney’s salary.  \n  The 2019 funding allowed the IIIC to provide full representation to ten new \nclients who are patients at one of the two partner hospitals, including three who were seeking \ndeferred action based on a serious medical need.   \n  All told, the IIIC currently represents 19 individuals and families who have or are \nin the process of applying for or seeking to renew deferred action based on a serious medical \nneed.  \nThese families comprise 33 individuals, most of them people of color.  \n  Of these 19 deferred action cases, six involve Haitian families or individuals and \nfour involve families from the Dominican Republic. Five cases involve families or individuals \nfrom Central and South American countries; three cases involve African families or individuals. \nThe remaining client is a European national.  \n11 \n  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11880   Document 1   Filed 09/05/19   Page 12 of 25\n  The IIIC has filed a new applications for deferred action as recently as August 16, \n2019, when it filed an application on behalf of a client with terminal breast cancer.  \n  The IIIC’s 19 deferred action cases mostly involve families of children with \nserious medical illnesses for which treatment is unavailable in the countries in which they or \ntheir parents were born.   \nAmong these clients are: \n The mother of a six-month-old U.S. citizen who suffered a neonatal stroke.\n The mother of a ten-month-old U.S. citizen who has been hospitalized eight of\nthose ten months with multiple complex diagnoses, including ambiguous\ngenitalia, corneal clouding, and autoimmune interopathy.\n A six-year-old with multiple diagnoses who is undergoing testing, is confined to a\nwheelchair, and uses a feeding tube, and his mother.\n The parents of a six-year-old U.S. citizen with more than 20 complex diagnoses\narising from premature birth, including developmental delays, chronic lung\ndisease, pulmonary hypertension, and encephalopathy (damage or disease to the\nbrain).\n A seven-year-old with a severe form of epilepsy involving multiple seizures a day\nand a risk of sudden death, and his mother and sibling.\n A ten-year-old blinded by eye cancer, and her mother.\n A 12-year-old with cerebral palsy who is confined to a wheelchair, suffers\nseizures, and is scheduled for major surgery later this month, and his parents.\n A 13-year-old with Duchenne’s Muscular Dystrophy, and his mother.\n A 16-year-old with cystic fibrosis and his parents.\n An 18-year-old with burns over 70% of his body and immobilized arms and\nhands, who has been undergoing reconstructive surgery in order to clear scar\ntissue obstructing his mouth and ears, and his mother.\n A 24-year-old suffering complications from a bone marrow transplant performed\nto treat his leukemia, and his parents and minor sibling.\n12 \n  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11880   Document 1   Filed 09/05/19   Page 13 of 25\nAn adult with incurable breast cancer. \n  Before August 19, 2019, the IIIC represented nine of these individuals and \nfamilies in applications for deferred action for which the IIIC had not yet received a response. \nThese nine cases comprised two applications to renew deferred action and seven new \napplications.  \nThe IIIC was also preparing to file applications for three new families or \nindividuals. \n  The IIIC also represents seven individuals or families who have received deferred \naction that is set to expire in 2020. For example, in March 2020, deferred action will expire for \nthe family of the seven-year-old boy whose epilepsy is so severe that it results in multiple \nseizures a day and a risk of sudden death.  \nIII. USCIS Abruptly Terminated Deferred Action in Non-Military Cases.\n  On August 7, 2019, USCIS abruptly and without notice stopped its consideration \nof deferred action for non-military requestors.  \nUSCIS did not publicly announce its change in policy. \nNor, on information and belief, did it provide a reason for the change.  \nAround August 15, 2019, USCIS’ Boston field office began sending denial letters \nto deferred action applicants.  \n  The IIIC, on behalf of its clients, received the first of these letters on August 19, \n2019, from the USCIS Boston Field Office Director. Denial of applications for six additional \nclients followed, all of which were dated between August 15 and 22, 2019.  True and correct \ncopies of three of these letters with identifying information redacted are attached to Exhibit 1, the \nDeclaration of Anthony Marino, as Exhibits A-C.   \n13 \n  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11880   Document 1   Filed 09/05/19   Page 14 of 25\n  These letters—using language identical to letters sent around the country—\ninformed noncitizens that deferred action had been denied because USCIS field offices “no \nlonger consider deferred action requests” in non-military cases.  \n  The letters further notified families that, because their presence in the United \nStates at the time they applied for deferred action was unlawful—a requirement for applying—\nthey are now “not authorized to remain the United States.” \nThe letters did not mention any alternative means of applying for deferred action. \n  To the contrary, they threatened: “If you fail to depart the United States within 33 \ndays of the date of this letter, USCIS may issue you a Notice to Appear and commence removal \nproceedings against you with the immigration court. This may result in your being removed from \nthe United States and found ineligible for a future visa or other U.S. immigration benefit.” \nUSCIS ended its deferred action program so abruptly that, in one case, it \nwithdrew a request for additional evidence that it had sent to one of the IIIC’s clients only three \nweeks earlier—telling the family to “disregard this request as USCIS will no longer process your \ndeferred action request.”13 In another case, where a family represented by the IIIC was scheduled \nfor an interview that was to take place five days after the denial notice was sent out, USCIS \ninformed them that “this interview is cancelled since USCIS will not process your deferred \naction request.”14 \n13 Ex. 1, Decl. of Anthony Marino, Ex. B. \n14 Id., Ex. C. \n14 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11880   Document 1   Filed 09/05/19   Page 15 of 25\n  On August 26, 2019, USCIS told members of the press that “medical deferred \naction requests are now submitted to ICE for consideration,”15 as opposed to USCIS, as had been \npreviously done.     \n  Upon information and belief, ICE was not informed that USCIS would stop \nprocessing non-military deferred action requests, and on further information and belief, has no \nplans to take over the program. An ICE official stated, “ICE is not going to implement any sort \nof a program or procedure or policy to take over that function.”16 \n  On information and belief, ICE does not process applications for deferred action \nfor individuals who do not have final orders of removal. And every individual who was \npreviously eligible to obtain deferred action from USCIS based on medical need was not in \nremoval proceedings and did not have an order of removal.  \n  On September 2, 2019, after sustained public pressure, USCIS issued a press \nrelease stating that it was reopening “non-military deferred action cases that were pending on \nAugust 7.” The release further made clear that the program has been otherwise terminated. \n15 Shannon Dooling, After Receiving Denial Letters, Immigrants Fear End of Medical Deferral \nProgram, WBUR (Aug. 26, 2019), http://www.wbur.org/news/2019/08/26/medical-deferment-\nimmigration-program-ended. \n16 Shannon Dooling, Feds Can’t Agree on Which Agency — If Any — Handles Medical \nDeportation Deferrals, WBUR (Aug. 28, 2019), http://www.wbur.org/news/2019/08/28/ice-\nuscis-immigrants-medical-deferred-action.  \n15 \n  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11880   Document 1   Filed 09/05/19   Page 16 of 25\nIV. USCIS’s Decision to Terminate Deferred Action Has Endangered the IIIC’s Clients\nand Directly Harmed the IIIC.\n  The termination of deferred action has caused immeasurable agony, distress, \nheartbreak, confusion, and fear for the IIIC’s clients.   \n  The IIIC’s clients who had not received letters notifying them of the termination \nsoon learned about the decision from their counsel at the IIIC, and from media reports.  \n  For many of the IIIC’s clients, the termination of deferred action is life \nthreatening, because they may no longer be able to receive care in the United States.  \n  For many of the IIIC’s clients, who are the family members of U.S. citizen \nchildren, USCIS’s decision raises untenable choices about whether to leave children alone in the \nUnited States to receive life-preserving care, or instead take them abroad to countries where their \nmedical conditions might quickly kill them.  \n  Many of the IIIC’s current or future clients would face substantial hindrances if \nthey were to attempt to bring litigation to vindicate their own interests with respect to deferred \naction. For example, the IIIC’s clients include children who cannot file suit on their own behalf, \nadults who are absorbed in important health care decisions and in the day-to-day needs of their \nchildren’s treatment, and families who are terrified of public attention and of any real or \nperceived dispute with the federal government, from whom they, by definition, wish to secure \nrelief. The IIIC’s clients also include adults who are unable to communicate and/or are \nterminally ill. \n  Meanwhile, the termination of deferred action has also had direct and substantial \nimpacts for the IIIC itself.  \n  Since learning of it, the IIIC’s limited staff has been almost entirely absorbed in \ncounseling, supporting, and advocating for affected families, at the expense of all other work.  \n16 \n  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11880   Document 1   Filed 09/05/19   Page 17 of 25\n  IIIC staff attorneys have spent dozens of hours providing legal advice to affected \nindividuals and families, helping them to attempt to absorb and understand the news and \ndiscussing options and possible future scenarios with them. They have had to discuss the impact \nof USCIS’s decision with their clients’ health care providers in order to explain the possible \nramifications of the new policy in each case. And each time that new developments have \narisen—including USCIS’s contention that ICE would take over deferred action and USCIS’ \nSeptember 2, 2019 announcement that it would reopen certain cases—IIIC attorneys have had to \nexplain these shifts to their clients, medical providers, and others.  \n  The IIIC also determined that it was necessary to launch a public campaign. It \norganized a press conference, worked closely with clients who chose to make their stories public, \nand communicated with public officials, lawyers, community groups, religious leaders, and \nreporters. \n  By the week of August 26, 2019, the termination of deferred action was national \nnews; the IIIC’s Executive Director and Legal Director have been interviewed multiple times \nand quoted in dozens of media outlets.   \n  As a consequence of their time spent providing legal counsel to and advocating \nfor and alongside its deferred action clients, IIIC attorneys have postponed non-urgent work on \nother cases, cancelled appointments, suspended the scheduling of cases in which the IIIC \nprovides assistance with immigration forms, and stopped opening new full-representation cases. \n  In addition to impairing the IIIC’s ability to serve its mission of making low-cost \nlegal services available to more people, the IIIC’s inability to open new cases will immediately \nlead to hundreds of dollars of lost fee revenue associated with the full representation and form-\nassistance cases for which the IIIC charges a modest fee.  \n17 \n  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11880   Document 1   Filed 09/05/19   Page 18 of 25\n  USCIS’s decision to terminate non-military deferred action will continue to harm \nthe IIIC in the long term.   \n  First, without deferred action for people with serious medical conditions, the \nIIIC’s continued representation of its deferred action clients and people who would be such \nclients—but for the termination of the program—will require substantial time commitments for \nyears to come. This will come at a heavy cost to the IIIC’s ability to take on other cases, harming \nboth its mission and ability to collect fees.  \n  Many, if not all, of the IIIC’s deferred action clients with serious medical \nconditions will be unable or unwilling to leave the life-preserving care that they or their children \nreceive in the United States, and will face the risk of being placed in removal proceedings either \nimmediately or after their deferred action status concludes. New prospective clients with serious \nmedical illness will similarly face such risks. On information and belief, the IIIC’s current and \nfuture clients will be able to seek deferred action status from ICE only if they go through \nremoval proceedings and are ordered removed.  \n  Representing its deferred action clients in removal proceedings is a years-long \ncommitment for the IIIC due to the significant expenditures of attorney time that each removal \ncase will require. Although the IIIC will continue to represent its deferred action clients in \nremoval proceedings if possible, that representation will come at a significant cost to the \norganization’s ability to take larger numbers of other cases, with consequences both for its \nmission, the community it serves, and for its generation of fees.  \n   Second, the termination of non-military deferred action is likely to lead to a loss \nof funding for the IIIC, including but not limited funding it receives from hospitals.   \n18 \n  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11880   Document 1   Filed 09/05/19   Page 19 of 25\n  The IIIC has developed partnerships with hospitals, and receives funding that is a \ndirect result of its ability to represent clients facing serious illness in seeking deferred action \nbefore USCIS. If the IIIC is no longer able to take on these cases because deferred action for \npeople with serious medical conditions is unavailable, it is likely to lose some or all of the \nfunding that it receives from hospitals.  \nV. USCIS’s Decision Was Motived By Animus Based on Race and National Origin, and\nDisability.\n  On information and belief, the defendants’ decision to terminate USCIS’s non-\nmilitary deferred action program was a consequence of impermissible animus based on race, \nnational origin, and disability.   \n  Many of the Trump Administration’s immigration policies—from the decisions to \nrender one million noncitizens unlawfully present,17 to the calls for the elimination of “chain \nmigration,”18 to the policies obstructing citizenship for lawful permanent residents in the \n17  Adam Adelman, Trump Ends DACA Program, No New Applications Accepted, NBC News \n(Sept. 5, 2017), https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/trump-dreamers-daca-\nimmigration-announcement-n798686 (noting that termination of DACA affected as many as \n800,000 “Dreamers”); Nick Miroff & David Nakamura, 200,000 Salvadorans May Be Forced to \nLeave the U.S. as Trump Ends Immigration Protection, Wash.

Specifically, while acknowledging that America had in \nprior generations welcomed people lacking financial means, Mr. Cuccinelli argued that those \nwere “people coming from Europe, where they had class-based societies” and that today’s \nimmigrants must be able to take care of themselves.31 \n  Days after making these statements, USCIS mailed letters informing the IIIC’s \nclients, and countless others, that their requests for deferred action were denied because USCIS \nhad eliminated its deferred action program. \n29 Andrew Kaczynski, Trump Official Has Talked About Undocumented Immigrants as \n“Invaders” Since at Least 2007, CNN (Aug. 17, 2019), \nhttps://www.cnn.com/2019/08/17/politics/kfile-ken-cuccinelli-immigration-invasion-\nrhetoric/index.html. \n30 Id. \n31 Colby Itkowitz and Felicia Sonmez, ‘Who Can Stand on Their Own Two Feet’: Ken Cuccinelli \nEdits Famous Statue of Liberty Poem, Wash.

It is thus a substantive rule requiring notice-and-comment. \n  The defendants’ termination of USCIS’s deferred action program is also based on \nimpermissible animus, which is contrary to law. \n  The termination of USCIS’s authority to grant deferred action in non-military \ncases thus violates the APA. \n23 \n  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11880   Document 1   Filed 09/05/19   Page 24 of 25\nCOUNT 2 – THE EQUAL PROTECTION GUARANTEE OF THE FIFTH \nAMENDMENT TO THE U.S. CONSTITUTION \n(Animus based on race, national origin, and disability) \nThe foregoing allegations are re-alleged and incorporated herein. \n  Plaintiff has a right under the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution to equal \nprotection of the laws.  \nOn information and belief, the defendants’ termination of deferred action was \nimpermissibly motivated by racial animus and animus based on national origin, in violation of \nthe Equal Protection Clause. Village of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. \n252, 265-266 (1977).  \n  On information and belief, the defendants’ termination of deferred action was \nimpermissibly motivated by animus against persons with disabilities, and cannot survive even \nrational basis review. See City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432 (1985). \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \nWherefore, the Irish International Immigrant Center respectfully requests that this Court: \n1. Vacate and set aside the defendants’ termination of USCIS field offices’ authority\nto grant deferred action in non-military cases, as well as any action taken by the defendants to \neffect that termination; \n2. Declare that all actions taken by the defendants to terminate USCIS field offices’\nauthority to grant deferred action in non-military cases are void and without legal force or effect; \n3. Declare that all actions taken by the defendants to terminate USCIS field offices’\nauthority to grant deferred action in non-military cases are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, otherwise not in accordance with law, and without observance of procedure required \nby law, in violation of 5 U.S.C. §§ 702-706; \n24 \n  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11880   Document 1   Filed 09/05/19   Page 25 of 25\n4.

Preliminarily and permanently enjoin the defendants, their agents, servants,\nemployees, attorneys, and all persons in active concert or participation with any of them, from \nimplementing or enforcing the termination of USCIS’s non-military deferred action program, \nand from taking any other action to terminate that program that is not in compliance with \napplicable law; and \n6.
