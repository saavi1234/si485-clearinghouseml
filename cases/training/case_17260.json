It is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED: That for the reasons stated in the Court's Memorandum Opinion and Order dated September 5, 2019, if true (and the Court has assumed that they are true for purposes of this motion), Plaintiffs' allegations are certainly troubling. According to the Complaint, unrepresented immigrant families and children find themselves in \"a classic Catch-22 situation\": having been deprived of notice and the opportunity to challenge entry of removal orders in the first instance, the only way they can challenge those orders now is by filing written motions to reopen. Opp'n at I; see Comp!. Paragraphs 3-6. But without counsel, English fluency, or an ability to navigate the complex immigration system, they realistically cannot file written motions to reopen to bring those failures [in notice] to light.\" Opp'n at I. In light of Sections 1252(a)(5) and (b )(9), however, any remedy for these circumstances lies not in this Court, but elsewhere: in immigration court (by way of a motion to reopen), in the Court of Appeals (by way of a petition for review), or in Congress (by way of changing the law). Accordingly, and for the foregoing reasons, Defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction is GRANTED and the Complaint is dismissed; accordingly, the case is closed.

If true (and the Court has assumed that they are true for purposes of this motion), Plaintiffs' allegations are certainly troubling. According to the Complaint, unrepresented immigrant families and children find themselves in \"a classic Catch-22 situation\": having been deprived of notice and the opportunity to challenge entry of removal orders in the first instance, the only way they can challenge those orders now is by filing written motions to reopen. Opp'n at 1; see Compl. Paragraphs 3-6. But without counsel, English fluency, or an ability to navigate the complex immigration system, they realistically cannot file written motions to reopen to bring those failures [in notice] to light.\" Opp'n at 1. In light of Sections 1252(a)(5) and (b)(9),however, any remedy for these circumstances lies not in this Court, but elsewhere: in immigration court (by way of a motion to reopen), in the Court of Appeals (by way of a petition for review), or in Congress (by way of changing the law). Accordingly, and for the foregoing reasons, Defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction is GRANTED and the Complaint is dismissed. The Clerk of Court is directed to terminate ECF No. 39 and to close the case. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Jesse M. Furman on 9/05/2019) (ama) Transmission to Orders and Judgments Clerk for processing. (Entered: 09/05/2019)"

    "summary": "<p>On July 11, 2019, a group of organizations dedicated to helping immigrant families and children including Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, Central American Resource Center – LA, Immigrant Defenders Law Center, and Public Counsel filed this lawsuit, pro se, in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs, sued Attorney General William Barr, the directors of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and other U.S. officials under <i> Ex Parte Young </i> and the Immigration and Nationality Act. The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants violated the due process of the Fifth Amendment by entering removal orders without first affording unrepresented immigrant families proper notice of a hearing or a meaningful opportunity to be heard. In addition, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants violated the refugee-protection provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act and its prohibition on removal to a country where the individual would face persecution or torture. Represented by the ACLU of Southern California, New York Civil Liberties Union, and private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees and costs. They sought a declaration and corresponding injunctive order that, under the due process clause, “all currently unrepresented families and children who were ordered removed <i> in absentia </i> on or after May 1, 2014 are entitled, prior to their physical removal, to . . . a hearing before an immigration judge” and, in advance of the hearing, to access to their immigration files and certain related records.</p><p>Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that thousands of immigrant families, mostly from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, were in danger of deportation during rumored en masse arrests in the summer of 2019.  These families had all arrived to the United States within the past 5 years and claimed asylum, but never had their claims for asylum and related relief heard by an immigration judge.  Instead, they were ordered deported <i> in absentia </i> for failing to appear at their hearings.  The plaintiffs claimed that these orders violated the refugees’ due process rights as they had little to no notice of the hearings.  According to the plaintiffs, hearing notices were frequently sent to the wrong address, sent with no date or time specified, or specified for dates and times (including weekends) when no hearings could actually take place, or dates that did not exist, such as September 31.  When notices were sent to the right address for the right time, the plaintiffs alleged the notices were sent too late and for locations far from the immigrants’ homes.  This meant that immigrants received the notice days after the hearings, or were forced to travel across the country on only a few days’ notice.  Finally, deportation <i> in absentia </i> was ordered on multiple children, who could not read English had no control over whether they could attend their own hearings. The plaintiffs argue that the process by which unrepresented immigrants may challenge the removal orders, by filing a written motion to reopen, is effectively unavailable to those who speak limited English and lack the capacity to read, understand, and comply with the requirements for writing and filing a motion to reopen.</p><p>On July 16, 2019, the plaintiffs moved for an expedited discovery process due to the imminent harm that could come to the immigrant families.  District Judge Jesse M. Furman granted the motion and ordered counsel for all parties to meet on July 18th.  Judge Furman issued an opinion on July 17, 2019 lifting the usual limitations on remote electronic access to the court docket for actions related to an order of removal. </p><p>The defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction on July 24, 2019.  The defendants claimed that the court lacked jurisdiction under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA). The defendants argued the claims should be dismissed because under the IIRIRA, all challenges of immigration proceedings and removal orders must be channeled to the courts of appeals.  They also argued that 8 U.S.C. section 1252(g) eliminated the court’s jurisdiction because it barred review of claims arising from the decision or action to execute removal orders.  Finally, they argued the injunctive relief that the plaintiffs sought was impossible due to immigration regulations that only allow injunctive relief for individual plaintiffs, not groups (8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1)). </p><p>On September 5, 2019, Judge Furman agreed with the defendants’ arguments and granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss. 409 F. Supp. 3d 221. Judge Furman was troubled by the plaintiffs’ allegations but found that any remedy for these circumstances lied elsewhere: in immigration court (by way of a motion to reopen), in the Court of Appeals (by way of a petition for review), or in Congress (by way of changing the law). The court clerk issued final judgment and dismissed the complaint the next day. </p><p>On November 4, 2019, the plaintiffs filed an appeal with the 2nd Circuit. However, the plaintiffs withdrew their appeal on November 21, 2019, and the appeal was dismissed with prejudice. The case is closed.</p><p></p>",

If true \n(and the Court has assumed that they are true for purposes of this \nmotion), Plaintiffs' allegations are certainly troubling. According to \nthe Complaint, unrepresented immigrant families and children find \nthemselves in \"a classic Catch-22 situation\": having been deprived \nof notice and the opportunity to challenge entry of removal orders \nin the first instance, the only way they can challenge those orders \nnow is by filing written motions to reopen. Opp'n at 1; see Compl. \nParagraphs 3-6. But without counsel, English fluency, or an ability \nto navigate the complex immigration system, they realistically \ncannot file written motions to reopen to bring those failures [in \nnotice] to light.\" Opp'n at 1. In light of Sections 1252(a)(5) and \n(b)(9),however, any remedy for these circumstances lies not in this \nCourt, but elsewhere: in immigration court (by way of a motion to \n\nreopen), in the Court of Appeals (by way of a petition for review), \nor in Congress (by way of changing the law). Accordingly, and for \nthe foregoing reasons, Defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of \nsubject-matter jurisdiction is GRANTED and the Complaint is \ndismissed. The Clerk of Court is directed to terminate ECF No. 39 \nand to close the case. SO ORDERED.

FURMAN, United States District Judge: \n  Rule 5.2(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that, “[u]nless the court \norders otherwise,” limitations on remote electronic access apply to actions or proceedings that \n“relat[e] to an order of removal, to relief from removal, or to immigration benefits or detention.”  \nBecause Plaintiffs in this case selected “Other Immigration Actions” as the nature of suit on their \ncivil cover sheet, those limitations currently apply.  See Docket No. 2. \n  In the Court’s view, those limitations are unwarranted and inappropriate in this case for at \nleast two reasons.  First, given the nature of this case — namely, that it does not involve an \nindividual order of removal or relate to the immigration benefits or detention of an individual — \nit is less likely to involve the sort of “sensitive information” that prompted the adoption of Rule \n5.2(c).  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 5.2 advisory committee notes.  And to the extent that filings in the \ncase do include sensitive information, the usual tools at the Court’s disposal — including \nredaction and sealing — should suffice.  Second, given the nature of (and public interest in) the \ncase, there is a particularly strong interest in promoting readily available public access to the  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-06443-JMF   Document 30   Filed 07/17/19   Page 2 of 2\nrecord.  See generally Lugosch v.

FURMAN, United States District Judge: \nPlaintiffs, a group of organizations dedicated to helping immigrant families and children, \nbring this action to challenge removal orders that the Government obtained with respect to \nunrepresented immigrants without first affording them proper notice of a hearing or a meaningful \nopportunity to be heard.  See ECF No. 1 (“Compl.”), ¶¶ 1, 35-36, 40-46, 49.  In particular, \nPlaintiffs challenge the lawfulness of in absentia removal orders entered pursuant to allegedly \ndeficient notices to appear (“NTAs”) before immigration judges.  According to Plaintiffs, those \nNTAs sometimes reflected the incorrect dates of upcoming appearances; were sent to incorrect \naddresses; did not include the dates, times, or locations of upcoming appearances; or were “sent \nto children who cannot read English and/or have no control over whether they appear.”  See ECF \nNo. 42 (“Opp’n”), at 3-4.  Plaintiffs contend that the process by which unrepresented immigrants \nmay challenge the removal orders — that is, by filing a written motion to reopen — is effectively \nunavailable to those who “speak limited[,] if any[,] English” and “lack the capacity to read, \nunderstand, and comply with the requirements for writing and filing a motion to reopen.”  \nCompl. ¶ 57.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs argue, “the motion-to-reopen process does not provide \n\nCase 1:19-cv-06443-JMF   Document 48   Filed 09/05/19   Page 2 of 10\nunrepresented individuals facing imminent removal any meaningful opportunity to challenge \ndefects in their in absentia removal orders prior to deportation.”  Id. ¶ 60.   \nPlaintiffs seek both declaratory and injunctive relief.  More specifically, they seek a \ndeclaration that, under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, “all currently \nunrepresented families and children who were ordered removed in absentia on or after May 1, \n2014 are entitled, prior to their physical removal, to . . . a hearing before an immigration judge” \nand, in advance of such a hearing, to access to their immigration files and certain related records.  \nCompl. at 25-26 (Prayer for Relief).  And they seek an order that both “requir[es]” the \nGovernment to hold hearings as to such persons in order “to determine whether their removal \norder[s] should be rescinded” and, in advance of such a hearing, “grant[s] each such person” \naccess to their immigration files and certain related records.  Id.  Defendants now move, pursuant \nto Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to dismiss.  They argue, among other \nthings, that the REAL ID Act of 2005, 8 U.S.C. § 1252 et seq., prevents this Court from \nreviewing or otherwise interfering with the in absentia removal orders at the heart of Plaintiffs’ \nclaims.  See ECF No. 40 (“Defs.’ Mem.”).  Plaintiffs oppose the motion on the ground that the \nREAL ID Act’s jurisdiction-stripping and jurisdiction-channeling provisions do not apply to the \nspecific facts of this case and, to the extent that they do, are unconstitutional under the \nSuspension Clause.  For the reasons that follow, the Court concludes that the Government has the \nbetter argument and that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims. \nLEGAL STANDARDS \nA case must be dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) “when the district court lacks the \nstatutory or constitutional power to adjudicate it.”  Makarova v. United States, 201 F.3d 110, 113 \n(2d Cir. 2000) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1)).  In considering a motion to dismiss for lack of \n2 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-06443-JMF   Document 48   Filed 09/05/19   Page 3 of 10\nsubject-matter jurisdiction, “the district court may consider evidence outside the pleadings,” \nMorrison v. Nat’l Australia Bank Ltd., 547 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir. 2008) (citation omitted), aff’d, \n130 S.Ct. 2869 (2010); see Luckett v. Bure, 290 F.3d 493, 496-97 (2d Cir. 2002), and must accept \nPlaintiffs’ “material factual allegations” as true, Atl. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Balfour Maclaine Int’l Ltd., \n968 F.2d 196, 198 (2d Cir. 1992); cf. ECF No. 43 (“July 18 Conf. Tr.”), at 30 (articulating the \nGovernment’s contention “that the Court . . . lack[s] jurisdiction regardless of the validity of \n[Plaintiffs’] underlying arguments, whether [the unrepresented immigrant families and children] \nreceived notice or not” (emphasis added)).  That said, because “[t]he burden of proving \njurisdiction is on the party asserting it,” Malik v. Meissner, 82 F.3d 560, 562 (2d Cir. 1996) \n(internal quotation marks omitted), “argumentative inferences favorable to the party asserting \njurisdiction should not be drawn,” Balfour Maclaine, 968 F.2d at 198.   \nDISCUSSION \nThe REAL ID Act of 2005 provides that, “[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law \n(statutory or nonstatutory), . . . a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals . . .  \nshall be the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of an order of removal.”  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(a)(5).  Further, “[j]udicial review of all questions of law and fact, including interpretation \nand application of constitutional and statutory provisions, arising from any action taken or \nproceeding brought to remove an alien from the United States” is “available only in judicial \nreview of a final order under this section.  Except as otherwise provided . . . , no court shall have \njurisdiction, . . . by any . . . provision of law (statutory or nonstatutory), to review such an order \nor such questions of law or fact.”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9).  As the Ninth Circuit has explained, \n“[t]aken together, § 1252(a)(5) and § 1252(b)(9) mean that any issue — whether legal or factual \n— arising from any removal-related activity can be reviewed only through” a petition for review \n3 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-06443-JMF   Document 48   Filed 09/05/19   Page 4 of 10\nfiled with an appropriate court of appeals.  J.E.F.M. v. Lynch, 837 F.3d 1026, 1031 (9th Cir. \n2016); see 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(a)(5), (b)(2).  Put differently, Sections 1252(a)(5) and 1252(b)(9) \nchannel all challenges to removal orders and removal proceedings to the courts of appeals. \nThe Second Circuit examined these provisions in Delgado v. Quarantillo, 643 F.3d 52 \n(2d Cir. 2011).  In that case, the plaintiff had already been removed from the country once and \nreentered without inspection.  See id. at 53.  Several years later, she married a U.S. citizen and \nsought permanent resident status; in connection with that effort, she filed a Form I-212, which, if \ngranted, waives the inadmissibility of a previously removed alien and permits him or her to apply \nfor adjustment of status.  See id. at 53-54 & n.1.  The United States Customs and Immigration \nServices (“USCIS”) denied Delgado’s I-212 request and her application for adjustment of status \nand reinstated the order of removal against her.  See id. at 54.  After unsuccessfully appealing the \nremoval order to the Second Circuit, Delgado brought a mandamus action in the district court “to \ncompel USCIS to make a determination on the merits of her I-212 application, alleging that \nUSCIS denied her application in violation of the [APA].”  Id.  Holding that Section 1252(a)(5)’s \n“jurisdictional bar applies . . . to preclude . . . an indirect challenge” to an order of removal, and \nthat whether a plaintiff is bringing an indirect challenge turns “on the substance of the relief” \nsought, the Second Circuit concluded that the district court lacked jurisdiction to hear Delgado’s \ncase.  Id. at 55.  The Court did so despite acknowledging that granting an I-212 waiver “would \nnot per se prevent [Delgado’s] removal.”  Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).  “Obtaining \nsuch a waiver,” the Court reasoned, was “a necessary prerequisite to her ultimate goal of \nadjustment of status. . . .  [A]n ‘adjustment-of-status challenge is inextricably linked to the \nreinstatement of [an alien’s] removal order,’ because ‘a nunc pro tunc Form I-212 waiver of \ninadmissibility and the adjustment of status to that of [a lawful permanent resident]’ would \n4 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-06443-JMF   Document 48   Filed 09/05/19   Page 5 of 10\nrender the reinstatement order ‘invalid.’”  Id. (quoting Morales-Izquierdo v. Dep’t of Homeland \nSec., 600 F.3d 1076, 1082-83 (9th Cir. 2010)). \nFollowing Delgado, district courts in this Circuit — including this Court — have \ndismissed a wide variety of indirect challenges to removal orders for lack of jurisdiction.  See, \ne.g., Vidhja v. Whitaker, No. 19-CV-613 (PGG), 2019 WL 1090369, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 6, \n2019) (petition seeking a stay of removal while a motion to reopen was pending before the BIA); \nNoor v. Homan, No. 17-CV-1558 (WFK), 2018 WL 1313233, at *3-4 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 27, 2018) \n(petition seeking a stay of removal or adjustment of status where “the practical effect of \n[adjusting] Plaintiff’s status . . . would be to void the removal order”); Singh v. United States \nCitizenship & Immigration Servs., No. 15-CV-1411 (JMF), 2016 WL 1267796, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. \nMar. 30, 2016) (application for review of USCIS’s denial of an adjustment of status application \nwhere a favorable decision would require holding, “at least by implication,” that the removal \norder underlying USCIS’s denial was invalid), aff’d, 878 F.3d 441 (2d Cir. 2017), as amended \n(Jan. 9, 2018); Hu v. Holder, No. 11-CV-4747 (FB), 2012 WL 2619185 (E.D.N.Y. June 25, 2012) \n(petition to compel USCIS to adjudicate an application for permanent residency after the filing of \nseveral unsuccessful motions to reopen a removal order); Nieto-Ayala v. Holder, No. 08-CV-\n8347 (LMM), 2011 WL 3918156 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 30, 2011) (mandamus action to compel the \nGovernment to extend bond until USCIS adjudicated the asylum application of a petitioner who \nwas subject to a final removal order).  Barros Anguisica v. Decker, No. 18-CV-7493 (PAE), 2019 \nWL 3244122 (S.D.N.Y. July 9, 2019), a recent decision by Judge Engelmayer, is particularly \ninstructive here.  That case, like this one, involved a due process challenge to an “attempt to \nremove [a petitioner] pursuant to an allegedly defective NTA.”  Id. at *3.  The petitioner sought \nto stay his scheduled removal until after the BIA decided his then-pending motion to reopen the \n5 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-06443-JMF   Document 48   Filed 09/05/19   Page 6 of 10\nremoval order.  The petition, he argued, did not constitute a challenge to the removal order itself \nbecause the relief it sought would afford him only “a meaningful opportunity for his motion to \nreopen . . . to be heard by the BIA and not be deported” in the interim.  Barros Anguisaca, 2019 \nWL 3244122, at *5.  Relying on Delgado, Judge Engelmayer rejected that argument, reasoning \nthat the petitioner’s claim indirectly challenged his removal order by implying that the \nimmigration court that issued it despite notice defects had done so unlawfully.  Id.  \nDelgado compels the same result here.  Plaintiffs’ Complaint and opposition brief are \nboth littered with assertions that the challenged in absentia removal orders were issued in \nviolation of a statute and/or the Constitution, “were not properly entered,” or are otherwise \n“unlawful.”  See, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 1, 3, 6, 7; Opp’n at 3, 13, 20.  It follows that while Plaintiffs \nmay presently seek only an order entitling unrepresented immigrants to a hearing, see id. at 1, \ntheir “ultimate goal” is to challenge the lawfulness of the removal orders themselves, Delgado, \n643 F.3d at 55.  Put differently, the relief that Plaintiffs seek is a “necessary prerequisite” to any \nadministrative challenge to the removal orders.  Id.; see Opp’n at 1 (arguing that relief is \nnecessary because unrepresented immigrants “cannot file a motion to reopen”); id. at 8.  If the \nCourt grants Plaintiffs the relief that they seek — among other things, an order that has the effect \nof temporarily barring the Government from acting on certain in absentia removal orders — \n“then the Government would be without a mechanism to enforce the removal order[s]” at least \nuntil it can schedule future hearings.  Barros Anguisaca, 2019 WL 3244122, at *5; see Freire v. \nU.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 711 F. App’x 58, 59 (2d Cir. 2018) (summary order) (reaffirming \nthat Section 1252(a)(5) “removes jurisdiction from the district courts over any challenge [to] the \ndenial of an application for status adjustment of a party who is already subject to a removal \norder, if the relief requested in the challenge would invalidate the order”).  It follows that, in \n6 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-06443-JMF   Document 48   Filed 09/05/19   Page 7 of 10\nsubstance if not form, Plaintiffs challenge the underlying removal orders.  Under Delgado, that \nmeans that this Court lacks jurisdiction to hear their claims. \nIn arguing otherwise, Plaintiffs rely heavily on the Supreme Court’s decision last year in \nJennings v. Rodriguez, 138 S. Ct. 830 (2018).  See Opp’n at 7-8 & n.5.  But that reliance is \nmisplaced.  In Jennings, the petitioner was seeking an individualized bond hearing pending the \ncompletion of removal proceedings.  Jennings, 138 S. Ct. at 838-39.  A plurality wrote to \nindependently confirm the Court’s jurisdiction to entertain the underlying claims, given, among \nother things, Section 1252(b)(9)’s limitation on judicial review of legal questions that “aris[e] \nfrom” removal orders.  Id. at 835, 839-40.  The plurality found that an immigrant’s challenge to \nthe length of his pre-removal detention — like a hypothetical challenge to an assault or other tort \nthat occurs while an immigrant is detained — cannot fairly be said to “aris[e] from” actions \ntaken to remove him.  Id. at 840.  The plurality explained that “cramming judicial review” of \nsuch tangentially related questions “into the review of final removal orders” would be an \n“absurd” exercise of “uncritical literalism,” and that to do so would be to “make claims of \nprolonged detention,” which necessarily involve harms that end before the entry of a final order, \n“effectively unreviewable.”  Id.  But that reasoning does not preclude the application of Section \n1252(b)(9) (or for that matter, Section 1252(a)(5)) to this case, where Plaintiffs seek to \ntemporarily bar the Government from executing removal orders that it has already obtained, as \nsuch relief arises from the removal orders themselves.  And in any event, the Jennings plurality \nexplicitly declined to outline “the scope of § 1252(b)(9),” reasoning instead that no jurisdictional \nbar existed where a petitioner was “not asking for review of an order of removal . . . [and was] \nnot even challenging any part of the process by which [his] removability [would] be \n7 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-06443-JMF   Document 48   Filed 09/05/19   Page 8 of 10\ndetermined.”  Id. at 841.  Here, by asking the Court to force the Government to hold a hearing to \nconsider whether final orders of removal were lawfully entered, Plaintiffs do both.   \nThe other cases on which Plaintiffs rely are distinguishable or unpersuasive (or both) and, \nin any event, are not binding on this Court.  In Singh v. Gonzales, 499 F.3d 969 (9th Cir. 2007), \nfor example, the Ninth Circuit held that, “[b]y virtue of their explicit language, both §§ \n1252(a)(5) and 1252(b)(9) apply only to those claims seeking judicial review of orders of \nremoval.”  Id. at 978.  As discussed above, however, the claims in this case do just that, albeit \nindirectly.  And whatever Singh may say about an indirect challenge to an order of removal, this \nCourt is bound by the Second Circuit’s holding in Delgado that Sections 1252(a)(5) and \n1252(b)(9) bar direct and indirect challenges alike.  For similar reasons, the Court may not and \ndoes not follow Chhoeun v. Marin, No. SACV-17-01898 (CJC), 2018 WL 1941756 (C.D. Cal. \nMar. 26, 2018), which held that Sections 1252(a)(5), 1252(b)(9), and 1252(g) “narrowly . . . \npreclude district courts’ jurisdiction only where the claim challenges the Attorney General’s \ndiscrete acts of commencing proceedings, adjudicating cases, and executing removal orders.”  Id. \nat *4 (internal quotation marks omitted).  That may or may not be the law in the Ninth Circuit; \nbut it is not the law in this Circuit.  Finally, the Court is not swayed by Plaintiffs’ invocation of \nCalderon v. Sessions, 330 F. Supp. 3d 944 (S.D.N.Y. 2018).  For one thing, the petitioner there — \nunlike Plaintiffs here, see, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 1, 3, 6, 7; Opp’n at 3, 13, 20 — conceded “that the \norder of removal against him [was] valid and enforceable.” Id. at 955; see also id. (citing \ncounsel’s statement that “we are not challenging the underlying order of removal”); id. at 956 \n(noting that petitioner does not “claim . . . a right to remain in the United States.”).  For another, \nas another court observed, the holding in Calderon ultimately seems to rest on “the fiction” that \nthe petitioner there was “not challenging the execution of [his] removal order[] by seeking to \n8 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-06443-JMF   Document 48   Filed 09/05/19   Page 9 of 10\nstay” it.  Ashqar v. Hott, No. 19-CV-716 (TSE), 2019 WL 2712276, at *4 (E.D. Va. June 5, \n2019).  The Court is unable (and unwilling) to indulge in that fiction here. \nThat leaves Plaintiffs’ alternative argument: that interpreting Sections 1252(a)(5) and \n(b)(9) to mean that this Court lacks jurisdiction would violate the Suspension Clause.  See Opp’n \nat 14.  That argument can be swiftly rejected.  The Suspension Clause provides that “[t]he \nPrivilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of \nRebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.”  U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 2.  But this is \nnot a habeas corpus case; it is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief brought by \norganizational plaintiffs not subject to governmental custody.  And, in any event, as Plaintiffs \nthemselves acknowledge, the REAL ID Act does not “suspend” the ability of anyone in custody \nto seek relief; it merely “channel[s] judicial review” into the courts of appeals by way of a \npetition for review.  Opp’n at 1.  The Second Circuit has held that that mechanism is an adequate \nsubstitute for the writ of habeas corpus.  See Luna v. Holder, 637 F.3d 85 (2d Cir. 2011).  And \nmore broadly, courts have almost uniformly rejected Suspension Clause challenges to the REAL \nID Act on that ground.  See, e.g., Muka v. Baker, 559 F.3d 480, 484-85 (6th Cir. 2009); Ruiz-\nMartinez v. Mukasey, 516 F.3d 102, 114 (2d Cir. 2008); Iasu v. Smith, 511 F.3d 881, 887-88 (9th \nCir. 2007); Mohamed v. Gonzales, 477 F.3d 522, 526 (8th Cir. 2007); Alexandre v. U.S. Attorney \nGen., 452 F.3d 1204, 1206 (11th Cir. 2006); Barros Anguisaca, 2019 WL 3244122, at *5-7.  But \nsee Gonzalez-Alarcon v. Macias, 884 F.3d 1266, 1276-78 (10th Cir. 2018). \nCONCLUSION \nIf true (and the Court has assumed that they are true for purposes of this motion), \nPlaintiffs’ allegations are certainly troubling.  According to the Complaint, unrepresented \nimmigrant families and children find themselves in “a classic Catch-22 situation”: having been \n9 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-06443-JMF   Document 48   Filed 09/05/19   Page 10 of 10\ndeprived of notice and the opportunity to challenge entry of removal orders in the first instance, \nthe only way they can challenge those orders now is by filing written motions to reopen.  Opp’n \nat 1; see Compl. ¶¶ 3-6.  But without counsel, English fluency, or an ability to navigate the \ncomplex immigration system, they realistically “cannot file written motions to reopen to bring \nthose failures [in notice] to light.”  Opp’n at 1.  In light of Sections 1252(a)(5) and (b)(9), \nhowever, any remedy for these circumstances lies not in this Court, but elsewhere: in \nimmigration court (by way of a motion to reopen), in the Court of Appeals (by way of a petition \nfor review), or in Congress (by way of changing the law).  Accordingly, and for the foregoing \nreasons, Defendants’ motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction is GRANTED and \nthe Complaint is dismissed.1 \nThe Clerk of Court is directed to terminate ECF No. 39 and to close the case. \n \n  SO ORDERED. \n   \nDated: September 5, 2019            __________________________________ \n  New York, New York         JESSE M.

Plaintiffs are several organizations that serve immigrant families and children \nwho fled persecution or torture in their home countries. They seek to prevent imminent \ndeportations in violation of the most basic due process principles: the rights to notice and an \nopportunity to be heard. The families and children whom Plaintiffs serve fled their countries \nwithin the last five years. But none of them ever had their claims for asylum and related relief \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-06443-JMF   Document 1   Filed 07/11/19   Page 2 of 44\nheard by an immigration judge. Instead, the government ordered them removed in absentia \nbecause they failed to appear in court.  \n2.  Upon information and belief, the Trump Administration will soon arrest en masse \nthousands of these families and children – most of them from El Salvador, Guatemala, and \nHonduras. Specifically, Mark Morgan, Acting Director of ICE, announced on June 19, 2019 that \nthe upcoming mass arrests would include among its targets 2,000 families who recently arrived \nand were ordered deported in absentia. \n3.  The in absentia removal orders the Trump Administration now seeks to enforce \nwere not properly entered because the government’s system for providing notice is in chaos. In \nthousands of cases, the government mailed notices to incorrect addresses; sent them with no date \nor time; and set hearings for dates – including weekends – when no hearings were being held at \nall.  \n4.  Even when the government sent notices to the right address for a real hearing, it \nrepeatedly sent them too late, for locations unreasonably far from immigrants’ homes. Notices \nthus arrived either after the date set for a hearing or just a few days before, requiring indigent \nfamilies to immediately travel across the country to hearings in distant states.  \n5.  The government also entered thousands of in absentia orders against children, \neven though those children obviously had no control over whether they appeared in court.  \n6.  Defendants will contend that any individual improperly ordered removed in \nabsentia can and must file a written “motion to reopen” to establish their removal order was \nentered in error. But that procedure is effectively unavailable for unrepresented families and \nchildren. Such individuals are unable to write in English a document satisfying the complex \nprocedural requirements applicable to motions to reopen.  \n7.  The unrepresented families and children ordered removed in absentia through \nthese deficient procedures did not receive proper notice, are unable to file a motion to reopen, \nand could suffer serious harm if deported. The Due Process Clause and the refugee protection \nlaws therefore require that these individuals have an opportunity, before they are deported, to \n-2- \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-06443-JMF   Document 1   Filed 07/11/19   Page 3 of 44\nappear before an immigration judge, where the judge can speak to them to determine whether \nrescission of their order is warranted.  \n8.  Unless this Court enforces that requirement, thousands of individuals could be \ndeported without ever receiving a fair opportunity to appear before a judge, as required by the \nDue Process Clause and the immigration laws.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n9.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1331, which \nconfers jurisdiction to consider federal questions.1  \n10.  This Court may grant relief under 28 U.S.C. 1331 (federal question), 28 U.S.C. \n1651 (All Writs Act), 5 U.S.C. 702 and 706 (Administrative Procedure Act), 28 U.S.C. 2201 and \n2202 (Declaratory Judgment Act), and Fed. R. Civ. P. 65 (injunctive relief). Defendants do not \nhave sovereign immunity for claims seeking injunctive relief for constitutional violations, see Ex \nParte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908). In any event, the government has waived any such immunity. \n5 U.S.C. 702. \n11.  Venue is proper in the Southern District of New York under 28 U.S.C. 1391 \nbecause Defendants are officers or employees of the United States and a Plaintiff resides in this \nDistrict, see 28 U.S.C. 1391(e)(1)(C); because a substantial part of the events giving rise to the \nclaims in this action took place in this District, see 28 U.S.C. 1391(e)(1)(B); and because a \nDefendant resides in this District, see 28 U.S.C. 1391(e)(1)(A).2  \n                                                 \n1 The Due Process Clause and Article III of the U.S. Constitution also require some federal \nforum for judicial review of federal statutory and constitutional claims like those at issue here. \n2 The Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at Syracuse University obtains data \non various aspects of the immigration court process from the Executive Office of Immigration \nReview. Based on its analysis, more than 5,000 unrepresented children have been ordered \ndeported in absentia in New York since 2014. See Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse \nImmigration, Juveniles – Immigration Court Deportation Proceedings (last visited July 9, 2019), \nhttps://trac.syr.edu/phptools/immigration/juvenile/. While data about family units from the last \ntwo years is limited, more than 800 unrepresented people in family units were ordered removed \nin absentia in New York from fiscal years 2014 to 2017.

The Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project (“ASAP”) was founded in 2015 and has \nbeen fiscally sponsored by the Urban Justice Center, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. It is \nincorporated in New York and its office is located in New York City (within the Southern \nDistrict).  \n13.  ASAP aims to prevent the wrongful deportation of families seeking asylum and \notherwise vindicate their rights. To achieve this goal, ASAP provides legal representation and \nrelated forms of assistance to individuals who have sought asylum at the Mexico-U.S. border, \nregardless of where they are currently located.  \n14.  ASAP’s work has focused on serving families who have little or no access to \ntraditional legal service providers, including in rural places and less resourced states. Most of \nASAP’s clients thus far have been individuals whom the government initially detained in border \ndetention centers. \n15.  ASAP attorneys and support staff typically work remotely to represent asylum-\nseeking families who are facing deportation. \n16.  CARECEN-Los Angeles (hereinafter “CARECEN”) was founded in 1986 to \naddress the needs of Salvadorans and other Central Americans who fled the region amid the civil \nwars, political repression, and counter-insurgencies of the 1980s. CARECEN focuses on \nproviding immigration legal services and advocacy and also seeks to advance health and \nwellness and family support for immigrants. Its mission is to provide direct services and engage \nin community development and advocacy to help create a thriving Latino immigrant community.   \n17.  CARECEN’s attorneys have provided, inter alia, free legal assistance to \nimmigrants, including to immigrants subject to in absentia removal orders, and have filed \nmotions to reopen on behalf of such immigrants. CARECEN offers immigrant communities free \nknow-your-rights training, addressing, inter alia, removal proceedings, in absentia orders, and \nmotions to reopen. CARECEN also engages in community development and advocacy regarding \nimmigration issues.   \n-4- \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-06443-JMF   Document 1   Filed 07/11/19   Page 5 of 44\n18.  Immigrant Defenders Law Center (“ImmDef”), founded in 2015, is one of the \nlargest nonprofit providers of deportation defense in California. ImmDef’s mission is to provide \naccess to counsel to all indigent immigrants in deportation proceedings and defend immigrant \ncommunities from systemic injustices within the legal system. ImmDef focuses on representing \nthe most vulnerable populations in removal proceedings, including unaccompanied children and \nyouth who arrive alone in the United States and face deportation, adults with mental-health \nchallenges, and lawful permanent residents facing deportation due to unlawful conviction. \n19.  ImmDef attorneys have provided, inter alia, free legal assistance to immigrant \nchildren, including to immigrants subject to in absentia removal orders, and have filed motions \nto reopen on their behalf. Through its Detained Youth Empowerment Project, which provides \nknow-your-rights classes and legal screenings for all children detained in shelters in the greater \nLos Angeles area, ImmDef also works to educate children about the immigration system. \nImmDef engages in advocacy with lawmakers at the local, state, and federal level, with the goal \nof furthering universal representation and establishing a public-defender system for immigrants.  \n20.  Public Counsel was founded in 1970 and is the largest pro bono law firm in the \nnation. Its activities are far-ranging and affect a wide spectrum of people who live at or below \nthe poverty line. Public Counsel’s mission is, in part, to protect the legal rights of disadvantaged \nchildren; to represent immigrants who have been the victims of torture, persecution, domestic \nviolence, trafficking, and other crimes; and to foster economic justice by providing individuals \nand institutions in underserved communities with access to quality legal representation.  \n21.  Public Counsel’s attorneys have provided, inter alia, free legal assistance to \nimmigrants in removal proceedings, including immigrants subject to in absentia removal orders, \nand have filed motions to reopen on behalf of such immigrants.  \n22.  Public Counsel also participates in coalitions that seek to influence immigration \npolicy. For instance, in 2015, Public Counsel was a signatory on a letter to President Barack \nObama opposing reported DHS plans to conduct immigration raids to round up and deport \nCentral American children and their parents.  \n-5- \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-06443-JMF   Document 1   Filed 07/11/19   Page 6 of 44\n23.  Defendant William Barr is the Attorney General of the United States, the most \nsenior official in the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”). He has the authority to interpret the \nimmigration laws and adjudicate removal cases. The Attorney General delegates this \nresponsibility to the Executive Office for Immigration Review (“EOIR”), which administers the \nimmigration courts and the Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”). He is named in his official \ncapacity. \n24.  Defendant James McHenry is the Director of EOIR, the agency within DOJ \nresponsible for the immigration courts and the BIA. He is named in his official capacity. \n25.  Defendant Kevin McAleenan is the Acting Secretary of the U.S. Department of \nHomeland Security (“DHS”), an agency of the United States. He is named in his official \ncapacity. \n26.  Defendant Mark Morgan is the Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement (“ICE”). ICE is responsible for the apprehension, detention, and removal of \nnoncitizens from the United States. He is named in his official capacity.  \n27.  Defendant Thomas R. Decker is the Director of the New York Field Office for \nICE, a component of DHS. Mr. Decker has custody of immigrants subject to in absentia orders \nafter their apprehension within the jurisdiction of the New York Field Office. He is named in his \nofficial capacity. \n \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nFamilies and Children Fleeing Violence  \n28.  The number of people fleeing persecution who sought refuge in the United States \nbegan to increase significantly in 2014. In particular, a large number of people began to flee \nviolence in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. Between 2015 and 2017, the number of \npeople from those countries requesting asylum in the immigration courts increased 258%. The \n-6- \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-06443-JMF   Document 1   Filed 07/11/19   Page 7 of 44\nnumber decreased somewhat in 2018, but early evidence suggests the number of people fleeing \nthose countries has increased again in 2019.3  \n29.  Since 2014, a significant percentage of people fleeing persecution have come \neither as families or as unaccompanied children.4 The percentage of all those apprehended at the \nSouthwest border who arrived as families or unaccompanied children increased from 10% of the \ntotal number of individuals in 2012, to 66% in the period from October 2018 to May 2019.5 A \ntotal of 65,691 adults and children had their cases processed as “family unit” cases between \nSeptember 2018 and May 2019 in ten immigration court locations (while other families did not \nhave their cases processed as “family units”).6 \n30.  Many of the families and unaccompanied children who have sought refuge here \nfled persecution, torture, or death at the hands of their governments, transnational gangs, or their \nown family members. Many migrant children have also been raped, kidnapped, abandoned, or \nphysically abused in their home countries or by smugglers during their journey to the United \nStates.  \n                                                 \n3 Miriam Jordan, More Migrants Are Crossing the Border This Year. What’s Changed? New \nYork Times (March 5, 2019) (268,044 migrants detained in the first five months of this fiscal \nyear, including 136,150 people arriving in families with children). \n4 For purposes of this complaint, “families” refers to individuals who were part of a family unit \nat the time of their apprehension or when their cases were processed by the immigration courts. \n“Unaccompanied children” or “children” similarly refers to people under 18 who were \nunaccompanied by their parents at the time of their apprehension or when their cases were \nprocessed.  \n5 U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Southwest Border Migration, \nhttps://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/sw-border-migration (last visited June 19, 2019).

In response to the increase in families and children fleeing their countries of \norigin, since 2014 the government has consistently processed the deportation cases of these \nfamilies and children on an extremely expedited basis, in a chaotic and disorganized manner. \nMassive errors in the implementation of these so-called “rocket dockets” have resulted in \nwidespread failures to provide adequate notice in thousands of cases. Many of these errors were \nlikely accidental, but others were at least reckless and in some cases intentional. \n32.  In the summer of 2014, the Obama Administration “prioritized” the deportation \ncases of families and children seeking asylum for expedited processing in the immigration court \nsystem. Immigration courts shifted their resources and altered their case management practices to \nresolve these deportation cases swiftly by creating rocket dockets to adjudicate them quickly.7 \nHigh-level administration officials endorsed this plan and also signaled their intention to deport \nthe families and children subject to the rocket dockets. As then-Vice President Joe Biden stated, \n“the Department of Justice, Homeland Security . . . are enhancing the enforcement and removal \nproceedings because those who are pondering risking their lives to reach the United States \nshould be aware of what awaits them. It will not be open arms. . . . [W]e’re going to send the vast \nmajority of you back.” Press Release, Vice President Joe Biden, Office of the Vice President, \nRemarks to the Press with Q&A in Guatemala (Jun. 20, 2014). \n33.  From the outset, the rocket dockets produced widespread notice failures. For \nexample, Plaintiffs and other legal service providers saw instances of immigrant families and \nchildren receiving hearing notices fewer than 10 days before their hearing date, contrary to the \nrequirements of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), 8 U.S.C. 1229(b)(1), and in many \ninstances after the scheduled hearing. In other instances people never received notices because \n                                                 \n7 See Press Release, U.S. Department of Justice, Department of Justice Announces New \nPriorities to Address Surge of Migrants Crossing into the U.S. (Jul. 9, 2014); see also \nMemorandum from Brian M. O’Leary, Chief Immigration Judge, Executive Office for \nImmigration Review, to All Immigration Judges (Sept. 10, 2014). \n-8- \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-06443-JMF   Document 1   Filed 07/11/19   Page 9 of 44\ncourt staff incorrectly entered addresses or because, for other reasons, the addresses on file with \nEOIR did not match the addresses provided to the government by immigrants or their sponsors.8 \nIn either case, the result was that notices were sent to the wrong addresses through no fault of the \nimmigrants. \n34.  When thousands of unrepresented families failed to appear for their immigration \ncourt hearings, immigration judges consistently ordered them removed in absentia. The courts \nentered the in absentia removal orders in such cases against all the family members in such \nproceedings, including the children. \n35.  Similarly, when thousands of unrepresented unaccompanied children failed to \nappear for their hearings, the judges consistently ordered them removed. They did so despite the \nfact that—whether or not the adults involved had received proper notice—the children \nthemselves had no control over whether or not they appeared in court.  \n36.  The severity of these early problems caused by the rocket docket led dozens of \nlegal-service providers to write the Obama Administration in February 2015, asking that it fix \nthose problems: “Legal service providers, social service providers, and immigration advocates \nthat work with children in removal proceedings have received numerous reports . . . of \nsignificant numbers of children who have either received defective notice of their removal \n                                                 \n8 See Kate Linthicum, 7,000 Immigrant Children Ordered Deported Without Going to Court, \nL.A.

Yet immigration \ncourts have issued and continue to issue numerous in absentia removal orders against such \nchildren, including those without legal representation.” See Letter of February 9, 2015 from \nAmerican Friends Service Committee, et al., to Juan Osuna, et al. (attached as Exhibit A).9  \n37.   Despite this letter and other efforts to bring these issues to the attention of the \ngovernment, the problems with defective notices continued. Although the government modified \nthe expedited processing system in March 2015, the modifications had no effect on either the \nexcessive speed with which cases were scheduled or the immigration judges’ practice of ordering \nthat those who did not appear be removed.  \n38.  The Trump Administration’s policies and practices have severely exacerbated \nthese problems. The Trump Administration adopted its own version of the rocket dockets, \nresulting in predictable chaos. In January 2017, the Executive Office for Immigration Review set \nnew case priorities revising docketing practices. Among those designated as the highest \nprocessing priority were unaccompanied children in government custody.  \n39.  The following year, the Trump Administration instructed that cases of family \nunits would be docketed expeditiously as well, so that they could be processed within one year. \nAlthough the Administration acknowledged that the previous family unit processing priority had \nfailed, it asserted its new policy targeting family units would succeed. \n40.  Thus, chaotic docketing practices have continued unabated in the last two years, \nresulting in the same or worse notice problems. For example, in 2018, ICE knowingly issued \nthousands of Notices to Appear for dates on which immigration courts had not actually \nscheduled hearings. In some cases these purported notices listed weekend dates, or dates that do \nnot exist, such as September 31. In hundreds of cases, applicants arrived for hearings to find long \nlines, only to learn that they were not in fact scheduled for a hearing on that day.  \n                                                 \n9 This letter traced the beginning of these problems to a charging practice that apparently began \naround May 24, 2014. A similar letter written by the New York Civil Liberties Union to the \nChief Immigration Judge in New York suggested it could have begun as early as May 1, 2014. \n(attached as Exhibit B). \n-10- \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-06443-JMF   Document 1   Filed 07/11/19   Page 11 of 44\n41.  In other cases, immigration enforcement officials served the Notice to Appear in \nperson or at the correct address, but did not file it in court until long afterward. Individuals \nwhose addresses changed after receiving such Notices to Appear had no mechanism to change \ntheir address with the immigration courts while awaiting their hearing date, because their cases \nwere not yet in the court system.  \n42.  Other notices were sent with no date and time, or in other cases with no location. \nThe government had itself argued in briefing to the Supreme Court that the immigration statute \ndoes not permit courts to order that an individual to be ordered removed in absentia on the basis \nof a Notice to Appear issued without a date and time, Pereira v. Sessions, 138 S. Ct. 2105, 2118 \n(2018) (citing 8 U.S.C. 1229a(b)(5)(A) and (b)(5)(C)(ii)), but immigration judges issued \nthousands of such in absentia orders anyway.  \n43.  As of the end of May 2019, a detailed analysis of court records found nearly \n10,000 “phantom” family cases, meaning that the record contained a case number but did not \ninclude the date of the Notice to Appear, its filing date, the charges alleged, or any further details \nabout the family. In other cases, court records left address fields blank, or the addresses \ncontained transcription errors, such as ZIP codes that did not exist or that corresponded to a city \ndifferent from the one listed. Overall, in 83% of the cases decided in absentia, not even the initial \nscheduling hearing ever took place.10  \n44.  A different analysis conducted by the Department of Justice itself focused on one \nimmigration court. Based on this analysis, the department admitted that court staff failed to \nprocess or send out many change-of-address forms: “Poor management of this core process . . . \ncan result in respondents being ordered removed in absentia through no fault of their own.”11  \n45.  At the same time that the Trump Administration failed to provide proper notice in \nthousands of cases, the Attorney General directed immigration judges to grant fewer \n                                                 \n10 Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse Immigration, Most Released Families Attend \nImmigration Court Hearings (June 18, 2019) https://trac.syr.edu/immigration/reports/562/. \n11 Ani Ucar, Leaked Report Shows the Utter Dysfunction of Baltimore’s Immigration Court, \nVICE NEWS, Oct. 3, 2018, https://news.vice.com/en us/article/xw94ea/leaked-report-shows-the-\nutter-dysfunction-of-baltimores-immigration-court (last visited June 21, 2019).  \n-11- \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-06443-JMF   Document 1   Filed 07/11/19   Page 12 of 44\ncontinuances.

EOIR also implemented \nperformance metrics for immigration judges, requiring them to complete 700 cases per year. \nThese measures exacerbated the pressure on already overburdened immigration judges to resolve \ncases very quickly, thereby increasing the number of unjustified in absentia orders. \n46.  As a result, for the last five years, immigration judges have issued in absentia \nremoval orders for tens of thousands of unrepresented families and children who never had a fair \nopportunity to appear in court.12  \n47.  From fiscal years 2014 to 2017, 35,461 unrepresented “adults with children” (i.e., \nfamilies) and 39,027 unrepresented “unaccompanied children” were ordered removed in absentia \nunder the Obama-era rocket dockets. Nearly 90% of all removal orders entered against \nunrepresented families during that period were in absentia orders. Similarly, about 90% of the \nremoval orders against unrepresented children during that period were entered in absentia.13  \n                                                 \n12 Manuel Madrid, Miami’s Immigration Court Has Become a Well-Oiled Deportation Machine, \nNew Data Shows, MIAMI NEW TIMES, June 27, 2019, \nhttps://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/miamis-immigration-court-issues-deportation-orders-\nfor-thousands-of-families-11204731?fbclid=IwAR0aPr8Z8xn_I953xORMEp28CG9zuKH6j1-\nnEeO9nJw0cQXfdjvDxaKZ8Cs (last visited July 2, 2019); see also Timothy Bella, An 11-year-\nold girl could be deported because of a court error triggered by the government shutdown, \nattorney says, THE WASHINGTON POST, April 12, 2019, \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/04/12/i-dont-want-be-taken-away-my-mom-an-\nyear-old-girl-could-be-deported-without-her-family/?utm_term=.df0d0075a719 (last visited June \n19, 2019).  \n13 Publicly available data from the “adults with children” docket covers the period from \napproximately the summer of 2014 through April 2017.

See Transactional \nRecords Access Clearinghouse Immigration, Priority Immigration Court Cases: Women with \nChildren (last visited July 9, 2019) (approximately 88% of all removal orders against \nunrepresented “adults with children” on the “adults with children” docket were ordered removed \nin absentia), http://trac.syr.edu/phptools/immigration/mwc/; Transactional Records Access \nClearinghouse Immigration, Juveniles—Immigration Court Deportation Proceedings (last visited \nJuly 9, 2019) (approximately 90% of all removal orders against unrepresented “juveniles” were \nin absentia), http://trac.syr.edu/phptools/immigration/juvenile/.  \n-12- \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-06443-JMF   Document 1   Filed 07/11/19   Page 13 of 44\n48.  Under the Trump Administration, Department of Justice statistics show that, as of \nJune 2019, 12,784 “family units” have been ordered removed in its rocket dockets. 85% of those \nremoval orders were entered in absentia.14 Data on unaccompanied children is harder to obtain \ndue to the effects of the Trump Administration’s family-separation policy, but available data \nsuggests nearly 30,000 unrepresented children have been ordered removed in absentia since \n2018.15 \n49.  Thus, there are now tens of thousands of families and children living in the United \nStates with in absentia removal orders who never had a fair opportunity to appear in court.  \nIn Absentia Orders and The Inadequacy of the Motion to Reopen Mechanism \n50.  The immigration statutes permit immigration judges to order individuals removed \nin absentia if they fail to appear, but only if the judge finds both that they received proper notice \nof the date and time of the hearing and are removable. 8 U.S.C. 1229(a)(1). See also 8 U.S.C. \n1229(a)(2) (requiring additional notice where time or place of proceedings changes).  \n51.  At the removal hearing, DHS must establish “by clear, unequivocal, and \nconvincing evidence” both that it complied with its notice obligations and that the non-citizen is \nremovable. 8 U.S.C. 1229a(b)(5)(A); 8 C.F.R. 1003.26. Unlike in at least some other legal \nsystems, however, written notice is considered sufficient not only if it is “provided to the alien or \nthe alien’s counsel of record,” but also if it is provided at the non-citizen’s most recent address \non file. 8 U.S.C. 1229a(b)(5)(A). In other words, if a DHS prosecutor can show that the agency \nprovided notice to that address, an Immigration Judge can proceed in absentia, whether or not \nthe non-citizen ever received the notice or was actually even living there. Moreover, the agency \ntreats removability as established by evidence that the non-citizen had no pre-existing \nauthorization to enter or remain in the United States. DHS need not show ineligibility for asylum \nin order to establish removability. \n                                                 \n14 Executive Office for Immigration Review Adjudication Statistics: “Family Unit” Data for \nSelect Courts (available at https://www.justice.gov/eoir/file/1174141/download).  \n15 See supra n. 13 [[Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse Immigration, Juveniles—\nImmigration Court Deportation Proceedings (last visited July 9, 2017) \nhttps://trac.syr.edu/phptools/immigration/juvenile/.]]  \n-13- \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-06443-JMF   Document 1   Filed 07/11/19   Page 14 of 44\n52.  Nonetheless, the government treats an in absentia order as final and enforceable \nwith no further process. When ICE enforcement officers encounter an individual with an in \nabsentia order, they can arrest and deport that individual in a matter of days or even hours. \nIndividuals ordered removed in absentia are provided no opportunity to appear before a judge, to \nappeal, or to any other process. Under current agency practice, the only way for an individual \nfacing imminent deportation pursuant to an in absentia order to obtain relief from that order is to \nfile a written motion to reopen. 8 C.F.R. 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).  \n53.  The statute permits rescission of in absentia orders if notice was defective, upon a \nshowing of exceptional circumstances, or for certain other reasons. See generally 8 U.S.C. \n1229a(b)(5)(c).16 As noted above, however, the only mechanism the agency recognizes to permit \nsomeone to raise those arguments is for them to file a written motion.  \n54.  For represented individuals, this written motion can serve as an important \nmechanism for addressing the due process failures described above. Immigration judges \nroutinely have granted motions to reopen filed by Plaintiffs and other legal-service providers for \nfamilies and children they represent—based on notice failures, service defects, the immigrant’s \nunderstandable inability to attend a hearing (including because he or she was a child at the time \nthe removal order issued), and other common deficiencies. Many of these reopened proceedings \nhave resulted in relief from deportation. \n55.  For example, Plaintiff Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project (ASAP), along with \nCatholic Legal Immigration Network, Inc., won all 46 of the cases in which they filed motions to \nreopen, the substantial majority without the need for any appeal. The top three reasons they \nfound for their clients’ failure to appear were (1) lack of any timely notice; (2) government errors \n                                                 \n16 Regulations and case law also recognize additional requirements for service in \nchildren’s cases. Service of a notice to appear “shall be made upon the person with whom . . . the \nminor resides” and “whenever possible, service shall also be made on the near relative, guardian, \ncommittee, or friend.” 8 C.F.R. 103.8(c)(2)(ii).  \n \n-14- \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-06443-JMF   Document 1   Filed 07/11/19   Page 15 of 44\nand omissions in the communication of notice information; and (3) physical, geographical, and \nlanguage barriers that prevented the client from attending the hearing.17   \n56.  As these results show, a very high percentage of families and children ordered \nremoved in absentia would have their motions to reopen granted, if they had the ability to \npresent them. \n57.  Immigrant families and children who do not receive legal assistance from \nPlaintiffs or other attorneys are, however, unable to file motions to reopen. Most of these \nimmigrants subject to in absentia orders speak limited if any English, and they lack the capacity \nto read, understand, and comply with the requirements for writing and filing a motion to reopen.  \n58.  These requirements are extremely complex. The immigration statute recognizes \nthree bases on which an immigration court can grant a motion to reopen an in absentia order. \nNon-citizens must demonstrate that they did not receive proper notice, that they were in federal \nor state custody and therefore failed to appear through no fault of their own, or that the non-\nappearance was due to “exceptional circumstances.” 8 U.S.C. 1229a(b)(5)(C). “Exceptional \ncircumstances” in this context is a term of art, which refers to circumstances “beyond the \ncontrol” of the immigrant, such as “battery or extreme cruelty” to the immigrant, “serious \nillness” of the immigrant, or “serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent,” but not \n“less compelling circumstances.” 8 U.S.C. 1229a(e)(1); see also 8 C.F.R. 1003.23(b)(iii)(A)(1). \nThe deadline for filing a motion to reopen differs based on the claim being raised. There is no \ndeadline for filing a motion to reopen based on alleged notice defects. 8 U.S.C. \n1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii). A motion based on exceptional circumstances must be filed within 180 days \nof the removal order, though that deadline is subject to tolling. 8 U.S.C. 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i). The \nstatute and BIA caselaw also recognize other bases for filing motions to reopen. See, e.g., 8 \nU.S.C. 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii) (changed country conditions).  \n                                                 \n17 Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project and the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, Inc., Denied a \nDay in Court: The Government’s Use of In Absentia Removal Orders Against Families Seeking \nAsylum (2018). At the time of publication, two of the 46 cases had not been granted, but since \npublication the motions in those two cases were also granted. \n-15- \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-06443-JMF   Document 1   Filed 07/11/19   Page 16 of 44\n59.  In addition, an individual seeking to file a motion to reopen an in absentia \nremoval order must generally review their immigration file (known as the “A-file” or, for court \nrecords, the “Record of Proceedings”) to determine what the record discloses regarding the \ngovernment’s attempt to provide notice. The government does not, however, provide individuals \nwith a copy of their A-file and Record of Proceedings at the time they are arrested pending \ndeportation.  \n60.  Under current agency practice, the government does not permit individuals to \nmake their motions to reopen orally before an immigration judge. Moreover, the government \ndoes not provide individuals with access to their A-files (the file containing all government \ndocuments related to their case) to prepare such motions. Indeed, it takes no steps to assist \nindividuals who lack the capacity to file on their own, even once they are detained pending \ndeportation. For these reasons, the motion-to-reopen process does not provide unrepresented \nindividuals facing imminent removal any meaningful opportunity to challenge defects in their in \nabsentia removal orders prior to deportation. \n \nPlaintiffs’ Attempts to Protect Immigrant Families and Children \n61.  Plaintiffs provide legal representation to many families and unaccompanied \nchildren. In addition, because the Plaintiff organizations lack the capacity to represent all (or \neven most) of the unrepresented families and children they encounter, they provide a range of \nlesser forms of legal assistance to many of the unrepresented families and children they serve.  \n62.  Plaintiffs have been, and will continue to be, harmed by the inadequacies of the \ncurrent motion-to-reopen process for unrepresented individuals. Those deficiencies force them to \ndivert resources away from their core services, thereby undermining their missions and impairing \ntheir activities. Each time raids against immigrants with existing in absentia orders occur, this \nharm is multiplied, as some or all Plaintiffs expend resources trying to identify the affected \nindividuals and, if possible, assist them in filing motions to reopen or otherwise countering the \ndefects in the motion-to-reopen process. Plaintiffs have also expended resources on community \n-16- \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-06443-JMF   Document 1   Filed 07/11/19   Page 17 of 44\neducational programs explaining in absentia removal orders and the risks they create and on \nadvocacy to ameliorate the harsh effects of the rocket dockets.  \n63.  In addition, the immediate deportation without a hearing of individuals with in \nabsentia orders, including those Plaintiffs seek to serve, prevents those individuals from gaining \naccess to the organizations’ core services. Although Plaintiffs assist individuals facing \ndeportation with prior in absentia orders to the extent possible, they are not able to help all of \ntheir constituents in such circumstances. \n64.  As described above, Plaintiff Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project (ASAP) has \nfocused its work on protecting families seeking asylum who face wrongful deportation.  \n65.  Although ASAP’s key mission is to assist families in obtaining asylum, a large \nportion of its limited representation resources have instead been spent litigating motions to \nreopen due to the constitutional deficiencies associated with in absentia orders. At the cost of not \nbeing able to provide its full complement of core services, ASAP has been forced to focus on \nchallenging in absentia orders because of the high rate of in absentia orders among families who \nfled persecution and the particular risk of immediate unlawful deportation that individuals with \nsuch orders face. Perhaps most important, pro bono resources—volunteer legal work by private \nlaw firms and attorneys—are very often unavailable to people with in absentia orders, because \nthe requirements for preparing and filing written motions to reopen are technically complex and \nthe work involved is far more than for other cases, thereby making those cases less attractive to \nprivate pro bono attorneys who are not immigration specialists. As a result of these factors, a \nlarge portion of ASAP’s direct representation has involved people who have been ordered \nremoved in absentia.  \n66.  If ASAP had not been compelled to expend these resources on in absentia orders, \nit would have directed them toward providing assistance to pro se individuals to file their asylum \napplications in immigration court or litigate appeals, placing cases with private attorneys to \nlitigate asylum hearings, and otherwise working to help people obtain asylum and other services \n-17- \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-06443-JMF   Document 1   Filed 07/11/19   Page 18 of 44\nin aid of families’ seeking refuge. Instead, however, it has had to spend an inordinate amount of \ntime and resources reopening cases just for people to get the chance to apply.  \n67.  ASAP could conduct its work far more efficiently if the government were \nrequired to present individuals ordered removed in absentia to immigration judges, with an \nopportunity to move orally to reopen their cases, prior to executing the removal orders. Among \nother benefits, such a system often would obviate the need to prepare and file written motions. \nWhile in some cases such motions might still be required to supplement oral presentations, the \nnumber of them would be greatly reduced and they could be more narrowly focused on the \nspecific issues that may have been identified in initial court proceedings. Such a system would \nalso permit ASAP to concentrate on its mission by assisting individuals in their asylum cases in \nimmigration court. \n68.  Plaintiff CARECEN-LA runs multiple core programs dedicated to ensure the \nlegal rights of Central American immigrants. Resources from each of those programs are \ndiverted to addressing the problems arising from the enforcement of in absentia orders against \nCentral American families. \n69.  CARECEN-LA has a large community-education program to inform its \nconstituents of the dangers arising from the immigration-enforcement system. That program \nutilizes “charlas”—community presentations convened at schools, consulates, CARECEN’s \noffices, and elsewhere—that provide basic but critical information concerning the immigration \nsystem. Because of the acute risk created by the possibility of immediate deportation arising \nfrom in absentia orders, the staff conducting charlas routinely include extensive information on \nhow someone can determine that they have an in absentia order, the risks associated with such \norders, and basic information about the motion-to-reopen process. \n70.  Through its charla programs, its office intake, and elsewhere, CARECEN-LA \nstaff routinely encounter unrepresented individuals ordered removed in absentia on the rocket \ndocket, including both families with children and children who came to this country alone. \nCARECEN-LA attorneys must work under intense time pressure to file motions to reopen in \n-18- \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-06443-JMF   Document 1   Filed 07/11/19   Page 19 of 44\nsuch cases, forcing them to change their work priorities to focus first on in absentia cases at the \nexpense of other, core services, because an individual who is arrested with a pre-existing in \nabsentia order faces immediate deportation without the opportunity to appear before a judge. \nCARECEN staff are forced to work much more quickly than they otherwise would to contact the \nindividual’s family members on an expedited basis, attempt to obtain the relevant documents \nfrom the A-file through extraordinary channels, and file a motion to reopen on an expedited \nbasis.  \n71.  Whenever there are increased enforcement actions against any particular \npopulation, such as Central American families and children who came in the last few years, \nCARECEN-LA’s office receives a corresponding increase in intakes and requests for \ninformation. These increases inundate the organization’s staff, thereby diverting them from \nperforming other work.  \n72.  Thus, at the expense of fully pursuing its core goals, CARECEN has been \ncompelled to devote significant portions of its limited resources to counteract the constitutionally \ninsufficient process afforded immigrants subject to in absentia removal orders, for instance by \nundertaking additional legal representations, outreach efforts, and advocacy. If CARECEN had \nnot been compelled to expend these resources, it would have directed them toward other efforts \nto advance immigrants’ rights and other abuses in the immigration-enforcement system. \n73.  In addition, funding for CARECEN’s asylum cases is based in part on the number \nof cases it handles per year and the number it anticipates serving. Because individuals with in \nabsentia orders face immediate deportation and require complex written motions to reopen just \nto get a hearing before a judge, CARECEN expends resources that could otherwise be devoted to \nmultiple other cases when it takes on a single in absentia case. That inefficiency has harmed \nCARECEN’s funding, because it reduces the total number of cases CARECEN can take on.  \n74.  Plaintiff Immigrant Defenders Law Center (ImmDef) also runs several programs \ndedicated to ensuring the legal rights of non-citizens facing deportation, including Central \nAmericans fleeing persecution. ImmDef provides education to community members, including \n-19- \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-06443-JMF   Document 1   Filed 07/11/19   Page 20 of 44\nmembers of the Central American refugee community, about the immigration-enforcement \nsystem. In that context, it must expend resources explaining in absentia removal orders and the \nparticular dangers arising from them, thereby preventing it from addressing other important \nimmigration-enforcement topics. \n75.  ImmDef attorneys also provide educational programs for dependency attorneys, \nhospitals, and other social service providers who come into contact with non-citizens, including \nCentral Americans who came here fleeing persecution. ImmDef’s attorneys often must focus on \nthe unique dangers associated with in absentia removal orders as part of those educational \nprograms, thereby displacing content about other important immigration-enforcement topics.  \n76.  In addition, ImmDef attorneys provide legal assistance and representation to \nevery detained child in the Los Angeles area, including the children detained in long-term foster \ncare facilities and any children held in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement. \nBecause some of those clients are released and subsequently ordered removed for failing to \nappear, ImmDef has former clients with in absentia removal orders. When its staff encounters \nthose individuals, they must work expeditiously to protect them because of the unique risk posed \nby the possibility of deportation without a hearing. The need to protect individuals with in \nabsentia orders thus displaces other immigration defense work.  \n77.  Accordingly, at the expense of fully pursuing its core goals, ImmDef has been \ncompelled to devote significant portions of its limited resources to counteract the constitutionally \ninsufficient process afforded immigrants subject to in absentia removal orders, for instance by \nundertaking additional legal representations, outreach efforts, and advocacy. If ImmDef had not \nbeen compelled to expend these resources, it would have directed them toward other efforts to \nrepresent individuals in immigration court and otherwise advance immigrants’ rights and combat \nother abuses in the immigration-enforcement system. \n78.  Plaintiff Public Counsel also runs several programs to protect the rights of \nimmigrants facing deportation, including people fleeing Central America. Public Counsel \nprovides know-your-rights trainings and individualized legal assistance to detained individuals, \n-20- \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-06443-JMF   Document 1   Filed 07/11/19   Page 21 of 44\nincluding those who are detained after having previously received in absentia removal orders. \nWhen they encounter such individuals, Public Counsel attorneys must prioritize assisting them \nby explaining the requirements for filing motions to reopen, and, in some cases, filing the \nmotions on their behalf. Because of the imminent threat of deportation in such cases, Public \nCounsel must divert immediate resources to them, at the expense of education other detainees in \nneed of advice and/or taking on representation in other cases. Motion to reopen work is \nsubstantial. It may involve contacting the detainee’s family members on an expedited basis, \nspeaking with local ICE authorities or detention center personnel, attempting to obtain the \nrelevant documents from the A-file through extraordinary channels, and assisting with the filing \nof a motion to reopen on an extremely expedited basis.  \n79.  Public Counsel has other programs that serve Central Americans fleeing \npersecution. For example, Public Counsel has several staff attorneys who represent children \nfacing removal. Those attorneys have represented people who entered the United States as \nunaccompanied children and were later ordered removed in absentia. In some cases those \nchildren have come to Public Counsel through the foster-care system, while in others they have \ncome through the adult-detainee population. Regardless of how the case arises, Public Counsel’s \nattorneys are forced to act more quickly in these cases in order to prevent execution of the in \nabsentia removal order before a judge has had the opportunity to examine the individual’s \ndefenses.  \n80.  Because of the risk that a large number of its constituents could be immediately \ndeported without a hearing, Public Counsel has been forced to expend resources on creating a \nnew program to train attorneys on screening individuals in advance of the technically complex \nprocesses for preparing and filing written motions to reopen. Public Counsel has had to divert \nnon-immigration attorneys from its other programs to receive training on and assist with \nhandling these screenings. Public Counsel also has had to educate the legal community and \nmembers of the immigrant community on how to learn of the existence of in absentia orders and \nwhat legal strategies exist for challenging such orders. Thus, at the expense of fully pursuing its \n-21- \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-06443-JMF   Document 1   Filed 07/11/19   Page 22 of 44\ncore goals, Public Counsel has been compelled to devote significant portions of its limited \nresources to counteract the constitutionally insufficient process afforded immigrants subject to in \nabsentia removal orders, for instance by undertaking additional legal representations, outreach \nefforts, and advocacy. If Public Counsel had not been compelled to expend these resources, it \nwould have directed them toward other efforts to advance immigrants’ rights and other abuses in \nthe immigration-enforcement system. \n81.  Each of these organizations also engages in public advocacy to inform immigrant \nfamilies and the general public about the risks associated with in absentia orders and to advocate \nagainst their use. For example, CARECEN-LA, ImmDef, and Public Counsel, along with other \ngroups, organized a press conference to protest the Obama Administration’s raids against Central \nAmerican refugees in January 2016.  \nImminent Deportations of Families and Children Subjected to the “Rocket Docket.” \n82.  While families and children who receive in absentia removal orders have been at \nrisk of deportation for years, the government has not consistently targeted them specifically in its \nenforcement efforts. The Obama Administration did so briefly in January 2016 and was heavily \ncriticized for doing so. See, e.g., Josh Gerstein and Seung Min Kim, Obama administration kicks \noff family deportation raids, Politico (Jan. 4, 2016), \nhttps://www.politico.com/story/2016/01/obama-family-deportation-raids-217329 (describing \nraids affecting several dozen people in January 2016).  \n83.  Upon information and belief, the situation has now changed. The President \nhimself tweeted on June 17, 2019, that “[n]ext week ICE will begin the process of removing the \nmillions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States.” Recent \nreports indicate that the President was referring to a plan to target families and children with in \nabsentia removal orders en masse. In addition, on June 19, 2019, Mark Morgan, Acting Director \nof ICE, announced the upcoming mass arrests would include among its targets 2,000 families \nwho recently arrived, were part of an expedited court process, failed to report for their hearing, \n-22- \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-06443-JMF   Document 1   Filed 07/11/19   Page 23 of 44\nand were ordered deported in early 2019. After a brief pause, on June 28, 2019 the President \nreiterated that ICE immigration raids would start in about a week, sometime after July 4.  \n84.  These reports are consistent with earlier ones suggesting the Administration first \nconsidered plans to target families and children subject to in absentia orders at least two years \nago. As reported in September 2017, “[t]he Trump administration is weighing a new policy that \nwould fast-track the deportation of thousands of Central American teenagers who arrived at the \nsouthern border, unaccompanied by adults. . . . This new policy would call for expedited \ndeportation of . . . the more than 150,000 children who arrived at the southern border alone, \nescaping violence and poverty in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. Under the plan being \ndiscussed . . . they would not see an immigration judge first.”18  \n85.  Upon information and belief, those plans were delayed by officials who thought \nthem too draconian, if not unlawful. Those officials are now gone.19  \nLEGAL BACKGROUND \n86.  The central legal injury that Plaintiffs face arises from the government’s view that \nit may use in absentia removal orders to summarily deport unrepresented families and children, \ndespite the massive notice deficiencies and other errors that infected thousands of those orders.  \n87.  The Constitution and immigration laws require that individuals facing deportation \nreceive hearings at which they can present their defenses. The Supreme Court held over one \nhundred years ago that the Fifth Amendment protects people facing deportation and therefore \nentitles them to notice, hearings, and other basic Due Process protections. Yamataya v. Fisher, \n189 U.S. 86 (1903).  \n88.  Immigration statutes codify that basic principle by providing a hearing and other \nprotections to all people in removal proceedings, including those who have a credible fear of \n                                                 \n18 See Franco Ordonez, Exclusive: Trump team drafting plan to deport more young people — \nCentral American teens, (Sept. 21, 2017), http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-\ngovernment/white-house/article174488221.html#storylink=cpy. \n19 Zolan Kanno-Youngs, In Shift, U.S. Vows to More Aggressively Deport Migrant Families, \nN.Y.

See generally 8 U.S.C. 1229a, 1225(b). Under these statutes and the Fifth \nAmendment, individuals in removal proceedings are entitled to “a full and fair hearing which \nprovides a meaningful opportunity to be heard.” Lin v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 453 F.3d 99, 104-\n105 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting Capric v. Ashcroft, 355 F.3d 1075, 1087 (7th Cir. 2004)).  \n89.  While, as noted above, the statute and agency regulations on their face permit the \ndeportation of individuals who failed to appear without further process, neither the Due Process \nClause nor the refugee-protection provisions of the immigration laws permit application of that \nrule to unrepresented families and children ordered deported in absentia since 2014. Thousands \nof people in that group certainly failed to appear through no fault of their own, lack the ability to \nfile a motion to reopen, and will face persecution or torture if returned to their home countries. \nUnder those conditions, the risk of erroneous deprivation arising from the imposition of a \nrequirement that they file a written motion to reopen before they can appear in court is \nintolerably high and therefore violates the Fifth Amendment and the immigration laws.  \n90.  Several courts have issued injunctions against ICE’s use of process-free mass \nremovals where particular populations were targeted for expedited enforcement, in order to \nprovide such individuals meaningful access to procedures needed to seek immigration relief. See \nChhoeun v. Marin, 306 F.Supp.3d 1147, 1162 (C.D. Cal. 2018) (“The Court has found that \nPetitioners [Cambodian nationals] are likely to succeed on their claim that removal without an \nopportunity to file and litigate motions to reopen constitutes a deprivation of Petitioners’ due \nprocess rights”); Devitri v. Cronen, 289 F.Supp.3d 287, 295 (D. Mass. 2018) (“Petitioners have \nproven a likelihood of success on their due process claim that they will suffer prejudice through a \ndenial of a meaningful opportunity to have a motion to reopen and motion to stay ruled on by the \nBIA and Court of Appeals prior to removal to a country [Indonesia] where they have a credible \nfear of persecution”); but see Hamama v. Adducci, 912 F.3d 869, 874 (9th Cir. 2018) (“The \nAttorney General’s enforcement of long-standing removal orders . . . is not subject to judicial \nreview”).  \n  \n-24- \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-06443-JMF   Document 1   Filed 07/11/19   Page 25 of 44\nCOUNT I \nViolation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment  \nto the United States Constitution \n91.

Legal service \nproviders, social service providers, and immigration advocates that work with children in \nremoval proceedings have received numerous reports throughout the country of significant \nnumbers of children who have either received defective notice of their removal proceedings and \nupcoming hearing dates, or who have not received notice at all. Yet immigration courts have \nissued and continue to issue numerous in absentia removal orders against such children, \nincluding those without legal representation. In absentia orders should not be issued on \nchildren’s cases when they have not received adequate notice of their immigration proceedings. \n \nWe suggest that you take following steps to remedy this problem. First, we appreciate the \nendeavors this Administration, Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) and the Executive Office \nfor Immigration Review (EOIR) have taken to provide counsel for children; we ask that this \nprogram be expanded to ensure no unaccompanied child will go before an immigration judge \nalone. Second, we ask that you immediately put procedures in place to ensure that children are \ngiven proper legal notice of their removal proceedings and hearing dates. Third, in light of the \nsignificant numbers of children who recently have received in absentia removal orders without \nnotice, we request that for every child who has received an in absentia removal order on or after \nMay 24, 2014, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) should move to reopen. EOIR should \ngrant that request, or alternatively, EOIR should reopen a child’s removal proceedings sua \n1 \n \nAILA Doc. No. 15030961. (Posted 3/9/15)\n\nCase 1:19-cv-06443-JMF   Document 1   Filed 07/11/19   Page 30 of 44\n \nsponte. EOIR should administratively close those children’s case they are unable to provide \nadequate legal notice of the new hearing. Going forward, EOIR should also grant continuances in \nchildren’s cases until such time as they can be sure proper legal notice is provided. Finally, EOIR \nshould allocate sufficient resources in order to update the EOIR hotline in a timely manner. \n \nAs you know, immigration courts have been directed to ensure that recently-arrived children \nhave their first master calendar hearing date within 21 days of the date that their notice to appear \n(“NTA”) is filed with the immigration court.1 Many immigration courts, including those with the \nhighest volumes of cases, have responded to this directive by establishing specialized dockets for \nhandling children’s cases. In the midst of the increase in children’s cases, ORR, EOIR and DHS \ninstituted a new procedure on May 1, 2014 meant to increase court efficiency and reduce the \nburden on sponsors to file change of address (“COA”) or change of venue (“COV”) forms. \nUnder the new procedure, DHS issues the NTA with the immigration court location and hearing \ndate marked “TBD” and delays filing the NTA until after the child is released to a sponsor or \nafter 60 days, whichever is earlier, or unless the child requests an earlier hearing. In such cases, \nORR, service providers and sponsors do not need to complete either the ORR Release \nNotification or the COV and COA forms. Instead, ORR emails a Discharge Notification form to \nvarious stakeholders. DHS procedure is to file the NTA with an immigration court based off the \naddress from the Discharge Notification. Since the procedure has gone into effect, service \nproviders have noticed a sharp increase in the breakdown in adequate notice to sponsors and \nchildren and on-going problems with NTAs being filed at the appropriate venue.  \nIn addition to this, the online version of the packet that ORR distributes to sponsors contains the \nwrong form for updating one’s address.2 Instead of the form titled Alien’s Change of \nAddress/Immigration Court, the packet includes a form used for address changes once an appeal \nis pending with the BIA. Unlike the correct form, this form does not contain any warnings about \nthe consequences of failing to update one’s address and it is pre-addressed to the BIA in Falls \nChurch, Virginia—not to the local immigration court.  Another issue resulting from the delay in \nfiling are cases in which a child and their sponsor move before their NTA is filed. Without \nknowing which court they will be required to appear in, a child cannot file their EOIR-33. This \ncan result in additional no-notice in absentia orders. \nCompounding this problem is the recent mandate to expedite the cases of recently-arrived \nchildren. Because EOIR is now required to have a child’s first master calendar hearing within 21 \ndays of the NTA’s filing, there is not enough time to identify these errors before the court issues \nthe invalid hearing notice. \n \nRegardless of the exact point where the flow of information is breaking down, these \ncommunication failures, combined with the mandate to expedite children’s cases, are clearly \nresulting in ubiquitous notice problems. We have received many reports of hearing notices \narriving with only a few days’ advance warning, and some reports of them arriving after a \nscheduled hearing date has passed. In some cases, the hearings were set to take place over a \n                                                           \n1 See David Rogers, Migrants’ right to counsel argued, Politico (Sept. 3, 2014) (quoting counsel for the government \nat oral argument in J.E.F.M. v. Holder as stating existence of 21-day policy). \n2 See ORR Div. of Children’s Services, Sponsor Handbook, PDF at 12-13. \nhttps://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/orr/sponsor_handbookrev_09_15_2014.pdf. \n2 \n \nAILA Doc.

For \nexample: \n \n●  Two sisters were initially detained in Los Angeles, where their NTAs were filed, but \nwere subsequently released to a sponsor in Alexandria, Virginia. The sisters did not \nreceive notice of their hearing date, so their lawyer called EOIR in mid-July 2014 and \nfound out that they had a hearing scheduled for early/mid-September 2014. This lawyer \nsubmitted a notice of appearance and a venue change request via U.S. mail to the Los \nAngeles Immigration Court, requesting a transfer to the Arlington Immigration Court. \nMuch to the sisters’ surprise, on July 28, 2014, they received a notice stating that their \nhearing dates had been set for that very afternoon in Los Angeles. The notices were dated \nJuly 23, 2014, and had been sent via regular mail to the sisters’ address in Virginia. The \nsisters’ lawyer managed to avert the entry of an in absentia order only by calling in a \npersonal favor with a local Los Angeles attorney, who covered the girls’ hearing and \nrequested a venue transfer.3 \n●  In the last quarter of Fiscal Year 2014, one regional post-release social service provider \nreported that out of her caseload of 13 cases, only in one case was the hearing notice \nprovided before the hearing.4 \n●  One child who was in ORR custody in Virginia was awaiting a home study on the \nsponsor in New Orleans prior to the child's release. The legal service provider checked \nthe EOIR hotline and discovered that the child's hearing was scheduled miles away in the \nNew Orleans immigration court for a hearing several days later, despite the child having \nnot been released from ORR custody.5  \n \nIn other cases, children are not receiving notice of their hearings at all. The reasons for these \nnotice failures appear to be complex, but much of this phenomenon also is likely explained by \nthe large numbers of children who have been required to appear in immigration court on an \nexpedited basis. For example, legal and social service providers have observed an increase in \ndatabase and human errors on the part of government actors, such as incorrect entry of addresses, \nand addresses on file with EOIR that do not match the addresses provided by the ORR sponsors. \nThese malfunctions not only result in initial notice failures, but also stymie those children and \ncustodians who make diligent efforts to obtain crucial information regarding their cases. The \nEOIR hotline, which sponsors rely on in order to obtain case status updates, often contains \nincorrect information or is not updated in a timely fashion. We have also heard reports of \nsponsors calling courts for assistance with filling out change-of-address forms, only to be turned \naway without instructions or told that they must wait to receive a notice of hearing before they \nare allowed to move. For example: \n \n●  In Los Angeles, an ORR sponsor received a hearing notice for the child living with her, \nas well as a notice for a child completely unknown to her. The ORR sponsor drove to the \nunknown child’s address and delivered the notice of hearing personally. The notice stated \nthat this child was required to appear in immigration court three days later. But for this \n                                                           \n3 Decl. of Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, J.E.F.M. v.

Holder, the Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint which added a new \nplaintiff named J.E.V.G. to the case.6 J.E.V.G. had never received notice of his first \nremoval hearing date. When he did not appear at the hearing, the immigration judge \nissued an in absentia removal order against him. After he was added as a plaintiff to the \nfederal lawsuit, the government conducted a review of J.E.V.G.’s file, which revealed \nthat EOIR had sent notice to an incorrect mailing address, likely resulting from an error \ntranscribing his address in the EOIR database. \n●  One teenage girl never received her notice in the mail. She was instructed by her post-\nrelease social service provider to call the hotline every day. The girl, however, was using \nthe Alien number of her son—not realizing that her number corresponded to a separate \ncase. Each time she called there was no hearing scheduled. The post-release service \nprovider then called on her behalf two weeks later and discovered that the girl and her \nson both had received removal orders in absentia.7  \n \nThese widespread notice problems are no doubt responsible, at least in part, for the large \nnumbers of children who have been ordered removed in absentia during the latter half of 2014. \nAccording to EOIR’s own data, from July 18, 2014 to October 1, 2014, immigration courts \nissued 1,449 in absentia orders against children who did not appear for their hearing dates.8 No \ndoubt that number has risen since October 1, 2014. Moreover, legal services providers have \nsubmitted sworn affidavits in J.E.F.M. v. Holder, 14-cv-01026-TSZ (W.D. Wash.), attesting to \nthe entry of at least dozens of in absentia removal orders against children, including in some \ncases where notice was plainly deficient.9  \n \nWhile the government has initiated new programs expand legal counsel for vulnerable groups, \nthe vast majority of unaccompanied children still do not have access to counsel. The \nrepresentation rate of children in immigration court has dropped precipitously, from 71% in 2012 \nto as low as 14-15% in some months of 2014.10 As data on case outcomes indicates, legal \nrepresentation vastly increases the chances that a child will appear in immigration court: Over \nthe last decade, only 6.1% of children with counsel received in absentia removal orders, \ncompared with 64.2% of unrepresented children.11 The intervention of counsel would no doubt \n                                                           \n6 Second Amended Compl., J.E.F.M. v.

For \nexample, on a single day in August, legal service organizations filed change of venue motions \nfor 200 children scheduled for hearings at the Chicago immigration court, but who no longer \nlived in the area.12 Without the work of those organizations, many if not all of those children \nwould now have removal orders. \n \nDespite mounting evidence of these pervasive and systemic notice deficiencies, Immigration \nJudges have ordered and continue to order the removal of children who fail to appear for their \nhearings. ORR sponsors frequently find out about the resulting in absentia order only when a \nlegal service provider or a post-release social service provider takes it upon herself to obtain the \nsponsor’s phone number and contact them. And, we presume, many such sponsors likely never \nfind out that the children in their care have been ordered removed in absentia.  \n \nIn absentia removal orders issued against children who have failed to receive proper notice \nviolate both the INA and the U.S. Constitution. See, e.g., Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 306 \n(1993) (“It is well established that the Fifth Amendment entitles aliens to due process of law in \n[removal] proceedings[.]”); see also Matter of G-Y-R, 23 I&N Dec. 181 (BIA 2001) (due process \nrequires that non-citizens receive notice of their removal hearings that is reasonably calculated to \nreach them). In keeping with these requirements, the INA and agency regulations require that all \nrespondents in removal proceedings receive proper notice of their hearings, and also create \nadditional protections specific to children. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(1)-(2); 8 C.F.R. § \n103.8(c)(2)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 236.2(a); see also G-Y-R, 23 I&N Dec. at 189-90 (recognizing that \nthat respondents may not be ordered removed in absentia until they are warned – by proper \nservice of the NTA – that consequence of failing to inform government of change in address is \nentry of removal order). If the child does not attend a removal hearing because she was not \nprovided proper notice of the hearing, she may have the resulting in absentia removal order \nrescinded. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii). \n \nGiven that a significant proportion of recently-arrived children who have been ordered removed \nin absentia have received defective or no notice of their hearing dates, thereby violating their \nstatutory and constitutional due process rights, the government must take steps to prevent these \nnotice problems in the future and undo the harm that has already been done. The circumstances \nof one of the named plaintiffs in J.E.F.M. v. Holder illustrates the effectiveness of the remedial \nmeasures that we propose. As noted above, one of the new Plaintiffs in that case, J.E.V.G., never \nreceived notice of his first removal hearing date and received an in absentia removal order. 13 \nAfter the government ascertained that EOIR had sent his hearing notice to the wrong address, it \nthen filed a motion to reopen J.E.V.G.’s in absentia order, acknowledging its error.14 Based on \nour experience serving these children and the reports of service providers throughout the country, \nwe suspect there are at least dozens, if not hundreds, of children who did not receive notice, just \nas J.E.V.G. did not. A review of their files would likely reveal that DHS should move to reopen, \nor alternatively, EOIR should reopen sua sponte the child’s case.  \n                                                           \n12 Odette Yousef, Lawyers Fear Speedy Deportations Harm Minors, WBEZ 91.5 (Aug. 27, 2014), \nhttp://www.wbez.org/news/lawyers-fear-speedy-deportations-harm-minors-110715. \n13 Second Amended Compl., J.E.F.M. v.

(Posted 3/9/15)\n\nCase 1:19-cv-06443-JMF   Document 1   Filed 07/11/19   Page 34 of 44\n \n \nIn conclusion, the increased volume of children’s cases in immigration courts, combined with the \ngovernment’s mandate to expedite the those cases, has resulted in numerous in absentia removal \norders that were issued in violation of the constitutional, statutory, and regulatory due process \nrights of children in removal proceedings. To remedy the violations that these children have \nsuffered, we recommend that the Government take the following steps: \n \n1.  Unaccompanied children in removal proceedings should be appointed counsel, no \nchild should be forced to navigate the complex immigration system alone.  \n \n2.  For every child who has received an in absentia removal order on or after May \n24, 2014, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) should move to reopen. EOIR \nshould grant that request, or alternatively, EOIR should reopen a child’s removal \nproceedings sua sponte, and EOIR should administratively close those children’s \ncase they are unable to provide adequate legal notice of the new hearing. Going \nforward, EOIR should also grant continuances in children’s cases until such time \nas they can be sure proper legal notice is provided. \n \n3.  Implement reliable procedures to ensure that children are provided fair and \naccurate notice of their hearings, while not unduly burdening the sponsor or child \nby having to file COVs or COAs.   \n \n4.  Ensure children are adequately advised of their right to request a hearing prior to \nthe 60 day filing delay; in particular this consequence needs to be explained to \nchildren who do not have family reunification resources and children in secure \nfacilities.  \n \n5.  Pending the implementation of reliable procedures and practices for providing \nnotice, EOIR should direct the immigration courts to grant continuances to non-\nappearing pro se children and continue to permit legal service providers to attempt \nto contact them, rather than entering in absentia removal orders against them. \nEOIR should also accept EOIR-33 forms at a central location as children and their \nsponsors do not have a court address prior to the filing. \n \n6.  Allocate sufficient resources to the EOIR hotline procedures to ensure it is \nupdated in a timely fashion and serves its purpose of facilitating notice. \n \n \nWe look forward to working with you in improving and implementing the above \nrecommendations. Thank you for your attention. \n \n \nSincerely, \n \nAmerican Friends Service Committee \nAmericans for Immigrant Justice \n6 \n \nAILA Doc. No. 15030961.
