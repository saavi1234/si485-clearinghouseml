    "summary": "<p>On September 20, 2019, two nonprofit organizations, alongside nine individuals (six of whom were also representing their minor children) filed this lawsuit against the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Director and Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the Attorney General of the United States. The suit challenged new federal expedited-removal immigration policies. The non-profits were Centro Presente--a state-wide Latin American immigrant membership organization dedicated to the self-determination and self-sufficiency of the Latin American population of Massachusetts; and Pioneer Valley Workers Center--an organization aimed at improving the lives of low-wage and immigrant workers in Western Massachusetts. The nine individual plaintiffs were all asylum-seekers who were threatened with expedited removal. The plaintiffs claimed that the new policy violated the due process and equal protection guarantees of the Fifth Amendment, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)(5 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;551), the Suspension Clause (Habeas Corpus), the Appointments Clause, and the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;1101). The plaintiffs sought to enjoin defendants from continuing this policy and also requested attorney&rsquo;s fees. The plaintiffs were represented by Lawyers for Civil Rights and a private law firm. The case was heard in the District Court for Washington D.C. and was presided over by Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson.</p>\r\n<p>The new expedited removal rule allowed any foreign citizen who had lived anywhere in the United States for less than two years to be submitted for expedited deportation proceedings. Previously, expedited deportation only applied to those located within 100 miles of a U.S. international land border and had only been in the United States for two weeks or less.</p>\r\n<p>On October 9, 2019, the court ordered the plaintiffs to show cause for why the case at hand should not be stayed until a separate case (Make the Road New York v. McAleenan) had been resolved. Make the Road New York was a class-action suit filed in the same court by the ACLU which also challenged the legality of the new expedited-removal rule. More information on that case is available <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=18176\">here</a>. The plaintiffs responded to the order to show cause on October 22, 2019; however this document was not available to the Clearinghouse.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed a motion to proceed pseudonymously which District Judge Jackson granted on July 8, 2020. The case then remained in the pleading stage for most of 2020 and 2021 as the government asked the court to reset the deadline for their answer on numerous occasions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Judge Jackson was elevated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit by President Biden in mid-2021 and the case was reassigned to Judge Jia M. Cobb.</p>\r\n<p>After multiple granted motions for extension of time, the government's answer is due by April 5, 2022. As of March 24, 2022, many of the documents included on the docket are inaccessible because the case is classified as a private immigration matter. It is unclear if the case will be settled under the Biden Administration, but for now the case remains open.</p>",

This case concerns the Trump Administration’s recent attempt to issue a new \nadministrative rule, without any public notice or comment, which dramatically and unlawfully \nexpands the reach of a process known as “expedited removal.” \n2.  Under the Administration’s newly attempted expansion of the expedited removal \nprocess, a low-level Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) immigration officer is given the \nauthority to summarily deport an individual who has been present in the United States for less than \ntwo years without any hearing, any meaningful opportunity to gather or present evidence, any \nsubstantive judicial review, or even any opportunity to consult with counsel or other trusted \nindividuals to understand their rights.  The decision to remove is based only on the officer’s own \nconclusions that the person has not been admitted or paroled, has not adequately shown the \nrequisite  continual  physical  presence  in  the  United  States  (without the  opportunity  for  the \nindividual to gather evidence on their behalf), and is inadmissible on one of two specified grounds. \n3.  Even if the person subject to expedited removal expresses a desire to apply for \nasylum or a fear of persecution if returned to their home country, that person is provided only a \ntruncated credible fear evaluation process—without the procedural safeguards that generally \nattend asylum claims, without the opportunity for meaningful assistance, and without the chance \nto appeal to a federal court should the immigration officer find no credible fear. \n4.  Traditionally, individuals within the United States who are ordered removed are \nprovided with notice, access to counsel, an opportunity to prepare their case, and a contested \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 3 of 73\nhearing before an immigration judge, with an opportunity to appeal any adverse decision to the \nBoard of Immigration Appeals and, if necessary, a federal court of appeals. \n5.  The expedited removal process was not introduced  into the Immigration and \nNationality Act (“INA”) until 1997, and since then it has been applied almost exclusively to \nindividuals who are either (i) arriving at ports of entry, or (ii) apprehended within 100 miles of a \nland border, and who have been physically present in the United States for less than two weeks. \n6.  Until now, with only limited exceptions,1 immigration authorities never sought to \napply expedited removal to individuals apprehended in the interior of the country, far from any \nland border, or individuals anywhere in the United States (including near a land border) who had \nbeen residing in the country for more than fourteen days. \n7.  This was with good reason: it is well established that all persons within the United \nStates, including noncitizens, are entitled to due process rights, which the expedited removal \nprocess unquestionably fails to provide.  Indeed, at least one prior administration decided against \nexpanding expedited removal beyond individuals at or near a land border and within a short time \nof entry, given concerns that it would deny those individuals the due process rights that the \nConstitution requires.2 \n8.  But on July 23, 2019, without providing  notice or an opportunity  for public \ncomment, the Trump Administration attempted to issue a new rule, styled as a “Notice,” that \ndramatically expands the reach of expedited removal to individuals (i) located anywhere in the \n                                                \n1 Undocumented immigrants who arrive by sea and who have been present in the United States for \nless than two years have been subject to expedited removal since 2002.  None of the Plaintiffs in \nthis case arrived by sea. \n2 See Alan Gomez, Trump’s Quick Deportation Plan May Be Illegal, Past Immigration Chiefs \nSay,  USA  Today  (Feb.  26,  2017  1:00  P.M.  ET), \nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/02/24/president-trumps-expedited-\nremoval-plan-may-be-illegal/98276078/. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 4 of 73\nUnited States, (ii) who cannot prove to an immigration officer’s satisfaction that they have been \ncontinuously present in the United States for more than two years, and (iii) who the immigration \nofficer  believes  is  inadmissible  based  on  lack  of  valid  entry  documents,  or  fraud  or \nmisrepresentation in connection with their entry.  See Notice Designating Aliens for Expedited \nRemoval, 84 Fed. Reg. 35409 (July 23, 2019) (“July 23 Notice” or the “Notice”). \n9.  The July 23 Notice was issued under the alleged authority of Defendant Acting \nSecretary of Homeland Security Kevin K. McAleenan, who has not been confirmed to the position \nof Secretary of Homeland Security with the advice and consent of the United States Senate.3 \n10.  The Notice purports to be effective immediately upon publication. \n11.  The Trump Administration’s unprecedented attempted expansion of expedited \nremoval follows years of public statements by President Trump and members of his Administration \nthat have made clear the Administration’s animus toward immigrants from Mexico, Central \nAmerica, and South America on the basis of their race, ethnicity, and national origin.  The July 23 \nNotice  was  designed  to  target  members  of  racial  and  ethnic  groups  disfavored  by  the \nAdministration. \n12.  The July 23 Notice also flies in the face of twenty years of evidence showing that \nthe expedited removal process, even at the border, is rife with errors and results in widespread \nviolations of individuals’ legal rights.  The government has erroneously deported numerous \nindividuals through expedited removal, including individuals with bona fide fears of persecution \n                                                \n3 Following the resignation of former Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen on April \n7,  2019,  President Trump  announced  his  intention  to  appoint  Kevin  McAleenan  as  Acting \nSecretary for the Department of Homeland Security.  The Secretary of Homeland Security reports \ndirectly to the President. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 5 of 73\nin their home countries.  Numerous reports, including a comprehensive study commissioned by \nCongress, have extensively documented the serious flaws in the expedited removal process. \n13.  The July 23 Notice will cause countless individuals who have been living and \nworking in the United States to be unlawfully and expeditiously torn from their lives, jobs, and \nfamilies, because they bear the burden of proof to show that they are not subject to expedited \nremoval and because the expedited removal procedure fails to provide them with time or a \nmeaningful opportunity to gather evidence, consult with counsel or even family or friends, or \nobtain any judicial review of an erroneous decision.  Nor do any other DHS regulations or statutory \nprovisions fill this crucial procedural gap. \n14.  Low-level DHS officers, operating without administrative or judicial oversight, can \nnow immediately subject potentially hundreds of thousands of individuals to expedited removal, \nwithout any consideration of their legitimate defenses to removal. \n15.  These officers likewise can, and will, order people removed through the expedited \nremoval process even though those individuals would have valid claims for asylum if they were \npermitted to proceed through the proper asylum process. \n16.  The July 23 Notice subjects the Individual Plaintiffs in this matter to all of the above \nrisks.  The Organizational Plaintiffs will be harmed because their members are subject to the \naforementioned risks and they will need to divert the time and resources of their staff that would \notherwise be dedicated to other efforts.   \n17.  As  further  detailed  below,  the  Plaintiffs  here  include  individuals  who  have \ncolorable claims for asylum, but who now face a likelihood of being deprived of a meaningful \nopportunity to vindicate those claims.  Others are teenagers who are statutorily entitled to full \nremoval proceedings, yet face a serious risk of being misidentified as adults or coerced into making \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 6 of 73\nfalse statements about their age.  Yet others, despite being present in the United States for less than \ntwo years, have established ties to their communities here, and are entitled by due process to an \nopportunity to develop all available defenses to removal in an adversarial hearing before a neutral \narbiter.  All of the individual Plaintiffs belong to racial or ethnic groups that are the target of racial \nand ethnic animus by the Trump Administration. \n18.  The Plaintiffs in this matter also include organizations whose members face similar \ndeprivations of their rights as a result of the July 23 Notice. \n19.  Individuals who have been living in this country for more than fourteen days are \nentitled to procedural due process under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution to \nprotect  their  liberty  interest  in  being  free  from  detention  or  removal  that  is  arbitrary, \ndiscriminatory, and/or unauthorized by law.  The July 23 Notice unconstitutionally deprives them \nof that process. \n20.  The  July  23  Notice  also  violates  the  Constitution’s  Equal  Protection  Clause.  \nContemporary statements by President Trump, Defendant McAleenan, Defendant Cuccinnelli, and \nother Administration officials demonstrate that the Notice was motivated by animus against \nimmigrants from Mexico, Central America, and South America on the basis of their race or \nethnicity. \n21.  The Administration also unlawfully bypassed the notice-and-comment and grace \nperiods required by the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) for regulatory changes of this \nnature, without good cause, thereby depriving the public of an opportunity to comment prior to \nthis radical change in the expedited removal regime.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 7 of 73\n22.  The expanded use of expedited removal also violates the APA because its gravely \ndeficient processes are not in accordance with law, are in excess of statutory authority or short of \nstatutory right, and fail to observe procedure required by law. \n23.  The July 23 Notice also violates INA and APA provisions requiring that individuals \nappearing before an immigration officer or immigration judge be permitted to be represented by \ncounsel. \n24.  There is no judicial review available, by habeas corpus or otherwise, of individual \nexpedited removal orders beyond three very limited factual questions.  As applied to individuals \ndescribed in the July 23 Notice, the statute therefore violates the Constitution’s Suspension Clause, \nas it effects an unauthorized suspension of the writ. \n25.  Finally, the July 23 Notice should be declared to have no force or effect because \nDefendant McAleenan was not properly appointed as Secretary of Homeland Security at the time \nthe Notice was published by him in the Federal Register, and for that reason he lacked authority \nto promulgate the Notice.  \n26.  The July 23 Notice is patently illegal.  Without relief from this Court, hundreds of \nthousands of individuals living anywhere in this country are at risk of being separated from their \nfamilies and expelled from the country without any meaningful process, in violation of the U.S. \nConstitution and federal law. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n27.  This case arises under the United States Constitution; the Administrative Procedure \nAct (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq. and the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1101 et seq. and its implementing regulations. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 8 of 73\n28.  The Court has jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3).  Section 1252(e)(3) is a \nprovision of the INA that provides jurisdiction in the United States District Court for the District \nof Columbia over “[c]hallenges [to the] validity of the system” of expedited removal, including \nregulations and written policies regarding expedited removal.  The Court also has jurisdiction \nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1331. \n29.  Venue is proper in this District because 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(A) requires that all \nSection 1252(e)(3) actions be brought in the United States District Court for the District of \nColumbia.  In addition, venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1) because a substantial part of \nthe events or omissions giving rise to this action occurred in this District and Defendants are \nofficers of the United States being sued in their official capacity and reside in the District. \nTHE PARTIES \nI.  ORGANIZATIONAL PLAINTIFFS \n30.  Plaintiffs  Centro  Presente  and  Pioneer  Valley  Workers  Center  (collectively, \n“Organizational  Plaintiffs”)  bring  this  complaint  on  behalf  of  their  organizations  and  the \nmembership of their organizations. \n31.  Established in 1981, Centro Presente is a state-wide Latin American immigrant \nmembership organization located at 12 Bennington Street, Suite 202/203, East Boston, MA 02128. \n32.  Centro Presente is dedicated to the self-determination and self-sufficiency of the \nLatin  American  immigrant  community  of  Massachusetts.    The  non-profit  organization  was \nfounded by Sister Rose Marie Cummings in direct response to the rapidly growing community of \nrefugees fleeing violence during the civil war conflicts in Central America in the 1980s.  Operated \nand led primarily by Central American immigrants, Centro Presente struggles for immigrant rights \nand for economic and social justice.  Through the integration of community organizing, leadership \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 9 of 73\ndevelopment, and basic services, Centro Presente strives to give members a voice and to build \ncommunity power.  \n33.  Centro Presente has a staff of seven and provides English as a Second Language \n(ESL) classes, legal services, immigration clinics, advocacy, and leadership development to over \nthree thousand families, youth, and children each year.  Through its programming, community \noutreach, and educational activities, Centro Presente serves hundreds of immigrants subject to the \nJuly 23 Notice—including their families and children.  \n34.  Today, Centro Presente has over 1,500 members.  Most members are from El \nSalvador and Honduras.  Centro Presente’s membership also includes U.S. citizens and non-\ncitizens.  Many of Centro Presente’s individual members have been in the United States for less \nthan two years and are subject to the July 23 Notice.  Other individual members have resided in \nthe United States for longer than two years but would be incapable of providing sufficient proof \nof such if erroneously placed in expedited removal proceedings.  All Individual Plaintiffs are \nmembers of Centro Presente. \n35.  Pioneer  Valley  Workers  Center  (PVWC)  is  a  membership  organization  with \nlocations at 20 Hampton Avenue, Suite 200, Northampton, MA 01060; and 1380 Main Street, 2nd \nFloor, Suite 203, Springfield, MA 01101. \n36.  PVWC has over 3,000 active members across the western part of Massachusetts. \n37.  PVWC  builds  the  collective  power  of  workers  and  immigrants  in  Western \nMassachusetts and beyond to win real change in the lives of working people. \n38.  PVWC’s 3,000 worker and immigrant members lead campaigns to improve wages \nand standards, and achieve long-term systemic change. Nearly all are frontline food industry \nworkers in restaurants and farms. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 10 of 73\n39.  PVWC  seeks  to  transform  systems  and  institutions  that  exploit  workers  and \nthreaten immigrants, locally to nationally.  Its member-run Worker Committees are democratic \ndecision-making bodies that build leadership through popular education and power analysis.  With \nlow-wage worker participants, the Committees lead strategic, creative campaigns to win real \nchange for workers and immigrants.  In both Springfield and Northampton, the Committees have \nwon legislative protections from immigration deportations and from wage theft, and fight for \nsimilar protections statewide and nationally. The Committees set PVWC’s organizing priorities \nand campaigns. \n40.  PVWC’s members will be put in extreme jeopardy by the July 23 Notice’s changes \nin the expedited removal program.  Members can now be removed without due process, and the \norganization is expending, and will continue to expend, additional resources to address this \nproblem. \nII.  INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFFS \n41.  The  individuals  listed  below  (collectively,  “Individual  Plaintiffs”)  bring  this \ncomplaint on behalf of themselves and on behalf of their minor children. \n42.  M. Doe currently resides in eastern Massachusetts, in a location more than 100 \nmiles from a U.S. international land border. \n43.  She fled El Salvador on or around April 25, 2019, with four minor children: her \nson, two of her nieces, and one nephew.  M. Doe intended to seek asylum for herself and all four \nchildren. \n44.  M. Doe and the four children arrived together in the United States on or around \nMay 4, 2019. \n45.  After crossing the southern border, they immediately presented themselves to \nimmigration officials.  \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 11 of 73\n46.  The border patrol agent asked if they spoke English. When it was determined that \nthey did not, they were placed in a small patrol vehicle, and then transferred to another vehicle.  \n47.  They were then dragged out of the patrol car, thrown on the ground, and handcuffed \nand placed into a second vehicle for transport to a detention facility. \n48.  They were taken to a detention facility where they were inspected, strip searched, \nand interrogated.  Officials onsite told them that even though they were traveling together as a \nfamily, that they would be separated in the detention facility. \n49.  M. Doe was allowed to stay in the same cell with her 9-year-old son, M.M. Doe, \nbut was separated from her nieces and nephew. \n50.  The cells were extremely cold, and both M. Doe and her son went hungry from lack \nof food. The cells were also overcrowded with dozens of other migrants in the small confined \nspace. \n51.  M. Doe and M.M. Doe were later transferred to a second detention facility which \nwas less crowded.  \n52.  There, M. Doe was presented with immigration documents that were in English \nonly.  No Spanish version was presented to her.  \n53.  M. Doe was asked if she wanted to sign a document for their voluntary departure. \nShe refused.   \n54.  When asked why they left El Salvador, M. Doe responded that she was seeking \nasylum.  M. Doe was referred to, and passed, a credible fear interview (“CFI”), but she was not \nprovided with documentation to show that she was found to have a credible fear of return.  \n55.  M. Doe and M.M. Doe remained in this second detention facility for approximately \nthree days, until they were placed on a bus to El Paso.  M. Doe and M.M. Doe were then released \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 12 of 73\nfrom detention.  M. Doe was not issued a Notice to Appear (“NTA”) in immigration court at the \ntime of her release. \n56.  From there, she came to eastern Massachusetts. She arrived in the Boston area on \nor about May 12, 2019.  \n57.  M. Doe is concerned that expedited removal will deprive her of an opportunity to \nappear in immigration court, and to apply for asylum or other immigration protection and relief.  \nShe is concerned that, without readily accessible documentation of her having passed her CFI, \nimmigration officers will not believe that she is entitled to apply for asylum.  She is also concerned \nthat she will again be pressured to sign forms in a language she does not understand.  \n58.  M.M. Doe is the 9-year-old minor son of M. Doe.  He resides with his mother in \neastern Massachusetts, in a location more than 100 miles from a U.S. international land border. \n59.  M.J. Doe is the minor niece of M. Doe.  She is 16 years old. She resides in eastern \nMassachusetts, in a location more than 100 miles from a U.S. international land border. \n60.  C. Doe is the minor niece of M. Doe. She is 15 years old. She resides in eastern \nMassachusetts, in a location more than 100 miles from a U.S. international land border. \n61.  At the initial immigration detention facility, M.J. Doe and C were both placed in a \ncell with other young girls.  They would remain in this cell for approximately nine days without \nthe ability to contact M. Doe. They were eventually relocated to a different detention center, where \nthey remained for 18 days until they were released.  \n62.  M.J. Doe and C. Doe are concerned that expedited removal will deprive them of an \nopportunity  to  appear  in  immigration  court,  and to  apply  for  asylum  or other  immigration \nprotection and relief.   \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 13 of 73\n63.  D. Doe is the minor nephew of M. Doe. He is 16 years old. He resides in eastern  \nMassachusetts, in a location more than 100 miles from a U.S. international land border. \n64.  In September 2018, D. Doe was on a school bus when it was intercepted by gang \nmembers.  The gang members demanded that one of D. Doe’s classmates join their gang, and when \nhe refused, the gang violently beat and murdered him.  D. Doe was told that if he didn’t join the \ngang, he would be next.  Several bystanders contacted law enforcement, but nobody was held \naccountable. \n65.  Afraid for his life, D. Doe fled abroad with his aunt, M. Doe.  \n66.  At the initial immigration detention facility, D. Doe was placed in a cell with other \nyoung boys.  He would remain confined in cells for approximately five days without the ability to \ncontact M. Doe. During this time, he was interrogated without an adult present, and explained that \nhe was afraid for his life and could not return to El Salvador.  \n67.  During his five-day stay, D. Doe was humiliated and assaulted.  \n68.  Immigration officers repeatedly insulted him, calling him “piojo”—the Spanish \nterm for “lice.”  \n69.  While D. Doe was walking, an immigration officer punched him in the back of the \nhead.  The impact knocked him to the ground.  Officers who were nearby responded with laughter. \nThey humiliated and laughed at D. Doe. \n70.  D. Doe was eventually relocated to a detention center where he remained for 48 \ndays.  At this center, he again explained that he was afraid to return to El Salvador.   \n71.  Although D. Doe repeatedly expressed a fear of return to his home country, he was \nnever referred for a CFI. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 14 of 73\n72.  D. Doe was released from detention on Father’s Day, June 17, 2019.  He was not \nissued a NTA. \n73.  D. Doe has been in extreme emotional distress since his release from detention.  He \nis afraid of being detained by immigration officials again on a daily basis, and is afraid to leave \nhis house except to go to school and come home.  When he does leave the house, he carries \npaperwork identifying his father as his sponsor with him at all times, in the hope that this might \noffer some protection if he is apprehended. \n74.  D. Doe is concerned that expedited removal will deprive him of an opportunity to \nappear in immigration court and to apply for asylum or other immigration protection and relief.  \nBased on his previous experience of not being referred for a CFI, he is concerned that immigration \nofficers once again will not even allow him the opportunity to establish his fear of return before \nan asylum officer.  He also worries that expedited removal will deprive him of an opportunity to \nfile a grievance to hold the immigration officer who physically assaulted him accountable.  \n75.  F. Roe lives in eastern Massachusetts, in a location more than 100 miles from a \nU.S. international land border.  She fled El Salvador and arrived in San Ysidro, California, on or \nabout January 16, 2019. \n76.  She fled to the United States with her four children (ages 10, 12, 13, and 15), \nbecause her children’s father was kidnapped by a gang and disappeared on October 16, 2013.   \n77.  F. Roe’s son and his father had been working in a field when they saw members of \na gang behead someone.  Members of the gang later tried to recruit her son, but his father pleaded \nwith them to leave his family alone and take him instead.  The gang members allowed her son to \ngo home, and his father disappeared. \n78.  F. Roe suspects that he was killed, but his remains have never been found.   \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 15 of 73\n79.  She repeatedly sought police protection and filed a report with law enforcement \nauthorities in El Salvador.  But the police failed to investigate or to take any action – instead, they \nmocked her as “crazy.”  The police also denied her request for protection.  \n80.  Gang members consistently threatened F. Roe after she filed the police reports.  On \nseveral occasions, they even tried to lure her to various locations to kill and silence her, but other \ncommunity members warned her each time. \n81.  F. Roe wanted to leave El Salvador as soon as possible, but she had to wait for five \nyears after their father disappeared to leave the country because if she had left within 5 years, she \nwould have been legally determined to have kidnapped her children away from their father. \n82.  Since she exhausted all local and domestic options to find her husband – and keep \nherself and her children safe – she fled.  F. Roe traveled with her youngest daughter, age 10, and \nher three older children followed shortly after them. \n83.  After  crossing  the  border,  F.  Roe  and  her  youngest  daughter  surrendered  to \nimmigration officials.  She was transported to a detention facility where she stayed with her 10-\nyear-old daughter for one night. The following day, she was transferred to another center where \nshe remained for approximately two days. \n84.  F. Roe immediately requested asylum because she fears returning to El Salvador.  \nF. Roe was referred for a CFI, after which she was fitted with an ankle monitor and released from \ndetention with her daughter.  They arrived in the Boston area on or about January 21, 2019.  Her \nother three children were initially detained in Texas but subsequently released, and they then joined \nher in eastern Massachusetts. \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 16 of 73\n85.  F. Roe’s children are now all in school in Massachusetts and are developing ties to \ntheir local community.  The family is trying to live a quiet life and not bring attention to \nthemselves. \n86.  F. Roe is concerned that expedited removal will deprive her and her children of an \nopportunity to appear in immigration court and to apply for asylum or other immigration protection \nand relief.   \n87.  C. Loe resides in eastern Massachusetts, in a location more than 100 miles from a \nU.S. international land border. She arrived in Rio Grande City, Texas on or about May 11, 2019, \nwith her 2-year-old son, J. Loe. \n88.  Her husband, Plaintiff J.P. Loe, arrived in Hidalgo, Texas on or about April 18, \n2019, with their 8 year-old daughter, S. Loe. \n89.  C. Loe owned a small shop where she sold food and fruit in El Salvador.  The family \nlived in a violent, gang-controlled neighborhood. \n90.  One evening, while walking home after dark, C. Loe was attacked and raped by \nmultiple gang members. The gang members took turns raping her while they covered her mouth. \nThey threatened to kill her if she reported the crime.  \n91.  On or about September 2018, C. Loe was coerced by gang members – under threat \nof violence – to pay $300 in September, $300 in October, $300 in November, and $600 in \nDecember.  \n92.  The extortion increase was difficult for her to pay. But she borrowed money to \nmake the payment, and continued paying. In March 2019, C. Loe was unable to pay the extortion, \nand she asked for additional time.  \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 17 of 73\n93.  The gang members responded aggressively and violently.  In lieu of payment, the \ngang members threatened to rape her 8-year-old daughter, just like they raped her. \n94.  Terrified,  and  in  fear  and  under  threat  of  rape,  the  family  started  making \narrangements to leave. \n95.  To protect their daughter, J.P. Loe fled first with S. Loe.  They arrived in Hidalgo, \nTexas on or about April 18, 2019.  They entered without detection and eventually arrived in eastern \nMassachusetts. \n96.  C. Loe followed with J. Loe, and they arrived in Rio Grande City, Texas on or about \nMay 11, 2019.  They immediately surrendered themselves to immigration officials.  \n97.  They were placed on a vehicle and transported to an immigration detention facility \nthat was over capacity. \n98.  That night, since the facility was over-crowded, C. Loe and her two-year-old son \nslept on the ground outside – literally, on dirt and rocks.  \n99.  They were brought into the facility the following day. \n100.  C. Loe was asked why she left El Salvador, and she explained that they were fleeing \nrape, extortion, and violence.  C. Loe stated that she was seeking asylum, but was not referred for \na CFI.  She and her son were later released from detention.  The family is concerned that expedited \nremoval will deprive them of an opportunity to appear in immigration court and to apply for asylum \nor other immigration protection and relief.  Based on C. Loe’s previous experience of not being \nreferred for a CFI, she is concerned that immigration officers once again will not even allow her \nthe opportunity to establish her fear of return before an asylum officer.   \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 18 of 73\n101.  I.  Moe  is  a  Guatemalan  immigrant  who  has  been  in  the  United  States  for \napproximately five months.  She currently resides in eastern Massachusetts, in a location more \nthan 100 miles from a U.S. international land border, where she is involved in a local church. \n102.  I. Moe has two children.  Her daughter M. Moe is 1 year old.  Her son J. Moe is 8 \nyears old.  \n103.  I. Moe fled to the United States after drug traffickers in Guatemala murdered her \nhusband. \n104.  Drug traffickers arrived in their remote village in Guatemala and told the villagers \nto leave. But I. Moe’s husband refused. While holding their one-year-old daughter in his arms, her \nhusband said their home had been in the family for generations, and that they would not leave their \ncrops. \n105.  The drug traffickers shot her husband while he held the baby in his arms. \n106.  The drug traffickers threatened to kill her and the children. \n107.  I. Moe fled the village with her children but continued to receive threats. \n108.  I. Moe sought police protection, but law enforcement refused to help.  \n109.  In fear for her safety, I. Moe fled with her children to the United States, eventually \ncrossing the border without detection.   \n110.  I. Moe is concerned that expedited removal will deprive her of an opportunity to \nappear in immigration court and to apply for asylum or other immigration protection and relief.   \n111.  M. Poe is a Honduran immigrant who has been in the United States for two months.  \nShe currently resides in eastern Massachusetts, in a location more than 100 miles form a U.S. \ninternational land border, where she is involved with a local church. \n112.  M. Poe has one daughter, J. Poe, who is 5 years old.  \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 19 of 73\n113.  M. Poe and J. Poe were detained at the U.S. border.  They were later released from \nimmigration custody, at which time M. Poe was given a NTA.  However, the court listed was in \nTexas when M. Poe specifically informed immigration agents that she was going to the eastern \nMassachusetts area.  While in immigration custody, M. Poe did not express an intent to seek \nasylum or fear of return to Honduras. \n114.  M. Poe is concerned that expedited removal will deprive her and her daughter of an \nopportunity to appear in immigration court and to apply for asylum or other immigration protection \nand relief.  \n115.  R. Koe is a Honduran immigrant who has been in the United States for two months.  \n116.  R. Koe is currently residing in eastern Massachusetts, in a location more than 100 \nmiles from a U.S. international land border, where he is involved with a local church \n117.  R. Koe has a son, D. Koe, who is 11 years old.  \n118.  R. Koe fled with his son to the United States after being kidnapped and tortured by \nthe National Police of Honduras.   \n119.  R. Koe was pulled over by the Honduran police while driving his motorcycle.  The \npolice said that they were looking for someone, who wasn’t R. Koe, and he showed the police his \nidentification to prove it.  But instead of letting him go, the police put a bag over his head, forced \nhim into the police car, and beat him with hard objects and burned him.  Later that day, with no \nexplanation, they let him go. \n120.  Living in fear, R. Koe stopped leaving his home alone.  As soon as he was able to \nsecure money to leave, he fled with his son. \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 20 of 73\n121.  R. Koe and D. Koe were detained at the U.S. border.  R. Koe told immigration \nagents that he was seeking asylum, but he was not referred for a CFI; the only questions he was \nasked were about who helped him get to the border. \n122.  R. Koe and D. Koe were released from immigration custody a few days later.  R. \nKoe was given a NTA, but it did not include any information like a court date – it only provided a \nphone number to call.  When he called the phone number, he was told that his case is not yet in \nthe system. \n123.  D. Koe is now doing well in his school in Massachusetts. \n124.  R. Koe is concerned that expedited removal will deprive him of an opportunity to \nappear in immigration court and apply for asylum because he is not safe in Honduras.  Based on \nhis previous experience of not being referred for a CFI, he is concerned that immigration officers \nonce again will not even allow him the opportunity to establish his fear of return before an asylum \nofficer.  He is also concerned that because his case is reportedly not in the immigration court \n“system” yet, he will not be allowed to pursue relief there. \nIII.  DEFENDANTS \n125.  Defendant Kevin McAleenan is sued in his allegedly official capacity as the Acting \nSecretary of DHS.  In this capacity, he directs each of the component agencies within DHS, \nincluding United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”), United States Citizenship \nand Immigration Services (“USCIS”), and United States Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”).  \nThe Secretary of Homeland Security is responsible for the administration of the immigration laws \npursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1103.  Specifically, as relevant here, the Secretary is empowered to \ndesignate  categories  of  noncitizens  subject  to  expedited  removal.    See  8  U.S.C.  §  \n1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I). \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 21 of 73\n126.  Defendant Matthew T. Albence is sued in his allegedly official capacity as Acting \nDirector of ICE, which is the agency responsible for the enforcement of the immigration laws, \nincluding the apprehension and detention of noncitizens, in the interior of the United States. \n127.  Defendant Mark Morgan is sued in his allegedly official capacity as the Acting \nCommissioner  of  CBP,  the  agency  responsible  for  the  initial  processing  and  detention  of \nnoncitizens  who  are  apprehended  at  or  near  the  border  and  placed  in  expedited  removal \nproceedings. \n128.  Defendant Kenneth T. Cuccinelli is sued in his allegedly official capacity as the \nActing Director of USCIS, which  is the agency that, through its asylum officers, conducts \ninterviews of certain individuals placed in the expedited removal process to determine whether \nthey have a credible fear of persecution and therefore are entitled to have a hearing before an \nimmigration judge in which they can apply for relief and protection from removal. \n129.  Defendant William Barr is sued in his official capacity as the Attorney General of \nthe United States. In this capacity, he is responsible for the administration of the immigration laws \npursuant  to  8  U.S.C.  §  1103,  oversees  the  Executive  Office  for  Immigration  Review  (the \nadministrative immigration court system), and is empowered to grant asylum or other relief. \nFACTS \nI.  THE EXPEDITED REMOVAL PROCESS \n130.  Before  the  enactment  of  the  Illegal  Immigration  Reform  and  Immigrant \nResponsibility Act (“IIRIRA”) in 1996, noncitizens were granted full immigration court hearings \nbefore they could be removed, even if they had entered the country without inspection or were \nseeking entry at a border.  These individuals were also entitled to administrative appellate review \nof any order for their removal before the Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) and judicial \nreview in federal court. \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 22 of 73\n131.  Under IIRIRA, most immigrants retained the procedural right to an adversarial \nhearing before an Immigration Judge (“IJ”), commonly referred to as a “Section 240” proceeding.  \nDuring this proceeding, immigrants have the right to counsel, are provided an opportunity to put \non affirmative evidence and challenge the allegations and evidence against them, and may apply \nfor asylum or any other relief from removal.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(4) (right to counsel, \npresenting evidence, challenge allegations); 8 U.S.C. § 1158 (asylum).  Immigrants in a Section \n240 hearing are also entitled to an administrative appeal to the BIA if the IJ orders them removed, \nwhich triggers an automatic stay of deportation while the appeal is pending.  See 8 U.S.C. \n1535(c)(1).  Immigrants may also seek judicial review of a BIA decision against them in the \napplicable federal court of appeals.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1252. \n132.  At the same time, however, in stark opposition to the immigration court procedures \nin Section 240 proceedings, IIRIRA introduced expedited removal.  See generally 8 U.S.C. § \n1225(b)(1).  Expedited removal is a highly truncated removal process that eliminates almost all \nprocedural protections for certain classes of immigrants. \n133.  The expedited removal process begins—and often ends—with an inspection by an \nimmigration  officer.    Instead of  having  the  opportunity  to  present their  case  before  an  IJ, \nindividuals placed into expedited removal can be ordered removed by an immigration officer \n“without further hearing or review.”  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i).  \n134.  The  immigration  officer  can  summarily  order  an  immigrant  removed  upon \nunilaterally making all of the following three findings: \na.  The individual is either in the process of arriving in the United States or is \namong a particular class of immigrants designated by the Secretary of \nDHS4; \n                                                \n4 As to the latter, this subsection requires the immigration officer to determine whether the \nindividual “is described in clause (iii),” referring to 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii).  As explained \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 23 of 73\nb.  The  individual  is  inadmissible  because  they  engaged  in  fraud  or \nmisrepresentation to procure admission or other immigration benefits, 8 \nU.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C), or lacked the requisite documents for admission at \nall, id. § 1182(a)(7); and   \nc.  The individual does not indicate either an intention to apply for asylum or a \nfear of persecution if returned to their home country. \n8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i). \n135.  Immigrants may only obtain further review by expressing the intent to apply for \nasylum or communicating a fear of persecution if returned to their home country.  See 8 U.S.C. § \n1225(b)(1)(A)(ii).  If a person subject to the expedited removal process does express a desire to \napply for asylum or fear of persecution, then the immigration officer “shall refer the alien for an \ninterview by an asylum officer.”  Id. \n136.  This referral to a CFI is the first point in the expedited removal process when the \nindividual is permitted to “consult with a person or person of the[ir] . . . choosing,” including \ncounsel.  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iv); see Am. Immigration Lawyers Ass’n v. Reno, 18 F. Supp. \n2d 38, 55-56 (D.D.C. 1998), aff’d, 199 F.3d 1352 (D.C. Cir. 2000).  \n137.  To prevail at the CFI, the individual must show “a significant possibility, taking \ninto account the credibility of the statements made by the alien in support of the alien’s claim and \nsuch other facts as are known to the officer, that the alien could establish eligibility for asylum.”  \n8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v). \n138.  If the asylum officer determines that the individual meets the credible fear standard, \nthen the individual will be “detained for further consideration of the application for asylum” in \n                                                \nfurther below, infra ¶ 144, “clause (iii)” provides the Secretary of DHS with authority to designate \ncertain classes of people as subject to expedited removal. \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 24 of 73\naccordance with full Section 240 removal proceedings.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B); 8 C.F.R. § \n208.30(f). \n139.  However, if the asylum officer determines in the CFI that the individual does not \nmeet the applicable standard, then “the officer shall order the alien removed from the United States \nwithout further hearing or review.”  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii). \n140.  There is only a very limited right to review of a negative CFI determination in \nexpedited removal proceedings.  The individual may request review of the determination by an IJ, \nbut that review is truncated: the review may be “either in person or by telephonic or video \nconnection,” and “shall be concluded . . . to the maximum extent practicable within 24 hours, but \nin  no  case  later  than  7  days  after”  the  initial  negative  CFI  finding.    8  U.S.C.  § \n1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(III).  IJs are not even required to provide any reasons for their decisions: they \ncan simply check a box on a form indicating that the CFI determination is “affirmed.”  See \nThuraissigiam v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Security, 917 F.3d 1097, 1118 (9th Cir. 2019). \n141.  This process falls far short of the process afforded to individuals seeking asylum \nthrough regular Section 240 immigration proceedings, including a live hearing before an IJ where \nthey can present and cross-examine evidence, preserve objections, and appeal any adverse decision \nto the BIA and federal appellate courts.  See 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(f). \n142.  During the inspection and credible fear stages of expedited removal, DHS generally \ndetains the individual.  See 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(2)(iii), (b)(4)(ii).   \n143.  At any time during the expedited removal process, the immigration officer may \npermit the immigrant to withdraw their application for admission and allow them to depart \n“immediately” without issuing an expedited removal order.  8 U.S.C § 1225(a)(4).  However, this \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 25 of 73\noption is entirely in the “discretion” of DHS, id.; officers are not required to advise individuals of \nthis option.5 \n144.  Although Congress initially authorized expedited removal only for individuals who \nwere applying for admission at a port of entry, see 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i), IIRIRA allowed \nthe Secretary of DHS6 to apply expedited removal to other individuals who had already entered \nthe country without being officially admitted.  See id. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I). \n145.  However,  IIRIRA  provided  that,  before  the  Secretary  could  apply  expedited \nremoval to individuals other than those presenting at a border, the Secretary would have to \naffirmatively designate which classes of people would be included in the expedited removal \nprocess.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I). \n146.  Under Section 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I)-(II), the Secretary may designate as subject to \nexpedited removal any or all noncitizens in the country who have not been admitted or paroled \ninto the United States and who are unable to “affirmatively show[], to the satisfaction of an \n                                                \n5 This is significant because an expedited removal order carries draconian consequences beyond \nremoval itself.  Individuals who are issued expedited removal orders are subject to a five-year bar \non admission to the United States unless they qualify for a discretionary waiver. See 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1182(a)(9)(A)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 212.2.  Individuals issued expedited removal orders after having \nbeen found inadmissible based on misrepresentation are subject to a lifetime bar on admission \nunless they are granted a discretionary exception or waiver.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C). \n6 IIRIRA originally delegated this authority to the  Attorney General.  However,  under  the \nHomeland Security Act of 2002, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”), under the \ndirection of the Attorney General, ceased to exist, and its functions were transferred to DHS, \neffective March 1, 2003.  See Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, 116 Stat. \n2135 (Nov. 25, 2002).  As a result, statutory references to the INS or its officers are deemed to \nhave been replaced by reference to DHS or the applicable DHS official.  See 6 U.S.C. § 557; see \nalso  8  U.S.C.  §  1103(c)  (assigning  to  the  former  Commissioner  of  the  INS  “any  and  all \nresponsibilities and authority in the administration of the [INS] and of this chapter which are \nconferred upon the Attorney General as may be delegated to him by the Attorney General or which \nmay be prescribed by the Attorney General”). \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 26 of 73\nimmigration officer,” that they have been continuously physically present in the United States for \ntwo years.  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II); see 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(6). \n147.  As with individuals who present at a border, Congress specified that individuals \nidentified in a “designation” by the Secretary could be subject to expedited removal only if they \nwere inadmissible for having committed certain forms of immigration fraud or lacking the required \ndocuments.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i), (A)(iii)(I). \n148.  Until 2002, the government did not exercise this “designation” power.  From 1997 \nto 2002, expedited removal was only applied to immigrants who arrived at a port of entry.  See \nInspection and Expedited Removal of Aliens; Detention and Removal of Aliens; Conduct of \nRemoval Proceedings; Asylum Procedures; Final Rule, 62 Fed. Reg. 10312 (Mar. 6, 1997). \n149.  In 2002, the government began expanding its use of expedited removal.  Expedited \nremoval started being used to remove individuals within the country who had arrived by sea \nwithout admission and who, at the time of their inspection by an immigration officer, had been \ncontinuously present in the country for less than two years.  See Notice Designating Aliens Subject \nto Expedited Removal Under Section 235(b)(1)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 67 \nFed. Reg. 68924 (Nov. 13, 2002). \n150.  In 2004, expedited removal was authorized for immigrants who (i) had entered the \ncountry other than by sea, (ii) could not prove that they had been continuously physically present \nin the country for more than 14 days, and (iii) were apprehended within 100 miles of a land border.  \nSee Designating Aliens for Expedited Removal, 69 Fed. Reg. 48877, 48879 (Aug. 11, 2004). \n151.  This 2004 designation remained in effect until DHS attempted to issue the July 23 \nNotice.   \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 27 of 73\n152.  Thus, between 1997 and 2019, with the limited exception of certain individuals \nwho arrived by sea, immigration authorities never sought to apply expedited removal to individuals \napprehended far from a land border, or individuals anywhere in the United States (including near \na land border) who had been residing in the country for more than fourteen days. \nII.  WIDESPREAD AND WELL-KNOWN DEFICIENCIES ALREADY EXIST IN \nTHE EXPEDITED REMOVAL PROCESS, WHICH THE JULY 23 NOTICE \nWILL EXACERBATE. \n153.  The expedited removal process already suffers from numerous serious deficiencies \nthat are well documented and known to the Defendants, and which result in widespread violations \nof constitutional and statutory rights.  \n154.  Defendants  are  well  aware  of  these  flaws.    Nevertheless,  Defendants  have \nattempted to expand a systematically deficient process to an extremely broad new category of \nindividuals, without any safeguards to address these problems. \n155.  Indeed, the Individual Plaintiffs and others like them may face even greater risks \nfrom these deficient procedures than those who were previously subject to expedited removal (i.e., \nthose presenting at a port of entry or who were detained close in time and location to their land \nborder crossing), as explained further below. \nA.  Lack of Judicial Review \n156.  In the expedited removal process, an individual’s removability is determined by a \nlow-level immigration enforcement officer who acts as both prosecutor and judge, rather than by \na  neutral  adjudicator,  as  required  in  Section  240  removal  proceedings.  See  8  U.S.C.  § \n1225(b)(1)(A)(i). \n157.  A removal order “entered in accordance with” the expedited removal process—\neither under Section 1225(b)(1)(A)(i) for a person who did not claim a fear of persecution, or under \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 28 of 73\nSection 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(I) for a person who received a negative CFI determination—“is not \nsubject to administrative appeal.”  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(C). \n158.  There are only two exceptions to this bar on administrative appeals: the limited CFI \nreview explained above, and certain procedures applicable if the person “claims under oath, or as \npermitted under penalty of perjury . . . to have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence, to \nhave been admitted as a refugee . . . , or to have been granted asylum.”  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(C); \nsee 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(5).   \n159.  Federal court habeas corpus review of an order of expedited removal is “limited to \ndeterminations of—(A) whether the petitioner is an alien, (B) whether the petitioner was ordered \nremoved under [the expedited removal section], and (C) whether the petitioner can prove by a \npreponderance of the evidence that the petitioner is an alien lawfully admitted for permanent \nresidence, has been admitted as a refugee . . . , or has been granted asylum.”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(2).  \nOtherwise, federal courts are stripped of jurisdiction to conduct any habeas review of an expedited \nremoval order.  8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(A). \n160.  Individuals subject to expedited removal have only an extremely narrow avenue to \ndirectly challenge the constitutionality or lawfulness of any aspect of the expedited removal \nprocess. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3), titled “Challenges on validity of the system,” provides: “Judicial \nreview of determinations under section 1225(b) of this title and its implementation is available in \nan action instituted in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, but shall be \nlimited to determinations of—(i) whether such section, or any regulation issued to implement such \nsection, is constitutional; or (ii) whether such a regulation, or a written policy directive, written \npolicy guideline, or written procedure issued by or under the authority of the Attorney General to \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 29 of 73\nimplement such section, is not consistent with applicable provisions of this subchapter or is \notherwise in violation of law.” \n161.  Any challenge under Section 1252(e)(3) must be filed “no later than 60 days after \nthe  date  the  challenged  section,  regulation,  directive,  guideline,  or  procedure  .  .  .  is  first \nimplemented.”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(B). \n162.  Other than in a properly filed action under Section 1252(e)(3), a court is not \npermitted to “enter declaratory, injunctive, or other equitable relief in any action pertaining to” an \nindividual order of expedited removal (except as it relates to the three extremely limited factual \npredicates for which habeas review is available).  8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(1).  This means that, if \nsomeone is detained for expedited removal or actually removed via that process any time after the \n60-day period following the promulgation of a new rule, they have no avenue to challenge their \nremoval order itself or the “validity of the system” that produced it. \n163.  Further, the INA provides that “no court shall have jurisdiction to review” any of \nthe following, including in habeas: \na.  “any individual determination or to entertain any other cause or claim \narising from or relating to the implementation or operation of an order of \n[expedited] removal”;  \nb.  “a decision by the Attorney General to invoke the provisions” of expedited \nremoval; \nc.  “the application of [expedited removal] to individual aliens”; or \nd.  “procedures and policies adopted by the Attorney General to implement the \nprovisions of” the expedited removal section.   \n8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(A). \n164.  Finally, the INA provides that “no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or \nclaim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by the Attorney General to \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 30 of 73\ncommence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against any alien under this \nchapter.”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(g). \n165.  The effect of this combination of provisions is that, once an immigration officer \nmakes the initial determination that a person is inadmissible for a qualifying reason and is subject \nto expedited removal, that person loses all their right to judicial review of the process that put them \nthere, except in two very limited situations (truncated review of a negative CFI determination, or \na sworn claim to be a lawfully admitted permanent resident, refugee, asylee, or U.S. citizen).  See \n8 U.S.C. §§ 1225(b)(1)(A)(i), 1225(b)(1)(C), 1252(a)(2)(A).  The expedited removal process fails \nto provide an opportunity for individuals to raise claims that their detention by ICE or removal \nviolated a statutory or constitutional requirement. \n166.  Moreover, DHS regulations do not provide for a right of access to counsel in \nexpedited removal except during the specific time period between an initial claim of asylum and a \nCFI, so a person detained pursuant to the expedited removal process would not have an opportunity \nto consult with counsel to learn about their rights before the immigration officer makes the \ndetermination of inadmissibility.  A person who does not claim asylum will get no opportunity to \nconsult with counsel at all.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iv); Am. Immigration Lawyers Ass’n, 18 \nF. Supp. 2d at 55-56. \n167.  Even for those who assert a fear of persecution, there is no requirement that they \nbe afforded a reasonable opportunity to secure counsel.  This is especially significant for asylum \nseekers because, as a study commissions by Congress found, asylum seekers without access to \ncounsel have a much lower chance of being granted asylum (2 percent) than those who have an \nattorney (25 percent).  U.S. Comm’n on Int’l Religious Freedom, Report on Asylum Seekers in \nExpedited  Removal:  Volume  I:  Findings  &  Recommendations  4  (2005),  available  at \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 31 of 73\nhttps://www.uscirf.gov/sites/default/files/resources/stories/pdf/asylum_seekers/Volume_I.pdf \n(“2005 USCIRF Study”).7 \nB.  Deficient Procedures for Establishing That an Individual Is Subject to \nExpedited Removal \n168.  The expedited removal process deprives individuals of a meaningful opportunity to \nshow that they are not subject to expedited removal, or to removal at all. The Defendants are well \naware of the widespread inadequacies in these processes, and yet have now chosen to expand the \nexpedited removal system rather than addressing any of the problems that lead to erroneous results \nand deprivation of rights. \n169.  Although immigrants are generally detained during the inspection and expedited \nremoval process, see 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(2)(iii), (b)(4)(ii), they are not even afforded the ability \nto make a telephone call to someone who could help, let alone access to counsel.  See Am. \nImmigration Lawyers Ass’n, 18 F. Supp. 2d at 53-56.   \n170.  DHS  regulations  do  not  mandate  interpretive  services  for  people  whose  first \nlanguage is not English, but rather state that an interpreter should be used “if necessary to \ncommunicate” with the individual.  8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(2)(i).  Immigration officers often do not \nuse professional interpreters to communicate with non-English-speaking individuals, but rather \nuse other officers, who sometimes step into the role of a second interviewer instead of merely \ninterpreting.   See U.S. Comm’n on Int’l Religious Freedom, Barriers to Protection: The Treatment \nof  Asylum  Seekers  in  Expedited  Removal  27  (2016),  available  at \nhttps://www.uscirf.gov/sites/default/files/Barriers%20To%20Protection.pdf  (“2016  USCIRF \nStudy”).  In other cases, officers do their own translation from Spanish, even where they may not \n                                                \n7 See also id. at 3 (describing congressional mandate). \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 32 of 73\nunderstand an individual’s local dialect.  Id.  A purported shortage of telephonic interpreters for \nCentral American indigenous languages means that officers sometimes recruit other detainees to \ninterpret.  Id. at 27-28.  If no interpreter is easily available, an officer might not offer interpretive \nservices at all.  Id. at 28. \n171.  The inspecting officer is not required to make any independent effort to corroborate \nor verify any information about the individual, unless the individual makes a claim to U.S. \ncitizenship; to lawful permanent resident, refugee, or asylee status; or to having been previously \nadmitted or paroled.  8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(5)(i), (b)(6).  \n172.  If an individual claims to have citizenship or lawful status, the immigration officer \nmust check “all available Service data systems and any other means available to the officer” for \nconfirmation of the individual’s claim.  8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(5)(i).  Neither the statute nor the \nimplementing regulations provide for an opportunity for the individual to gather evidence in \nsupport of their claim of citizenship or lawful status.   \n173.  If the individual’s claim of lawful status cannot be verified at this first step, the \nofficer “shall” issue an expedited removal order, and then refer that order to an immigration judge \nfor review.  Id.  If the IJ determines that the individual does not have citizenship or permanent \nresident, refugee, or asylee status, then the removal order will be affirmed, and there is no appeal \nfrom the IJ’s decision.  Id. § 235.3(b)(5)(iv).  If the IJ determines that the individual does have \nlawful status, the expedited removal order is vacated—but the agency may still refer the individual \nfor full removal proceedings (except in the case of U.S. citizens, who cannot be removed).  Id. § \n235.3(b)(5)(iv). \n174.  Even if an individual’s claim to lawful permanent resident, refugee, or asylee status \nis verified at the “database check” stage, the immigration officer has discretion to deny the \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 33 of 73\nindividual an opportunity to apply for the proper documents (or waiver of documentation, as \napplicable), and to place the individual into full removal proceedings.  Id. § 235.3(b)(5)(ii)-(iii). \n175.  When an individual placed into expedited removal claims to have received prior \nadmission or parole, DHS regulations state that the individual should “be given a reasonable \nopportunity to establish to the satisfaction of the examining immigration officer that he or she was \nadmitted or paroled into the United States following inspection at a port-of-entry,” including via \n“documentation in the possession of the alien, the Service, or a third party.”  8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(6).  \nThe immigration officer is also instructed to “attempt to verify the [individual’s] status through a \ncheck of all available Service data systems.”  Id.  However, no procedures or applicable time \nperiods are provided for the individual’s putative opportunity to gather evidence, and ultimately \n“[t]he burden rests with the [individual] to satisfy the examining immigration officer of the claim \nof lawful admission or parole.”  Id. \n176.  An individual who seeks to contest the other critical factual predicates for expedited \nremoval—inadmissibility and continuous physical presence—has no meaningful opportunity to \ndo so.  Rather than the government bearing the burden to show that an individual meets these \nstandards to qualify for expedited removal, the individual bears the burden of proving that they are \nnot subject to expedited removal.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II) (individual must show \ncontinuous presence to “satisfaction of” immigration officer); 8 C.F.R §§ 253.3(b)(1)(ii) (burden \non individual to show continuous presence).  Yet the individual is not provided with any time to \nprepare;  any  means  by  which  to  gather  evidence;  any  right  to  counsel  recognized  by  the \ngovernment; or any ability to make their arguments before a neutral decisionmaker—all in sharp \ncontrast to Section 240 proceedings, where individuals are entitled to such safeguards. \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 34 of 73\n177.  In addition, the expedited removal process fails to require that the immigration \nofficer assess individuals to ensure that they are mentally competent or otherwise have the capacity \nto participate in the inspection process.  See, e.g., Lyttle v. United States, 867 F. Supp. 2d 1256, \n1269-73 (M.D. Ga. 2012) (describing expedited removal of U.S. citizen with mental disabilities \nafter immigration officers coerced him to sign documents he did not understand and ignored \nobvious evidence of his disabilities).  Unsurprisingly, then, there are also no additional safeguards \nshould an individual be found to have competency or capacity issues.   \n178.  Immigration officers are also not required to consider an immigrant’s serious \nmedical conditions.  Indeed, the Trump Administration recently, without notice, ended deferred \ndeportation for immigrants with serious medical conditions (previously administered through \nUSCIS), and a spokesperson for ICE stated that “ICE does not exercise discretion on a categorical \nbasis  to  exempt  entire  groups  from  immigration  laws.”    See  Shannon  Dooling,  Trump \nAdministration Ends Protection for Migrants’ Medical Care, NPR (Aug. 27, 2019, 7:39 AM), \nhttps://www.npr.org/2019/08/27/754634022/trump-administration-ends-protection-for-migrants-\nmedical-care; Shannon Dooling, ICE Confirms the End of Medical Deferrals; Mass. Delegation \nUrges  Trump  to  Reconsider,  WBUR  (Aug.  30,  2019,  6:17  PM), \nhttps://www.wbur.org/news/2019/08/30/medical-deferred-action-ice-response-warren-markey-\npressley.  A person thus may be summarily removed even if they are present in the United States \nto receive life-saving medical care.  \n179.  Immigration officers also are not required to consider an immigrant’s substantial \nconnections to the United States when applying expedited removal; rather, it is left to an individual \nofficer’s discretion. \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 35 of 73\n180.  Although  immigration  officers  are  required  to  take  sworn  statements  from \nindividuals that relate to the factual predicates for expedited removal, the statements recorded are \n“often inaccurate and nearly always unverifiable.”  2005 USCIRF Study at 74; see also id. at 53 \n(in seven out of 12 observed cases in which immigration officers refused to make a CFI referral \nafter an individual expressed fear of persecution, the officers falsely recorded on the sworn \nstatement that the individual did not express any fear); id. at 55 (“paper files created by the \ninspector are not always reliable indicators of” what actually happened in the interview); 2016 \nUSCIRF Study at 20 (documenting instance of officer falsely recording that individual had no \nquestions when she did ask a question).     \n181.  Asylum officers have reported that the forms filled out by immigration officers \ncommonly contain egregious errors.  See, e.g., 2016 USCIRF Study at 21 (asylum officers reported \nit was “common” for forms to contain errors regarding individuals’ reports of fear of persecution); \nBorderland Immigration Council, Discretion to Deny: Family Separation, Prolonged Detention, \nand Deterrence of Asylum Seekers at the Hands of Immigration Authorities Along the U.S.-Mexico \nBorder  13  (2017)  (“Borderland  Report”),  available  at \nhttps://media.wix.com/ugd/e07ba9_72743e60ea6d4c3aa796becc71c3b0fe.pdf  (describing \nevidence “that CBP affidavits are often inconsistent with asylum-seekers’ own accounts”). \n182.  Asylum officers have also reported seeing “many forms with identical answers, and \nothers with clearly erroneous ones”—such as forms indicating that a male individual was asked \nand answered whether he was pregnant.  2016 USCIRF Study at 21. \n183.  Studies have likewise observed immigration officers failing to give interviewees an \nopportunity to review and respond to the statements in the expedited removal forms.  See, e.g., \n2016 USCIRF Study at 20; American Civil Liberties Union, American Exile: Rapid Deportations \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 36 of 73\nthat  Bypass  the  Courtroom  43  (2014)  (“American  Exile”),  available  at \nhttps://www.aclu.org/files/assets/120214-expeditedremoval_0.pdf  (in  72%  of  observed  cases, \nindividuals signed sworn statement without being given an opportunity to review).  As a result, \nindividuals routinely are deprived of any opportunity to correct errors in their statements. \n184.  Immigration officers also routinely employ coercive tactics to force non-English-\nspeaking individuals to sign expedited removal forms in English, without any translation.  For \nexample, when one Spanish-speaking individual refused to sign expedited removal forms written \nin English and asked to speak to a judge, the immigration officer told him: “Here, I’m the judge, \nthe attorney, and the one who is going to deport you.”  American Exile at 35-36; see also, e.g., id. \nat 34 (“Most of the individuals interviewed . . . stated that they were given forms to sign in English, \nwhich most did not speak or read, and often were not interviewed by an immigration officer who \nfluently spoke their language or through an interpreter.”); id. at 34-36 (describing examples of \nindividuals who were required to sign forms in languages they do not understand); Borderland \nReport at 13 (“[I]ndividuals are forced to sign legal documents in English without translation.”); \n2016 USCIRF Study at 28 (describing the case of a detained Ethiopian asylum seeker who was \ndenied an interpreter). \n185.  CBP has declined to implement video recordings of expedited removal interviews \nor to use undercover “testers” to ensure that immigration officers are complying with the law—\nboth suggestions made as far back as 2005.  See 2016 USCIRF Study at 23. \n186.  Immigration officers have also used expedited removal against unaccompanied \nminors, particularly teenagers, even though the INA requires these minors to be placed in full \nSection 240 removal proceedings (with one exception, not relevant here, applicable to children \nwho are citizens of contiguous countries).  See 8 U.S.C. § 1232(a)(5)(D).  Immigration officers \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 37 of 73\nhave in some cases assumed a minor’s age based on their appearance, and in other cases have \npressured or coerced minors to falsely state that they are adults or that they do not fear persecution \nin their home countries.  See American Exile at 71-72. \n187.  The  lack  of  any  meaningful  administrative  review  also  contributes  to  errors.  \nAlthough DHS regulations require a supervisor to review the issuance of an expedited removal \norder, see 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(7), that requirement is limited to review of the paperwork and does \nnot provide any independent review of the facts.  A mere “review of the sworn statement and any \nanswers and statements made by the alien regarding a fear of removal or return,” id., is not \nmeaningful when these records are, as described above, frequently  inaccurate or downright \nfalsified.  And as noted, administrative appeals are barred.  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(C). \n188.  The  widespread  and  chronic  persistence  of  key  factual  errors  in  DHS’s \ndeterminations of eligibility for expedited removal are the natural consequence of a system bereft \nof necessary procedural protections. \nC.  Deficient Procedures for Asylum Seekers \n189.  Although  individuals  who  express  a  desire  to  apply  for  asylum  or  fear  of \npersecution in their home countries may receive greater review of their cases than those who do \nnot,  the  procedures  for  asylum  seekers  in  expedited  removal  are  still  woefully  deficient, \nparticularly given the stakes—individuals face serious harm or even death if they are wrongfully \ndeported. \n190.  A  2005  study  commissioned  by  Congress  documented  numerous  “serious \nproblems” in the expedited removal process, “which put some asylum seekers at risk of improper \nreturn.”  2005 USCIRF Study at 10. \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 38 of 73\n191.  A  2016  follow-up  study  “revealed  continuing  and  new  concerns,”  including \n“certain CBP officers’ outright skepticism, if not hostility, toward asylum claims; and inadequate \nquality assurance procedures.”  2016 USCIRF Study at 2. \n192.  The 2005 USCIRF study found that in 15% of observed cases, when an individual \nexpressed a fear of persecution to an immigration officer, the officer failed to refer the individual \nto an asylum officer for a CFI, as required by statute.  2005 USCIRF Study at 53-54.  . \n193.  Numerous other reports have made the same observations. See, e.g., Borderland \nReport at 12 (“In 12% of the cases documented for this report, individuals expressing fear of \nviolence upon return to their country of origin were not processed for credible fear screenings and \ninstead, were placed into removal proceedings.”); American Exile at 4, 32-33 (interviewees \nindicated  that “they told the agent they were afraid of returning to their country but were \nnevertheless not referred to an asylum officer before being summarily deported”); Human Rights \nWatch,  You  Don’t  Have  Rights  Here  8  (2014)  (“Human  Rights  Watch”),  available  at \nhttps://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/us1014_web_0.pdf (“[S]ome said that US border \nofficials ignored their expressions of fear and removed them with no opportunity to have their \nclaims examined; others said border officials acknowledged hearing their expressions of fear but \npressured them to abandon their claims.”); cf. Hearing before the H. Judiciary Subcomm. on \nImmigration & Border Sec. at 5 (Feb. 11, 2015) (statement of Eleanor Acer, Dir., Refugee \nProtection,  Human  Rights  First),  available  at \nhttp://www.humanrightsfirst.org/sites/default/files/Statement-of-Eleanor-Acer-Feb-11.pdf  (“In \nsome cases, interviews are sometimes rushed, essential information is not identified due to lack of \nfollow up questions, and/or other mistakes are made that block genuine asylum seekers from even \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 39 of 73\napplying for asylum and having a real chance to submit evidence and have their case fully \nconsidered.”). \n194.  Immigration officers have also used intimidation and coercion to pressure asylum \nseekers not to express a fear of persecution in their home countries.  Studies have documented \nofficers falsely telling asylum seekers that they have no right to seek asylum or that they do not \nhave a valid basis for asylum (see, e.g., American Exile at 36-37; Borderland Report at 13-14; \n2016 USCIRF Study at 22); telling asylum seekers that they will be jailed and eventually deported \nanyway if they try to pursue an asylum claim (see American Exile at 36; Borderland Report at 14); \nand outright ignoring claims of fear (see American Exile at 38; Human Rights Watch at 26-27).  \nFor instance, in one documented example, CBP officers told an asylum seeker that persecution on \nthe basis of sexual orientation cannot be grounds for asylum—a clear falsehood.  Borderland \nReport at 13.   \n195.  Individuals  placed  into  expedited  removal  are  often  “subjected to  hours-long \n‘interviews’ during CBP screening, which more closely resemble interrogations, with intending \nasylum seekers being badgered by authorities until they provide the answers DHS officials seek—\nthat an individual has come to the United States to work or reunite with family, not seeking safety.”  \nBorderland Report at 13. \n196.  Even where asylum applicants are referred for a CFI, there are serious flaws in the \nprocedures, particularly given the complexity of asylum law and the fact that asylum applicants \nare likely to be traumatized. \n197.  Although DHS regulations recognize that there is a right before and during the CFI \nto consult with a third party, 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(d)(4), these regulations do not recognize a right to \nrepresentation by counsel (or even a right to be given time and opportunity to locate counsel).  Nor \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 40 of 73\ndo the regulations recognize a right to counsel prior to or during any IJ review of a negative \ncredible fear determination, despite the fact that the INA generally provides that “[i]n any removal \nproceedings before an immigration judge,” the individual “shall have the privilege of being \nrepresented.”  8 U.S.C. § 1362.   As a result, few individuals in the credible fear process have \naccess to counsel.   \n198.  Even the few who do have counsel often cannot be effectively represented due to \nrestrictions on attorney contact with clients.  See Human Rights Watch at 32 (citing finding that \n“ICE fails to provide or facilitate access to counsel when questioning represented individuals, \nrestricts  attorney-client  communications  in  detention  facilities,  and  has  also  discouraged \nnoncitizens from seeking legal counsel”). \n199.  For the vast majority of individuals who are forced to proceed pro se, there is no \nobligation for the asylum officer or IJ to fully develop the record or advise the individual about \nwhat they must prove to prevail. \n200.  The asylum officer is not required to create a transcript or audio recording of the \nCFI.  Instead, the asylum officer need only record a written summary of the “material facts,” 8 \nC.F.R. § 208.30(d)(6), see also 8 USC § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(II), and a written record of “the \nofficer’s analysis of why, in light of [the] facts, the alien has not established a credible fear of \npersecution.”  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(II). \n201.  Although the credible fear standard allows the asylum officer to consider “such \nother facts as are known to the officer,” 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v), the expedited removal \nprocedures do not require the asylum officer give the individual  an opportunity to respond to any \nfacts provided to the officer by the government. \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 41 of 73\n202.  In some cases, women and their children have been interviewed together for the \nmother’s CFI, which has caused the mothers to hold back key details of their persecution in order \nto protect their children.  See Human Rights Watch at 34; Letter from Am. Immigration Lawyers \nAss’n, et al. to Leon Rodriguez, Dir., U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Servs., and Sarah Saldana, \nDir.,  U.S.  Immigration  &  Customs  Enforcement,  at  2  (Dec.  24,  2015),  available  at \nhttps://www.aila.org/advo-media/aila-correspondence/2015/letter-uscis-ice-due-process. \n203.  There are also systemic inadequacies in interpretation services during the CFI \nprocess, as there are in the initial interview with the immigration officer.  See, e.g., Report of the \nDHS  Advisory  Committee  on  Family  Residential  Centers  96-99  (2016),  available  at \nhttps://www.ice.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report/2016/ACFRC-sc-16093.pdf (discussing \nineffective or nonexistent interpretation services for Spanish and indigenous language speakers \nduring CFIs and IJ reviews of  negative credible  fear determinations);  Acer Statement at 6 \n(describing case of an indigenous language speaker being deported under expedited removal after \nher CFI was conducted in Spanish). \n204.  Further, although an IJ reviewing a negative credible fear finding “may receive into \nevidence any oral or written statement which is material and relevant to any issue in the review,” \n8 C.F.R. § 1003.42(c), at no point is the individual provided an adequate opportunity to gather \nevidence.  The fact that the individual is most likely in detention during this process likewise \nimpedes the ability to marshal evidence in one’s defense.  See Human Rights Watch at 31 (quoting \nSecond Circuit judge Robert A. Katzmann’s observation that “[t]he two most important variables \naffecting the ability to secure a successful outcome in a[n immigration] case . . . are having \nrepresentation and being free from detention”).  In regular Section 240 proceedings, the individual \nwould have time and opportunity to gather evidence, including potential expert testimony. \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 42 of 73\nD.  Examples of Illegal Expedited Removals \n205.  One result of the widespread flaws in the expedited removal process is that many \nindividuals have been erroneously removed from the United States—including U.S. citizens.  See, \ne.g., Lyttle, 867 F. Supp. 2d 1256; Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, de la Paz v. Johnson, No. \n1:14-CV-016 (S.D. Tex. Jan. 24, 2014) (U.S. citizen erroneously subjected to expedited removal \nbecause CBP officer did not believe that a U.S. citizen would speak only Spanish); Ian James, \nWrongly Deported, American Citizen Sues INS for $8 Million, L.A. Times (Sept. 3, 2000), \nhttps://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2000-sep-03-mn-14714-story.html  (recounting \nexpedited removal of mentally handicapped U.S. citizen after agents refused to believe her \npassport was valid). \n206.  DHS also has erroneously removed an unknown, but apparently significant, number \nof asylum seekers pursuant to expedited removal orders.  As detailed above, immigration officers \nroutinely ignore or actively discourage claims of fear of persecution.  See supra ¶¶ 192-93.  The \nresult, predictably, has been serious physical harm to people who were entirely correct to fear \nreturning to their home countries.  See, e.g., American Exile at 37-39 (describing incidents of rape, \nkidnapping, extortion, shooting, and domestic abuse following expedited removal of individuals \nwho feared persecution).  DHS has even deported people who have already been granted asylum \nin the United States.  See American Exile at 37 (asylee deported under expedited removal was \nsubsequently raped and kidnapped in her home country). \n207.  DHS has also been known to issue expedited removal orders that exceed the scope \nof its authority.  For example, in 2014, a Mexican citizen who had been living in the United States \ncontinuously for 14 years was removed pursuant to an expedited removal order even though, at \nthe time of his detention, expedited removal could not legally be applied to individuals who had \nbeen in the country for more than 14 days.  See American Exile at 63; see also, e.g., Borderland \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 43 of 73\nReport at 17 (individual married to a U.S. citizen and with a U.S. citizen child denied stay of \nremoval and summarily deported without notice to his family or attorney, despite having lived in \nthe United States for two decades).  \nIII.  THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION REPEATEDLY EXPRESSES \nDISCRIMINATORY INTENT AND RACIAL ANIMUS TOWARD MEXICAN, \nCENTRAL AMERICAN, AND SOUTH AMERICAN IMMIGRANTS \n208.  President Trump has repeatedly and consistently stated that his goal is to deport \nmillions of immigrants,8 and he has denigrated immigrants from the inception of his presidential \ncampaign.9   \n209.  Historically,  expedited  removal  has  been  used  almost  exclusively  to  deport \nindividuals from Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. In fiscal year 2013, individuals \nfrom these countries made up 98 percent of the people deported through expedited removal. \nImmigrants from the same four countries represented 97 percent of the removals in 2012, 96 \npercent in 2011, and 94 percent in 2010.10 \n                                                \n8  See, e.g., Amy B. Wang, Donald Trump Plans to Immediately Deport 2 million to 3 million \nUndocumented  Immigrants,  Wash.

Moreover, individuals from these four countries are historically referred for CFIs \nat very low rates: 0.1% of all migrants from Mexico, 1.9% from Honduras, 0.8% from Guatemala, \nand 5.5% from El Salvador.  See Human Rights Watch at 22 (citing data from 2010 through 2012).  \nBy comparison, migrants from other countries were referred for CFIs at an average rate of 21% \n(although wide variations do exist between countries).  Id. at 21, 23.  Indeed, during the period \nstudied in the Human Rights Watch report, Mexican migrants were referred for CFIs at the second-\nlowest rate of any country—following only Canada.  Id. at 23.  Guatemalans were referred at the \nfourth-lowest rate, id., despite the well-documented existence of systemic human right abuses in \nGuatemala.11   \n211.  The  July  23  Notice  is  part  of  the  Trump  Administration’s  agenda  to  target \nimmigrants from Mexico and Central and South America on the basis of race and ethnicity.  \n212.  From 2015 until the present, President Trump and his Administration have made it \nclear that their goal is to deter non-white immigrants from entering the United States by targeting \nnon-white immigrants within the United States for unequal treatment, including through removal \nproceedings.  The administrations’ discriminatory comments and policies include: \na.  Then-candidate  Trump  beginning  his  presidential  bid  claiming  that \nMexican  and  South  American  immigrants  crossing  the  border  were \ncriminals and rapists.

In May 2018, President Trump, through then–Homeland Security Secretary \nKirstjen Nielsen, enacted a so-called “zero-tolerance policy” that led to \nincreased  family  separations  for  immigrants. The new practice was to \nfederally prosecute any immigrant caught crossing the southern border \nillegally, including those with valid asylum claims.  Then–Attorney General \nJeff Sessions explained, “if you cross the border unlawfully… we’re going \nto prosecute you” and any immigrant bringing a child will have that child \nseparated  from  them.

In September 2018, the Trump Administration decreased the refugee cap \nfrom 45,000 refugees to 30,000.

Before becoming Acting USCIS Director, Defendant Cuccinelli likewise \ncompared immigration to an “invasion” and suggested that states could use \n“war powers” to turn immigrants back: “[B]ecause [the states are] acting \nunder war powers, there’s no due process. They can literally just line their \nNational Guard up — presumably with riot gear like they would if they had \na civil disturbance — and turn people back at the border. Literally, you don’t \nhave to keep them, no catch-and-release, no nothing.

The Trump Administration’s attempted expansion of expedited removal under the \nJuly 23 Notice is intended to target the class of non-white immigrants already present in the United \nStates for unequal treatment through removal without sufficient protections or process. \n214.  Courts have previously found that similar comments and policies made by the \nAdministration are indicative of unlawful racial animus.

THE JULY 23 NOTICE DRASTICALLY EXPANDS EXPEDITED REMOVAL  \n215.  The expansion of expedited removal under the July 23 Notice will result in more \nerroneous removals and violations of immigrants’ rights.  Any individual may be apprehended by \nimmigration authorities in any location and summarily removed without a meaningful process to \ntest whether that individual is properly subject to detention, to expedited removal, or even to \nremoval at all. \nA.  Background and Promulgation of the July 23 Notice \n216.  On January 25, 2017, within days of his inauguration, President Trump signaled his \nintention to fulfill his campaign promise to deport more immigrants by requesting a significant \nexpansion of the expedited removal procedure.  He signed an Executive Order titled “Border \nSecurity and Immigration Enforcement Improvements,” which states in relevant part that “[i]t is \nthe policy of the executive branch to . . . expedite determinations of apprehended individuals’ \nclaims of eligibility to remain  in the United States.” See Border Security and Immigration \nEnforcement Improvements, 82 FR 8793 §§ 1, 2(c). \n217.  Section 11(c) of the Executive Order directs the Secretary of DHS to take action to \napply expedited removal to certain individuals arrested anywhere within the United States who \nhave been continuously present for less than two years.  Id. § 11(c).  \n218.  In response, then–Secretary John Kelly issued a memorandum on February 20, \n2017, stating: “To ensure the prompt removal of aliens apprehended soon after crossing the border \nillegally, the Department will publish in the Federal Register a new Notice Designating Aliens \nSubject to Expedited Removal Under Section 235(b)(l)(a)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality \nAct, which may, to the extent I determine is appropriate, depart from the limitations set forth in \nthe  designation  currently  in  force.”    John  Kelly,  Dep’t  of  Homeland  Sec.,  Memorandum \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 50 of 73\nImplementing  the  President’s  Border  Security  and  Immigration  Enforcement  Improvements \nPolicies 5-7 (2017). \n219.  While no official action took place until July 2019, the President continued to \npublicly fume about immigrants from Mexico, Central America, and South America.  For instance, \non June 24, 2018, President Trump tweeted: “We cannot allow all of these people to invade our \nCountry. When somebody comes in, we must immediately, with no judges or court cases, bring \nthem back where they came from.” Donald Trump (@realdonaldtrump), Twitter (June 24, 2018, \n8:02 AM), www.twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1010900865602019329.   \n220.  Similarly, on June 19, 2018, President Trump tweeted: “Democrats are the problem.  \nThey don’t care about crime and want illegal immigrants, no matter how bad they may be, to pour \ninto and infest our Country, like MS-13. . . .”  Donald Trump (@realdonaldtrump), Twitter (June \n19,  2018,  6:42  AM),  www.twitter.com/realdonaldtrump \n/status/1009071403918864385.    President  Trump  has  also tweeted  that  “When  we  have  an \n‘infestation’ of MS-13 GANGS in certain parts of our country, who do we send to get them out? \nICE!  .  .  .”    Donald  Trump  (@realdonaldtrump),  Twitter  (July  3,  2018,  3:49  AM), \nwww.twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1014098721460686849. \n221.  On October 29, 2018, President Trump tweeted: “Many Gang Members and some \nvery bad people are mixed into the Caravan heading to our Southern Border.  Please go back, you \nwill not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process.  This is an \ninvasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!”  Donald Trump (@realdonaldtrump), \nTwitter  (October  29,  2018,  7:41  AM),  www.twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/ \nstatus/10569190649064906469376.  A few weeks later, he tweeted: “[T]he U.S. is ill-prepared for \nthis invasion, and will not stand for it.  They are causing crime and big problems in Mexico.  Go \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 51 of 73\nhome!”    Donald  Trump  (@realdonaldtrump),  Twitter  (November  18  2018,  10:42  AM), \nwww.twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1064227483187318784. \n222.  On November 1, 2018, President Trump stated the he believes asylum seekers are \ngenerally lying about their fears of persecution: “An alien simply crosses the border illegally, finds \na Border Patrol agent, and using well-coached language – by lawyers and others that stand there \ntrying to get fees or whatever they can get – they’re given a phrase to read. They never heard of \nthe phrase before. They don’t believe in the phrase. But they’re given a little legal statement to \nread, and they read it. And now, all of a sudden, they’re supposed to qualify.”  Remarks by \nPresident Trump on the Illegal Immigration Crisis and Border Security, White House (Nov. 1, \n2018),  https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-illegal-\nimmigration-crisis-border-security/. \n223.  On April 5, 2019, President Trump stated during a visit to the border that asylum is \na “scam” and a “hoax”; that the country’s “system is full” and cannot take any more “asylum \npeople”; and that when “I look at some of these asylum people, they’re gang members . . . They’re \nnot afraid of anything.  They have lawyers greeting them. They read what lawyers tell them to \nread.”  Trump Says Some Asylum Seekers Are Gang Members, CBS News (Apr. 5, 2019),   \nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-says-some-asylum-seekers-are-gang-members-border-\ncalexico-2019-04-05-today/. \n224.  President Trump reiterated this view the next day, describing migrants from Central \nAmerica as “[s]ome of the roughest people you have ever seen” and mocking their claims of fear \nof persecution: “Asylum – oh give him asylum!  He’s afraid, he’s afraid . . . We don’t love the fact \nthat he’s carrying the flag of Honduras or Guatemala or El Salvador only to say he’s petrified to \nbe in his country.”  Michelle Mark, Trump Mocks Asylum-Seekers at the Border, Says They ‘Look \n51 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 52 of 73\nLike  They  Should  Be  Fighting  for  the  UFC,’  Business  Insider  (Apr.  6,  2019), \nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/trump-mocks-asylum-seekers-calls-system-scam-2019-4. \n225.  Defendant Cuccinelli has likewise echoed these sentiments, stating in June 2019 \nthat “[p]lenty of [asylum seekers] are lying and saying they want asylum and trying to make up \ncases  for  asylum.”    Sunday  Morning  Features  Transcript,  Fox  News  (June  30,  2019), \nhttps://www.foxnews.com/transcript/rep-tim-ryan-calls-trumps-historic-visit-to-the-dmz-an-\nappeasesent-tour. \n226.  On July 23, 2019, with no notice and comment period or warning of any kind, \nActing DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan published the July 23 Notice in the Federal Register, \npurporting to authorize the expansion of expedited removal by “designating” anyone anywhere in \nthe country who cannot prove “to the satisfaction of an immigration officer” that they have been \nin the United States continuously for longer than two years.  See July 23 Notice, 84 Fed. Reg. at \n35409. \n227.  Specifically,  the  July  23  Notice  provides  that  the  following  categories  of \nimmigrants are now subject to expedited removal: “(1) Aliens who did not arrive by sea, who are \nencountered anywhere in the United States more than 100 air miles from a U.S. international land \nborder, and who have been continuously present in the United States for less than two years; and \n(2) aliens who did not arrive by sea, who are encountered within 100 air miles from a U.S. \ninternational land border, and who have been continuously present in the United States for at least \n14 days but less than two years.”  July 23 Notice, 84 Fed. Reg. at 35409. \n228.  The new policy purports to be effective immediately upon publication.  July 23 \nNotice, 84 Fed. Reg. at 35410. \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 53 of 73\n229.  There are no special circumstances that would justify DHS’s failure to provide \nadvance notice of its decision, or to allow for and respond to public comment prior to the effective \ndate of the expansion.  The July 23 Notice cites only a generalized “concern[] that delayed \nimplementation could lead to a surge in migration across the southern border during a notice- and-\ncomment period.”  84 Fed. Reg. at 35413.  However, the Notice cites no evidence that increasing \nthe use of expedited removal could prevent a hypothetical “surge” in migration.  Even more \nsignificantly, the government’s prior expedited removal policy already allowed the government to \nuse expedited removal for any immigrant who presents at a port of entry or who is apprehended \nwithin 100 miles of the southern border and within 14 days of entry—categories that are plainly \nmore than sufficient to deal with any supposed “surge” of immigrants.  \n230.  The Notice provides no logical rationale for why it was necessary and why it needed \nto subvert notice and comment, and did not provide an explanation for how it would accomplish \nits supposed purpose.  However, the President and his Administration have consistently stated that \ntheir goal is to deport undocumented immigrants without judges or due process.12  The decision to \nexpand expedited removal was made in furtherance of that goal. \nB.  Effects of the July 23 Notice \n231.  The July 23 Notice  instantly and unlawfully put Plaintiffs  in this action and \nthousands of other similarly situated immigrants at imminent risk of deportation without a hearing \n                                                \n12 See, e.g., Amy B. Wang, Donald Trump Plans to Immediately Deport 2 million to 3 million \nUndocumented  Immigrants,  Wash.  Post  (Nov.  14,  2016), \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/13/donald-trump-plans-to-\nimmediately-deport-2-to-3-million-undocumented-immigrants/;  Franco  Ordoñez,  Trump \nThreatens to Deport ‘Millions,’ As He Kicks Off Campaign For Reelection, NPR (June 18, 2019), \nhttps://www.npr.org/2019/06/18/733661860/trump-threatens-to-deport-millions-as-he-kicks-off-\ncampaign-for-reelection; Donald Trump (@realdonaldtrump), Twitter (June 24, 2018, 8:02 AM), \nwww.twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1010900865602019329. \n53 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 54 of 73\nbefore an IJ, without the ability to appeal, and without even the most basic opportunity to collect \nand present evidence on their own behalf.   \n232.  For individuals who have been residing in the country for an extended period or \nwho are apprehended far from a land border, the risk of error in the expedited removal process is \nparticularly high. \n233.  For  example,  by  putting  the  burden  on  the  individual  to  show two  years  of \ncontinuous presence, the July 23 Notice (in combination with existing statutory and regulatory \npolicies) effectively imposes a default presumption that, in the absence of affirmative evidence \npresented by the detained person, any individual detained by ICE anywhere in the country is a \nnoncitizen who has not been continuously present for two years or more. \n234.  That presumption makes no sense when applied to individuals apprehended in the \ninterior of the United States.  On information and belief, only a very small minority of the \nundocumented immigrants residing in this country arrived less than two years ago without having \nbeen admitted or paroled.  That means that the vast majority of the undocumented immigrants that \nDHS might apprehend cannot properly be placed in expedited removal proceedings.  Yet all of \nthese people now face the risk of being erroneously placed into expedited removal under the July \n23 Notice if they cannot show, without any notice or opportunity to prepare—likely after being \nunexpectedly detained in the course of going about their everyday lives—that they have been in \nthe United States continuously for more than two years. \n235.  The July 23 Notice thus poses an imminent and substantial risk of wrongful removal \nto individuals who have been present in the country for greater than two years—or who may be \nU.S. citizens or lawfully admitted permanent residents, refugees, or asylees—but who are unable \n54 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 55 of 73\nto prove their length of residence or legal status to the satisfaction of an immigration officer when \ndenied time to prepare or the assistance of counsel, family, or friends. \n236.  Those who have been continuously present for more than 14 days but less than two \nyears also face substantial risk of wrongful detention or removal under the July 23 Notice.  The \napplication of expedited removal to the interior of the country—far from any land border— \nincreases the likelihood that individuals who are eligible for relief from removal will be swept up \nin raids or other enforcement actions and mistakenly or arbitrarily subjected to expedited removal.  \nThese individuals—including the Individual Plaintiffs here—will frequently have cognizable \ndefenses to removal, which could potentially include (but are not limited to) asylum claims, \neligibility for Special Immigrant Juvenile Status, a pending application for permanent residence \nbased on marriage to a U.S. citizen,13 grounds for a humanitarian stay of removal, and more.  Yet \nbecause of the procedural defects of the expedited removal process, they will be unable to assert \n(or have a very hard time asserting, in the case of asylum) these defenses if they are placed into \nexpedited removal instead of having the opportunity to appear before an IJ, as they would have \nbeen able to do before the July 23 Notice.  Applying expedited removal to such a broad group of \nindividuals who have significant ties to the United States will exacerbate the existing widespread, \nsystemic violations of constitutional, statutory, and regulatory rights in the expedited removal \nprocess. \n                                                \n13 Indeed, another federal court has certified a class of immigrants who were detained by ICE for \ndeportation when they arrived at USCIS for interviews to approve their legal residency based on \ntheir marriage to a citizen.  See Calderon Jimenez v. Cronen, Case No. 1:18-cv-10225 MLW, ECF \nNo. 253 (D. Mass. May 17, 2019).  An individual placed into expedited removal would not have \nthe opportunity to prove that ICE violated its duty, recognized in the Calderon Jiminez case, to \nconsider their application for legal status before making a removal decision. See Calderon Jimenez \nv. Cronen, Case No. 1:18-cv-10225 MLW, ECF No. 340 (D. Mass. Aug. 7, 2019). \n55 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 56 of 73\nV.  HARM TO INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFFS \n237.  The government’s use of expedited removal as described in the July 23 Notice \nwould cause the Individual Plaintiffs to suffer immediate and irreparable injuries to their rights \nunder the United States Constitution and federal law, as well as their property and dignitary \ninterests. \n238.  People who are present in the United States, whether or not their presence is \nauthorized by the INA, have constitutional due process rights to life, liberty, and property, and to \nprocedural protections to safeguard those rights.   \n239.  The expedited removal process lacks basic procedural protections to safeguard the \nconstitutional and statutory rights of individuals who have developed ties to this country. \n240.  The constitutional right to liberty encompasses the right to be free from detention \nor removal that is arbitrary, discriminatory, and/or unauthorized by law. \n241.  The attempted expansion of expedited removal threatens to deprive the Individual \nPlaintiffs of the opportunity to appear in immigration court and to apply for immigration protection \nand relief to which they may be entitled under federal law.  For example, almost all of the \nIndividual Plaintiffs fear that the new policy would deprive them of the chance to apply for asylum \nand/or appear in immigration court to seek relief from removal because they are afraid to return to \ntheir home countries.   \n242.  Indeed, five of the Individual Plaintiffs specifically informed immigration officers \nof their desire to apply for asylum or their fear of persecution in their home countries when they \nwere detained, but three of them (60%) were not actually referred for a CFI.  Given that the failure \nto consistently refer individuals who have expressed a fear of return to a CFI is a known pitfall in \nthe expedited removal process, these Individual Plaintiffs reasonably fear that their expressions of \nintent to apply for asylum will again be ignored.  The pervasive shortcomings in the expedited \n56 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 57 of 73\nremoval process for individuals claiming fear of persecution thus threatens to deprive D. Doe, C. \nLoe, and R. Koe (and potentially other Individual Plaintiffs) of a meaningful opportunity to \nvindicate their asylum claims. \n243.  The attempted expansion of expedited removal may also cause the Individual \nPlaintiffs to experience significant physical harm—and even death—if returned to their home \ncountries without the opportunity to present their case to an immigration court.  Many of the \nIndividual Plaintiffs were pursued by gangs in their home countries, even after they tried to seek \npolice protection or tried to get away within their countries. \n244.  Many of the Individual Plaintiffs have been in the United States for a significant \nperiod of time, and have developed extensive connections to the community.  For example, many \nof the Individual Plaintiffs are involved in local churches, and the children are attending school in \nMassachusetts.   \n245.  D. Doe, C. Doe, and M.J. Doe are teenagers.  Although they are statutorily exempt \nfrom expedited removal, the July 23 Notice threatens to deprive them of their right to full Section \n240 proceedings, because the lack of due process in the expedited removal system poses a serious \nrisk that they will be misclassified as adults. \n246.  Additionally, if D. Doe were removed, he would be deprived of the opportunity to \nfile a grievance regarding the immigration officer who physically assaulted him while he was \ndetained. \n247.  Removing a person who has a colorable defense to removal without providing a \nfair opportunity to prove their defense violates that person’s rights. \n248.  The government’s use of expedited removal will also force the Individual Plaintiffs \nto prepare for imminent removal, where otherwise they would have had the protections of a full \n57 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 58 of 73\nremoval process, including notice and an opportunity to be heard.  Individual Plaintiffs will incur \ncosts to ensure that their property rights, family relationships, and other obligations are protected.  \nThese financial burdens will decrease the overall resources available to Individual Plaintiffs, their \nfamilies, and other similarly situated individuals throughout the country. \n249.  The Individual Plaintiffs are already feeling the effects of this change in policy on \ntheir daily lives.  The Individual Plaintiffs are fearful to go about the activities of their daily lives \nbecause  of  the  possibility  of  being  detained  and then  summarily  removed—and  potentially \nseparated from their parents/children14—without any meaningful chance to defend themselves or \neven  provide  notice  to  their  loved  ones.    ICE  is  known  to  detain  people  at  hospitals,15 \ncourthouses,16 and even when parents are dropping children off at school.17  The Individual \nPlaintiffs now experience increased stress while doing even routine activities such as these because \nof the prospect that they could be placed in expedited removal at any moment.  For example, D. \nDoe is afraid to leave his house except to go to school. \n250.  Further, because the Trump Administration’s attempted expansion of expedited \nremoval was infected by discrimination, this new policy stigmatizes the Individual Plaintiffs and \nother immigrants of color, particularly Latinos, as well as their children and families, and imposes \n                                                \n14 See, e.g., Diane Gallagher, After Mississippi ICE Raids, Some Affected Children Still Are \nWithout a Parent, CNN (Aug. 16, 2019), https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/16/us/mississippi-ice-\nraids-children-separated/index.html. \n15 See, e.g., Shannon Dooling, American Medical Association Takes Stance Against ICE Patrolling \nInside Hospitals, WBUR (Nov. 15, 2017), https://www.wbur.org/news/2017/11/15/ama-stand-\nice-in-hospitals. \n16 See, e.g., Scott Bixby, ICE Courthouse Arrests Up 1700% Since Trump’s Inauguration: Report, \nThe Daily Beast (Jan. 28, 2019), https://www.thedailybeast.com/report-ice-arrests-at-courthouses-\nup-1700-since-trumps-inauguration. \n17 See, e.g., Andreas Castillo, Immigrant Arrested by ICE After Dropping Daughter Off at School, \nSending  Shockwaves  Through  Neighborhood,  L.A.

The expansion of expedited removal triggers and fuels social stigma, \nharassment, discrimination, and even violence against immigrants of color.  The Individual \nPlaintiffs live in fear that they or their children will be harassed or even attacked by people who \nhave been led to believe, by the Administration’s policy and related statements, that the Individual \nPlaintiffs are part of an “infestation”18 that needs to be purged from this country. \nVI.  HARM TO ORGANIZATIONAL PLAINTIFFS AND THEIR MEMBERS \n251.  Plaintiff Centro Presente is a nonprofit membership-based organization based in \nEast Boston, Massachusetts.  \n252.  Centro Presente has over 1,500 members residing throughout Massachusetts.   Most \nof its members are from El Salvador and Honduras. \n253.  Plaintiff  PVWC  is  a  nonprofit  member-ship  based  organization  based  in \nNorthampton, Massachusetts. \n254.  PVWC has over 3,000 active members across western Massachusetts. \n255.  The Organizational Plaintiffs’ members include noncitizens who have not been \nadmitted or paroled into the United States and who have been continuously present for between \ntwo weeks and two years, and are subject to the July 23 Notice expanding expedited removal.   \n256.  The Organizational Plaintiffs also have numerous members who have lived in the \ncountry for longer than two years, but would have difficulty affirmatively demonstrating two years \nof physical presence if erroneously placed in expedited removal proceedings.  These members fear \nerroneous  placement  in  expedited  removal  proceedings  because  of  the  July  23  Notice’s \n                                                \n18 See supra ¶ 220. \n59 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 60 of 73\nrequirement that they affirmatively prove two years of continuous presence to the satisfaction of \nan immigration officer. \n257.  Organizational Plaintiff Centro Presente has noncitizen members who have been \nsubject to enforcement activities by DHS in the metropolitan Boston area.  Those enforcement \nactions occur in various ways, including surveillance and arrests at courthouses, buses, trains, as \nwell as raids on workplaces and homes.  These enforcement actions also result in the detention of \nfamily members who may be present at the time of an arrest or raid. \n258.  Each of the Individual Plaintiffs is a member of Centro Presente and, as discussed \nabove, each is subject to the July 23 Notice.   \n259.  Plaintiff PVWC has noncitizen members who have been subject to enforcement \nactivities by DHS in the western Massachusetts area.  Those enforcement actions occur in various \nways,  including  surveillance  and  arrests  at  courthouses,  buses,  trains,  as  well  as  raids  on \nworkplaces and homes.  These enforcement actions result in the detention of family members who \nmay be present at the time of an arrest or raid.   \n260.  Centro Presente’s and PVWC’s members face an imminent threat of being placed \nin expedited removal because the July 23 Notice, by its own terms, applies immediately and \nbroadly, and Defendants have represented that implementation of the July 23 Notice will begin on \nSeptember 27, 2019.  See Make the Road New York, et al. v. Kevin McAleenan, et al., No. 19-cv-\n02369, ECF No. 31 at 1 (D.D.C. September 10, 2019). \n261.  The effect of the July 23 Notice on Centro Presente’s and PVWC’s members who \nare newly subject to expedited removal, as well as to those who are not properly subject to \nexpedited removal but fear erroneous placement, will be to chill their freedom of movement, and \nfreedom to access public spaces and government offices where immigration officers may be \n60 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 61 of 73\npresent.  These individuals now face a heightened fear that any encounter with an immigration \nofficer  could  result  in  their  immediate  deportation,  without  any  access  to  basic  procedural \nmechanisms designed to protect them against error. \n262.  Before the July 23 Notice, almost all of Centro Presente’s and PVWC’s members \nwould have been provided much more time and extensive procedures before being deported. \n263.  Under the July 23 Notice, any encounter with an immigration officer could end \nwith Centro Presente’s and PVWC’s  members  being deported, without ever speaking to an \nattorney or family member, or having a meaningful opportunity to challenge removal or apply for \nrelief.  Centro Presente’s and PVWC’s members could also face mandatory detention, with no \nability  to  go  before  an  immigration  judge  and  request  release.    See  8  U.S.C.  § \n1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(IV); 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(2)(iii). \n264.  The interests this lawsuit seeks to protect are germane to Centro Presente’s and \nPVWC’s purposes.  As discussed above, Centro Presente advocates for immigrant rights and for \neconomic and social justice.  Similarly, PVWC leads campaigns to improve wages and standards \nand achieve long-term systemic change for immigrants.  PVWC further seeks to transform systems \nand institutions that exploit workers and threaten immigrants, locally to nationally. \n265.  The expansion of expedited removal requires the Organizational Plaintiffs to divert \nthe time and resources of their staff that would otherwise be dedicated to assisting noncitizens in \napplying for forms of relief and in supporting Centro Presente’s and PVWC’s core missions of \nbuilding the power of immigrant communities.  For example, the Organizational Plaintiffs would \nneed  to  divert  resources  away  from  their  legislative  efforts,  ESL  classes,  legal  services, \nimmigration clinics, advocacy, and leadership development. \n61 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 62 of 73\n266.  The  Organizational  Plaintiffs  are  also  harmed  because  it  is  their  mission  to \nempower immigrant communities to understand and assert their fundamental rights, including the \nright to remain silent. The Organizational Plaintiffs’ public-facing materials and trainings on \nimmigrant rights often counsel that immigrants may  invoke the right to remain  silent. The \nexpansion of expedited removal necessitates a wholesale revisiting of these training materials—\nand the legal trainings that members, organizers and others receive—because individuals who \nexercise their right to remain silent now face the possibility of wrongful placement into expedited \nremoval, whether due to failure to assert a fear; failure to explain their manner of entry; or failure \nto affirmatively establish two years of presence. \n267.  The Organizational Plaintiffs have assisted many families in Massachusetts who \nhave had a loved one detained by ICE.  In addition, under the present administration, ICE regularly \ndetains  so-called  “collateral”  individuals  when  conducting  home  raids.    These  detentions \ndemonstrate the high risk of ICE detention faced by the Organizational Plaintiffs’ members and \nall undocumented immigrants. \n268.  If DHS had properly engaged in notice-and-comment rulemaking prior to issuing \nthe July 23 Notice, the Organizational Plaintiffs would have submitted comments to bring to the \nagency’s attention many of the problems with expanding the expedited removal process discussed \nherein. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation of the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause) \n269.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein. \n270.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides \nthat “[n]o person shall . . . be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” \n62 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 63 of 73\n271.  Individual Plaintiffs have a constitutionally protected liberty interest in being free \nfrom detention and/or removal that is arbitrary, discriminatory, and/or unauthorized by law. \n272.  The  July  23  Notice  deprives  Individual  Plaintiffs  of  the  process  they  are \nconstitutionally due to protect this interest.  Expedited removal proceedings fail to provide the \nnecessary procedures to allow Individual Plaintiffs the opportunity to prove that their detention or \nremoval is arbitrary, discriminatory, and/or unauthorized by law. \n273.  The  July  23  Notice  further  subjects  Individual  Plaintiffs  to  a  fatally  biased \ndecisionmaking process, in violation of their constitutional right to due process, because the sole \ndecisionmaker in expedited removal proceedings, namely a DHS immigration officer, is engaged \nin both executive and adjudicative functions. \n274.  Organizational Plaintiffs’ members who are at risk of being subjected to expedited \nremoval are likewise entitled under the Due Process Clause to meaningful process to protect their \nliberty  interest  in  being  free  from  executive  detention  and/or  removal  that  is  arbitrary, \ndiscriminatory, and/or unauthorized by law. \n275.  The July 23 Notice violates the Due Process Clause. \n276.  To the  extent that the  INA,  8  U.S.C.  §  1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I)-(II),  purports to \nauthorize the Secretary to promulgate the July 23 Notice, that provision of the statute likewise \nviolates the Due Process Clause. \n277.  In  the  alternative,  the  canon  of  constitutional  avoidance  requires  8  U.S.C.  § \n1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II) to be construed in a  manner that does not raise serious constitutional \nquestions under the Due Process Clause.  If the statute is construed to comport with the Due \nProcess Clause, then the statute does not authorize the Secretary to promulgate the July 23 Notice \n63 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 64 of 73\nor any other substantially equivalent notice or rule, because the Notice violates the Due Process \nClause.  See infra ¶¶ 294-96. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation of Fifth Amendment Equal Protection) \n278.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein. \n279.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment incorporates the equal protection \nprinciples of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Sessions v. Morales-Santana, 137 S. Ct. 1678, 1686 n.1 \n(2017); see also United States v. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. 2675, 2693 (2013) (citing Bolling v. Sharpe, \n347 U.S. 497 (1954)). \n280.  Defendants’  decision  to  expand  expedited  removal  against  undocumented \nimmigrants living in the United States for greater than fourteen days but less than two years \nviolates the Fifth Amendment because it constitutes intentional discrimination against Mexican, \nCentral American, and South American immigrants on the basis of race, ethnicity, and/or national \norigin. \n281.  The inference of race, ethnicity, and/or national origin discrimination is supported \nby the Trump Administration’s departure from the normal decision-making process; the fact that \nthe decisions bear more heavily on disparaged minority races than others; the sequence of events \nleading to the decisions; the contemporaneous statements of decisionmakers; and the historical \nbackground of the decisions.  The Supreme Court has recognized these factors as probative of \nintentional discrimination.  See Village of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Development Corp., \n429 U.S. 252, 266-68 (1977). \n64 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 65 of 73\n282.  The inference of race, ethnicity, and/or national origin discrimination is supported \nby the departure from the standard rulemaking procedure.  The Defendants deviated from the \nstandard procedure by promulgating a policy that claims to be  immediately effective upon \npublication, without an opportunity for public notice and comment. \n283.  The  inference  of  race,  ethnicity,  and/or  national  origin  discrimination  is  also \nsupported by President Trump’s, Acting Director McAleenan’s, and Acting Director Cuccinelli’s \ncomments as detailed in paragraphs 212 & 219-25, supra. \n284.  The  inference  of  race,  ethnicity,  and/or  national  origin  discrimination  is  also \nsupported by the disparate impact the expansion of expedited removal has on immigrants from \nMexico,  Central  America,  and  South  America.  The  application  of  expedited  removal  has \nhistorically targeted immigrants from Mexico, Central America, and South America.  Any increase \nin expedited removal will disparately impact immigrants from these countries. \n285.  As a direct and proximate result of the expansion of expedited removal by the \nDefendants,  Plaintiffs  have  been  deprived  of  their  equal  protection  rights  under  the  Fifth \nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution. \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 553) \n286.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein. \n287.  The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 553, requires that agencies provide \npublic notice of, and opportunity to comment on, legislative rules before their promulgation.  See \n5 U.S.C. §§ 553(b), (c). The APA also requires that any substantive rule must be published at least \n30 days prior to its effective date.  See 5 U.S.C. § 553(d). \n65 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 66 of 73\n288.  Although styled as a “Notice,” the July 23 Notice is a legislative rule within the \nmeaning of the APA. \n289.  DHS did not comply with the APA’s procedural requirements when it made the \nJuly 23 Notice immediately effective upon publication. \n290.  DHS did not have good cause for its failure to follow the APA’s procedural \nrequirements, as following those requirements would not have been “impracticable, unnecessary, \nor contrary to the public interest.”  5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(3)(B); see also 5 U.S.C. § 553(d).  \n291.  Defendants’ failure to provide for notice and comment violates 5 U.S.C. § 553(b) \nand (c). \n292.  Defendants’ failure to publish the July 23 Notice at least thirty days before its \neffective date violates 5 U.S.C. § 553(d). \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1225(a), (b)(1); \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)) \n293.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein. \n294.  The expansion of expedited removal denies people a meaningful process before \nthey are removed from the United States.  A meaningful process includes, inter alia, an opportunity \nto gather evidence necessary to establish they are not inadmissible and have been continuously \npresent in the United States for more than two years, and an opportunity to consult or rely on the \naid of others, including counsel, to otherwise challenge the application of expedited removal. \n295.  If the expedited removal provisions of the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1225(a), (b)(1), are not \ninterpreted to provide a meaningful process, they would raise serious constitutional questions. \n66 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 67 of 73\n296.  The July 23 Notice therefore violates those sections of the INA, when properly \nconstrued, because it deprives persons faced with expedited removal of minimal procedures \nnecessary to ensure that the statute is administered fairly and consistent with constitutional due \nprocess. \n297.  The July 23 Notice therefore also violates the APA because it is “not in accordance \nwith law,” “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right,” \nand “without observance of procedure required by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C), (D). \nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1362; Administrative \nProcedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 555(b), 706(1), (2)) \n298.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein. \n299.  The expedited removal process denies people a meaningful opportunity to consult \nwith counsel  in connection with any  step  in the process other than preparation  for a CFI.  \nIndividuals subject to expedited removal are not afforded an opportunity to consult with counsel \nregarding the immigration officer’s determination of the person’s inadmissibility or removability. \n300.  The  INA  generally  provides  that  “[i]n  any  removal  proceedings  before  an \nimmigration judge,” the individual “shall have the privilege of being represented.”  8 U.S.C. § \n1362.  Section 1362 does not, by its terms, exempt expedited removal proceedings.  Therefore, at \nleast where an asylum seeker requests review of a negative CFI determination before an IJ, the \nINA should be interpreted to confer on them the right to representation by counsel of their own \nchoosing. \n301.  The APA, 5 U.S.C. § 555(b), provides that “[a] person compelled to appear in \nperson before an agency or representative thereof is entitled to be accompanied, represented, and \n67 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 68 of 73\nadvised by counsel or, if permitted by the agency, by other qualified representative. A party is \nentitled to appear in person or by or with counsel or other duly qualified representative in an agency \nproceeding.”  Individuals subjected to expedited removal procedures are compelled to appear in \nperson before agency representatives.  Congress has not exempted expedited removal proceedings \nfrom this requirement. \n302.  If the July 23 Notice and 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II) are not interpreted to \nprovide a meaningful opportunity to consult with counsel pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1362 and 5 U.S.C. \n§ 555(b), it would raise serious constitutional questions. \n303.  In addition, the July 23 Notice violates the APA because the denial of a meaningful \nopportunity to consult with counsel constitutes agency action “unlawfully withheld,” “not in \naccordance with law,” “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of \nstatutory right,” and “without observance of procedure required by law . . . .”  5 U.S.C. § 706(1), \n(2)(A), (2)(C), (2)(D). \nSIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)) \n304.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein. \n305.  The APA provides that courts “shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency action” \nthat is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n306.  Among other reasons, the July 23 Notice is arbitrary and capricious because, in \nadopting it, Defendants have failed to articulate a reasoned explanation for their decision, which \nrepresents a change in the agency’s longstanding policy; entirely failed to consider important \n68 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 69 of 73\naspects of the problem; and offered explanations for their decision that run counter to the evidence \nbefore the agency. \nSEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation of the Suspension Clause) \n307.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein. \n308.  The Suspension Clause of the U.S. Constitution provides that the “Privilege of the \nWrit of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the \npublic Safety may require it.”  U.S. Const. Art. 1, § 9, cl. 2. \n309.  The  July  23  Notice  subjects  the  Individual  Plaintiffs  and  members  of  the \nOrganizational Plaintiffs to expedited removal without the availability of federal court habeas \ncorpus review of an expedited removal order, other than with respect to the three specific factual \ndeterminations listed in 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(2) pertaining to alienage, the existence of an order, and \nwhether the individual was lawfully admitted for permanent residence, admitted as a refugee, or \ngranted asylum. \n310.  The INA does not otherwise provide an adequate and effective alternative to federal \ncourt habeas corpus review of an order of expedited removal. \n311.  At a constitutional minimum, individuals subject to executive detention—including \nvia expedited removal proceedings—must be able to challenge whether they were detained and/or \nremoved pursuant to an erroneous interpretation or application of relevant law.  See Boumediene \nv. Bush, 553 U.S. 723, 779 (2008). \n312.  Depriving individuals of the right to seek judicial habeas corpus review of an \nexpedited removal order, other than regarding those three limited factual questions, therefore \neffects a suspension of the writ, which violates the Suspension Clause. \n69 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 70 of 73\nEIGHTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation of the Appointments Clause and 6 U.S.C. § 112) \n313.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein. \n314.  The Appointments clause of the U.S. Constitution provides, in relevant part, that \nthe President “shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint \nambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, judges of the Supreme Court, and all other \nofficers of the United States, whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which \nshall be established by law: but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior \nofficers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the courts of law, or in the heads of \ndepartments.”  U.S. Const. Art. 2, § 2, cl. 2. \n315.  Pursuant to 6 U.S.C. § 112, “[t]here is a Secretary of Homeland Security, appointed \nby the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.” \n316.  Pursuant to the Federal Vacancies Reform Act (“FVRA”), 5 U.S.C. § 3348(d), \n“[a]ny Action taken by any person who is not acting under section 3345, 3346, or 3347, or as \nprovided by subsection (b), in the performance of any function or duty of a vacant office to which \nthis section and sections 3346, 3347, 3349, 3349a, 3349b, and 3349c apply shall have no force or \neffect.” \n317.  The Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security is not an inferior officer, \nbecause such officer reports directly to the President. \n318.  President Trump did not seek or obtain the advice and consent of the Senate before \nappointing Kevin McAleenan as Acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, \nthereby violating both the Appointments Clause and 6 U.S.C. § 112. \n70 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 71 of 73\n319.  On information and belief, President Trump intends for Defendant McAleenan to \nperform the functions and duties of Secretary of DHS indefinitely. \n320.  On information and belief, President Trump appointed Defendant McAleenan as \nActing Secretary of DHS for the unlawful purpose of circumventing the Senate’s mandatory role \nin the appointment of the USCIS Director.  President Trump has explicitly stated that he prefers to \nappoint acting officials because it is more expedient than Senate confirmation.  See, e.g., Felicia \nSonmez, Trump Says He's ‘in No Hurry’ to Replace Acting Cabinet Members, Wash. Post (Jan. 6, \n2019),  https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-says-hes-in-no-hurry-to-replace-acting-\ncabinet-members/2019/0l/06/afac5fea-11e4-l le9-b6ad-9cfd62dbb0a8_story.html (“Well, I’m in \nno hurry. I have ‘acting.’ . . . I sort of like ‘acting.’  It gives me more flexibility”); Randall Lane, \nInside Trump’s Head: An Exclusive Interview with the President, and the Single Theory That \nExplains Everything, Forbes (Oct. 10, 2017), https://www.forbes.com/donald-trump/exclusive-\ninterview/#501570b4bdec (“I’m generally not going to make a lot of appointments that would \nnormally be [confirmed by the Senate]—because you don’t need them.”). \n321.  Over the past two and a half years, President Trump has named 28 acting cabinet \nsecretaries, of whom 25 have served for more than 10 days—both more than any of the past five \npresidents did in their four to eight years in office.  These acting officials have served an average \nof 50 days, which is also longer than the average for any of those five presidents.  See Anne Joseph \nO’Connell, Acting Leaders: Recent Practices, Consequences, and Reforms, Brookings Institution \n(July 22, 2019), https://www.brookings.edu/research/acting-leaders/. \n322.  The President has particularly placed immigration and national security policy in \nthe hands of acting officials.  As of July 2019, only 41% of Senate-confirmed positions were filled \nat the Department of Homeland Security.  See Editorial Board, An Administration of Temps, \n71 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02840   Document 1   Filed 09/20/19   Page 72 of 73\nBloomberg  Opinion  (July  25,  2019),  https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-07-\n25/trump-s-washington-has-an-acting-officials-problem.  Notably, all of the Defendants in this \naction are acting officials, except for Attorney General Barr. \n323.  These actions undermine accountable governance by purposefully bypassing the \nscrutiny of the Senate. \n324.  Defendant McAleenan’s purported exercise of the authority of the Secretary of \nDHS is unconstitutional because it is in derogation of the Senate’s constitutional authority and \nresponsibility to provide its advice and consent in the appointment of officers of the United States. \n325.  To the extent that the FVRA permits the President to appoint a principal officer \nwithout the advice and consent of the Senate, it violates the Appointments Clause. \n326.  Because Acting Secretary McAleenan was not properly appointed as Secretary of \nHomeland Security, the July 23 Notice has no force or effect. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray this Court to: \na.
