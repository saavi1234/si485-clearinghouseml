    "summary": "<p>On May 31, 2017, former detainees at the Otay Mesa Detention Center filed this lawsuit as a putative class action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. The plaintiffs sued CoreCivic, Inc. under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) and state law. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, sought declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief. The plaintiffs alleged that CoreCivic had a practice of paying detainees at the Otay Mesa Detention Center only one dollar a day if they volunteered to perform certain jobs and services. The plaintiffs also alleged that, in other instances, CoreCivic forced detainees to perform various forms of manual labor for no compensation at all.</p>\r\n<p>The defendant moved to dismiss the complaint on August 11, 2017. The defendant alleged that the plaintiff had failed to state a claim under the TVPA for which relief could be granted, and alleged that the plaintiff&rsquo;s state law claims were preempted by federal law.</p>\r\n<p>On January 22, 2018, the plaintiffs in <a href=\"../../../../case/17385/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gonzalez v. CoreCivic, Inc.</a>&nbsp;moved to consolidate the two cases due to legal and factual similarities between them. On February 23, 2018, the plaintiffs in this case moved to intervene in order to oppose consolidation. The court granted the motion to intervene and, on April 4, 2018, denied the <em>Gonzalez</em> plaintiffs&rsquo; motion to consolidate, staying&nbsp;<em>Gonzalez</em> pending resolution of this case.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On May 14, 2018, the judge in <em>Owino </em>lifted the stay that it had imposed pending resolution of the consolidation issue and denied the defendant&rsquo;s motion to dismiss in part, and granted it in part. The plaintiffs&rsquo; TVPA claim remained largely intact, and was dismissed only to the extent that it alleged violations of a particular amendment to the TVPA that occurred prior to the amendment&rsquo;s enactment in December 2008.</p>\r\n<p>While the parties litigated various discovery issues, the plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint on October 12, 2018, asserting additional claims of negligence and unjust enrichment against CoreCivic. On April 15, 2019, the plaintiff's requested to certify a class.</p>\r\n<p>On June 5, 2019, the plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment on its claims under the California Labor Code. But on July 11, 2019, the defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings.</p>\r\n<p>On April 1, 2020, Judge Janis Sammartino issued an order denying the plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment, denying the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, and granting in part the motion for class certification. Judge Sammartino concluded that summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs was inappropriate because class certification had not yet been granted and \"the one-way intervention rule typically precludes a court from ruling on a merits-based motion before the class is certified and notified.\" Furthermore, Judge Sammartino denied the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings because defendant failed to assert its personal jurisdiction defense in its first responsive pleadings, thus waiving the right to that defense. 2020 WL 1550218.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Sammartino granted certification to three classes: (1) The California Forced Labor Class, comprised of ICE detainees who were detained at a CoreCivic facility located in California after January 1, 2006 and cleaned areas of the facilities above and beyond personal housekeeping standards and performed such work under threat of discipline irrespective of whether the work was paid or unpaid; (2) The National Forced Labor Class, comprised of ICE detainees in CoreCivic facilities after December 23, 2008 who cleaned areas of the facilities above and beyond personal housekeeping standards and performed such work under threat of discipline irrespective of whether the work was paid or unpaid; and (3) The California Labor Law Class, \"comprised of '[a]ll ICE detainees who (i) were detained at a CoreCivic facility located in California between May 31, 2013 and the present, and (ii) worked through CoreCivic's Voluntary Work Program during their period of detention in California.\" 2020 WL 1550218.</p>\r\n<p>Two weeks later, the defendants moved for reconsideration, which was denied by Judge Sammartino on January 13, 2021. In early March, the Ninth Circuit granted CoreCivic's petition for permission to appeal the district court's April 1 order granting class certification and the order denying reconsideration. On July 28, 2021, the district court stayed all proceedings apart from an ongoing discovery dispute pending the appeal. Two days later, the court resolved the discovery dispute, ordering CoreCivic to broaden and prioritize its discovery production.</p>\r\n<p>On June 3, 2022, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's certification of the three classes but reversed the district court's finding that CoreCivic had waived its personal jurisdiction challenge as to the National Forced Labor Class, remanding for consideration of jurisdiction in the district court. An amended appellate decision issued on December 20, 2022. 60 F.4th 437. Thereafter, CoreCivic sought and was, on December 20, 2022, denied rehearing en banc in the appellate court and, on June 12, 2023, a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court. Thereafter, proceedings resumed in the district court, and CoreCivic filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, which the court construed and considered as a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. On November 2, 2023, the court denied CoreCivic's motion, reasoning that because it could exercise specific jurisdiction over the claims of the named plaintiff, it could exercise personal jurisdiction over the claims of the class as a whole.&nbsp; The parties proceeded with discovery.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On March 22, 2024, CoreCivic filed a motion to stay the case, citing the consolidated appeal pending in the Ninth Circuit in <a href=\"../../../../case/16361/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Washington v. The GEO Group, Inc.</a><em>&nbsp;</em>and <a href=\"../../../../case/16387/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chen v. GEO</a>.&nbsp; On May 6, 2024, the court granted the stay as to the filing of dispositive motions related to state law claims subject to the constitutional defenses (Supremacy Clause) at issue in that appeal, but denied the stay in all other respects.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As of December 2024, discovery is ongoing.&nbsp;</p>",

The plaintiffs alleged that they had been forced to work for $1 per day and sometimes for no pay at all. Plaintiffs in Gonzalez alleged similar facts, and the case was stayed pending resolution in Owino. In April 2020, the Court denied the plaintiff's motions for partial summary judgment and the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings. CoreCivic appealed the district court's decisions granting class certification and denying a motion to reconsider the court's earlier denial of its motion for judgment on the pleadings. As of March 26, 2022, the appeal was pending before the Ninth Circuit, with district court proceedings stayed.",

Defendant contests the Courtโs exercise \n3  of personal jurisdiction over it with respect to claims by class members detained outside of \n4  California.  Defโs Mem. Supp. Renewed Mot. at 1, ECF No. 262-1 (the โMem.โ).  The \n5  Court vacated the hearing on Defendantโs Motion and took it under submission pursuant \n6  to Civil Local Rule 7.1(d)(1).  See ECF No. 270.  Having carefully considered the Partiesโ \n7  arguments, the evidence, and the law, the Court DENIES Defendantโs Motion.   \n8  BACKGROUND \n9    As the Parties are familiar with the facts, the Court incorporates by reference the \n10  factual and procedural background set forth in this Courtโs April 1, 2020 Order (the \n11  โOrder,โ ECF No. 179 at 2โ4), and states here only the additional background relevant to \n12  the present Motion.  \n13    On April 1, 2020, the Court certified three classes in the instant litigation.  Order at \n14  59.  The Court first certified a California Forced Labor Class of โ[a]ll ICE detainees who \n15  (i) were detained at a CoreCivic facility located in California between January 1, 2006 and \n16  the present, (ii) cleaned areas of the facilities above and beyond the personal housekeeping \n17  tasks enumerated in ICEโs Performance Based National Detention Standards 2011 (the \n18  โICE PBNDSโ), and (iii) performed such work under threat of discipline irrespective of \n19  whether the work was paid or unpaid.โ  Id. at 12, 59 (alteration in original) (internal \n20  quotation marks omitted) (quoting ECF No. 84 (the โCertification Mot.โ) at 1).  Next, the \n21  Court certified a National Forced Labor Class that mirrors the California Forced Labor \n22  Class but includes ICE detainees held at any of Defendantโs facilities since December 23, \n23  2008.  Id.  Lastly, the Court partially certified a California Labor Law Class comprised of \n24  โ[a]ll ICE detainees who (i) were detained at a CoreCivic facility located in California \n25  between May 31, 2013 and the present, and (ii) worked through CoreCivicโs [voluntary \n26  work program] during their period of detention in California.โ Id. (first alteration in \n27  original) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Certification Mot. at 1).  The Court \n28  certified this final class only with respect to โthe causes of action for failure to pay \n2 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (SBC) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 274   Filed 11/02/23   PageID.9906   Page 3 of 16\n \n1  minimum wage, failure to provide wage statements for actual damages, failure to pay \n2  compensation upon termination, and imposition of unlawful conditions of employment.โ  \n3  Id. at 59.  \n4    In  the  Order,  the  Court  also  denied  Defendantโs  Motion  for  Judgment  on  the \n5  Pleadings (โMJP,โ ECF No. 117), Order at 8โ10, wherein Defendant โmove[d] this Court, \n6  pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c)[,] to . . . dismiss all putative class claims that arose outside \n7  of California for lack of personal jurisdiction,โ MJP at 2.  The Court concluded that \n8  Defendant had waived its challenge to the Courtโs jurisdiction.  Order at 10.  \n9  Defendant moved for reconsideration of the Order.  See ECF No. 181.  After the \n10  Court denied reconsideration on January 13, 2021, see ECF No. 210, Defendant petitioned \n11  the Ninth Circuit for permission to appeal.  See ECF No. 212.  The Ninth Circuit granted \n12  Defendantโs request on March 10, 2021, with respect to this Courtโs certification of the \n13  class and this Courtโs denial of reconsideration, see ECF No. 216, and this Court stayed \n14  the litigation in part pending Defendantโs appeal, see ECF Nos. 220, 224. \n15    On December 20, 2022, the Ninth Circuit issued an Order and Amended Opinion \n16  largely affirming the Courtโs April 1, 2020 and January 13, 2021 Orders.  See ECF No. 249.  \n17  In its Amended Opinion, the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded only the Courtโs denial \n18  of Defendantโs MJP.  Id. at 18, 25.  Relying on an opinion issued while the appeal was \n19  pendingโMoser  v.  Benefytt,  Inc.,  8  F.4th  872  (9th  Cir.  2021)โthe  Ninth  Circuit \n20  determined that Defendant did not waive its personal jurisdiction defense.  Id. at 18.  The \n21  Ninth Circuit left it to this Court, however, to determine the merits of the defense.  Id.   \n22  After the Supreme Court denied Defendantโs petition for a writ of certiorari, see ECF \n23  No. 253, this Court held an Appeal Mandate Hearing on July 19, 2023, and set a briefing \n24  schedule, see ECF No. 261.  The present Motion followed. \n25  LEGAL STANDARD \n26  I.  Rule 12(i) \n27  Defendant styles their Motion as a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant \n28  to Rule 12(c).  Mot. at 2.  However, โ[a] motionโs โnomenclature is not controlling.โโ  \n3 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (SBC) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 274   Filed 11/02/23   PageID.9907   Page 4 of 16\n \n1  United States ex rel. Hoggett v. Univ. of Phoenix, 863 F.3d 1105, 1108 (9th Cir. 2017) \n2  (quoting Miller v. Transamerican Press, Inc., 709 F.2d 524, 527 (9th Cir. 1983)).  Instead, \n3  courts should โconstrue [the motion], however styled, to be the type proper for the relief \n4  requested.โ  Id. (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Miller, \n5  709 F.2d at 527).  For the reasons that follow, the Court construes Defendantโs Motion as \n6  a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(i).   \n7    Defendants typically bring motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction under \n8  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2).  Rule 12(b), however, bars Defendant from filing \n9  a 12(b)(2) motion at this stage of the litigation.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b) (โA motion \n10  asserting any of these defenses must be made before pleading if a responsive pleading is \n11  allowed.โ).  Here, Defendant did not move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction until \n12  after its first responsive pleading.  See Order at 10.  Thus, Defendant may not file a motion \n13  under Rule 12(b)(2).   \n14    Rule  12(c)  provides  a  vehicle  to  advance  certain  Rule  12(b)  defenses  after  a \n15  responsive pleading has been filed, but it is not clear that 12(b)(2) is among them.  Courts \n16  have interpreted Rule 12(h) to allow a party to raise select 12(b) defensesโfailure to state \n17  a claim, failure to join a required party, and lack of subject matter jurisdictionโby way of \n18  a Rule 12(c) motion, even if that party has already filed a responsive pleading.  See Patel \n19  v. Contemp. Classics of Beverly Hills, 259 F.3d 123, 126 (2d Cir. 2001); 5C Charles Alan \n20  Wright et al., Federal Practice & Procedure ยง 1367 (3d ed. Apr. 2023 update).  The \n21  underlying reasoning is straightforward: Rule 12(h)(1) establishes that 12(b)(1), 12(b)(6), \n22  and 12(b)(7) defenses cannot be waived, and Rule 12(h)(2) identifies โa motion under Rule \n23  12(c)โ as an appropriate means to raise nonwaivable defenses.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h); \n24  Patel, 259 F. 3d at 126.  Rule 12(h), however, does not preserve the 12(b)(2) defense as \n25  nonwaivable.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h).   \n26    Moreover, any effort to adjudicate Defendantโs personal jurisdiction defense through \n27  a Rule 12(c) motion would go against the plain language of Rule 12(d).  When a court rules \n28  on a Rule 12(c) motion asserting a Rule 12(b) defense, it applies the same standard of \n4 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (SBC) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 274   Filed 11/02/23   PageID.9908   Page 5 of 16\n \n1  review it would apply to the analogous Rule 12(b) motion.  Dworkin v. Hustler Mag. Inc., \n2  867 F.2d 1188, 1192 (9th Cir. 1989).  Therefore, this Court would apply Rule 12(b)(2)โs \n3  standard to Defendantโs Motion.  Under this standard, a plaintiff is โobligated to come \n4  forward  with  facts,  by  affidavit  or  otherwise,  supporting  personal  jurisdictionโ  and \n5  โ[can]not simply rest on the bare allegations of its complaint.โ  Amba Mktg. Sys., Inc. v. \n6  Jobar Intโl, Inc., 551 F.2d 784, 787 (9th Cir. 1977).  But if the Court considers such facts \n7  while ruling on Defendantโs Rule 12(c) motion, Rule 12(d) will require the Court to apply \n8  the standard associated with Rule 56.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d) (โIf, on a motion under \n9  Rule . . . 12(c), matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the \n10  court, the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56.โ). \n11    Rather than resort to summary judgment, the Court construes Defendantโs Motion \n12  as a motion for pre-trial adjudication of its personal jurisdiction defense under Rule 12(i).  \n13  See 5C Wright et al., supra, ยง 1361; Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(i) (โIf a party so moves, any defense \n14  listed in Rule 12(b)(1)โ(7) . . . must be heard and decided before trial unless the court \n15  orders a deferral until trial.โ).  Multiple courts have recognized that a defendant mayโ\n16  even after filing a responsive pleadingโmove under Rule 12(i) to request that a court rule \n17  on their properly-preserved personal jurisdiction defense.  See Horton v. SunPath, Ltd., No. \n18  3:23-CV-631-E-BN, 2023 WL 2653386, at *2 (N.D. Tex. Mar. 27, 2023); Branson v. Am. \n19  Intโl Indus., No. 1:15CV73, 2016 WL 3190222, at *4, *6 (M.D.N.C. June 7, 2016). \n20    Resorting to Rule 12(i) allows the Court to apply the same standard it would apply \n21  to a motion under Rule 12(b)(2).  Under Rule 12(i), as under Rule 12(b)(2), the Court may \n22  resolve the issue of personal jurisdiction through either a preponderance of the evidence \n23  standard or a prima facie standard.   See Data Disc, Inc. v. Sys. Tech. Assocs., Inc., \n24  557 F.2d 1280,  1285  &  n.2  (9th  Cir.  1977)  (noting  that,  when  ruling  on  a  personal \n25  jurisdiction defense pursuant to Rule 12(i), a district court โmay decide that the plaintiff \n26  should not be required . . . to meet the higher burden of proof which is associated with the \n27  presentation of evidence at a hearing, but rather should be required only to establish a prima \n28  / / / \n5 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (SBC) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 274   Filed 11/02/23   PageID.9909   Page 6 of 16\n \n1  facie  showing  of  jurisdictional  factsโ)1;  AcryliCon  USA,  LLC  v.  Silikal  GmbH, \n2  985 F.3d 1350, 1364โ65 (11th Cir. 2021). \n3    Because neither Defendant nor Plaintiffs have requested an evidentiary hearing, the \n4  Court  will  determine  only  whether  Plaintiffs  have  made  a  prima  facie  showing  of \n5  jurisdiction.  Under this standard, Plaintiffs, as the party seeking to invoke the Courtโs \n6  jurisdiction, bear the burden of establishing its existence.  Data Disc, 557 F.2d at 1285.  \n7  Where Defendant contests the factual basis underlying the Courtโs exercise of jurisdiction, \n8  Plaintiffs must submit affidavits and discovery materials โdemonstrat[ing] facts which \n9  support  a  finding  of  jurisdiction.โ    Id.    The  Court  otherwise  takes  uncontroverted \n10  allegations  in  the  Complaint  as  true  and  resolves  โ[c]onflicts  between  parties  over \n11  statements contained in affidavits . . . in [Plaintiffsโ] favor.โ  See Schwarzenegger v. Fred \n12  Martin Motor Co., 374 F.3d 797, 800 (9th Cir. 2004) (citing Am. Tel. & Tel. Co. v. \n13  Compagnie Bruxelles Lambert, 94 F.3d 586, 588 (9th Cir.), supplemented, 95 F.3d 1156 \n14  (9th Cir. 1996)). \n15  II.  Personal Jurisdiction \n16  A federal court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant โif a rule or \n17  statute authorizes it to do so and the exercise of such jurisdiction comports with the \n18  constitutional requirements of due process.โ  Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 94 F.3d at 589.  Where \n19  no applicable federal statute governs personal jurisdiction, federal district courts โappl[y] \n20  the law of the state in which [they] sit[].โ  Schwarzenegger, 374 F.3d at 800 (citing Fed. R. \n21  Civ. P. 4(k)(1)(A)).  Because Californiaโs long-arm jurisdictional statute is coextensive \n22  with federal due process requirements, federal courts sitting in California consider only \n23  whether taking personal jurisdiction is consistent with the limits of federal due process.  \n24  See Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.S. 117, 125 (2014) (citing Cal. Civ. Proc. ยง 410.10).  \n25 \n \n26 \n1 The Data Disc court referred to Rule 12(d) in its opinion, 557 F.2d at 1285 n.2, but the 2007 Amendments \n27 \nto the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure relocated the text on preliminary hearings from Rule 12(d) to the \nnewly created Rule 12(i), 5C Wright et al., supra, ยง 1373.  These amendments were intended to have no \n28 \nsubstantive effect on the rules.  Id. \n6 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (SBC) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 274   Filed 11/02/23   PageID.9910   Page 7 of 16\n \n1    A federal courtโs exercise of personal jurisdiction over a defendant comports with \n2  due process if the defendant has minimum contacts with the forum state such that the \n3  maintenance of the suit is reasonable and does not offend traditional notions of fair play \n4  and substantial justice.  Intโl Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316โ17 (1945).  The \n5  analysis evaluates the โrelationship among the defendant, the forum, and the litigation.โ \n6  Daimler, 571 U.S. at 126 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Shaffer v. Heitner, \n7  433 U.S. 186, 204 (1977)).  Its โprimary focus,โ however, is โthe defendantโs relationship \n8  to the forum State,โ or, more specifically, โthe burden on the defendant.โ  Bristol-Myers \n9  Squibb Co. v. Superior Ct., 582 U.S. 255, 262โ63 (2017) (internal quotation marks omitted) \n10  (quoting World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 292 (1980)).  \n11  The Supreme Court has recognized two types of personal jurisdiction: general (all-\n12  purpose) jurisdiction and specific (case-linked) jurisdiction.  See Goodyear Dunlop Tires \n13  Operations,  S.A.  v.  Brown,  564  U.S.  915,  919  (2011).    A  court  may  take  general \n14  jurisdictionโand thereby hear any and all claims against a defendantโif the defendantโs \n15  โaffiliations with the State are so โcontinuous and systematicโ as to render them essentially \n16  at home in the forum State.โ  Id. (quoting Intโl Shoe, 326 U.S. at 317).  Specific jurisdiction, \n17  by contrast, allows a court to exercise jurisdiction over a defendant who has fewer contacts \n18  with  the  forum  state  so  long  as  the plaintiffโs  claims  โarise  out of or relate  toโ  the \n19  defendantโs contacts.  Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 472โ73 (1985) \n20  (quoting Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S.A. v. Hall, 466 U.S. 408, 414 (1984)). \n21  A court may take specific jurisdiction over a claim against a defendant if three \n22  requirements are met:  \n23  (1) the defendant must either โpurposefully direct his activitiesโ toward \nthe  forum  or  โpurposefully  avail[]  himself  of  the  privileges  of \n24 \nconducting activities in the forumโ; (2) โthe claim must be one which \n25  arises out of or relates to the defendantโs forum-related activitiesโ; and \n(3)  โthe  exercise  of  jurisdiction  must  comport  with  fair  play  and \n26 \nsubstantial justice, i.e. it must be reasonable.โ  \n27   \n28  / / / \n7 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (SBC) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 274   Filed 11/02/23   PageID.9911   Page 8 of 16\n \n1  Axiom Foods, Inc. v. Acerchem Intโl, Inc., 874 F.3d 1064, 1068 (9th Cir. 2017) (alteration \n2  in original) (quoting Dole Food Co. v. Watts, 303 F.3d 1104, 1111 (9th Cir. 2002)).  \n3  Plaintiffs bear the burden of proof on the first two prongs, but Defendant shoulders the \n4  burden on the final prong.  Davis v. Cranfield Aerospace Sols., Ltd., 71 F.4th 1154, 1162 \n5  (9th Cir. 2023).  \n6  DISCUSSION \n7    Defendant concedes that the Court may exercise specific jurisdiction over claims by \n8  class members detained within California, including the claims of the two named class \n9  representatives.  See Mem. at 1.  With respect to claims by class members detained outside \n10  of California, however, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate โan affiliation \n11  between  the  forum  and  the  underlying  controversy,  principally,  [an]  activity  or  an \n12  occurrence that takes place in the forum State and is therefore subject to the Stateโs \n13  regulation.โ  Bristol-Myers, 582 U.S. at 262 (alterations and omissions in original) (internal \n14  quotation marks omitted) (quoting Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 919).  In other words, per \n15  Defendants, claims by class members detained outside of California do not arise out of or \n16  relate to Defendantโs California-related activities. \n17  In response, Plaintiffs do not argue that class members detained outside of California \n18  can satisfy Bristol-Myersโ requirementsโi.e., demonstrate that their claims involve an \n19  activity or occurrence taking place in California.  See generally Oppโn.  Instead, Plaintiffs \n20  distinguish Bristol-Myers on the grounds that it involved a mass action, which is more \n21  burdensome for a Defendant to litigate than is a class action.  Id. at 7.  Plaintiffs contend \n22  that if this Court may exercise specific jurisdiction over Defendant with respect to the \n23  claims of the named class representatives, it may also exercise specific jurisdiction over \n24  Defendant with respect to the claims of the class as a whole.  Id.  Put differently, where \n25  jurisdiction over a defendant in a class action is concerned, the only relevant claims are \n26  those of the named class representatives.   \n27  The Court begins its analysis with binding authority.  The Supreme Court has not \n28  yet addressed Plaintiffsโ argument.  See Bristol-Myers, 582 U.S. at 278 n.4 (Sotomayor, J., \n8 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (SBC) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 274   Filed 11/02/23   PageID.9912   Page 9 of 16\n \n1  dissenting) (โThe Court today does not confront the question whether its opinion here \n2  would also apply to a class action in which a plaintiff injured in the forum State seeks to \n3  represent a nationwide class of plaintiffs, not all of whom were injured there.โ).  Neither \n4  has the Ninth Circuit.  See Moser, 8 F.4th at 879 (โAlthough [the defendant] asks us to \n5  resolve [the merits of their Bristol-Myers objection to class certification] now, . . . we leave \n6  that matter for the district court on remand.โ).   \n7  Absent binding authority, the Court turns to persuasive authority from this and other \n8  circuits.  Three federal circuits have so far reached the question as to whether a district \n9  court mustโpursuant to Bristol-Myersโdismiss the claims of nonresident, nonnamed \n10  class members based on the absence of an affiliation between those claims and the forum \n11  state.  All three have held that where the exercise of personal jurisdiction over a class-\n12  action defendant is concerned, the only relevant claims are those of the named class \n13  representatives.  Mussat v. IQVIA, Inc., 953 F.3d 441, 447 (7th Cir. 2020); Lyngaas v. \n14  Curaden AG, 992 F.3d 412, 433โ35 (6th Cir. 2021); Fischer v. Fed. Express Corp., \n15  42 F.4th 366, 375 (3d Cir. 2022).2  And, though they have not reached a consensus in their \n16  reasoning,  the  โvast  majorityโ  of  district  courts  confronting  similar  arguments  have \n17  followed these circuits and declined to dismiss the claims of nonnamed, nonresident class \n18  members.  2 William B. Rubenstein, Newberg and Rubenstein on Class Actions ยง 6:30 (6th \n19  ed. June 2023 update). \n20  The Court is persuaded by the approach of the Seventh, Sixth, and Third Circuits.  \n21  Class actions have long been recognized as an โexceptionโ to โgeneral rulesโ in Anglo-\n22  American jurisprudence.  See Hansberry v. Lee, 311 U.S. 32, 40โ41 (1940); see also Taylor \n23  v. Sturgell, 553 U.S. 880, 884 (2008).  Indeed, the Supreme Court has made it clear that \n24  nonnamed class members โmay be parties for some purposes and not for others,โ as โ[t]he \n25  label โpartyโ does not indicate an absolute characteristic, but rather a conclusion about the \n26 \n \n27 \n2 Though the Fischer court was not required to reach the class action question to resolve the case before \nit, another Third Circuit panel recently confirmed that the Fischer courtโs conclusion is binding law in the \n28 \nThird Circuit.  Kelly v. RealPage Inc., 47 F.4th 202, 211 n.7 (3d Cir. 2022).    \n9 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (SBC) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 274   Filed 11/02/23   PageID.9913   Page 10 of 16\n \n1  applicability of various procedural rules that may differ based on context.โ  Devlin v. \n2  Scardelletti, 536 U.S. 1, 9โ10 (2002).  It is not unusual, therefore, to (1) treat class actions \n3  differently from other forms of litigation and (2) treat nonnamed class members differently \n4  than parties to nonclass litigation.  \n5  This  differential  treatment  carries  over  to  the  personal  jurisdiction  context.  In \n6  Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U.S. 797 (1985), the Supreme Court considered a \n7  defendantโs challenge to a state courtโs power to bind nonnamed class members to its \n8  judgment.  Id. at 802โ03.  The defendant argued that nonnamed class membersโlike \n9  plaintiffs in traditional civil litigationโmust either (1) affirmatively consent to a courtโs \n10  exercise of jurisdiction or (2) maintain sufficient minimum contacts with the forum state \n11  such that the exercise of jurisdiction is reasonable.  Id. at 806.  The Court disagreed, holding \n12  that โ[b]ecause States place fewer burdens upon absent class plaintiffs than they do upon \n13  absent defendants in nonclass suits, the Due Process Clause need not and does not afford \n14  the former as much protection from state-court jurisdiction as it does the latter.โ  Id. at 811.  \n15  In other words, the procedural protections built into class actionsโincluding the โinquiry \n16  into the common nature of the named plaintiffsโ and the absent plaintiffsโ claims,โ see id. \n17  at 809โoffer additional due process protections for nonnamed class members that justify \n18  treating them differently than plaintiffs or defendants in nonclass litigation. \n19  Granted, Shutts did not purport to decide what due process protections defendants \n20  receive in class actions.  See Shutts, 472 U.S. at 811 n.3 (โ[O]ur discussion of personal \n21  jurisdiction [does not] address class actions where the jurisdiction is asserted against a \n22  defendant class.โ); Bristol-Myers, 582 U.S. at 267 (โSince Shutts concerned the due process \n23  rights of plaintiffs, it has no bearing on the question presented here.โ).  But it follows from \n24  Shutts thatโwhere class actions are concernedโthe due process protections to which a \n25  party is entitled with respect to a courtโs exercise of jurisdiction over a claim wax and wane \n26  with the burden the party bears in litigating that claim.  See Shutts, 472 U.S. at 811; \n27  Lyngaas, 992 F.3d at 436 (relying on Shutts to conclude that the โunique posture of a class \n28  actionโ changes the jurisdictional inquiry for plaintiffs and defendants alike).   \n10 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (SBC) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 274   Filed 11/02/23   PageID.9914   Page 11 of 16\n \n1  The  dispositive  question,  therefore,  is  as  follows:  do  Rule  23โs  procedural \n2  requirements reduce the burden defendants bear in litigating the claims of nonnamed class \n3  members enough to substitute for the protection offered by subjecting those claims to a \n4  traditional, โminimum contactsโ analysis? \n5  Numerous federal courtsโincluding this Courtโhave answered this question in the \n6  affirmative.    See,  e.g.,  Sousa  v.  7-Eleven,  Inc.,  No.  19-CV-2142  JLS  (RBB), \n7  2020 WL 6399595, at *4 (S.D. Cal. Nov. 2, 2020) (โ[T]o qualify for class action treatment \n8  under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23, an action must meet additional due process requirements that are \n9  not applicable in the Bristol-Myers mass tort context.โ); Massaro v. Beyond Meat, Inc., No. \n10  3:20-CV-00510-AJB-MSB, 2021 WL 948805, at *11 (S.D. Cal. Mar. 12, 2021) (reasoning \n11  that Rule 23โs requirements ensure โa degree of uniformity and consistency,โ thereby \n12  providing โdue process protections not available in the Bristol-Myers mass tort contextโ);  \n13  Sotomayor v. Bank of Am., N.A., 377 F. Supp. 3d 1034, 1038 (C.D. Cal. 2019) (โFederal \n14  Rule of Civil Procedure 23 imposes additional due process safeguards on class actions that \n15  do not exist in the mass tort context.โ); Molock v. Whole Foods Mkt., Inc., 297 F. Supp. 3d \n16  114, 126 (D.D.C. 2018), affโd on other grounds sub nom. Molock v. Whole Foods Mkt. \n17  Grp., Inc., 952 F.3d 293 (D.C. Cir. 2020); Rosenberg v. LoanDepot.com LLC, 435 F. Supp. \n18  3d 308, 326 (D. Mass. 2020); In re Chinese-Manufactured Drywall Prods. Liab. Litig., No. \n19  MDL 09-2047, 2017 WL 5971622, at *14 (E.D. La. Nov. 30, 2017).  \n20  And, though they have not referred to class action procedures as substitute due \n21  process protections, the Third and Sixth Circuits have similarly concluded that the benefits \n22  defendants  derive  from  said  procedures  justify  treating  nonnamed  class  members  as \n23  irrelevant when determining whether the exercise of specific jurisdiction over a defendant \n24  violates the Constitution.  See Fischer, 42 F.4th at 374 (noting that the unitary, coherent \n25  nature of class action claims justifies treating absent class members in Rule 23 suits as \n26  nonparties for jurisdictional purposes); Lyngaas, 992 F.3d at 435 (โ[A] class action is \n27  formally one suit in which, as a practical matter, a defendant litigates against only the class \n28  representative.โ). \n11 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (SBC) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 274   Filed 11/02/23   PageID.9915   Page 12 of 16\n \n1  As the above opinions indicate, the comparison between a mass action and a class \n2  action is instructive.  In a mass action like that involved in Bristol-Myers, all plaintiffs are \n3  named parties in the case, and the defendant must defend against each plaintiff and their \n4  individualized claims.  Lyngaas, 992 F.3d at 435.  The trial court may be able to resolve \n5  shared legal issues through consolidation but will then move on to individual issues in each \n6  plaintiffโs suit.  Id.  Because โ[t]hese individual issues might โpresent significant variationsโ \n7  such that a defense would require different legal theories or different evidence,โ the burden \n8  on the defendant associated with answering each plaintiffโs claims is high.  See id. (quoting \n9  Sanchez v. Launch Tech. Workforce Sols., LLC, 297 F. Supp. 3d 1360, 1366 (N.D. Ga. \n10  2018)).  \n11  By contrast, the lead plaintiffs in a Rule 23 class action โearn the right to represent \n12  the interests of absent class members by satisfying all four criteria of Rule 23(a) and one \n13  branch of Rule 23(b).โ  Mussat, 953 F.3d at 447.  Under Rule 23(b)(3), for example, named \n14  plaintiffs must satisfy numerosity, commonality, typicality, adequacy of representation, \n15  predomination, and superiority requirements before a class can be certified.  See Fed. R. \n16  Civ. P. 23(b).  These requirements ensure that a defendant โis presented with a unitary, \n17  coherent claim to which it need respond only with a unitary, coherent defense.โ  Lyngaas, \n18  992 F.3d at 435 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Sanchez, 297 F. Supp. 3d \n19  at 1366); see also id. (โIn this sense, the only โsuitโ before the court is the one brought by \n20  the named plaintiff.โ).   \n21  Relative to a mass action, therefore, the burden a defendant bears in litigating a class \n22  action is substantially reduced.  See Drywall Prods., 2017 WL 5971622, at *14 (noting that \n23  โ[o]ften, mass torts cannot qualify for class action treatment because they are unable to \n24  satisfy [the additional due process standards for class certification under Rule 23]โ).  Thus, \n25  when determining whether it may exercise specific personal jurisdiction over Defendant in \n26  the instant class action, this Court โneed analyze only the claims raised by the named \n27  [P]laintiff[s], who in turn represent[] the absent class members.โ  Lyngaas, 992 F.3d at 435. \n28  / / / \n12 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (SBC) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 274   Filed 11/02/23   PageID.9916   Page 13 of 16\n \n1  The Court further notes that analyzing only the claims raised by the named Plaintiffs \n2  serves the โgoals of class action litigation.โ  See Devlin, 536 U.S. at 10.  First, โ[t]he \n3  efficient administration of class actions would be compromised by requiring the Court to \n4  make  personal  jurisdiction  determinations  for  every  named  and  potential  unnamed \n5  plaintiff.โ  Knotts v. Nissan N. Am., Inc., 346 F. Supp. 3d 1310, 1335 (D. Minn. 2018); see \n6  also Al Haj v. Pfizer Inc., 338 F. Supp. 3d 815, 822 (N.D. Ill. 2018).  Second, treating \n7  nonnamed class members as nonparties helps โprevent[] multiple suits.โ  See Devlin, 536 \n8  U.S. at 11.  True, any dismissed out-of-state class members could theoretically file a single, \n9  nationwide action in a State where Defendant is subject to general jurisdiction.  However, \n10  such class members might instead resort to piecemeal, competing actions in their home \n11  states.  See Sloan v. Gen. Motors LLC, 287 F. Supp. 3d 840, 863 & n.7 (N.D. Cal. 2018), \n12  order clarified, No. 16-CV-07244-EMC, 2018 WL 1156607 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 5, 2018), on \n13  reconsideration, 438 F. Supp. 3d 1017 (N.D. Cal. 2020); Bliss v. CoreCivic, Inc., 580 F. \n14  Supp. 3d 924, 928 (D. Nev. 2022).  Treating nonnamed class members as irrelevant for \n15  purposes of the exercise of specific jurisdiction over a defendant mitigates both of these \n16  concerns.   \n17  Defendantโs arguments to the contrary are not persuasive. First, Defendant cites \n18  Moser for the proposition that nonnamed class members become full parties to a case in all \n19  respects after class certification.  See Mem. at 14; Reply at 6โ7.  But Moser held only that \n20  that nonnamed putative class members โwere not yet parties to the case,โ and cited as \n21  persuasive the D.C. Circuitโs opinion in Molock.  8 F.4th at 877โ78.  In that case, the D.C. \n22  Circuit recognized that even โin certified class actions,โ nonnamed class members are \n23  considered nonparties for some purposes.  Molock, 952 F.3d at 297.  For example, in \n24  certified  class  actions,  nonnamed  class  members  are  nonparties  with  respect  to  the \n25  complete diversity requirement of 28 U.S.C. ยง 1332.  See id. (citing Devlin, 536 U.S. at 10).  \n26  Thus, a nonnamed class memberโs party status does not depend on certification alone.  \n27  Second, Defendant asserts that Rule 23โs procedures are โnot intended to benefit the \n28  defendant or protect its right to due process.โ  Reply at 9โ10.  It is far from clear, however, \n13 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (SBC) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 274   Filed 11/02/23   PageID.9917   Page 14 of 16\n \n1  that Rule 23 was designed only to protect absent class members.  See Fischer, 42 F.4th \n2  at 373โ74 (โ[C]ourts and Congress have constructed a careful balance designed to protect \n3  both the absent class members . . . and defendants . . . .โ).  And even if Rule 23 were \n4  designed primarily with nonnamed class members in mind, it does not follow that Rule \n5  23โs procedures do not also benefit defendants.  Tellingly, Defendant neither offers a \n6  persuasive rejoinder to the contention that defendants benefit from the uniformity created \n7  by Rule 23 nor identifies other burdens associated with the claims of nonnamed class \n8  members that might offset Rule 23โs benefits.3  See generally Mem.; Reply.   \n9  Third, Defendant notes that Shutts distinguished defendantsโ due process rights from \n10  those of nonnamed class members.  See Mem. at 14โ15.  But in the passages cited by \n11  Defendant, the Shutts Court discussed the due process interests of โabsent defendants in \n12  nonclass suits.โ  Shutts, 472 U.S. at 811 (emphasis added).  The Courtโs discussion of the \n13  burdens borne by such a defendant, id. at 808, does not bear on the question of whether a \n14  defendant in a class actionโone who is already present and engaged in litigation within a \n15  forumโis so burdened by the addition of nonnamed class membersโ claims that proceeding \n16  with litigation regarding those claims violates the Constitution.  See Lyngaas, 992 F.3d at \n17  437 (noting that neither Bristol-Myers nor Shutts โhave already answered the jurisdictional \n18  question presented in this caseโ).  Instead, the Shutts Courtโs reasoning supports the \n19  conclusion that class actions allow for โdiverging specific personal jurisdiction analyses.โ  \n20  See id. at 435โ36. \n21  / / / \n22 \n \n23 \n3 Defendant makes only the general assertion that โthe burden on CoreCivic to defend a nationwide class \n24 \nin this forum is โasymmetricalโ to [CoreCivicโs] limited operations in California.โ  Mem. at 19 (quoting \n25  Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Brit.-Am. Ins. Co., Ltd., 828 F.2d 1439, 1442 (9th Cir. 1987)).  This statement \ndoes not indicate how, if at all, the presence of nonnamed class members increases Defendantโs litigation \n26  burden.  Cf. Lyngaas, 992 F.3d at 437.  If anything, allowing Plaintiffs to represent nonnamed class \nmembers in California decreases Defendantโs litigation burden by avoiding piecemeal, state-by-state \n27 \nlitigation; duplicative discovery; and the risk of inconsistent liability.  See Sloan, 287 F. Supp. 3d at 863 \n(noting that the burden on the defendant associated with litigating the claims of out-of-state plaintiffs is \n28 \nโde minimis, particularly because the alternative would be for those plaintiffs to file new, separate casesโ). \n14 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (SBC) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 274   Filed 11/02/23   PageID.9918   Page 15 of 16\n \n1  Finally, Defendant argues that it is unfair to bind it to the Courtโs adjudication of \n2  each nonnamed class memberโs claim without conducting a โminimum contactsโ analysis \n3  with respect to each claim.  See Reply at 10.  This argument ignores, however, the type of \n4  unfairness with which due process limits on personal jurisdiction are primarily concerned: \n5  โthe burden on the defendant.โ  Bristol-Myers, 582 U.S. at 263 (internal quotation marks \n6  omitted) (quoting World-Wide Volkswagen, 444 U.S. at 292).  In the class action context, \n7  Rule 23โs strenuous certification procedures ensure that the addition of nonnamed class \n8  membersโ  claims  does  not  render  the  class  representativeโs  chosen  forum  unduly \n9  burdensome,  thereby  protecting  defendantsโ  due  process  rights.    And  if  a  class \n10  representativeโs chosen forum is unfair from the startโe.g., if the burden associated with \n11  traveling to the forum or participating in discovery in the forum is unconstitutionally high, \n12  see Shutts, 472 U.S. at 808โdefendants are not left without a remedy.  They need only \n13  challenge the courtโs exercise of personal jurisdiction over them with respect to the named \n14  representativeโs claim.  See Sousa, 2020 WL 6399595, at *4. \n15  For the reasons stated above, to exercise personal jurisdiction over the claims of the \n16  class  as  a  whole,  the  Court  need  determine  only  whether  it  may  exercise  specific \n17  jurisdiction over the claims of the named class representatives.  Defendant does not dispute \n18  that the Court may exercise specific jurisdiction over the claims of the named class \n19  representatives.  See Mem. at 1โ2.  Therefore, the Court concludes that it may exercise \n20  specific jurisdiction over Defendant with respect to the claims of the class as a whole. \n21  As the Court has resolved the Partiesโ dispute on this ground, the Court declines to \n22  reach the question of whether it may exercise general jurisdiction over Defendant.  See \n23  Mem. at 3โ5; Oppโn at 12โ13.  The Court similarly declines to reach the Partiesโ arguments \n24  regarding whether its status as a federal court allows it to exercise personal jurisdiction \n25  where a state court could not.  See Mem. at 10โ13; Oppโn at 9.  Finally, because the Court \n26  has determined that it need not engage in a specific personal jurisdiction analysis with \n27  respect to the claims of nonnamed class members, Defendantโs arguments regarding the \n28  individual  prongs  of  that  analysisโincluding  Defendantโs  contention  that  it  is \n15 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (SBC) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 274   Filed 11/02/23   PageID.9919   Page 16 of 16\n \n1  unreasonable for this Court to exercise jurisdiction over nonnamed class membersโ claims, \n2  see Mem. at 19โ20โare moot.  \n3  CONCLUSION \n4    In light of the foregoing, the Court DENIES Defendantโs Renewed Motion for \n5  Judgment on the Pleadings (ECF No. 262).  The Court refers the Parties to the chambers \n6  of the magistrate judge  assigned to the case to resolve any outstanding discovery or \n7  scheduling concerns.   \n8    IT IS SO ORDERED. \n9  Dated:  November 2, 2023   \n10     \n \n11 \n \n12 \n \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n16 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (SBC) ",

(โDefendantโ), and therefore are entitled to the protections \n11 afforded employees under the California Labor Code and Industrial Welfare Commission \n12 (โI.W.C.โ) Wage Order No. 5-2001; (2) Defendant violated California Labor Code section \n13 226 when it failed to provide Plaintiffs and the California Labor Law Class with wage \n14 statements as required by that Code section; and (3) Defendant violated California Labor \n15 Code section 1194 when it failed to compensate Plaintiffs and the California Labor Law \n16 Class with a minimum hourly wage as required by that Code section (the โMotionโ). \n17  Plaintiffs bring this Motion individually and on behalf of the putative โCalifornia \n18 Labor Law Class,โ defined in Plaintiffsโ pending Motion For Class Certification as follows: \n19 โAll I.C.E. detainees who (i) were detained at a CoreCivic facility \n20 located in California between May 31, 2013, and the present, and (ii) \n21 worked through CoreCivicโs Volunteer Work Program during their \n22 period of detention in California (the โCA Labor Law Classโ).โ1 \n23 On May 14, 2018, in denying Defendantโs motion to dismiss, this Court held that  \n24 โ. . . at a minimum, Defendant controls the wages, hours and working conditions of \n25 Plaintiffs  and  putative  class  members.    As  such,  Defendant  employed  Plaintiffs  and \n26 putative class members for purposes of California Labor Code ยง 1194.โ  (ECF No. 38 \n27\n                                           \n28 1 Alternatively, should the CA Labor Law Class not be certified such that partial summary \njudgment cannot be granted as to that class of detainee workers, Plaintiffs still proceed with \nthis Motion as to their individual claims. \n  -1-  Case No. 17-CV-01112-JLS-NLS \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 97   Filed 06/05/19   PageID.2865   Page 3 of 5\n \n1 [Order] at 40; see also id. at 37 โ 44 (citing Martinez v. Combs, 49 Cal. 4th 35 (2010)).)  \n2 The undisputed facts establish not only that Plaintiffs and the CA Labor Law Class were \n3 employees of Defendant because Defendant controlled the working environment, hours, \n4 wages, and conditions to which Plaintiffs and the CA Labor Law Class were subject, but \n5 also that Defendant admittedly failed to comply with various provisions of the California \n6 Labor Code regarding the work done by Plaintiffs and the CA Labor Law Class, including \n7 failure to comply with the requirements of section 226 (wage statements) and section 1194 \n8 (minimum wage), as well as related provisions in I.W.C.

Also before the Court is Plaintiffs Sylvester Owino \n21  and Jonathan Gomezโs Response in Opposition to the Motion, (โOppโn,โ ECF No. 22), and \n22  Defendantโs Reply in Support of, (โReply,โ ECF No. 26), the Motion.  The Court vacated \n23  the hearing on the Motion and took it under submission pursuant to Civil Local Rule \n24  7.1(d)(1).  (ECF No. 25.)  After the Court vacated the hearing, Plaintiffs filed two Requests \n25  for Judicial Notice, (โFirst RJN,โ ECF No. 27; โSecond RJN,โ ECF No. 32), to which \n26  Defendant filed a Response, (โRJN Response,โ ECF No. 36).  Then, the Court stayed the \n27  current proceedings and deferred ruling on Defendantโs Motion, (ECF No. 33), for the \n28  purpose  of  addressing  a  motion  to  consolidate  in  a  related  case,  Gonzalez  et  al.  v. \n1 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.352   Page 2 of 51\n \n1  CoreCivic, Inc., (No. 17-CV-2573 JLS (NLS)).  The Court ruled on the related matter and \n2  now LIFTS the stay in these proceedings.  After considering the Partiesโ arguments and \n3  the law, the Court rules as follows. \n4  BACKGROUND \n5    Plaintiffs are former civil immigration detainees who were incarcerated at the Otay \n6  Mesa Detention Center, which is owned and operated by Defendant.  (โCompl.,โ ECF No. \n7  1, ยถยถ 10โ11.)  Plaintiffs allege while at Otay Mesa, they and other detainees performed a \n8  variety of tasks for Defendant ranging from โscrubb[ing] bathrooms, showers, toilets, and \n9  windowsโ to โprovid[ing] barber services to detaineesโ to โperform[ing] clerical work for \n10  CoreCivic.โ  (Id. ยถ 14.)  In return for those services, detainees were paid $1.00 per day, \n11  which Plaintiffs refer to as โDollar-A-Day Work.โ  (Id. ยถ 15.)  Detainees could only spend \n12  their earnings at Defendantโs โcompany storeโ or commissary.  (Id.)   \n13  Plaintiffs also allege that Defendant forced Plaintiffs and other detainees โto clean, \n14  maintain, scrub, sweep, and mop floors, bathrooms, showers, toilets, and windows for no \n15  pay at all.โ  (Id. ยถ 16.)  Defendant allegedly threatened to punish Plaintiffs and other \n16  detainees who refused to work by means of โconfinement, physical restraint, substantial \n17  and  sustained  restriction,  deprivation,  and  violation  of  their  liberty,  and  solitary \n18  confinement.โ  (Id.)  \n19  Plaintiffs seek to certify three subclasses.  Two of those subclasses would include \n20  all detainees who performed uncompensated work for Defendant, both nationallyโthe \n21  โNationwide  Forced  Labor  Classโโand  in  Californiaโthe  โCalifornia  Forced  Labor \n22  Class.โ  (Id. ยถ 30.)  The third subclass would include all detainees who performed work for \n23  Defendant and were paid one dollar per dayโthe โCalifornia Labor Law Class.โ  (Id.)  \n24  Plaintiffs bring twelve claims, which can be divided as follows.  First, Plaintiffs allege \n25  violations of the federal Trafficking Victims Protection Act (โTVPAโ), 18 U.S.C. ยง 1589, \n26  et seq., and the California Trafficking Victims Protection Act, Cal. Civ. Code ยง 52.5.  (See \n27  Compl. ยถยถ 40โ62.)  Next, Plaintiffs allege violations of numerous sections of the California \n28  Labor Code.  (See id. ยถยถ 71โ101.)  Finally, Plaintiffs bring a negligence claim, (id. ยถยถ 102โ\n2 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.353   Page 3 of 51\n \n1  19), a claim for violation of Californiaโs Unfair Competition Law (โUCLโ), Cal. Bus. & \n2  Prof. Code ยง 17200 et seq., and an unjust enrichment claim, (id. ยถยถ 120โ28). \n3  LEGAL STANDARD \n4  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) permits a party to raise by motion the \n5  defense that the complaint โfail[s] to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,โ \n6  generally referred to as a motion to dismiss.  The Court evaluates whether a complaint \n7  states a cognizable legal theory and sufficient facts in light of Federal Rule of Civil \n8  Procedure 8(a), which requires a โshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the \n9  pleader  is  entitled  to  relief.โ    Although  Rule  8  โdoes  not  require  โdetailed  factual \n10  allegations,โ . . . it [does] demand more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-\n11  harmed-me accusation.โ  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. \n12  Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)).  In other words, โa plaintiffโs obligation to \n13  provide  the  โgroundsโ  of  his  โentitle[ment]  to  reliefโ  requires  more  than  labels  and \n14  conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.โ  \n15  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (citing Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 286 (1986)).  A \n16  complaint will not suffice โif it tenders โnaked assertion[s]โ devoid of โfurther factual \n17  enhancement.โโ  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 677 (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557). \n18  In order to survive a motion to dismiss, โa complaint must contain sufficient factual \n19  matter, accepted as true, to โstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.โโ  Id. (quoting \n20  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  A claim is facially plausible \n21  when the facts pled โallow the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is \n22  liable for the misconduct alleged.โ  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 677 (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at \n23  556).  That is not to say that the claim must be probable, but there must be โmore than a \n24  sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.โ  Id.  Facts โโmerely consistent \n25  withโ a defendantโs liabilityโ fall short of a plausible entitlement to relief.  Id.  (quoting \n26  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557).  Further, the Court need not accept as true โlegal conclusionsโ \n27  contained in the complaint.  Id.  This review requires context-specific analysis involving \n28  the  Courtโs  โjudicial  experience  and  common  sense.โ    Id.  at  678  (citation  omitted).  \n3 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.354   Page 4 of 51\n \n1  โ[W]here the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere \n2  possibility of misconduct, the complaint has allegedโbut it has not โshow[n]โโโthat the \n3  pleader is entitled to relief.โโ  Id. \n4  ANALYSIS \n5  The Courtโs analysis proceeds as follows.  First, the Court briefly analyzes the \n6  judicial notice requests.  Second, the Court discusses Plaintiffsโ forced labor claims arising \n7  from alleged violations of the federal and California TVPA.  These claims coincide with \n8  Plaintiffsโ putative state and nationwide forced labor classes.  Third, the Court addresses \n9  Plaintiffsโ โDollar-A-Dayโ claims arising from alleged violations of the California Labor \n10  Code.  These claims coincide with Plaintiffsโ putative California labor law class.  Fourth, \n11  the Court analyzes Plaintiffsโ derivative claims. \n12  I.  Request for Judicial Notice \n13  Plaintiffs request the Court judicially notice two documents.  First, Plaintiffs submit \n14  an opinion from Chao Chen v. Geo Group, Inc., No. 17-cv-5769-RJB, 2017 WL 6034365 \n15  (W.D. Wash. Dec. 6, 2017).  (First RJN.)  Second, Plaintiffs request the Court notice the \n16  Tenth Circuitโs opinion in Menocal v. GEO Group, Inc., 882 F.3d 905 (10th Cir. 2018).  \n17  (Second RJN.) \n18  Defendant opposes both Plaintiffsโ requests because โit is inappropriate to request \n19  that the Court take judicial notice of legal authority.โ  (RJN Response 21 (quoting Stiller v. \n20  Costco Wholesale Corp., No. 09-cv-2473-GPC-BGS, 2013 WL 4401371, at *1 (S.D. Cal. \n21  Aug. 15, 2013)).)  The Court agrees with Defendant.  It is well established that that courts \n22  may consider legal reasoning and conclusions of other federal courts without resort to Rule \n23  201.  See, e.g., Derum v. Saks & Co., 95 F. Supp. 3d 1221, 1224 (S.D. Cal. 2015) (citing \n24  McVey v. McVey, 26 F. Supp. 3d 980, 984โ85 (C.D. Cal. 2014)).  The opinions attached to \n25  Plaintiffsโ requests are the legal reasoning and conclusion of other federal courts.  While \n26  the Court will consider relevant legal authority in arriving at its conclusion, the Court \n27 \n                                                                 \n28 \n1 Pin citations refer to the CM/ECF page numbers electronically stamped at the top of each page. \n4 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.355   Page 5 of 51\n \n1  DENIES Plaintiffsโ Requests for Judicial Notice, (ECF Nos. 27, 32). \n2  II.  Forced Labor Claims  \n3  A. Federal TVPA (First Cause of Action) \n4  Plaintiffs allege Defendant violated the Federal Trafficking Victims Protection Act, \n5  18 U.S.C. ยง 1589(a).2  (Compl. ยถ 41.)  Section 1595 creates a private cause of action for \n6  victims of a violation of the TVPA.  18 U.S.C. ยง 1595(a).  Plaintiffs allege they and putative \n7  class members were forced to perform labor and services under force, threats, abuse, and \n8  other means.  (Compl. ยถ 42.)   \n9  Defendant raises several challenges to the TVPA claim.  First, Defendant argues that \n10  the TVPA does not extend to civil immigration detainees performing routine housekeeping \n11  tasks in lawful detention.  (MTD 13.)  Second, Defendant contends that Plaintiffs fail to \n12  plead sufficient facts to state a TVPA claim.  (Id. at 18.)  Third, Defendant argues that \n13  Congress amended the TVPA in 2008; therefore, at least some of Plaintiffsโ claims are \n14  barred because the relevant portions of TVPA cannot be given retroactive effect.  (Id. at \n15  20.)  Fourth, Defendant argues that a portion of Plaintiffsโ claim are barred by the statute \n16  of limitations.  (Id.)  The Court addresses each argument in turn. \n17  1.  Whether the TVPA Extends to Civil Immigration Detainees \n18  Defendant  advances  two  arguments  why  the  TVPA  does  not  apply  to  civil \n19  immigration  detainees.    First,  Congress  did  not  intend  for  the  statute  to  apply  to \n20 \n                                                                 \n21 \n2 18 U.S.C. ยง 1589(a) provides:  \n22  (a) Whoever knowingly provides or obtains the labor or services of a person \nby any one of, or by any combination of, the following meansโ  \n23 \n(1) by means of force, threats of force, physical restraint, or threats of \nphysical restraint to that person or another person;  \n24 \n(2) by means of serious harm or threats of serious harm to that person or \n25  another person;  \n(3) by means of the abuse or threatened abuse of law or legal process; or  \n26  (4) by means of any scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause the person \nto believe that, if that person did not perform such labor or services, that \n27 \nperson or another person would suffer serious harm or physical restraint, \nshall be punished as provided under subsection (d). \n28 \n \n5 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.356   Page 6 of 51\n \n1  Defendantโs conduct.  Second, the Thirteenth Amendment, which provides Congressโs \n2  authority  to  create  the  TVPA,  has  a  โcivic  duty  exceptionโ that  Defendant  contends \n3  exempts its conduct from the TVPA. \n4  a.  Statutory Interpretation of 18 U.S.C. ยง 1589 \n5  Defendant argues that Congressโs purpose in enacting the TVPA, including section \n6  1589, was to โcombat trafficking in persons.โ  (Id. at 13 (quoting Pub. L. No. 106-386, \n7  ยง 102(a), 114 Stat. 1464, 1466 (2000)).)  The congressional findings all focused on the \n8  evils of trafficking in persons.  (Id.)  For example, Congress found: \n9  As the 21st century begins, the degrading institution of slavery \ncontinues throughout the world.   Trafficking in persons is a \n10 \nmodern form of slavery, and it is the largest manifestation of \n11  slavery  today.    At  least  700,000  persons  annually,  primarily \nwomen and children, are trafficked within or across international \n12 \nborders.    Approximately  50,000  women  and  children  are \n13  trafficked into the United States each year. \n14  (Id. at 14 (emphasis omitted) (quoting ยง 102(b)(1), 114 Stat. at 1466).)  Defendant goes on \n15  to cite several similar congressional findingsโall focused on โ[t]rafficking in persons.โ  \n16  (Id.)    From  these  findings  Defendant  concludes  that  Congressโs  clear  intent  was  to \n17  prosecute  human  traffickers,  i.e.,  those  who  transport  persons  โacross  international \n18  bordersโ and force them to work.  (Id. at 15.)  Because neither the U.S. Immigrations and \n19  Customs Enforcement (โICEโ) nor Defendant transported Plaintiffs from their homes or \n20  across national borders, then Defendant is beyond Congressโs intended purpose.  (Id.)  \n21  Finally, Defendant cites several cases for the proposition that where literal application of a \n22  criminal statute would lead to โextreme or absurd resultsโ then the class of persons subject \n23  to the criminal statute should be limited.  (Id. (citing, e.g., United States v. Katz, 271 U.S. \n24  354, 362 (1926)).)  From that rule, Defendant contends that applying a forced labor statute \n25  to lawfully-detained civil immigration detainees would be both extreme and absurd. \n26  Plaintiffs respond that the plain text of the TVPA, including section 1589, proscribes \n27  any kind of forced labor even if that labor does not rise to the level of involuntary servitude \n28  as defined prior to enactment of the TVPA.  (Oppโn 16 (citing NunagโTanedo v. E. Baton \n6 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.357   Page 7 of 51\n \n1  Rouge Parish Sch. Bd., 790 F. Supp. 2d 1134, 1144โ46 (C.D. Cal. 2011); and Menocal v. \n2  GEO Grp., Inc., 113 F. Supp. 3d 1125 (D. Colo. 2015)).)  According to Plaintiffs, the plain \n3  meaning of the TVPA is broad enough to encompass their claims.  Plaintiffs also argue that \n4  the Complaint does not allege any โtraffickingโ violations under the TVPA, but rather bring \n5  violations of the โforced laborโ provision of TVPA, ยง 1589.  (Id. at 19.)   \n6  In reply, Defendant again reiterates its argument that a court must look beyond the \n7  plain language of a statute if a literal application would lead to โextreme of absurd results,โ \n8  (Reply 6โ7 (quoting Katz, 271 U.S. at 362)), or if โinternal evidence of the statuteโ suggests \n9  a โdeparture from a literal readingโ to โeffect the legislative purpose,โ (id. at 7 (quoting \n10  Wilshire Westwood Assocs. v. Atl. Richfield Corp., 881 F.2d 801, 803โ04 (9th Cir. 1989))).  \n11  Defendant also argues Nunag-Tanedo is factually distinguishable.  (See id.) \n12  Defendant argues its conduct does not fall under ยง 1589.  This requires the Court to \n13  undertake statutory construction.  โThe plain language of a statute is the starting point for \n14  its interpretation.โ  Wilshire Westwood Assocs., 881 F.2d at 803 (citing Am. Tobacco Co. \n15  v. Patterson, 456 U.S. 63, 68 (1982)).  A courtโs โfirst step in interpreting a statute is to \n16  determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard \n17  to the particular dispute in the case.  Our inquiry must cease if the statutory language is \n18  unambiguous and โthe statutory scheme is coherent and consistent.โโ  Robinson v. Shell Oil \n19  Co., 519 U.S. 337, 340 (1997) (quoting United States v. Ron Pair Enters., Inc., 489 U.S. \n20  235, 240 (1989)).  โThe plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is determined by \n21  reference to the language itself, the specific context in which that language is used, and the \n22  broader context of the statute as a whole.โ  Id. (citing Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling \n23  Co., 505 U.S. 469, 477 (1992); and McCarthy v. Bronson, 500 U.S. 136, 139 (1991)). \n24  18 U.S.C. ยง 1589 provides:  \n25  (a) Whoever knowingly provides or obtains the labor or \nservices of a person by any one of, or by any combination of, the \n26 \nfollowing meansโ  \n27  (1) by means of force, threats of force, physical restraint, \nor threats of physical restraint to that person or another person;  \n28 \n7 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.358   Page 8 of 51\n \n1  (2) by means of serious harm or threats of serious harm to \nthat person or another person;  \n2 \n(3) by means of the abuse or threatened abuse of law or \n3  legal process; or  \n(4) by means of any scheme, plan, or pattern intended to \n4 \ncause the person to believe that, if that person did not perform \n5  such labor or services, that person or another person would suffer \nserious harm or physical restraint, shall be punished as provided \n6 \nunder subsection (d). \n7   \n8  The statuteโs express terms do not limit who constitutes a victim of forced labor.  Section \n9  1589 applies to any โpersonโโthere is no limitation on the type or status of said person.  \n10  Similarly,  the  target  of  the  statute  is  broad:  section  1589  criminalizes  โ[w]hoever \n11  knowingly provides or obtains the labor or services.โ  Nor does the statute contain any \n12  language limiting application to those who traffic in persons or transport persons across \n13  national borders.   \n14  Had Congress intended to limit ยง 1589 to trafficking or transnational crime it could \n15  have done so; indeed, other sections of the TVPA contain the limiting language Defendant \n16  urges the Court read into ยง 1589.  For example, section 1591 prohibits โ[s]ex trafficking of \n17  children or by force, fraud, or coercionโ and has an explicit interstate or foreign commerce \n18  requirement.  18 U.S.C. ยง 1591 (emphasis added).  Section 1584 criminalizes โ[w]hoever \n19  knowingly and willfully holds to involuntary servitude . . . any other person for any term, \n20  or brings within the United States any person so held.โ  18 U.S.C. ยง 1584(a) (emphasis \n21  added).  The lack of similar language in section 1589 reinforces the conclusion that there \n22  is no limitation on who constitutes a โpersonโ for purposes of section 1589. \n23    Defendant urges the Court to read Congressโs purpose, purportedly evident from \n24  TVPAโs congressional findings, into the statute.  (See MTD 13โ15.)  Yet, courts โhave \n25  long held that there is a strong presumption that the plain language of [a] statute expresses \n26  congressional intent, rebutted only in rare and exceptional circumstances, when a contrary \n27  legislative intent is clearly expressed.โ  Campbell v. Allied Van Lines Inc., 410 F.3d 618, \n28  622 (9th Cir. 2005) (alteration in original) (quoting United States v. Tobeler, 311 F.3d \n8 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.359   Page 9 of 51\n \n1  1201, 1203 (9th Cir. 2002)).  โThe preeminent canon of statutory interpretation requires us \n2  to โpresume that [the] legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what \n3  it says there.โโ  BedRoc Ltd., LLC v. United States, 541 U.S. 176, 183 (2004) (alteration in \n4  original) (quoting Conn. Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U.S. 249, 253โ54 (1992)).  If the \n5  statutory text is unambiguous, the inquiry ends there.  See id.   \n6  Here,  Defendantโs  arguments  do  not  illustrate  ambiguity  in  the  language  or \n7  exceptional circumstances to depart from the plain language of the statute.  The Sixth \n8  Circuit addressed an argument similar to Defendantโs in United States v. Callahan, 801 \n9  F.3d 606 (6th Cir. 2015).  There, two defendants were convicted for violating section 1589 \n10  when they forced a developmentally-disabled young woman and her minor daughter โto \n11  clean the apartment, do yardwork, care for [the defendantsโ] dogs, and run various errands \n12  for [the defendants].โ  Id. at 613.  The court went on to detail more than two years of \n13  inhumane  conductโnone  of  which  involved  transporting  people  across  borders  or \n14  trafficking in persons.  See id. at 613โ16.  The defendants were convicted at trial and \n15  appealed.   \n16  Like Defendant here, the Callahan defendants argued that the TVPAโs legislative \n17  history was passed to combat international trafficking in human beings and Congress did \n18  not intend to criminalize their conduct.  Id. at 617.  The Callahan court reasoned that the \n19  plain language of the statute was not limited to immigrant victims or sex workers.  The \n20  court  determined  that  reference  to  legislative  history  was  unnecessary  when  the \n21  legislatureโs intent was obvious from the statuteโs unambiguous language.  Id. at 617โ18 \n22  (citations omitted).  The court was also unpersuaded by an argument that ยง 1589 was meant \n23  to target those who exploit foreign-born victims because, again, the language of the statue \n24  did not include such a restriction.  Id. at 618.  Accordingly, the court held that ยง 1589 \n25  proscribed the defendantsโ conduct.  Id. at 620. \n26  The Court finds the Callahan courtโs reasoning and conclusion persuasive.  There is \n27  no ambiguity in section 1589 and the Court will not read congressional findings into the \n28  statute.  The next issue is whether the Court should deviate from the plain meaning of the \n9 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.360   Page 10 of 51\n \n1  statute when literal application of the criminal statute would lead to โextreme or absurd \n2  results.โ  Katz, 271 U.S. at 362.  Defendant argues that interpreting the phrase โlabor or \n3  services of a personโ to include lawfully-detained civil immigration detainees required to \n4  clean up after themselves is both extreme and absurd.  Defendant does not explain its \n5  reasoning  beyond  its  assertion  that  it  would  be  absurd  to  criminalize  Defendantโs \n6  requirement for lawfully-detained immigration detainees to clean up.3 \n7  Perhaps Defendant thinks it absurd to criminalize its alleged conduct because the \n8  federal government contracts with Defendant to house civil immigration detainees, i.e., \n9  Plaintiffs and other putative class members were lawfully detained.  Yet, this Court and \n10  courts across this nation routinely hear cases involving violations of constitutional rights \n11  of incarcerated prisoners at the state and federal level.  These prisoners were lawfully \n12  imprisoned.  Lawful detention, by itself, is not a shield against illegal conduct against those \n13  held in detention.   \n14  Alternatively, Defendant might argue that the โlabor or servicesโ it requires of \n15  detainees  is  minisculeโdetainees  are  only  required  to  clean  up  their  personal  and \n16  communal areas.  Logically, this is a question of degree.  If detainees are only forced to \n17 \n                                                                 \n18 \n3 Defendantโs concern for an โabsurd and extremeโ application is tempered by two considerations.  First, \n19 \nsection 1589 only reaches labor or service achieved through force, โserious harm,โ abuse of legal process, \nor a scheme intended to cause a person to believe that serious harm would befall that person.  See \n20 \nยง 1589(a)(1)โ(4).  The term โserious harmโ is defined broadly.  See ยง 1589(c)(2).  As the Ninth Circuit \n21  has summarized:  \n[S]omeone is guilty of forced labor if he intends to cause a person in his \n22  employ to believe that if she does not continue to work, she will suffer the \ntype of serious harmโphysical or nonphysical, including psychological, \n23 \nfinancial,  reputation  harmโthat  would  compel  someone  in  her \ncircumstances to continue working to avoid that harm. \n24 \n \n25  United States v. Dann, 652 F.3d 1160, 1169โ70 (9th Cir. 2011).  Second, section 1589โs scope is narrowed \nfurther still by the requirement of scienter.  Id. at 1170 (citing United States v. Calimlim, 538 F.3d 706, \n26  712, 714 (7th Cir. 2008)).  โThe jury must find that the employer intended to cause the victim to believe \nthat she would suffer serious harmโfrom the vantage point of the victimโif she did not continue to \n27 \nwork.โ  Id.  These two limitations mitigate, at a high level of generality, the concern against โabsurd or \nextremeโ application of this criminal statute.  \n28 \n \n10 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.361   Page 11 of 51\n \n1  make their beds then such conduct likely does not rise to criminal forced labor.  Indeed, \n2  ICE has published standards requiring civil immigration detainees to make their beds, \n3  amongst  other  personal  housekeeping  tasks.    See  U.S.  Immigration  &  Customs \n4  Enforcement, Performance-Based National Detention Standards 2011, ยง 5.8, at 406 (2016 \n5  ed.),  https://www.ice.gov/doclib/detention-standards/2011/5-8.pdf  (hereinafter  โICE \n6  PBNDSโ).4  Conversely, one could imagine forced labor to such an extent and degree as to \n7  go well beyond cleaning personal and communal areas.  In fact, Plaintiffs allege that \n8  Defendant forced them to โclean, maintain, scrub, sweep, and mop floors, bathrooms, \n9  showers, toilets, and windows for no pay at all, not only in their living areas (โpodsโ), but \n10  also throughout the other interior and exterior areas of CoreCivicโs detention facilities.โ \n11  (Compl. ยถ 16.)  The preceding comparison illustrates that Plaintiffsโ claims require a fact-\n12  intensive inquiry.   The Court  raises this hypothetical only to illustrate the following \n13  conclusion: the Court only finds that applying ยง 1589 to Defendantโs alleged conduct does \n14  not lead to per se โextreme or absurdโ consequences that would warrant deviation from \n15  ยง 1589โs plain meaning. \n16  b.  Civic Duty Exception \n17  Defendant advances a second argument why the TVPA does not apply to its conduct: \n18  Defendant may avail itself of the Thirteenth Amendmentโs civic duty exception.  (See MTD \n19  15โ18.)  Defendant begins with United States v. Kozminski, 487 U.S. 931 (1988), where \n20  the Supreme Court examined the phrase โinvoluntary servitude,โ found in 18 U.S.C. \n21  ยง 1584.  As Defendant explains, Kozminski determined that Congress intended ยง 1584 to \n22  carry the same meaning as the Thirteenth Amendmentโs prohibition against โinvoluntary \n23  servitude.โ  (Id. at 16 (citing Kozminski, 487 U.S. at 944โ45).)  The Supreme Court also \n24 \n                                                                 \n25 \n4 A court may take judicial notice of publicly available government documents, including those posted on \n26  government web sites.  See Gerritsen v. Warner Bros. Entmโt Inc., 112 F. Supp. 3d 1011, 1033โ34 (C.D. \nCal. 2015) (citing, e.g., DanielsโHall v. Natโl Educ. Assโn, 629 F.3d 992, 999 (9th Cir. 2010); and Hansen \n27 \nBeverage Co. v. Innovation Ventures, LLC, No. 08โCVโ1166โIEG, 2009 WL 6597891, at *1 (S.D. Cal. \nDec. 23, 2009)).  \n28 \n \n11 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.362   Page 12 of 51\n \n1  recognized  a  long-standing  โcivic  dutyโ  exception  to  the  Thirteenth  Amendmentโs \n2  prohibition on involuntary servitude whereby state or federal governments could compel \n3  their citizens, by threat of criminal sanction, to perform certain civic duties.  (Id. (citing \n4  Kozminski, 487 U.S. at 943โ44).)  Thus, Defendant argues that ยง 1589, which Congress \n5  enacted  after  Kozminski,  incorporates  the  civic  duty  exception  and  the  exception  is \n6  available to Defendant.  (Id. at 17 (citing Miles v. Apex Marine Corp., 498 U.S. 19, 32 \n7  (1990); Goodyear Atomic Corp. v. Miller, 486 U.S. 174, 184โ85 (1988)).) \n8  Defendant then cites Channer v. Hall, 112 F.3d 214, 215 (5th Cir. 1997), where the \n9  Fifth Circuit applied the civic duty exception to an immigration detainee.  There, an \n10  immigration  detainee  was  compelled  to  work  in  the  Food  Services  Department  and \n11  โintimidated and threatened with solitary confinement if he failed to work.โ  (MTD 16 \n12  (quoting Channer, 112 F.3d at 218).)  The Channer court held that the detainee was not \n13  subjected to โinvoluntary servitudeโ because the civic duty exception applied and โthe \n14  federal government [was] entitled to require a communal contribution by an INS detainee \n15  in  the  form  of  housekeeping  tasks.โ    (Id.  (quoting  Channer,  112  F.3d  at  218โ19).)  \n16  Defendant urges the Court to adopt the civic duty exception to Plaintiffsโ situation, which \n17  appears to be factually similar to Channer.   \n18  Congress  amended  the  TVPA  post-Kozminski,  but  Defendant  argues  that  the \n19  amendment did not alter the civic duty exceptionโs applicability to TVPA.  (See id. at 17.)  \n20  Defendant cites several decisions from after the TVPA amendment where federal courts \n21  applied the civic duty exception to deny claims brought by immigration detainees.  (Id. at \n22  17โ18 (citing, e.g., Owuor v. Courville, No. 11-CV-926, 2013 WL 7877306, at *4 (W.D. \n23  La. Aug. 7, 2013)).)  Defendant would have the Court find that Channerโs logic controls \n24  and the civic duty exception applies to Defendantโs conduct. \n25  Finally, Defendant cites 28 C.F.R. ยง 545.23, which permits the federal Bureau of \n26  Prisons to require pretrial inmates to perform โhousekeeping tasks in the inmateโs own cell \n27  and in the community living area.โ  (Id. at 18.)  Defendant cites cases from the Fourth, \n28  Seventh, and Eighth Circuits where courts denied claims from pretrial detainees required \n12 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.363   Page 13 of 51\n \n1  to perform โgeneral housekeeping responsibilitiesโ without pay.  (Id. at 16โ17 (quoting \n2  Bijeol v. Nelson, 579 F.2d 423, 424โ25 (7th Cir. 1978) (per curiam); and citing Hause v. \n3  Vaught, 993 F.2d 1079, 1085 4th Cir. 1993); and Martinez v. Turner, 977 F.2d 421, 423 \n4  (8th Cir. 1992)).)  Defendant argues that construing 18 U.S.C. ยง 1589 to criminalize \n5  housekeeping  tasks required by  Defendant  would  also  criminalize  the same  types of \n6  housekeeping tasks required of pretrial detainees and authorized by federal regulation.  \n7  (Id.) \n8  Plaintiffs respond that there is no civic duty exception for section 1589.  (Oppโn 19.)  \n9  Plaintiffs  argue  that  Defendant  has  not  cited  any  authority  for  reading  a  civic  duty \n10  exception into the TVPA or applying the exception to a private, for-profit venture.  (Id.)  \n11  Plaintiffs distinguish Defendantโs cited cases as all involving Bivens claims for violation \n12  of the Thirteenth Amendment in federal government-run detention facilities.  (Id.) \n13  The Court begins with the basic proposition that the Thirteenth Amendment does \n14  not prohibit compelled labor in all situations.  There are generally three exceptions to \n15  involuntary servitude.  First, by its own terms, the Amendment  excludes involuntary \n16  servitude imposed as legal punishment for a crime.  See U.S. Const. amend. XIII.  Second, \n17  the Supreme Court has recognized that the prohibition against involuntary servitude โdoes \n18  not prevent the State or Federal Governments from compelling their citizens, by threat of \n19  criminal sanction, to perform certain civic duties.โ  Kozminski, 487 U.S. at 943โ44.  Third, \n20  the  Thirteenth  Amendment  does  not  apply  to  โexceptionalโ  cases  that  were  well-\n21  established in the common law when the Amendment was passed.  See id. at 944 (citing \n22  Robertson v. Baldwin, 165 U.S. 275, 282, 288 (1897)) (explaining the Amendment does \n23  not reach the right of parents to custody of minor children or laws preventing sailors from \n24  deserting their ships).  Defendant only raises the civic duty exception; thus, the Courtโs \n25  first task is to determine whether the exception applies to the TVPA in its entirety or only \n26  where TVPA refers to โinvoluntary servitude.โ  The issue before the Kozminski court was \n27  the interpretation of the term โinvoluntary servitude,โ found in 18 U.S.C. ยง 1584, which \n28  the Supreme Court determined to be co-extensive with the scope of the โinvoluntary \n13 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.364   Page 14 of 51\n \n1  servitudeโ found in the Thirteenth Amendment.  Kozminski, 487 U.S. at 948.  Section 1589 \n2  does not contain the term โinvoluntary servitudeโ and it is conceivable that the civic duty \n3  exception might not apply to section 1589.  Indeed, Plaintiffs contend that there is no \n4  authority to read a civic duty exception into the TVPA.  (Oppโn 19.) \n5  Congress has broad power to determine โwhat are the badges and the incidents of \n6  slavery, and the authority to translate that determination into effective legislation.โ  Griffin \n7  v. Breckenridge, 403 U.S. 88, 105 (1971) (quoting Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U.S.  \n8  409, 440 (1968)).  Congress enacted the TVPA pursuant to its power to enforce  the \n9  Thirteenth Amendment.  See Kozminski, 487 U.S. at 934.  Defendant has not cited any \n10  explicit authority applying the civic duty exception to 18 U.S.C. ยง 1589.  The Sixth Circuit \n11  has examined whether the โexceptionalโ case exception to the Thirteenth Amendment \n12  applied to ยง 1589.  See United States v. Toviave, 761 F.3d 623, 626 (6th Cir. 2014).  There, \n13  the federal government attempted to prosecute parents for child abuse under section 1589.  \n14  Id. at 623โ24.  The Sixth Circuit reasoned that the Thirteenth Amendmentโs exceptional \n15  case exception applied to a parentโs control over a childโs work and concluded that section \n16  1589 could not criminalize a parentโs control over a child.  Id. at 626 (quoting Kozminski, \n17  487 U.S. at 944).  If the Toviave court applied the exceptional case exception to section \n18  1589 then it is logical to apply the civic duty exception to section 1589.  The Court reads \n19  the civic duty exception as deriving from the Thirteenth Amendment, regardless of whether \n20  Congress uses the phrase โinvoluntary servitude.โ  Thus, the Court accepts Defendantโs \n21  premise that the civic duty exception applies to section 1589. \n22  Even so, Plaintiffs raise an important issue bound up in the civic duty analysis: may \n23  a private entity avail itself of the civic duty exception to alleged involuntary servitude.  (See \n24  Oppโn 19.)  Indeed, Kozminski summarized the civic duty exception as permitting โthe \n25  State  or  Federal  Governments  from  compelling  their  citizens,  by  threat  of  criminal \n26 \n27 \n28 \n14 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.365   Page 15 of 51\n \n1  sanction, to perform certain civic duties.โ5  487 U.S. at 943โ44 (emphasis added).  Here, \n2  Defendant is not the government; it is a private, for-profit corporation.  In Menocal v. GEO \n3  Group, Inc., 113 F. Supp. 3d at 1128, the district court encountered a nearly identical \n4  factual scenario and putative class action as the case presently before this Court.  There, \n5  the plaintiffs were current and former civil immigration detainees held at a private, for-\n6  profit immigration detention facility.  Like here, the plaintiffs also alleged that they were \n7  forced  to  clean  the facilityโs  pods  without  compensation  under  the threat of solitary \n8  confinement.  Id.  The plaintiffs brought claims under 18 U.S.C. ยง 1589 and, like here, the \n9  defendants argued that the civic duty exception applied to bar the plaintiffsโ claims.  See \n10  id. at 1132.  The Menocal court found that โDefendants have cited no authority for reading \n11  a civic duty exception into ยง 1589, or for applying such an exception to a private, for-profit \n12  corporation under contract with the government.โ  Id. at 1133. \n13  Defendant argues that the Menocal courtโs holding is flawed and urges this Court to \n14  apply the civic duty exception because Defendant is a โfederal actor.โ  (Reply 9โ10.)  \n15  Defendant cites several cases in support of its proposition.6  In Doe v. United States, 831 \n16 \n                                                                 \n17 \n5 Defendantโs cited authority all involve incidents of purported involuntary servitude at government-run \n18  facilities.  See Channer, 112 F.3d at 215 (stating that the plaintiff was incarcerated at the Federal \nCorrectional Institution at Oakdale, Louisiana); see also Mendez v. Haugen, No. CV 14-4792 ADM/BRT, \n19 \n2015 WL 5718967, at *1 (D. Minn. Sept. 29, 2015), affโd (8th Cir. Feb. 22, 2016) (plaintiff housed in \nFederal Medical Center in Rochester, Minnesota); Owour v. Courville, No. 11-cv-926, 2013 WL 7877306, \n20 \nat *1 (W.D. La.

Nov. 7, 2008) \n(plaintiff housed in the Federal Correctional Complex in Yazoo City, Mississippi). \n22  6 Doe v. United States is the representative of Defendantโs other cited precedent.  Corrections Corporation \nof America, which was CoreCivicโs former corporate name, has routinely been deemed a โstate actorโ for \n23 \npurposes of civil rights complaints.  In Johnson v. Corrections Corp. of America, No. 14cv41 LAB \n(WVG), 2014 WL 2919300, at *2โ3 (S.D. Cal. June 26, 2014), the district court construed a pro se \n24 \nplaintiffโs claim against CCA as a Bivens claim and dismissed the claim because it did not allege violations \n25  by an individual.  Guzman-Martinez v. Corrections Corp. of America, No. CV-11-2390-PHX-NVW, 2012 \nWL 5907081, at *9โ11 (D. Ariz. Nov. 26, 2012), arrived at the same conclusion as Doe; the court \n26  determined CCA to be acting under color of state law.  Murray v. Corr. Corp. of America, No. CV 11-\n2210-PHX-RCB, 2012 WL 2798759, at *1 (D. Ariz. July 9, 2012), likewise determined that CCA was a \n27 \nstate actor.  See Chuwang v. Corr. Corp. of Am., No. CIV.A. L-86-55, 1987 WL 13814, at *1 (S.D. Tex. \nMay 29, 1987) (concluding CCA was federal actor); see also United States v. Thomas, 240 F.3d 445, 448 \n28 \n(5th Cir. 2001) (determining guard at CCA was a โpublic officialโ). \n15 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.366   Page 16 of 51\n \n1  F.3d 309, 314 (5th Cir. 2016), the Fifth Circuit was confronted with a 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \n2  claim against the Corrections Corporation of America (โCCAโ), which was Defendant \n3  CoreCivicโs  corporate  predecessor.    Section  1983  only  reaches  conduct  of  persons \n4  operating under color of law, but the court applied a โpublic functionโ test to determine \n5  whether a private contractorโs actions were โfairly attributable to the State.โ  Id. at 314 \n6  (quoting Cornish v. Corr. Servs. Corp., 402 F.3d 545, 550 (5th Cir. 2005)).  The public \n7  function test required the court to determine the โspecific conduct of which the plaintiff \n8  complains.โ  Id. at 316 (citing Cornish, 402 F.3d at 550)).  The specific conduct at issue in \n9  Doe was โdetaining aliens pending a determination of their immigration status pursuant to \n10  ICE specifications.โ  Id.  The court held that this conduct was a federal function and that \n11  CCA was exempt from ยง 1983 because it were performing a federal function.  Id. \n12  Doe v. United States is exemplary of cases determining whether private conduct is \n13  deemed to be fairly attributable to the State and, thus, state action.  The Supreme Court has \n14  repeatedly held that private actors can be held liable for violations of individual federal \n15  rights if the private actions โcaus[e] the deprivation of a federal right . . . fairly attributable \n16  to the State.โ  Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922, 936 (1982).  โAs a matter of \n17  substantive constitutional law the state-action requirement reflects judicial recognition of \n18  the  fact  that  โmost  rights  secured  by  the  Constitution  are  protected  only  against \n19  infringement by governments.โโ  Id. (quoting Flagg Bros., Inc. v. Brooks, 436 U.S. 149, \n20  156 (1978)).  Thus, the state action requirement, which Defendant relies on, derives from \n21  the Constitutionโs guarantee, applied through the Fourteenth Amendment, that a personโs \n22  civil rights will not be impaired by the state.  See Jackson v. Metro. Edison Co., 419 U.S. \n23  345, 349 (1974) (โIn 1883, this Court in the Civil Rights Cases, 109 U.S. 3 (1883), affirmed \n24  the essential dichotomy set forth in that Amendment between deprivation by the State, \n25 \n                                                                 \n26 \nAgyeman v. Corrections Corp. of America, 390 F.3d 1101 (9th Cir. 2004), held that a plaintiff \n27 \ncould not sustain a Bivens claim against CCA because the Supreme Court previously held that private \ncorporations were not subject to Bivens claims.  Id. at 1103 (citing Corr. Sevs. Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U.S. \n28 \n61 (2001)).   \n16 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.367   Page 17 of 51\n \n1  subject to scrutiny under its provisions, and private conduct, โhowever discriminatory or \n2  wrongful,โ against which the Fourteenth Amendment offers no shield.โ (citing Shelley v. \n3  Kraemer, 335 U.S. 1 (1948))).   \n4  The Court distinguishes the Fourteenth Amendmentโs guarantee of individual civil \n5  rights against state action from the federal and state governmentsโ power to criminalize \n6  conduct.  The Fourteenth and Fifth Amendments restrict government action.  See U.S. \n7  Const. amend. V (โNo person shall be . . . deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due \n8  process of law . . . .:), amend. XIV (โNo state shall make or enforce any law which shall \n9  abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state \n10  deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any \n11  person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.โ).  Conversely, Article I, \n12  section 8 of the U.S. Constitution and State constitutions give rise to affirmative powers. \n13  The Constitution creates a federal government of enumerated powers.  See U.S. \n14  Const. art. I, ยง 8; United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 552 (1995).  The Necessary and \n15  Proper Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, ยง 8, cl. 18, grants Congress broad power to enact federal \n16  legislation, United States v. Comstock, 560 U.S. 126, 133 (2010) (citing McCulloch v. \n17  Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 405 (1819)).  Thus, even though the Constitution does not \n18  explicitly authorize federal crimes, the Necessary and Proper Clause allows Congress to \n19  criminalize conduct in furtherance of its enumerated powers.  See Comstock, 560 U.S. at \n20  136.  Moreover, the Clause permits Congress to establish a prison system and ensure that \n21  systemโs  โsafe  and  responsible  administration.โ    Id.  at  136โ37.    Likewise,  the  state \n22  governments, as part of their general police powers, routinely criminalize conduct.  See \n23  Torres v. Lynch, 136 S. Ct. 1619, 1625 (2016) (โState legislatures, exercising their plenary \n24  police powers, are not limited to Congressโs enumerated powers; and so States have no \n25  reason to tie their substantive offenses to those grants of authority.โ (citing United States \n26  v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 567 (1995))).  Thus, both state and federal governments derive \n27  their power to criminalize conduct from specific grants of authority. \n28 \n17 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.368   Page 18 of 51\n \n1  The  remaining  question  is  whether  the  civic  duty  exception  falls  within  the \n2  restrictions placed on governments by the Fourteenth and Fifth Amendments or is a power \n3  granted to the federal or state governments by their respective constitutions.  Kozminski \n4  characterized the civic duty exception as, โthe prohibition against involuntary servitude \n5  does not prevent the State or Federal from compelling their citizens, by threat of criminal \n6  sanction, to perform certain civic duties.โ  See 487 U.S. at 943โ44.  Kozminski cited several \n7  examples where the Supreme Court recognized the governmentโs ability to compel certain \n8  labor with the threat of criminal sanction.  Thus, in Arver v. United States, 245 U.S. 366, \n9  388 (1918), the Supreme Court held a selective military draft law to be constitutional \n10  pursuant to Congressโs power to regulate the national militia, see U.S. Const. art. 1, ยง 8, cl. \n11  15.  Or, in Butler v. Perry, 240 U.S. 328, 332โ33 (1916), the Supreme Court upheld a \n12  Florida law requiring citizens to participate in the building and maintenance of public roads \n13  because  the  states  possessed  the  right  to  require  citizens  to  participate  in  certain \n14  construction at the time the States ratified the Thirteenth Amendment.  Thus, the Thirteenth \n15  Amendmentโs civic duty exception derives from the governmentโs constitutional authority \n16  to criminalize conduct, pursuant to either the federal governmentโs enumerated powers or \n17  the state governmentโs police powers.   \n18  The foregoing principles distill into the following.  First, the state actor inquiry is \n19  necessary  to  determine  whether  a  private  personโs  conduct  can  be  attributed  to  the \n20  government.  See Lugar, 457 U.S. at 936.  When private conduct may be attributed to the \n21  state, then that private conduct must adhere to the constitutional limitations placed on state \n22  action by the Fourteenth Amendment.  See Evans v. Newton, 382 U.S. 296, 299 (1966) \n23  (โConduct that is formally โprivateโ may become so entwined with governmental policies \n24  or so impregnated with a governmental character as to become subject to the constitutional \n25  limitations placed upon state action.โ).  Second, the power to criminalize conduct and the \n26  resulting exceptions to the Thirteenth Amendment are distinct from the limitations placed \n27  on government.  Instead, such power is an affirmative grant of authority from either the \n28  United States or State constitutions.  See U.S. Const. art. I, ยง 8, cl. 1 (โThe Congress shall \n18 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.369   Page 19 of 51\n \n1  have power . . . .โ).  Defendantโs only argument supporting its civic duty theory is that it is \n2  a โfederal actor.โ  The cases supporting Defendantโs argument confirm that CoreCivic \n3  (previously Corrections Corporation of America) has been delegated a public function to \n4  such an extent that its conduct must adhere to constitutional limitations.  It does not follow \n5  that the same finding would also mean Congress or the state legislatures delegated to \n6  Defendant their power to criminalize conduct.  Thus, Defendant cannot lay claim to the \n7  civic duty exceptionโDefendant is a private entity, not a government.   \n8  Finally, Defendant argues that it would not be logical to allow pretrial inmates to \n9  perform housekeeping tasks while criminalizing Defendantโs same conduct under ยง 1589.  \n10  (See MTD 18.)  28 C.F.R. ยง 545.23(b) exempts pretrial inmates committed to the Federal \n11  Bureau of Prisons from forced labor โother than housekeeping tasks in the inmateโs own \n12  cell.โ  The Court agrees with Defendant that criminalizing housekeeping tasks in one \n13  instance (civil immigration detention) and permitting it in another (pretrial detention) \n14  would not be a logical reading of ยง 1589.  ICEโs operations manual, like the Code of \n15  Federal Regulations, also requires Plaintiffs to perform personal housekeeping.  See ICE \n16  PBNDS, at 406.  However, Plaintiffsโ Complaint contains factual allegations, which the \n17  Court must accept as true, that go beyond the personal housekeeping tasks listed in the ICE \n18  manual.  (See Comp. ยถ 16 (cleaning floors, bathrooms, and windows not only in Plaintiffsโ \n19  living  areas  (โpodsโ)  but  also  throughout  the  other  interior  and  exterior  areas  of \n20  CoreCivicโs detention facilities).)   \n21  In sum, the Court finds that no reason proffered by Defendant removes its alleged \n22  conduct from 18 U.S.C. ยง 1589โs plain meaning.   \n23  2.  Whether Plaintiffs Allege Sufficient Facts to State a Claim \n24  Defendant next argues that Plaintiffsโ Complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to \n25  state a claim under TVPA.  Defendant contends that Plaintiffs do not provide any factual \n26  details as to Defendantโs purported force or coercion that compelled Plaintiffs and other \n27  detainees to clean their living and community areas.  (MTD 19.)  Thus, Plaintiffs do not \n28  identify who threatened them, how they were threatened, or when they were threatened.  \n19 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.370   Page 20 of 51\n \n1  (Id. (citing Compl. ยถยถ 13, 16, 27, 29).)  Nor do Plaintiffs connect any purported threat to \n2  any specific demand to work or identify what they were forced to do or when they were \n3  forced to do it.  (Id. (citing Roman v. Tyco Simplex Grinnell, 16-CV-3449-T-33AEP, 2017 \n4  WL 2427251, at *5 (M.D. Fla. June 5, 2017)).) \n5  Plaintiffs argue that they allege sufficient facts to state a claim for relief by alleging \n6  the who, what, when, where, and how of the labor and services the detainees were forced \n7  to provide.  (Oppโn 15 (citing Compl. ยถยถ 10โ11, 13โ16, 27โ29).) \n8  The Court begins its analysis with the statute; Plaintiffs allege Defendant violated \n9  18 U.S.C. ยง 1859(a).  The first clause of the statute applies to โ[w]hoever knowingly \n10  provides or obtains the labor or services of a person.โ  18 U.S.C. ยง 1589(a).  The term \n11  โwhoeverโ is broad and does not limit the potential class of persons that fall under section \n12  1589.  Here, Plaintiffs allege that Defendant owns and operates the Otay Mesa Detention \n13  Center.  (Compl. ยถ 11.)  The term โlabor or servicesโ is not defined by the statute and, \n14  therefore, the Court uses the ordinary meaning.  United States v. Marcus, 628 F.3d 36, 44 \n15  (2d Cir. 2010) (citing Smith v. United States, 508 U.S. 223, 228 (1993); Harris v. Sullivan, \n16  968 F.2d 263, 265 (2d Cir. 1992)).  โWebsterโs Third New International Dictionary (1993) \n17  defines โlaborโ as โexpenditure of physical or mental effort esp. when fatiguing, difficult, \n18  or compulsory;โ and โserviceโ is defined as โthe performance of work commanded or paid \n19  for by another.โโ  Callahan, 801 F.3d at 620.  Plaintiffs allege that they and other detainees \n20  cleaned, maintained, scrubbed, swept, and mopped floors, bathrooms, showers, toilets, and \n21  windows.  (Compl. ยถ 16.)  These activities are clearly within the definition of labor or \n22  service.   The term โpersonโ is not limited by the statute and applies to any persons, i.e. \n23  victims of forced labor, subject to the conditions dictated by the statute.  See Callahan, 801 \n24  F.3d at 617.  Here, Plaintiffs allege that they were civil detainees at the Otay Mesa Facility \n25  and that they were engaged to work by Defendant.  (Compl. ยถ 14.)   \n26  Section 1589(a) then requires the foregoing labor or services to be obtained through \n27  one of four means.  Plaintiffs allege three means used by Defendant: (a) force, threats of \n28  force, physical restraint, and threats of physical restraint; (b) serious harm and threats of \n20 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.371   Page 21 of 51\n \n1  serious harm; and (c) abuse and threatened abuse of law and legal process.  (Id. ยถ 42.)  It is \n2  here that Defendant brings to bear its primary argument: Plaintiffs did not allege the means \n3  with any factual particularity.  Plaintiffsโ Complaint alleges the following:  \n4  Defendant forced and coerced Plaintiffs . . . by threatening to \npunish  not  only  those  who  refused  to  work,  but  also  other \n5 \ndetainees  in  the  pods  with  confinement,  physical  restraint, \n6  substantial and sustained restriction, deprivation, and violation \nof their liberty, and solitary confinement, all with the intent to \n7 \nobtain forced labor or services and as punishment for any refusal \n8  to work causing Plaintiffs severe mental pain and suffering. \n9  (Id. ยถ 16.)  Taking the factual allegations as true, the Complaint reveals that Defendant had \n10  a policy of forcing detainees to perform labor or services and if the detainees refused then \n11  they or other detainees would be placed in solitary confinement. \n12     The remaining question is whether allegations of solitary confinement within a \n13  detention facility are sufficient to state a claim under TVPA.  Plaintiffs argue that solitary \n14  confinement has long been recognized as an additional punishment above and beyond day-\n15  to-day incarceration.  (Oppโn 21 (citing, e.g., In re Medley, 134 U.S. 160 (1890)).)  The \n16  Court  finds  this  authority  persuasive.    It  has  long  been  recognized  that  โsolitary \n17  confinement bears โa further terror and peculiar mark of infamy.โโ  Davis v. Ayala, 135 S. \n18  Ct. 2187, 2209 (2015) (Kennedy, J., concurring) (quoting Medley, 134 U.S. at 170).  At the \n19  very  least,  solitary  confinement  constitutes  serious  harm,  which  Congress  defined  to \n20  include psychological harm.  18 U.S.C. ยง 1589(c)(2).  Here, solitary confinement, or the \n21  threat of solitary confinement, sufficiently alleges the means to achieve forced labor. \n22  The case Defendant cites,  Roman v. Tyco Simplex Grinnell, is distinguishable.  \n23  There, a pro se plaintiff alleged the following: โWhile working for Tyco Simplex Grinnell, \n24  I was harassed, eggs, mucus, Grease or tar thrown on company van.  Placed in unfair and \n25  unsafe work Conditions.  Causing me high blood pressure.  All because an oral Contract \n26  was breached.  I seek 7 million dollars in compensation and punitive damages For the \n27  wrong done to me.โ  Roman, 2017 WL 2427251, at *1.  Based on those limited factual \n28  allegations, the district court dismissed a ยง 1859 claim, asking โThe count does state \n21 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.372   Page 22 of 51\n \n1  Roman was โharassedโ and โthreatenedโ but does not clarify who threatened him, how he \n2  was threatened, and for what purpose.  Was Roman threatened because he refused to work \n3  or because he complained about the alleged breach of oral contract?  Was he threatened \n4  with violence, with being fired, or with something else?โ  Id. at *5.  Here, Plaintiffs allege \n5  a specific punishment (solitary confinement) carried out or threatened to be carried out as \n6  a direct consequence for refusing to perform labor.  The conduct occurred while Plaintiffs \n7  were under the exclusive control of Defendant.  Such allegations are sufficient here. \n8    In sum, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have sufficiently stated a claim for a TVPA \n9  violation. \n10  3.  Whether the 2008 TVPA Amendments Apply Retroactively \n11  Defendant argues that Plaintiffs do not have a private cause of action prior to \n12  Congressโs 2008 TVPA amendments.  (MTD 20.)  Congress amended the TVPA to extend \n13  the civil remedy provision, 18 U.S.C. ยง 1595, to allow victims to recover against โwhoever \n14  knowingly benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value from participation in a \n15  venture which that person knew or should have known has engaged in an act in violation \n16  of [the TVPA].โ  (Id. (quoting Pub. L. No. 110-457, ยง 221, 122 Stat. 5044, 5067 (2008)).)  \n17  Defendant contends that Congress did not give the amendment retroactive effect and, \n18  therefore, any liability under the โfinancial benefitโ prong of ยง 1595 can only attach to \n19  conduct after December 23, 2008โthe effective date of the amendment.  (Id. (citing Griffin \n20  v. Alamo, 14-CV-4065, 2016 WL 7391046, at *3 (W.D. Ark. Dec. 21, 2016)).)  Defendant \n21  concludes that Plaintiffs only bring a TVPA claim under the โfinancial benefitโ prong and \n22  therefore Plaintiffs claims before December 23, 2008 must fail. \n23  Plaintiffs respond that at the time Congress enacted the 2008 amendments their \n24  TVPA claims were unexpired under the four-year statute of limitations.  (Oppโn 24.)  As \n25  part of the 2008 amendments, Congress replaced the four-year limitations period and \n26  enacted a ten-year statute of limitations.  122 Stat. at 5067.  Plaintiffs argue that the \n27  applicable rule should be that unexpired claims at the time of enactment do not give rise to \n28  an impermissible retroactive effect.  (Id. (citing, e.g., Landgaf v. USI Film Products, 511 \n22 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.373   Page 23 of 51\n \n1  U.S. 244 (1994); Stogner v. California, 539 U.S. 607, 611, 631 (2003)).)  According to \n2  Plaintiffs, if their claims were alive under the prior limitations period (four years) then \n3  those claims would remain valid through the newly enacted ten-year statute of limitations.  \n4  (Oppโn 24.)  Plaintiffs also point out that they also bring a claim under 18 U.S.C. ยง 1593 \n5  for mandatory restitution, which has no โfinancial benefitโ requirement.  (Oppโn 23 n.7 \n6  (citing Compl. ยถยถ 1, 12, 18, 44, 50; and subpart d of the Prayer for Relief).) \n7  The Fourth Circuit addressed this issue in Cruz v. Maypa, 773 F.3d 138 (4th Cir. \n8  2014).  There, a plaintiff alleged the defendants violated sections 1589 and 1590 by \n9  knowingly obtaining her labor through โmeans of threats,โ โholding her in a position of \n10  involuntary servitude,โ and โconfiscating her passport.โ  Id. at 143.  At the time the alleged \n11  violations took place, the TVPA had a four-year statute of limitations.  Id. at 143โ44; see \n12  Oluoch v. Orina, 101 F. Supp. 3d 325, 329 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (โWhen first enacted, the \n13  TVPRA did not contain a statute of limitations.  Thus, claims brought under the TVPRA \n14  were subject to the default four-year statute of limitations applying to civil causes of action \n15  created by Congress.โ (citation omitted) (citing 28 U.S.C. ยง 1658)).  Then, Congress \n16  amended the TVPA to provide a ten-year statute of limitations.  The plaintiff argued, as \n17  our Plaintiffs do here, that the ten-year limitations period applied to her TVPA claims.  Id. \n18  at 144.  The Cruz court applied the Landgraf framework to determine whether the amended \n19  ten-year statute of limitations applied retroactively.  Landgraf requires a three-step analysis \n20  to determine retroactive application.  First, a court must determine โwhether Congress has \n21  expressly prescribed the statuteโs proper reach.โ  Cruz, 773 F.3d at 144 (citing Landgraf, \n22  511 U.S. at 280).  If Congress prescribed the reach, the inquiry ends.  Id.  If not, a court \n23  must decide whether the statute would operate retroactively, โi.e., whether it would impair \n24  rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a partyโs liability for past conduct, or \n25  impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.โ  Id. (quoting Landgraf, \n26  511 U.S. at 280).  โFinally, if the statute does have a retroactive effect, it will not apply \n27  โabsent clear congressional intent favoring such a result.โโ  Id. (quoting Landgraf, 511 U.S. \n28  at 280). \n23 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.374   Page 24 of 51\n \n1  The Cruz court first determined that Congress did not expressly indicate the 2008 \n2  TVPAโs proper temporal scope.  Id.  Then, the court reasoned that applying the new ten-\n3  year statute of limitations to unexpired claims would not โattach[] new legal consequences \n4  to events completed before its enactment.โ  Id. at 145 (alteration in original) (quoting \n5  Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 270).  The court explained that, โin the criminal context, there is a \n6  consensus that extending a limitations period before prosecution is time-barred does not \n7  run afoul of the Ex Post Facto Clause of the Constitution.โ  Id. (citing, e.g., United States \n8  v. Jeffries, 405 F.3d 682, 685 (8th Cir. 2005)).  Under this reasoning, the Cruz court held \n9  that applying the ten-year limitations period to claims that were unexpired at the time of its \n10  enactment did not give rise to impermissible retroactive effect under Landgraf.  Id. \n11  Cruz would appear to strongly support Plaintiffsโ argument.  Like Cruz, Plaintiffs \n12  argue the statute of limitations had not run prior to the 2008 amendments; therefore, there \n13  is no new legal consequence for Defendant.  However, the case at bar has a critical \n14  distinction.  Cruz only considered the retroactive application of the TVPA statute of \n15  limitations.  Here, as Defendant points out, the 2008 amendment also created Plaintiffsโ \n16  cause of action against Defendant.  Plaintiffsโ Complaint rests on TVPAโs โfinancial \n17  benefitโ cause of action to the TVPA.  See 18 U.S.C. ยง 1595(a); (Compl. ยถ 43.)  Congress \n18  created this cause of action as part of the 2008 amendments.  122 Stat. at 5067.  Thus, the \n19  Court must determine whether the โfinancial benefitโ provision applies retroactively.   \n20  The first Landgraf step is to determine whether Congress expressly mandated the \n21  statuteโs โproper reach.โ  511 U.S. at 280.  As the Cruz court recognized, Congress did not \n22  identify the 2008 TVPA amendmentโs proper temporal scope.  At the second step in the \n23  analysis, our path diverges from Cruz.  In 2008, Congress created a new cause of actionโ\n24  the financial benefit prong of ยง 1595(a)โwhich Plaintiffs utilize.  The new cause of action \n25  โincrease[s] a partyโs liability for past conduct.โ  Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 280.  Before the \n26  2008 amendments, Defendant was not liable because the โfinancial benefitโ element cause \n27  of action did not exist.  After the amendments, Defendant is potentially liable.  Because \n28  Defendant is liable after the amendment, but not liable before, the 2008 amendments create \n24 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.375   Page 25 of 51\n \n1  new legal consequences.  Therefore, the 2008 amendments do not apply retroactively \n2  barring Congressโs clear intent to do so.  The amendments do not contain any clear intent \n3  to apply retroactively.  See Cruz, 773 F.3d at 144.   \n4  Accordingly,  the  Court  finds  that  Plaintiffs  may  only  bring  claims  under  the \n5  โfinancial benefitโ prong for violations of the TVPA after the amendmentsโ effective date.7 \n6  4.  Whether TVPAโs Statute of Limitations Bar Plaintiffsโ Claims \n7  Defendant argues that a ten-year statute of limitations governs TVPA claims and \n8  Plaintiffs filed their Complaint May 31, 2017.  (MTD 20 (citing Compl.).)  Thus, Plaintiffs \n9  cannot bring any TVPA claims for conduct occurring before May 31, 2007.  (Id. at 21.)  \n10  Plaintiffs respond that dismissal on the basis of statute of limitations is only proper if \n11  Defendant shows some obvious bar to securing relief on the face of the Complaint.  (Oppโn \n12  23 (citing ASARCO, LLC v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., 765 F.3d 999, 1004 (9th Cir. 2014)).)  \n13  Plaintiffs argue that a factual question exists whether equitable tolling would apply to their \n14  claims.  Defendant rejoins that Plaintiffs have shown no factual basis for equitable tolling.  \n15  (Reply 13.) \n16  The Court agrees with Plaintiffs.  โIf, from the allegations of the complaint as well \n17  as any judicially noticeable materials, an asserted defense raises disputed issues of fact, \n18  dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is improper.โ  ASARCO, LLC, 765 F.3d 999, 1004 (9th Cir. \n19  2014) (quoting Scott v. Kuhlmann, 746 F.2d 1377, 1378 (9th Cir. 1984) (per curiam)).  \n20  Defendant points out that Plaintiffs do not state a factual basis for equitable tolling.  The \n21  Complaint suggests otherwise.  Plaintiffs were held in a civil immigration detention facility \n22  and it is plausible that equitable tolling could apply because Plaintiffs were physically \n23 \n24                                                                   \n25  7 Plaintiffs also argue that they seek mandatory restitution under 18 U.S.C. ยง 1593, which has no โfinancial \nbenefitโ requirement and, thus, no retroactivity issue.  (Oppโn 23 n.7.)  Plaintiffsโ argument fails because \n26  ยง 1593โs mandatory restitution provision is a remedy that applies โonly to cases in which a defendant has \nbeen convicted of an offense under the Trafficking Act.โ  United States v. Fu Sheng Kuo, 620 F.3d 1158, \n27 \n1164 (9th Cir. 2010) (citing 18 U.S.C. ยง 1593(a)).  Section 1593 requires a predicate โoffense under this \nchapter.โ  Even assuming a civil remedy can supply the predicate offense, the above discussion confirms \n28 \nthat Plaintiffsโ TVPA cause of action against Defendant was not available until December 23, 2008. \n25 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.376   Page 26 of 51\n \n1  detained at Defendantโs facility.  At the very least, there is a factual dispute concerning \n2  Defendantโs affirmative defense.  See Scott, 746 F.2d at 1377 (citing C. Wright & A. Miller, \n3  Federal Practice and Procedure, ยง 1277, at 328โ30).  Therefore, the Court declines to \n4  impose a statute of limitations bar at this stage in the proceedings. \n5  5.  Conclusion  \n6  In sum, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Defendantโs Motion \n7  to Dismiss Plaintiffsโ first cause of action.  The Court DISMISSES WITH PREJUDICE \n8  Plaintiffsโ claims to the extent those claims rely on ยง 1595(a)โs โfinancial benefitโ element \n9  and arose prior to December 23, 2008. \n10  B. California TVPA (Second Cause of Action) \n11  Plaintiffs bring a cause of action under the California Trafficking Victims Protection \n12  Act, Cal. Civ. Code ยง 52.5, which provides a state civil remedy for victims of human \n13  trafficking, (Compl. ยถ 53).  Defendant argues that, like the federal TVPA, the California \n14  legislature did not intend for the California human trafficking statute to prohibit Defendant \n15  from requiring lawfully-held immigration detainees to perform housekeeping tasks.  (MTD \n16  21.)  In support of this contention, Defendant references the legislative intent as only \n17  intending to reach โtrafficking of a person for forced labor or services.โ  (Id. (quoting 2005 \n18  Cal. Legis. Serv. Ch. 240 (A.B. 22)).)  Defendant also briefly mentions its preemption \n19  argument, which it raises below with regard to Plaintiffsโ minimum wage claims.  See infra \n20  section III.A.  Defendant argues that immigrant detention is a federal function and the \n21  California law has no authority to govern the conditions of detention.  (MTD 21.)  Next, \n22  Defendant points out that California Penal Code ยง 2700 requires prisoners in the custody \n23  of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to perform work.  From \n24  that premise, Defendant argues the California would not have criminalized conduct in one \n25  statute, the California TVPA, that it authorized in a different statute, California Penal Code \n26  ยง 2700.  (Reply 13.)  Finally, Defendant argues that Plaintiffsโ Complaint fails to allege \n27  sufficient facts to state a claim.  (MTD 22 (citing Loftus v. Long Beach Veterans Hosp., \n28  214 F. Supp. 3d 908, 916 (C.D. Cal. 2016)).) \n26 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.377   Page 27 of 51\n \n1  Plaintiffs argue that the plain meaning of California Penal Code ยง 236.1(a) governs \n2  their claims.  (Oppโn 26.)  They further contend that section 236.1 does not contain any \n3  limiting language that might restrict application of the statute to only those defendants who \n4  traffic in persons.  (Id.)  Relevant to their argument, section 236.1(g) states that the \n5  โLegislature finds that the definition of human trafficking in this section is equivalent to \n6  the federal definition of a severe form of trafficking found in Section 7102(9) of Title 22 \n7  of the United States Code.โ8  Cal. Penal Code ยง 236.1(g).  Plaintiffs contend that this \n8  definition is merely a declaration of legislative finding and does not control sections \n9  236.1(a) and (b).  (Oppโn 26.)  Next, Plaintiffs argue that they are not prisoners nor in the \n10  custody of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitations and therefore any \n11  comparison to prisoners in state custody is misleading.  (Id. at 27.)  Finally, Plaintiffs \n12  contend that they have alleged sufficient facts to state a claim.  (Id. at 27โ28 (citing Compl. \n13  ยถยถ 10โ11, 13โ16, 27โ29).) \n14  California Civil Code ยง 52.5 states that โ[a] victim of human trafficking, as defined \n15  in Section 236.1 of the Penal Code, may bring a civil action.โ  California Penal Code \n16  section 236.1 provides, in relevant part, that โ[a] person who deprives or violates the \n17  personal liberty of another with the intent to obtain forced labor or services, is guilty of \n18  human trafficking.โ  Cal. Penal Code ยง 236.1(a).  โAs summarized in the official standard \n19  jury instructions for criminal cases, the elements of this offense are (1) the defendant either \n20  deprived another person of personal liberty or violated that other personโs personal liberty; \n21  and (2) when the defendant did so, he or she intended to obtain forced labor or services \n22 \n                                                                 \n23 \n8 22 U.S.C. ยง 7102(9) provides: \nThe term โsevere forms of trafficking in personsโ meansโ \n24 \n(A) sex trafficking in which a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, \n25  or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such act has not \nattained 18 years of age; or \n26  (B) the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a \nperson for labor or services, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for \n27 \nthe purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, \nor slavery. \n28 \n \n27 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.378   Page 28 of 51\n \n1  from that person.โ  People v. Halim, 14 Cal. App. 5th 632, 643 (Ct. App. 2017) (citing \n2  CALCRIM No. 1243), rehโg denied (Sept. 12, 2017), review denied (Nov. 29, 2017).  The \n3  statute further defines โ[d]eprivation or violation of the personal liberty of anotherโ as  \n4  substantial  and  sustained  restriction  of  anotherโs  liberty \naccomplished  through  force,  fear,  fraud,  deceit,  coercion, \n5 \nviolence, duress, menace, or threat of unlawful injury to the \n6  victim  or  to  another  person,  under  circumstances  where  the \nperson receiving or apprehending the threat reasonably believes \n7 \nthat it is likely that the person making the threat would carry it \n8  out. \n9 \nCal. Penal Code ยง 236.1(h)(3). \n10 \nAs before, the Court begins with the plain meaning of the statute.  See Mt. Hawley \n11 \nIns. Co. v. Lopez, 215 Cal. App. 4th 1385, 1397 (2013); see also Klein v. United States, 50 \n12 \nCal. 4th 68, 77 (2010) (โWe look first to the words of the statute, โbecause the statutory \n13 \nlanguage is generally the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.โโ (quoting Hassan v. \n14 \nMercy Am. River Hosp., 31 Cal. 4th 709, 715 (2003))).  The California TVPA differs from \n15 \n18 U.S.C. ยง 1859 because the former includes an explicit reference to the federal definition \n16 \nof human trafficking, found in 22 U.S.C. ยง 7102(9).  See Cal. Penal Code ยง 236.1(a), (g).  \n17 \nHowever, the definition of human trafficking is not an element of the substantive offense; \n18 \ninstead, it defines the result of the crime.  As People v. Halim and the California jury \n19 \ninstruction illustrate, the only two elements necessary to prove a ยง 236.1 crime are: (1) the \n20 \ndefendant either deprived another person of personal liberty or violated that other personโs \n21 \npersonal liberty; and (2) when the defendant did so, he or she intended to obtain forced \n22 \nlabor or services from that person.  As in the federal TVPA, there is no language that limits \n23 \nthe โpersonโ to someone who was trafficked, nor is trafficking an element of the offense. \n24 \nDefendant argues that the California legislature would not criminalize conduct in \n25 \none statute, Cal. Penal Code ยง 236.1, only to explicitly authorize the same conduct in a \n26 \ndifferent statute, Cal. Penal Code ยง 2700.  (Reply 13.)  Defendantโs point is well taken; \n27 \nhowever, the Court distinguishes between the targets of each statute.  California Penal Code \n28 \nยง 2700 regulates the conduct of prisoners who are expressly exempt from the Thirteenth \n28 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.379   Page 29 of 51\n \n1  Amendmentโs  prohibition  on  involuntary  servitude.    California  Penal  Code  ยง  236.1 \n2  regulates conduct of private parties who are not exempt from the Thirteenth Amendmentโs \n3  prohibition of involuntary servitude.  The Court finds that the California TVPA is available \n4  to Plaintiffs.9 \n5  Moreover, the  Court  finds  Plaintiffs  state  a  claim  under  the  California  TVPA.  \n6  Plaintiffs allege that Defendant threatened to place non-compliant detainees in solitary \n7  confinement if they refused to perform certain labor.  As previously discussed, solitary \n8  confinement,  even  for  those  in  confinement  and  whose  liberty  is  already  deprived, \n9  constitutes  deprivation  of  personal  liberty.    Plaintiffs  also  allege  that  the  solitary \n10  confinement  was  a  punishment  for  refusing  to  perform  work,  which  demonstrates \n11  Defendantโs intent to obtain labor or services from Plaintiffs.  Thus, the Court finds that \n12  Plaintiffs state a claim under the California TVPA.   \n13  Though neither party raises the issue, retroactivity is also relevant here.  California \n14  Civil Code ยง 3 states that Civil Code provisions are not retroactive โunless expressly so \n15  declared.โ  Both sections 52.5 and 236.1 were enacted January 1, 2006 and neither statute \n16  expressly declared to have retroactive effect.  Headley v. Church of Scientology Intโl, No. \n17  CV  09-3986  DSF  (MANx),  2009  WL  10671565,  at  *4  (C.D.  Cal.  Aug.  12,  2009).  \n18  Therefore, Plaintiffsโ claim cannot state a claim for events that occurred prior to January \n19  1, 2006.  \n20  Therefore, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Defendantโs \n21  Motion as to Plaintiffsโ second cause of action and DISMISSES WITH PREJUDICE \n22  Plaintiffsโ California TVPA claim to the extent that it arose prior to January 1, 2006.   \n23 \n                                                                 \n24 \n9 Defendant advances a preemption argument, stating โdetention of immigrants is exclusively a federal \n25  function; California has no authority to govern the conditions of their detention.โ  Defendant does not \nelaborate  on  how  preemption  applies  specifically  to  the  California  TVPA  beyond  that  statement.  \n26  Defendant cites two statutesโthe Immigration and Nationality Act and the Immigration Reform and \nControl Actโfor its preemption argument.  (See MTD 22โ25.)  The Court addresses Defendantโs \n27 \npreemption argument in detail below, but the holding there applies equally here.  The Court finds that \nfederal law does not preempt California labor law from regulating Plaintiffsโ detention conditions; thus, \n28 \nDefendant has not demonstrated why the California TVPA may not also regulate detention conditions. \n29 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.380   Page 30 of 51\n \n1  III.  Voluntary Labor Claims (Fourth through Tenth Causes of Action) \n2  In these causes of action, Plaintiffs allege the following violations of the California \n3  Labor Code: failure to pay minimum wages; failure to pay overtime wages; failure to \n4  provide mandated meal periods; failure to provide mandated rest periods; failure to furnish \n5  timely  and  accurate  wage  statements;  failure  to  pay  compensation  upon \n6  termination/waiting  time  penalties;  imposition  of  unlawful  terms  and  conditions  of \n7  employment.  (See Compl. ยถยถ 71โ101.)  Before turning to the merits of Plaintiffsโ labor \n8  claims, the Court must address a threshold issue raised by Defendant: whether federal law \n9  preempts  California  law  to  the  extent  the  latter  seeks  to  regulate  civil  immigration \n10  detainees. \n11  A. Preemption \n12  Defendant raises a threshold objection to Plaintiffsโ fourth through tenth causes of \n13  action: preemption.  (MTD 22.)  Article VI, clause 2 of the United States Constitutionโ\n14  the Supremacy Clauseโcommands that the laws of the United States โshall be the supreme \n15  law of the land.โ  U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2.  โ[T]he Supremacy Clause invalidates all state \n16  laws that conflict or interfere with an Act of Congress.โ  Rose v. Ark. State Police, 479 U.S. \n17  1, 3 (1986).  Federal law may invalidate, or preempt, state law in three ways: express, field, \n18  and conflict preemption.  Silvas v. E*Trade Mortg. Corp., 514 F.3d 1001, 1004 (9th Cir. \n19  2008).  When federal laws regulate conduct in an area in which state law has historic police \n20  powers there is a strong presumption against preemption.  Id.  Accordingly, โcourts should \n21  assume that โthe historic police powers of the Statesโ are not superseded โunless that was \n22  the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.โโ  Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 400 \n23  (2012) (quoting Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.S. 218, 230 (1947)).  Conversely, \n24  the presumption against preemption does not apply โwhen [a] States regulates in an area \n25  where there has been a history of significant federal presence.โ  Silvas, 514 F.3d at 1004 \n26  (alteration  in  original)  (quoting  United  States  v.  Locke,  529  U.S.  89,  108  (2000)). \n27  Defendant argues both field and conflict preemption bar application of Californiaโs labor \n28  laws to Plaintiffsโ claims. \n30 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.381   Page 31 of 51\n \n1  1.  Field Preemption \n2  Defendant argues that the federal government has โbroad, undoubted power over the \n3  subject of immigration and the status of aliens.โ  Arizona, 567 U.S. at 394.  Accordingly, \n4  Congress has enacted two statutes relevant here.  The Immigration and Nationality Act \n5  (โINAโ) vests responsibility for detaining aliens with the U.S. Attorney General.  (MTD \n6  23 (citing, e.g., 8 U.S.C. ยงยง 1103, 1226, 1231).)  The Immigration Reform and Control Act \n7  (โIRCAโ) lays out a โcomprehensive scheme prohibiting the employment of illegal aliens \n8  in the United States.โ  (Id. (quoting Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. N.L.R.B., 535 U.S. \n9  137, 147 (2002)).)  Defendant argues that these two statutes reflect a congressional mandate \n10  to  regulate  the  detention  of  unlawful  immigrantsโincluding  employment  and  labor \n11  practices at detention facilities.  (Id.)  Thus, Defendant would have the Court find the INA \n12  and  IRCA  preempt  Californiaโs  labor  laws  and  those  state  laws  cannot  regulate \n13  Defendantโs conduct towards Plaintiffs.  (Id. at 24.) \n14  Plaintiffs counter that California labor laws do not intrude on INA and IRCAโs \n15  regulatory field.  (Oppโn 34.)  Plaintiffs cite Arizona v. United States where the Supreme \n16  Court held that Congress regulated the field of alien registration, but the Court allowed \n17  other provisions of the Arizona law intact.  (Id. (citing Arizona, 567 U.S. at 400โ15).)  \n18  Accordingly, Plaintiffs argue that Californiaโs labor laws do not intrude upon INAโs field \n19  of alien registration.  (Id.) \n20  Field preemption occurs โwhere: (1) the โregulatory framework is so pervasiveโ that \n21  there is no room for state regulation, or (2) where the โfederal interest [is] so dominant that \n22  the federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same \n23  subject.โ  Puente Ariz. v. Arpaio, 821 F.3d 1098, 1103 (9th Cir. 2016) (alteration in \n24  original) (quoting Arizona, 567 U.S. at 399).  Arizona v. United States is the Supreme \n25  Courtโs most recent pronouncement on preemption and immigration.   \n26  In Arizona, the Supreme Court examined four provisions of an Arizona law: (1) \n27  Section 3 created a misdemeanor for failing to comply with federal alien-registration \n28  requirements; (2) Section 5 created a misdemeanor for an unauthorized alien to seek or \n31 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.382   Page 32 of 51\n \n1  engage in work in Arizona; (3) Section 6 authorized law enforcement officers to arrest a \n2  person without a warrant if the officer had probable cause to believe the person had \n3  committed a public offense to make that person removable from the United States; and (4) \n4  Section 2(B) required officers who conducted a stop, detention, or arrest to verify a \n5  personโs immigration status.  567 U.S. at 393โ94.  The Supreme Court applied the field \n6  preemption doctrine to Section 3 because that section regulated conduct in the field of alien \n7  registration.  The Supreme Court held that โ[t]he framework enacted by Congress leads to \n8  the conclusion here . . . that the Federal Government has occupied the field of alien \n9  registration.โ  Id. at 401 (citing, e.g., Am. Ins. Assโn v. Garamendi, 539 U.S. 396, 419, n.11 \n10  (2003)).  The Court reasoned โ[i]f ยง 3 of the Arizona statute were valid, every State could \n11  give itself independent authority to prosecute federal registration violations, โdiminish[ing] \n12  the  [Federal  Government]โs  control  over  enforcementโ  and  โdetract[ing]  from  the \n13  โintegrated  scheme  of  regulationโ  created  by  Congress.โโ    Id.  at  402.  (alterations  in \n14  original) (quoting Wis. Depโt of Indus. v. Gould Inc., 475 U.S. 282, 288โ89 (1986)).  \n15  Accordingly, the Arizona court struck down Section 3 of the state law. \n16  Here, Defendant argues that the INA preempts any state regulation in the field of \n17  immigration detention.  (MTD 23 (citing Medina v. OโNeill, 589 F. Supp. 1028, 1038 (S.D. \n18  Tex. 1984)).)  At a high level of generality, Defendantโs proposition has support in both \n19  the statute and case law.  For example, 8 U.S.C. ยงยง 1226 & 1231 authorize the U.S. \n20  Attorney General to take into custody and detain an alien who is to be removed from the \n21  United States.  Additionally, in Arizona, the Supreme Court struck down the provision \n22  authorizing a state officer to arrest an alien without a warrant because the โfederal statutory \n23  structure instructs when it is appropriate to arrest an alien during the removal process.โ  \n24  567 U.S. at 407.  The Supreme Court characterized the relevant field as โalien registration,โ \n25  id. at 403, and Arizonaโs statute regulated conduct precisely in the alien registration field. \n26  Yet, the high court defined the relevant field narrowly.   None of the statutory \n27  sections  cited by  Defendant discuss  the detention of aliens.   The  Arizona  court was \n28  concerned when a state framework of sanctions creates a conflict with the plan Congress \n32 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.383   Page 33 of 51\n \n1  put in place.  Id. (citing Wis. Depโt, 475 U.S. at 286 (โ[C]onflict is imminent whenever two \n2  separate remedies are brought to bear on the same activity.โ)).  Thus, while Congress \n3  authorized the Attorney General to detain unlawful aliens there is no clear congressional \n4  framework for regulating detainee conditions, once unlawful aliens are detained in the first \n5  instance.  There is no clear congressional intent to occupy the field of detention conditions.  \n6  Without a clear congressional intent, โthe historic police powers of the Statesโ are not to \n7  be superseded.  Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U.S. 555, 565 (2009).   \n8  Carrying Defendantโs theory to its logical conclusion, if this Court were to find that \n9  Congress preempted California law in the entire field of civil immigration detention then \n10  California could not enforce state and local ordinances, including building codes, sanitation \n11  requirements, and other licensing strictures.  In fact, ICEโs operations manual10 explicitly \n12  requires contract detention facilities to follow applicable federal, state, and local law with \n13  regard to safety and sanitation law, fire safety codes, garbage and hazardous waste disposal, \n14  drinking and wastewater compliance, and food service.  See ICE PBNDS, at 19โ21, 228.    \n15  The Court finds that the INA does not regulate the entire field of detention conditions \n16  within an immigration detention facility. \n17  The Court next considers whether the IRCA provides the congressional intent to \n18  preempt the field of employment and labor practices in immigration detention facilities.  \n19  Prior to IRCAโs enactment, the Supreme Court noted that the โStates possess[ed] broad \n20  authority under their police powers to regulate the employment relationship to protect \n21  workers within the State.โ  Chamber of Commerce of U.S. v. Whiting, 563 U.S. 582, 588 \n22  (2011) (quoting De Canas v. Bica, 424 U.S. 351, 356 (1976), overruled in part by 8 U.S.C. \n23  ยง 1324a(h)(2)).  Again prior to IRCA, the Supreme Court had reasoned that โโprohibit[ing] \n24  the knowing employment . . . of persons not entitled to lawful residence in the United \n25  States, let alone to work here, is certainly within the mainstream of [the Stateโs] police \n26 \n                                                                 \n27 \n10 The ICE PBNDS is a federal agency publication and cannot provide congressional intent, but it at least \nprovides evidence that ICE does not read Congressโs intent as to control the entire field of conditions \n28 \nwithin immigration facilities. \n33 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.384   Page 34 of 51\n \n1  powerโ and that the Federal Government had โat bestโ expressed โa peripheral concern with \n2  [the] employment of illegal entrantsโ at that point in time.โ  Id. (alterations in original) \n3  (quoting De Canas, 424 U.S. at 356, 360).  Before IRCA, the Court declined to hold that \n4  federal immigration law preempted a state law assessing civil fines for the employment of \n5  unauthorized aliens.  See id.  Under this reasoning, a state law regulating the employment \n6  and labor of immigration detainees would most certainly withstand a preemption challenge. \n7  However, in 1986 Congress enacted IRCA and made it โunlawful for a person or \n8  other entity . . . to hire, or recruit or refer for a fee, for employment in the United States an \n9  alien knowing the alien is an unauthorized alien.โ  8 U.S.C. ยง 1324(a)(1)(A).  As the \n10  Supreme Court has stated, โIRCA โforcefullyโ made combating the employment of illegal \n11  aliens central to โ[t]he policy of immigration law.โโ  Hoffman Plastic Compounds, 535 U.S. \n12  at 147 (alteration in original) (quoting INS v. Natโl Ctr. for Immigrantsโ Rights, Inc., 502 \n13  U.S. 183, 194 & n.8 (1991)).  Yet, Defendant does not cite any cases for the proposition \n14  that IRCA preempts the entire field of immigration employment such that a state cannot \n15  applying its worker protection and employment regulations to unauthorized aliens.  See \n16  Salas v. Sierra Chemical Co., 59 Cal. 4th 407, 423 (2014) (holding that โfederal regulation \n17  imposed by the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 is not so pervasive as to \n18  leave no room for any state law on the same subjectโ).   \n19  The Court finds that Congress has not preempted state law in the field of immigration \n20  detainee labor and employment.  See Washington v. Geo Group, Inc., 283 F. Supp. 3d 967, \n21  977 (W.D. Wash. 2017) (finding same). \n22  2.  Conflict Preemption  \n23  Defendant also argues that Plaintiffsโ minimum wage (fourth cause of action) and \n24  overtime wage (fifth cause of action) are preempted because those California laws conflict \n25  with federal law.  (MTD 24.)   \n26  Conflict preemption applies in two situationsโwhen it is impossible to comply with \n27  both state and federal law, or when the state law poses an obstacle to accomplishing and \n28  executing  Congressโ  purposes  and  objectives.    Bank  of  Am.  v.  City  &  Cnty.  of  San \n34 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.385   Page 35 of 51\n \n1  Francisco, 309 F.3d 551, 558 (9th Cir. 2002) (citing Fla. Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc. \n2  v. Paul, 373 U.S. 132, 142โ43 (1963)), as amended on denial of rehโg and rehโg en banc \n3  (Dec. 20, 2002); and Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 67 (1941)).  Like field preemption, \n4  the touchstone of the conflict preemption inquiry is congressional intent.  Puente Ariz., 821 \n5  F.3d at 1104 (citing Wyeth, 555 U.S. at 565). \n6  Defendant states that 8 U.S.C. ยง 1555(d) authorizes ICE to pay โallowance (at such \n7  rate as may be specified from time to time in the appropriation Act involved) to aliens, \n8  while held in custody under the immigration laws, for work  performed.โ  (MTD 24 \n9  (quoting 8 U.S.C. ยง 1555(d)).)  Defendant argues that Congress set the allowance rate not \n10  in excess of $1 per day in the 1978 Department of Justice Appropriation Act.  (Id. (citing \n11  Pub. L. No. 95-86, 91 Stat. 419, 426 (1977); and Alvarado Guevara v. I.N.S., 902 F.2d 394, \n12  396 (5th Cir. 1990)).)  Thus, Defendant argues that Californiaโs minimum wage and \n13  overtime wagesโboth of which require well over $1 per dayโconflict with the rate fixed \n14  by Congress.  (Id. at 25 (citing Cal. Labor Code ยงยง 510(a), 1197).) \n15  Plaintiffs point out that the $1 per day requirement was laid out in an appropriations \n16  bill.  (See Oppโn 35โ36.)  Plaintiffs argue that Congress did not preempt state labor law \n17  through a $1 per day appropriation.  (Id. at 36.)  Further, Plaintiffs posit that there is nothing \n18  in  the  appropriations  bill  that  makes  it  impossible  for  Defendant  to  comply  with \n19  Californiaโs  labor laws,  including  payment of the  minimum  wage.    (Id.)    Defendant \n20  responds by reiterating its position that the 1978 appropriations bill controls the wages \n21  Defendant can lawfully pay Plaintiffs.  (Reply 15.) \n22  The conflict preemption argument depends entirely on the 1978 Department of \n23  Justice appropriations bill.  See 91 Stat. at 426 (โFor expenses not otherwise provided \n24  for, . . . including . . . payment of allowances (at a rate not in excess of $1 per day) to aliens, \n25  while held in custody under the immigration laws, for work performed.โ).  Plaintiffs argue \n26  โ[t]here is nothing in that appropriations bill that makes it impossible for Defendant to \n27  comply with Californiaโs labor laws.โ  (Oppโn 36.)  This position is untenable.  Plaintiffs \n28  provide no authority that Defendant is able to ignore congressional mandates imposed on \n35 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.386   Page 36 of 51\n \n1  ICE and imposed on Defendant by contracting with ICE.  It cannot be true that Defendant \n2  must follow both Californiaโs minimum wage law (requiring well over $1 per day) and the \n3  1978 Appropriations Act (requiring no more than $1 a day) at the same time.  The operative \n4  question is whether the appropriations bill still controls to this day. \n5  The limited case law on this question is clearly split.  In 1992, the Federal Circuit \n6  determined the Fair Labor Standards Act (โFLSAโ) did not apply to INS detainees and \n7  cited with approval the 1978 Department of Justice appropriations bill.  See Guevara v. \n8  I.N.S., 954 F.2d 733, 1992 WL 1029, at *2 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (per curiam) (unpublished \n9  decision).  More recently, the district court for the District of Washington encountered the \n10  same fact pattern presently before this Court: civil immigration detainees sued a private, \n11  for-profit immigration detention corporation alleging that the defendant failed to meet the \n12  Washington state minimum wage law.  See Chao Chen v. Geo Group, Inc., 287 F. Supp. \n13  3d 1158, 2017 WL 6034365, at *1 (W.D. Wash. Dec. 6, 2017).  The Chao Chen court \n14  pointed out that while 8 U.S.C. ยง 1555(d) is still in effect, Congress has not specified any \n15  rate for detainee work since fiscal year 1979, despite knowing how to set a specific rate.  \n16  Id. at *4 (citing Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, Pub. L. No. 114-113, 129 Stat. \n17  2242, 2497 (2015)). \n18  This is a close question.  The Court begins with the general proposition, repeatedly \n19  expressed by the Supreme Court, that โ[i]n all pre-emption cases, and particularly in those \n20  in which Congress has โlegislated . . . in a field which the States have traditionally \n21  occupied,โ . . . we โstart with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States \n22  were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose \n23  of Congress.โโ  Wyeth, 555 U.S. at 565 (alterations in original) (quoting Medtronic, Inc. v. \n24  Lohr, 518 U.S. 470, 485 (1996)).  Regulating labor and wages is a historic police power \n25  belonging to the States.  See Salas, 59 Cal. 4th at 422 (citing De Canas, 424 U.S. at 356).  \n26  Thus, this Court will only find conflict preemption when Congress provides a clear and \n27  manifest  purpose.    Congress  appropriated  funds  for  the  federal  fiscal  year  ending \n28  September 30, 1978, including funds not to exceed $1 per day for aliens held in custody.  \n36 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.387   Page 37 of 51\n \n1  Congress did not include similar language in subsequent years, nor did it codify the $1 per \n2  day limitation in the United States Code.  This Court does not foreclose the possibility that \n3  Congress intended for the $1 per day ceiling to bind future parties, but does not find a clear \n4  and manifest purpose on these facts is not warranted.  Therefore, the Court declines to \n5  apply conflict preemption.11 \n6  Finally,  Defendant  does  not  raise  the  obstacle  preemption  element  of  conflict \n7  preemption.  See Hines, 312 U.S. at 67.  Moreover, given the lack of clear congressional \n8  intent as to the โDollar-A-Dayโ program, the Court finds the obstacle analysis to be \n9  coextensive with the conflict preemption analysis. \n10  B. Whether Plaintiffs Are Employees for Purposes of California Law \n11  Plaintiffsโ fourth cause of action seeks to recover minimum wages; their fifth cause \n12  of action is for recovery of overtime compensation.  (See Compl. ยถยถ 71โ79.)  California \n13  Labor Code ยง 1194 provides the civil remedy for unpaid minimum wages or overtime \n14  compensation.  See Cal. Labor Code ยง 1194(a).   \n15  Defendant offers three reasons why Plaintiffs are not employees under California \n16  law.  First, the Labor Code defines โemployeeโ differently within the code itself, depending \n17  on the chapter, part, article, or section.  (See MTD 26.)  In some sections the legislature \n18  expressly included aliens in the definition of employee.  (Id. (citing Cal. Labor Code \n19  ยงยง 350, 2501(c), 3351).)  Because the legislature did not define alien in the section relied \n20  on by Plaintiffs, many of who are aliens, in their Complaint, they are not employees.  (Id.)  \n21  Second, Defendant argues that IRCA โmakes it unlawful to knowingly hire or continue to \n22  employ an unauthorized alien.โ  (Id. (quoting Hilber v. Intโl Lining Tech., No. C 12-3 LB, \n23  2012 WL 3542421, at *1 (N.D. Cal. July 24, 2012)).)  Thus, according to Defendant it \n24  would be absurd to confer employee status on Plaintiffs when IRCA prevents hiring aliens.  \n25 \n                                                                 \n26 \n11 Additionally, the ICE manual provides that โ[t]he compensation is at least $1.00 (USD) per day.โ  ICE \n27 \nPBNDS, at 407 (emphasis added).  Thus, assuming ICEโs manual were to preempt state law, see Chao \nChen, 2017 WL 6034365, at *5 (finding Voluntary Work Program does not preempt Washington \n28 \nminimum wage law), the ICE manual prescribes a floor, not a ceiling for daily wage. \n37 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.388   Page 38 of 51\n \n1  Third, Defendant cites several Ninth Circuit cases where courts have found that prison \n2  inmates are not employees for purposes of the FLSA.  (Id. at 27 (citing, e.g., Burleson v. \n3  State of Cal., 83 F.3d 311, 313 (9th Cir. 1996)).)  Defendant also directs the Court to \n4  Alvarado Guevara v. I.N.S., 902 F.2d 394, 395 (5th Cir. 1990), where the Fifth Circuit held \n5  that immigration detainees, who performed various tasks for $1 a day, were not employees \n6  under the FLSA.  Defendant invites the Court to find the FLSA cases analogous to situation \n7  at bar. \n8  Before addressing Plaintiffsโ rebuttal arguments, the Court addresses the threshold \n9  issue of whether Plaintiffs can qualify as employees before considering the idiosyncrasies \n10  of the immigration detention situation.  The threshold question is not the immigration status \n11  of  Plaintiffs,  whether  IRCA  prohibits  Defendant  from  employing  them,  or  whether \n12  immigration detainees are similar to prisoners.  The threshold inquiry is much simpler: are \n13  Plaintiffs  employees  under  California  Labor  Code  ยง  1194.    If  the  answer  is  in  the \n14  affirmative, only then does the Court need to consider whether Plaintiffsโ status as aliens \n15  or immigration detainees necessitates an exception to the definition of employee.  If the \n16  answer is in the negative, the inquiry ends. \n17  1.  Whether Defendant Employs Plaintiffs Pursuant to Martinez v. Combs \n18  As Plaintiffs point out, the California Supreme Court addressed the definition of an \n19  employee who brings an action under California Labor Code ยง 1194 in Martinez v. Combs, \n20  49 Cal. 4th 35 (2010).  (Oppโn 39.)  The California Supreme Court noted that generally \n21  โemployeesโ may recover unpaid minimum and overtime wages under the terms of the \n22  applicable  wage  order  issued  by  the  Industrial  Welfare  Commission  (โIWCโ)  and \n23  California courts generally defer to the IWCโs definition of employee.  See id. at 60โ61.  \n24  After discussing the history of the IWCโs definition and the common law definition, the \n25  Martinez court went on to hold that โ[t]o employ, then under the IWCโs definition, has \n26  three alternative definitions.  It means: (a) to exercise control over the wages, hours or \n27  working conditions, or (b) to suffer or permit to work, or (c) to engage, thereby creating a \n28  common law employment relationship.  Id. at 64.  The court then emphasized that the \n38 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.389   Page 39 of 51\n \n1  IWCโs definition of the term โemployโ was in โno senseโ based on federal law.  Id. at 66.  \n2  While the IWC has expressly incorporated elements of the FLSA into select wage orders, \n3  the California Supreme Court concluded that there was no reason to substitute the FLSAโs \n4  โeconomic realityโ test for definitions in wage orders regularly adopted by the IWC.  Id. at \n5  67. \n6  Defendant argues that Plaintiffsโ reliance on Martinez is misplaced.  (Reply 16.)  \n7  Defendant reads Martinez as inapplicable to state prison inmates and therefore similar logic \n8  should extend to federal immigration detainees whose labor, wages, and conditions are \n9  completely controlled by ICE12 regulations.  (Id. at 16 n.5 (citing Cal. Code Reg. tit. 15, \n10  ยง 3041.2, which sets wages for inmate wages at $0.08 to $0.13 per hour).)   \n11  The Court disagrees with Defendant and applies Martinez.  Plaintiffsโ Complaint \n12  alleges that Defendant offered $1 per day to participate in a Voluntary Work Program.  \n13  (Compl. ยถยถ 15, 17.)  Plaintiffs list a variety of tasks actually completed by detainees \n14  including, but not limited to scrubbing bathrooms, sweeping, mopping, and waxing floors, \n15  and preparing and serving detainee meals.  (Id. ยถ 16.)  These allegations sufficiently support \n16  a  conclusion  that  Defendant  controlled  the  hours,  wages,  and  working  conditions  of \n17  detainees in their Otay Mesa facility.  ICEโs 2011 PBNDS reinforces such a finding.  The \n18  PBNDS states that โ[d]etainees shall not be permitted to work in excess of 8 hours daily, \n19  40 hours weekly.โ  ICE, PBNDS, at 407.  It also provides that โ[t]he compensation is at \n20  least $1.00 (USD) per day.โ  Id.  Finally, the manual requires that โ[a]ll detention facilities \n21  shall comply with all applicable health and safety regulations standards.โ  Id. at 408.  \n22  Assuming Defendant adheres to ICEโs policies, and there is no reason offered in the record \n23 \n                                                                 \n24 \n12  Defendant  refers  to  the  regulations  as  โINS  regulations.โ    (Reply  16.)    The  Immigration  and \n25  Naturalization Service, or INS, was abolished in 2003, see Pub. L No. 107-296, ยง 471, 116 Stat. 2135, \n2205 (2002), and its duties were divided into ICE, Customs and Border Patrol, and U.S. Citizenship and \n26  Immigration Services.  The Court assumes that Defendant meant to refer to ICE regulations, but Defendant \ndoes not cite which specific regulations control housekeeping chores or voluntary work programs.  \n27 \nBecause the 2011 ICE PBNDS discusses both housekeeping chores and the voluntary work program and \napplies to โContract Detention Facilities,โ see ICE PBNDS, at 405, the Court again assumes Defendant \n28 \nrefers to that manual. \n39 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.390   Page 40 of 51\n \n1  to think otherwise, then the logical conclusion is that, at a minimum, Defendant controls \n2  the wages, hours, and working conditions of Plaintiffs and putative class members.  As \n3  such, Defendant employed Plaintiffs and putative class members for purposes of California \n4  Labor Code ยง 1194. \n5  Defendantโs argument that Martinez does not apply to Plaintiffs is not persuasive.  \n6  To arrive at its conclusion, Defendant compares Plaintiffs to state prison inmates, who are \n7  excluded from the IWCโs scope.  (See Reply 16.)  Yet, the California Penal Code expressly \n8  exempts inmates from the Labor Codeโs minimum wage requirements.  See Cal. Penal \n9  Code ยง 2811.  Indeed, the Thirteenth Amendmentโs prohibition on involuntary servitude \n10  does not apply to convicted criminals.  The only authority Defendant cites for treating civil \n11  immigration detainees the same as inmates are ICE regulations.  (Reply 16.)  Yet, the ICE \n12  regulations only set a floor, not a ceiling.  ICE PBNDS, at 405 (โThe compensation is at \n13  least 1.00 (USD) per day.โ (emphasis added)).  The Court finds such guidance insufficient, \n14  especially compared to the clear statement in Penal Code ยง 2811, to exempt Plaintiffs from \n15  Martinez. \n16  2.  Whether the Labor Code Expressly Includes Immigration Detainees \n17  The Court turns to the Defendantโs arguments why the Labor Code should not apply \n18  to Plaintiffs, even if Defendant employs detainees.  Defendant first argues that the Labor \n19  Code defines โemployeeโ deliberately based on the respective chapter, part, article, or \n20  section.  (MTD 26.)  In some Labor Code sections the legislature expressly included aliens \n21  in the definition of employee.  (Id. (citing Cal. Labor Code ยงยง 350, 2501(c), 3351).)  But, \n22  the legislature did not include alien detainees in the definition of employee in the statutes \n23  in Plaintiffsโ Complaint and, thus, Defendant urges the Court not to read โimmigrant \n24  detaineeโ into the Labor Code.  (Id.)   \n25  Plaintiffs counter that Labor Code ยง 1171.5 expresses a clear intent by the California \n26  Legislature to accord all individuals โregardless of immigration statusโ the protections, \n27  rights, and remedies under state law.  Cal. Labor Code ยง 1171.5(a).  Plaintiffs cite Incalza \n28  v. Fendi North America, Inc., 479 F.3d 1005, 1009 (9th Cir. 2007), as recognizing that \n40 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.391   Page 41 of 51\n \n1  illegal aliens, like other California employees, cannot be terminated in violation of an \n2  express or implied agreement without good cause.  (Oppโn 38.)  Plaintiffs argue Incalza is \n3  exemplary of a multitude of decisions, both state and federal, finding that illegal aliens are \n4  protected under the California Labor Code. (Id. at 38 & n.11 (collecting cases).) \n5  Defendant responds that Plaintiffs are not employees so Labor Code ยง 1171.5 does \n6  not apply to them.  (Reply 16.)  Defendant emphasizes that the relevant inquiry is not \n7  Plaintiffsโ immigration status, but rather their detention status.  (Id. at 15โ16.)   \n8  Plaintiffs bring causes of action under Labor Code ยง 1194.  Martinez describes the \n9  applicable test to determine whether a person is engaged in employment for purposes of \n10  section 1194.  The Court found that Plaintiffs meet the Martinez definition and are therefore \n11  engaged in employment and able to bring claims under ยง 1194.  The Court agrees with \n12  Defendant that Plaintiffs do not answer the thrust of Defendantโs argument: that the Labor \n13  Code does not define employee as an alien held in a detention center.  Yet, the inverse is \n14  also true, Defendant has not demonstrated that the Labor Code, or any case law, specifically \n15  exempts alien detainees from the Labor Code.  Defendant invites comparison to Gerard v. \n16  Mitchell Systems, No. CV 14-4999 DSF (SHX), 2016 WL 4479987, at *8 (C.D. Cal. Aug. \n17  22, 2016),  where the  district court  determined  that  cosmetology  students  required to \n18  perform housekeeping chores without pay did not fall under the applicable IWC wage \n19  order.  Defendant argues that the federal ICE regulations are similar to the cosmetology \n20  regulations that displaced the IWC wage order.  Gerard relied on a California Court of \n21  Appeal decision that explicitly held cosmetology students did not fall under the IWC.  See \n22  2016 WL 4479987, at *7โ8 (citing Hutchison v. Clark, 67 Cal. App. 2d 155, 160โ61 (Ct. \n23  App. 1944)).  Defendant does not cite, nor can the Court find, a similar case holding that \n24  alien detainees do not fall under the IWCโs sweep.  Without any similar precedent, the \n25  Court declines to create an exception for civil immigration detainees removing them from \n26  IWCโs purview. \n27  3.  Whether IRCA Prohibits Defendant from Employing Plaintiffs \n28  Defendant next argues that Plaintiffsโ legal theory creates an absurdity because of \n41 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.392   Page 42 of 51\n \n1  IRCA.  IRCA โmakes it unlawful to knowingly hire or continue to employ an unauthorized \n2  alien.โ  (MTD 26 (quoting Hilber, 2012 WL 3542421, at *1).)  Thus, if civil immigration \n3  detainees are unauthorized aliens then Defendant could not knowingly hire or continue to \n4  employ those unauthorized aliens.  (See id. at 26โ27.) \n5  Plaintiffs respond that the California Supreme Court has held that statutory labor \n6  provisions are available to all workers โregardless of immigration status.โ  (Oppโn 37 \n7  (quoting Salas, 59 Cal. 4th at 426).)  According to Plaintiffs, federal law does not preempt, \n8  (id. at 38 (citing Salas, 59 Cal. 4th at 421โ24)), the California Legislatureโs clear intent to \n9  provide unauthorized aliens all protections, rights, and remedies under state law, (id. \n10  (citing, e.g., Cal. Gov. Code ยง 7285)). \n11  The Court agrees with Defendantโs general principal that IRCA prohibits employers \n12  from employing unauthorized aliens and if any detainees were unauthorized aliens then \n13  Defendant would be prohibited from employing unauthorized aliens.  Civil immigration \n14  detention facilities house persons as their immigration status is adjudicated.  Logic would \n15  suggest at least some of Plaintiffsโ putative class would fall under IRCAโcreating a legal \n16  Gordian knot for Defendant.  Two considerations allow the Court to cut the proverbial \n17  knot.  First, the Court has no information or allegation concerning Plaintiffsโ immigration \n18  status.  (See Compl. ยถยถ 27โ29.)  The Motion before the Court is not class certification, but \n19  rather whether these particular Plaintiffs state a claim.  Thus, Defendantโs argument, while \n20  potentially relevant in future motions, is not dispositive here.  Second, as Plaintiffs point \n21  out, California law provides a remedy for unauthorized aliens.  See Cal. Labor Code \n22  ยงยง 1171.5, 1194; Salas, 59 Cal. 4th at 426.  The relevant inquiry is not whether Defendant \n23  violated IRCA, but whether Plaintiffs can recover under California law for past wrongs.  \n24  Thus, the Court finds IRCA does not control the issue of whether Plaintiffs are employees \n25  under California law. \n26  4.  Whether Immigration Detainees Are Analogous to Prisoners \n27  The  Court  turns  to  the  subset  of  persons  perhaps  most  similarly  situated  to \n28  immigration detainees: state prison inmates.  Defendant argues that courts have repeatedly \n42 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.393   Page 43 of 51\n \n1  held prison inmates are not employees for purposes of the FLSA, (MTD 27 (citing, e.g., \n2  Burleson, 83 F.3d at 313; and Hale v. Arizona, 993 F.2d 1387, 1389 (9th Cir.) (en banc), \n3  cert. denied, 510 U.S. 946 (1993))), the Americans with Disabilities Act, (id. (citing Castle \n4  v. Eurofresh, Inc., 731 F.3d 901, 906โ08 (9th Cir. 2013)), and the Toxic Substances Control \n5  Act and Clean Air Act, (id. (citing Coupar v. U.S. Depโt of Labor, 105 F.3d 1263, 1265 \n6  (9th Cir. 1997))).  Defendant also points the Court to Alvarado Guevara v. I.N.S., 902 F.2d \n7  at 395, where the Fifth Circuit held that immigrant detainees who performed housekeeping \n8  tasks were not employees under the FLSA, (MTD 27). \n9  Plaintiffsโ counter that the California Supreme Court has rejected the application of \n10  the common law definition of employer as well as the FLSAโs โeconomic realityโ test.  \n11  (Oppโn 39 (citing Martinez, 49 Cal. 4th at 64).)  Plaintiffs also argue that even if the Court \n12  applied the FLSA economic reality test then they still qualify as employees.  (See id. 39โ\n13  40.)  Plaintiffs point to the Hale courtโs statement, quoted with approval in Burleson, that \n14  the Ninth Circuit does โnot believe that prisoners are categorically excluded from the \n15  FLSA.โ  (Id. at 39 (quoting Burleson, 83 F.3d at 313).)  Thus, Plaintiffs argue that if the \n16  Court were to apply the economic reality test, articulated in Bonnette v. California Health \n17  and Welfare Agency, 704 F.2d 1465 (9th Cir. 1983), then civil immigration detainees would \n18  be situated differently than state prisoners.  (See Oppโn 40.)  Plaintiffs state the single \n19  determinative factor under the economic reality test is whether immigration detainees have \n20  a legal obligation to work.  (Id. (citing Hale, 993 F.2d at 1395).)  Thus, Plaintiffs contend \n21  that they, unlike prisoners, are under no obligation to work.  (See id. at 40โ41.)  Applying \n22  the  remaining  Bonnette  factors,  Plaintiffs  contend  that  Defendant  controls  the  hours, \n23  wages, and hiring and firing of detainee workers and, therefore, Plaintiffs qualify as \n24  employees under the economic reality test.  (Id. at 41.)   \n25  In response, Defendant reiterates that Plaintiffs fail to address Alvarado Guevara \n26  and Menocal.  (Reply 17.)  Alvarado Guevara determined that civil immigration detainees \n27  were not employees for purposes of the FLSA.  (Id. (citing Alvarado Guevara, 902 F.2d at \n28  395).)  Moreover, Defendant points to a case cited by Plaintiffs, Menocal, which reasoned \n43 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.394   Page 44 of 51\n \n1  that immigration detainees were similar to prisoners and concluded that immigration \n2  detainees were not employees for purposes of Coloradoโs minimum wage law.  (Id. (citing \n3  Menocal, 113 F. Supp. 3d at 1129).) \n4  Defendant cites several cases where courts found prison inmates were not employees \n5  for purposes of various federal statutes, like the Americans with Disabilities Act and the \n6  Clean Air Act.  These cases share a common precedent and common analysis framework: \n7  Hale v. Arizona, 993 F.2d 1387.  Defendantโs diverse array of cases relying on Hale also \n8  relies  on  FLSAโs  economic  reality  test  employed  in  Hale.    For  example,  Castle  v. \n9  Eurofresh, Inc., 731 F.3d at 906โ08, explicitly relied on Hale to hold that an inmate was \n10  not an employee.  See id. at 908 (โWe are equally unpersuaded by [the plaintiffโs] other \n11  attempts to distinguish this case from Hale and Coupar.โ).  Thus, Defendantโs primary \n12  argument boils down to the following proposition: courts regularly find that prison inmates \n13  not employees under FLSA and the Court should apply this reasoning to immigration \n14  detainees under Californiaโs Labor Code. \n15  The defect in Defendantโs argument is that Californiaโs employment definition is \n16  explicitly different from FLSAโs economic reality test.  See Martinez, 49 Cal. 4th at 66โ\n17  67.  The California Supreme Court cannot be much clearer when it said โ[i]n no sense is \n18  the IWCโs definition of the term โemployโ based on federal law.โ  Id. at 66.  Moreover, the \n19  Martinez court reiterated that it had โpreviously cautioned against โconfounding federal \n20  and state labor law.โโ  Id. at 68 (quoting Ramirez v. Yosemite Water Co., 20 Cal. 4th 785, \n21  798 (1999)).  And, while the IWCโs wage orders are at times patterned after federal \n22  regulations, the wage orders sometimes provide greater protection than is provided under \n23  federal law.  Ramirez, 20 Cal. 4th at 795 (collecting cases).  Defendantโs analysis does not \n24  bridge the gap between Californiaโs Labor Code and the FLSA.  Put differently, Martinez \n25  explicitly  distinguishes  the  California  IWC  definition  of  โto  employโ  from  FLSAโs \n26  economic reality test.  Moreover, Defendant does not offer a convincing reason to apply a \n27  test disavowed by the California Supreme Court. \n28  Even if the Court were to apply the economic reality test it is not clear that Plaintiffs \n44 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.395   Page 45 of 51\n \n1  do not qualify as employees.  Hale held that inmates were not employees of the prison \n2  because  they  โworked  for  programs  structured  by  the  prison  pursuant  to  the  stateโs \n3  requirement that prisoners work at hard labor, the economic reality is that their labor \n4  belonged  to  the  institution.โ    993  F.2d  at  1395.    Hale  distinguished  prisoners  from \n5  employees in the free market because โ[c]onvicted criminal do not have the right to freely \n6  sell their labor and are not protected by the Thirteenth Amendment against involuntary \n7  servitude.โ  Id. at 1394 (citing Draper v. Rhay, 315 F.2d 193, 197 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, \n8  375 U.S. 915 (1963)). \n9  Here, California Penal Code ยง 2700 mandates that โevery able-bodied prisoner \n10  imprisoned in any state prisonโ are required to carry out โas many hours of faithful labor \n11  in each dayโ as prescribed by the Director of Corrections.  Like the Hale courtโs reasoning, \n12  California inmates cannot freely sell their labor and are exempted from the Thirteenth \n13  Amendmentโs prohibition on involuntary servitude.  Defendant has not directed the Court \n14  to any similar statute for civil immigration detaineesโother than ICEโs regulations.  (See \n15  Reply 16.)  Yet, the ICE regulation clearly states, โDetainees shall be able to volunteer for \n16  work assignments but otherwise shall not be required to work, except to do personal \n17  housekeeping.โ  ICE PBNDS, at 405.  The ICE regulations are voluntary, not mandatory \n18  (excepting certain housekeeping tasks).  Plaintiffs are not convicted criminals and are \n19  accorded  the  protections  of  the  Thirteenth  Amendment.    See  supra  section  II.A.1.b \n20  (discussing Thirteenth Amendmentโs civic duty exception).  \n21  Defendant is correct that Plaintiffs do not directly address the holding in Alvarado \n22  Guevara, 902 F.2d at 395, (Reply 17).  Like here, Alvarado Guevara involved an alien \n23  detention facility that offered detainees the opportunity to participate in a voluntary work \n24  program for $1 per day.  902 F.2d at 395.  The Fifth Circuit held that the detainees were \n25  not employees under the FLSA.  Id.  In doing so, the court relied largely on one factor: that \n26  the FLSAโs intent was to protect the โstandard of livingโ and โgeneral well-beingโ of the \n27  worker in the American industry.  Id. (quoting Alexander v. Sara, Inc., 559 F. Supp. 42 \n28  (M.D. La.), affโd. 721 F.2d 149 (5th Cir. 1983)).  Because detainees were removed from \n45 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.396   Page 46 of 51\n \n1  the American economy, they were not employees under FLSA. \n2  While the factual situation between this case and Alvarado Guevara is similar, \n3  Alvarado Guevaraโs reasoning presupposes that the immigration detention facility exerts \n4  nearly the same level of control over a detainee as a prison does over a prisoner.  The \n5  question of control is important.  At common law, the employment relationship between \n6  an employer and independent contractor tested the amount of control the employer exerted \n7  over an independent contractor.  See Vanskike v. Peters, 974 F.2d 806, 810 (7th Cir. 1992) \n8  (citing Bonnette, 704 F.2d at 1470).  In the prison employment inquiry, a court approaches \n9  the  question  of  control  from  the  other  direction:  is  there  too  much  control  over  the \n10  purported employee.  See id. (โ[T]here is obviously enough control over the prisoner; the \n11  problematic point is that there is too much control to classify the relationship as one of \n12  employment.โ).  Thus, when Hale discussed the economic reality of a prisonerโs situation \n13  the  overriding  factor  was  that  the  relationship  between  prison  and  prisoner  was \n14  โpenological, no pecuniary.โ  993 F.2d at 1395. \n15  Here, it is not clear that Defendant exerts the same level of control over Plaintiffs as \n16  a prison does over a prisoner.  As discussed, Plaintiffs are not convicted criminals and have \n17  no obligation to work (other than the basic housekeeping tasks outlined in the PBNDS \n18  manual).  Consider the following hypothetical, based on the facts and allegations before \n19  the Court.  If all civil immigration detainees at Defendantโs Otay Mesa facility refused to \n20  participate in the Voluntary Work Program then Defendant could not force detainees to \n21  perform labor and services at the facility, beyond basic housekeeping tasks. Moreover, the \n22  ICE  regulations  require  the  facility  administrator  to  โensure  that  staff  and  detainees \n23  maintain a high standard of facility sanitation and general cleanliness.โ  ICE PBNDS, at \n24  21.    If  detainees  are  unavailable  for  sanitation  and  cleanliness it is  conceivable that \n25  Defendant would hire persons to perform the tasks previously performed by detainees: \n26  cooking meals for detainees, cutting detaineesโ hair, and launder detaineesโ clothing.  (See \n27  Compl. ยถ 14.)  By comparison, a prison can control their inmates and require them, under \n28  the Thirteenth Amendment and California law, to perform those tasks for well under \n46 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.397   Page 47 of 51\n \n1  minimum wage.  Such a hypothetical illustrates that the level of control over detainees does \n2  not rise to the same level described in Hale and Vanskike. \n3  But, the foregoing economic reality discussion is, ultimately, not the applicable test \n4  to Plaintiffsโ situation.13  Instead, the IWC wage orders, which the California Supreme \n5  Court defers to, controls.  See Martinez, 49 Cal. 4th at 66โ67.  Accordingly, the Court finds \n6  Defendantโs analogy to prison employment cases does not address the critical issue in this \n7  caseโwhether Plaintiffs meet the definition of employee under Martinez.   \n8  C. Whether IWCโs Wage Orders Apply to Plaintiffs \n9  Defendant states that Plaintiffsโ fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh causes of action all \n10  rely, in part, on IWC Wage Orders (โWOโ) 5-2001 and 15-2001.  (MTD 28.)  Defendant \n11  argues reliance on both orders are misplaced. \n12  1.  Wage Order 5-2001 \n13  WO 5-2001 applies to the Public Housekeeping Industry and defines the industry to \n14  include  โany  industry,  business,  or  establishment  which  provides  meals,  housing,  or \n15  maintenance services whether operated as a primary business or when incidental to other \n16  operations in an establishment not covered by an industry order of the Commission.โ  (Id. \n17  (quoting Cal. Code Regs. tit. 8, ยง 11050(2)(P) (2017)).)  The Wage Order then provides an \n18  exemplary list of businesses that do not include corrections or detention facilities.  (Id. \n19  (citing Cal. Code Regs. tit. 8, ยง 11050(2)(P)(1)โ(7)).)  Defendant concludes that the \n20  illustrative list is not remotely similar to the detention of immigration detainees and urges \n21  the Court not to apply this Wage Order.  In response, Plaintiffs point out that the IWCโs \n22  occupations are the same as in their Complaint, e.g., janitorial services, landscaping, \n23 \n24                                                                   \n25  13 Defendant also argues that an employment relationship cannot be found under the common law test \nbecause detention for the purposes of deportation does not support a reasonable belief that an employer-\n26  employee relationship existed.  (Reply 16โ17 (citing Bonnette, 704 F.2d at 1470; and S.G. Borello & Sons, \nInc. v. Depโt of Indus. Relations, 769 P.2d 399, 404 (Cal. 1989)).)  The Court acknowledges but does not \n27 \nmake a finding as to the common law employment relationship.  It does so because Martinez makes clear \nthat the IWCโs employment test is available for those persons, like Plaintiffs, who seek remedy under \n28 \nCalifornia Labor Code ยง 1194. \n47 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.398   Page 48 of 51\n \n1  catering, boarding, and cleaning of facilities.  (Oppโn 43.)   \n2  WO 5-2001โs plain language answers this issue.  Defendant operates a immigration \n3  detention facility.  In that capacity, Plaintiffs allege that they perform tasks concerning \n4  meals, housing, and maintenance.  (See Compl. ยถ 14.)  The wage order applies to any \n5  industry or business which provides meals, housing, or maintenance services even when \n6  the services is operated incidental to the businessโs other operations in an establishment \n7  not  covered  by  an  industry  order  of  the  IWC.    ยง  11050(2)(P).    Meals,  housing,  or \n8  maintenance clearly are not Defendantโs primary business purpose, but those services are \n9  provided incidental to its role in housing detainees.   \n10  Defendant argues that it is not โremotely similarโ to the examples listed in the wage \n11  order.  (MTD 28.)  The Court is not convinced the examples are so far afield as Defendant \n12  contends.  For example, the wage order cites โ[p]rivate schools, colleges, or universities, \n13  and similar establishments which provide board or lodging in addition to educational \n14  facilities.โ  ยง 11050(2)(P)(5).  It also offers as examples โ[h]ospitals, sanitariums, rest \n15  homes,  child  nurseries,  child  care  institutions,  homes  for  the  aged,  and  similar \n16  establishments  offering  board  or  lodging  in  addition  to  medical,  surgical,  nursing, \n17  convalescent, aged, or child care.โ  ยง 11050(2)(P)(4).  These two examples call to mind an \n18  institution where people remain for long periods of time for a purpose (education or \n19  healthcare) while receiving meals and lodging that are incidental to that purpose.  While \n20  the  purpose  of  the  institution  may  differโeducation  vs.  nursing  home  vs.  detention \n21  facilityโeach institution provides essential services for those under their charge.  Finally, \n22  as Defendant admits, the wage order list is not exhaustive. \n23  The Court declines to dismiss Plaintiffsโ Complaint to the extent it relies on Wage \n24  Order 5-2001. \n25  2.  Wage Order 15-2001 \n26  Defendant also argues that WO 15-2001 should not apply because the wage order \n27  only covers โall persons employed in household occupations.โ  (MTD 28 (citing Cal. Code \n28  Regs. tit. 8, ยง 11050(1)).)  โHousehold Occupationsโ is further defined as: \n48 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.399   Page 49 of 51\n \n1  [A]ll services related to the care of persons or maintenance of a \nprivate household or its premises by an employee of a private \n2 \nhouseholder. Said occupations shall include, but not be limited \n3  to, the following: butlers, chauffeurs, companions, cooks, day \nworkers, gardeners, graduate nurses, grooms, house cleaners, \n4 \nhousekeepers, maids, practical nurses, tutors, valets, and other \n5  similar occupations. \n6  (Id. at 28โ29 (citing Cal. Code Regs. tit. 8, ยง 11050(2)(I)).)  Defendant argues that it is not \n7  a private household, but rather a detention facility.  Plaintiffs do not address Defendantโs \n8  argument. \n9    The Court agrees with Defendant.  It is true that Plaintiffsโ allegations include some \n10  of these types of occupations like housekeepers, gardeners, and cooks.  (See Compl. ยถ 14.)  \n11  However, WO 15-2001 does not include all cooks, gardeners, and housekeepers; it only \n12  includes those services related to a โprivate household or its premises.โ  ยง 11050(2)(I).  \n13  Plaintiffs raise no argument why a private household includes a civil immigration detention \n14  facility.  The Court finds that Wage Order 15-2001 does not support Plaintiffsโ claims.  \n15  Accordingly,  the  Court  GRANTS  IN  PART  Defendantโs  Motion  and  DISMISSES \n16  WITHOUT PREJUDICE Plaintiffsโ claims in the fourth through seventh causes of action \n17  to the extent they rely on Wage Order 15-2001. \n18  IV.  Derivative Claims (Third, Eleventh, and Twelfth Causes of Action) \n19  Defendant argues that Plaintiffs remaining causes of action must fail to the extent \n20  Plaintiffsโ substantive claims are dismissed.  (MTD 29.)  In addition, Defendant argues \n21  Plaintiffsโ  unjust  enrichment  merits  special  attention  and  fails  regardless  of  whether \n22  Plaintiffsโ substantive claims succeed or fail.  (See id.) \n23  A. Unjust Enrichment (Twelfth Cause of Action) \n24  Defendant posits that Plaintiffsโ unjust enrichment claim must fail because unjust \n25  enrichment is an equitable remedy and an equitable theory of recovery is barred if an \n26  adequate remedy exists at law against the same person.  (MTD 29 (citing Mort v. United \n27  States, 86 F.3d 890, 892 (9th Cir. 1996)).)  Defendant explains that courts typically find \n28  unjust enrichment to be unavailable when a plaintiffโs other claims prove that adequate \n49 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.400   Page 50 of 51\n \n1  remedies exist.  (Id. (citing, e.g., Salas v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc., No. CV 15-\n2  8629 FMO (Ex), 2016 WL 7486600, at *13 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 27, 2016)).)  Thus, Defendant \n3  argues that Plaintiffsโ statutory causes of action under the TVPA and the California Labor \n4  Code  all  seek  redress  for  the  same  injuries  as  Plaintiffsโ  unjust  enrichment  claim.  \n5  Defendant urges the Court to limit Plaintiffsโ unjust enrichment claim accordingly. \n6  Plaintiffs counter that Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 8(a)(3) and 8(d)(2) allow \n7  them to plead alternative forms of relief.  (Oppโn 31.)  Furthermore, Plaintiffs point the \n8  Court to Astiana v. Hain Celestial Group, Inc., 783 F.3d 753, 762 (9th Cir. 2015), where \n9  the Ninth Circuit determined that a unjust enrichment claim should not be dismissed as \n10  duplicative of a plaintiffโs other claims according to Rule 8(d)(2).  (Oppโn 31.)   \n11  The issue here falls squarely under Astiana.  In California, there is no โstandalone \n12  cause of action for โunjust enrichment.โโ  Astiana, 783 F.3d at 762 (citing Durell v. Sharp \n13  Healthcare, 183 Cal. App. 4th 1350, 1370 (Ct. App. 2010); and Jogani v. Superior Court, \n14  165 Cal. App. 4th 901, 911 (Ct. App. 2008)).  California state courts are split on whether \n15  California law recognizes a cause of action for unjust enrichment.  See McMillan v. Loweโs \n16  Home Ctrs., LLC, No. 15-CV-695-KJM-SMS, 2016 WL 232319, at *6 (E.D. Cal. Jan. 20, \n17  2016) (citing Paskenta Band of Nomlaki Indians v. Crosby, No. 15-00538, 2015 WL \n18  4879650, at *6 (E.D. Cal. Aug. 14, 2015)).  However, Astiana interpreted California law \n19  to recognize that an unjust enrichment claim may be construed as an action in quasi-\n20  contract.  783 F.3d at 762.  The Astiana court went on to hold that where a plaintiff states \n21  a claim for relief under a quasi-contract cause of action that cause should not be dismissed \n22  as โduplicative or superfluousโ to the plaintiffโs other claims.  Id. (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23  8(d)(2)). \n24  โTo allege unjust enrichment as an independent cause of action, a plaintiff must \n25  show that the defendant received and unjustly retained a benefit at the plaintiffโs expense.โ  \n26  ESG Capital Partners, LP v. Stratos, 828 F.3d 1023, 1038โ39 (9th Cir. 2016) (citing \n27  Lectrodryer v. SeoulBank, 77 Cal. App. 4th 723, 726 (Ct. App. 2000)).  Here, Plaintiffs \n28  allegations sufficiently state a claim for unjust enrichment or quasi-contract.  Defendant \n50 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 38   Filed 05/14/18   PageID.401   Page 51 of 51\n \n1  received  the  value  of  Plaintiffsโ  labor  and  allegedly  did  not  adequately  compensate \n2  Plaintiffs.  The Court DENIES IN PART Defendantโs Motion as to Plaintiffsโ twelfth \n3  cause of action; however, the Court qualifies its holding as follows.  Astiana and Federal \n4  Rule of Civil Procedure 8(d)(2) allow Plaintiffs to plead alternative causes of action, but \n5  the Court understands that Plaintiffs cannot recover twice for the same injury.  Gen. Tel. \n6  Co. of the Nw., Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commโn, 446 U.S. 318, 333 (1980) \n7  (citation omitted) (โIt also goes without saying that the courts can and should preclude \n8  double recovery by an individual.โ). \n9  B. Remaining Derivative Claims (Third and Eleventh Causes of Action) \n10  Defendant argues that Plaintiffsโ derivative causes of actionโCalifornia Unfair \n11  Competition Law and Negligenceโshould be dismissed as they rely entirely on violations \n12  of the federal and California TVPA and California Labor Code.  (MTD 29.)  Because \n13  Plaintiffs claims survive this Motion, the Court will not dismiss Plaintiffsโ derivative \n14  claims.  Thus, the Court DENIES IN PART Defendantโs Motion as to Plaintiffsโ third and \n15  eleventh causes of action. \n16  CONCLUSION \n17    In light of the following, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART \n18  Defendantโs Motion to Dismiss, (ECF No. 18).  Additionally, the Court LIFTS the stay on \n19  these proceedings. \n20  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n21 \nDated:  May 14, 2018   \n22 \n   \n23   \n \n24 \n \n25 \n \n26 \n27 \n28 \n51 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) ",

Plaintiff Sylvester Owino is a resident of the County of San Diego, in \n18  the State of California.  Mr. Owino was a civil immigration detainee who worked at \n19  CoreCivic's Otay Mesa Detention Center at various times from November 7, 2005 \n20  through March 9, 2015. \n21  8.   Plaintiff Jonathan Gomez is a resident of the County of San Diego, in \n22  the State of California.  Mr. Gomez was a civil immigration detainee who worked at \n23  CoreCivic's  Otay  Mesa  Detention  Center  at  various  times  from  June  14,  2012 \n24  through September 18, 2013. \n25  9.  Defendant CoreCivic, Inc. is a Maryland corporation with its principal \n26  place of business at 10 Burton Hills Blvd., Nashville, Tennessee 37125. \n27   \n28   \n  - 2 - \n \nSylvester Owino, et al. v. CoreCivic, Inc.  \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 1   Filed 05/31/17   PageID.4   Page 4 of 36\n \n1  SUMMARY AND COMMON FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n2  10.  Plaintiffs  are  former  civil  immigration  detainees  who  bring  this \n3  proposed class action lawsuit on behalf of all civil immigration detainees who were \n4  incarcerated and forced to work by CoreCivic, a for-profit corporation engaged in \n5  the  business  of  owning  and  operating  detention  facilities  and  prisons  from \n6  January 1, 2004 to the opt-out date, inclusive (the โClass Periodโ).   \n7  11.  CoreCivic owns and operates detention facilities around the country, \n8  including the Otay Mesa Detention Center, a 1,492 bed detention center located in \n9  Otay Mesa, California (the โOtay Facilityโ).  CoreCivic unlawfully forces, coerces, \n10  and uses detainees to clean, maintain, and operate their facility.  In some instances \n11  CoreCivic  pays  detainees  $1  per  day,  and  in  other  instances  detainees  are  not \n12  compensated with wages at all, for their labor and services.  In 2016, CoreCivic \n13  reported $1.79 billion in total revenues. \n14  12.  Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief requiring CoreCivic to implement and \n15  maintain policies and practices to comply with all applicable laws and regulations \n16  designed to protect human rights, prevent and remedy these types of unlawful \n17  trafficking and forced labor practices, and protect detainees' employment rights, \n18  well-being  and  safety,  as  well  as  restitution,  damages,  statutory  remedies, \n19  disgorgement, and other further relief this Court may deem proper. \n20  13.  Plaintiffs also seek to recover, inter alia, on their own behalf and on \n21  behalf of all others similarly situated, the difference between the fair value of the \n22  labor  or  work they  performed  and  what  they  were  paid  (i.e.,  the  $1  per  day).  \n23  CoreCivic violated federal law prohibiting forced labor when CoreCivic forced, \n24  coerced, and used Plaintiffs and others to work for no pay, cleaning the โpodsโ where \n25  they  were  housed,  and  cleaning,  maintaining,  and  operating  other  areas  of  the \n26  CoreCivic detention facilities under threat of punishment, including lockdown and \n27  solitary confinement.  \n28 \n  - 3 - \n \nSylvester Owino, et al. v. CoreCivic, Inc.  \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 1   Filed 05/31/17   PageID.5   Page 5 of 36\n \n1  14.  Plaintiffs were engaged, suffered, and permitted to work by CoreCivic \n2  at, without limitation, the Otay Facility.  CoreCivic controlled the wages, hours, and \n3  working conditions of Plaintiffs.  In the course of their labor and employment by \n4  CoreCivic, Plaintiffs and other putative class members, without limitation:   \n5  a.  scrubbed bathrooms, showers, toilets, and windows;  \n6  b.  cleaned and maintained CoreCivicโs on-site medical facility;  \n7  c.  cleaned the medical facilityโs toilets, floors, and windows;  \n8  d.  cleaned patient rooms and medical staff offices;  \n9  e.  swept, mopped, stripped, and waxed the floors of the medical facility;  \n10  f.  washed medical facility laundry;  \n11  g.  swept, mopped, stripped, and waxed floors throughout the facility;  \n12  h.  washed detainee laundry;  \n13  i.  prepared and served detainee meals;  \n14  j.  assisted in preparing catered meals for law enforcement events sponsored \n15  by CoreCivic;  \n16  k.  performed clerical work for CoreCivic;   \n17  l.  prepared clothing for newly arriving detainees;  \n18  m. provided barber services to detainees;  \n19  n.  ran and managed the law library;  \n20  o.  cleaned intake areas and solitary confinement unit;  \n21  p.  cleaned and prepared vacant portions of the facility for newly arriving \n22  detainees;   \n23  q.  cleaned the facilityโs warehouse; and   \n24  r.  maintained the exterior and landscaping of the CoreCivic buildings. \n25  15.  Detainees who \"volunteered\" for such work were paid $1 per day.  The \n26  foregoing labor and services for which detainees were paid $1 per day are referred \n27  to herein as the \"Dollar-A-Day Work.\"  In addition, Plaintiffs and detainees are/were \n28 \n  - 4 - \n \nSylvester Owino, et al. v.

In addition to the Dollar-A-Day Work, CoreCivic forced and coerced \n5  Plaintiffs and members of the putative class, to clean, maintain, scrub, sweep, and \n6  mop floors, bathrooms, showers, toilets, and windows for no pay at all, not only in \n7  their living areas (\"pods\"), but also throughout the other interior and exterior areas \n8  of CoreCivicโs detention facilities by threatening to punish not only those who \n9  refused to work, but also other detainees in the pods with confinement, physical \n10  restraint, substantial and sustained restriction, deprivation, and violation of their \n11  liberty, and solitary confinement, all with the intent to obtain forced labor or services \n12  and as punishment for any refusal to work causing Plaintiffs severe mental pain and \n13  suffering.   The foregoing forced and coerced labor and services under threat of \n14  punishment, confinement, physical restraint, and deprivation of liberty for which \n15  Detainees were paid nothing at all are referred to herein as the \"Forced Labor.\" \n16  17.  Defendant paid Plaintiffs and all its other civil immigration detainee-\n17  employees one dollar ($1) per day for Dollar-A-Day Work and nothing at all for \n18  their  Forced  Labor  and  acted  with  malice,  oppression,  fraud,  and  duress  in \n19  committing the foregoing acts.  As a result of Defendantโs violations of the law, \n20  CoreCivic was unjustly enriched. \n21  Federal and State Trafficking Victims Protection Acts \n22  18.  As a result of the foregoing, Defendant violated federal law prohibiting \n23  forced labor. 18 U.S.C. ยง 1589.  In addition, Defendant violated California law \n24  prohibit human trafficking and forced labor.  Civ. Code ยง 52.5.  Plaintiffs seek actual \n25  damages,  compensatory  damages,  punitive  damages,  treble  damages,  injunctive \n26  relief, and mandatory restitution on their own behalf and on behalf of all Defendantโs \n27  other similarly situated detainees, as well as attorneysโ fees and costs, pursuant to \n28  18 U.S.C. ยงยง 1593 and 1595 and Cal. Civ. Code ยง 52.5(a).  Plaintiffs also seeks the \n  - 5 - \n \nSylvester Owino, et al. v. CoreCivic, Inc.  \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 1   Filed 05/31/17   PageID.7   Page 7 of 36\n \n1  greater of treble damages or ten thousand ($10,000) pursuant to Cal. Civ. Code ยง \n2  52.5(b). \n3  19.  Plaintiffs  and  the  putative  class  members  have  suffered,  and  are \n4  continuing  to  suffer,  real-world,  actual,  concrete  harm  by,  without  limitation, \n5  Defendant's use of Forced Labor and human trafficking, violations of applicable \n6  labor laws and orders, unfair and unlawful business practices, and negligence.  The \n7  putative class members are presently facing the same imminent real, actual, and \n8  concrete harm and injury from CoreCivicโs illegal conduct and its failure to redress \n9  the harm.  \n10  20.  The total number of civil immigration detainees who were subjected to \n11  Defendant's Forced Labor and human trafficking practices, and Defendant's illegal \n12  Dollar-A-Day Work practices is currently unknown, but these illegal practices appear \n13  endemic to the Core-Civic operations on a California-wide, and indeed a nationwide, \n14  scale. However, Core-Civic can provide the information regarding how many civil \n15  immigration detainees were subjected to these illegal practices through its solitary \n16  confinement and detention logs and also through its business records. \n17  21.  CoreCivic has been wrongly and unjustly enriched by its use of Forced \n18  Labor  and  human  trafficking  practices,  Dollar-A-Day  Work  practices,  unlawful \n19  business practices, and the retention of such revenues and profits resulting therefrom \n20  is grossly unfair.  CoreCivic should not be allowed to retain the revenues, proceeds, \n21  profits  and  other  benefits  conferred  upon  it  by  Plaintiffs  and  the  putative  class \n22  members.   \n23  22.  Defendantโs  unlawful  conduct  complained  of  herein  constitutes  a \n24  continuing  pattern  and  course  of  conduct  as  opposed  to  unrelated  discrete  acts.  \n25  Defendantโs pattern and course of conduct has continued from November 2, 2004 until \n26  the present and is a continuing violation since that date.  Neither Plaintiffs nor the Class \n27  Members were/are aware of or discovered their legal rights or claims, or could have \n28  discovered with any amount of reasonable diligence, the true facts regarding their \n  - 6 - \n \nSylvester Owino, et al. v. CoreCivic, Inc.  \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 1   Filed 05/31/17   PageID.8   Page 8 of 36\n \n1  claims until the present.  Plaintiffs and the Class Members were/are ignorant of the true \n2  facts regarding Defendantโs unlawful and illegal acts, and lacked the ability to have \n3  earlier discovered the true facts, until the present due to false statements made by \n4  Defendant  regarding  the  legality  of  their  False  Labor  and  Dollar-A-Day  Work \n5  practices.  Discovery of the true facts did not actually occur, and could not have \n6  occurred, until after any applicable statutes of limitations. \n7  The For-Profit Detention Industry \n8  23.  Throughout  the  country,  undocumented  individuals  lacking  legal \n9  permission to enter or remain in the United States are typically brought to a detention \n10  facility and placed in removal proceedings in front of an immigration judge. These \n11  individuals may include refugees seeking asylum. Individuals detained at the border \n12  are  only  released  on  a  case-by-case  basis  by  the  authority  of  U.S.  Bureau  of \n13  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (โICEโ) officials. \n14  24.  ICE uses a combination of publicly and privately owned and operated \n15  facilities to detain immigrants. Those in detention include immigrants in the country \n16  illegally, asylum seekers, green card holders, and those awaiting immigration hearings \n17  (referred to herein as a โdetaineeโ or civil immigration detaineeโ).  Nine (9) of the \n18  countryโs ten (10) largest immigration detention facilities are operated by private \n19  companies like CoreCivic, and they hold about two-thirds of the civil immigration \n20  detainees in a system that currently keeps more than 31,000 people in custody on a \n21  typical day.    \n22  25.  The for-profit civil immigration detention business is worth over $3 \n23  billion dollars a year.  While some centers are located in border areas, others are far \n24  from the border because deportation officers arrest migrants living in the interior of the \n25  country as well.  Although they have denied lobbying, private prison corporations \n26  such as Core-Civic specifically target legislators over immigration \"reform.\" The \n27  companies' success in lobbying for immigrant detention has been so successful that \n28  by 2015, CoreCivic derived 51% of its revenue from federal contracts. \n  - 7 - \n \nSylvester Owino, et al. v. CoreCivic, Inc.  \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 1   Filed 05/31/17   PageID.9   Page 9 of 36\n \n1  26.  In  March  of  2017  it  was  announced  that  the  United  States'  civil \n2  immigrant detention capacity would be increased by over four-hundred fifty per cent \n3  (450%). This signals the largest increase in immigrant detention since World War II \n4  and is, in essence, a \"get into jail and work for free card\" from which Defendant \n5  derives nearly $1 billion dollars a year in revenue. \n6  PLAINTIFFโS EXPERIENCE \n7  27.  Plaintiff Sylvester Owino is a resident of the county San Diego, in the \n8  State of California.  Mr. Owino was a detainee at CoreCivic's Otay Facility from \n9  November 7, 2005 through March 9, 2015.  During the Class Period, Mr. Owino \n10  performed Dollar-A-Day Work for $1 per day in an unsafe work environment and \n11  was forced and coerced to perform Forced Labor at, without limitation, the Otay \n12  Facility. \n13  28.  Plaintiff Owino was employed by CoreCivic to provide labor and \n14  services in an unsafe working environment cleaning and maintaining CoreCivic's \n15  on-site medical facility without personal protective equipment (\"PPE\").  PPE is \n16  special equipment worn to create a barrier between health care workers and germs. \n17  This barrier reduces the chance of touching, being exposed to, and spreading germs \n18  and helps protect people from infections caused by contact with blood or other \n19  bodily fluids. \n20  29.  Plaintiff Jonathan Gomez is a resident of San Diego, California and the \n21  county of San Diego who formerly was a detainee at the Otay Facility from June 14, \n22  2012 through September 18, 2013.

Plaintiffs satisfy the numerosity, commonality, typicality, adequacy, \n4  and predominance prerequisites for suing as representative parties pursuant to Rule \n5  23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n6  34.  Numerosity.    The  exact  number  of  proposed  Class  Members  is \n7  currently not known, but is believed to consist of thousands if not tens of thousands \n8  of former or current CoreCivic detainees who have been forced and/or coerced to \n9  work, whether for one dollar ($1) per day or no pay whatsoever, making joinder of \n10  each individual Class Member impracticable. \n11  35.  Commonality.    Common  questions  of  law  and  fact  exist  for  the \n12  proposed Classโ claims and predominate over questions affecting only individual \n13  Class Members.  Common questions include, without limitation: \n14  a.  whether Plaintiffs and the Class Members were entitled to the protections \n15  of the California labor laws and California Industrial Welfare Commission \n16  wage orders; \n17  b.  whether Plaintiffs and the Class Members performed compensable work; \n18  c.  whether Plaintiffs and the Class Members were paid $1 per day for their \n19  labor;  \n20  d.  whether forcing and coercing Plaintiffs and the Class Members to perform \n21  Forced Labor constitutes a violation of each Class Memberโs TVPA and \n22  CTVPA,  human  rights,  California  labor  law  and  California  Industrial \n23  Welfare Commission wage orders, and other statutory and common law \n24  rights as set forth herein; \n25  e.  what monitoring, limiting, and supervisory procedures and practices should \n26  CoreCivic be required to implement to ensure ongoing protection of each \n27  Class Memberโs TVPA, CTVPA, California labor law, and other legal rights \n28 \n  - 10 - \n \nSylvester Owino, et al. v.

Typicality.  Plaintiffsโ claims are typical of the claims of the proposed  \n15  Class because, among other things, Plaintiffs and Class Members legal claims all \n16  arise  from  CoreCivicโs  unlawful  practices,  and  Plaintiffs  and  Class  members \n17  sustained similar injuries and statutory damages as a result of CoreCivicโs uniform \n18  illegal conduct.  \n19  37.   Adequacy.  Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of \n20  the Class.  Their interests do not conflict with Class Membersโ interests and they \n21  have  retained  counsel  competent  and  experienced  in  complex  and  class  action \n22  litigation to vigorously prosecute this action on behalf of the Class.  In addition to \n23  satisfying the prerequisites of FRCP 23(a), Plaintiffs satisfy the requirements for \n24  maintaining a class action under FRCP 23(b)(2) and (3).  \n25  38.  Common questions of law and fact predominate over any questions \n26  affecting only individual Class Members and a Class action is superior to individual \n27  litigation because:  \n28 \n  - 11 - \n \nSylvester Owino, et al. v.

In  addition,  Class  certification  is  appropriate  under  FRCP  Rule \n11  23(b)(1) or (b)(2) because: \n12  a.  the  prosecution  of  separate  actions  by  the  individual  Members  of  the \n13  proposed Class would create a risk of inconsistent or varying adjudication \n14  which would establish incompatible standards of conduct for CoreCivic; \n15  b.  the prosecution of separate actions by individual Class Members would create \n16  a risk of adjudications with respect to them which would, as a practical matter, \n17  be dispositive of the interests of other Class Members not parties to the \n18  adjudications, or substantially impair or impede their ability to protect their \n19  interests; and \n20  c.  CoreCivic has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the \n21  proposed Class, thereby making final injunctive relief or declaratory relief \n22  described herein appropriate with respect to the proposed Class as a whole. \n23  FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n24  Violation of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act \n25  18 U.S.C. ยงยง 1589, et seq. \n26  (On Behalf of the Plaintiffs Individually and the Class) \n27  40.

Plaintiffs  and  Class  Members  were  forced,  coerced,  and  made  to \n11  perform labor and services, including Forced Labor, for CoreCivic by means of:  \n12  a.  force, threats of force, physical restraint and threats of physical restraint; \n13  b.  serious harm and threats of serious harm; and  \n14  c.  abuse and threatened abuse of law or legal process to Plaintiffs and the \n15  Class Members, and by means of a scheme, plan, pattern, and uniform \n16  policy intended to cause Plaintiffs and the Class to believe that, if they did \n17  not perform such labor or services, that they would suffer serious harm \n18  and/or physical restraint.   \n19  CoreCivic was unjustly enriched by the unlawful practice of forcing and coercing \n20  Plaintiffs and the Class Members to perform uncompensated Forced Labor through \n21  human trafficking.  By exploiting these unlawful practices CoreCivic materially and \n22  significantly reduced its labor costs and expenses, in addition to increasing its \n23  profits. \n24  43.  Plaintiffs and the Class Members are victims of Forced Labor under \n25  18 U.S.C. ยง 1589.

Labor Code ยงยง 204, 510 and 1194 and Wage \n2  Orders 5-2001, 15-2001. \n3  79.  As a result of CoreCivic's unlawful acts, Plaintiffs and Class Members \n4  have been deprived of overtime compensation in an amount to be determined at trial, \n5  and are entitled to recovery of such amounts, plus interest thereon, attorneys' fees \n6  and costs, under Cal. Labor Code ยง 1194. \n7  SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n8  Failure to Provide Mandated Meal Periods \n9  Cal. Labor Code ยงยง 226.7, 512, and I.W.C. Wage Orders 5-2001, 15-2001  \n10  (On behalf of Plaintiffs Individually and the California Labor Law Class) \n11  80.  Plaintiffs and Class Members incorporate the above allegations by \n12  reference. \n13  81.  CoreCivic failed to maintain a policy of providing meal breaks as \n14  required by Cal. Labor Code ยงยง 226.7, 512 and Wage Orders 5-2001, 15-2001. \n15  82.  Since at least three years prior to the filing of this action, Plaintiffs and \n16  Class Members have worked in excess of five hours and at times ten hours a day \n17  without being provided at least half hour meal periods in which they were relieved of \n18  their duties, as required by Cal.

Plaintiffs and Class Members incorporate the above allegations by \n9  reference. \n10  85.  Since at least three years prior to the commencement of this action. \n11  Plaintiffs and Class Members have regularly worked without any rest periods that \n12  are required by Wage Orders 5-2001, 15-2001.

Because CoreCivic failed to provide proper rest periods, it is liable to \n17  Plaintiffs and Class Members for one (1) hour of additional pay at the regular rate of \n18  compensation for each workday that the proper rest periods were not provided, \n19  pursuant to Cal.

California  Labor  Code  ยง  226  requires  an  employer  to  furnish  its \n2  employees with an accurate itemized statement in writing showing, among other things:  \n3  a.  all applicable hourly rates in effect during each respective pay period and the \n4  corresponding number of hours worked by each respective individual;  \n5  b.  total hours worked by each respective individual;  \nc.  gross wages earned;  \n6 \nd.  net wages earned;  \n7 \ne.  all deductions;  \n8 \nf.  inclusive dates of the period for which the employee is paid;  \n9 \ng.  the name of the employee and an employee identification or social security \n10 \nnumber; and  \n11 \nh.  the name and address of the legal entity that is the employer. \n12 \n13  89.  As  a  pattern  and  practice,  in  violation  of  Labor  Code  ยง  226(a), \n14  CoreCivic did not provide Plaintiffs or Class Members with accurate itemized wage \n15  statements in writing showing:  \na.  all applicable hourly rates in effect during each respective pay period and \n16 \nthe corresponding number of hours worked by each respective individual;  \n17 \nb.  number of hours worked;  \n18 \nc.  gross wages earned;  \n19 \nd.  net wages earned;  \n20 \ne.  all deductions;  \n21 \nf.  inclusive dates of the period for which the employee is paid;  \n22 \ng.  the employee identification or social security number; and  \n23 \nh.  the address of the legal entity that is the employer. \n24 \n25  90.

CoreCivic has knowingly and intentionally failed to comply with Cal. \n4  Labor Code ยง 226(a) and failed to provide a wage statement to Plaintiffs and Class \n5  Members. \n6  92.  Pursuant  to  Cal.

Labor Code ยง 432.5 \n6  (On behalf of Plaintiffs Individually and the California Labor Law Class) \n7  97.  Plaintiffs  and  Class  Members  incorporate  the  above  allegations  by \n8  reference. \n9  98.  Cal. Labor Code ยง 432.5 provides that no employer shall require any \n10  employee to agree, in writing, to any term or condition which is known by the \n11  employer to be prohibited by law. \n12  99.  CoreCivic requires, as a condition of employment, that Plaintiffs and \n13  Class Members sign a written agreement which includes numerous terms that are \n14  prohibited  by  law,  including  but  not  limited  to  agreeing  to work for less than \n15  minimum wage or without appropriate overtime compensation. \n16  100.  Provisions  of  the  employment  contract,  as  described  above,  that \n17  Plaintiffs and Class Members were required to sign as a condition of employment, \n18  explicitly  and  unquestionably,  violate  several  provisions  of  California  law  and \n19  public policy. Upon information and belief, CoreCivic knew that such provisions \n20  violated California law and public policy. \n21  101.  As a result of Defendant's unlawful conduct as alleged herein, Plaintiffs \n22  and Class Members have sustained damages. \n23  ELEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n24  Negligence \n25  (On Behalf of Plaintiffs Individually and the Class) \n26  102.  Plaintiffs and the Class Members incorporate the above allegations by \n27  reference. \n28 \n  - 28 - \n \nSylvester Owino, et al. v. CoreCivic, Inc.  \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 1   Filed 05/31/17   PageID.30   Page 30 of 36\n \n1  103.  In engaging Plaintiffs and the Class members to provide labor and \n2  services to CoreCivic, CoreCivic owed a duty to exercise reasonable and ordinary \n3  care in complying with all applicable local, state, and federal laws and to furnish a \n4  safe working place for its employees.  \n5  104.  This duty included, among other things, taking reasonable measures to \n6  implement  and  maintain  reasonable  procedures  to  provide  a  safe  working \n7  environment and workplace and to protect the rights of Class Members in compliance \n8  with applicable law, including, but not limited to procedures and policies:   \n9  a.  to supervise, restrict, limit, and determine whether any Plaintiffs and the \n10  Class Members were subject to Forced Labor practices by CoreCivic or \n11  perform other labor and services under threat of punishment, confinement, \n12  physical restraint, and deprivation of liberty;  \n13  b.  to notify Plaintiffs and the Class Members of their rights under the TVPA \n14  and CTVPA; and  \n15  c.  when and how to notify Plaintiffs and the Class Members of CoreCivic's \n16  unlawful Forced Labor practices.  \n17  105.  In providing services to the Plaintiffs and the Class, CoreCivic owed \n18  them a duty to exercise reasonable care, without limitation in:  \n19  a.  adequately providing a safe working environment and workplace;  \n20  b.  adequately protecting the rights of Class Members in compliance with \n21  applicable law;  \n22  c.  prohibiting and adequately ensuring Plaintiffs and the Class Members \n23  were not subject to Forced Labor practices;  \n24  d.  adequately ensuring Plaintiffs and the Class Members had a safe work \n25  environment; and  \n26  e.  protecting the rights of Plaintiffs and the Classโ under the TVPA and \n27  CTVPA from CoreCivic's Forced Labor practices.   \n28 \n  - 29 - \n \nSylvester Owino, et al. v.

CoreCivicโ systems, policies, and procedures for adequately ensuring \n2  the rights of Plaintiffs and the Class Members under the TVPA and CTVPA were \n3  adequately  protected  were  intended  to,  and  did,  affect  Plaintiffs  and  the  Class \n4  Members.  CoreCivic was aware that by utilizing Plaintiffs' and the Class Members \n5  labor and services, it had a responsibility to take reasonable measures to protect their \n6  rights under applicable law. \n7  107.  The duty CoreCivic owed to Plaintiffs and Class Members to protect \n8  their  rights  under  applicable  law  is  underscored  by  the  Federal  and  California \n9  Trafficking Victims Protection Act, which recognizes the importance of preventing \n10  the crime of trafficking of a person for forced labor or services. \n11  108.  Additionally, CoreCivic had a duty to timely disclose to and/or warn \n12  Plaintiffs and Class Members of their rights under the TVPA, CTVPA, California \n13  labor laws, and other applicable laws, rules, and regulations.  Timely disclosure was \n14  necessary and appropriate so that Plaintiffs and Class Members could have, among \n15  other things,  timely pursued and exhausted available remedies, and undertaken \n16  appropriate measures to avoid, prevent or mitigate the violations of their rights under \n17  applicable laws. \n18  109.  There is a very close connection between CoreCivicโs failure to take \n19  reasonable measures to provide a safe and lawful work environment and timely \n20  disclosure of Plaintiffs' and the Class Members' rights and the injury to Plaintiffs and \n21  the Class.   \n22  110.  When individuals have their human and labor law rights violated they \n23  are at risk for personal, financial,  physical,  and emotional injury, distress, and \n24  damage and need to incur additional costs and expense to protect themselves and \n25  seek and obtain redress from such invasions of their legal rights. \n26  111.  CoreCivic  is  legally  responsible  for  such  unlawful  violations  of \n27  Plaintiffs and the Class Members' human and labor law rights and their right to a \n28  safe  working  environment  because  it  failed  to  take  reasonable  measures  in \n  - 30 - \n \nSylvester Owino, et al. v. CoreCivic, Inc.  \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 1   Filed 05/31/17   PageID.32   Page 32 of 36\n \n1  connection therewith.  If CoreCivic had taken reasonable measures in connection \n2  with their employment of Plaintiffs and the Class Members, their legal rights would \n3  not have been violated. \n4  112.  The policy of preventing future harm weighs in favor of finding a \n5  special relationship between CoreCivic and the Class. CoreCivicโs civil immigration \n6  detainees  have  no  choice  to  but  to  perform  the  Forced  Labor  when  and  how \n7  CoreCivic demands it.  If CoreCivic is not held accountable for failing to take \n8  reasonable measures to protect the human rights and labor law rights of its detainees, \n9  they will not take the steps that are necessary to protect against future invasions of \n10  such rights. \n11  113.  It was foreseeable that if CoreCivic did not take reasonable measures, \n12  the human rights and labor law rights of Plaintiffs and Members of the Class would \n13  be violated. CoreCivic should have known to take precautions to prevent such \n14  abuses. \n15  114.  CoreCivic breached its duty to exercise reasonable care in providing a \n16  safe work environment for, and protecting the human rights and labor law rights of, \n17  Plaintiffs and the Class Members by, without limitation:   \n18  a.  failing  to  implement  and  maintain  adequate  measures  to  safeguard \n19  detainees' rights;  \n20  b.  failing to monitor its operations to identify unlawful activity;  \n21  c.  requiring and/or allowing Plaintiffs and the Class to work in an unsafe \n22  environment; and  \n23  d.  failing to otherwise prevent human rights and labor law abuses. \n24  115.  CoreCivic breached its duty to timely warn or notify Plaintiffs and the \n25  Class about its unlawful Forced Labor and โDollar-A-Day Workโ practices and \n26  programs.  CoreCivic has failed to issue any warnings to its current and former \n27  detainees affected by these unlawful practices.  Additionally, CoreCivic was, or \n28  should have been, aware of its unlawful practices as early as November 2, 2004. \n  - 31 - \n \nSylvester Owino, et al. v.

But  for  CoreCivicโs  failure  to  implement  and  maintain  adequate \n2  measures to provide a safe working environment for, and protect the human rights \n3  and labor law rights of, Plaintiffs and the Class Members, and its failure to monitor \n4  its operations to identify unlawful Forced Labor and Dollar-A-Day Work violations \n5  of the labor laws, Plaintiffs' and Class Members' rights would not have been violated \n6  and Class Members would not be at a heightened risk of unlawful Forced Labor and \n7  other labor law violations in the future. \n8  117.  CoreCivicโs negligence was a substantial factor in causing harm to \n9  Plaintiffs and Class Members, and in violating their human rights and labor law \n10  rights.  As a direct and proximate cause and result of CoreCivicโ failure to exercise \n11  reasonable care and use reasonable measures to provide a safe working environment \n12  and safeguard the human rights and labor law rights of Plaintiffs and the Class \n13  Members, Plaintiffs and the Class Members were subjected to Forced Labor and the \n14  labor law violations set forth herein. Class Members face a heightened risk of such \n15  unlawful practices in the future. \n16  118.  Neither Plaintiffs nor other Class Members contributed to the unlawful \n17  conduct set forth herein, nor did they contribute to CoreCivicโs unlawful Forced \n18  Labor practices and other labor law violations, nor to the insufficient measures to \n19  provide a safe working environment and to safeguard the human rights and labor law \n20  rights of Plaintiffs and the Class Members. \n21  119.  Plaintiffs and the Class Members seek compensatory damages and \n22  exemplary damages with pre-and-post judgment interest, the costs of suit, attorneysโ \n23  fees, and other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper. \n24  TWELFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n25  Unjust Enrichment \n26  (On Behalf of Plaintiffs Individually and the Class) \n27  120.  Plaintiffs and the Class Members incorporate the above allegations by \n28  reference.\n\t\n  - 32 - \n \nSylvester Owino, et al. v.

App. 4th 648, 661 (2011) (โCommon law principles of restitution require a party \n6  to return a benefit when the retention of such benefit would unjustly enrich the \n7  recipient; a typical cause of action involving such remedy is โquasi-contract.โ) \n8  122.  โWhen a plaintiff alleges unjust enrichment, a court may construe the \n9  cause  of  action  as  a  quasi-contract  claim  seeking  restitution.โ  Astiana  v.  Hain \n10  Celestial Grp., Inc., 783 F.3d 753, 762 (9th Cir. 2015). โWhether termed unjust \n11  enrichment, quasi-contract, or quantum meruit, the equitable remedy of restitution \n12  when unjust enrichment has occurred โis an obligation (not a true contract [citation]) \n13  created by the law without regard to the intention of the parties, and is designed to \n14  restore the aggrieved party to his or her former position by return of the thing or its \n15  equivalent in money.โ F.D.I.C. v. Dintino, 167 Cal. App. 4th 333, 346 (2008). \n16  123.  Plaintiffs and Class Members conferred non-gratuitous benefits upon \n17  CoreCivic by performing โDollar-A-Day Workโ for all hours worked for which \n18  CoreCivic would otherwise have had to pay at least the applicable minimum wage \n19  or more, thereby significantly and materially increasing CoreCivic's profit margins, \n20  and unjustly enriching CoreCivic at the expense of and to the detriment of Plaintiffs \n21  and the Class Members. \n22  124.  CoreCivicโs retention of any benefit collected directly and indirectly \n23  from Plaintiffsโ and Class Members' labor and services violated principles of justice, \n24  equity, and good conscience. As a result, CoreCivic has been unjustly enriched.  \n25  Plaintiffs and Class Members are entitled to recover from CoreCivic all amounts that \n26  CoreCivic  has  wrongfully  and  improperly  obtained,  and  CoreCivic  should  be \n27  required to disgorge to Plaintiffs and Class Members the benefits it has unjustly \n28  obtained.   \n  - 33 - \n \nSylvester Owino, et al. v.

CoreCivic  accepted or retained such benefits with knowledge that \n2  Plaintiffs' and Class Members' human rights and labor law right were being violated \n3  for financial gain.  CoreCivic has been unjustly enriched in retaining the revenues \n4  and profits from Plaintiffs and Class Membersโ Dollar-A-Day Work, which retention \n5  under these circumstances is unjust and inequitable. \n6  126.  As a direct and proximate result of CoreCivicโs Forced Labor practices \n7  and the Dollar-A-Day Work program, Plaintiffs and Class Members have suffered \n8  concrete harm and injury, including, but not limited to, physical and emotional \n9  injury, monetary loss in connection with their labor and services provided CoreCivic \n10  purchases of services, and the unlawful violation of their human rights and labor law \n11  rights, as alleged herein. \n12  127.  CoreCivicโs retention of the non-gratuitous benefits conferred on them \n13  by Plaintiffs and Class Members would be unjust and inequitable. Plaintiffs and Class \n14  Members  are  entitled  to  seek  disgorgement  and  restitution  of  wrongful  profits, \n15  revenue, and benefits conferred upon CoreCivic in a manner established by this Court. \n16  128.

CORE CIVIC, INC.    3 \nconvicted of, any crime, alleged that the overseers of their \nprivate detention facilities forced them to perform labor \nagainst their will and without adequate compensation in \nviolation  of  the  Victims  of  Trafficking  and  Violence \nProtection Act of 2000, the California Trafficking Victims \nProtection Act (โCalifornia TVPAโ), various provisions of \nthe California Labor Code, and other state laws.   \nThe panel held that the district court properly exercised \nits discretion in certifying a California Labor Law Class, a \nCalifornia Forced Labor Class, and a National Forced Labor \nClass.   \nThe panel held that, as to the California Forced Labor \nClass, plaintiffs submitted sufficient proof of a classwide \npolicy of forced labor to establish commonality.  Plaintiffs \nestablished predominance because the claims of the class \nmembers all depended on common questions of law and \nfact.  The panel agreed with the district court that narrowing \nthe California Forced Labor Class based on the California \nTVPAโs statute of limitations was not required at the class \ncertification stage. \nFor the same reasons as above, the panel held that, as to \nthe National Forced Labor Class, the district court did not \nabuse its discretion in concluding that plaintiffs presented \nsignificant proof of a classwide policy of forced labor and \nthat  common  questions  predominated  over  individual \nones.  The panel held that under Moser v. Benefytt, Inc., 8 \nF.4th 872 (9th Cir. 2021), CoreCivicโs personal jurisdiction \nchallenge with respect to the claim of non-California-facility \nclass  members  was  an  issue  for  the  district  court  to \nresolve.  The panel declined to vacate the certification of the \nNational Forced Labor Class, but it held that CoreCivic \nretained  its  personal  jurisdiction  defense,  and  the  panel \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 249   Filed 12/20/22   PageID.9274   Page 4 of 498\n4  OWINO V. CORECIVIC, INC. \nremanded the personal jurisdiction question to the district \ncourt for consideration at the appropriate time. \nAs to the California Labor Law Class, the panel held that \nplaintiffs  established  that  damages  were  capable  of \nmeasurement on a classwide basis, and they did not need to \npresent a fully formed damages model when discovery was \nnot yet complete.  The panel agreed with the district court \nthat the named plaintiffs were typical of the class they sought \nto  represent  and  their  allegations,  if  true,  fit  within \nCaliforniaโs Unfair Competition Law and the state labor law \nprovisions  they  invoked.   Narrowing  the  class  based  on \nstatute of limitations was not required at the certification \nstage.  The panel held that the district court did not abuse its \ndiscretion in certifying a failure-to-pay and waiting-time \nclaim,  which  was  affirmatively  interwoven  in  plaintiffsโ \npleadings. \nJudge VanDyke, joined by Judges Callahan, Bennett, R. \nNelson, and Bumatay, and by Judge Ikuta except as to Part \nII-A, dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc.  In Part \nII-A, Judge VanDyke wrote that the panel created inter- and \nintra-circuit conflicts by eliminating the actual causation \nrequirement for โforced laborโ claims under the TVPA.  In \nPart II-B, Judge VanDyke wrote that rehearing en banc also \nwas warranted because the panel transgressed the holding of \nWal-Mart  Stores  v.  Dukes,  564  U.S.  338  (2011), \ndisregarding Fed. R. Civ. P. 23โs commonality requirement \nby concluding that a handful of declarations from detainees \nat only one of the defendantโs 24 facilities was significant \nproof of the defendantโs nationwide policies and practices. \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 249   Filed 12/20/22   PageID.9275   Page 5 of 498\n  OWINO V.

CORECIVIC, INC. \nOPINION \n \nMcKEOWN, Circuit Judge: \nThis appeal arises from a class action filed by individuals \nwho  were  incarcerated  in  private  immigration  detention \nfacilities owned and operated by a for-profit corporation, \nCoreCivic, Inc.  These individualsโdetained solely due to \ntheir  immigration  status  and  neither  charged  with,  nor \nconvicted of, any crimeโallege that the overseers of their \nprivate detention facilities forced them to perform labor \nagainst their will and without adequate compensation.  Our \ninquiry on appeal concerns only whether the district court \nproperly certified three classes of detainees.  Considering the \nsignificant  deference  we  owe  to  the  district  court  when \nreviewing a class certification, as well as the district courtโs \nextensive and reasoned findings, we affirm the certification \nof all three classes. \nBACKGROUND \nIn  2017,  Sylvester  Owino  (โOwinoโ)  and  Jonathan \nGomez (โGomezโ) (collectively โOwinoโ) brought a class \naction suit against CoreCivic.  Both men were previously \nheld in a civil immigration detention facility operated by \nCoreCivicโOwino from 2005 to 2015, and Gomez from \n2012  to  2013.    They  filed  suit  โon  behalf  of  all  civil \nimmigration detainees who were incarcerated and forced to \nwork  by  CoreCivic,โ  seeking  declaratory  and  injunctive \nrelief  and  damages,  among  other  remedies,  for \nโforcing/coercing detainees to clean, maintain, and operate \nCoreCivicโs detention facilities in violation of both federal \nand state human trafficking and labor laws.โ  Specifically, \nOwino alleged violations of the Victims of Trafficking and \nViolence Protection Act of 2000, 18 U.S.C. ยง 1589 et seq. \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 249   Filed 12/20/22   PageID.9277   Page 7 of 498\n  OWINO V. CORE CIVIC, INC.    7 \n(โTVPAโ), California Trafficking Victims Protection Act, \nCal. Civ. Code ยง 52.5 (โCTVPAโ), various provisions of the \nCalifornia Labor Code, and other state laws. \nPursuant to 8 U.S.C. ยง 1231(g), U.S. Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement (โICEโ) contracts with CoreCivic to \nincarcerate detained immigrants in 24 facilities across 11 \nstates.  According to Owino, those incarcerated in these \nfacilities โare detained based solely on their immigration \nstatus and have not been charged with a crime.โ  Because of \nthis, ICE states these detainees โshall not be required to \nwork,  except  to  do  personal  housekeeping.โ    These \nhousekeeping duties are delineated in ICEโs Performance-\nBased  National  Detention  Standards  (โStandardsโ):  โ1. \nmaking their bunk beds daily; 2. stacking loose papers; 3. \nkeeping the floor free of debris and dividers free of clutter; \nand 4. refraining from hanging/draping clothing, pictures, \nkeepsakes, or other objects from beds, overhead lighting \nfixtures or other furniture.โ  Performance-Based National \nDetention  Standards  2011,  at  406  (revised  Dec.  2016), \nhttps://www.ice.gov/doclib/detention-standards/2011/pbnds\n2011r2016.pdf.    The  Standards  also  require  facilities  to \nprovide detainees with the โopportunity to participate in a \nvoluntary work programโ (โWork Programโ) for which they \nmust be compensated at least $1 per day.  Id. at 406, 407. \nDespite these guidelines, Owino contends that, โas a \nmatter of policy,โ CoreCivic compelled him and detainees \nacross its facilities to work โas a virtually free labor force to \ncomplete โessentialโ work duties at their facilities,โ including \nsuch โfoundational tasksโ as kitchen and laundry services.  \nCoreCivicโs  written  policies  require  โallโ  detainees  to \nโmaintain[] the common living area [i.e., not the bunk bed \narea] in a clean and sanitary manner.โ  The policies further \nrequire โ[d]etainee/inmate workersโ to carry out a โdaily \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 249   Filed 12/20/22   PageID.9278   Page 8 of 498\n8  OWINO V.

Owino further contends that CoreCivic \npaid ICE detainees between $.75 and $1.50 per day for work \nthat it โmisclassifiedโ as โvolunteer,โ thus failing to pay \nwages that approximated the minimum hourly wage required \nby California law. \nOn  April  15,  2019,  Owino  filed  a  motion  for  class \ncertification, seeking to certify five classes: \n1.  California  Labor  Law  Class:  All  ICE \ndetainees  who  (i)  were  detained  at  a  CoreCivic \nfacility located in California between May 31, 2013, \nand the present, and (ii) worked through CoreCivicโs \nVoluntary  Work  Program  during  their  period  of \ndetention in California. \n2.

California Basic Necessities Class: All ICE \ndetainees  who  (i)  were  detained  at  a  CoreCivic \nfacility  located  in  California  between  January  1, \n2006,  and  the  present,  (ii)  worked  through \nCoreCivicโs Work Program, and (iii) purchased basic \nliving necessities through CoreCivicโs commissary \nduring their period of detention in California. \n5.  National Basic Necessities Class: All ICE \ndetainees  who  (i)  were  detained  at  a  CoreCivic \nfacility between December 23, 2008, and the present, \n(ii) worked through CoreCivicโs Work Program, and \n(iii)  purchased  basic  living  necessities  through \nCoreCivicโs  commissary  during  their  period  of \ndetention. \nA  year  laterโfollowing  numerous  filings,  oral \nargument,  and  supplemental  briefingโthe  district  court \ncertified three of the proposed five classes: (1) the California \nLabor Law Class, (2) the California Forced Labor Class, and \n(3) the National Forced Labor Class.  In an extensive and \nthoughtful order, the district court found the following: \n1.  California  Labor  Law  Class:  Owino  and \nGomez โadequately have established that they were \nnever  paid  a  minimum  wage  through  the  [Work \nProgram],โ  that  they  โnever  received  wage \nstatements,โ  and  that  CoreCivic  โfailed  to  pay \ncompensation  upon  terminationโ  and  โimposed \nunlawful  terms  and  conditions  of  employment.โ  \nThere  were  sufficient  โcommon,  predominating \nquestionsโ to certify the class. \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 249   Filed 12/20/22   PageID.9280   Page 10 of 498\n10  OWINO V. CORECIVIC, INC. \n2.  California Forced Labor Class: Owino and \nGomez  โsufficiently  have  demonstratedโ  that \nCoreCivic  facilities  in  California  โimplemented \ncommon  sanitation  and  disciplinary  policies  that \ntogether may have coerced detainees to clean areas \nof  [CoreCivicโs  California]  facilities  beyond  the \npersonal housekeeping tasks enumerated in the ICE \n[Standards].โ \n \n3.  National  Forced  Labor  Class:  Owino  and \nGomez โsufficiently have demonstratedโ the same \nregarding CoreCivic facilities nationwide. \nDue to the vulnerability of the class members and the \nโrisks,  small  recovery,  and  relatively  high  costs  of \nlitigation,โ  the  district  court  concluded  that  โclass-wide \nlitigation is superiorโ because โno viable alternative method \nof adjudication exists.โ \nANALYSIS \nWe  review  the  district  courtโs  class  certification  for \nโabuse of discretion.โ  B.K. ex rel. Tinsley v. Snyder, 922 \nF.3d 957, 965 (9th Cir. 2019).  As we set out at length in \nSnyder, \nAn error of law is a per se abuse of discretion.  \nAccordingly,  we  first  review  a  class \ncertification  determination  for  legal  error \nunder a de novo standard, and if no legal error \noccurred,  we  will  proceed  to  review  the \ndecision for abuse of discretion.  A district \ncourt  applying  the  correct  legal  standard \nabuses its discretion only if it (1) relies on an \nimproper  factor,  (2)  omits  a  substantial \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 249   Filed 12/20/22   PageID.9281   Page 11 of 498\n  OWINO V. CORE CIVIC, INC.    11 \nfactor,  or  (3)  commits  a  clear  error  of \njudgment  in  weighing  the  correct  mix  of \nfactors.  Additionally, we review the district \ncourtโs  findings  of  fact  under  the  clearly \nerroneous standard, meaning we will reverse \nthem  only  if  they  are  (1)  illogical,  (2) \nimplausible,  or  (3)  without  support  in \ninferences  that  may  be  drawn  from  the \nrecord. \nId. at 965โ66 (quoting Sali v. Corona Regโl Med. Ctr., 909 \nF.3d 996, 1002 (9th Cir. 2018)).  Notably, in โreviewing a \ngrant  of  class  certification,  we  accord  the  district  court \nnoticeably more deference than when we review a denial of \nclass certification.โ  Wolin v. Jaguar Land Rover N. Am., \nLLC, 617 F.3d 1168, 1171 (9th Cir. 2010). \nIn assessing whether to certify a class, the district court \ndetermines whether the requirements of Rule 23 are met.  \nRule 23 provides: \nOne or more members of a class may sue or \nbe sued as representative parties on behalf of \nall  members  only  if:  (1)  the  class  is  so \nnumerous  that  joinder  of  all  members  is \nimpracticable [โnumerosityโ]; (2) there are \nquestions of law or fact common to the class \n[โcommonalityโ]; (3) the claims or defenses \nof the representative parties are typical of the \nclaims or defenses of the class [โtypicalityโ]; \nand (4) the representative parties will fairly \nand adequately protect the interests of the \nclass [โadequacyโ]. \n \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  Additionally, a proposed class must \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 249   Filed 12/20/22   PageID.9282   Page 12 of 498\n12  OWINO V. CORECIVIC, INC. \nsatisfy one of the subdivisions of Rule 23(b).  Comcast Corp. \nv. Behrend, 569 U.S. 27, 33 (2013).  Owino seeks to proceed \nunder Rule 23(b)(3), which requires โthe court find[] that the \n[common  questions]  predominate  over  any  questions \naffecting only individual members [โpredominanceโ], and \nthat a class action is superior to other available methods for \nfairly  and  efficiently  adjudicating  the  controversy \n[โsuperiorityโ].โ  Fed R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  The district court \nmade both findings. \nCoreCivic brings three challenges to each of the three \ncertified classes.  We review each of these challenges in turn. \nI.  CALIFORNIA FORCED LABOR CLASS \nA.  Class-wide Policy of Forced Labor \nWe  first  consider  CoreCivicโs  assertion  that  Owino \nfailed to present โ[s]ignificant proofโ of a class-wide policy \nof forced labor, thus defeating commonality.  Wal-Mart \nStores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 353 (2011).  To support \nthe  California  Forced  Labor  class,  Owino  provided  the \ndeclarations of four detainees, all from one facility, but this \nwas not the extent or the focus of Owinoโs โsignificant \nproof,โ nor was it the focus of the district courtโs decision.  \nRather, Owino centered his argument, and the district court \ncentered its holding, on the text of CoreCivicโs corporate \npolicies.  The sanitation policy requires detainees to remove \ntrash, wash windows, sweep and mop, โthoroughlyโ scrub \ntoilet bowls, sinks, and showers, and undertake sundry other \ncleaning responsibilities across the facility.  On their face, \nthese policies appear to go beyond those minimal tidying \nresponsibilities laid out in the ICE Standards.  The discipline \npolicy further makes clear that detainees are subject to a \nrange of punishments, including disciplinary segregation, \nfor refusal to โclean assigned living areaโ or โobey a staff \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 249   Filed 12/20/22   PageID.9283   Page 13 of 498\n  OWINO V. CORE CIVIC, INC.    13 \nmember/officerโs order.โ \nThe persuasive weight of the text of these policies is \naugmented by the statements of ICE detainees themselves, \nwho  declared  that  they  were  in  fact  required  to  clean \ncommon  areasโwithout  payment  and  under  threat  of \npunishmentโin  line  with  the  policies.    Further,  one  of \nCoreCivicโs own senior managers testified that CoreCivic \nfacilities do not have the ability to opt out of these company-\nwide, โstandard policies.โ \nCommonality is necessarily established where there is a \nclass-wide policy to which all class members are subjected.  \nParsons v. Ryan, 754 F.3d 657, 678 (9th Cir. 2014).  And \nwhile โthe mere existence of a facially defective written \npolicyโwithout any evidence that it was implemented in an \nunlawful mannerโdoes not constitute โ[s]ignificant proofโ \nthat a class of employees were [sic] subject to an unlawful \npractice,โ Davidson v. OโReilly Auto Enters., LLC, 968 F.3d \n955, 968 (9th Cir. 2020) (internal citation omitted), Owino \nrelied on the written policies as well as the testimony of \nformer  ICE  detainees  and  CoreCivicโs  own  manager.  \nAlthough the company โmay wish to distance itself from [its \nemployeeโs]  statements,โ  here  the  โadmissions  were \nmaterial and [are] properly before us.โ  Abdullah v. U.S. Sec. \nAssocs., 731 F.3d 952, 966 (9th Cir. 2013). \nIn view of the highly deferential abuse of discretion \nstandard and the full scope of evidence in the record, we \nreject  CoreCivicโs  claim  that  Owino  failed  to  provide \nโsignificant proofโ of the class-wide policy necessary to \nsatisfy the commonality requirement. \nB.  Predominance of Common Questions \nWe next consider CoreCivicโs claim that Owino failed to \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 249   Filed 12/20/22   PageID.9284   Page 14 of 498\n14  OWINO V. CORECIVIC, INC. \nestablish  that  common  questions  predominate  over \nindividual  ones,  thus  defeating  predominance.    The \npredominance inquiry tests โwhether proposed classes are \nsufficiently  cohesive  to  warrant  adjudication  by \nrepresentation.โ  Tyson Foods, Inc. v. Bouaphakeo, 577 U.S. \n442, 453 (2016) (quoting Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, \n521 U.S. 591, 623 (1997)).  Here, they are. \nAs the district court noted, the California Forced Labor \nclass members โshare a large number of common attributes, \nincluding  that  they  are  immigrants  who  are  or  were \ninvoluntarily  detained  in  [CoreCivicโs]  facilities  and \nsubjected to common sanitation and disciplinary policies.โ  \nThe claims of these class members all depend on common \nquestions  of  law  and  factโwhether  CoreCivic  utilized \nthreats  of  discipline  to  compel  detainees  to  clean  its \nCalifornia facilities in violation of state and federal human \ntrafficking  statutes.    This  is  a  quintessential  โcommon \nquestionโ  as  defined  by  the  Supreme  Court:  โthe  same \nevidence will suffice for each member to make a prima facie \nshowing [or] the issue is susceptible to generalized, class-\nwide  proof.โ    Tyson  Foods,  577  U.S.  at  453  (citation \nomitted). \nIn other words, the question is appropriate for class-wide \nresolution  because  either  CoreCivicโs  company-wide \npolicies and practices violated the law and the rights of the \nclass members, or they didnโt.  See Parsons, 754 F.3d at 678 \n(holding  that  the  โpolicies  and  practices  to  which  all \nmembers of the class are subjected . . . are the โglueโ that \nholds together the putative class . . . either each of the \npolicies and practices is unlawful as to every inmate or it is \nnotโ); see also Gonzalez v. U.S. Immigr. & Customs Enfโt, \n975 F.3d 788, 808 (9th Cir. 2020). \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 249   Filed 12/20/22   PageID.9285   Page 15 of 498\n  OWINO V. CORE CIVIC, INC.    15 \nCoreCivic  argues  against  predominance  largely  by \nattempting to reframe the inquiry, asserting that the district \ncourt should have asked whether each class member actually \nhas a viable California TVPA claim.  However, this is not \nthe applicable test.  In Tyson Foods, the Supreme Court \ninstructs that \n[t]he predominance inquiry asks whether the \ncommon, aggregation-enabling, issues in the \ncase are more prevalent or important than \nthe non-common, aggregation-defeating, \nindividual issues.  When one or more of the \ncentral issues in the action are common to \nthe class and can be said to predominate, the \naction may be considered proper under Rule \n23(b)(3) even though other important \nmatters will have to be tried separately, such \nas damages or some affirmative defenses \npeculiar to some individual class members. \n \n577  U.S.  at  453  (internal  citations  and  quotation  marks \nomitted); see also Olean Wholesale Grocery Coop., Inc. v. \nBumble Bee Foods, 31 F.4th 651, 681โ82 (9th Cir. 2022) (en \nbanc). \nC.  Statute of Limitations \nFinally,  we  consider  CoreCivicโs  argument  that  the \ndistrict court should have narrowed the proposed California \nForced Labor class based on the statute of limitations.  While \nOwino seeks to include all ICE detainees held at a CoreCivic \nfacility  in  California  between  January  1,  2006,  and  the \npresent, CoreCivic argues that because the California TVPA \nhas a seven-year statute of limitations, no detainee who was \nreleased before May 31, 2010, can bring a claim.  See Cal. \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 249   Filed 12/20/22   PageID.9286   Page 16 of 498\n16  OWINO V. CORECIVIC, INC. \nCiv. Code ยง 52.5(c).  The district court ruled that such a \nfinding was premature at the class certification stage: โIf \ndiscovery indicates that the class period should be limited, \nthe Court will entertain a motion to that effect; however, at \nthis stage in the litigation and on the record before it, the \nCourt is not inclined to narrow the class period.โ \nWe agree with the district court that narrowing the class \nbased  on  statute  of  limitations  is  not  required  at  the \ncertification stage.  Along with our sister circuits, we have \nheld this in the context of the predominance inquiry.  See, \ne.g., Williams v. Sinclair, 529 F.2d 1383, 1388 (9th Cir. \n1975) (โThe existence of a statute of limitations issue does \nnot compel a finding that individual issues predominate over \ncommon ones.โ); see also In re Monumental Life Ins. Co., \n365  F.3d  408,  420โ21  (5th  Cir.  2004);  Waste  Mgmt. \nHoldings, Inc. v. Mowbray, 208 F.3d 288, 296 (1st Cir. \n2000).  We now clarify that this principle is applicable to \ncertification  more  broadly.    After  all,  โ[e]ven  after  a \ncertification  order  is  entered,  the  judge  remains  free  to \nmodify it in the light of subsequent developments in the \nlitigation.โ  Gen. Tel. Co. of the Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, \n160 (1982).  CoreCivic cites no case law to the contrary.  We \ntherefore  hold  that  the  district  court  did  not  abuse  its \ndiscretion in declining to narrow the California Forced Labor \nclass. \nII.  NATIONAL FORCED LABOR CLASS \nWe can dispense with CoreCivicโs first two challenges \nto the National Forced Labor class easily, as these challenges \nare virtually identical to those directed at the California \nForced Labor class.  For the same reasons discussed above, \nthe district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding \nthat Owino presented significant proof of a class-wide policy \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 249   Filed 12/20/22   PageID.9287   Page 17 of 498\n  OWINO V. CORE CIVIC, INC.    17 \nof forced labor.  Likewise, the district court did not abuse its \ndiscretion  in  concluding  that  common  questions \npredominate over individual ones.  CoreCivicโs argument \nthat  the  TVPA  necessitates  a  subjective,  individualized \ninquiry fails due to contrary language in the statute, see, e.g., \n18 U.S.C. ยง 1589(c)(2) (defining โserious harmโ as that \nwhich would compel a โreasonable personโ to perform or \ncontinue performing labor to avoid incurring such harm), as \nwell  as  the  broader  predominance  test  prescribed  by \nprecedent.  Tyson Foods, 577 U.S. at 453. \nThe  statuteโs  causal  elementโprohibiting  the \nobtainment of labor โby means ofโ one of the statutorily \nenumerated harms, see 18 U.S.C. ยง 1589(a)โmay similarly \nbe inferred by class-wide evidence.  See Menocal v. GEO \nGrp., Inc., 882 F.3d 905, 918โ20 (10th Cir. 2018); Rosas v. \nSarbanand Farms, LLC, 329 F.R.D. 671, 689 (W.D. Wash. \n2018)  (โAn  allegation  that  the  defendant  engaged  in  a \ncommon scheme or practice to coerce labor from putative \nclass members may be sufficient to establish that the classโs \nclaim is susceptible to class-wide resolution.โ).  While class-\nwide  causation  depends  on  the  context,  see  Poulos  v. \nCaesars World, Inc., 379 F.3d 654, 665โ66 (9th Cir. 2004) \n(requiring individualized showing of causation in a โnarrow \nand case-specificโ RICO-claim case because โgambling is \nnot a context in which we can assume that potential class \nmembers are always similarly situatedโ), in Walker v. Life \nInsurance Co. of the Southwest, we recognized that reliance \ncan be inferred on a class-wide basis.  953 F.3d 624, 630โ31 \n(9th Cir. 2020).  Here, Owino offered as evidence a written \ndiscipline policy stating that detainees will be punished if \nthey fail to clean or obey staff orders.  The district court did \nnot abuse its discretion in concluding that a factfinder could \nreasonably draw a class-wide causation inference from this \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 249   Filed 12/20/22   PageID.9288   Page 18 of 498\n18  OWINO V. CORECIVIC, INC. \nuniform policy. \nHowever, CoreCivicโs appeal with respect to personal \njurisdiction is not resolved by what we wrote, above, with \nrespect to the National Forced Labor class.  See Bristol-\nMyers Squibb Co. v. Superior Ct. of Cal., 137 S. Ct. 1773 \n(2017).  The district court ruled that CoreCivic had waived \nits personal jurisdiction challenge with respect to the claim \nof the non-California-facility class members, because it did \nnot raise such a defense in its first responsive pleadings \n(which CoreCivic filed after the Supreme Court decided \nBristol-Myers Squibb).  After the district courtโs ruling and \nafter CoreCivic filed its opening brief in this appeal, the \nNinth Circuit squarely addressed this issue: prior to class \ncertification, a defendant does โnot have โavailableโ a Rule \n12(b)(2)  personal  jurisdiction  defense  to  the  claims  of \nunnamed putative class members who were not yet parties to \nthe case.โ  Moser v. Benefytt, Inc., 8 F.4th 872, 877 (9th Cir. \n2021). \nAlthough  Owino  maintains  that  Moser  was  wrongly \ndecided, we have no authority to ignore circuit precedent.  \nSee Miller v. Gammie, 335 F.3d 889, 900 (9th Cir. 2003) (en \nbanc).    Owinoโs  challenge  to  the  merit  of  CoreCivicโs \npersonal jurisdiction defense is an issue for the district court \nto resolve.  See Moser, 8 F.4th at 879. \nWe decline to vacate the certification of the National \nForced Labor class, but we hold that CoreCivic retains its \npersonal  jurisdiction  defense  and  remand  the  personal \njurisdiction question to the district court for consideration at \nthe appropriate time. \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 249   Filed 12/20/22   PageID.9289   Page 19 of 498\n  OWINO V. CORE CIVIC, INC.    19 \nIII.  CALIFORNIA LABOR LAW CLASS \nA.  Damages Capable of Class-wide Measurement \nWe  first  consider  CoreCivicโs  arguments  that  the \nmembers  of  the  California  Labor  Law  class  have  not \npresented โa fully formed damages modelโ and thus cannot \nbe certified.  Owino claims that CoreCivic misclassified the \ndetainees participating in the Work Program as โvolunteersโ \nrather than โemployeesโ and thus failed to pay them the \nminimum wage required in California for โemployees,โ in \nviolation of California wage and hour law.  The district court \ncertified  the  class,  holding  that  Owino  had  met  the \nโevidentiaryโ burden of โpresent[ing] proof that damages are \ncapable of being measured on a class-wide basis.โ \nWe agree with the district court that Owino did not need \nto present a fully formed damages model โwhen discovery \nwas not yet complete and pertinent records may have been \nstill within Defendantโs control.โ  Rather, โplaintiffs must \nshow  that  โdamages  are  capable  of  measurement  on  a \nclasswide basis,โ in the sense that the whole class suffered \ndamages traceable to the same injurious course of conduct \nunderlying the plaintiffsโ legal theory.โ  Just Film, Inc. v. \nBuono,  847  F.3d  1108,  1120  (9th  Cir.  2017)  (quoting \nComcast, 569 U.S. at 34).  In other words, โplaintiffs must \nbe  able  to  show  that  their  damages  stemmed  from  the \ndefendantโs actions that created the legal liability.โ  Vaquero \nv. Ashley Furniture Indus., Inc., 824 F.3d 1150, 1154 (9th \nCir. 2016) (citation omitted). \nThere is a clear line of causation between the alleged \nmisclassification of detainee employees as โvolunteersโ and \nthe deprivation of earnings they may have suffered as a \nconsequence of the violation of California wage and hour \nlaws.  See id. at 1155 (holding that, โ[i]n a wage and hour \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 249   Filed 12/20/22   PageID.9290   Page 20 of 498\n20  OWINO V. CORECIVIC, INC. \ncase  .  .  .  the  employer-defendantโs  actions  necessarily \ncaused the class membersโ injuryโ).  According to evidence \nfrom a CoreCivic manager, spreadsheets of wages paid, and \nCoreCivicโs  corporate  policy  itself,  ICE  detainees \nparticipated  in  the  Work  Program  across  CoreCivicโs \nfacilities, for which they were almost never paid more than \n$1.50 per day.  If CoreCivic did indeed misclassify these \nparticipants  as  โvolunteersโ  (e.g.,  because  the  detainees \nshould  have  been  considered  โemployeesโ),  CoreCivic \nwould necessarily have failed to pay the minimum hourly \nwage required by California law.  Thus, any damages that \nthe class members are owed necessarily โstemmed from \n[CoreCivicโs] actions.โ  Id.  \nOwino  presented  sufficient  evidence  to  show  that \ndamages are capable of measurement on a class-wide basis.  \nThis  evidence  includes  documentation  of  โtypicalโ  shift \nlengths, the days worked by ICE detainees, the wages paid, \nand  the  job  assignments.    Additional  testimony  and \nCoreCivic  records  can  establish  details  about  which \ndetainees participated in the Work Program, see Ridgeway v. \nWalmart Inc., 946 F.3d 1066, 1087 (9th Cir. 2020), and as \nthe Supreme Court emphasized in Tyson Foods, sufficiently \nreliable representative or statistical evidence can be used to \nestablish the hours that a class of employees had worked.  \n577 U.S. at 459. \nB.  Narrowing the Class \nIn seeking certification of the California Labor Law \nclass,  Owino  alleged  that  detaineesโ  participation  in  the \nProgram violated a variety of state labor law provisions, as \nwell as Californiaโs Unfair Competition Law (โUCLโ), Cal. \nBus.  &  Prof.  Code  ยง  17200,  et  seq.    CoreCivic  notes, \ncorrectly: โOther than the California UCL claim [which has \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 249   Filed 12/20/22   PageID.9291   Page 21 of 498\n  OWINO V. CORE CIVIC, INC.    21 \na four-year statute of limitations, id. ยง 17208], all other state \nlaw  claims  have  a  one-,  two-,  or  three-year  statute  of \nlimitations.โ  CoreCivic thus argues that Owino is barred \nfrom representing this class at all, because his last day in the \nWork Program was May 22, 2013, which is more than four \nyears before he filed the May 31, 2017, complaint.  (Owino \ndisputes this date, claiming he worked until his release on \nMarch 9, 2015.)  CoreCivic further argues that Gomez is \ntime-barred from pursuing non-UCL claims, because his last \nday in the Work Program was September 7, 2013. \nThe  district  court  held  that,  for  the  purposes  of  the \ncertification motion, even if the plaintiffsโ claims under the \nCalifornia  Labor  Code  are  time-barred,  they  could  still \nrecover for the majority of the alleged violations under the \nUCL because the UCL prohibits unfair competition, defined \nas  โany  unlawful,  unfair  or  fraudulent  business  act  or \npractice,โ Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code ยง 17200, and naturally this \nincludes such violations of Californiaโs wage and hour law.  \nUnder this characterization, the class period for all claims \nseeking remedies under the UCL begins May 31, 2013; the \nperiod for  waiting-time and failure-to-pay claims  begins \nMay 31, 2014; and the period for claims as to the alleged \nfailure to provide wage statements begins May 31, 2016 (for \nremedies pursuant to Cal. Code Civ. Proc. ยง 340), or May \n31, 2014 (for remedies pursuant to Cal. Code Civ. Proc. ยง \n338). \nAs to the named plaintiffs, the district court ruled that \nneither Owino nor Gomez is typical of the members of the \nCalifornia  Labor  Law  class  seeking  penalties  under \nCalifornia Labor Code ยง 226 (which requires employers to \nprovide wage statements to employees), and that Gomez is \nnot typical of members of the California Labor Law Class \nseeking waiting-time penalties under California Labor Code \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 249   Filed 12/20/22   PageID.9292   Page 22 of 498\n22  OWINO V. CORECIVIC, INC. \nยง 203.  Nonetheless, the court found that Owino is part of the \nCalifornia Labor Law class for the wage claims, for failure \nto pay compensation upon termination, and for waiting time \npenalties and actual damages for the failure to provide wage \nstatements, while Gomez is part of the California Labor Law \nclass for the wage claims.  Due to CoreCivicโs โbelated \nassertion of . . . factual disputes concerning whether Mr. \nOwino worked during the Class Period for the California \nLabor  Law  Class,โ  the  district  court  stated  it  was \nโdisinclined to resolve this issue at the class certification \nstage . . . particularly given that Mr. Gomez remains a viable \nclass representative for the majority of the claims of the \nCalifornia Labor Law Class.โ \nBecause  plaintiffs  can  recover  for  almost  all  of  the \nalleged violations under the UCL, the district court properly \nrejected  CoreCivicโs  argument  against  certification  as \npredicated on โa distinction without a difference.โ  The \ndistrict  court  appropriately  exercised  its  discretion  by \ndeclining to resolve a factual matter that CoreCivic raised \nfor the first time in its post-hearing supplemental brief, and \nwhich the district court concluded was not dispositive of \ncertification. \nWe agree with the district court that Owino and Gomez \nare typical of the class they are seeking to represent and their \nallegations,  if  true,  fit  within  the  statutes  they  invoke.  \nAlthough they may run into statute of limitations issuesโ\nsome disputed and unprovenโnarrowing the class based on \nstatute of limitations is not required at the certification stage.  \nCf.

Failure-to-pay and Waiting-time Claim \nFinally,  CoreCivic  argues  that  because  Owino  and \nGomez โdid not reference their failure-to-pay/waiting-time \nclaim ([Cal. Labor Code] ยงยง 201โ203)โ in their motion for \nclass certification, the district court should not have certified \nthat claim as one common to the California Labor Law class.  \nBecause the claims are affirmatively interwoven in Owinoโs \npleadings, the district court did not abuse its discretion in \ncertifying this claim. \nTo begin, the complaint included California Labor Code \nยงยง 201โ03 among the causes of action for the California \nLabor Law class: \nPlaintiffs and Class Members incorporate the \nabove allegations by reference. \n \nCalifornia  Labor  Code  ยงยง  201  and  202 \nrequire CoreCivic to pay all compensation \ndue  and  owing  to  Plaintiffs  and  Class \nMembers  immediately  upon  discharge  or \nwithin seventy-two hours of their termination \nof  employment.    Cal.  Labor  Code  ยง  203 \nprovides that if an employer willfully fails to \npay compensation promptly upon discharge \nor resignation, as required by ยงยง 201 and 202, \nthen the employer is liable for such โwaiting \ntimeโ  penalties  in  the  form  of  continued \ncompensation up to thirty workdays. \n \nCoreCivic willfully failed to pay Plaintiffs \nand  Class  Members  who  are  no  longer \nemployed by CoreCivic compensation due \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 249   Filed 12/20/22   PageID.9294   Page 24 of 498\n24  OWINO V. CORECIVIC, INC. \nupon termination as required by Cal. Labor \nCode ยงยง 201 and 202.  As a result, CoreCivic \nis liable to Plaintiffs and former employee \nClass  Members  waiting  time  penalties \nprovided under Cal. Labor Code ยง 203, plus \nreasonable attorneysโ fees and costs of suit. \n \nOwino  asserted  that  CoreCivic  violated  a  dozen \nprovisions of the California Labor Code with respect to the \nmembers of the California Labor Law class.  The motion for \nclass certification then stated, โPlaintiffsโ claims on behalf \nof the CA Labor Law Class for violations of the California \nLabor Code . . . all turn on a common legal question: whether \nICE detainees that worked through the [Work Program] at \nCoreCivicโs  facilities  in  California  are  employees  of \nCoreCivic under California law . . . .โ  Owino then discussed \nthis question in depth. \nCoreCivic has cited no precedent to suggest that Owino \nmust  specifically  list  the  citation  of  each  of  the  dozen \nprovisions of the California Labor Code in the motion for \nclass certification.  Such an approach would exalt form over \nsubstance and ignore the fair notice Owino provided to \nCoreCivic throughout the certification proceeding.  Rather, \nbecause Owino outlined these provisions substantively in the \ncomplaint, stated that โallโ of the alleged violations of the \nLabor Code turn on a common question, and discussed the \ncommon question at length, Owino sufficiently referenced \nthis matter before the district court. \n   \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 249   Filed 12/20/22   PageID.9295   Page 25 of 498\n  OWINO V. CORE CIVIC, INC.    25 \nConclusion \nWe affirm the district courtโs certification of all three \nclasses.    We  hold  that  CoreCivic  retains  its  personal \njurisdiction defense and remand the personal jurisdiction \nquestion  to  the  district  court  for  consideration  at  the \nappropriate juncture. \nAFFIRMED. \n \n \nVANDYKE,  Circuit  Judge,  with  whom  Judges \nCALLAHAN, BENNETT, R. NELSON, and BUMATAY \njoin, and with whom Judge IKUTA joins except as to Part \nII-A, dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc: \n \nIn affirming certification of the nationwide class in this \ncase, the panel committed two errors that merited en banc \nreview.    First,  the  panel  created  inter-  and  intra-circuit \nconflicts by eliminating the actual causation requirement for \nโforced laborโ claims under the Victims of Trafficking and \nViolence Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA).  Second, the panel \ntransgressed the holding of Wal-Mart Stores v. Dukes, 564 \nU.S.  338  (2011),  disregarding  Rule  23โs  commonality \nrequirement by concluding that a handful of declarations \nfrom detainees at only one of the defendantโs 24 facilities \nwas  โsignificant  proofโ  of  the  defendantโs  nationwide \nโpolicies  and  practices.โ    In  Dukes,  the  Supreme  Court \ninstructed that expert testimony, statistical evidence, and \ntestimony from more than 100 individuals spread across the \ncountry were insufficient proof of the nationwide policy \nasserted in that case.  Here, the plaintiffs did not present half \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 249   Filed 12/20/22   PageID.9296   Page 26 of 498\n26  OWINO V. CORECIVIC, INC. \nas much evidence as was provided in Dukes, yet the panel \nimproperly found โsignificant proofโ of a nationwide policy. \nWe should have taken the opportunity to correct this \ndecision.  Uncorrected, it will have sweeping implications \nfor  all  civil  TVPA  lawsuits,  class  actions  or  otherwise, \nsowing confusion over whether actual causation is a required \nshowing.  It will also doubtless become the new rallying \npoint  for  class  counsel  seeking  to  avoid  the  minimum \ncommonality required by binding Supreme Court precedent.  \nI respectfully dissent from the denial of en banc rehearing. \nI.   \nThe U.S. government contracts with the defendant in this \ncase, CoreCivic, Inc., to hold immigration detainees in 24 \nfacilities across 11 states.  Government regulations require \nimmigration detainees to perform personal housekeeping \ntasks, but prohibit CoreCivic from requiring them to clean \nareas beyond โtheir immediate living areas.โ  Performance-\nBased National Detention Standards 2011 ยง 5.8(II), (V)(C).  \nThis  case  is  a  class  challenge  by  two  former  detainees \nclaiming that they and other detainees across all 24 facilities \nwere forced to perform cleaning tasks beyond the personal \nhousekeeping tasks allowed by those standards.  See Owino \nv. CoreCivic, Inc., 36 F.4th 839, 842 (9th Cir. 2022). \nThe named plaintiffs moved to certify a nationwide class \nconsisting  of  all  CoreCivic  detainees  detained  after \nDecember 23, 2008, who were required under threat of \ndiscipline to clean areas of CoreCivic facilities beyond their \ncells.  See id. at 843.  To succeed on their motion, they \nneeded to prove that โquestions of law or fact common to the \nclassโ  existed  and  that  such  common  questions \nโpredominate[d]  over  any  questions  affecting  only \nindividual members.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2), (b)(3); see \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 249   Filed 12/20/22   PageID.9297   Page 27 of 498\n  OWINO V. CORE CIVIC, INC.    27 \nalso Halliburton Co. v. Erica P. John Fund, Inc., 573 U.S. \n258,  275  (2014)  (requiring  the  plaintiffs  to  prove,  โnot \nsimply  plead,โ  that  โtheir  proposed  class  satisfies  each \nrequirement of Rule 23โ).  The named plaintiffs argued that \na  common  question  stemmed  from  CoreCivicโs  policy \nrequiring all its detainees to clean areas beyond their cells \nunder  threat  of  discipline  and  that  this  question \npredominated over any individualized questions.  Because \nthey  sought  to  prove  a  common  question  through  a \nnationwide policy, the named plaintiffs needed to provide \nโsignificant proofโ that this policy existed.  Dukes, 564 U.S. \nat  353  (citation  omitted).    As  evidence  of  CoreCivicโs \npurported nationwide policy requiring all detainees to clean \nareas  beyond  their  cells,  the  named  plaintiffs  proffered \nCoreCivicโs  written  โSanitationโ  and  โDisciplinaryโ \npolicies, plus the declarations of four detainees at one of \nCoreCivicโs 24 detention facilities.   \nThe district court considered whether the written policies \nunambiguously  supported  CoreCivicโs  interpretation  and \nthen rejected it because it โis not clear from the face of the \npoliciesโ that the policies โdo[] not require detainees to clean \nthe common area,โ (emphasis added).  The court likewise \nfound  the  policies  ambiguous  because  โ[t]here  is  no \nindication  from  the  face  of  the  policies  thatโ  only  the \ndetainees who participated in the voluntary work program \n(โVWPโ) were required to clean.  The district courtโs only \ndiscussion  about  who  was  required  to  clean  under \nCoreCivicโs written policies emphasized their ambiguity.  \nBut  because  the  named  plaintiffs  also  offered  the  four \ndetainee declarations, the court concluded that there was \nโsignificant  proofโ  that  CoreCivic  had  โimplemented \ncommon  sanitation  and  discipline  policies,โ  (emphasis \nadded), across its 24 facilities.  And the court concluded that \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 249   Filed 12/20/22   PageID.9298   Page 28 of 498\n28  OWINO V. CORECIVIC, INC. \nbecause  the  Disciplinary  Policy  โcould  reasonably  be \nunderstood  to  have  subjected  detainees  to  discipline  for \nfailure  to  comply  with  the  uniform  sanitation  policy,โ \nCoreCivic โmay have coerced detaineesโ into cleaning. \nThe district court also concluded that common questions \nabout  CoreCivicโs  class-wide  โpolicy  and  practiceโ \npredominated over individualized questions.  On this point, \nCoreCivic argued that questions about whether CoreCivicโs \nconduct caused the class members individually to choose to \nlabor for CoreCivic would predominate over any common \nquestion.    The  district  court  disagreed,  concluding  that \nliability  under  the  TVPA  attaches  even  if  CoreCivicโs \nactions did not cause the detainees to perform the labor.  The \ncourt ruled instead that the TVPA requires plaintiffs to show \nonly an โobjectively, sufficiently serious threat of harm.โ  \nAlternatively, the district court reasoned that, even assuming \nthe TVPA requires a showing of causation, whether each \nindividual class member felt coerced by CoreCivicโs policies \ncould be decided on a class basis by inferring whether a \nreasonable person would have felt coerced. \nOn appeal, our court affirmed certification.  See Owino, \n36 F.4th at 850.  In doing so, the panel rejected CoreCivicโs \nargument  that  questions  about  individual  causation \nprecluded  predominance,  never  addressing  either  of  our \ncourtโs precedents holding that a showing of causation is \nrequired  under  the  TVPA.    Compare  id.  at  847,  with \nMartinez-Rodriguez v. Giles, 31 F.4th 1139, 1150 (9th Cir. \n2022), and Headley v. Church of Scientology Intโl, 687 F.3d \n1173, 1179 (9th Cir. 2012).  Rather, the panel held that no \nโsubjective,  individualized  inquiryโ  into  why  each  class \nmember  labored  was  necessary  because  the  ostensibly \nโcontrary  languageโ  in  the  TVPA  requires  only  that  a \ndefendantโs threats be objectively serious.  See id. (citing 18 \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 249   Filed 12/20/22   PageID.9299   Page 29 of 498\n  OWINO V. CORE CIVIC, INC.    29 \nU.S.C.  ยง 1589(c)(2)  (requiring  an  objectively  โserious \nharmโ)).  Although cursory in its analysis, the necessary \nimport of the panel rejecting CoreCivicโs argumentโby \nexclusively  citing  the  TVPAโs  objectively  serious  harm \nrequirementโis that the plaintiffs did not need to show that \nCoreCivicโs actions caused them to labor. \nThe  panel  also  concluded  that  the  named  plaintiffs \nproved the existence of a common question, locating that \ncommon question in โCoreCivicโs company-wide policies \nand practices.โ  Owino, 36 F.4th at 846.  The panel relied on \nthree  things  evincing  the  supposed  nationwide  common \nโpolicies and practicesโ: (1) CoreCivicโs written policies; \n(2) CoreCivicโs employeesโ declarations interpreting those \nwritten  policies;  and  (3) declarations  by  four  former \ndetainees  that  described  practices  they  experienced  and \nobserved at a single facility.  See id. at 845.     \nAs  to  the  first  two  types  of  evidenceโCoreCivicโs \nwritten policies and its interpretations thereofโthe panel \nprovided little analysis, briefly addressing them in two short \nparagraphs.  See id.  The panel was nonetheless clear that it \nrelied  decisively  on  its  conclusion  that  CoreCivicโs \nnationwide written policy โrequires detaineesโ to perform a \nlong  list  of  cleaning  duties.    Id.    The  panel  nowhere \nacknowledged,  however,  that  its  list  was  taken  from \nCoreCivicโs policy applicable only to โdetainee[] workers,โ \n(emphasis added), which CoreCivic employees consistently \nexplained meant not all detainees, but rather a subset of \ndetainees who had affirmatively volunteered to participate in \nits paid VWP.  Ignoring the district courtโs conclusion that \nthe written policies are ambiguous, the panel held that the \nwritten policies required all detainees to clean and that, when \ncombined  with  the  four  detainee  declarations,  they \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 249   Filed 12/20/22   PageID.9300   Page 30 of 498\n30  OWINO V. CORECIVIC, INC. \nconstituted  โsignificant  proofโ  of  a  nationwide  policy \nconsistent with the plaintiffsโ allegations.  See id.   \nAccordingly,  the  panel  affirmed  certification  of  the \nnationwide  class.    Following  CoreCivicโs  petition  for \nrehearing, the panel amended its opinion in an attempt to \nclarify its rationale on the TVPAโs causation requirement.  \nUnfortunately, as discussed below, the amendment does not \nfix the panelโs errors. \nII.  \nThis case deserved en banc review for two independent \nreasons:  (1) it  creates  inter-  and  intra-circuit  conflict  by \neliminating the TVPAโs actual causation requirement for \ncivil forced labor claims; and (2) it holds that much less \nevidence of a nationwide policy than was present in Dukes \nis nonetheless โsignificant proofโ of a nationwide policy, \nand therefore sufficient to certify a class.   \nA.   \nThe TVPA prohibits a person from obtaining labor from \na victim by improper means.  See 18 U.S.C. ยง 1589(a).  A \ndefendant who obtains forced labor may be held civilly \nliable.  See id.; 18 U.S.C. ยง 1595(a).1  But according to the \npanel  decision  in  this  case,  the  TVPA,  in  permitting \nโvictim[s]โ of โforced laborโ to โrecover damages,โ id., is \nindifferent as to whether anyone actually forced someone \nelse to labor.  See Owino, 36 F.4th at 847.  Instead, a plaintiff \nmay satisfy the TVPAโs causation requirement by showing \nthat  an  abstract  reasonable  person  would  have  labored \nbecause of the defendantโs conduct.  Only by deeming actual \n \n1 A defendant who obtains or attempts to obtain forced labor may also \nbe criminally punished.

CORE CIVIC, INC.    31 \ncausation unnecessary was the panel able to conclude that \nindividualized causation inquiries would not predominate \nover common questions in the named plaintiffsโ class action.  \nSee id. \nThe panelโs causation conclusion is doubly wrong.  First, \nit is wrong because it creates inter- and intra-circuit conflict \nby disregarding both our binding circuit precedent, see, e.g., \nMartinez-Rodriguez, 31 F.4th at 1156 (requiring that the \nplaintiffs  provide  evidence  that  the  defendantโs  conduct \nโproximately  causedโ  the  plaintiffs  to  labor),  and  the \nwisdom of our sister circuitsโ decisions that likewise require \na showing of actual causation to prevail in a TVPA forced \nlabor claim, see, e.g., United States v. Zhong, 26 F.4th 536, \n560 (2d Cir. 2022) (recognizing that unless the prosecution \nproves  a  defendantโs  actions  โdid,  in  fact,  compel \nthe โฆ workers  to  remain  working  for  [the  defendantโs \ncompany]  when  they  otherwise  would  have  left,โ  the \ndefendant โcould not have โprovide[d] or obtain[ed]โ their \nlabor  th[r]ough  these  actions  or  threatsโ  (quoting \nยง 1589(a))); Menocal v. GEO Group, Inc., 882 F.3d 905, 918 \n(10th Cir. 2018) (โ[P]laintiffs must prove that an unlawful \nmeans of coercion caused them to render labor.โ).2  \n \n2 Similar to the panelโs amended opinion, the Tenth Circuit in Menocal \npermitted causation to be inferred class-wide.  See 882 F.3d at 918.  But \nthe  Tenth  Circuit  still  required  actual  causation  by  allowing  the \ndefendant to introduce evidence that individual class members were not \ncoerced by the defendantโs class-wide conduct.  See id. at 921.  Here, the \npanel acknowledged no room for a defendant to introduce evidence that \nindividual class members did not labor because of its class-wide conduct, \nimplying  that  the  panel  established  a  conclusive  presumption  that \ncausation is satisfied for a TVPA claim through evidence of class-wide \nconduct that would cause a reasonable person to labor.  No circuit has \ndeparted so far from the TVPAโs actual causation requirement. \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 249   Filed 12/20/22   PageID.9302   Page 32 of 498\n32  OWINO V. CORECIVIC, INC. \nSecond,  even  aside  from  the  panel  ignoring  binding \nprecedent, this case merited en banc review because the text \nof the TVPA clearly requires causation for a forced labor \nclaimโwhich is why, until this case, our circuit and other \ncircuits have required it.  See 18 U.S.C. ยง 1589(a)(2), (4).  \nThe panel confused and conflated the TVPAโs requirement \nthat harms or threatened harms be objectively serious with \nthe TVPAโs separate requirement that such harms actually \ncause a victim to labor or provide services.  Actual causation \nrequires  proof  that  the  specific  victim  would  not  have \nlabored but for the threats or harms.   The TVPA requires \nboth objectively serious harms and actual causation.  The \npanelโs  error  in  eliminating  the  TVPAโs  causation \nrequirement  led  the  panel  to  wrongly  affirm  class \ncertification.    Because  each  class  member  here  must \nindividually prove causation, the panel erred in concluding \nthat  common  questions  predominated.    See  Poulos  v. \nCaesars World, Inc., 379 F.3d 654, 668 (9th Cir. 2004). \n*    *    * \nThe  panelโs  elimination  of  the  TVPAโs  causation \nrequirement  runs  face-first  into  at  least  two  of  our \nprecedents, as well as the decisions of our sister circuits that \nhave addressed this issue.  In our courtโs 2012 Headley \ndecision, for example, lack of individualized causation is \nprecisely what drove our court to affirm summary judgment \nin favor of the defendant.  687 F.3d at 1173.  The plaintiffs \nin Headley argued that they were coerced into laboring by \nthe defendant organization inflicting harm upon them, but \nour court affirmed summary judgment against the plaintiffs \nbecause the โrecord does not suggest that the defendant[] \nobtained the [plaintiffsโ] labor โby means ofโ those[harms].โ  \nId. at 1180.  The court instead concluded that โthe record \nshows that the adverse consequences cited by the [plaintiffs] \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 249   Filed 12/20/22   PageID.9303   Page 33 of 498\n  OWINO V. CORE CIVIC, INC.    33 \nare overwhelmingly not of the type that caused them to \ncontinue their work and to remain with the [organization].โ  \nId. (emphasis added).  And only months before the panel \nissued its decision in this case, our court again affirmed that \na plaintiff can succeed in a forced labor claim only if he \nshows that the defendantโs unlawful conduct โcaused the \n[p]laintiff to provide the labor that [the defendant] obtained.โ  \nMartinez-Rodriguez, 31 F.4th at 1150 (emphasis in original). \nIn holding that the named plaintiffs need not show that \nthe defendantโs conduct caused them to labor before stating \na  forced  labor  claim,  the  panel  advanced  a  novel \ninterpretation of the TVPAโs prohibition on forced labor that \nno federal circuit had previously adopted: holding that a \ndefendant may be civilly liable for forced labor when its \nconduct did not cause the plaintiff to labor.  Three other \ncircuitsโfive,  if  we  count  unpublished  decisionsโhave \neither explained that a defendantโs conduct must actually \ncause the victim to labor or relied on such causation to \nuphold a criminal conviction.  See, e.g., Zhong, 26 F.4th at \n560 (2d Cir. 2022); United States v. Toure, 965 F.3d 393, \n401โ02 (5th Cir. 2020) (affirming a forced labor conviction \nas supported by sufficient evidence, in part, because the \ndefendantsโ โconduct caused [the victim] to remain with the \ndefendants  because  [the  victim]  faced  threats  of  serious \nharm, or reasonably believed she would face serious harm, \nif she did not provide them with her labor and servicesโ); \nMenocal, 882 F.3d at 918 (10th Cir. 2018); see also United \nStates v.

CORE CIVIC, INC.    35 \ncausal relationshipโโeven if not a โdecisive effectโโโto \nthat decisionโ).   \nIn  rejecting  โCoreCivicโs  argument  that  the  TVPA \nnecessitates  a  subjective,  individualized  inquiryโ  into \ncausation, the panel ignored the TVPAโs โby means ofโ \nlanguage and instead cited the TVPAโs provision defining \nโserious harmโ as an objectively serious harm.  Owino, 36 \nF.4th at 847 (citing 18 U.S.C. ยง 1589(c)(2)).  The panel was \nright that the particular provision it cited does not itself \nrequire actual causation.  But the existence of the TVPAโs \nrequirement that harms and threatened harms be objectively \nserious  does  not  somehow  nullify  the  TVPAโs  separate \nrequirement that a defendant obtain labor by means of such \nserious harm or threatened harmโthe TVPAโs causation \nrequirement.  In sum, a plaintiff who labored because a \ndefendant threatened harm that would not cause a reasonable \nperson to labor has no forced labor claim because he cannot \nshow an objectively serious threat of harm.  And likewise, a \nplaintiff who labored for a reason wholly unrelated to the \ndefendantโs harms or threatened harms has no claimโeven \nif  those  harms  or  threatened  harms  were  objectively \nseriousโbecause he cannot show the defendant obtained the \nplaintiffโs labor by means of those threats.  The panel was \nwrong to conclude that plaintiffs in this latter categoryโ\nplaintiffs  who  didnโt  labor  because  of  the  defendantโs \nconductโcan succeed in bringing a forced labor claim. \nThe panelโs belated attempt to address this problem by \namending its opinion does not, unfortunately, fix it.  The \namended opinion does just as much damage to the TVPAโs \ncausation requirement for forced labor claims as its original \nopinion, just with different language.  In its original opinion, \nthe panel eliminated the TVPAโs requirement that a plaintiff \nshow individualized causationโthat the defendant caused \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 249   Filed 12/20/22   PageID.9306   Page 36 of 498\n36  OWINO V. CORECIVIC, INC. \nthe specific plaintiff to labor.  In its amended opinion, the \npanel  acknowledges  that  the  TVPAโs  โby  means  ofโ \nlanguage requires some form of causation.  But then the \npanel immediately makes clear that it is really removing the \nTVPAโs actual causation requirement by concluding that \ncausation may be inferred class-wide through a generally \napplicable policy.  To make this leap, the panel must assume \nboth that (1) every person in the class is reasonable and (2) \nthe policy actually causes every reasonable person to labor.  \nBut it is easily foreseeable that, even assuming plaintiffsโ \nallegations of class-wide threats are true, some portion of the \nclass would clean merely because they liked to live in a clean \nspace.  It is reasonable to believe that many normal human \nbeings would voluntarily sweep or wipe down furniture in \ncommon areas simply because they enjoy living in a clean \nenvironment.  The panelโs new description of โcausationโ \nisnโt actual causation, it is probable causation applied to an \nabstract reasonable person, and therefore isnโt real causation \nat all.  Which brings us right back to the original opinionโs \nconflation  of  the  TVPAโs  objective  standard  with  its \nrequirement for individualized causation.  The panel cannot \nhave it both ways: either the TVPA requires actual causation \nor it does not.  The opinion as now amended forswears it has \neliminated causation, but if anything, it is now even clearer \nthat the TVPAโs requirement of actual causation no longer \nexists  (or  at  least  that  panels  of  our  court  have  taken \ninconsistent positions). \nIn any event, the panelโs amendment leaves in place the \noriginal  opinionโs  statement  that  the  TVPAโs  objective \nstandard means that the TVPA does not โnecessitate[] a \nsubjective,  individualized  inquiry.โ    Id.    That  incorrect \nstatement of law remains on the books, and, despite the \namended  opinionโs  attempt  to  have  it  both  ways,  will \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 249   Filed 12/20/22   PageID.9307   Page 37 of 498\n  OWINO V. CORE CIVIC, INC.    37 \ncontinueโat  odds  with  our  own  prior  precedentโto \ncommunicate that actual causation is not required by the \nTVPA. \nBy ignoring in- and out-of-circuit precedent and the text \nof the TVPA, the panel created both intra- and inter-circuit \nconflict on whether a plaintiff must show actual causation \nfor a forced labor claim under the TVPA.  The panelโs \nremoval of the TVPAโs causation requirement will plague \nour cases going forward.  The court should have granted \nrehearing en banc to eliminate a conflict in our precedent and \nrestore the correct interpretation of the TVPA.   \nB.   \nEven if the panel had not created confusion through its \nincorrect conclusion that the TVPA requires no proof of \nactual causation, the panel still erred in certifying this class.  \nRule 23 requires that the movant prove the class shares a \ncommon question of law or fact.  See Halliburton Co., 573 \nU.S. at 275.  The panel concluded that the nationwide class \nhere shared a common question based on the declarations of \nfour detainees, all  from the same facility, together with \ncorporate  policies  that  are  at  best  ambiguous  as  to  the \nmisconduct claimed in those declarations.  See Owino, 36 \nF.4th  at  845.    The  panel  thus  created  a  new  rule  of \ncommonality that authorizes class certification so long as a \nmovant can offer anecdotal evidence of misconduct limited \nto a small fraction of a class, coupled with written policies \nthat at most are unclear about the complained-of conduct.  \nThat rule is inconsistent with Rule 23 and Dukes, and charts \nan attractive and sure-to-be-followed path for those seeking \nan easy class action certification. \nUnder Dukes, to prove commonality through a policy, a \nplaintiff must offer โsignificant proofโ that the complained-\n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 249   Filed 12/20/22   PageID.9308   Page 38 of 498\n38  OWINO V. CORECIVIC, INC. \nof practice exists class-wide.  564 U.S. at 353.  Although the \nSupreme Court declined to offer a bright line rule for what \ncounts as โsignificant proof,โ we see clearly in Dukes what \ndoes not suffice: the combination of (1) an official policy of \ndiscretion that can be used for unlawful activity, (2) expert \ntestimony that the permissive policy is used for unlawful \nactivity, (3) statistical evidence merely suggesting unlawful \nactivity, and (4) testimony of the unlawful activity from \nmore  than  one-hundred  potential  class  members  spread \nacross multiple locations.  See id. at 353โ58. \nSince  the  plaintiffs  in  Dukes  failed  to  clear  the \ncommonality threshold, a fortiori the named plaintiffs in this \ncase failed.  Here, the second and third categories above \nwere completely missing.  And the first category of evidence \nwas no better here than it was in Dukes because, as the \ndistrict court acknowledged, the policies relied on by the \nnamed  plaintiffs  were  at  most  โnot  clearโ  as  to  the \nmisconduct alleged.  And this case is worse than Dukes as to \nthe fourth category because the plaintiffsโ testimony here is \nlimited to one out of dozens of locations.   \nThe written policies in this case merit more discussion \nbecause,  while  the  panelโs  analysis  of  those  policies  is \nfrustratingly brief, it is nonetheless clear that the panel put \ndecisive weight on those policies.  The named plaintiffs \nattempted to prove that CoreCivic has a policy requiring all \ndetainees to โcleanโ the common living areas and to threaten \nthose  who  refuse  with  discipline.    They  presented  two \nwritten  policies  that  the  plaintiffs  contend  require  โall \ndetaineesโ  to  clean  the  common  living  areas  or  suffer \ndisciplinary action.  But the policies the named plaintiffs \ncited do not say that; rather, only โdetainee[] workersโ must \nclean  the  common  living  areas  and  detainees  risk \ndisciplinary  action  only  if  they  refuse  to  clean  their \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 249   Filed 12/20/22   PageID.9309   Page 39 of 498\n  OWINO V. CORE CIVIC, INC.    39 \nโassigned living area[s],โ (emphasis added).  At best, these \npolicies  are  ambiguous  about  the  very  thing  the  named \nplaintiffs needed to prove: the duties of โ[a]ll detainees.โ  \nAmbiguity is not โsignificant proof.โ  Id. at 353. \nThe  first  policy  the  named  plaintiffs  cited  was  the \nSanitation Policy.  That policy distinguishes the duties of \nโ[a]ll detaineesโ from the duties of โdetainee[] workers.โ  \nโAll  detainees โฆ are  responsible  for  maintaining  the \ncommon living area in a clean and sanitary manner.โ  But \nonly โdetainee[] workersโ clean those areas.  CoreCivic \nofficials uniformly testified that the โworkersโ referenced in \nthe Sanitation Policy are the participants in its voluntary \nwork program.  Moreover, because only workers โclean[],โ \nthe policy cannot plausibly mean that โall detainees[]โ must \nclean the common living areas.  To conclude otherwise \nrenders superfluous the policyโs distinction between โall \ndetaineesโ and โdetainee workers.โ  See DaVita Inc. v. Amyโs \nKitchen, Inc., 981 F.3d 664, 674 (9th Cir. 2020) (presuming \nthat  a  difference  in  language  carries  a  difference  in \nmeaning); Rainsong Co. v. FERC, 151 F.3d 1231, 1234 (9th \nCir.  1998)  (explaining  that  interpretations  rendering \nlanguage in a statute or regulation superfluous โare to be \navoidedโ (citation omitted)).   \nThe  district  court  found  the  Sanitation  Policy \nambiguous.  Because the panelโs task was to review for \nabuse of discretion, it was obligated to defer to this finding \nunless it was clearly erroneous.  See B.K. by next friend \nTinsley v. Snyder, 922 F.3d 957, 966 (9th Cir. 2019).  That \nfinding was not clearly erroneous, and the panel was thus \npresented with an ambiguous written policy.  An ambiguous \npolicy, however, is not materially different than the policy \nthat was insufficient in Dukes: both policies might allow the \ncomplained-of misconduct, but neither require it. \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 249   Filed 12/20/22   PageID.9310   Page 40 of 498\n40  OWINO V. CORECIVIC, INC. \nThe second written policy the named plaintiffs cited was \nthe  Disciplinary  Policy,  which  prohibits  detainees  from \nโ[r]efus[ing]  to  clean  assigned  living  area[s].โ    The \nSanitation Policy clarifies that the โassigned living areasโ are \nthe detaineesโ personal cells and contrasts those cells with \nthe โcommon living area.โ  But if the โassigned living areaโ \nthat  the  Disciplinary  Policy  punishes  detainees  for  not \ncleaning is the detaineesโ personal cells, then this policy does \nnot require any cleaning that the named plaintiffs claim was \nimproper.  After all, the named plaintiffs had not attempted \nto certify a class of detainees forced to clean their own cell \nand  have  never  contended  that  such  a  requirement  is \nproblematic.  This policy is thus, like the Sanitation Policy, \nunhelpful  to  proving  that  all  CoreCivic  detainees  were \nrequired  by  any  class-wide  written  policy  to  clean  the \ncommon living area.   \nIn Dukes, the plaintiffs at least offered evidence of an \nofficial  policy  of  discretion  that  permitted  the  unlawful \nactivity.  Here, it is a stretch to read CoreCivicโs written \npolicies as even permitting the conduct complained of by the \nnamed  plaintiffs.    The  facilities  could  require  โ[a]ll \ndetaineesโ to clean common living areas only by reading โall \ndetaineesโ to mean the same thing as โdetainee workersโ and \nthus intentionally obfuscating the language of the Sanitation \nPolicy.  The most that can be said about CoreCivicโs written \npolicies is that, at best, they might permit the complained-of \npractice.  This is what the district court concluded.  But that \nis clearly not enough under Dukes to suffice as โsignificant \nproofโ of a class-wide policy requiring all detainees to clean. \nBeyond the written policies, the named plaintiffsโ only \nother evidence to satisfy their burden of โsignificant proofโ \nof  a  common  policy  was  their  four  declarations  from \ndetaineesโall housed at the same, single facility.  That is of \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 249   Filed 12/20/22   PageID.9311   Page 41 of 498\n  OWINO V. CORE CIVIC, INC.    41 \nno help to the named plaintiffs, because the named plaintiffsโ \ndeclarations merely provide anecdotal support  indicating \nthat CoreCivic may have had an unwritten policy requiring \nall detainees to clean the common living area at that one \nfacility.  Four declarations from one of 24 facilities cannot \nprovide โsignificant proofโ of an unwritten policy that was \napplied  to  thousands,  and  potentially  โhundreds  of \nthousands,โ  of  detainees  across  all  CoreCivic  facilities.  \nBecause these four declarations were โconcentrated in onlyโ \none  facility,  the  other  23  facilities  were  left  with  no \nโanecdotes about [CoreCivicโs] operations at all.โ  Dukes, \n564 U.S. at 358.  The panel could not properly assume that \none facilityโs unwritten practice was adopted and applied in \nevery one of CoreCivicโs other facilities.  And the named \nplaintiffs offered no evidence whatsoever that it was, falling \nwoefully short of their burden of โsignificant proofโ of a \nclass-wide policy. \nThe panelโs opinion ignored these serious problems.  It \ndid not engage with the different sections of the Sanitation \nPolicy  or  consider  the  testimony  from  CoreCivicโs \nemployees.  Instead, the panel referenced portions of the \nSanitation Policy that apply only to โdetainee workersโโ\nwithout even acknowledging that the policy distinguishes \nbetween  โdetainee  workersโ  and  โall  detaineesโโand \nconcluded that the Sanitation Policy, when supplemented \nwith the four detainee declarations, evinced a class-wide \npolicy requiring all detainees to labor.  See Owino, 36 F.4th \nat 845.  The panel also read the Sanitation Policy to require \ndetainees  to  โundertake  sundry  other  cleaning \nresponsibilities  across  the  facility,โ  a  requirement  not \nappearing in the policy.  Id.  In its short two-paragraph \nanalysis, the panel applied a new rule that flips the script on \nthe Dukes commonality rule: a movant for class certification \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 249   Filed 12/20/22   PageID.9312   Page 42 of 498\n42  OWINO V. CORECIVIC, INC. \nmust  simply  provide  some  class-wide  official  policyโ\nhowever ambiguous as to the claimed misconductโand a \nfew declarations indicating that the defendant engaged in \nmisconduct somewhere, sometime. \nUltimately, the panelโs new rule takes us down a familiar \nroad  where  the  seasoned  traveler  can  easily  predict  the \ndestination.  In 2004, a court in the Northern District of \nCalifornia certified a class of โat least 1.5 million womenโ \nwho were or had been employed by Wal-Mart.  Dukes v. \nWal-Mart Stores, Inc., 222 F.R.D. 137, 142, 188 (N.D. Cal. \n2004).    These  plaintiffs  sought  monetary  damages  and \nequitable relief for discrimination in pay and promotions.  \nSee id. at 141.  After first affirming in a panel opinion, we \nwent en banc and affirmed again, holding that the plaintiffs \nproved that the nearly 1.5 million-member nationwide class \nshared a common question.  In Dukes we had more proof of \nclass-wide conduct than the panel had here: we relied on a \ncompany-wide  policy  giving  managers  discretion  in \nemployment  decisions,  expert  testimony  suggesting  that \nWal-Martโs culture prejudiced women, statistical disparities \nbetween promotions of men and women, and testimony from \n120 employees located in different stores nationwide saying \nthey had experienced discrimination.  Dukes v. Wal-Mart \nStores, Inc., 603 F.3d 571, 600โ13 (9th Cir. 2010) (en banc).  \nThat was enough for us.  \nIt was not enough for the Supreme Court.  The Court \nunanimously reversed us, with the majority holding that we \nerred in concluding that there was even a single common \nquestion.  The Court reminded us that โthere is a wide gap \nbetweenโ an individualโs alleged injury, inflicted through a \nโcompany โฆ policy,โ  and  โthe  existence  of  a  class  of \npersons who have suffered the same injury [such] thatโ the \nindividual  and  class  claims  share  โcommon  questions.โ  \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-SBC   Document 249   Filed 12/20/22   PageID.9313   Page 43 of 498\n  OWINO V. CORE CIVIC, INC.    43 \nDukes, 564 U.S. at 352โ53 (quotation omitted).  And the \nCourt reminded us that a common question can arise from a \ncorporate policy only through โsignificant proof.โ  Id. at 353.  \nBecause our opinion affirming the class certification relied \nsolely on an irrelevant policy, immaterial expert testimony, \nand anecdotal testimony, the Court reversed.  See id. at 354โ\n60. \nI would say that the panel here repeated our error in \nDukes, but it did worse.  At least in Dukes, we had anecdotal \nevidence from multiple locations nationwide.  We also had \nstatistical evidence and expert testimony that we do not have \nhere.  And in Dukes, we could rely on an official policy that \nat least implicitly permitted the unlawful conduct.  The panel \naffirmed in this case by relying solely on anecdotal evidence \nfrom one of dozens of locations, and corporate policies that \nare at best ambiguous on whether CoreCivic had a โpolicyโ \nthat required detainees to labor.  See Owino, 36 F.4th at 845โ\n46.

Sexual abuse and assault is never the victimโs fault. Knowing the warning signs and red flags can help you stay alert and aware:  1.Report concerns.  2. Carry yourself in a confident manner. Many abusers choose victims who look like they would not fight back or who they think are emotionally weak.  3. Do not accept gifts or favors from others. Gifts or favors can come with demands or terms that the giver expects you to accept.  4. Do not accept an offer from another detainee to  .cbe your protector. n5. Find a staff member with whom you feel 220comfortable discussing your fears and concerns.26. Do not use drugs or alcohol; these can weaken your ability to stay alert and make good judgments.  7. Be clear, direct and firm. Do not be afraid to say โnoโ or โstop it now.โ  8. Choose your associates wisely. Look for people who are involved in positive activities like educational programs, work opportunities or counseling groups. Get yourself involved in these activities, if they are available at your facility.  9. If you suspect another detainee is being sexually abused or assaulted, report it using one of the methods listed in this pamphlet.  10.Trust your instincts. Be aware of situations that make you feel uncomfortable. If it does not feel right or safe, leave the situation or seek assistance. If you fear for your safety, report your concerns to staff. \nI  \n  ,\n, 4\nIf You Are a Victim of Sexual Abuse orAssault  Whatever your reactions or fears, it is important to understand that you are not to blame. Sexual abuse can violate your sense of safety and trust. You may feel shocked, angry, anxious, depressed, or guilty. You may also experience a variety of physical reactions, from changes in eating and sleeping patterns to nightmares or flashbacks.  These reactions are normal, and help is available. The facility and ICE will help you get support and offer resources specific to your needs.  What Support Can You Expect from ICE and the Facility  You will be offered immediate protection from the cperpetrator and you will be referred for a medical iviCeexamination, when appropriate.

When you report a sexual abuse or assault incident the facility and/or an appropriate law enforcement agency will conduct an investigation. You may beasked to participate in an interview to gather information. ICE will inform you of the result of any investigation once it is completed.  There is a difference between reporting the incident and choosing to press charges. You may choose not toimmediately press charges, but you can always decide to do so later. If criminal charges are filed, it will be presented for possible prosecution. It is important for you to discuss any concerns you have with the prosecutor (or your attorney) or a victim advocate. \ni 1\n \nd 2\nWhat is Sexual Abuse and Assault  Detainee-on-detainee sexual abuse and assault:  All forms of sexual abuse and assault by a detainee against another detainee(s) are prohibited.

Plaintiffs  and \n1 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (SBC) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-MSB     Document 289     Filed 05/06/24     PageID.9987     Page 2\nof 11\n \n1  Counterdefendants Sylvester Owino and Jonathan Gomez (collectively, โPlaintiffsโ) filed \n2  an Opposition to the Motion (โOppโn,โ ECF No. 286), and Defendant filed a Reply \n3  (โReply,โ ECF No. 288).  The Court vacated the hearing on Defendantโs Motion and took \n4  it under submission pursuant to Civil Local Rule 7.1(d)(1).  See ECF No. 287.  Having \n5  carefully considered the Partiesโ arguments, the evidence, and the law, the Court GRANTS \n6  IN PART AND DENIES IN PART Defendantโs Motion.   \n7  BACKGROUND \n8    As the Parties are familiar with the facts, the Court incorporates by reference the \n9  factual and procedural background set forth in this Courtโs April 1, 2020 and November 2, \n10  2023 Orders, and states here only the background relevant to the present Motion.  \n11    This case involves allegations that Defendantโa company that operates detention \n12  facilities for civil immigration detaineesโ(1) violated Californiaโs labor laws with respect \n13  to detaineesโ voluntary work and (2) coerced detainees to perform uncompensated work in \n14  violation of both California and federal law.  ECF No. 179 at 2โ3.  Among other causes of \n15  action, the operative First Amended Complaint (โFACโ) alleges violations of the federal \n16  Trafficking Victims Protection Act (โTVPAโ), 18 U.S.C. ยงยง 1581โ97.  ECF No. 67 at \n17  12โ15.  On April 1, 2020, the Court certified three classes, two of which involve only \n18  California-based detainees.  See ECF No. 179 at 12, 59.  The third class (the โNational \n19  Forced Labor Classโ) includes detainees at all of Defendantโs facilities.  Id.   \n20    This case has been pending for almost seven years.  For much of that time, this case \n21  has been mired in time-consuming discovery.  See, e.g., ECF No. 224 at 7โ9 (describing \n22  Defendantโs estimates of the cost and time burdens associated with class discovery and \n23  noting  that  Defendant  had  โdelay[ed]  in  complying  with  its  discovery  obligationsโ).  \n24  Moreover, this case was stayed in part for approximately two years pending the resolution \n25  of an interlocutory appeal.  ECF Nos. 224, 261.  \n26  The  Parties  are  currently  engaged  in  discovery  relating  to  Defendantโs  non-\n27  California  facilities  and  Plaintiffsโ  federal  TVPA  claim.    See  ECF  No.  284  at  2โ3.  \n28  Defendant represents this discovery will take one year to complete.  Id.  Aside from the \n2 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (SBC) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-MSB     Document 289     Filed 05/06/24     PageID.9988     Page 3\nof 11\n \n1  one-year deadline imposed on this discovery, no scheduling order is currently in place.  See \n2  id. at 3 (requiring the parties to file a status report on February 27, 2025, that includes a \n3  proposed  scheduling  order);  ECF  No.  237  (vacating  pretrial  conference  and  related \n4  deadlines in light of appeal-related stay). \n5    Approximately  one  month  after  United  States  Magistrate  Judge  Steve  B.  Chu \n6  resolved the Partiesโ most recent discovery dispute, Defendant filed the instant Motion.  \n7  Defendant seeks to stay this case in its entirety pending the Ninth Circuitโs rulings in \n8  Nwauzor v. GEO Group, Inc., No. 21-36024, and Washington v. GEO Group, Inc., No. 21-\n9  36025 (collectively, โNwauzorโ).   \n10  LEGAL STANDARD \n11  District courts have โbroad discretionโ to stay actions pending before them.  Clinton \n12  v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681, 706 (1997).  This discretion includes the power to stay an action \n13  pending resolution of independent proceedings if โit is efficient for [the courtโs] own \n14  docket and the fairest course for the parties.โ  Leyva v. Certified Grocers of Cal., 593 F.2d \n15  857, 863 (9th Cir. 1979).  When determining whether a stay is appropriate, courts must \n16  consider (1) โthe possible damage which may result from the granting of a stay,โ (2) โthe \n17  hardship or inequity which a party may suffer in being required to go forward,โ and (3) โthe \n18  simplifying or complicating of issues, proof, and questions of law which could be expected \n19  to result from a stay.โ  CMAX, Inc. v. Hall, 300 F.2d 265, 268 (9th Cir. 1962).  โ[I]f there \n20  is even a fair possibility that the stay for which [the moving party] prays will work damage \n21  to someone else,โ the moving party must โmake out a clear case of hardship or inequity in \n22  being required to go forward.โ  Landis v. N. Am. Co., 299 U.S. 248, 255 (1936).  Moreover, \n23  โ[a] stay should not be granted unless it appears likely the [independent] proceedings will \n24  be concluded within a reasonable time in relation to the urgency of the claims presented to \n25  the court.โ  Leyva, 593 F.2d at 864. \n26  DISCUSSION \n27    In Nwauzor, appellant GEO Group, Inc. (โGEOโ)โa private company operating \n28  detention facilities for civil immigration detaineesโargues that two federal district courts \n3 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (SBC) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-MSB     Document 289     Filed 05/06/24     PageID.9989     Page 4\nof 11\n \n1  erred in concluding that Washington minimum wage law applied to civil immigration \n2  detainees held pursuant to a contract between GEO and the federal government.  Opening \n3  Brief of Defendant-Appellant at 1โ3, Nwauzor v. GEO Grp., Inc., No. 21-36024 (9th Cir. \n4  Mar. 21, 2022), ECF No. 18.  After hearing oral argument, the Ninth Circuit certified \n5  questions of state law to the Washington Supreme Court, Nwauzor, 62 F.4th 509, 516โ17 \n6  (9th Cir. 2023), which the Washington Supreme Court resolved in appelleesโ favor on \n7  January 11, 2023, Nwauzor v. GEO Grp., Inc., 540 P.3d 93, 96 (Wash. 2023).  The \n8  Nwauzor parties and the United States then engaged in supplemental briefing1 on the \n9  application of three constitutional defenses to the plaintiffsโ state law claims: preemption, \n10  intergovernmental immunity, and derivative sovereign immunity.  See Order, Nwauzor, \n11  No. 21-36024 (9th Cir. Mar. 7, 2023), ECF No. 95; Order, Nwauzor, No. 21-36024 (9th \n12  Cir. Feb. 23, 2024), ECF No. 116.  Those same defenses are at issue in this action.   \n13    Per Defendant, considerations of judicial economy support staying this case in its \n14  entirety until the Ninth Circuit issues an opinion in Nwauzor.  Defendant argues that delay \n15  alone does not constitute prejudice to Plaintiffs, Mem. at 7; monetary damages incurred by \n16  class members during the stay are compensable at trial, id. at 8; continued litigation on \n17  state law claims that might be subject to the same defenses at issue in Nwauzor causes \n18  unnecessary hardship, id. at 9; and declining to proceed further at this time preserves \n19  judicial resources, id. at 10.  \n20    Plaintiffs respond that regardless of the outcome in Nwauzor, their federal TVPA \n21  claims will survive.  Oppโn at 1.  Therefore, per Plaintiffs, โthere is no reason why the \n22  claims of the Forced Labor Classes should not proceed at this time.โ  Id. at 3.  They also \n23  contend that (1) they โreasonably expect that the Ninth Circuit will resolve [Nwauzor] \n24  before Plaintiffs can renew their [motion for partial summary judgment as to state law \n25  claims],โ id. at 4; (2) โthere are no pressing deadlines or exigencies in this action weighing \n26 \n \n27 \n1 As supplemental briefing in Nwauzor has only recently concluded, the Ninth Circuit has yet to indicate \n28 \nwhether it will order additional oral argument.   \n4 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (SBC) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-MSB     Document 289     Filed 05/06/24     PageID.9990     Page 5\nof 11\n \n1  in favor of a stay,โ as โall the outstanding [electronically stored information (โESIโ)] \n2  CoreCivic will collect and produce over the next yearโ relates to Plaintiffsโ federal TVPA \n3  claims, id. at 5; and (3) the longer the case drags on, the harder it will be for Plaintiffs to \n4  find relevant information and contact putative class members, id. at 6.   \n5    For the reasons that follow, the Court largely agrees with Plaintiffs.  The Court first \n6  addresses Defendantโs argument that this case should be stayed in its entirety.  The Court \n7  then proceeds Defendantโs alternative request that this action be stayed only as to Plaintiffsโ \n8  state law claims.   \n9  I.  Case as a Whole \n10  A.  Possible Damage to Plaintiffs \n11    Defendant contends delay will not prejudice Plaintiffs because any continuing harm \n12  they face will be redressed by monetary damages.  Mem. at 7.  Not so.  As another court \n13  recognized in a similar case, forced labor causes harms that โare not solely financial.โ  \n14  Novoa v. GEO Grp., Inc., No. EDCV172514JGBSHKX, 2022 WL 2189624, at *2 (C.D. \n15  Cal. Mar. 31, 2022).  And compensation for suffering does not erase suffering.  Regardless \n16  of  whether  class  members  will  receive  monetary  compensation  for  their  continued \n17  exposure to alleged forced labor, the harm associated with said exposure weighs against a \n18  stay.  See id. \n19    Second,  the  Court  is  concerned  regarding  the  impact  of  continued  delay  on \n20  โ[e]vidence,  witness  availability,  and  memory  concerning  the  pertinent  time  frame.โ  \n21  Interwoven, Inc. v. Vertical Comput. Sys., Inc., No. C 10-04645 RS, 2012 WL 761692, at \n22  *3 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 8, 2012).  This case has been pending for seven years.  The longer it \n23  stretches on, the more likely it is that probative evidence will slip out of reach.  This \n24  potential prejudice similarly weighs against a stay.  See In re Morning Song Bird Food \n25  Litig., 320 F.R.D. 540, 543โ45 (S.D. Cal. 2017) (finding, in a case that had been pending \n26  for nearly five years, that continued stay-related delay โwould serve to prejudice Plaintiffโ).   \n27  / / / \n28  / / / \n5 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (SBC) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-MSB     Document 289     Filed 05/06/24     PageID.9991     Page 6\nof 11\n \n1  B.  Hardship to Defendant \n2    Because the Court has found that a stay would wreak possible damage to Plaintiffs, \n3  Defendant must โmake out a clear case of hardship or inequity.โ  Landis, 299 U.S. at 255.  \n4  Defendant has not done so here.  \n5    As this litigation will likely continue in some fashion regardless of the outcome in \n6  Nwauzor, Defendantโs arguments regarding wasteful discovery are entitled to little weight.  \n7  Defendant repeatedly asserts that โ[a]ny one of the constitutional defenses now before the \n8  Ninth Circuit could result in the dismissal of part or all of the claims in this case.โ  Mem. \n9  at 8 (emphasis added).  Yet Defendant fails to explain how the defenses relevant to the \n10  Nwauzor  plaintiffsโ  state  law  claims  would  impact  Plaintiffsโ  federal  TVPA  claim.  \n11  Defendantโs silence in this regard is glaring given (1) its clear explanation of how Nwauzor \n12  would impact Plaintiffsโ state law claims, see Mem. at 9; and (2) Plaintiffsโ express \n13  contention that Nwauzor has โno arguable bearing on the Forced Labor Classes,โ Oppโn. \n14  at 3; see also Novoa, 2022 WL 2189624, at *3 (โ[A]s Plaintiffs note, GEOโs affirmative \n15  defenses  do  not  affect  Plaintiffsโ  federal  TVPA  claims.โ).    As  there  will  likely  โbe \n16  unresolved issues in need of discovery regardless of the outcome of [Nwauzor],โ Defendant \n17  cannot rely on the burden associated with discovery on said issues to justify a stay.  See \n18  Montegna  v.  Ocwen  Loan  Servicing,  LLC,  No.  17-CV-00939-AJB-BLM,  2017  WL \n19  4680168, at *4 (S.D. Cal. Oct. 18, 2017).  \n20    This conclusion is reinforced by the status of discovery.  The only current discovery \n21  deadline in this case involves Defendantโs production of ESI from non-California facilities \n22  โin connection with the TVPA claim of the National Forced Labor Class.โ  Oppโn at 7.  \n23  And Defendant represented that this discovery will take an entire year to complete.  See \n24  ECF No. 284 at 3 (granting Defendantโs request for one year to complete its TVPA-related \n25  discovery obligations).  Thus, until early 2025, Defendant will be engaged in discovery \n26  that Defendant does not dispute will be unaffected by Nwauzor.   \n27  Consequently, Defendant has not shown sufficient hardship to justify a stay of this \n28  action in its entirety. See Montegna, 2017 WL 4680168, at *4 (โ[R]equiring both parties to \n6 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (SBC) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-MSB     Document 289     Filed 05/06/24     PageID.9992     Page 7\nof 11\n \n1  engage in conduct they would unavoidably have to in any event does not warrant an \n2  imposition of a delay that would cause a matter to come to a grinding halt.โ).   \n3  C.  Simplifying and Complicating of Issues \n4    The Court agrees with Defendant thatโas Plaintiffs do not disputeโthe Ninth \n5  Circuitโs opinion in Nwauzor will likely simplify the issues before this court.  Depending \n6  on the outcome, Nwauzor may either demonstrate that Plaintiffsโ state law claims are \n7  barred by one of Defendantโs constitutional defenses or obviate the need for this Court to \n8  consider  Defendantโs  constitutional  defenses.    Based  on  the  current  posture  of  this \n9  litigation, however, it seems likely that the Court will benefit from Nwauzorโs guidance \n10  regardless of whether it stays this case in its entirety.   \n11  A comparison with similar cases is instructive. In Gomez v. GEO Group, Inc., the \n12  court granted a stay where it was faced with a pending motion to dismiss, motion for partial \n13  class certification, and motion for summary judgment, all of which involved issues tied up \n14  in Nwauzor.  No. 122CV00868ADACDB, 2023 WL 4424586, at *1โ2 (E.D. Cal. July 10, \n15  2023).  Rather than spend judicial resources ruling on these pending motions, the Court \n16  stayed the case in its entirety.  Id. at *4.  In Novoa, by contrast, the case was in an advanced \n17  stageโthe court had already certified a class and ruled on cross-motions for summary \n18  judgment.  2022 WL 2189624, at *1.  As all that was left to do in Novoa was trial, judicial \n19  economy again counseled against engaging in lengthy and expensive proceedings that \n20  might give rise to inconsistent or unnecessary rulings.  Id. at *3.   \n21    This case is at a different stage from Gomez and Novoa.  This Court has already \n22  resolved Defendantโs motion to dismiss and has certified multiple classes.  ECF Nos. 38, \n23  179.  And as the Parties are currently engaged in lengthy discovery, see ECF No. 284, there \n24  are  no  approaching dispositive-motion  or  trial deadlines that  threaten  to give  rise  to \n25  inconsistent or unnecessary rulings.  The current absence of such deadlines further weighs \n26  against a stay of this case.   \n27    All three factors weigh against staying this action in its entirety.  The Court therefore \n28  DENIES Defendantโs request to the extent Defendant seeks such a stay. \n7 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (SBC) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-MSB     Document 289     Filed 05/06/24     PageID.9993     Page 8\nof 11\n \n1  II.  Stay as to State Law Claims Only \n2    Though Defendant in its Motion seeks only a stay of this action in its entirety, \n3  Defendant in its Reply asks the Court to โat a minimum . . . stay further proceedings \n4  pertaining to Plaintiffsโ state law claims.โ  Reply at 6โ7.  Defendant first argues that it \n5  would waste judicial resources to issue dispositive rulings on state law claims that might \n6  be mooted by Nwauzor.  Second, Defendant suggests it should not have to bear the expense \n7  of claim-specific discovery that might ultimately prove unnecessary.  Finally, Defendant \n8  contends notice should not be sent to class members whose claims may be dismissed. \n9    The Court will issue a limited stay as to dispositive motions regarding state law \n10  claims potentially subject to the constitutional defenses at issue in Nwauzor.  The Court \n11  agrees that โ[w]aiting for a decision to issue in [Nwauzor] will โavoid exhausting judicial \n12  resources  to  decide . . . summary  judgment  motions . . . which  may  prove  fruitless.โโ  \n13  Gomez, 2023 WL 4424586, at *4.  Indeed, Plaintiffs do not contend that it makes sense for \n14  this Court to rule on state law claims that could well be barred if the Ninth Circuit rules in \n15  favor of GEO Group.  Instead, they argue only that the Ninth Circuit will likely issue its \n16  ruling in Nwauzor before Plaintiffs are able to file their  anticipated partial summary \n17  judgment motion.  Oppโn at 4.  As both Parties agree that the Ninth Circuitโs ruling in \n18  Nwauzor will be relevant to Plaintiffsโ anticipated summary judgment motion, the Court \n19  will stay consideration of any such motion until Nwauzor is decided.  \n20  The Court will not, however, stay discovery related to state law claims.  Defendant \n21  suggests continuing such discovery would be a waste of resources.  Reply at 5โ6.  This \n22  argument ignores, however, that Defendant (1) has had two years to complete only state-\n23  law-specific discovery and (2) has repeatedly sought to delay its discovery obligations \n24  despite the advanced age of this case.  See, e.g., ECF No. 224 at 9, 11 (admonishing \n25  Defendant for โdelaying in complying with its discovery obligationsโ and declining to stay \n26  this case with respect to California-focused discovery pending Defendantโs interlocutory \n27  appeal). \n28  / / / \n8 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (SBC) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-MSB     Document 289     Filed 05/06/24     PageID.9994     Page 9\nof 11\n \n1  Given  the  amount  of  California-focused  discovery  Defendant  has  already \n2  completed2โand  the  extensive  time  the  Parties  have  already  had  to  engage  in  said \n3  discovery3โthe California-focused discovery that remains is unlikely to be sufficiently \n4  burdensome to justify a stay.  And, to the extent Plaintiffs have not yet completed certain \n5  depositions with respect to  state law claims, the risk of loss of evidence due to  the \n6  deteriorating recollections of deponents in this nearly seven-year-old case militates in favor \n7  of allowing said depositions to proceed.  See id. at 9โ10 (denying stay with respect to \n8  California-focused discovery in part because โsome of the relevant information . . . is \n9  known to current and former CoreCivic employees and civil immigration detainees whose \n10  recollections will deteriorateโ).  \n11  The Court is concerned, moreover, regarding Defendantโs apparent assumption that \n12  no discovery save ESI production from non-California facilities will occur until February \n13  27, 2025.  See Reply at 5.  It is not clear to the Court why the Parties cannot simultaneously \n14  produce said ESI and complete other outstanding discovery obligations (e.g., the additional \n15  depositions  anticipated  by  Defendant).    To  ensure  that  both  Parties  are  proceeding \n16  diligently with respect to all outstanding fact discovery, the Parties SHALL FILE a \n17  proposed, fact-discovery specific schedule within twenty-one (21) days of the date of this \n18  Order.  This schedule should reflect good faith efforts by both Parties to complete as much \n19  discovery as possible concurrently with Defendantโs ESI production from non-California \n20  facilities.   \n21    Finally, the Court will not stay notice to class members until Nwuazor is decided.  \n22  As the claims of the National Forced Labor Class are likely to survive regardless of the \n23 \n \n24 \n2 Defendant represents that it has โproduced over 400,000 pages of documents, including ESI from its \n25  California facilities and Stewart Detention Center.โ  ECF No. 279 at 8 n.9. \n \n26  3 The Court has been generous to Defendant with respect to discovery-related extensions and timelines, \nincluding by most recently granting Defendant a year to complete document production from its non-\n27 \nCalifornia facilities.  The Courtโs patience for delay, however, is wearing thin.  Going forward, both \nParties should expect firm, tight deadlines that reflect both the age of this case and the importance of the \n28 \nunderlying claims. \n9 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (SBC) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-MSB     Document 289     Filed 05/06/24     PageID.9995     Page\n10 of 11\n \n1  outcome in Nwauzor, notice to said class should go forward.  Moreover, the National \n2  Forced Labor Class by definition overlaps greatly with the California-specific classes.  See \n3  ECF No. 179 at 12 (defining the National Forced Labor Class to include ICE detainees \n4  detained  at  all  CoreCivic  facilities  between  December  23,  2008,  and  the  present).  \n5  Declining to proceed with notice to the other two classes alongside notice to the National \n6  Forced Labor Class both risks sacrificing cost savings associated with simultaneous notice \n7  and would likely require adjustments to the already-approved class notice plan, see ECF \n8  No. 206 at 1. \n9  True, courts have stayed notice to class members in cases where the Ninth Circuit \n10  grants (or considers granting) a defendantโs petition to appeal class certification under Rule \n11  23(f).  See, e.g., Brown v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., No. 5:09-CV-03339-EJD, 2012 WL \n12  5818300, at *4โ5 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 15, 2012); Farley v. Lincoln Benefit Life Co., No. 2:20-\n13  CV-02485-KJM-DB, 2024 WL 86317, at *4 (E.D. Cal. Jan. 8, 2024).  These courts reason \n14  that if the Ninth Circuit were to reverse or modify the decision certifying the class, a second \n15  curative notice โwould not be sufficient to stem the confusion that would arise.โ  Brown v. \n16  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 2012 WL 5818300, at *4.   \n17  This case, however, is distinguishable.  In Nwauzor, the district courtโs decision to \n18  certify a class of civil immigration detainees is not at issue.  See Defendant-Appellantsโ \n19  Opening Brief, supra, at 1โ3.  Nwauzor is therefore not relevant to whether this Court \n20  properly certified the California-specific classes, but instead to the merits of said classesโ \n21  claims.  As this Court is unlikely to alter its certification decision with respect to the \n22  California-specific classes based on the outcome of Nwauzor, the risk of class-member \n23  confusion associated with pre-Nwauzor notice is minimal.4   \n24 \n25   \n26  4 Defendant points out that if the Parties provide notice to all three classes and the state law claims are \nultimately dismissed, the Parties may then have to bear the cost of a second notice informing class \n27 \nmembers of said dismissal.  Reply at 6.  It is not a given, however, that notice would be required in such \na circumstance.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2), (d)(1)(B); cf. Diaz v. Tr. Territory of Pac. Islands, 876 F.2d \n28 \n1401, 1406 (9th Cir. 1989) (โRule 23(e) notice is not required where the dismissal is involuntary.โ).  And \n10 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (SBC) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-MSB     Document 289     Filed 05/06/24     PageID.9996     Page\n11 of 11\n \n1  As the Court concludes that class notice should proceed in this case, the Parties \n2  SHALL FILE a proposed class-notice schedule within twenty-one (21) days of the date \n3  of this Order.  If possible, the Court expects class notice to proceed concurrently with, \n4  rather than after, Defendantโs current ESI production. \n5  CONCLUSION \n6    In light of the foregoing, the Court GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART \n7  Defendantโs Motion to Stay (ECF No. 285).  The Court STAYS this case with respect to \n8  the filing of dispositive motions involving state law claims subject to the constitutional \n9  defenses at issue in Nwauzor.  The Court otherwise DENIES Defendantโs Motion.  The \n10  Parties SHALL FILE proposed fact-discovery and class notice schedules within twenty-\n11  one (21) days of the date of this Order.   \n12    IT IS SO ORDERED. \n13  Dated:  May 3, 2024   \n14     \n \n15 \n \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n \n27 \neven assuming such notice would be required, the Court is not persuaded that the potential cost of a second \n28 \nnotice justifies delaying initial notices given the age of this case.  \n11 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (SBC) ",

Pending before the Court in \n21  the  related  case  Gonzalez v.  CoreCivic,  Inc., 17-cv-2573-JLS  (NLS),  is a  Motion to \n22  Consolidate the present case (Owino) with Gonzalez.  The Motion to Consolidate is set for \n23  hearing on March 22, 2018.  The Court STAYS the present case until the Motion to \n24  Consolidate is resolved and DEFERS RULING ON Defendantโs Motion to Dismiss. \n25  Courts have the power to stay proceedings sua sponte.  Ali v Trump, 241 F. Supp. 3d \n26  1147, 1152 (W.D. Wash. 2017); Fed. Home Loan Mortg. Corp. v. Karma, No. 14-00137 \n27  ACK-KSC, 2016 WL 922780, at *8โ9 (D. Haw. Mar. 9, 2016).  The issues involved in the \n28  pending proceedings need not be โcontrolling of the action before the courtโ for the court \n1 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 33   Filed 02/16/18   PageID.335   Page 2 of 3\n1  to issue a stay.  Leyva v. Certified Grocers of Cal., Ltd., 593 F.2d 857, 864 (9th Cir. 1979). \n2  Indeed, for a court to issue a stay, the parties in the two cases need not be the same and the \n3  issues need not be identical.  See Landis v. N. Am. Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254 (1936). \n4  In determining whether to grant a motion to stay, โthe competing interests [that] will \n5  be affected by the granting or refusal to grant a stay must be weighed.โ  Lockyer v. Mirant \n6  Corp., 398 F.3d 1098, 1110 (9th Cir. 2005) (citing CMAX, Inc. v. Hall, 300 F.2d 265, 268 \n7  (9th Cir. 1962)).  Those interests include: (1) โthe possible damage which may result from \n8  the granting of a stay,โ (2) โthe hardship or inequity which a party may suffer in being \n9  required to go forward,โ and (3) โthe orderly course of justice measured in terms of the \n10  simplifying or complicating of issues, proof, and questions of law which could be expected \n11  to result from a stay.โ Id.  \n12  Here, as to the first factor, the Court finds no damage to Defendant from  the \n13  imposition of a stay in Owino.  The Court anticipates Defendant will file an opposition to \n14  the Motion to Consolidate in Gonzalez, regardless of whether or not the Court were to rule \n15  on the pending Motion to Dismiss in the present case.  The only damage Defendant faces \n16  is a short delay in the resolution of its Motion to Dismiss.  As to the second factor, the \n17  Court finds no hardship to either party in being required to go forward.  The Motion to \n18  Dismiss is briefed by both Parties and a stay will not harm the Parties.  As to the third \n19  factor, the Court finds the stay may lead to the simplification of issues.  If the Court grants \n20  the Motion to Consolidate, it is logical that Defendant will file a Motion to Dismiss in \n21  Gonzalez, and the present Motion to Dismiss will be moot.  If the Court denies the Motion \n22  to Consolidate, the stay in Owino will be lifted and the Court will rule on the Motion to \n23  Dismiss.  The Court finds the imposition of a stay will promote judicial economy.  It is \n24  logical for the Court to determine whether the two cases will be consolidated before the \n25  Court determines whether one of the cases should be dismissed.  The Court exercises its \n26  inherent power to stay the proceeding in order to promote the efficiency of its docket.  See \n27  Landis, 299 U.S. at 254 (holding a court has the inherent power to stay proceedings in order \n28  โto control the disposition of the causes on its docket with economy of time and effort for \n2 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 33   Filed 02/16/18   PageID.336   Page 3 of 3\n1  itself, for counsel, and for litigants.โ); Levya, 593 F.2d at 863โ64 (โA trial court may, with \n2  propriety, find it is efficient for its own docket and the fairest course for the parties to enter \n3  a stay of an action before it, pending resolution of independent proceedings which bear \n4  upon the case.โ). \n5  CONCLUSION \n6  The Court STAYS the present case and DEFERS RULING on the Motion \n7  to Dismiss, (ECF No. 18), until the Motion to Consolidate is resolved. \n8  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n9 \nDated:  February 16, 2018 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n3 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) ",

CoreCivic has sufficient minimum contacts in California, and  \n8 c.  CoreCivic  has  intentionally  availed  itself  by  participating  in  the \n9 markets  within  California  through  the  sale  and  provision  of  its \n10 services.  \n11 6.  Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391 because:  \n12 a.  Plaintiffs are residents of, and domiciled in, this District,  \n13 b.  Defendant conducts substantial business in this District, and  \n14 c.  a substantial part of the events giving rise to Plaintiffsโ claims alleged \n15 herein occurred in this District.  \n16 PARTIES \n17 7.    Plaintiff Sylvester Owino is a resident of the County of San Diego, in \n18 the State of California.  Mr. Owino was a civil immigration detainee who worked at \n19 CoreCivic's  Otay  Mesa  Detention  Center  at  various  times  from  November  7,  2005 \n20 through March 9, 2015. \n21 8.    Plaintiff Jonathan Gomez is a resident of the County of San Diego, in \n22 the State of California.  Mr. Gomez was a civil immigration detainee who worked at \n23 CoreCivic's Otay Mesa Detention Center at various times from June 14, 2012 through \n24 September 18, 2013. \n25 9.  Defendant CoreCivic, Inc. is a Maryland corporation with its principal place \n26 of business at 10 Burton Hills Blvd., Nashville, Tennessee 37125. \n27 SUMMARY AND COMMON FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n28 10.  Plaintiffs are former civil immigration detainees who bring this proposed \n  -2-\n  Case No. 17-CV-01112-JLS-NLS\n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 67   Filed 10/12/18   PageID.1011   Page 5 of 38\n \n \n1 class action lawsuit on behalf of all civil immigration detainees who were incarcerated \n2 and forced to work by CoreCivic, a for-profit corporation engaged in the business of \n3 owning and operating detention facilities and prisons from January 1, 2004 to the opt-out \n4 date, inclusive (the โClass Periodโ).  \n5 11.  CoreCivic  owns  and  operates  detention  facilities  around  the  country, \n6 including the Otay Mesa Detention Center, a 1,492 bed detention center located in Otay \n7 Mesa, California (the โOtay Facilityโ).  CoreCivic unlawfully forces, coerces, and uses \n8 detainees to clean, maintain, and operate their facility.  In some instances CoreCivic pays \n9 detainees $1 per day, and in other instances detainees are not compensated with wages at \n10 all,  for  their  labor  and  services.    In  2016,  CoreCivic  reported  $1.79  billion  in  total \n11 revenues. \n12 12.  Plaintiffs  seek  injunctive  relief  requiring  CoreCivic  to  implement  and \n13 maintain  policies  and  practices  to  comply  with  all  applicable  laws  and  regulations \n14 designed to protect human rights, prevent and remedy these types of unlawful trafficking \n15 and  forced  labor  practices,  and  protect  detainees'  employment  rights,  well-being  and \n16 safety,  as  well  as  restitution,  damages,  statutory  remedies,  disgorgement,  and  other \n17 further relief this Court may deem proper. \n18 13.  Plaintiffs also seek to recover, inter alia, on their own behalf and on behalf \n19 of all others similarly situated, the difference between the fair value of the labor or work \n20 they performed and what they were paid (i.e., the $1 per day).  CoreCivic violated federal \n21 law prohibiting forced labor when CoreCivic forced, coerced, and used Plaintiffs and \n22 others to work for no pay, cleaning the โpodsโ where they were housed, and cleaning, \n23 maintaining, and operating other areas of the CoreCivic detention facilities under threat \n24 of punishment, including lockdown and solitary confinement.  \n25 14.  Plaintiffs were engaged, suffered, and permitted to work by CoreCivic at, \n26 without  limitation,  the  Otay  Facility.    CoreCivic  controlled  the  wages,  hours,  and \n27 working  conditions  of  Plaintiffs.    In  the  course  of  their  labor  and  employment  by \n28 CoreCivic, Plaintiffs and other putative class members, without limitation: \n  -3-\n  Case No. 17-CV-01112-JLS-NLS\n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 67   Filed 10/12/18   PageID.1012   Page 6 of 38\n \n \n1 a.  scrubbed bathrooms, showers, toilets, and windows;  \n2 b.  cleaned and maintained CoreCivicโs on-site medical facility;  \n3 c.  cleaned the medical facilityโs toilets, floors, and windows;  \n4 d.  cleaned patient rooms and medical staff offices;  \n5 e.  swept, mopped, stripped, and waxed the floors of the medical facility;  \n6 f.  washed medical facility laundry;  \n7 g.  swept, mopped, stripped, and waxed floors throughout the facility;  \n8 h.  washed detainee laundry;  \n9 i.  prepared and served detainee meals;  \n10 j.  assisted  in  preparing  catered  meals  for  law  enforcement  events \n11 sponsored by CoreCivic;  \n12 k.  performed clerical work for CoreCivic;   \n13 l.  prepared clothing for newly arriving detainees;  \n14 m.  provided barber services to detainees;  \n15 n.  ran and managed the law library;  \n16 o.  cleaned intake areas and solitary confinement unit;  \n17 p.  cleaned and prepared vacant portions of the facility for newly arriving \n18 detainees;   \n19 q.  cleaned the facilityโs warehouse; and   \n20 r.  maintained the exterior and landscaping of the CoreCivic buildings. \n21 15.  Detainees who โvolunteeredโ for such work were paid $1 per day.  The \n22 foregoing labor and services for which detainees were paid $1 per day are referred to \n23 herein as the โDollar-A-Day Work.โ  In addition, Plaintiffs and detainees are/were only \n24 allowed to spend their $1 per day at the CoreCivic โcompany storeโ or commissary.   \n25 CoreCivicโs Unlawful Labor and Human Trafficking Practices \n26 16.  In  addition  to  the  Dollar-A-Day  Work,  CoreCivic  forced  and  coerced \n27 Plaintiffs and members of the putative class, to clean, maintain, scrub, sweep, and mop \n28 floors, bathrooms, showers, toilets, and windows for no pay at all, not only in their living \n  -4-\n  Case No. 17-CV-01112-JLS-NLS\n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 67   Filed 10/12/18   PageID.1013   Page 7 of 38\n \n \n1 areas (โpodsโ), but also throughout the other interior and exterior areas of CoreCivicโs \n2 detention facilities by threatening to punish not only those who refused to work, but also \n3 other detainees in the pods with confinement, physical restraint, substantial and sustained \n4 restriction, deprivation, and violation of their liberty, and solitary confinement, all with \n5 the intent to obtain forced labor or services and as punishment for any refusal to work \n6 causing Plaintiffs severe mental pain and suffering.   The foregoing forced and coerced \n7 labor  and  services  under  threat  of  punishment,  confinement,  physical  restraint,  and \n8 deprivation of liberty for which Detainees were paid nothing at all are referred to herein \n9 as the โForced Labor.โ \n10 17.  Defendant  paid  Plaintiffs  and  all  its  other  civil  immigration  detainee-\n11 employees one dollar ($1) per day for Dollar-A-Day Work and nothing at all for their \n12 Forced Labor and acted with malice, oppression, fraud, and duress in committing the \n13 foregoing acts.  As a result of Defendantโs violations of the law, CoreCivic was unjustly \n14 enriched. \n15 Federal and State Trafficking Victims Protection Acts \n16 18.  As  a  result  of  the  foregoing,  Defendant  violated  federal  law  prohibiting \n17 forced labor. 18 U.S.C. ยง 1589.  In addition, Defendant violated California law prohibit \n18 human trafficking and forced labor.  Civ. Code ยง 52.5.  Plaintiffs seek actual damages, \n19 compensatory  damages,  punitive  damages,  treble  damages,  injunctive  relief,  and \n20 mandatory restitution on their own behalf and on behalf of all Defendantโs other similarly \n21 situated detainees, as well as attorneysโ fees and costs, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. ยงยง 1593 and \n22 1595 and Cal. Civ. Code ยง 52.5(a).  Plaintiffs also seeks the greater of treble damages or \n23 ten thousand ($10,000) pursuant to Cal. Civ. Code ยง 52.5(b). \n24 19.  Plaintiffs and the putative class members have suffered, and are continuing \n25 to suffer, real-world, actual, concrete harm by, without limitation, Defendant's use of \n26 Forced  Labor  and  human  trafficking,  violations  of  applicable  labor  laws  and  orders, \n27 unfair and unlawful business practices, and negligence.  The putative class members are \n28 presently  facing  the  same  imminent  real,  actual,  and  concrete  harm  and  injury  from \n  -5-\n  Case No. 17-CV-01112-JLS-NLS\n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 67   Filed 10/12/18   PageID.1014   Page 8 of 38\n \n \n1 CoreCivicโs illegal conduct and its failure to redress the harm.  \n2 20.  The  total  number  of  civil  immigration  detainees  who  were  subjected  to \n3 Defendant's  Forced  Labor  and  human  trafficking  practices,  and  Defendant's  illegal \n4 Dollar-A-Day Work practices is currently unknown, but these illegal practices appear \n5 endemic to the Core-Civic operations on a California-wide, and indeed a nationwide, \n6 scale.  However,  Core-Civic  can  provide  the  information  regarding  how  many  civil \n7 immigration  detainees  were  subjected  to  these  illegal  practices  through  its  solitary \n8 confinement and detention logs and also through its business records. \n9 21.  CoreCivic  has  been  wrongly  and  unjustly  enriched  by  its  use  of  Forced \n10 Labor and human trafficking practices, Dollar-A-Day Work practices, unlawful business \n11 practices, and the retention of such revenues and profits resulting therefrom is grossly \n12 unfair.  CoreCivic should not be allowed to retain the revenues, proceeds, profits and \n13 other benefits conferred upon it by Plaintiffs and the putative class members.   \n14 22.  Defendantโs unlawful conduct complained of herein constitutes a continuing \n15 pattern and course of conduct as opposed to unrelated discrete acts.  Defendantโs pattern \n16 and course of conduct has continued from November 2, 2004 until the present and is a \n17 continuing violation since that date.  Neither Plaintiffs nor the Class Members were/are \n18 aware of or discovered their legal rights or claims, or could have discovered with any \n19 amount of reasonable diligence, the true facts regarding their claims until the present.  \n20 Plaintiffs  and  the  Class  Members  were/are  ignorant  of  the  true  facts  regarding \n21 Defendantโs unlawful and illegal acts, and lacked the ability to have earlier discovered \n22 the true facts, until the present due to false statements made by Defendant regarding the \n23 legality of their False Labor and Dollar-A-Day Work practices.  Discovery of the true \n24 facts  did  not  actually  occur,  and  could  not  have  occurred,  until  after  any  applicable \n25 statutes of limitations. \n26 The For-Profit Detention Industry \n27 23.  Throughout the country, undocumented individuals lacking legal permission \n28 to enter or remain in the United States are typically brought to a detention facility and \n  -6-\n  Case No. 17-CV-01112-JLS-NLS\n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 67   Filed 10/12/18   PageID.1015   Page 9 of 38\n \n \n1 placed in removal proceedings in front of an immigration judge. These individuals may \n2 include refugees seeking asylum. Individuals detained at the border are only released on a \n3 case-by-case  basis  by  the  authority  of  U.S.  Bureau  of  Immigration  and  Customs \n4 Enforcement (โICEโ) officials. \n5 24.  ICE  uses  a  combination  of  publicly  and  privately  owned  and  operated \n6 facilities to detain immigrants. Those in detention include immigrants in the country \n7 illegally, asylum seekers, green card holders, and those awaiting immigration hearings \n8 (referred  to  herein  as  a  โdetaineeโ  or  civil  immigration  detaineeโ).    Nine  (9)  of  the \n9 countryโs  ten  (10)  largest  immigration  detention  facilities  are  operated  by  private \n10 companies  like  CoreCivic,  and  they  hold  about  two-thirds  of  the  civil  immigration \n11 detainees in a system that currently keeps more than 31,000 people in custody on a \n12 typical day. \n13 25.  The for-profit civil immigration detention business is worth over $3 billion \n14 dollars a year.  While some centers are located in border areas, others are far from the \n15 border because deportation officers arrest migrants living in the interior of the country as \n16 well.  Although they have denied lobbying, private prison corporations such as Core-\n17 Civic specifically target legislators over immigration โreform.โ The companies' success \n18 in lobbying for immigrant detention has been so successful that by 2015, CoreCivic \n19 derived 51% of its revenue from federal contracts. \n20 26.  In March of 2017 it was announced that the United States' civil immigrant \n21 detention capacity would be increased by over four-hundred fifty per cent (450%). This \n22 signals the largest increase in immigrant detention since World War II and is, in essence, \n23 a โget into jail and work for free cardโ from which Defendant derives nearly $1 billion \n24 dollars a year in revenue. \n25 PLAINTIFFโS EXPERIENCE \n26 27.  Plaintiff Sylvester Owino is a resident of the county San Diego, in the State \n27 of California.  Mr. Owino was a detainee at CoreCivic's Otay Facility from November 7, \n28 2005 through March 9, 2015.  During the Class Period, Mr. Owino performed Dollar-A-\n  -7-\n  Case No. 17-CV-01112-JLS-NLS\n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 67   Filed 10/12/18   PageID.1016   Page 10 of 38\n \n \n1 Day Work for $1 per day in an unsafe work environment and was forced and coerced to \n2 perform Forced Labor at, without limitation, the Otay Facility. \n3 28.  Plaintiff Owino was employed by CoreCivic to provide labor and services in \n4 an unsafe working environment  cleaning  and  maintaining  CoreCivic's  on-site  medical \n5 facility without personal protective equipment (โPPEโ).  PPE is special equipment worn \n6 to  create  a  barrier  between  health  care  workers  and  germs.  This  barrier  reduces  the \n7 chance of touching, being exposed to, and spreading germs and helps protect people from \n8 infections caused by contact with blood or other bodily fluids. \n9 29.  Plaintiff Jonathan Gomez is a resident of San Diego, California and the \n10 county of San Diego who formerly was a detainee at the Otay Facility from June 14, \n11 2012 through September 18, 2013.  During the Class Period, Mr. Gomez performed \n12 Dollar-A-Day Work for $1 per day in an unsafe work environment and was forced and \n13 coerced to perform Forced Labor at the Otay Facility. \n14 CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n15 30.  Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 on \n16 behalf of themselves and all members of the โForced Labor Class,โ preliminarily defined \n17 as: \n18 The Nationwide Forced Labor Class \n \n19 All  civil  immigration  detainees  who  performed  Forced  Labor \nuncompensated  work  for  CoreCivic  at  any  Detention  Facility  owned  or \n20 operated by it between November 2, 2004 to the applicable opt-out date, \ninclusive. \n21\n22 Such persons are collectively referred to herein individually as a โNationwide Forced \n23 Labor  Class  Memberโ  and  collectively  as  the  โNationwide  Forced  Labor  Classโ  or \n24 โNationwide Forced Labor Class Members.โ \n25 The California Forced Labor Class \n \n26 All  civil  immigration  detainees  who  performed  Forced  Labor \nuncompensated  work  for  CoreCivic  at  any  Detention  Facility  located  in \n27 California owned or operated by it at time during the period from November \n2, 2004 to the applicable op-out date, inclusive.   \n28\n  -8-\n  Case No. 17-CV-01112-JLS-NLS\n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 67   Filed 10/12/18   PageID.1017   Page 11 of 38\n \n \n1 Such  persons  are  collectively  referred  to  herein  individually  as  a  โCalifornia  Forced \n2 Labor  Class  Memberโ  and  collectively  as  the  โCalifornia  Forced  Labor  Classโ  or \n3 โCalifornia Forced Labor Class Members.โ \n4 The California Labor Law Class \n \n5 All  civil  immigration  detainees  who  performed  Dollar-A-Day  Work  for \nCoreCivic and were paid one dollar ($1) per day at any Detention Facility \n6 located in California owned or operated by it at any time between November \n2, 2004 to the applicable op-out date, inclusive. \n7\n8 Such persons are collectively referred to herein individually as a โCalifornia Labor Law \n9 Class Memberโ and collectively as the โCalifornia Labor Law Class.โ \n10 31.  The Classes described in this First Amended Complaint (โFACโ) may be \n11 jointly referred to as the โClassโ and proposed Members of the Classes may be jointly \n12 referred to as โClass Members.โ \n13 32.  Excluded from the Class are the Defendant herein, law enforcement agencies \n14 and personnel, members of the foregoing personsโ immediate families and their legal \n15 representatives, heirs, successors, or assigns, and any entity or person in which Defendant \n16 has or had a controlling or supervisory interest or control over at all relevant times. \n17 33.  Plaintiffs  satisfy  the  numerosity,  commonality,  typicality,  adequacy,  and \n18 predominance prerequisites for suing as representative parties pursuant to Rule 23 of the \n19 Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n20 34.  Numerosity.  The exact number of proposed Class Members is currently not \n21 known, but is believed to consist of thousands if not tens of thousands of former or \n22 current CoreCivic detainees who have been forced and/or coerced to work, whether for \n23 one dollar ($1) per day or no pay whatsoever, making joinder of each individual Class \n24 Member impracticable. \n25 35.  Commonality.  Common questions of law and fact exist for the proposed \n26 Classโ claims and predominate over questions affecting only individual Class Members.  \n27 Common questions include, without limitation: \n28 a.  whether  Plaintiffs  and  the  Class  Members  were  entitled  to  the \n  -9-\n  Case No. 17-CV-01112-JLS-NLS\n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 67   Filed 10/12/18   PageID.1018   Page 12 of 38\n \n \n1 protections  of  the  California  labor  laws  and  California  Industrial \n2 Welfare Commission wage orders; \n3 b.  whether  Plaintiffs  and  the  Class  Members  performed  compensable \n4 work; \n5 c.  whether Plaintiffs and the Class Members were paid $1 per day for \n6 their labor;  \n7 d.  whether forcing and coercing Plaintiffs and the Class Members to \n8 perform Forced Labor constitutes a violation of each Class Memberโs \n9 TVPA and CTVPA, human rights, California labor law and California \n10 Industrial Welfare Commission wage orders, and other statutory and \n11 common law rights as set forth herein; \n12 e.  what monitoring, limiting, and supervisory procedures and practices \n13 should  CoreCivic  be  required  to  implement  to  ensure  ongoing \n14 protection of each Class Memberโs TVPA, CTVPA, California labor \n15 law,  and  other  legal  rights  and  as  part  of  any  prohibitory  and \n16 mandatory injunctive relief ordered by the Court; \n17 f.  whether CoreCivic acted deliberately or negligently by unlawfully, \n18 without limitation: \n19 i.  failing to adequately protect Class Members TVPA, CTVPA, \n20 and California labor law rights \n21 ii.  forcing and coercing detainees to perform Forced Labor;  \n22 iii.  failing to follow applicable laws; and  \n23 iv.  failing  to  maintain  adequate  monitoring,  limiting,  and \n24 supervisory procedures, policies, and practices; and \n25 g.  whether  Plaintiffs  and  Class  Members  may  obtain  damages, \n26 restitution, disgorgement, declaratory, and prohibitory and mandatory \n27 injunctive relief against CoreCivic. \n28 36.  Typicality.  Plaintiffsโ claims are typical of the claims of the proposed Class \n  -10-\n  Case No. 17-CV-01112-JLS-NLS\n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 67   Filed 10/12/18   PageID.1019   Page 13 of 38\n \n \n1 because, among other things, Plaintiffs and Class Members legal claims all arise from \n2 CoreCivicโs  unlawful  practices,  and  Plaintiffs  and  Class  members  sustained  similar \n3 injuries and statutory damages as a result of CoreCivicโs uniform illegal conduct.  \n4 37.  Adequacy.  Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \n5 Class.    Their  interests  do  not  conflict  with  Class  Membersโ  interests  and  they  have \n6 retained counsel competent and experienced in complex and class action litigation to \n7 vigorously prosecute this action on behalf of the Class.  In addition to satisfying the \n8 prerequisites of FRCP 23(a), Plaintiffs satisfy the requirements for maintaining a class \n9 action under FRCP 23(b)(2) and (3).  \n10 38.  Common questions of law and fact predominate over any questions affecting \n11 only individual Class Members and a Class action is superior to individual litigation \n12 because:  \n13 a.  the  amount  of  damages  available  to  individual  Plaintiffs  are \n14 insufficient  to  make  litigation  addressing  CoreCivicโs  conduct \n15 economically feasible in the absence of the Class action procedure; \n16 b.  individualized litigation would present a potential for inconsistent or \n17 contradictory judgments, and increases the delay and expense to all \n18 parties and the court system; and \n19 c.  the Class action device presents far fewer management difficulties and \n20 provides the benefits of a single adjudication, economy of scale, and \n21 comprehensive supervision by a single court. \n22 39.  In addition, Class certification is appropriate under FRCP Rule 23(b)(1) or \n23 (b)(2) because: \n24 a.  the prosecution of separate actions by the individual Members of the \n25 proposed  Class  would  create  a  risk  of  inconsistent  or  varying \n26 adjudication which would establish incompatible standards of conduct \n27 for CoreCivic; \n28 b.  the  prosecution  of  separate  actions  by  individual  Class  Members \n  -11-\n  Case No. 17-CV-01112-JLS-NLS\n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 67   Filed 10/12/18   PageID.1020   Page 14 of 38\n \n \n1 would  create  a  risk  of  adjudications  with  respect  to  them  which \n2 would, as a practical matter, be dispositive of the interests of other \n3 Class Members not parties to the adjudications, or substantially impair \n4 or impede their ability to protect their interests; and \n5 c.  CoreCivic has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally \n6 to  the  proposed  Class,  thereby  making  final  injunctive  relief  or \n7 declaratory  relief  described  herein  appropriate  with  respect  to  the \n8 proposed Class as a whole. \n9 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n10 Violation of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act \n11 18 U.S.C. ยงยง 1589, et seq. \n12 (On Behalf of the Plaintiffs Individually and the Class) \n13 40.  Plaintiffs  and  Class  Members  incorporate  by  reference  the  foregoing \n14 allegations.  \n15 41.  18  U.S.C.  ยง  1589(a)  of  the  Federal  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Act \n16 provides that:  \n17\nโWhoever knowingly provides or obtains the labor or services of a person by any one \n18 of, or by any combination of, the following means โ (1) by means of force, threats of \nforce,  physical  restraint,  or  threats  of  physical  restraint  to  that  person  or  another \n19\nperson; (2) by means of serious harm or threats of serious harm to that person or \n20 another person; (3) by means of the abuse or threatened abuse of law or legal process; \nor (4) by means of any scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause the person to believe \n21\nthat, if that person did not perform such labor or services, that person or another \n22 person would suffer serious harm or physical restraint, shall be punished as provided \nunder [18 U.S.C. ยง 1589] subsection (d).โ \n23\n42.  Plaintiffs and Class Members were forced, coerced, and made to perform \n24\nlabor and services, including Forced Labor, for CoreCivic by means of:  \n25\na.  force,  threats  of  force,  physical  restraint  and  threats  of  physical \n26\nrestraint; \n27\nb.  serious harm and threats of serious harm; and  \n28\n  -12-\n  Case No. 17-CV-01112-JLS-NLS\n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 67   Filed 10/12/18   PageID.1021   Page 15 of 38\n \n \n1 c.  abuse and threatened abuse of law or legal process to Plaintiffs and \n2 the Class Members, and by means of a scheme, plan, pattern, and \n3 uniform policy intended to cause Plaintiffs and the Class to believe \n4 that, if they did not perform such labor or services, that they would \n5 suffer serious harm and/or physical restraint.   \n6 CoreCivic  was  unjustly  enriched  by  the  unlawful  practice  of  forcing  and  coercing \n7 Plaintiffs  and  the  Class  Members  to  perform  uncompensated  Forced  Labor  through \n8 human  trafficking.

See Brinker, 53 Cal. 4th 1004 at 1029 (โEmployees are entitled to \n15 10 minutes rest for shifts three and one-half to six hours in length, 20 minutes for shifts \n16 of more than six hours up to 10 hours; 30 minutes for shifts of more than 10 hours up to \n17 14 hours, and so on.โ). \n18 86.  Because  CoreCivic  failed  to  provide  proper  rest  periods,  it  is  liable  to \n19 Plaintiffs and Class Members for one (1) hour of additional pay at the regular rate of \n20 compensation for each workday that the proper rest periods were not provided, pursuant \n21 to Cal.

As a pattern and practice, in violation of Labor Code ยง 226(a), CoreCivic did \n14 not  provide  Plaintiffs  or  Class  Members  with  accurate  itemized  wage  statements  in \n15 writing showing:  \n16 a.  all applicable hourly rates in effect during each respective pay period \n17 and the corresponding number of hours worked by each respective \n18 individual;  \n19 b.  number of hours worked;  \n20 c.  gross wages earned;  \n21 d.  net wages earned;  \n22 e.  all deductions;  \n23 f.  inclusive dates of the period for which the employee is paid;  \n24 g.  the employee identification or social security number; and  \n25 h.  the address of the legal entity that is the employer. \n26 90.  As  a  result  of  CoreCivic's  failure  to  provide  accurate  itemized  wages \n27 statements, Plaintiffs and Class Members suffered actual damages and harm by being \n28 unable to determine their applicable hourly rate or the amount of overtime worked for \n  -24-\n  Case No. 17-CV-01112-JLS-NLS\n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 67   Filed 10/12/18   PageID.1033   Page 27 of 38\n \n \n1 each pay period, which prevented them from becoming aware of these violations and \n2 asserting their statutory protections under California law. \n3 91.  CoreCivic has knowingly and intentionally failed to comply with Cal. Labor \n4 Code ยง 226(a) and failed to provide a wage statement to Plaintiffs and Class Members. \n5 92.  Pursuant to Cal. Labor Code ยง 226(e), the Plaintiffs and Class Members are \n6 entitled to recover the greater of all actual damages or fifty dollars ($50.00) for the initial \n7 pay period in which a violation occurs and one hundred dollars ($100.00) per employee \n8 for each violation in a subsequent pay period, not exceeding an aggregate penalty of four \n9 thousand dollars ($4,000.00). \n10 93.  The  Plaintiffs  and  Class  Members  are  entitled  to  an  award  of  costs  and \n11 reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to Cal. Labor Code ยง 226(h). \n12 NINTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n13 Failure to Pay Compensation Upon Termination/Waiting Time Penalties  \n14 Cal. Labor Code ยงยง 201-203 \n15 (On behalf of Plaintiffs Individually and the California Labor Law Class) \n16 94.  Plaintiffs and Class Members incorporate the above allegations by reference. \n17 95.  California  Labor  Code  ยงยง  201  and  202  require  CoreCivic  to  pay  all \n18 compensation  due  and  owing  to  Plaintiffs  and  Class  Members  immediately  upon \n19 discharge or within seventy-two hours of their termination of employment. Cal. Labor \n20 Code ยง 203 provides that if an employer willfully fails to pay compensation promptly \n21 upon discharge or resignation, as required by ยงยง 201 and 202, then the employer is liable \n22 for such โwaiting timeโ penalties in the form of continued compensation up to thirty \n23 workdays. \n24 96.  CoreCivic willfully failed to pay Plaintiffs and Class Members who are no \n25 longer employed by CoreCivic compensation due upon termination as required by Cal. \n26 Labor Code ยงยง 201 and 202. As a result, CoreCivic is liable to Plaintiffs and former \n27 employee Class Members waiting time penalties provided under Cal.

Labor Code ยง 432.5 \n4 (On behalf of Plaintiffs Individually and the California Labor Law Class) \n5 97.  Plaintiffs and Class Members incorporate the above allegations by reference. \n6 98.  Cal.  Labor  Code  ยง  432.5  provides  that  no  employer  shall  require  any \n7 employee to agree, in writing, to any term or condition which is known by the employer \n8 to be prohibited by law. \n9 99.  CoreCivic requires, as a condition of employment, that Plaintiffs and Class \n10 Members sign a written agreement which includes numerous terms that are prohibited by \n11 law, including but not limited to agreeing to work for less than minimum wage or without \n12 appropriate overtime compensation. \n13 100.  Provisions of the employment contract, as described above, that Plaintiffs \n14 and Class Members were required to sign as a condition of employment, explicitly and \n15 unquestionably,  violate  several  provisions  of  California  law  and  public  policy.  Upon \n16 information and belief, CoreCivic knew that such provisions violated California law and \n17 public policy. \n18 101.  As a result of Defendant's unlawful conduct as alleged herein, Plaintiffs and \n19 Class Members have sustained damages. \n20 ELEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n21 Negligence \n22 (On Behalf of Plaintiffs Individually and the Class) \n23 102.  Plaintiffs  and  the  Class  Members  incorporate  the  above  allegations  by \n24 reference. \n25 103.  In engaging Plaintiffs and the Class members to provide labor and services \n26 to  CoreCivic,  CoreCivic  owed  a  duty  to  exercise  reasonable  and  ordinary  care  in \n27 complying with all applicable local, state, and federal laws and to furnish a safe working \n28 place for its employees.  \n  -26-\n  Case No. 17-CV-01112-JLS-NLS\n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 67   Filed 10/12/18   PageID.1035   Page 29 of 38\n \n \n1 104.  This  duty  included,  among  other  things,  taking  reasonable  measures  to \n2 implement and maintain reasonable procedures to provide a safe working environment \n3 and workplace and to protect the rights of Class Members in compliance with applicable \n4 law, including, but not limited to procedures and policies:   \n5 a.  to supervise, restrict, limit, and determine whether any Plaintiffs and \n6 the  Class  Members  were  subject  to  Forced  Labor  practices  by \n7 CoreCivic  or  perform  other  labor  and  services  under  threat  of \n8 punishment,  confinement,  physical  restraint,  and  deprivation  of \n9 liberty;  \n10 b.  to notify Plaintiffs and the Class Members of their rights under the \n11 TVPA and CTVPA; and  \n12 c.  when  and  how  to  notify  Plaintiffs  and  the  Class  Members  of \n13 CoreCivic's unlawful Forced Labor practices.  \n14 105.  In providing services to the Plaintiffs and the Class, CoreCivic owed them a \n15 duty to exercise reasonable care, without limitation in:  \n16 a.  adequately providing a safe working environment and workplace;  \n17 b.  adequately protecting the rights of Class Members in compliance with \n18 applicable law;  \n19 c.  prohibiting and adequately ensuring Plaintiffs and the Class Members \n20 were not subject to Forced Labor practices;  \n21 d.  adequately ensuring Plaintiffs and the Class Members had a safe work \n22 environment; and  \n23 e.  protecting the rights of Plaintiffs and the Classโ under the TVPA and \n24 CTVPA from CoreCivic's Forced Labor practices.   \n25 106.  CoreCivicโ systems, policies, and procedures for adequately ensuring the \n26 rights of Plaintiffs and the Class Members under the TVPA and CTVPA were adequately \n27 protected were intended to, and did, affect Plaintiffs and the Class Members.  CoreCivic \n28 was aware that by utilizing Plaintiffs' and the Class Members labor and services, it had a \n  -27-\n  Case No. 17-CV-01112-JLS-NLS\n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 67   Filed 10/12/18   PageID.1036   Page 30 of 38\n \n \n1 responsibility to take reasonable measures to protect their rights under applicable law. \n2 107.  The duty CoreCivic owed to Plaintiffs and Class Members to protect their \n3 rights under applicable law is underscored by the Federal  and California Trafficking \n4 Victims  Protection  Act,  which  recognizes  the  importance  of  preventing  the  crime  of \n5 trafficking of a person for forced labor or services. \n6 108.  Additionally,  CoreCivic  had  a  duty  to  timely  disclose  to  and/or  warn \n7 Plaintiffs and Class Members of their rights under the TVPA, CTVPA, California labor \n8 laws, and other applicable laws, rules, and regulations.  Timely disclosure was necessary \n9 and appropriate so that Plaintiffs and Class Members could have, among other things, \n10 timely pursued and exhausted available remedies, and undertaken appropriate measures \n11 to avoid, prevent or mitigate the violations of their rights under applicable laws. \n12 109.  There  is  a  very  close  connection  between  CoreCivicโs  failure  to  take \n13 reasonable  measures  to  provide  a  safe  and  lawful  work  environment  and  timely \n14 disclosure of Plaintiffs' and the Class Members' rights and the injury to Plaintiffs and the \n15 Class.   \n16 110.  When individuals have their human and labor law rights violated they are at \n17 risk for personal, financial, physical, and emotional injury, distress, and damage and need \n18 to incur additional costs and expense to protect themselves and seek and obtain redress \n19 from such invasions of their legal rights. \n20 111.  CoreCivic is legally responsible for such unlawful violations of Plaintiffs \n21 and the Class Members' human and labor law rights and their right to a safe working \n22 environment because it failed to take reasonable measures in connection therewith.  If \n23 CoreCivic  had  taken  reasonable  measures  in  connection  with  their  employment  of \n24 Plaintiffs and the Class Members, their legal rights would not have been violated. \n25 112.  The policy of preventing future harm weighs in favor of finding a special \n26 relationship between CoreCivic and the Class. CoreCivicโs civil immigration detainees \n27 have no choice to but to perform the Forced Labor when and how CoreCivic demands it.  \n28 If CoreCivic is not held accountable for failing to take reasonable measures to protect the \n  -28-\n  Case No. 17-CV-01112-JLS-NLS\n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 67   Filed 10/12/18   PageID.1037   Page 31 of 38\n \n \n1 human rights and labor law rights of its detainees, they will not take the steps that are \n2 necessary to protect against future invasions of such rights. \n3 113.  It was foreseeable that if CoreCivic did not take reasonable measures, the \n4 human rights and labor law rights of Plaintiffs and Members of the Class would be \n5 violated. CoreCivic should have known to take precautions to prevent such abuses. \n6 114.  CoreCivic breached its duty to exercise reasonable care in providing a safe \n7 work environment for, and protecting the human rights and labor law rights of, Plaintiffs \n8 and the Class Members by, without limitation:   \n9 a.  failing  to  implement  and  maintain adequate  measures  to  safeguard \n10 detainees' rights;  \n11 b.  failing to monitor its operations to identify unlawful activity;  \n12 c.  requiring and/or allowing Plaintiffs and the Class to work in an unsafe \n13 environment; and  \n14 d.  failing to otherwise prevent human rights and labor law abuses. \n15 115.  CoreCivic breached its duty to timely warn or notify Plaintiffs and the Class \n16 about  its  unlawful  Forced  Labor  and  โDollar-A-Day  Workโ  practices  and  programs.  \n17 CoreCivic has failed to issue any warnings to its current and former detainees affected by \n18 these unlawful practices.  Additionally, CoreCivic was, or should have been, aware of its \n19 unlawful practices as early as November 2, 2004. \n20 116.  But for CoreCivicโs failure to implement and maintain adequate measures to \n21 provide a safe working environment for, and protect the human rights and labor law \n22 rights of, Plaintiffs and the Class Members, and its failure to monitor its operations to \n23 identify unlawful Forced Labor and Dollar-A-Day Work violations of the labor laws, \n24 Plaintiffs' and Class Members' rights would not have been violated and Class Members \n25 would  not  be  at  a  heightened  risk  of  unlawful  Forced  Labor  and  other  labor  law \n26 violations in the future. \n27 117.  CoreCivicโs negligence was a substantial factor in causing harm to Plaintiffs \n28 and Class Members, and in violating their human rights and labor law rights.  As a direct \n  -29-\n  Case No. 17-CV-01112-JLS-NLS\n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 67   Filed 10/12/18   PageID.1038   Page 32 of 38\n \n \n1 and proximate cause and result of CoreCivicโ failure to exercise reasonable care and use \n2 reasonable measures to provide a safe working environment and safeguard the human \n3 rights and labor law rights of Plaintiffs and the Class Members, Plaintiffs and the Class \n4 Members were subjected to Forced Labor and the labor law violations set forth herein. \n5 Class Members face a heightened risk of such unlawful practices in the future. \n6 118.  Neither  Plaintiffs  nor  other  Class  Members  contributed  to  the  unlawful \n7 conduct set forth herein, nor did they contribute to CoreCivicโs unlawful Forced Labor \n8 practices and other labor law violations, nor to the insufficient measures to provide a safe \n9 working environment and to safeguard the human rights and labor law rights of Plaintiffs \n10 and the Class Members. \n11 119.  Plaintiffs  and  the  Class  Members  seek  compensatory  damages  and \n12 exemplary damages with pre-and-post judgment interest, the costs of suit, attorneysโ fees, \n13 and other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper. \n14 TWELFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n15 Unjust Enrichment \n16 (On Behalf of Plaintiffs Individually and the Class) \n120.  Plaintiffs  and  the  Class  Members  incorporate  the  above  allegations  by \n17\nreference. \n18\n121.  โUnder California law, the elements of unjust enrichment are: (a) receipt of a \n19\nbenefit; and (b) unjust retention of the benefit at the expense of another.โ  Valencia v. \n20\nVolkswagen Grp. of Am. Inc., No. 15-CV-00887-HSG, 2015 WL 4747533, at *8 (N.D. \n21\nCal. Aug. 11, 2015). See also, Munoz v. MacMillan, 195 Cal.

App. 4th 333, 346 (2008). \n6 123.  Plaintiffs  and  Class  Members  conferred  non-gratuitous  benefits  upon \n7 CoreCivic  by  performing  โDollar-A-Day  Workโ  for  all  hours  worked  for  which \n8 CoreCivic would otherwise have had to pay at least the applicable minimum wage or \n9 more,  thereby  significantly  and  materially  increasing  CoreCivic's  profit  margins,  and \n10 unjustly enriching CoreCivic at the expense of and to the detriment of Plaintiffs and the \n11 Class Members. \n12 124.  CoreCivicโs retention of any benefit collected directly and indirectly from \n13 Plaintiffsโ and Class Members' labor and services violated principles of justice, equity, \n14 and good conscience. As a result, CoreCivic has been unjustly enriched.  Plaintiffs and \n15 Class Members are entitled to recover from CoreCivic all amounts that CoreCivic has \n16 wrongfully and improperly obtained, and CoreCivic should be required to disgorge to \n17 Plaintiffs and Class Members the benefits it has unjustly obtained.   \n18 125.  CoreCivic accepted or retained such benefits with knowledge that Plaintiffs' \n19 and Class Members' human rights and labor law right were being violated for financial \n20 gain.  CoreCivic has been unjustly enriched in retaining the revenues and profits from \n21 Plaintiffs  and  Class  Membersโ  Dollar-A-Day  Work,  which  retention  under  these \n22 circumstances is unjust and inequitable. \n23 126.  As a direct and proximate result of CoreCivicโs Forced Labor practices and \n24 the Dollar-A-Day Work program, Plaintiffs and Class Members have suffered concrete \n25 harm and injury, including, but not limited to, physical and emotional injury, monetary \n26 loss in connection with their labor and services provided CoreCivic purchases of services, \n27 and the unlawful violation of their human rights and labor law rights, as alleged herein. \n28 127.

Plaintiffs  and  Class \n2 Members are entitled to seek disgorgement and restitution of wrongful profits, revenue, \n3 and benefits conferred upon CoreCivic in a manner established by this Court. \n4 128.  Plaintiffs  and  Class  Members  are  further  entitled  to,  and  hereby  seek, \n5 reasonable attorneysโ fees and costs under Cal. Code of Civ.

Plaintiffs  and  the  Class  Members  incorporate  the  above  allegations  by \n11\nreference. \n12\n130.  Under PAGA, an aggrieved employee, on behalf of him or herself and other \n13\ncurrent or former employees as well as the general public, may bring a representative \n14\naction as a private attorney general to recover penalties for an employerโs violations of \n15\nthe Cal. Labor Code and IWC Wage Orders.  These civil penalties are in addition to any \n16\nother relief available under the California Labor Code.   \n17\n131.  Plaintiffs  are  aggrieved  employees  as  defined  in  Labor  Code  ยง  2699(a).  \n18\nPlaintiffs bring this cause of action on behalf of themselves and other current and former \n19\nemployees impacted by CoreCivicโs violations of the Cal. Labor Code and IWC Wage \n20\nOrder 5-2001 as described fully herein. \n21\n132.  As set forth above (and specifically in Plaintiffsโ Fourth through Twelfth \n22\nCauses of Action), CoreCivic committed violations of the California Labor Code against \n23\nPlaintiffs and, on information and belief, against other current or former employees while \n24\nthey were or are employed by CoreCivic as described in this FAC (and specifically when \n25\nthey were civil detainees in one of CoreCivicโs detention facilities). \n26\n133.  Plaintiffs thus seek to recover civil penalties and attorneysโ fees and costs as \n27\nauthorized under PAGA as a result of CoreCivicโs violations of the California Labor \n28\n  -32-\n  Case No. 17-CV-01112-JLS-NLS\n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 67   Filed 10/12/18   PageID.1041   Page 35 of 38\n \n \n1 Code and IWC Wage Order 5-2001. \n2 134.  Under PAGA, Plaintiffs are entitled to recover the maximum civil penalties \n3 permitted by law for the violations of the California Labor Code that are alleged in this \n4 FAC.   \n5 135.  Plaintiffs  are  entitled  to  civil  penalties,  to  be  paid  by  Defendant  and \n6 allocated as PAGA requires, pursuant to Cal. Labor Code ยง 2699(a), for Defendantโs \n7 violations  of  the  Cal.  Labor  Code  for  which  a  civil  penalty  is  already  specifically \n8 provided by law.   \n9 136.  Plaintiffs are also entitled to civil penalties, to be paid by Defendant and \n10 allocated as PAGA requires, pursuant to Cal. Labor Code ยง 2699(f), for Defendantโs \n11 violations of the Cal. Labor Code for which a civil penalty is not already specifically \n12 provided. \n13 137.  Additionally, Plaintiffs are entitled to recover their attorneyโs fees and costs \n14 pursuant to Cal. Labor Code ยง 2699(g)(1).   \n15 138.  On June 11, 2018, Plaintiffs provided written notice by certified mail to the \n16 LWDA of the legal claims and theories of this case (a true and correct cop of the June 11, \n17 2018 notice and receipt from the LWDA is attached hereto as Exhibit โAโ).  Plaintiffs \n18 simultaneously provided a copy of that notice by certified mail to CoreCivic and their \n19 counsel of record in this action.  The LWDA did not provide notice โwithin 65 calendar \n20 days of the postmark date ofโ Plaintiffsโ notice, so Plaintiffs are entitled to โ and hereby \n21 do โ assert a PAGA claim in this action arising from Defendantโs violations of the Cal. \n22 Labor Code IWC Wage Order 5-2001.

The Owino Plaintiffs are not parties to this case; they are plaintiffs \n22 \nin a related matter also before this Court, see Owino et al. v. CoreCivic, Inc., No. 17-CV-\n23 \n1112-JLS-NLS.    They  seek  to  intervene  in  the  above-captioned  case  (the  โGonzalez \n24 \nactionโ) for the limited purpose of opposing the Motion to Consolidate, currently pending \n25 \nbefore the Court, (see ECF No. 23).  The Owino Plaintiffsโ Motion for Limited Intervention \n26 \nis unopposed.  Having considered the proposed intervenorsโ arguments and the law, the \n27 \nCourt GRANTS the Motion for Limited Intervention, (ECF No. 32), to the extent detailed \n28 \n1 \n17-CV-2573 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-JLS-NLS   Document 36   Filed 03/06/18   PageID.199   Page 2 of 5\n \n1  herein.  The Court DENIES AS MOOT the ex parte Motion to Shorten Time, (ECF No. \n2  33).  On its own motion, the Court VACATES the hearing on the Motion for Limited \n3  Intervention, (ECF No. 32), presently set for March 22, 2018. \n4  BACKGROUND \n5  On May 31, 2017, Sylvester Owino and Jonathon Gomez (the โOwino Plaintiffsโ) \n6  filed suit against Defendant CoreCivic, Inc. in  Owino et al. v. CoreCivic, Inc., No. 17-CV-\n7  1112-JLS-NLS.  On August 11, 2017, Defendant CoreCivic filed a motion to dismiss for \n8  failure to state a claim.  Then, on December 27, 2017, Plaintiffs Carlos Gonzalez et al. (the \n9  โGonzalez Plaintiffsโ) filed a complaint against CoreCivic, Inc. in the Gonzalez action, No. \n10  17-CV-2573-JLS-NLS.  On January 22, 2018, the Gonzalez Plaintiffs filed a Motion to \n11  Consolidate Cases and Appoint Interim Lead Class Counsel, (ECF No. 23).  In light of the \n12  Motion to Consolidate and the potential common issues between these two actions, the \n13  Court stayed the Owino et al. v. CoreCivic case and deferred ruling on Defendantโs motion \n14  to dismiss.  The Owino Plaintiffs now seek to intervene in the Gonzalez action for the sole \n15  purpose of opposing the pending Motion to Consolidate. \n16  LEGAL STANDARD \n17  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2) permits a party to intervene as a matter of \n18  right.    The  Ninth  Circuit  has  adopted  โ[a]  four-part  test  .  .  .  to  determine  whether \n19  applications for intervention as a matter of right pursuant to Rule 24(a)(2) should be \n20  granted.โ  Cnty. of Orange v. Air Cal., 799 F.2d 535, 537 (9th Cir. 1986).  \n21  An order granting intervention as of right is appropriate if: (1) \nthe applicantโs motion is timely; (2) the applicant has asserted an \n22 \ninterest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject \n23  of  the  action;  (3)  the  applicant  is  so  situated  that  without \nintervention the disposition may, as a practical matter, impair or \n24 \nimpede its ability to protect that interest; and (4) the applicantโs \n25  interest is not adequately represented by the existing parties. \n26  Id. (quoting United States v. Stringfellow, 783 F.2d 821, 826 (9th Cir. 1986)).  โGenerally, \n27  Rule 24(a)(2) is construed broadly in favor of proposed intervenors and โ[courts] are guided \n28  primarily by practical considerations.โโ  United States ex rel. McGough v. Covington \n2 \n17-CV-2573 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-JLS-NLS   Document 36   Filed 03/06/18   PageID.200   Page 3 of 5\n \n1  Techs. Co., 967 F.2d 1391, 1394 (9th Cir. 1992) (quoting Stringfellow, 783 F.2d at 826).  \n2  โThe โliberal policy in favor of intervention serves both efficient resolution of issues and \n3  broadened access to the courts.โโ  Peruta v. Cnty. of San Diego, 711 F.3d 570, 577 (9th \n4  Cir. 2014) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (quoting United States v. City of Los Angeles, 288 F.3d \n5  391, 397โ98 (9th Cir. 2002)).  \n6    Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b) provides that an application for permissive \n7  intervention may be granted if the party seeking to intervene โhas a claim or defense that \n8  shares with the main action a common question of law or fact.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(1)(B).  \n9  โGenerally, permissive intervention under Rule 24(b) requires โ(1) an independent ground \n10  for jurisdiction; (2) a timely motion; and (3) a common question of law and fact between \n11  the movantโs claim or defense and the main action.โโ  Blum v. Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner \n12  & Smith Inc., 712 F.3d 1349, 1353 (9th Cir. 2013) (quoting Beckman Indus., Inc. v. Intโl \n13  Ins. Co., 966 F.2d 470, 476 (9th Cir. 1992)).  โPermissive intervention is committed to the \n14  broad discretion of the district court.โ  Air Cal., 799 F.2d at 539 (citing United States v. \n15  $129,374  in  U.S.  Currency,  769  F.2d  583,  586  (9th  Cir.  1985)).    โIn  exercising  its \n16  discretion, the court must consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice \n17  the adjudication or the original partiesโ rights.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(3).  \n18    Additionally, โ[t]he district courtโs discretion . . . under Rule 24(b), to grant or deny \n19  an  application  for permissive  intervention  includes  discretion  to  limit  intervention  to \n20  particular issues.โ  Depโt of Fair Empโt & Housing v. Lucent Techs., Inc., 642 F.3d 728, \n21  741 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Van Hoomissen v. Xerox Corp., 497 F.2d 180, 181 (9th Cir. \n22  1974)). \n23  ANALYSIS \n24    The Owino Plaintiffs argue that the Court should grant their motion as either an \n25  intervention as a matter of right, under Rule 24(a)(2), or permissive intervention, under \n26  Rule 24(b).  (See ECF No. 32-1, at 3โ11.)  The Court finds that a permissive intervention \n27  under Rule 24(b) is appropriate because the Owino Plaintiffs seek to intervene for the \n28  limited purpose of opposing the Gonzalez Plaintiffsโ Motion to Consolidate.  (See id. at 2.)  \n3 \n17-CV-2573 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-JLS-NLS   Document 36   Filed 03/06/18   PageID.201   Page 4 of 5\n \n1  In so doing, the Court does not decide the merits of the Owino Plaintiffsโ intervention as a \n2  matter of right.  The Court interprets the Owino Plaintiffsโ motion as limited to opposing \n3  the motion to consolidate, rather than intervening in the case as a party.  This finding, of \n4  course, does not bar the Owino Plaintiffs from moving for such relief in the future.   \n5  The Court finds that the Owino Plaintiffsโ Motion for Limited Intervention meets \n6  Rule 24(b)โs requirements.  See Blum, 712 F.3d at 1353.  The Owino Plaintiffs have an \n7  independent ground for jurisdiction as they are properly before the Court in case number \n8  17-CV-1112; their filing is timely because the Motion to Consolidate remains pending; and \n9  the Motion to Consolidate implicates common questions of law and fact because all \n10  Plaintiffs allege violations of law arising out of Defendantโs operation of its Otay Mesa \n11  Detention Facility.  Most importantly, the Owino Plaintiffs represent in their Motion for \n12  Limited Intervention that no party opposes their Motion.  (ECF No. 32, at 2.)  Accordingly, \n13  the Court GRANTS the Owino Plaintiffsโ Motion to Intervene.  However, the Court limits \n14  the  intervention  as  follows:  the  Owino  Plaintiffs  may  oppose,  and  file  briefings  as \n15  necessary to oppose, the Gonzalez Plaintiffsโ Motion to Consolidate, (ECF No. 23). See \n16  Depโt of Fair Empโt & Housing, 642 F.3d at 741.  The Owino Plaintiffs are not, at this \n17  time, parties to the Gonzalez action, No. 17-CV-2573. \n18  CONCLUSION \n19  Good cause appearing, the Court GRANTS the Motion for Limited Intervention, \n20  (ECF No. 32), to the extent detailed above.  The Court DENIES AS MOOT the ex parte \n21  Motion to Shorten Time, (ECF No. 33).  On its own motion, the Court VACATES the \n22  hearing on the Motion for Limited Intervention, presently set for March 22, 2018.  The \n23  Owino Plaintiffs represent that they are prepared to file an Opposition brief to the Motion \n24  to Consolidate on or before March 8, 2018.

The Owino Plaintiffs are former civil immigration detainees \n7  and allege they were paid $1 a day for labor while they were interred at Defendantโs Otay \n8  Mesa Detention Facility.  (Id. ยถ 10.)  They also allege that other detainees were forced to \n9  work for no pay.  (Id. ยถ 13.)  Owino Plaintiffs seek to certify a class of โall civil immigration \n10  detainees  who  performed  Forced  Labor  uncompensated  work  for  CoreCivic  at  any \n11  Detention Facility owned or operated by it between November 2, 2004 to the applicable \n12  opt-out date, inclusive.โ  (Id. ยถ 30.) \n13  On December 27, 2017, Gonzalez Plaintiffs filed a second putative class action \n14  lawsuit against Defendant in the Southern District.  (โGonzalez Compl.,โ ECF No. 1.)  The \n15  case was transferred from Judge Anthony J. Battagliaโs calendar to this Court pursuant to \n16  Civil Local Rule 40.1.  The Gonzalez Plaintiffs, like Owino Plaintiffs, are former civil \n17  immigration detainees housed at Defendantโs Otay Mesa facility.  They allege that they \n18  received $1 or $1.50 a day for their labor at the detention facility.  The Gonzales Plaintiffs \n19  seek to certify classes, including โ[a]ll civil immigration detainees who performed work \n20  for CoreCivic at the Otay Mesa Detention Center in the Work Program within the past ten \n21  years.โ  (Id. ยถ 111.)  Gonzalez Plaintiffs now seek to consolidate the two class actions. \n22  LEGAL STANDARD \n23  Consolidation of actions is appropriate โ[i]f actions before the court involve a \n24  common question of law or fact.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(a)(2).  A district court has broad \n25  discretion in determining whether to consolidate actions pending in the same district.  See \n26  Investors Research Co. v. U.S. Dist. Court for Cent. Dist. Of Cal., 877 F.2d 777, 777 (9th \n27  Cir. 1989) (citing 9 Charles A. Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure ยง 2383 \n28  (1971); and A/S J. Ludwig Mowinckles Rederi v. Tidewater Const. Co., 559 F.2d 928 (4th \n2 \n17-CV-2573 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-JLS-NLS   Document 44   Filed 04/04/18   PageID.368   Page 3 of 10\n \n1  Cir. 1977)).  โIn determining whether to consolidate cases, a court should also weigh any \n2  time and effort saved by consolidation against any โinconvenience, delay, or expense that \n3  [consolidation] would cause.โโ Fialkov v. Celladon Corp., No. 15CV1458 AJB (DHB), \n4  2015 WL 11658717, at *2 (S.D. Cal. Dec. 9, 2015) (alteration in original) (citing Huene v. \n5  United States, 743 F.2d 703, 704 (9th Cir. 1984)). \n6  ANALYSIS \n7  All parties across both actions agree that the Owino and Gonzalez actions involve \n8  related facts and claims.  The parties diverge, however, on what steps the Court should take \n9  to manage its docket and proceed forward with this case and the Owino case.  Gonzalez \n10  Plaintiffs argue that their action involves common questions of law and fact such that \n11  consolidation of their action with the Owino action would be appropriate.  (See MTN 4.)1  \n12  Both Owino Plaintiffs and Defendant argue that the Court should exercise its discretion to \n13  dismiss,  rather  than  consolidate,  the  Gonzalez  action  because  the  Gonzalez  action  is \n14  duplicative of the Owino action.  (Def Oppโn 11; Owino Oppโn 7.)  In response, Gonzalez \n15  Plaintiffs argue that dismissal of their action would be inappropriate because the two \n16  actions are not duplicative.  (Reply 6.)  The Court proceeds as follows.  First, the Court \n17  determines whether the Gonzalez action is duplicative of the Owino action.  Second, the \n18  Court determines which procedural action best serves the interests of judicial economy and \n19  preserves the rights of all parties going forward. \n20  I.  Whether the Gonzalez Action is Duplicative  \n21  As a threshold matter, the Court clarifies which rules or standards it applies in the \n22  analysis here.  There are three similar rules the Court could apply to the issue before the \n23  Court.  The Gonzalez Plaintiffs urge the Court apply Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 42, \n24  which permits the Court to consolidate actions involving โcommon question of law or \n25  fact.โ  The Owino Plaintiffs would have the Court adopt a โfirst-to-fileโ rule, which applies \n26  when two similar actions are filed in different federal courts.  Defendant submits the rule \n27 \n                                                                 \n28 \n1 Pin citations refer to the page numbers electronically stamped on the EM/CMF filings. \n3 \n17-CV-2573 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-JLS-NLS   Document 44   Filed 04/04/18   PageID.369   Page 4 of 10\n \n1  against claim splitting applies, which courts invoke when a plaintiff files two actions \n2  against the same defendant based on the same facts.  District courts in this circuit have \n3  analyzed duplicative class actions under both the first-to-file rule, see Weinstein v. Metlife, \n4  Inc., No. C 06-4444 SI, 2006 WL 3201045, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 6, 2006), and the claim-\n5  splitting rule, see Chowning v. Kohlโs Depโt Stores, Inc., No. CV 15-8673 RGK (SPx), \n6  2016 WL 7655752, at *2 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 2, 2016).  The Court applies the claim-splitting \n7  rule because the first-to-file rule applies to cases between different districts.  See Moore v. \n8  Roadway Express, Inc., No. CV 09-1588, 2009 WL 10670954, at *4 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 7, \n9  2009). \n10  โDistrict courts retain broad discretion to control their dockets and โ[i]n the exercise \n11  of  that  power  they  may  impose  sanctions  including,  where  appropriate,  default  or \n12  dismissal.โโ  Adams v. Cal. Depโt of Health Servs., 487 F.3d 684, 688 (9th Cir. 2007) \n13  (alteration in original) (quoting Thompson v. Hous. Auth. of City of L.A., 782 F.2d 829, 831 \n14  (9th Cir. 1986) (per curiam); and citing Link v. Wabash R.R., 370 U.S. 626, 629โ30 (1962)), \n15  abrogated in part by Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U.S. 880, 904 (2008).  โPlaintiffs generally \n16  have โno right to maintain two separate actions involving the same subject matter at the \n17  same time in the same court and against the same defendant.โโ  Id. (quoting Walton v. Eaton \n18  Corp., 563 F.2d 66, 70 (3d Cir. 1977) (en banc)). \n19  To determine whether a suit is duplicative, courts apply the test for claim preclusion.  \n20  See The Haytian Republic, 154 U.S. 118, 124 (1894).  This is a two-part standard.  Thus, a \n21  court must first determine whether the causes of action and relief sought in the two suits \n22  are identical.  Adams, 487 F.3d at 689.  Then a court determines whether the parties, or \n23  their privies, are the same.  Id. \n24  A. Same Causes of Action \n25  To determine whether two causes of action are similar, courts apply a transactional \n26  test.  Id.  โWhether two events are part of the same transaction or series depends on whether \n27  they are related to the same set of facts and whether they could conveniently be tried \n28  together.โ  Id. (quoting W. Sys., Inc. v. Ulloa, 958 F.2d 864, 871 (9th Cir. 1992); and citing \n4 \n17-CV-2573 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-JLS-NLS   Document 44   Filed 04/04/18   PageID.370   Page 5 of 10\n \n1  Restatement (Second) of Judgments ยง 24(1) (1982)).  Courts examine four criteria: \n2  (1) whether rights or interests established in the prior judgment \nwould be destroyed or impaired by prosecution of the second \n3 \naction; (2) whether substantially the same evidence is presented \n4  in the two actions; (3) whether the two suits involve infringement \nof the same right; and (4) whether the two suits arise out of the \n5 \nsame transactional nucleus of facts. \n6   \n7  Id. (quoting Costantini v. Trans World Airlines, 681 F.2d 1199, 1201โ02 (9th Cir. 1982)).  \n8  โThe last of these criteria is the most important.โ  Constantini, 681 F.2d at 1202. \n9  Gonzalez Plaintiffs argue that while the two actions involve substantially similar \n10  questions of fact and law such that consolidation is appropriate the claims are not identical.  \n11  (Reply 7.)  According to Gonzalez Plaintiffs, their Complaint brings five causes of action \n12  compared to the twelve โscattershotโ causes of action brought by Owino Plaintiffs.  (Id.)  \n13  Gonzalez Plaintiffs also point to at least two factual differences: they allege that some \n14  members of the putative class were paid more than $1 a day and they allege that Defendant \n15  obtains labor through unlawful means.  (Id.) \n16  Both Owino Plaintiffs and Defendant explain, in detail, the commonality between \n17  the two suits.  For example, both the Gonzalez and Owino Plaintiffs allege that Defendant \n18  pays civil detainees who voluntarily participate in work programs less than the minimum \n19  wage, (Def. Oppโn 7 (comparing Gonzalez Compl. ยถยถ 40โ47, 127, 132 with Owino Compl. \n20  ยถยถ 11, 13โ15, 73, 123)), and that Defendant coerces or forces detainees to work under threat \n21  of solitary confinement or loss of privileges, (id. (comparing Gonzalez Compl. ยถยถ 8, 32, \n22  38โ39, 147โ48, 153โ54 with Owino Compl. ยถยถ 13, 16, 42, 47, 57โ59)).  Both Owino \n23  Plaintiffs and Defendant point to Gonzalez Plaintiffsโ own Motion to Consolidate where \n24  Gonzalez Plaintiffs argue โboth Actions seek to stop the economic exploitation and abuse \n25  of detainees at the Otay Mesa Facility, to recover unpaid wages, and to remedy unjust \n26  enrichment resulting from CoreCivicโs unlawful failure to pay its detainee workforce legal \n27  wages.โ  (Id. (quoting MTN 5); see Owino Oppโn 10โ11.)  Finally, both cases bring causes \n28  of action sounding in violation of the same laws and both cases ask for similar relief.  (Def. \n5 \n17-CV-2573 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-JLS-NLS   Document 44   Filed 04/04/18   PageID.371   Page 6 of 10\n \n1  Oppโn 9โ10.) \n2  The Court agrees with Owino Plaintiffs and Defendant.  Both cases arise from the \n3  same transactional nucleus of fact.  Both cases argue that Defendant is not following \n4  California minimum wage laws and both cases argue that Defendant coerces its detainees \n5  to participate in a work program at its Otay Mesa detention facility.  Both cases bring \n6  similar causes of action and request similar relief.  Indeed, the entire bases for Gonzalez \n7  Plaintiffsโ Motion of Consolidation are the common questions of law and fact.  The test is \n8  not, as Gonzalez Plaintiffs suggest, whether the two cases are exactly identical.  The test is \n9  transactional.  Here, it is clearly metโthe facts are duplicative. \n10  B. Same Parties \n11  At this point, the Courtโs analysis must diverge from Adams.  The Adams court asked \n12  whether a party in an earlier-filed action could be said to have โvirtually representedโ a \n13  party in a later-filed action.  487 F.3d at 691.  The Supreme Court has since made clear that \n14  โvirtual representationโ is not consonant with the claim preclusion test.  See Taylor, 553 \n15  U.S. at 901.  Gonzalez Plaintiffs direct the Court to the Supreme Courtโs decision in Smith \n16  v. Bayer Corp., 564 U.S. 299 (2011), which concerned the preclusive effect of an earlier-\n17  filed class action on a later filed class action.  The Supreme Court explained that for claim \n18  preclusion to apply the later filed suit must have presented the same issues as the prior case \n19  and the later filed plaintiff must have been a party to the earlier-filed suit or else fall within \n20  one of a few discrete exceptions to the general rule against binding nonparties.  See id. at \n21  307โ08.  The Supreme Court held that โ[n]either a proposed class action nor a rejected \n22  class action may bind nonparties.โ  Id. at 315. \n23  Here, the Owino Plaintiffs have not been certified as a class under Federal Rule of \n24  Civil Procedure 23.  Instead, Owino is a proposed class action.  The Court agrees with \n25  Gonzalez Plaintiffs that the Owino action cannot bind nonparties, like Gonzalez Plaintiffs.  \n26  See Bayer, 553 U.S. at 315.  Because the Owino action does not have preclusive effect \n27  against the Gonzalez Plaintiffs, the claim-splitting rule must also fail.  See Chowning, 2016 \n28  WL 7655752, at *3 (applying Bayer to find earlier-filed class action that was rejected in \n6 \n17-CV-2573 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-JLS-NLS   Document 44   Filed 04/04/18   PageID.372   Page 7 of 10\n \n1  part was not binding on later-filed class action and declining to dismiss later-filed action).  \n2  The Court finds that dismissing the Gonzalez action is not appropriate at this time, given \n3  the early stage of the Owino action and that its class has not been certified. \n4  II.  Consolidation vs. Stay \n5    While the claim-splitting rule is not appropriate at this time, such a finding does not \n6  resolve the issue before the Court: how to proceed with two nearly identical putative class \n7  actions.  The district court in Moreno v. Castlerock Farming & Transport, No. CIV-F-12-\n8  0556 AWI JLT, 2013 WL 1326496 (E.D. Cal. Mar. 29, 2013), encountered a similar issue.  \n9  There, two putative class actions were pending before the same court; neither class action \n10  had been certified.  Id. at *1.  The district court reasoned that the scope of the putative class \n11  in the earlier-filed action would depend greatly on an order granting or denying class \n12  certification.  Id. at *2.  Further, the later-filed class would depend on the scope of the \n13  earlier-filed class.  The court stated:  \n14  If the class in [the earlier-filed action] is certified as narrow, then \nthe [later-filed] Plaintiffs can move forward to represent all other \n15 \nworkers  at  [the  defendantโs]  facilities.    Indeed,  all  pre-class \n16  certification discovery received by [earlier-filed plaintiff] could \nbe directly given to the [later-filed] Plaintiffs to save time and \n17 \neffort in that circumstance.  If the class certified in [the earlier-\n18  filed action] is wide, then [the later-filed action] would probably \nbe  considered  duplicative  and  subject  to  dismissal.    If  class \n19 \ncertification is denied for some other reason not having to do \n20  with  [the  earlier-filed  plaintiffโs]  status,  then  [the  later-filed \naction] may or may not be able to proceed depending upon the \n21 \nspecific circumstance. \n22   \n23  Id. (citing Bayer, 564 U.S. at 314). \n24  The Moreno courtโs reasoning and conclusion are persuasive.  Here, the Owino \n25  Plaintiffs  seek  to  certify  sub-classes  potentially  broader  in  scope  than  the  Gonzalez \n26  Plaintiffs.  For example, both lawsuits endeavor to certify a civil detainee sub-class who \n27  performed work for less than Californiaโs minimum wage.   The Gonzalez Plaintiffsโ \n28  putative minimum wage sub-class is limited to all detainees who performed work for \n7 \n17-CV-2573 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-JLS-NLS   Document 44   Filed 04/04/18   PageID.373   Page 8 of 10\n \n1  Defendant at the Otay Mesa Detention Center within the past ten years.  (Gonzalez Compl. \n2  ยถ 111a.)  The Owino Plaintiffsโ putative minimum wage sub-class covers all detainees at \n3  any facility located in California owned or operated by Defendant between November 2, \n4  2004 and the applicable opt-out date.  (Owino Compl. ยถ 30.)  The remaining sub-classes \n5  follow similar limitations: the Gonzalez Plaintiffs limit the classes to only the Otay Mesa \n6  facility for the past ten years; the Owino Plaintiffs limit the classes to any Defendant-owned \n7  facility in California since 2004.  (Compare Gonzalez Compl. ยถ 111 with Owino Compl. \n8  ยถ 30.) \n9  Thus, the Owino Plaintiffs could potentially certify a broad class that subsumes the \n10  Gonzalez Plaintiffsโ class.  Or, the Owino Plaintiffs could certify a narrower class that does \n11  not include the putative Gonzalez class.  At the pre-certification stage, the Court cannot \n12  determine the size or composition of a class in either case.  Like Moreno, a stay appears to \n13  be the equitable solution.  See also Clardy v. Pinnacle Foods Grp., LLC, No. 16-cv-4385-\n14  JST, 2017 WL 57310 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 5, 2017) (staying later-filed class action). \n15  The other course of action is to consolidate the cases.  Certainly, the Gonzalez \n16  Plaintiffs strongly advocate for this outcome.  Yet, both Owino Plaintiffs and Defendant \n17  object to consolidation.  Gonzalez Plaintiffs warns that โit would be an abuse of discretion \n18  to appoint an attorney as class counsel solely because he may have won the race to the \n19  courthouse.โ  (Reply 6 (quoting Northstar Fin. Advisors Inc. v. Schwab Invs., 779 F.3d \n20  1036, 1048 (9th Cir. 2015)).)  Indeed, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(g) lays out \n21  objective standards to determine appointment of lead class counsel.  Appointment of \n22  interim class counsel, however, is not the issue presently before the Court.  The issue here \n23  is whether to consolidate or whether to stayโnot appointment of interim class counsel.  \n24  Courts have the power to stay proceedings sua sponte.  Ali v Trump, 241 F. Supp. \n25  3d 1147, 1152 (W.D. Wash. 2017); Fed. Home Loan Mortg. Corp. v. Karma, No. 14-00137 \n26  ACK-KSC, 2016 WL 922780, at *8โ9 (D. Haw. Mar. 9, 2016).  The issues involved in the \n27  pending proceedings need not be โcontrolling of the action before the courtโ for the court \n28  to issue a stay.  Leyva v. Certified Grocers of Cal., Ltd., 593 F.2d 857, 864 (9th Cir. 1979).  \n8 \n17-CV-2573 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-JLS-NLS   Document 44   Filed 04/04/18   PageID.374   Page 9 of 10\n \n1  Indeed, for a court to issue a stay, the parties in the two cases need not be the same and the \n2  issues need not be identical.  See Landis v. N. Am. Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254 (1936). \n3  In determining whether to grant a motion to stay, โthe competing interests [that] will \n4  be affected by the granting or refusal to grant a stay must be weighed.โ  Lockyer v. Mirant \n5  Corp., 398 F.3d 1098, 1110 (9th Cir. 2005) (citing CMAX, Inc. v. Hall, 300 F.2d 265, 268 \n6  (9th Cir. 1962)).  Those interests include: (1) โthe possible damage which may result from \n7  the granting of a stay,โ (2) โthe hardship or inequity which a party may suffer in being \n8  required to go forward,โ and (3) โthe orderly course of justice measured in terms of the \n9  simplifying or complicating of issues, proof, and questions of law which could be expected \n10  to result from a stay.โ  Id.  \n11  Here, the Court again finds the Moreno courtโs reasoning persuasive as to the first \n12  and second factors.  If the class in Owino is certified as narrow then the Gonzalez Plaintiffs \n13  can move forward to represent all other detainees at Defendantโs facilities.  All pre-class \n14  certification discovery received by Owino Plaintiffs could, in theory, be given to Gonzalez \n15  Plaintiffs to save time and effort.  If the class certified in Owino is wide, then Gonzalez \n16  would probably be considered duplicative and subject to dismissal.  If class certification is \n17  denied for a reason beyond Owino Plaintiffsโ status then Gonzalez Plaintiffs may or may \n18  not be able to proceed.  See Moreno, 2013 WL 1326496, at *2.  The Court recognizes there \n19  is some possibility of damage to the Gonzalez Plaintiffsโif the Owino Plaintiffs certify a \n20  narrow class or their claim is dismissed then the Gonzalez Plaintiffs suffer from the delay \n21  in litigating.  However, the potential damage to the Gonzalez Plaintiffs is mitigated, in part, \n22  because the Court will only stay their proceedings until resolution of the Owino Plaintiffsโ \n23  class certification.2  As to the second factor, the Court finds the hardship on all parties to \n24  be significant if parallel litigation is allowed to proceed on the same issues and the same \n25  Defendant.  On the other hand, the hardship on the Gonzalez Plaintiffsโ is measured in the \n26 \n                                                                 \n27 \n2 This assumes that the Owino Plaintiffs reach the class certification stage. If Defendant prevails on its \nmotion to dismiss or some other unforeseen event occurs then the Gonzalez Plaintiffs may request \n28 \nappropriate relief from the stay. \n9 \n17-CV-2573 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-JLS-NLS   Document 44   Filed 04/04/18   PageID.375   Page 10 of 10\n \n1  potential delay in resolving their rights.  As to the third factor, all parties agree that the \n2  Court  should  simplify  the  issues  by  eliminating  the  parallel  proceedings,  either  by \n3  consolidation or by stay or dismissal.  In sum, the Court finds that the Gonzalez Plaintiffsโ \n4  interest is outweighed by the potential claim-splitting concerns as well as judicial economy. \n5  The Court is under no illusion as to the stakes of this Motion.  Gonzalez Plaintiffs \n6  filed a nearly identical cause of action as the Owino Plaintiffs, seek to consolidate the cases, \n7  and wrest control of interim class counsel from the Owino Plaintiffs.  Owino Plaintiffs and \n8  Defendant seek to dismiss the later-filed action as duplicative to send a strong message \n9  against copy-cat filings.  The truth lies somewhere in between.  Thus, the Court exercises \n10  its discretion to chart a course between the two positions.  The Court will stay this case \n11  pending the outcome of Owino Plaintiffsโ future class certification.  At such a time, the \n12  Gonzalez Plaintiffs may request appropriate relief from the stay. \n13  CONCLUSION \n14  For the reasons stated above, the Court DENIES Gonzalez Plaintiffsโ Motion to \n15  Consolidate, (ECF No. 23).  On its own motion, the Court STAYS the present case until it \n16  rules on class certification (or other dispositive motions, such as a motion to dismiss with \n17  prejudice) in Owino. \n18    IT IS SO ORDERED.  \n19 \nDated:  April 4, 2018   \n20 \n   \n21   \n \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n10 \n17-CV-2573 JLS (NLS) ",

The Court held a hearing on December 19, 2019.  See ECF Nos. 154, 159 (โTr.โ).  \n4  Having carefully considered the Partiesโ arguments, the evidence, and the law, the Court \n5  DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE Plaintiffsโ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment \n6  (ECF No. 97), DENIES Defendantโs Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings (ECF No. \n7  117), DENIES AS MOOT Plaintiffsโ Motion to Exclude (ECF No. 128), and GRANTS \n8  IN PART AND DENIES IN PART Plaintiffsโ Motion for Class Certification (ECF No. \n9  84), as follows. \n10  BACKGROUND \n11  I.  Factual Background1 \n12  Plaintiffs  are  civil  immigration  detainees  who  are  involuntary  confined  at \n13  Defendantโs  detention  facilities  under  the  custody  of  Immigration  and  Customs \n14  Enforcement (โICEโ).  See Pls.โ Stmt. of Facts, ECF Nos. 97-2, 99-1 (sealed), ยถยถ 1, 37, 41.  \n15  During their period of detention, Plaintiffs and other ICE detainees performed work for \n16  Defendant through a Voluntary Work Program (โVWPโ).  Id.  Defendant paid those \n17  participating in the VWP between $0.75 and $1.50 per day, id. ยถ 18, which is less than \n18  Californiaโs minimum wage.  See id. ยถ 35.  Defendant also coerced detainees to perform \n19  additional, uncompensated work under threat of punishment.  See id. ยถยถ 11, 13, 16. \n20  II.  Procedural Background \n21  Plaintiffs filed this putative class action on May 1, 2017, alleging seven causes of \n22  action  for  (1)  forced  labor  and  violation  of  the  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Act \n23  (โTVPAโ), 18 U.S.C. ยงยง 1589 et seq.; (2) forced labor and violation of the California \n24 \n                                                                 \n25 \n1 Plaintiffs request the Court to exclude โattachment B to Exhibit 1, and all attachments to Exhibits 4, 6, \n26  7, 8, 11, and 13โ filed in support of Defendantโs opposition to their Motion for Class Certification โon the \ngrounds that they were not timely producedโ by the March 15, 2019 deadline to complete class discovery \n27 \nimposed by Magistrate Judge Nita L. Stormes.  See ECF No. 128-1 at 1.  Because the Court does not rely \non any of the attachments Plaintiffs have challenged in ruling on Plaintiffsโ Certification Motion, the Court \n28 \nDENIES AS MOOT Plaintiffsโ Motion to Exclude (ECF No. 128). \n2 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8265   Page 3 of 59\n \n1  TVPA, Cal. Civ. Code ยง 52.5; (3) unfair competition, Cal. Bus & Prof. Code ยงยง 17200 et \n2  seq.; (4) violations of the California Labor Code; (5) violation of California Industrial \n3  Welfare Commission (โIWCโ) Orders; (6) negligence; and (7) unjust enrichment.  See \n4  generally ECF No. 1.  Plaintiffs alleged that the action was being brought on behalf of three \n5  classes:  (1) a โNationwide Forced Labor Classโ comprised of โ[a]ll civil immigration \n6  detainees  who  performed  Forced  Labor  uncompensated  work  for  CoreCivic  at  any \n7  Detention Facility owned or operated by it between November 2, 2004[,] to the applicable \n8  opt-out date, inclusiveโ; (2) a โCalifornia Forced Labor Classโ comprised of โ[a]ll civil \n9  immigration detainees who performed Forced Labor uncompensated work for CoreCivic \n10  at any Detention Facility located in California owned or operated by it at [any] time during \n11  the period from November 2, 2004[,] to the applicable op-out date, inclusiveโ; and (3) a \n12  โCalifornia  Labor  Law  Classโ  comprised  of  โ[a]ll  civil  immigration  detainees  who \n13  performed Dollar-A-Day Work for CoreCivic and were paid one dollar ($1) per day at any \n14  Detention Facility located in California owned or operated by it at any time between \n15  November 2, 2004[,] to the applicable op-out date, inclusive.โ  Id. ยถ 30. \n16  On August 11, 2017, Defendant moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim under \n17  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), see generally ECF No. 18, a motion that the \n18  Court later granted in part and denied in part.  See generally ECF No. 38.  Defendant then \n19  answered Plaintiffsโ complaint, โadmit[ting] that jurisdiction is proper in this Court.โ  See \n20  ECF No. 44 ยถยถ 2โ3, 5.  Although Defendant raised several affirmative defenses, it did not \n21  raise any jurisdictional defenses.  See id. at 21โ27. \n22  On September 11, 2018, Plaintiffs moved to file an amended complaint โfor the \n23  purpose of adding a claim for violations of the Private Attorney General Act (โPAGAโ), \n24  Cal. Labor Code ยงยง 2698, et seq.,โ ECF No. 64, a request Defendant did not oppose.  See \n25  ECF No. 65.  The Court therefore granted Plaintiffsโ motion, see ECF No. 66, and Plaintiffs \n26  filed their First Amended Complaint on October 12, 2018, see generally ECF No. 67 \n27  (โFACโ), adding a new cause of action for violation of PAGA โ[o]n [b]ehalf of Plaintiffs \n28  [i]ndividually and the Class.โ  See id. ยถยถ 129โ38.  Again, Plaintiffs alleged three classes: a \n3 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8266   Page 4 of 59\n \n1  Nationwide Forced Labor Class, a California Forced Labor Class, and a California Labor \n2  Law Class.  See id. ยถ 30. \n3  Defendant answered Plaintiffsโ First Amended Complaint on October 26, 2018.  See \n4  generally ECF No. 70.  For the first time, Defendant โadmit[ted] only that this Court has \n5  specific personal jurisdiction over CoreCivic as to the claims arising out of CoreCivicโs \n6  California facilitiesโ and โdenie[d] that this Court has general personal jurisdiction over \n7  CoreCivic as to claims arising out of CoreCivicโs non-California facilities.โ  Id. ยถ 5; see \n8  also id. ยถ 31 (โCoreCivic further affirmatively  alleges that this Court lacks  personal \n9  jurisdiction  over  CoreCivic  as  to  Plaintiffsโ  claims  arising  out  of  CoreCivicโs  non-\n10  California facilities.โ).  CoreCivic also raised a new affirmative defense in its answer to \n11  Plaintiffsโ First Amended Complaint:  โAs a separate defense, and in the alternative, \n12  CoreCivic alleges that this Court lacks personal jurisdiction over CoreCivic as to Plaintiffsโ \n13  claims arising out of Plaintiffsโ non-California facilities.โ  Id. at 22 ยถ 8.  \n14  On April 15, 2019, Plaintiffs filed their Certification Motion, seeking to certify five \n15  classes, see generally ECF No. 84, and Plaintiffs filed their Motion for Partial Summary \n16  Judgment, seeking summary adjudication as to whether Plaintiffs are employees under \n17  California law and on Plaintiffsโ claims for violation of California Labor Code sections \n18  226 and 1194, on June 5, 2019.  See generally ECF No. 97.  On July 11, 2019, Defendant \n19  filed its Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, โmov[ing] this Court, pursuant to Fed. R. \n20  Civ. P. 12(c) to grant judgment on the pleadings and dismiss all putative class claims that \n21  arose outside of California for lack of personal jurisdiction.โ  See ECF No. 117 at 2.  \n22  Plaintiffs moved to exclude certain evidence Defendant introduced in its opposition to their \n23  Certification Motion on August 1, 2019, โon the grounds that Defendant violated this \n24  Courtโs scheduling order regarding class discovery, as well as two of the Courtโs discovery \n25  orders,โ by producing documents โto Plaintiffs for the first time months after the close of \n26  class discovery.โ  See ECF No. 128 at 2. \n27  / / / \n28  / / / \n4 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8267   Page 5 of 59\n \n1  PLAINTIFFSโ MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n2  I.  Legal Standard \n3  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a), a party may move for summary \n4  judgment as to a claim or defense or part of a claim or defense.  Summary judgment, or \n5  partial summary judgment, is appropriate where the Court is satisfied that there is โno \n6  genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter \n7  of law.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986).  Material \n8  facts are those that may affect the outcome of the case.  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., \n9  477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).  A genuine dispute of material fact exists only if โthe evidence \n10  is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.โ  Id.  When \n11  the Court considers the evidence presented by the parties, โ[t]he evidence of the non-\n12  movant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.โ  Id. at \n13  255. \n14  The initial burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact falls \n15  on the moving party.  Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323.  The moving party may meet this burden \n16  by identifying the โportions of โthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and \n17  admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,โโ that show an absence of dispute \n18  regarding a material fact.  Id.  When a plaintiff seeks summary judgment as to an element \n19  for which it bears the burden of proof, โit must come forward with evidence which would \n20  entitle it to a directed verdict if the evidence went uncontroverted at trial.โ  C.A.R. Transp. \n21  Brokerage Co. v. Darden Rests., Inc., 213 F.3d 474, 480 (9th Cir. 2000) (quoting Houghton \n22  v. South, 965 F.2d 1532, 1536 (9th Cir. 1992)). \n23  Once  the  moving  party  satisfies  this  initial  burden,  the  nonmoving  party  must \n24  identify specific facts showing that there is a genuine dispute for trial.  Celotex, 477 U.S. \n25  at 324.  This requires โmore than simply show[ing] that there is some metaphysical doubt \n26  as to the material facts.โ  Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, \n27  586 (1986).  Rather, to survive summary judgment, the nonmoving party must โby her own \n28  affidavits, or by the โdepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,โ \n5 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8268   Page 6 of 59\n \n1  designate โspecific factsโโ that would allow a reasonable fact finder to return a verdict for \n2  the non-moving party.  Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324; Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248.  The non-\n3  moving party cannot oppose a properly supported summary judgment motion by โrest[ing] \n4  on mere allegations or denials of his pleadings.โ Anderson, 477 U.S. at 256. \n5  II.  Analysis \n6  Plaintiffs seek summary adjudication as to (1) their status as โemployeesโ under \n7  California law, and (2) Defendantโs liability to them under California Labor Code sections \n8  226 and 1194 and Industrial Welfare Commission (โIWCโ) Wage Order No. 5-2001.  See \n9  ECF No. 97 at 2.  Defendant contends that Plaintiffsโ motion must be denied because the \n10  โone-way intervention ruleโ precludes Plaintiffs from seeking summary judgment before \n11  class  certification.2    ECF  No.  133  at  3โ4.    Plaintiffs  respond  that  โthe  โone-way \n12  interventionโ rule is a procedural red herring.โ  ECF No. 141 at 9.   \n13  The one-way intervention rule is intended โto protect defendants from unfair โone-\n14  way intervention,โ where the members of a class not yet certified can wait for the courtโs \n15  ruling on summary judgment and either opt in to a favorable ruling or avoid being bound \n16  by an unfavorable one.โ  Villa v. San Francisco Forty-Niners, Ltd., 104 F. Supp. 3d 1017, \n17  1021 (N.D. Cal. 2015) (citing Am. Pipe & Const. Co. v. Utah, 414 U.S. 538, 547 (1974)).  \n18  The one-way intervention rule is supported by โ[t]he purpose of Rule 23(c)(2)[, which] is \n19  to ensure that the plaintiff class receives notice of the action well before the merits of the \n20  case are adjudicated.โ  Schwarzschild v. Tse, 69 F.3d 293, 295 (9th Cir. 1995).  This \n21  purpose is the result of the โ1966 amendments [that] were designed, in part, specifically to \n22  mend this perceived defect in the former Rule and to assure that members of the class \n23  would be identified before trial on the merits and would be bound by all subsequent orders \n24  and judgments.โ  Am. Pipe & Const. Co., 414 U.S. at 547.   \n25                                                                   \n26  2 Defendant also asks the Court to deny or defer ruling on Plaintiffsโ Motion for Partial Summary \nJudgment until Defendant has had the opportunity to conduct โ[e]ssential [m]erits [d]iscovery.โ  ECF No. \n27 \n133 at 6โ10.  Although the Court tends to agree with Plaintiffs that Defendant has not made the requisite \nshowing under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d), see ECF No. 141 at 2โ8, the Court need not reach \n28 \nthe issue because the one-way intervention rule is dispositive. \n6 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8269   Page 7 of 59\n \n1  While the one-way intervention rule typically precludes a court from ruling on a \n2  merits-based motion before the class is certified and notified, see Schwarzschild, 69 F.3d \n3  at 296, there is an exception โwhen early resolution of a motion for summary judgment \n4  seems likely to protect both the parties and the court from needless and costly further \n5  litigation.โ  Wright v. Schock, 742 F.2d 541, 544 (9th Cir. 1984).  However, โ[d]efendants \n6  must consent to this procedure, as the judgment against the individual plaintiff โwill not be \n7  res judicata as to other individual plaintiffs or other members of any class that may be \n8  certified.โโ  Schwarz v. Meinberg, No. CV1300356BROPLAX, 2016 WL 9115353, at *2 \n9  (C.D. Cal. July 15, 2016) (quoting Wright, 742 F.2d at 544); see also Flo & Eddie, Inc. v. \n10  Sirius XM Radio, Inc., No. 13-5693 PSG (RZX), 2015 WL 4476932, at *4 (C.D. Cal. May \n11  27, 2015).  \n12  The Court concludes that the one-way intervention rule applies here.  The class was \n13  neither certified nor notified prior to Plaintiffsโ filing of their Motion for Partial Summary \n14  Judgment; consequently, a ruling on the merits is premature because it has the potential to \n15  leave Defendant open to โbeing pecked to deathโ by plaintiffs seeking an alternative \n16  outcome.  See Fireside Bank v. Super. Ct., 40 Cal. 4th 1069, 1078 (2007) (quoting Premier \n17  Elec. Constr. Co. v. Natโl Elec. Contractors Assโn, Inc., 814 F.2d 358, 363 (7th Cir. 1987)).  \n18  Further, the exception does not apply here because Defendant did not consent to a pre-\n19  certification ruling on Plaintiffsโ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment.  See ECF No. 133 \n20  at 4 (โCoreCivic has not consentedโand does not consentโto the adjudication of these \n21  merits issues before a class-certification ruling.โ) (citing Gessele v. Jack in the Box, Inc., \n22  No. 3:10-cv-960-ST, 2012 WL 3686274, at *3 (D. Or. Aug. 24, 2012)). \n23  Because โthere is no reason the briefing on the MPSJ could not have been completed \n24  already as scheduled,โ Plaintiffs suggest that the Court defer ruling on its Motion, without \n25  allowing  Defendant  a  second  opportunity  to  brief  the  merits,  until  after  the  class \n26  certification procedures have been completed.  ECF No. 141 at 9โ10.  But Plaintiffs do not \n27  cite, and the Court has not found, any authority supporting Plaintiffsโ request.  See Gomez \n28  v. Rossi Concrete Inc., No. 08CV1442 BTM CAB, 2011 WL 666888, at *2 (S.D. Cal. Feb. \n7 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8270   Page 8 of 59\n \n1  17, 2011) (denying pre-certification motion for summary judgement without prejudice); \n2  see also Villa, 104 F. Supp. 3d at 1023 (same).  Further, Defendant should not be penalized \n3  for asserting its rights under the one-intervention rule.   \n4  Consequently, the Court DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE Plaintiffsโ Motion for \n5  Partial Summary Judgment.  Should Plaintiffs elect to renew their Motion for Partial \n6  Summary  Judgment  following  the  Courtโs  resolution  of  their  Motion  for  Class \n7  Certification, Defendant must either respond on the merits or โidentify specific facts to be \n8  obtained in discovery that [a]re essential to oppose summary judgment.โ  See Leonard v. \n9  Baker, 714 F. Appโx 718, 719 (9th Cir. 2018) (citing Family Home & Fin. Ctr., Inc. v. Fed. \n10  Home Loan Mortg. Corp., 525 F.3d 822, 827 (9th Cir. 2008)). \n11  DEFENDANTโS MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS \n12  I.  Legal Standard \n13  Any party may move for judgment on the pleadings โ[a]fter the pleadings are \n14  closedโbut early enough not to delay trial.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c).  A motion for judgment \n15  on the pleadings attacks the legal sufficiency of the claims alleged in the complaint.  See \n16  Patel v. Contemporary Classics of Beverly Hills, 259 F.3d 123, 126 (2d Cir. 2001).  The \n17  Court must construe โall material allegations of the non-moving party as contained in the \n18  pleadings as true, and [construe] the pleadings in the light most favorable to the [non-\n19  moving] party.โ  Doyle v. Raleyโs Inc., 158 F.3d 1012, 1014 (9th Cir. 1998).  โJudgment \n20  on the pleadings is proper when the moving party clearly establishes on the face of the \n21  pleadings that no material issue of fact remains to be resolved and that it is entitled to \n22  judgment as a matter of law.โ  Hal Roach Studios, Inc. v. Richard Feiner & Co., Inc., 896 \n23  F.2d 1542, 1550 (9th Cir. 1990).  โAnalysis under Rule 12(c) is โsubstantially identicalโ to \n24  analysis under Rule 12(b)(6) because, under both rules, โa court must determine whether \n25  the facts alleged in the complaint, taken as true, entitle the plaintiff to a legal remedy.โโ  \n26  Chavez v. United States, 683 F.3d 1102, 1108 (9th Cir. 2012). \n27  / / / \n28  / / / \n8 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8271   Page 9 of 59\n \n1  II.  Analysis \n2  Defendant requests that the Court โgrant judgment on the pleadings and dismiss all \n3  putative class claims that arose outside of California for lack of personal jurisdiction.โ  ECF \n4  No. 117 at 2; see also ECF No. 117-1 at 1, 9.  Defendant contends that โcourts have \n5  approved such jurisdictional challenges at the class-certification stage.โ  ECF No. 117-1 at \n6  1 (citing Gasser v. Kiss My Face, LLC, No. 17-CV-01675-JSC, 2018 WL 4538729, at *2 \n7  (N.D. Cal. Sept. 21, 2018)). \n8  Plaintiffs urge the Court to โdeny Defendantโs Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings \n9  . . . because it is a procedurally improper, belated personal jurisdiction challenge Defendant \n10  should have raised two years ago when litigation began, and which Defendant waived due \n11  to its failure to do so.โ  ECF No. 134 at 1.  Specifically, Plaintiffs argue that โDefendant \n12  waived its challenge by failing to raise it in the prior Rule 12(b) motion, and through its \n13  extensive litigation conduct.โ  Id. at 2. \n14  Defendant responds that it did not waive its personal jurisdiction defense because \n15  โpersonal jurisdiction is waived only if it was both available and omitted from the earlier \n16  motion.โ  ECF No. 140 at 1 (emphasis in original).  Defendant contends that the personal \n17  jurisdiction defense was not available to it at the time it filed its Rule 12(b) motion to \n18  dismiss because โCoreCivic had no good faith basis to challenge personal jurisdiction over \n19  the non-plaintiff, putative class membersโ claimsโ prior to class certification, see id., \n20  rendering โany personal jurisdiction challenge to the putative class membersโ claims . . . \n21  premature and procedurally improper at the motion-to-dismiss stage.โ  Id. at 2. \n22  The  Court  concludes  that  Defendant  has  waived  any  challenge  to  the  Courtโs \n23  personal jurisdiction.  โโLack of personal jurisdictionโ is a โdefense to a claim for reliefโ \n24  that the Federal Rules expressly recognize.โ  McCurley v. Royal Seas Cruises, Inc., 331 \n25  F.R.D. 142, 164 (S.D. Cal. 2019) (quoting Fed. R. Civ.

Bristol-Myers  Squibb  was  decided  on  June  19,  2017,  and \n12  Defendant did not respond to Plaintiffsโ initial Complaint until August 11, 2017, see ECF \n13  No. 18, or answer Plaintiffโs initial Complaint until June 8, 2018.

Mar. 10, 2020)), the legal basis for \n17  the defense was known to the Defendant when it responded to Plaintiffโs initial Complaint, \n18  thereby  rendered  the  personal  jurisdiction  defense  available.    Consequently, \n19  โ[Defendant]โs failure to assert personal jurisdiction in its first responsive pleadings to \n20  [Plaintiffsโ] original complaint[] constitutes a waiver of such a defense.โ  See McCurley, \n21  331 F.R.D. at 165; see also Mussat v.

The Court therefore DENIES Defendantโs Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. \n25  PLAINTIFFSโ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n26  I.  Legal Standard \n27  Motions for class certification proceed under Rule 23(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil \n28  Procedure. Rule 23(a) provides four prerequisites to a class action:  (1) the class is so \n10 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8273   Page 11 of 59\n \n1  numerous  that  joinder  of  all  members  is  impracticable  (โnumerosityโ),  (2)  there  are \n2  questions of law or fact common to the class (โcommonalityโ), (3) the claims or defenses \n3  of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class (โtypicalityโ), \n4  and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class \n5  (โadequate representationโ).  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n6  A proposed class must also satisfy one of the subdivisions of Rule 23(b).  Here, \n7  Plaintiffs seek to proceed under Rule 23(b)(3), which requires that โthe court find[] that \n8  the  [common  questions]  predominate  over  any  questions  affecting  only  individual \n9  members [โpredominanceโ], and that a class action is superior to other available methods \n10  for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy [โsuperiorityโ].โ  The relevant factors \n11  in this inquiry include the class membersโ interest in individually controlling the litigation, \n12  other litigation already commenced, the desirability (or not) of consolidating the litigation \n13  in this forum, and manageability.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)(A)โ(D). \n14  โIn determining the propriety of a class action, the question is not whether the \n15  plaintiff or plaintiffs have stated a cause of action or will prevail on the merits, but rather \n16  whether the requirements of Rule 23 are met.โ  Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. \n17  156, 178 (1974) (internal quotations omitted).  โRule 23 does not set forth a mere pleading \n18  standard.โ  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011).  Rather, โ[a] party \n19  seeking class certification must affirmatively demonstrate his compliance with the Ruleโ\n20  that is, he must be prepared to prove that there are in fact sufficiently numerous parties, \n21  common questions of law or fact, etc.โ  Id.  The court is โat liberty to consider evidence \n22  which goes to the requirements of Rule 23 even though the evidence may also relate to the \n23  underlying merits of the case.โ  Hanon v. Dataprods. Corp., 976 F.2d 497, 509 (9th Cir. \n24  1992).  A weighing of competing evidence, however, is inappropriate at this stage of the \n25  litigation.  Staton v. Boeing Co., 327 F.3d 938, 954 (9th Cir. 2003). \n26  II.

Preliminary Considerations \n2  Before addressing the Rule 23(a) and Rule 23(b)(3) factors, the Court addresses \n3  Defendantโs  arguments  concerning  the  certification  of  the  Basic  Necessities  Classes, \n4  Plaintiffsโ standing to pursue prospective equitable relief, and the ascertainability of the \n5  proposed classes. \n6  1.  The Basic Necessities Classes \n7  As an initial matter, Defendant contends that โ[t]he Court cannot certify the Basic \n8  Necessities Classes because it โis bound to class definitions provided in the complaint and, \n9  absent an amended complaint, will not consider certification beyond it.โโ  ECF No. 118 at \n10  13 (citing Reyes v. Educ. Credit Mgmt. Corp., 322 F.R.D. 552, 559 (S.D. Cal. 2017) \n11  (quoting Costelo v. Chertoff, 258 F.R.D. 600, 605 (C.D. Cal. 2009)), vacated & remanded \n12  on other grounds, 773 Fed.

Defendant notes that, โ[a]lthough a Court is \n14  not precluded from considering a new class โthat is narrower than the class definition \n15  originally proposed,โ . . . Plaintiffsโ Basic Necessities Classes involve an entirely different \n16  theory of liability, based on factual allegations that simply do not exist in the Complaint.โ  \n17  Id. at 13โ14 (quoting Bee, Denning, 310 F.R.D. at 621) (emphasis in original). \n18  Plaintiffs counter that โthe CA and National Basic Necessities Classes assert the \n19  same theories of liability that Plaintiffs alleged in the FACโnamely, violations of the CA \n20  TVPA, Federal TVPA, and UCL, as well as unjust enrichment and negligence.โ  ECF No. \n21  127 at 6.  โFurther, the Basic Necessities Classes are also defined more narrowly than the \n22  Nationwide and California Forced Labor Classes alleged in the FAC, which refer to โ[a]ll \n23  civil immigration detainees who performed Forced Laborโ generally, without any limiting \n24  principle,โ whereas โthe Basic Necessities Classes tether the definition of โForced Laborโ \n25  to  ICE  detainees  that  worked  through  CoreCivicโs  VWP  and  purchased  basic  living \n26  necessities at the commissary.โ  Id. at 6โ7 (quoting FAC ยถ 30; ECF No. 84 at 1โ2). \n27  โGenerally, a plaintiff may only seek to certify a class as defined in a complaintโ\n28  courts  will  not  certify  classes  different  from,  or  broader  than,  a  class  alleged  in  the \n13 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8276   Page 14 of 59\n \n1  complaint without plaintiff moving to amend the complaint.โ  Richie v. Blue Shield of Cal., \n2  No. C-13-2693 EMC, 2014 WL 6982943, at *13 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 9, 2014) (citing Savanna \n3  Grp., Inc. v. Trynex, Inc., No. 10-cv-7995, 2013 WL 66181, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 4, 2013); \n4  Costelo, 258 F.R.D. at 604โ05).  Despite Plaintiffsโ assertion that the Basic Necessities \n5  Classes are โdefined more narrowlyโ than the Forced Labor Classes alleged in their First \n6  Amended Complaint, the Court concludes that those classes are new classes hinging on \n7  allegations not appearing in the First Amended Complaint. \n8  The First Amended Complaintโs only reference to the commissary is that โPlaintiffs \n9  and detainees are/were only allowed to spend their $1 per day at the CoreCivic โcompany \n10  storeโ or commissary.โ  FAC ยถ 15.  This is entirely different than alleging that Plaintiffs \n11  had to spend their earnings at the commissary on basic necessities that were not provided \n12  by Defendant.  Indeed, the only mention of โbasic necessitiesโ is made in Defendantโs \n13  Counter-Claim.  See, e.g., ECF No. 70 at 31 ยถ 13 (โCoreCivic provides basic necessities to \n14  all detainees housed in its California facilities, including but not limited to housing, food, \n15  clothing, and recreation.โ); id. at 33 ยถ 23 (same); id. at 35 ยถ 33 (โThe work performed by \n16  these  detainees  is  performed  for  reasons  other  than  compensation,  as  detainees \n17  participating in the [VWP] do not participate in commerce and do not depend on the wages \n18  they earn for basic necessities such as, for example, housing, food, clothing, and recreation, \n19  while detained, as those necessities are provided to them at taxpayer expense.โ); id. at \n20  Prayer ยถ D (requesting โan order awarding CoreCivic all costs and expenses incurred in \n21  providing  basic  necessities  to  Counter-Defendants  and  the  putative  class  members, \n22  including but not limited to housing, food, clothing, and recreationโ).   \n23  If Plaintiffs uncovered the โbasic necessitiesโ theory of liability during discovery, \n24  they should have diligently sought leave to amend their First Amended Complaint to assert \n25  it.  See, e.g., Stuart v. Radioshack Corp., No. C-07-4499 EMC, 2009 WL 281941, at *2 \n26  (N.D. Cal.

But this Plaintiffs failed to do.  In her July 27, 2018 Scheduling \n4  Order, Magistrate Judge Stormes imposed a deadline of October 26, 2018, by which to file \n5  โ[a]ny motion to join other parties, to amend the pleadings, or to file additional pleadings.โ  \n6  ECF No. 57 ยถ 3.  On September 11, 2018, Plaintiffs sought leave to file the operative First \n7  Amended Complaint, see ECF No. 64, which does not mention the provision ofโlet alone \n8  the alleged forced purchase ofโbasic necessities.  See generally FAC.  Plaintiffs did not \n9  seek leave to modify the Scheduling Order to add these allegations either before or after \n10  filing the instant Motion for Class Certification, and they do not even attempt to make a \n11  showing of good cause for allowing them to amend their class allegations at this stage.  See \n12  Ortiz, 2009 WL 1322962, at *2 (setting forth good cause standard under Rule 16(b) for \n13  modification of scheduling order and concluding that the plaintiffs failed to exercise \n14  diligence or make a showing of good cause); see also infra note 5. \n15  Accordingly, the Court DENIES Plaintiffsโ Motion for Class Certification as to the \n16  California and Nationwide Basic Necessities Classes, which were neither included in nor \n17  narrower than the classes alleged in Plaintiffsโ First Amended Complaint.

Standing \n6   In the context of a putative class action, the plaintiff bears the burden of showing \n7  that at least one named plaintiff meets the requirements for Article III standing as to each \n8  form of relief sought.  See Ellis v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 657 F.3d 970, 978 (9th Cir. \n9  2011) (citing Bates v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 511 F.3d 974, 985 (9th Cir. 2007)).     \n10  Here, it is undisputed that Plaintiffs have Article III standing for their claims for \n11  monetary damages, restitution, interest, penalties, punitive damages, and fees and costs.  \n12  See ECF No. 144 at 1โ2; ECF No. 148 at 2, 8.  In addition, however, Plaintiffs seek \n13  declaratory relief as to their causes of action for violation of the TVPA and the California \n14  TVPA, see FAC ยถยถ 35(g), 39(c), 46, 58; see also id. Prayer ยถ b, as well as injunctive relief \n15  as to their causes of action for violation of the TVPA, the California TVPA, and the UCL.  \n16  See FAC ยถยถ 35(e) & (g), 39(c), 47โ48, 59โ60, 69; see also id. Prayer ยถ c.  To establish \n17  standing  for  such  prospective  equitable  relief,  the  plaintiff  must  be  able  to  show  โa \n18  significant likelihood that she will be wronged again in a similar way.โ  Ellis, 657 F.3d at \n19  978 (citing Bates, 511 F.3d at 985). \n20  Mr. Owinoโs detention, however, ended on March 9, 2015, see ECF No. 84-3 ยถ 2, \n21  and Mr. Gomezโs on September 18, 2013,4 see ECF No. 84-4 ยถ 2, well before their initial \n22  complaint was filed on May 31, 2017, see generally ECF No. 1, and the operative First \n23 \n24                                                                   \n25  4 Plaintiffsโ status as former participants in the VWP presents other issues unrelated to standing.  For \nexample, Plaintiffs assert a claim for waiting time penalties, see FAC ยถยถ 94โ96; however, such penalties \n26  โwould be due to severed or terminated class members if Defendant[] were found liable on any of \nthe class claims,โ Lusby v.

Named Plaintiffsโ Standing \n8  In their supplemental brief, Plaintiffs contend that, โeven through Plaintiffs were \n9  released from CoreCivicโs custody prior to the filing of their original complaint, Plaintiffs \n10  nonetheless have Article III standing to pursue their claims for prospective equitable reliefโ \n11  because โ[t]he Supreme Court has recognized that โ[t]he violation of a procedural right \n12  granted by statute can be sufficient in some circumstances to constitute injury in fact.โ  \n13  ECF No. 144 at 3 (alteration in original) (quoting Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. ___, \n14  136 S. Ct. 1540, 1543 (2016)).  โBecause Plaintiffs were actually harmed by conduct \n15  proscribed by statute, and those statutes authorize prospective relief, Plaintiffs possess \n16  Article III standing to pursue recovery in the form of injunctive and declaratory relief on \n17  behalf of themselves and the proposed classes.โ  Id. at 4 (citing Ingalls v. Spotify USA, Inc., \n18  No. C 16-03533 WHA, 2017 WL 3021037, at *7 (N.D. Cal. July 17, 2017)). \n19  Defendant counters that โa statute does not automatically confer Article III standing \n20  simply because the statute authorizes prospective relief,โ ECF No. 145 at 3โ4 (citing Rivas \n21  v. Rail Delivery Servs., Inc., 423 F.3d 1079, 1083 (9th Cir. 2005)), and โPlaintiffs lack \n22  standing because they were not โexposed to a โreal and immediate threatโ of future injury \n23  at the time they filed their original Complaint.โ  Id. at 3 (citing Nordstrom v. Ryan, 856 \n24  F.3d 1265, 1270 n.2 (9th Cir. 2017)).     \n25  Defendant is correct that Spokeo does not relieve Plaintiffs seeking prospective \n26  equitable relief from establishing a sufficient likelihood of future harm, see, e.g., Joslin v. \n27  Clif Bar & Co., No. 4:18-CV-04941-JSW, 2019 WL 5690632, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 26, \n28  2019) (recognizing after Spokeo that, โto show they have standing to seek injunctive relief, \n17 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8280   Page 18 of 59\n \n1  Plaintiffs must โdemonstrate that [they have] suffered or [are] threatened with a โconcrete \n2  and particularizedโ legal harm, coupled with a โsufficient likelihood that [they] will again \n3  be wronged in a similar wayโโ) (quoting Bates v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 511 F.3d 974, \n4  985 (9th Cir. 2007)), and the Court concludes that Plaintiffsโ have failed to make the \n5  requisite showing.  There are no allegations in the First Amended Complaint regarding \n6  Plaintiffsโ likelihood of being detained at a CoreCivic facility in the future.  See generally \n7  FAC; see also ECF No. 144 at 5โ6 (โPlaintiffs respectfully submit to the Court that they \n8  can amend the FAC to add . . . allegations[ that] would clarify Plaintiffsโ . . . โsufficient \n9  likelihoodโ . . . [of] be[ing] detained at a CoreCivic facility in the future.โ). The Court \n10  therefore concludes that Plaintiffs have failed to establish Article III standing to seek \n11  injunctive relief in the operative First Amended Complaint. \n12      b.  Redressability Through Amendment \n13  Because the Court determines that they have failed to establish standing to seek \n14  prospective  equitable  relief,  Plaintiffs  request  leave  to  amend  their  First  Amended \n15  Complaint to add new allegations regarding the โโsufficient likelihoodโ that both Plaintiffs \n16  will be detained at a CoreCivic facility in the future and subject to CoreCivicโs challenged \n17  policies and practices,โ See ECF No. 144 at 6 (citing Davidson v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., \n18  873 F.3d 1103, 1113 (9th Cir. 2017)), or to add a new class representative.  See id. at 7โ9.  \n19  Plaintiffs note that their โcounsel have been retained by a former detainee and putative \n20  class member, Achiri Nelson Geh, who was subject to and harmed by the same policies \n21  and practices as Plaintiffs while detained at Otay Mesa Detention Center [(โOMDCโ)] \n22  between April 24, 2017[,] and October 28, 2019.โ  Id. at 7.  Additionally, โthere are putative \n23  class members who are presently detained at CoreCivicโs facilities who also have Article \n24  III standing to assert a claim for prospective equitable relief.โ  Id. at 8. \n25  Defendant responds that amendment would be futile because Plaintiffs have โwaived \n26  any classwide prospective reliefโ by โfail[ing] to seek certification of the putative classes \n27  pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2).โ  ECF No. 145 at 5.  Further, โPlaintiffs do not even try to meet \n28  their burden under Rule 15 for amending pleadings.โ  ECF No. 145 at 7 (citing Foman v. \n18 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8281   Page 19 of 59\n \n1  Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962)).  In any event, โadd[ing] a new class representative \n2  cannot resurrect the class claims for prospective relief,โ id. at 6 (citing Lierboe v. State \n3  Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 350 F.3d 1018, 1023 (9th Cir. 2013)), and Mr. Gehโas a former \n4  detainee himselfโโwould not be a proper substitute anyway.โ  Id. at 6 n.3.  Mr. Owinoโs \n5  and Mr. Gomezโs proposed amendments also โfall woefully short of establishing a โreal \n6  and immediate threat of repeated injury.โโ  Id. at 7 (quoting Fortyune v. Am. Multi-Cinema, \n7  Inc., 364 F.3d 1075, 1081 (9th Cir. 2004)). \n8  On reply, Plaintiffs respond that they have not โโwaivedโ their claims for prospective \n9  equitable relief by moving for class certification under Rule 23(b)(3)โ because โcourts \n10  routinely certify classes seeking both damages and prospective equitable relief under Rule \n11  23(b)(3)โ and seeking certification under Rule 23(b)(2) would be โquestionable . . . given \n12  the significance of the proposed classesโ claims for damages.โ  ECF No. 148 at 1.  Plaintiffs \n13  also reiterate that โthere is โa sufficient likelihood that [plaintiff] will again be wronged in \n14  a similar way,โโ id. at 9 (quoting Davidson, 873 F.3d at 1113) (alteration in original), and \n15  that โother members of the putative class can be substituted into the case as named \n16  Plaintiffs in the event the Court finds that Plaintiffs do not possess Article III standing to \n17  pursue  prospective  equitable  relief,โ  including  Mr.  Geh;  โall  named  plaintiffs  in  the \n18  currently stayed action Gonzalez, et al. v. CoreCivic, Inc., Case No. 17-CV-2573 JLS \n19  (NLS)โ; and any of the โhundreds of putative class members who are currently incarcerated \n20  at CoreCivicโs facilities.โ  Id. at 9โ10.     \n21  The Court concludes that Plaintiffs cannot cure Mr. Owinoโs and Mr. Gomezโs lack \n22  of standing through amendment.  First, the Court agrees with Defendant that amendment \n23  would be futile as to Mr. Owino and Mr. Gomez because their proposed amendments fail \n24  to allege a sufficient likelihood of future harm.  Although the Court acknowledges and \n25  agrees that Mr. Owino and Mr. Gomez โhave reasonable, deeply held concerns and fears \n26  that they will be detained in the future,โ see ECF No. 144 at 6 (citing ECF No. 144-1  \n27  ยถยถ 6โ11; ECF No. 144-2 ยถยถ 6โ13), their proposed amendments fall short of establishing \n28  that repeat detention is โcertainly impending.โ  See Davidson, 873 F.3d at 1113.  As \n19 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8282   Page 20 of 59\n \n1  Defendant notes, Mr. โOwino has been out of ICE custody for four years, [Mr.] Gomez has \n2  been out of ICE custody for six years, and neither has been arrested or detained by ICE \n3  sinceโeven in the 2 ยฝ years after filings this lawsuit.โ  ECF No. 145 at 8 (citing ECF No. \n4  144-1 ยถ 3; ECF No. 144-2 ยถ 3).  Accordingly, even if the Court were to permit amendment,5 \n5 \n                                                                 \n6 \n5 Defendant is also correct that Plaintiffs have not attempted to make the requisite showing for leave to \n7 \namend.  See ECF No. 145 at 7.  Although Defendant analyzes the propriety of amendment under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 15, see id., Magistrate Judge Stormes set a deadline to amend the pleadings of \n8 \nOctober 26, 2018.  See ECF No. 57 ยถ 3.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs must establish โgood causeโ to modify \n9  Magistrate Judge Stormesโ scheduling order pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16(b)(4).  See, \ne.g., Johnson v. Mammoth Recreations, Inc., 975 F.2d 604, 608โ09 (9th Cir. 1992).  โUnlike Rule 15(a)โs \n10  liberal amendment policy[,] which focuses on the bad faith of the party seeking to interpose an amendment \nand the prejudice to the opposing party, Rule 16(b)โs โgood causeโ standard primarily considers the \n11 \ndiligence of the party seeking the amendment.โ  Id. at 609.  If the party seeking to modify the scheduling \norder โwas not diligent, the inquiry should end.โ  Id.  โ[C]ourts often find good cause when the motion to \n12 \namend the scheduling order is based upon new and pertinent information,โ but not where the amendment \n13  is โbased on information that ha[s] been available to [the party] throughout the suit.โ  Lyon v. U.S. \nImmigration & Customs Enfโt, 308 F.R.D. 203, 216 (N.D. Cal. 2015) (citing Johnson, 975 F.2d at 609; \n14  Pumpco, Inc. v. Schenker Intโl, Inc., 204 F.R.D. 667, 668 (D.

Quaker Oats Co., 232 F.3d 1271, 1294โ95 (9th Cir. \n2000) (affirming denial of motion to amend where plaintiffs โfailed to show diligenceโ).  That alone \n20 \nsuffices to end the Courtโs good cause inquiry, see Johnson, 975 F.2d at 609; see also Hoffman, 315 F.R.D. \n21  at 336; however, despite Plaintiffsโ well-founded objections to access to Defendantโs detainees, see Tr. at \n53:21โ57:12, they have been in possession of all facts relevant to their standing since the inception of this \n22  suit and, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, had an affirmative duty to investigate the \ntheoretical underpinnings  of  their complaintโincluding  their  standingโbefore  filing.    See  Soto  v. \n23 \nCastlerock Farming & Transp., Inc., No. 1:09-CV-00701 AWI, 2011 WL 3489876, at *7 (E.D. Cal. Aug. \n9, 2011) (โPlaintiffs have known the causes of action since at least the filing of the first complaint in 2005, \n24 \nand named [the named plaintiffs] as the class representatives in 2009.

Fidell, 26 Fed. Appโx 630, 631โ32 (9th Cir. 2001) (affirming \n26  imposition of Rule 11 sanctions where complaint was filed by plaintiffs lacking standing).  Accordingly, \ndenial of leave to amend to cure Plaintiffsโ standing is appropriate.  See, e.g., In re W.

See, e.g., Mendia v. Garcia, 165 F. Supp. 3d 861, \n3  895 (N.D. Cal. 2016) (โAlthough Plaintiff articulates his fear of being subject to another \n4  immigration detainer, he does not explain why or how this is likely to occur again.โ); \n5  Diamond v.

Plaintiffsโ \n8  alleged threat of injury would first require their arrest and placement in custody at an \n9  Alameda County jail.โ). \n10  Second, the proposed amendment would also be futile as to Mr. Geh.  Although \n11  Mr. Geh was detained when this action and the operative First Amended Complaint were \n12  filed, that does not mean that he would have standing as of the date of a future amendment \n13  to add him as a named plaintiff.  While generally โ[s]tanding is determined by the facts \n14  that exist at the time the complaint is filed,โ Gonzalez v. Immigration & Customs Enfโt, \n15  No. CV1304416BROFFMX, 2014 WL 12605369, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 24, 2014) (quoting \n16  Clark v.

(citing Lynch v. Leis, 382 F.3d 642, 647 (6th Cir. 2004)).  Consequently, Mr. Geh โhas \n20  no standingโ because โhe is not currently detained [at OMDC] or in ICE custody.โ  See \n21  ECF No. 145 at 6 n.3 (emphasis in original) (citing ECF No. 144-3 ยถยถ 2, 16). \n22  Third, Defendant is correct that substitution of one of the named plaintiffs in the \n23  Gonzalez action or another current CoreCivic detainee would be improper under these \n24  circumstances.  See ECF No. 145 at 6.  โIn a complaint involving multiple claims, at least \n25  one named plaintiff must have Article III standing for each asserted claim.โ  Hoffman, 315 \n26  F.R.D. at 333 (emphasis in original) (citing In re Carrier IQ, Inc., Consumer Privacy Litig., \n27  78 F.

Exs. 45โ50 & 88, ECF Nos. 85-46โ51 \n21  & 85-89 (public redacted versions), ECF Nos. 87-33โ38 & 87-76 (sealed versions)).  This \n22  is because โ[t]he CA Forced Labor Class and the National Forced Labor Class arise out of \n23  CoreCivicโs policy and practice of requiring โallโ ICE detainees at its facilities to perform \n24  cleaning  work  outside  of  the  ICE  detaineesโ  immediate  living  areas  under  threat  of \n25  discipline,โ meaning those โclasses will necessarily include several thousands of former \n26  and current ICE detainees, and the requirement of numerosity is satisfied.โ  Id. at 16 \n27  (emphasis in original). \n28  / / / \n24 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8287   Page 25 of 59\n \n1  Defendant counters that Plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden because โ[a] \n2  higher level of proof than mere common[-]sense impression or extrapolation from cursory \n3  allegations  is  required.โ    ECF  No.  118  at  18  (quoting  Allen  v.  Similasan  Corp. \n4  (โSimilasanโ), 306 F.R.D. 635, 681 (S.D. Cal. 2015)) (alteration in original).  Regarding \n5  the California Labor Law Class, for example, the exhibits to which Plaintiffs cite โidentify \n6  only 55 detainees who received an account deposit for โJob Pay[,]โโ and โPlaintiffs fail to \n7  identify the number of detainees who were eligible for, but did not receive, a rest period, \n8  meal  period,  or  overtime  wages.โ    Id.  at  18โ19.    Similarly,  Plaintiffsโ  โspeculation \n9  [regarding  the  sizes  of  the  Force  Labor  Classes]  does  not  satisfy  the  numerosity \n10  requirement.โ  Id. at 20 (citing Schwartz v. Upper Deck Co., 183 F.R.D. 672, 681 (S.D. \n11  Cal. 1999)). \n12  Plaintiffs rejoin that โ[t]he numerosity requirement is satisfied for each proposed \n13  class.โ  ECF No. 127 at 9.  As for the California Labor Law Class, โPlaintiffs filed excerpts \n14  of the OMS reports because their size renders them nearly impossible to file on the public \n15  docket.โ  Id.  As for the Forced Labor Classes, โeach will necessarily include several \n16  thousands of former and current ICE detaineesโ because they โarise out of CoreCivicโs \n17  policy and practice of requiring โallโ ICE detainees to perform cleaning work outside of \n18  the ICE detaineesโ immediate living areas under threat of discipline.โ  Id. at 10 (emphasis \n19  in original). \n20  The  Court  concludes  that  Plaintiffs  have  satisfied  Rule  23(a)โs  numerosity \n21  requirement for the California Labor Law Class, the California Forced Labor Class, and \n22  the Nationwide Forced Labor Class.  Plaintiffs need not prove the identity of each class \n23  member at the class certification stage, see, e.g., Allen v. Hylandโs Inc. (โHylandโsโ), 300 \n24  F.R.D. 643, 658 (C.D. Cal. 2014), and the Court concludes that it is readily apparent from \n25  the number of ICE detainees Defendant has housed in its various facilities in California \n26  and nationwide over the years at issue that the classes are so numerous that it would be \n27  impracticable to join all parties here.  See, e.g., Similasan, 306 F.R.D. at 644 (concluding \n28  that it was โreadily apparent that the class is so numerous that it would be impracticable to \n25 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8288   Page 26 of 59\n \n1  join  all  partiesโ  where  the  โ[d]efendant  sells  its  Products  through  at  least  thirteen \n2  retailersโ); Hylandโs, 300 F.R.D. at 660 (finding that numerosity โis easily satisfied given \n3  that the putative class action includes consumers of twelve products sold nationwide over \n4  the course of several yearsโ). \n5    2.  Commonality \n6  Rule 23(a)(2) requires that โthere are questions of law or fact common to the class.โ  \n7  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2).  To satisfy this requirement, โ[a]ll questions of fact and law need \n8  not be common to satisfy the rule.  The existence of shared legal issues with divergent \n9  factual predicates is sufficient, as is a common core of salient facts coupled with disparate \n10  legal remedies within the class.โ  Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1019 (9th Cir. \n11  1998).  The common contention, however, โmust be of such a nature that it is capable of \n12  classwide resolutionโwhich means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an \n13  issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.โ  Wal-Mart, 564 \n14  U.S. at 350. \n15  Plaintiffs argue that their โclaims all hinge on common contentions that are capable \n16  of classwide resolution.โ  ECF No. 87 at 16.  Defendant contends that Plaintiffs have failed \n17  to establish that Defendant has policies or practices common to all putative class members, \n18  see ECF No. 118 at 25โ29, and that individual questions predominate.  See id. at 29โ33.  \n19  Because  Plaintiffs  and  Defendant  have  collapsed  their  arguments  concerning  the \n20  predominance of common issues under Rule 23(b)(3) with their discussion of commonality \n21  under Rule 23(a)(2), compare ECF No. 87 at 24; and ECF No. 127 at 10โ12, with ECF No. \n22  118 at 24โ33, the Court discusses both commonality and predominance under the โfar more \n23  demandingโ Rule 23(b)(3) predominance analysis.  See infra Section II.C.1; see also ECF \n24  No. 118 at 25 (quoting Amchem Prods. Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 624 (1997)).  \n25    3.  Typicality and Adequacy \n26  The Ninth Circuit has explained that โrepresentative claims are โtypicalโ if they are \n27  reasonably co-extensive with those of absent class members; they need not be substantially \n28  identical.โ  Staton, 327 F.3d at 957; Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1019.  The test of typicality โis \n26 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8289   Page 27 of 59\n \n1  whether other members have the same or similar injury, whether the action is based on \n2  conduct which is not unique to the named plaintiffs, and whether other class members have \n3  been injured by the same course of conduct.โ  Schwartz v. Harp, 108 F.R.D. 279, 282 (C.D. \n4  Cal. 1985). \n5  Rule 23(a)(4) also requires that โthe representative parties will fairly and adequately \n6  protect the interests of the class.โ  โTo determine whether the representation meets this \n7  standard, [courts] ask two questions:  (1) Do the representative plaintiffs and their counsel \n8  have any conflicts of interest with other class members, and (2) will the representative \n9  plaintiffs and their counsel prosecute the action vigorously on behalf of the class?โ  Staton, \n10  327 F.3d at 957. \n11      a.  Representative Plaintiffs \n12  Plaintiffs contend that their โown claims are typical of the classes that they seek to \n13  representโ because, โ[l]ike the putative class members, Plaintiffs were also subject to \n14  CoreCivicโs uniform policies and practices.โ  ECF No. 87 at 22.  Further, Plaintiffs urge \n15  that they will adequately represent the proposed Classes because โPlaintiffs each seek relief \n16  on behalf of the class as a whole and have no interest antagonistic to other class members.โ  \n17  Id. at 23.  Defendant raises several challenges to Mr. Owinoโs and Mr. Gomezโs adequacy \n18  and typicality, see ECF No. 118 at 20โ24, which the Court addresses in turn.   \n19        i.  Membership in the Proposed Classes \n20  First, Defendant argues that neither Mr. Owino nor Mr. Gomez has demonstrated \n21  through his declaration that he is a member of any of the proposed classes he seeks to \n22  represent.  See ECF No. 87 at 21โ22, 23.  Plaintiffs respond that they need โnot specifically \n23  define the dates and times on which the labor law violations occurredโ and that โCoreCivic \n24  failed to submit any documents or records establishing that Plaintiff did not work during \n25  the applicable limitations period in spite of the fact that CoreCivic employed Mr. Owino \n26  and Mr. Gomez and w[as] better positioned (and required by California law) to maintain \n27  such employment records.โ  ECF No. 127 at 12. \n28  / / / \n27 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8290   Page 28 of 59\n \n1  The  Forced  Labor  Classes:    The  Court  concludes  that  both  Mr.  Owino  and \n2  Mr. Gomez have adequately established for purposes of class certification that they are \n3  members of the California and National Forced Labor Classes.  For example, Mr. Owino \n4  and Mr. Gomez both attest that โ[d]etainees were . . . responsible for removing trash from \n5  the common areas of the living pods on a daily basis, sweeping and mopping floors, and \n6  cleaning toilet bowls, sinks, showers, and furniture,โ ECF No. 84-3 ยถ 20 (emphasis added); \n7  ECF No. 84-4 ยถ 16 (emphasis added), and that they โwere not paid for working to clean \n8  the common areas when instructed by OMDC staff.โ  ECF No. 84-3 ยถ 21; ECF No. 84-4 \n9  ยถ 17.  Further, the detainees โalmost always complied,โ ECF No. 84-3 ยถ 23; ECF No. 84-4 \n10  ยถ 19, โto avoid any punishment,โ ECF No. 84-3 ยถ 24; see also ECF No. 84-4 ยถ 20, because \n11  non-compliant detainees โcould be subject to more random and frequent searches and cell \n12  tossing,โ โremoved from the general living pod and placed in more restrictive housing,โ or \n13  saddled with a disciplinary note in their files that โcould negatively impact [their] case \n14  before the judge.โ  ECF No. 84-3 ยถ 23; ECF No. 84-4 ยถ 19.   \n15  The  California  Labor  Law  Class:    The  Court  concludes  that  Mr.  Owino  and \n16  Mr. Gomez  adequately  have  established  that  they  were  never  paid  a  minimum  wage \n17  through the VWP program, see ECF No. 84-3 ยถ 10; ECF No. 84-4 ยถ 8, and that they never \n18  received wage statements.  See ECF No. 84-3 ยถ 13; ECF No. 84-4 ยถ 10.  As such, the Court \n19  also concludes that they have established for purposes of class certification that Defendant \n20  failed to pay compensation upon termination and imposed unlawful terms and conditions \n21  of employment.7 \n22  As for the claims for failure to pay overtime wages and failure to provide mandated \n23  meal and rest periods, however, the Court concludes that Mr. Owino has established that \n24  he is a member of the class for his work in the kitchen but that Mr. Owino and Mr. Gomez \n25  have failed to establish that they are members of the class for any other positions they held \n26 \n                                                                 \n27 \n7 Mr. Owinoโs and Mr. Gomezโs claims for waiting time penalties, however, may not be typical of those \nof the Class to the extent Mr. Owino and Mr. Gomez seek to represent current detainees still participating \n28 \nin the VWP.  See supra note 4. \n28 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8291   Page 29 of 59\n \n1  while detained by Defendant.8  As for Mr. Owinoโs work in the kitchen, he attests that he \n2  โworked in the kitchen on and off throughout each period of detention at OMDC.โ  ECF \n3  No. 84-3 ยถ 5.  His โnormal shift in the kitchen was from 3:00 a.m. โ 12:00 p.m., five days \n4  per week,โ id. ยถ 6, and that his โusual schedule would be to work from 3:00 a.m. until about \n5  6:30 a.m.โ and from 7:00 a.m. to โ12:00 p.m. without any other scheduled rest break.โ  Id. \n6  ยถ 7.  Although there was typically a meal โbreakโ between 6:30 a.m. and 7:00 a.m., the \n7  kitchen crew had to use at least some of that time to prepare their own meals.  Id.  Further, \n8  โthere were many instances where [Mr. Owino] and other kitchen workers would work \n9  more than [their] shift[,] . . . including up to 14 working hours in a day.โ  Id. ยถ 6.  Mr. Owino \n10  was paid $1.00 per day, id. ยถ 10, regardless of the length of his shift or any extra hours \n11  worked.  See id. ยถ 11.  His pay was also capped at $5.00 per week, meaning that when he \n12  worked  a  sixth  and/or  seventh  day  each  week,  he  would  not  receive  any  additional \n13  payment.  See id. ยถ 22.  Accordingly, Mr. Owino has proven that, as a member of the \n14  kitchen crew, he may not have been paid overtime, provided with mandatory rest periods, \n15  and provided with proper meal periods. \n16  But the declarations fail to provide sufficient detail as to Mr. Owinoโs work as a \n17  chemical porter and cleaner or as to Mr. Gomezโs work as a cleaner for the Court to \n18  conclude that they are members of the California Labor Class as to the overtime and rest \n19  and meal break claims as to those positions.  Mr. Owino and Mr. Gomez both attest that \n20  there was โno set shiftโ for these positions and that they were expected to โwork โuntil the \n21  job was done[,]โโ without any โscheduled rest or meal breaks.โ  ECF No. 84-3 ยถยถ 8โ9; ECF \n22  No. 84-4 ยถ 7.  From the limited evidence in the record, it appears that the โtypicalโ schedule \n23  for these positions was between two and six hours per shift, see ECF No. 118-5 at 479 \n24 \n                                                                 \n25 \n8 There also may exist typicality issues where, as here, the representative plaintiffs seek to represent a \n26  class comprised of individuals holding positions that differ from their own.  See, e.g., Kelley v. SBC, Inc., \nNo. 97-CV-2729 CW, 1998 WL 1794379, at *15 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 18, 1998) (โ[T]he typicality requirement \n27 \nis not met for a class that would include both employees in Plaintiffsโ positions, in which there is \nsubstantial diversity, and other positions that named Plaintiffs do not hold.  The Court thus finds that \n28 \nPlaintiffs meet the typicality requirement only as to a class comprised of the positions that they held.โ). \n29 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8292   Page 30 of 59\n \n1  ยถยถ 40โ42;9 however, a rest period is only mandated for shifts lasting at least three-and-a-\n2  half hours, IWC Order No. 5-2001, Section 12(A), while a meal break is only required for \n3  shifts lasting at least five hours.  See Cal. Labor Code ยง 512(a).  Plaintiffs therefore have \n4  failed to establish that they were entitled to overtime or meal or rest periods for work \n5  performed as chemical porters or cleaners.   \n6        ii.  Statute of Limitations \n7  Second, Defendant contends that both Mr. Owino and Mr. Gomez may be time-\n8  barred from pursuing claims under the California Labor Code and IWC Orders.  See ECF \n9  No. 118 at 23โ24.  Plaintiffs counter that โpossible differences in the application of a statute \n10  of limitations to individual class members, including the named plaintiff, does not preclude \n11  certification of a class action so long as the necessary commonality and, in the 23(b)(3) \n12  class action, predominance, are otherwise present.โ  ECF No. 127 at 13 (quoting Dibb v. \n13  Allianceone Receivables Mgmt., Inc., No. 14-5835 RJB, 2015 WL 8970778, at *8 (W.D. \n14  Wash.

May 22, 2013 (Dkt. 118-7 at 155, \n23 \nCCOG0000246[3]).โ  See ECF No. 164 at 2.  If this is true, Mr. Owino will not be a member of the \nCalifornia Labor Law Class, the Class Period for which begins May 31, 2013.  See supra page 31.  \n24 \nAlthough the Court permitted Plaintiffs to file a response to Defendantโs supplemental brief, thereby \n25  mitigating any due process concerns, the Court is disinclined to resolve this issue at the class certification \nstage given Defendantโs belated assertion of this defense and factual disputes concerning whether \n26  Mr. Owino worked during the Class Period for the California Labor Law Class, see ECF No. 169 at 1,  \n3โ4; compare ECF No. 84-3 ยถ 5 (โDuring each period of detention at OMDC, I performed work through \n27 \nthe โVolunteer Work Program.โโ), with ECF No. 118-7 at 774 (claiming to show that Mr. Owinoโs last \ndate of payment through the VWP was May 22, 2013), particularly given that Mr. Gomez remains a viable \n28 \nclass representative for the majority of the claims of the California Labor Law Class.   \n32 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8295   Page 33 of 59\n \n1  v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 402โ03 (1975)); see also Troester, 2019 WL 2902487, at *2 \n2  (โ[W]hether [the named plaintiff] can represent . . . class members [who may pursue \n3  penalties  under  Section  226]  is  a  typicality  issue  for class certification.โ);  Burton  v. \n4  Mountain W.

Mont. 2003) (โ[The \n5  proposed class representativeโs] claim is time-barred and she cannot serve as a class \n6  representative.โ).   \n7  Accordingly, the Court concludes that neither Mr. Owino nor Mr. Gomez is typical \n8  of the members of the California Labor Law Class seeking penalties under Section 226 and \n9  that Mr. Gomez is not typical of members of the California Labor Law Class seeking \n10  waiting time penalties under Section 203 or penalties or actual damages under Section 226. \n11        iii.  Non-California Facilities \n12  Finally, as to the National Forced Labor Class, Defendant urges that because both \n13  Mr. Owino and Mr. Gomez were detained at California facilities, โthey cannot say that they \n14  suffered the same or similar injury as putative class members at these facilitiesโ and โthey \n15  also have no incentive to pursue a class action on behalf of detainees in facilities they never \n16  stepped foot in.โ  ECF No. 118 at 24.  Defendant also contends that Plaintiffs have failed \n17  to meet their burden to establish uniform policies as to sanitation and discipline because \n18  Plaintiffs have introduced evidence concerning the policies of only ten of Defendantโs \n19  twenty-four nationwide facilities and the declarations of only four detainees, all of whom \n20  are from Defendantโs California facilities.  Id. at 26.   \n21  Plaintiffs rejoin that they โand the putative class members all worked as a direct \n22  result of . . . threatsโ of discipline and that โPlaintiffs can adequately represent the interests \n23  of a national class because they were subjected to CoreCivicโs enterprise-wide policies and \n24  practices and their claims are typical of the class.โ  ECF No. 127 at 14 (citing Evans v. \n25  IAC/Interactive Corp., 244 F.R.D. 568, 573, 576 (C.D.

Further, โCoreCivic \n26  fails to address, and effectively concedes, that (1) its facilities use template policies and \n27  procedures that are create by CoreCivicโs Facility Support Center, which functions as \n28  CoreCivicโs โcorporate office,โ and (2) the use of the template policies and procedures are \n33 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8296   Page 34 of 59\n \n1  mandatory such that facilities do not have the ability to โopt outโ of them.โ  ECF No. 127 \n2  at 10โ11 (citing Ridley Decl.

Ex. 6 at 59:8โ12).  โCoreCivic[] . . . also overlooks Mr. Ellisโ testimony that the \n4  VWP, sanitation, and discipline policies on which Plaintiffs rely are โstandard policiesโ that \n5  are applicable across CoreCivicโs facilities.โ  Id. at 11 (citing Ridley Decl. Ex. 3 at  \n6  75:9โ25, 77:13โ17). \n7  The  Court  concludes  that  Plaintiffs  adequately  have  established  standardized \n8  policies  concerning  the  cleaning  of  common  areas  under  threat  of  discipline  across \n9  Defendantโs non-California facilities.  The policies from ten of Defendantโs twenty-four \n10  facilities, see ECF No. 118 at 3; see also Ridley Decl. Exs. 9, 12โ29, coupled with the \n11  testimony from Defendantโs Rule 30(b)(6) witness that Defendant uses template policies \n12  throughout its facilities from which the facilities cannot opt out, see Ridley Decl. Ex. 3 at \n13  49:21โ51:147  54:24โ55:13,  59:1โ5,  68:1โ9,  75:9โ25,  77:13โ17,  compel  the  Court  to \n14  conclude that Plaintiffs have met their burden at the class certification stage as to the \n15  standardization of Defendantโs policies across its facilities.  See Alba, 2007 WL 953849, \n16  at *2 (noting that contention that policy was applied differently in California โgoes to the \n17  merits  of  the  disputeโ).    Consequently,  for  purposes  of  class  certification,  the  Court \n18  concludes that Plaintiffs have established that their claims under the TVPA are typical of \n19  those of the putative members of the National Forced Labor Class given the uniformity of \n20  policies across Defendantโs facilities for the cleaning of common areas and discipline for \n21  failure to comply.

R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4). \n17  C.  Rule 23(b)(3) Requirements \n18  Rule 23(b)(3) states that a class may be maintained if the requirements of Rule 23(a) \n19  are fulfilled and if โthe court finds that the questions of law or fact common to the class \n20  members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a \n21  class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the \n22  controversy.โ  Fed.

Uniformity of Defendantโs Policies \n9  As an initial matter, Defendant contends that, โto certify a claim based on a policy \n10  or practice, a plaintiff must present โsignificant proofโ that a policy or practice in fact exists \n11  and that the entire class was subjected to it.โ  ECF No. 118 at 25 (citing Wal-Mart, 564 \n12  U.S. at 353; Ellis, 657 F.3d at 983) (emphasis in original).  Defendant challenges Plaintiffsโ \n13  proof regarding the uniformity of its sanitation and disciplinary policies and overtime and \n14  break policies.  See id. at 25โ29. \n15  i.  California Labor Law Class: Overtime and Rest and Meal \nBreak Policies \n16 \n \n17  Defendant argues that Plaintiffs have failed to โprovide any evidence to support any \n18  . . . policiesโ that Defendant does โnot pay[] overtime wages and refus[es] to provide rest \n19  and meal breaks, in violation of Californiaโs labor laws.โ  ECF No. 118 at 28.  In fact, \n20  Defendant argues, its policy explicitly โprohibit[s] detainees from working more than eight \n21  hours in a day or forty hours in a week.โ  Id. (emphasis in original). \n22  Plaintiffs counter that โthe common policies and practices alleged by Plaintiffs are \n23  either confirmed by CoreCivic in its Opposition Brief or established by CoreCivicโs own \n24  written policies and Mr. Ellisโ testimony.โ  ECF No. 127 at 10.  โAt best, CoreCivic has \n25  created a dispute of material fact concerning the existence of the policies and practices that \n26  are the subject of Plaintiffsโ class claims[, b]ut merely denying the existence of a policy or \n27  practice in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary is not sufficient to defeat \n28  class certification.โ  Id.

Plaintiffs have introduced several of \n11  Defendantโs policies, handbooks, and a VWP Agreement Form.  See Ridley Decl. Exs. 9, \n12  11, 12, 14, 19, 21, 24, 27.  The VWP is among the โstandard policiesโ created by template \n13  by Defendantโs own Facility Support Centerโs policies and procedures department from \n14  which Defendantโs facilities cannot โopt out.โ  See Ridley Decl. Ex. 3 at 49:21โ51:147 \n15  54:24โ55:13, 59:1โ5, 68:1โ9, 75:9โ25, 77:13โ17.  Not only do these policies not provide \n16  for payment of overtime, see generally Ridley Decl. Exs. 9, 12, 14, 19, 21, 24, 27, but it is \n17  clear that no overtime wagesโif earnedโwere ever paid because โ[c]ompensation [was] \n18  $1.00 per day.โ  Ridley Decl. Ex. 9.  Accordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have \n19  established a uniform policy as to the payment of overtime wages.11  See Alba v. Papa \n20  Johnโs USA, Inc., No. CV 05-7487 GAF (CTX), 2007 WL 953849, at *1 (C.D. Cal.

See infra Section II.C.1.b. \n37 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8300   Page 38 of 59\n \n1  Rest and Meal Breaks:  The Court concludes, however, that Plaintiffs have failed to \n2  establish a uniform policy as to the provision of meal and rest breaks.  To establish the \n3  existence of uniform policies, Plaintiffs cite to their own declarations and the deposition \n4  testimony of Jason Ellis and Fred Figueroa, two of Defendantโs employees.  See ECF No. \n5  87 at 7 (citing ECF No. 84-3 ยถยถ 7โ9; ECF No. 84-4 ยถ 7; Ridley Decl. Ex. 3 (ECF No.  \n6  85-4) at 129:23โ130:15; Ridley Decl. Ex. 6 (ECF No. 85-7) at 34:2โ8).  Mr. Owino, for \n7  example, attests that, as a member of the kitchen crew, he received only one, thirty-minute \n8  meal โbreak,โ during which he was required to prepare his own meal, and no rest breaks \n9  while working a 3:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. shift.  ECF No. 84-3 ยถ 7.  As a chemical porter \n10  and cleaner, he would work shifts of an unspecified length with โno scheduled rest or meal \n11  breaks.โ  ECF No. 84-4 ยถยถ 8โ9.  Similarly, Mr. Gomez worked as a cleaner for shifts of an \n12  unspecified length without โscheduled rest or meal breaks.โ  ECF No. 84-4 ยถ 7.  Mr. Ellis \n13  testified both that he was โnot sure if there are -- there are breaks or notโ and that he was \n14  โsure there would be breaks, some breaks at leastโ but that he โd[id]nโt know the length of \n15  those breaks or -- or the duration.โ  Ridley Decl. Ex. 3 at 129:23โ130:15.  Mr. Figueroa \n16  testified that the โoutside crewโ works between 7:30 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. with โa lunch break \n17  in the middleโ and โno regularly scheduled break.โ  Ridley Decl. Ex. 6 at 34:2โ8.     \n18  On this record, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have failed to establish a uniform \n19  policy as to the denial of rest and meal breaks.  In the absence of a written policy, โPlaintiffs \n20  must show โsubstantial evidenceโ of a systematic policyโ depriving detainees of rest and \n21  meal breaks.  See Nevarez v. Costco Wholesale Corp., No. 2:19-CV-03454-SVW-SK, 2019 \n22  WL 7421960, at *7 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 26, 2019) (citing In re AutoZone, 289 F.R.D. at 539; \n23  Brinker Rest. Corp. v. Super. Ct., 53 Cal. 4th 1004, 1051 (2012)).  As discussed above, see \n24  supra Section II.B.3.a.1, Plaintiffs have failed to meet this burden.  Indeed, Plaintiffs have \n25  introduced no evidence that detainees in the VWP holding positions other than the morning \n26  kitchen shift were deprived of a legally mandated rest or meal break.   See id.  As for that \n27  one shift, Plaintiffs have introduced the sworn testimony of only one detainee, Mr. Owino, \n28  to support an allegedly systemic policy of depriving those detainees of legally mandated \n38 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8301   Page 39 of 59\n \n1  breaks.  ECF No. 84-3 ยถ 7.  The Court cannot conclude that Mr. Owinoโs testimony as to \n2  his โnormal shift,โ see id. ยถ 6, amounts to โsubstantial evidence,โ particularly given the \n3  testimony of D. Topasna, Chief of Unit Management at the San Diego Correctional Facility \n4  (โSDCFโ) and OMDC, see Def.โs Ex. at 472 ยถ 3, that Defendantโs practice was that the \n5  breakfast shift went from 3 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. with โa meal break and . . . multiple rest \n6  periods.โ12  Id. at 479 ยถ 39.  The Court therefore concludes that, based on the current record, \n7  Plaintiffs have failed to establish that Defendant has a uniform policy or practice of denying \n8  detainees legally mandated rest and meal breaks. \n9  ii.  Forced Labor Classes: Sanitation and Discipline Policies \n10  Defendant also contends that Plaintiffs have failed to introduce significant proof that \n11  the putative class members were subjected to uniform sanitation and disciplinary policies \n12  that forced detainees to clean common areas under threat of discipline.  See ECF No. 118 \n13  at 25โ26.  Specifically, the written policies themselves require only that the detainees clean \n14  their assigned living areas, whereas detainees in the VWP program are required to clean \n15  the common areas, see id. at 25, and detainees are not disciplined with segregation for \n16  failing to clean.  See id. at 25โ26.  Further, the only evidence that detainees are forced to \n17  clean common areas under threat of disciplinary segregation comes from the declarations \n18  of four detainees, which โis not โsignificant proofโ that more than 120,000 detainees were \n19  subject to their claimed policy.โ  See id. at 26. \n20  Plaintiffs dispute Defendantโs reading of the sanitation policy, contending that there \n21  is insufficient evidence that the cleaning policies of which Plaintiffs complain apply only \n22  to those participating in the VWP.  See ECF No. 127 at 3โ4.  Further, Defendantโs own \n23  witness confirmed that โany of the types of discipline is possible,โ see id. at 4 (citing Ridley \n24  Decl. Ex. 3 at 157:5โ16), and this threat of discipline was conveyed to all detainees at \n25  intake through the admission handbook and reinforced through Defendantโs enforcement \n26 \n                                                                 \n27 \n12 Although not evidence, this is consistent with Defendantโs counselโs representation at the hearing that \nwhether  breaks  were  provided  was  determined  by  the  individual  supervising  officer.    See  Tr.  at  \n28 \n31:6โ33:17. \n39 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8302   Page 40 of 59\n \n1  of the policy, as attested to by half-a-dozen detainees.  See id. at 5 (citing Pl.โs Exs. 27โ29; \n2  Ortiz  Decl.  ยถ  4;  Nunez  Decl.  ยถ  4;  Owino  Decl.  ยถยถ  23โ24;  Gomez  Decl.  ยถยถ  19โ20; \n3  Santibanez Decl. ยถยถ 3โ4; Jones Decl. ยถยถ 3โ8). \n4  The Court concludes that Plaintiffs sufficiently have demonstrated for purposes of \n5  class certification that Defendant implemented common sanitation and discipline policies \n6  that together may have coerced detainees to clean areas of Defendantโs facilities beyond \n7  the  personal  housekeeping  tasks  enumerated  in  the  ICE  PBNDS.    First,  Defendantโs \n8  sanitation policies provide that โ[a]ll detainees/inmates assigned to a unit are responsible \n9  for  maintaining  the  common  living  area  in  a  clean  and  sanitary  mannerโ  and  that \n10  โ[d]etainee/inmate workers will be assigned to each area on a permanent basis to perform \n11  the daily cleaning routine of the common area,โ including trash removal, sweeping and \n12  mopping, cleaning and scrubbing of bathroom facilities, and wiping off of furniture.  \n13  Ridley Decl.

Exs. 14 (ECF No. 87-9) and 19 (ECF No. 87-14) at 1โ2 (SDCF in California); \n16  Ridley Decl. Ex. 15 (ECF No. 87-10) at 1โ2 (North Georgia Detention Center); Ridley \n17  Decl.

Don Hutto Residential Center in Texas); Ridley Decl. \n19  Ex. 20 (ECF No. 87-15) at 1โ2 (La Palma Correctional Center in Arizona).  Although \n20  Defendant is adamant that these policies โdo[] not require detainees to clean the common \n21  areas of the housing units,โ see, e.g., ECF No. 118 at 4 (emphasis in original), this is not \n22  clear from the face of the policies.  For example, as for the โCOMMON LIVING AREAS,โ \n23  the policies note not only that โ[a]ll detainees/inmates assigned to a unit are responsible for \n24  maintaining the common living area in a clean and sanitary manner,โ but also that โ[t]he \n25  officer assigned to that unit will see that all materials needed to carry out this cleaning \n26  assignment are provided.โ  See, e.g., Ridley Decl. Ex. 12 at 1.  Further, the policies outline \n27  a โCLEANING PROGRAM FOR OTHER AREAS,โ indicating that โ[a]ll floors will be \n28  swept and mopped on a daily basis,โ โ[t]oilet bowls and sinks will be cleaned daily,โ โ[t]he \n40 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8303   Page 41 of 59\n \n1  showers and floors will be mopped and scrubbed daily,โ โ[a]ll furniture will be dusted on \n2  a daily basis and cleaned when necessary,โ โ[a]ll trash will be emptied daily,โ โ[w]indows \n3  will be washed weekly or more often when erquired,โ โ[w]alls and doors will be wiped \n4  daily,โ and โ[a]ll equipment will be dusted or cleaned on a daily basis.โ  Id. at 1โ2.  There \n5  is no indication from the face of the policies that these tasks are to be performed only by \n6  those participating in the VWP, and there exists a dispute of fact based on the declarations \n7  submitted by staff of Defendant, who testified that the sanitation policies did not require \n8  detainees to clean up after others, see ECF No. 123 ยถยถ 6โ21; ECF No. 118-2 at 68โ70  \n9  ยถยถ 5โ20, 130โ33 ยถยถ 9โ25, 136โ38 ยถยถ 6โ20; ECF No. 118-5 at 466โ69 ยถยถ 6โ22, 473โ6  \n10  ยถยถ 6โ23, and those submitted by several detainees, who testified that they were requiredโ\n11  separate and apart from the VWPโto clean common areas, including windows, floors, \n12  toilets, sinks, showers, and furniture, without payment and under threat of punishment.  See \n13  ECF No. 84-3 ยถยถ 17โ24; ECF No. 84-4 ยถยถ 13โ20; ECF No. 84-5 ยถยถ 3โ4, 6; ECF No. 84-6 \n14  ยถยถ 3โ4, 5.13  As Plaintiffs note, the Court cannot resolve factual disputes of this nature at \n15  this stage in the litigation.  See ECF No. 127 at 11 (citing Howell v. Advantage RN, LLC, \n16  No. 17-CV-0883 JLS (BLM), 2018 WL 3437123, at *2 (S.D. Cal. July 17, 2018)). \n17  Second, Defendantโs policies and the declarations of putative class members support \n18  Plaintiffsโ  contention  that  Defendant  may  have  procured  this  labor  under  threat  of \n19  punishment.  For example, the Detainee Admission and Orientation Handbook for OMDC \n20  indicates that โ[i]t is expected that staff will receive your full cooperation while you are \n21  in this facility,โ Ridley Decl. Ex. 21 (ECF No. 85-22) at 8 (emphasis in original); detainees \n22  are to โ[o]bey all orders as given by staff members,โ id.; and detainees are to โADHERE \n23  TO ALL OTHER RULES AS INSTRUCTED BY ANY STAFF MEMBER.โ  Id. at 39 \n24  (emphasis  in  original).    As  for  disciplinary  action,  the  OMDC  handbook  notes  that \n25  โ[r]efusal to clean assigned living areaโ or โ[r]efus[al] to obey a staff member/officerโs \n26 \n                                                                 \n27 \n13 There are two paragraphs numbered โ5โ in the Declaration of Jonathan Ortiz Dubon.  The Court cites \n28 \nto the second paragraph 5. \n41 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8304   Page 42 of 59\n \n1  orderโ  may  be  sanctioned  with,  among  other  things,  โ[d]isciplinary  transfer \n2  (recommended),โ โ[d]isciplinary [s]egregation (up to 72 hours),โ โ[l]oss of privileges (e.g., \n3  commissary,  vending  machines,  movies,  recreation,  etc.),โ  โ[c]hange  housing,โ  or \n4  โ[r]estrict to housing pod.โ  Id. at 45.  The same recommended disciplinary actions can be \n5  found  in  handbooks  from  other  of  Defendantโs  facilities,  both  within  and  outside  of \n6  California.  See Ridley Decl. Ex. 22 (ECF No. 85-23) at 29 (Florence Correctional Center \n7  in Arizona); Ridley Decl. Ex. 23 (ECF No. 85-24) at 29 (SDCF in California); Ridley Decl. \n8  Ex. 24 (ECF No. 85-25) at 49 (Laredo Processing Center in Texas); Ridley Decl. Ex. 25 \n9  (ECF No. 85-26) at 17 (Eloy Detention Center in Arizona); Ridley Decl. Ex. 26 (ECF No. \n10  85-27) at 17 (Houston Processing Center in Texas).  At this stage, this suffices to show that \n11  Defendant had a uniform disciplinary policy that could reasonably be understood to have \n12  subjected detainees to discipline for failure to comply with the uniform sanitation policy.  \n13  This conclusion is bolstered by the declarations of Plaintiffs and other putative class \n14  members, who attest that failure to abide by an order to clean the commons areas could \n15  result in disciplinary action consistent with the uniform disciplinary policy or even other \n16  retaliatory measures.  See, e.g., ECF No. 84-3 ยถยถ 19, 23โ24; ECF No. 84-4 ยถยถ 15, 19โ20; \n17  ECF No. 84-5 ยถยถ 3โ4; ECF No. 84-6 ยถยถ 3โ4. \n18  The Court therefore concludes that, for purposes of class certification, Plaintiffs \n19  sufficiently have established that Defendant instituted uniform sanitation and disciplinary \n20  policies that were applied class-wide and, taken together, may have coerced detainees \n21  under threat of discipline into performing cleaning duties beyond those permitted by ICE. \n22      b.  The California Labor Law Class \n23  Plaintiffs urge that the claims of the California Labor Law Class โall turn on a \n24  common  legal  question:  whether  ICE  detainees  that  worked  through  the  VWP  at \n25  CoreCivicโs facilities in California are employees of CoreCivic under California law and \n26  entitled to the protections for employees set forth in the California Labor Code and the \n27  IWCโs Wage Order No. 5-2001.โ  ECF No. 87 at 17.  Although Defendant โdoes not dispute \n28  that [whether detainees who participate in the VWP are CoreCivicโs employees under \n42 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8305   Page 43 of 59\n \n1  California law] is a common question,โ it does contest whether it is โa โsignificant aspect \n2  of the case.โโ  ECF No. 118 at 32 (quoting Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1022).  Defendant asserts \n3  that โ[t]here are many other individual questions needed to fully resolve the putative class \n4  member[sโ] claims,โ including detaineesโ status as authorized or unauthorized aliens, hours \n5  worked, whether detainees received meal and/or rest periods, the amount of damages, and \n6  the amount of any offset.  See id. at 32โ33.   \n7  Plaintiffs claim that Defendant โmisses the mark entirelyโ because โPlaintiffs and \n8  the putative class members were subjected to the same generally applicable policies and \n9  practices while involuntarily confined at CoreCivic as ICE detainees,โ meaning โ[t]heir \n10  claims depend on whether the challenged policies and practices are unlawful and will \n11  โprevail or fail in unisonโ based on the Courtโs adjudication of that issue.โ  ECF No. 127 at \n12  12 (citing Amgen Inc. v. Conn. Ret. Plans & Tr. Funds, 568 U.S. 455, 460 (2013)).   \n13  Plaintiffs  are  correct  that  โ[c]ertification is  appropriate  where  the  legality  of  a \n14  particular policy presents a โsignificant question of lawโ that is โapt to drive the resolution \n15  of the litigation.โโ  Boyd v. Bank of Am. Corp., 300 F.R.D. 431, 437 (C.D. Cal. 2014) \n16  (quoting Abdullah v. U.S. Sec. Assoc., 731 F.3d 952, 963 (9th Cir. 2013) (citing Wal-\n17  Mart, 564 U.S. at 350)); see also Moore v. Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc., 311 \n18  F.R.D. 590, 604โ05 (C.D. Cal. 2015) (โThe factual issue of whether [the defendantโs] \n19  policies actually requireโor are interpreted to requireโ[the alleged labor law violation] \n20  is  one  that  is common to  the class as  a  whole,  and  it  is  capable  of  resolution \n21  by common proof.โ); Alba, 2007 WL 953849, at *14 (โWhether the [defendantโs] policy \n22  satisfies the right to meal and rest periods under California law is a question of law . . . \n23  common to the proposed subclass.โ).  Nevertheless, the Court must โtake into consideration \n24  all factors that militate in favor of, or against, class certification.โ  Vinole v. Countrywide \n25  Home Loans, Inc., 571 F.3d 935, 946 (9th Cir. 2009) (citing In re Wells Fargo Home \n26  Mortg.

Cal. 2017) (quoting Erica P. John Fund, 563 U.S. \n2  at 809).  โ[T]he Court identifies the substantive issues related to plaintiffโs claims . . . then \n3  considers  the  proof  necessary  to  establish  each element of  the claim or  defense;  and \n4  considers how these issues would be tried.โ  Id. (quoting Gaudin v. Saxon Mortg. Servs., \n5  Inc., 297 F.R.D. 417, 426 (N.D. Cal. 2013)).  โThe predominance inquiry requires that \n6  plaintiff demonstrate that common questions predominate as to each cause of action for \n7  which plaintiff seeks class certification.โ  Gaudin, 297 F.R.D. at 426 (citing Amchem \n8  Prods., 521 U.S. at 620).  Further, โ[a] court evaluating predominance โmust determine \n9  whether  the  elements  necessary  to  establish  liability,โโ  here,  employee  status,  โโare \n10  susceptible to common proof or, if not, whether there are ways to manage effectively proof \n11  of any element that may require individualized evidence.โโ  Villalpando v. Exel Direct Inc., \n12  303 F.R.D. 588, 608 (N.D. Cal. 2014) (quoting Ayala v. Antelope Valley Newspapers, \n13  Inc., 59 Cal. 4th 522, 533 (2014)). \n14  Here, Plaintiffs urge that their โclaims for violations of the California Labor Code \n15  and violations of the IWCโs Wage Order No. 5-2001 all hinge on the common legal issue \n16  of whether CoreCivicโs classification of ICE detainees that worked through the VWP as \n17  โvolunteersโ was correct or whether the ICE detainees were employees of CoreCivic under \n18  California law.โ  See ECF No. 87 at 18.  Strictly speaking, this does not suffice to meet \n19  Plaintiffsโ  burden.    See,  e.g.,  Abikar  v.  Bristol  Bay  Native  Corp.,  No.  317CV01036 \n20  GPCAGS,  2018  WL  6593747,  at  *7  (S.D.  Cal.  Dec.  14,  2018)  (concluding  that  the \n21  plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of establishing predominance under Rule 23(b)(3) \n22  where their โpredominance assertion ma[de] no reference to their underlying claimsโ); \n23  accord Celena King v. Great Am. Chicken Corp., No. CV 17-4510-GW(ASX), 2019 WL \n24  6348463, at *3 (C.D. Cal.

Nonetheless, โpublic policy \n26  favor[s] disposition of cases on their merits,โ Hernandez v. City of El Monte, 138 F.3d 393, \n27  399 (9th Cir. 1998); consequently, the Court analyzes each of Plaintiffโs claims. \n28  / / / \n44 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8307   Page 45 of 59\n \n1        i.  Minimum Wage \n2  Plaintiffsโ fourth cause of action is for failure to pay minimum wage in violation of \n3  California Labor Code sections 1194, 1197, and 1197.1 and IWC Wage Order No. 5-2001.  \n4  See FAC ยถยถ 71โ75.  Whether asserted under the California Labor Code or the UCL, see \n5  supra Section II.B.3.a.ii, the Court concludes that common issues predominate as to the \n6  minimum wage claim. \n7  Here,  there  are  common,  predominating  questions  concerning  Defendantโs \n8  classification  of  detainees  participating in  the  VWP  as  volunteers  and,  consequently, \n9  whether those detainees were paid according to Californiaโs minimum wage statutes and \n10  regulations.  Previously, the Court expressed concern regarding whether this claim was \n11  susceptible to common proof, see, e.g., Tr. at 6:17โ20; however, upon further reflection \n12  and review of the record, the Court concludes that โ[m]ethods of common proof could be \n13  devisedโ to determine whether detainees participating in the VWP were paid a minimum \n14  wage.  See Kamar v. Radio Shack Corp., 254 F.R.D. 387, 402 (C.D. Cal. 2008), affโd, 375 \n15  F. Appโx 734 (9th Cir. 2010).  Although Defendant does not maintain detailed time-\n16  keeping  records  for  its  detainees,  cf.  Novoa  v.  GEO  Group,  Inc.,  No.  EDCV172514 \n17  JGBSHKX, 2019 WL 7195331, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 26, 2019), there still exist records \n18  for days on which detainees worked, see, e.g., Ridley Decl. Exs. 45โ50, andโeven if the \n19  records currently before the Court are not completeโthere appear to be set schedules for \n20  the various positions held by participants in the VWP.  See, e.g., Def.โs Exs. at 479โ80 \n21  ยถยถ 39โ42.    Together,  this  evidence  may  allow  the  trier  of  fact  to  determine  which \n22  participants in the VWP were paid less than the minimum wageโand by how muchโ\n23  based on the difference between the payment received and the number of hours per shift \n24  for the position, thereby โavoid[ing] testimony by every class member.โ  See Kamar, 254 \n25  F.R.D. at 402.  The Court therefore concludes that there exist common, predominating \n26  questions for the California Labor Law Class as to Plaintiffsโ minimum wage cause of \n27  action. \n28  / / / \n45 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8308   Page 46 of 59\n \n1        ii.  Overtime \n2  Plaintiffโs fifth cause of action is for failure to pay overtime wages in violation of \n3  California Labor Code sections 204, 510, and 1194 and IWC Wage Order No. 5-2001.  See \n4  FAC  ยถยถ 76โ79.    The  Court  concludes  that  Plaintiffs  have  not  met  their  burden  of \n5  establishing that common issues predominate as to this claim.   \n6  Not only have Plaintiffs failed to establish that there exists a common policy that \n7  detainees were required to work overtime, see supra Section II.B.3.a.i, but it is not clear to \n8  the Court that Plaintiffsโ claim is susceptible to common proof.  Should the Court determine \n9  that the members of the California Labor Law Class were employees rather than detainees, \n10  there must be some means of determining on a class-wide basis which detainees are entitled \n11  to overtimes wages, which is a question of liability and not damages.  In the absence of a \n12  written policy or schedule mandating overtime or substantial evidence that the shifts \n13  actually worked by detainees entitled them to overtime, Plaintiffs have failed to establish \n14  that the overtime claim is susceptible to common proof.14  See, e.g., Washington v. Joeโs \n15  Crab Shack, 271 F.R.D. 629, 642 (N.D. Cal. 2010) (โPlaintiff has provided no evidence of \n16  any  company-wide  or  class-wide  policy  of  requiring  โoff-the-clockโ  work,  and  the \n17  individualized assessment necessary to ascertain whether there were in fact any employees \n18  who were told to work โoff-the-clockโ would not be susceptible to common proof.โ).   \n19  This issue is exacerbated by the breadth of the defined California Labor Class as \n20  โ[a]ll ICE detainees . . . detained at a CoreCivic facility located in California . . . [who] \n21  worked through CoreCivicโs voluntary work program.โ  See ECF No. 87 at 14.  Essentially, \n22  Plaintiffs seek to certify a class comprised of an untold number of unenumerated positions, \n23  including cleaners, laundry workers, kitchen crews, clerical workers, barbers, librarians, \n24  and  landscapers.    See  FAC  ยถ 14.    โBecause  it  is  highly  unlikely  that  all  positions \n25 \n                                                                 \n26 \n14 To be clear, the Court does not conclude that Plaintiffs cannot establish that their overtime claims are \n27 \nsusceptible to common proof.  For example, the overtime claims may be susceptible to common proof if \nPlaintiffs  can  adduce  additional  evidence  as  to  a  written  or  unspoken  policy  applying  throughout \n28 \nCalifornia requiring VWP participants to work overtime. \n46 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8309   Page 47 of 59\n \n1  and job duties at Defendant[โs facilitie]s are identical, and that all Class Members would \n2  be seeking the same relief, the Court is not persuaded[, at least on the current record,] that \n3  there are no dissimilarities in the proposed class that could โimpede the generation of \n4  common answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.โโ  See Lusby v. Gamestop \n5  Inc.,  297  F.R.D.  400,  410โ11  (N.D.  Cal.  2013)  (quoting  Wal-Mart, 564  U.S.  at  350 \n6  (quoting Richard A. Nagareda, Class Certification in the Age of Aggregate Proof, 84 \n7  N.Y.U. L. Rev. 97, 132 (2009))) (citing Nielson v. Sports Authority, No. C 11-4724 SBA, \n8  2012 WL 5941614, at *3 (N.D. Cal.

Nov. 18, 1998)).   \n11  For all these reasons, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have failed to establish that \n12  common issues predominate as to the California Labor Law Class for the overtime claims. \n13        iii.  Meal Breaks \n14  Plaintiffโs sixth cause of action is for failure to provide mandated meal breaks in \n15  violation of California Labor Code sections 226.7 and 512 and IWC Wage Order No.  \n16  5-2001.  FAC ยถยถ 80โ83.  Again, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have not met their \n17  burden of establishing that common issues predominate as to this claim. \n18  As with the overtime claims, see supra Section II.C.1.b.ii, Plaintiffs have failed to \n19  introduce evidence of a common policy that detainees in the VWP were denied meal \n20  breaks, see supra  Section II.B.3.a.i, or that the meal break claims are susceptible to \n21  common proof.  Should the Court determine that the members of the California Labor Law \n22  Class were employees rather than detainees, there must be some means of determining on \n23  a class-wide basis which detainees were entitled to a meal break and which detainees did \n24  not receive the mandated meal break.  Again, these are questions going to liability and not \n25  only to damages.  Because Plaintiffs have failed to introduce evidence concerning the \n26  entitlement to meal breaks for the various positions held through the VWP or a common \n27  policy or systematic practice concerning the deprivation of such breaks, they have failed \n28  to establish that common issues predominate as to meal break claims of the California \n47 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8310   Page 48 of 59\n \n1  Labor Law Class.

Accordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have failed to \n11  establish that common issues predominate as to the California Labor Law Class for the \n12  meal break claims.15 \n13        iv.  Rest Breaks \n14  Plaintiffโs seventh cause of action is for failure to provide mandated rest breaks in \n15  violation of California Labor Code section 226.7 and IWC Wage Order No. 5-2001.  FAC \n16  ยถยถ 84โ86.  For the same reasons the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have failed to establish \n17  that Plaintiffs have not met their burden of establishing that common issues predominate \n18  as to the meal break claims, see supra Section II.C.1.b.iii, the Court also concludes that \n19  Plaintiffs have failed to establish that common issues predominate as to the California \n20  Labor Law Class for the rest break claims. \n21        v.  Wage Statements \n22  Plaintiffsโ eighth cause of action is for failure to provide timely and accurate wage \n23  statements in violation of California Labor Code section 226.  FAC ยถยถ 87โ93.  Defendant \n24  does not oppose certification of the California Labor Law Class as to this claim, see \n25  generally ECF No. 118; see also ECF No. 127 at 1, arguing only that it is time-barred \n26 \n                                                                 \n27 \n15 Again, the Court reiterates that it does not conclude that Plaintiffs cannot establish that their meal break \nclaims are susceptible to common proof, see supra note 15, although the weight of authority tends to \n28 \nindicate that it may be more difficult for Plaintiffs to meet their burden as to these claims. \n48 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8311   Page 49 of 59\n \n1  because Plaintiffs seek only penalties.  See, e.g., ECF No. 118 at 17.  The Court concludes \n2  that  whether  Defendant  provided  wage  statements  to  the  participants  in  the  VWP  is \n3  susceptible to common proof.  Accordingly, to the extent the wage statement claims are \n4  not time-barred,16 the Court concludes that there exist common, predominating questions \n5  for the California Labor Law Class as to Plaintiffsโ claims concerning Defendantโs failure \n6  to provide wage statements. \n7        vi.  Payment of Compensation Upon Termination \n8  Plaintiffsโ  ninth  cause  of  action  is  for  failure  to  pay  compensation  upon \n9  termination/waiting time penalties pursuant to California Labor Code sections 201 through \n10  203.  FAC ยถยถ 94โ96.  Defendant does not appear to contend that common issues do not \n11  predominate, see generally ECF No. 118 at 32โ33; rather, Defendant appears to contest \n12  only the timeliness of this claim.  See id. at 17; see also supra Section II.B.3.a.ii.  The Court \n13  concludes that whether Defendant paid compensation to the participants in the VWP upon \n14  termination is susceptible to common proof.  Accordingly, the Court concludes that there \n15  exist common, predominating questions for the California Labor Law Class as to Plaintiffsโ \n16  claims concerning Defendantโs failure to pay compensation upon termination. \n17        vii.  Unlawful Conditions of Employment \n18  Plaintiffsโ tenth cause of action is for imposition of unlawful terms or conditions of \n19  employment pursuant to California Labor Code section 432.5.  FAC ยถยถ 97โ101.  As with \n20  the  wage  statement  claims,  see  supra  Section  II.C.1.b.v,  Defendant  does  not  oppose \n21  certification of the California Labor Law Class as to this claim, see generally ECF No. 118; \n22  see also ECF No. 127 at 1, although it does contend that the only applicable underlying \n23  claim is for failure to pay minimum wages.17  See, e.g., Tr. at 38:18โ39:2.  The Court \n24 \n                                                                 \n25 \n16 Defendant contends that the wage statement claims are time-barred because Plaintiffs appear to seek \n26  only penalties.  See, e.g., Tr. at 37:21โ38:2 (citing FAC ยถ 92).  Whether Plaintiffs seek solely penalties or \nother remedies for their wage statement claims is beyond the scope of the Certification Motion. \n27 \n \n17 Plaintiffs allege that the agreement โinclude[d] numerous terms that are prohibited by law, including \n28 \nbut not limited to agreeing to work for less than minimum wage or without appropriate overtime \n49 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8312   Page 50 of 59\n \n1  concludes that whether Defendant has imposed unlawful conditions of employment upon \n2  the participants in the VWP for the alleged violations of the California Labor Code that are \n3  susceptible to common proof is itself susceptible to common proof.  Accordingly, the Court \n4  concludes that there exist common, predominating questions for the California Labor Law \n5  Class as to Plaintiffsโ claims concerning Defendantโs imposition of unlawful conditions of \n6  employment. \n7        viii.  Conclusion \n8  The Court therefore concludes, pursuant to any limitations discussed above, that \n9  Plaintiffs have established that common questions predominate as to the California Labor \n10  Law Classโs causes of action for failure to pay minimum wage, failure to provide wage \n11  statements, failure to pay compensation upon termination, and imposition of unlawful \n12  conditions of employment based on those violations, as well as any viable derivative causes \n13  of action.  See infra Section II.C.1.e. \n14      c.  The National Forced Labor Class \n15  Plaintiffs argue that the claims of the National Forced Labor Class hinge upon \n16  whether โCoreCivicโs policy and practice of forcing ICE detainees to clean areas of the \n17  facility above and beyond personal housekeeping tasks enumerated in the ICE PBNDS \n18  under treat of discipline, including solitary confinement, . . . constitute[s] a violation of the \n19  Federal TVPAโs prohibition on obtaining labor or services by means of force or serious \n20  harm[;] threats of force or serious harm[;] or by means of any scheme, plan, or pattern \n21  intended to cause a person to believe that serious harm would result if that person did not \n22  perform such labor or services.โ  ECF No. 87 at 21.  Defendant responds that โa common \n23  question cannot simply be whether all putative class members have โsuffered a violation of \n24  the same provision of law,โโ ECF No. 118 at 29 (citing Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350), and \n25  that โresolving whether each putative class member was in fact a victim of a TVPA . . . \n26 \n                                                                 \n27 \ncompensation.โ  FAC ยถ 99.  Whether the other claims the Court has certified as part of the California \nLabor Law Class, namely, the wage statement claims and failure to pay compensation upon termination \n28 \nclaims, were among the terms in the written agreement is beyond the purview of this Order. \n50 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8313   Page 51 of 59\n \n1  violation requires the resolution of many individualized inquiries that are particular to each \n2  class member,โ essentially, โwhy did you work?,โ a question that โwill require delving into \n3  each class memberโs subjective state of mind.โ  Id. at 29โ30.  Plaintiffs reply that their \n4  โclaims under the CA and Federal TVPA do not turn on โindividualized inquiries[,]โโ \n5  because โ[w]here liability depends on a threat of disciplinary action, the statutes both call \n6  for the application of an objective standard to determine whether a โreasonable personโโ\n7  in this case, ICE detainees involuntarily confined in a prison-like facilityโwould perform \n8  the  work  mandated  by  CoreCivic.โ    ECF  No.  127  at  12  (citing  Cal.  Penal  Code \n9  ยง 236.1(h)(4); 18 U.S.C. ยง 1589(c)(2)). \n10  The Court allowed both sides to present additional briefing on Novoa, 2019 WL \n11  7195331, in which the district court certified classes similar to the proposed California and \n12  National Forced Labor Classes here.  See id. at *10, *16 & n.11, *20; see also ECF Nos. \n13  153, 160, 164.  In its supplemental brief, Defendant urges the Court to conclude that Novoa \n14  is distinguishable based on the fact that โthere is no undisputed written policy in this caseโ \n15  and that โNovoa adopted Menocal[ v. GEO Group, Inc., 320 F.R.D. 258 (D. Colo. 2017)]โs \n16  predominance analysis, which is  . . . inapplicable hereโ because the Plaintiffs here โdo not \n17  even allege that they were aware of the written policies or worked because of them.โ  See \n18  ECF No. 164 at 4โ5.  Further, Menocal was โbased on unique Tenth Circuit jurisprudence \n19  permitting classwide causation evidence . . . , which the Ninth Circuit has not adopted,โ id. \n20  at 5 n.4 (citing CGC Holding Co. v. Broad & Cassel, 773 F.3d 1076 (10th Cir. 2014); \n21  Poulos v. Caesars World, Inc., 379 F.3d 668 (9th Cir. 2004)), and โ[w]hether the labor was \n22  obtained โby means ofโ or โaccomplished throughโ the threat is still an individualized, \n23  subjective inquiry.โ  Id. at 5 n.5 (citing David v. Signal Intโl, LLC, No. 08-1220, 2012 WL \n24  10759668, at *20โ22 (E.D. La. Jan. 4, 2012)). \n25  Finally, on March 19, 2020, Defendant requested that the Court consider the recent \n26  decision in Barrientos v. CoreCivic, Inc., No. 18-15081, 2020 WL 964358 (11th Cir. Feb. \n27  28, 2020), in which the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the district courtโs denial of Defendantโs \n28  motion to dismiss a TVPA claim asserted by ICE detainees in Georgia and โh[e]ld that the \n51 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8314   Page 52 of 59\n \n1  TVPA applies to private for-profit contractors operating federal immigration detention \n2  facilities.โ    Id.  at  *9;  see  also  ECF  No.  172.18    Defendants  contend  that  Barrientos \n3  โsupports Defendantโs argument that the putative National Forced Labor Class cannot be \n4  certified because each class member must individually establish that their allegation of \n5  forced labor rises to the level of an actionable claim under the [TVPA], a determination \n6  that cannot be made for all class members in one stroke.โ  ECF No. 172 at 1.  Not \n7  surprisingly, Plaintiffs respond that โBarrientos supports the Courtโs tentative decision to \n8  certify Plaintiffsโ Forced Labor [C]lassesโ and that Defendant โmisrepresents the holding \n9  of Barrientos[,] . . . which was expressly โlimited to the legal question of the TVPAโs \n10  applicability to private contractors operating federal immigration detention facilities[.]โโ  \n11  ECF No. 173 at 1 (quoting Barrientos, 2020 WL 964358, at *1). \n12  Having carefully reviewed the Partiesโ arguments and the additional authorities \n13  submitted by each side, the Court ultimately agrees with Plaintiffs.  First, the Court \n14  concludes that Barrientos offers little guidance here.  Not only is Barrientos not binding \n15  on this Court, but Plaintiffs are correct that โthe discrete legal issue before [the Eleventh \n16  Circuit]โ has no bearing on the Partiesโ arguments for and against class certification.  See \n17  2020 WL 964358 at *6; see also ECF No. 173 at 1.  Defendantโs attempt to divine from \n18  Barrientos  whether  the  Eleventh  Circuit  would  conclude  that  individual  questions \n19  predominate such that class certification of a TVPA would be improper is nothing more \n20  than unsubstantiated tea-leaf reading and is therefore of minimal relevance here. \n21  Second, the Court rejects Defendantโs contention that โ[w]hether the labor was \n22  obtained โby means ofโ or โaccomplished throughโ the threat is still an individualized, \n23  subjective inquiry.โ  See ECF No. 164 at 5 n.5 (citing David, 2012 WL 10759668, at  \n24  *20โ22).  As an initial matter, the court in David concluded that โindividual issues with \n25 \n                                                                 \n26 \n18 To the extent Defendant requests the opportunity to further brief Barrientos, see ECF No. 172 at 3, the \n27 \nCourt only granted additional briefing on Novoa at the request of Defendant, see Tr. at 57:21โ22, whereas \nPlaintiffs have indicated their belief that additional briefing on Barrientos is not required.  See ECF No. \n28 \n173 at 1โ2.  The Court therefore DENIES Defendantโs request to further brief Barrientos. \n52 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8315   Page 53 of 59\n \n1  respect to coercion and consent will predominate Plaintiffsโ ยง 1589 forced labor claims.โ  \n2  See 2012 WL 10759668, at *22.  The Court is not convinced that this analysis applies \n3  within the Ninth Circuit, where a TVPA claim requires the plaintiff to establish that the \n4  employer intended to cause the victim to believe that he or she would suffer serious harm \n5  by means of an objectively, sufficiently serious threat of harm.  See United States v. Dann, \n6  652 F.3d 1160, 1170 (9th Cir. 2011); accord Tanedo v. E. Baton Rouge Par. Sch. Bd., No. \n7  LA CV10-01172 JAK, 2011 WL 7095434, at *8 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 12, 2011); see also Novoa, \n8  2019 WL 7195331, at *16 n.11. \n9  Even if coercion and/or consent were a relevant determination such that there exists \n10  a subjective inquiry, however, the court in David acknowledged that a TVPA claim may \n11  be suitable for class certification under certain circumstances resembling those here.  See \n12  2012 WL 10759668, at *21.  Indeed, the court in David concluded that certification was \n13  not appropriate on the facts of that case, which โinvolve[d] paid workers who in fact could \n14  leave their jobs at any time, . . . were for the most part paid well, free to come and go as \n15  they pleased, and some [of whom] even took vacations and bought cars.โ  Id.   Further, \n16  โthe โthreatsโ that Plaintiffs allege were made to compel them to work were often made to \n17  individuals, not to the class as a whole,โ meaning that โ[t]he pressure to work for [the \n18  defendant] arguably came at least in part from a set of circumstances that each plaintiff \n19  individually brought upon himself.โ  Id.  Here, by contrast, the putative class members \n20  were not paid more than a dollar or two a day and were not free to come and go as they \n21  pleased.  See, e.g., FAC ยถ 10.  Further, Plaintiffs allege that the threats were communicated \n22  to the class as a whole through Defendantโs uniform disciplinary policy.  Id. ยถ 42(c).  \n23  Consequently, David does not support Defendantโs contention. \n24  On  the  other  hand,  two  district  courts  applying  Ninth  Circuit  precedent  have \n25  concluded that individual issues do not predominate where โthe class members share a \n26  large number of common attributesโ . . . allowing the fact-finder to use a common \n27  โreasonable personโ standard for all class members.โ  See Tanedo, 2011 WL 7095434, at \n28  *8; see also Novoa, 2019 WL 7195331, at *16 (adopting analysis of Menocal); Menocal, \n53 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8316   Page 54 of 59\n \n1  320 F.R.D. at 267 (โThe circumstances hereโnamely the class membersโ detainment, the \n2  imposition of a uniform policy, and the numerous other questions common to the classโ\n3  certainly make it beneficial to permit such an inference [of causation on a class-wide \n4  basis].โ).  As in Tanedo and Novoa, the putative class members share a large number of \n5  common attributes, including that they are immigrants who are or were involuntarily \n6  detained in Defendantโs facilities and subjected to common sanitation and disciplinary \n7  policies.   \n8  Third and finally, the Court disagrees with Defendant that the Ninth Circuit does not \n9  permit โclasswide causation evidence,โ such that Novoa and Menocal are inapplicable.  See \n10  ECF No. 164 at 5 n.4 (citing CGC Holding, 773 F.3d 1076; Poulos, 379 F.3d at 668).  The \n11  cases  on  which  Defendant  relies,  CGC  Holding  and  Poulos,  were  both  Racketeer \n12  Influences and Corrupt Organizations cases.  See CGC Holding, 773 F.3d at 1089โ93; \n13  Poulos, 379 F.3d at 664.  To the extent those cases have any bearing in the TVPA context, \n14  see Menocal, 320 F.R.D. at 267 n.5 (acknowledging that CGC Holding did โnot dictate the \n15  outcome in this matterโ), the Ninth Circuitโs โnarrow and case-specificโ decision in Poulos \n16  was based on its determination that โgambling is not a context in which [the court] can \n17  assume that potential class members are always similarly situated.โ  379 F.3d at 665โ66.  \n18  In other contexts, such as consumer protection putative class actions, for example, the \n19  Ninth Circuit has recognized that reliance or causation can be inferred on a class-wide basis \n20  where the putative class members are similarly situated; in Walker v. Life Insurance \n21  Company of the Southwest, No. 19-55241, 2020 WL 1329665 (9th Cir. Mar. 23, 2020), for \n22  example, the Ninth Circuit reiterated that in the context of UCL actions โthe operative \n23  question  has  become  whether  the  defendant  so  pervasively  disseminated  material \n24  misrepresentations that all plaintiffs must have been exposed to them.โ  Id. at *5 (citing \n25  Stearns v. Ticketmaster Corp., 655 F.3d 1013, 1020โ21 (9th Cir. 2011), abrogated on other \n26  grounds by Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, 569 U.S. 27 (2013)).  The sum total of these \n27  authorities is that an inference of class-wide causation may be permissible where, as here,  \n28  / / / \n54 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8317   Page 55 of 59\n \n1  the putative class members share a large number of common attributes such that they are \n2  similarly situated.  As discussed above, the Court concludes that this is such a case. \n3  As in Tanedo, โ[c]ommon questions of fact include . . . whether Defendant[] utilized \n4  threats of serious . . . harm to compel Plaintiffs to workโ and โ[c]ommon questions of law \n5  include . . . whether Defendantsโ conduct violated the TVPA,โ answers to which โare \n6  โcapable of classwide resolution[]โ and โwill determine . . . if the Plaintiffs were threatened \n7  with serious . . . harm, an issue central to the TVPA claims.โ  See 2011 WL 7095434, at *6 \n8  (quoting  Wal-Mart,  564  U.S.  at  350).    Accordingly,  the  Court  concludes  that  the \n9  commonality and predominance requirements are satisfied as to the National Forced Labor \n10  Class.  \n11  d.  The California Forced Labor Class \n12  Plaintiffs assert that the claims of the California Forced Labor Class โall depend on \n13  resolution of . . . [w]hether CoreCivicโs policy and practice requiring ICE detainees in its \n14  California  facilities  to  clean  areas  of  the  facility  above  and  beyond  the  personal \n15  housekeeping tasks enumerated in the ICE PBNDS under threat of discipline constitutes \n16  โhuman traffickingโ within the meaning of California Penal Code ยง 236.1(a).โ  ECF No. 87 \n17  at 19.  As with the National Forced Labor Class, Defendant contends that there are not \n18  common questions of law and fact governing the California Forced Labor Class because \n19  โthe California facilities do not have a policy or practice of forcing detainees to clean \n20  common areas under threat of disciplinary segregationโ and โ[t]he allegations of four \n21  detainees is not โsignificant proofโ that โseveral thousandsโ . . . of detainees in California \n22  facilities were subject to their claimed policy.โ  ECF No. 118 at 27.  โFurthermore, \n23  resolving whether each putative class member was in fact a victim of a . . . California TVPA \n24  violation requires the resolution of many individualized inquiries that are particular to each \n25  class member.โ  Id. at 29. \n26    For the same reasons the Court determines that Plaintiffs have established there are \n27  common questions of law and fact that predominate as to the National Forced Labor Class,  \n28  / / / \n55 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8318   Page 56 of 59\n \n1  see supra Section III.C.1.c, the Court also determines that Plaintiffs have met their burden \n2  as to commonality and predominance for the California Forced Labor Class.   \n3        e.  Derivative Claims \n4  Plaintiffsโ third cause of action is for violation of the UCL, FAC ยถยถ 63โ70; eleventh \n5  cause of action is for negligence, id. ยถยถ 102โ19; and twelfth cause of action is for unjust \n6  enrichment.  Id. ยถยถ 120โ28.  Plaintiffs acknowledge that each of these causes of action are \n7  derivative of the claims for violations of California labor law, see, e.g., ECF No. 87 at 18, \n8  and California and federal TVPA.  See, e.g., id. at 20.  Consequently, to the extent these \n9  claims are causes of action not barred by the statute of limitations,19 the Court concludes \n10  that common questions predominate to the same  extent discussed above.   See supra \n11  Sections II.C.1.b.iโvii, II.C.1.cโd. \n12    2.  Superiority \n13  The final requirement for class certification is โthat a class action [be] superior to \n14  other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.โ  Fed R. \n15  Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  โIn determining superiority, courts must consider the four factors of Rule \n16  23(b)(3).โ  Zinser, 253 F.3d at 1190.  The Rule 23(b)(3) factors are: \n17 \n(A) [T]he class membersโ interests in individually controlling the \n18  prosecution or defense of separate actions; (B) the extent and \nnature of any litigation concerning the controversy already begun \n19 \nby or against class members; (C) the desirability or undesirability \n20  of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular \nforum; and (D) the likely difficulties in managing a class action. \n21 \n \n22  / / / \n23 \n24                                                                   \n25  19 For example, Defendant contends that Plaintiffโs negligence cause of action is time-barred.  See, e.g., \nECF No. 118 at 17.  Further, โ[i]n California, there is not a standalone cause of action for โunjust \n26  enrichment,โ . . . [although] a court may โconstrue the cause of action as a quasi-contract claim seeking \nrestitution.โโ  Astiana v.

App. 4th 1350 (2010); Jogani v. Super. Ct., 165 Cal. App. 4th 901 (2008)).  The Court declines to \n28 \nresolve these issues at this time and on the current record. \n56 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8319   Page 57 of 59\n \n1  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  The superiority inquiry focuses โon the efficiency and economy \n2  elements of the class action so that cases allowed under [Rule 23(b)(3)] are those that can \n3  be adjudicated most profitably on a representative basis.โ  Zinser, 253 F.3d at 1190 \n4  (internal quotation marks omitted).  A district court has โbroad discretionโ in determining \n5  whether class treatment is superior.  Kamm v. Cal. City Dev. Co., 509 F.2d 205, 210 (9th \n6  Cir. 1975). \n7  Plaintiffs contend that a class action is superior here because โmany of the putative \n8  class members have a limited understanding of the law, limited English skills, and limited \n9  resources to devote to pursuing recovery.โ  ECF No. 87 at 25.  โMany former ICE detainees \n10  also  fear  retaliation  given  their  uncertain  immigration  status  or  ongoing  immigration \n11  proceedings.โ  Id. (citing Just Film, Inc. v. Buono, 847 F.3d 1108, 1123 (9th Cir. 2017)).  \n12  โFinally, the class members are geographically dispersed given the number of CoreCivic \n13  facilities throughout the United States.โ  Id. (citing In re Monster Worldwide, Inc. Secs. \n14  Litig., 251 F.R.D. 132, 139 (S.D.N.Y. 2008)). \n15  Defendant claims that โPlaintiffs fail to meaningfully address, much less meet their \n16  burden of establishing through evidence, that class treatment is the โsuperiorโ method for \n17  resolving all claims efficiently and economically.โ  ECF No. 118 at 33.  Specifically, \n18  Defendant contends, โ[t]he putative National classes have no meaningful ties to California, \n19  and Plaintiffs provide no reason why this forum is superior.โ  Id. (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. \n20  23(b)(3)(C)).  Defendant claims that this action is not manageable as a class action because \n21  it involves โfive classes, which . . . will include more than 120,000 people who are scattered \n22  across a multitude of countries.โ  Id. at 34.  According to Defendant, individualized \n23  inquiries as to liability and damages also weigh against class certification here.  See id. at \n24  34โ35. \n25  Plaintiffs note that โdamages calculations cannot defeat class certification,โ ECF No. \n26  127 (quoting ECF No. 118 at 35), and note that โCoreCivicโs arguments regarding other \n27  pending  litigation  against  CoreCivicโin  addition  to  demonstrating  the  scope  of \n28  CoreCivicโs enterprise-wide policies and practicesโconfirms that the class members are \n57 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8320   Page 58 of 59\n \n1  geographically dispersed.โ  Id. (citing In re Monster Worldwide, Inc. Secs. Litig., 251 \n2  F.R.D. at 139).  Further, this is the first-filed of the several class actions to which Defendant \n3  cites โand is the farthest along.โ  Id. \n4  Although Defendant is correct that this action could prove unwieldy, it is also \n5  precisely the sort of action where class-wide litigation is superior to other methods of \n6  litigation.  See Tr. at 28:23โ29:13 (โ[I]f this doesnโt happen on a class basis, it doesnโt \n7  happen. . . .  These detainees are not in a position to take any action. . . .  [A class action] \n8  may be the only way to consider doing this.โ).  Here, โthe โrisks, small recovery, and \n9  relatively high costs of litigationโ make it unlikely that plaintiffs would individually pursue \n10  their claims,โ โconsiderations . . . [that] vividly point[] to the need for class treatment.โ  See \n11  Just Film, Inc., 847 F.3d at 1123; see also Amchem Prods., 521 U.S. at 617 (โThe policy \n12  at the very core of the class action mechanism is to overcome the problem that small \n13  recoveries do not provide the incentive for any individual to bring a solo action prosecuting \n14  his or her rights.โ) (quoting Mace v. Van Ru Credit Corp., 109 F.3d 338, 344 (7th Cir. \n15  1997)).  Further, โlitigation on a classwide basis would promote greater efficiency in \n16  resolving the classesโ claims.โ  Id. at 1123โ24 (citing Valentino v. Carter-Wallace, Inc., 97 \n17  F.3d 1227, 1234 (9th Cir. 1996)).  Because no viable alternative method for adjudication \n18  exists, the Court concludes that class-wide litigation is superior.  See, e.g., Leyva v. Medline \n19  Indus. Inc., 716 F.3d 510, 515 (9th Cir. 2013) (concluding that district court erred in \n20  concluding that class action was not superior where โit appears that no[ other means for \n21  putative  class  members  to  adjudicate  their  claims]  exist[s]โ);  see  also  Bennett  v. \n22  GoDaddy.com LLC, No. CV-16-03908-PHX-ROS, 2019 WL 1552911, at *13 (D. Ariz. \n23  Apr. 8, 2019) (โRealistically, the only alternative is for Defendant to avoid effectively all \n24  liability for its actions. . . .  A class action is far superior to the alternative of most of the \n25  allegedly harmed individuals obtaining no relief.โ) (citing Carnegie v. Household Intโl, \n26  Inc., 376 F.3d 656, 661 (7th Cir. 2004)). \n27  / / / \n28  / / / \n58 \n17-CV-1112 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-01112-JLS-NLS   Document 179   Filed 04/01/20   PageID.8321   Page 59 of 59\n \n1  CONCLUSION \n2  In light of the foregoing, the Court DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE Plaintiffsโ \n3  Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (ECF No. 97), DENIES Defendantโs Motion for \n4  Judgment on the Pleadings (ECF No. 117), DENIES AS MOOT Plaintiffโs Motion to \n5  Exclude (ECF No. 128), and GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART Plaintiffsโ \n6  Motion for Class Certification (ECF No. 84).

This action arises from systematic and unlawful wage theft, unjust enrichment, and \n14 \nforced labor at Californiaโs Otay Mesa Detention Center (the โOtay Mesa Facilityโ or the โFacilityโ).  \n15 \n2.  The Otay Mesa Facility is a civil immigration detention facility owned and operated \n16 \nfor profit by Defendant CoreCivic, Inc. (โCoreCivicโ).  \n17 \n18  3.  CoreCivic  is  a  multibillion-dollar  corporation  that  owns  and  operates  detention \n19  facilities across the United States. CoreCivic has made hundreds of millions of dollars in profits from \n20 \nits contract to run the Otay Mesa Facility.  \n21 \n4.  Although it is contractually required to provide for all essential detention services at \n22 \nthe Facility, CoreCivic uses the free and nearly-free labor of detainees to perform these services to \n23 \nmaximize profits. \n24 \n5.  CoreCivic pays detainees $1 or $1.50 per day โ or nothing at all โ to maintain and \n25 \noperate the Facility.      \n26 \n27 \n28 \n  2   \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-AJB-NLS   Document 1   Filed 12/27/17   PageID.3   Page 3 of 25\n \n1  6.  This labor is not voluntary in any meaningful sense. CoreCivic maintains a corporate \n2 \npolicy and uniform practice at the Otay Mesa Facility of withholding necessary protection, care, and \n3 \nservices from its detainees to ensure a ready supply of available labor needed to operate the Facility.  \n4 \n7.  As a result, detainees are forced to submit to CoreCivicโs unlawful detainee labor \n5 \nscheme to buy the basic necessities โ including food, water, warm clothing, medicine, and hygiene \n6 \nproducts โ that CoreCivic unlawfully refuses to provide for them.   \n7 \n8.  CoreCivic maintains a corporate policy and uniform practice at the Otay Mesa Facility \n8 \n9  of threatening detainees who refuse to work with solitary confinement, cutting off communication \n10  and visitation with family, reporting their actions to the United States Immigration and Customs \n11 \nEnforcement  (โICEโ),  or  referring  them  for  criminal  prosecution.  Together  with  CoreCivicโs \n12 \nsystemic under-provision for detainee needs, these abusive practices and threats of abuse ensure that \n13 \ndetainees will continue working for subminimum wages, or for nothing at all.  \n14 \n9.  CoreCivicโs  scheme  significantly  reduces  its  labor  costs  and  expenses,  and \n15 \nexponentially  increases  its  already  vast  profits,  by  unlawfully  forcing  and  coercing  detainees  to \n16 \nperform labor at subminimum wages or for free.  These policies and practices violate California \n17 \n18  minimum wage law, the California Unfair Competition Law, and federal and state Trafficking Victims \n19  Protection Acts, which prohibit forced labor.  \n20 \n10.   Plaintiffs Carlos Gonzalez, Juan Jose Merino-Rodas, Maribel Gutierrez-Canchola, \n21 \nGladys Carrera-Duarte, and Jennye Pagoada-Lopez, individually and on behalf of all others similarly \n22 \nsituated, brings this class action lawsuit to stop the economic exploitation of detainees at the Otay \n23 \nMesa  Facility,  to  recover  unpaid  wages,  and  to  remedy  the  unjust  enrichment  resulting  from \n24 \nCoreCivicโs unlawful failure to pay its detainee workforce legal wages.           \n25 \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n26 \n27  11.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331 because this \n28  action arises under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, 18 U.S.C. ยงยง 1589 et seq. \n  3   \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-AJB-NLS   Document 1   Filed 12/27/17   PageID.4   Page 4 of 25\n \n1  12.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the Class Action Fairness Act \n2 \nof 2005, 28 U.S.C. ยง 1332(d), because at least one class member is of diverse citizenship from one \n3 \ndefendant; there are more than 100 class members; the aggregate amount in controversy exceeds \n4 \n$5,000,000; and minimal diversity exists. \n5 \n13.  Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b)(2) because the events or \n6 \nomissions giving rise to the claims occurred in this District. \n7 \n14.  This Court has personal jurisdiction over CoreCivic because the corporation regularly \n8 \n9  conducts business in California, and has sufficient minimum contacts with California.    \n10  15.  Plaintiffs  request  that  this  Court  exercise  supplemental  jurisdiction  pursuant  to \n11 \n28 U.S.C. ยง 1367 over their state law claims arising under the California Minimum Wage Act, the \n12 \nCalifornia Unfair Competition Law, and California common law.  \n13 \nPARTIES \n14 \nA.  Plaintiffs \n15 \n16.  Plaintiff Carlos Gonzalez is an adult resident of Bakersfield, California. He is a citizen \n16 \n17  of El Salvador and is seeking asylum in the United States. From May 2017 through November 2017, \n18  he was detained at the Otay Mesa Facility. During those months, Mr. Gonzalez was employed by \n19 \nCoreCivic as a kitchen worker, janitor, and administrative clerk. He was paid only $1 or $1.50 per day \n20 \nfor his labor โ or nothing at all โ regardless of how many hours he worked.   \n21 \n17.  Plaintiff Juan Jose Merino-Rodas is an adult resident of Bakersfield, California. He is \n22 \na citizen of El Salvador and is seeking asylum in the United States. From May 2017 through \n23 \nNovember 2017, he was detained at the Otay Mesa Facility. During those months, Mr. Merino Rodas \n24 \nwas employed by CoreCivic as a kitchen worker and janitor. He was paid only $1 or $1.50 per day for \n25 \n26  his labor โ or nothing at all โ regardless of how many hours he worked.   \n27 \n28 \n  4   \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-AJB-NLS   Document 1   Filed 12/27/17   PageID.5   Page 5 of 25\n \n1  18.  Plaintiff Maribel Gutierrez-Canchola is a current detainee at the Otay Mesa Facility. \n2 \nShe is a citizen of Mexico and is seeking asylum in the United States. She has been detained at the \n3 \nFacility  since  on  or  around  June  17,  2017.  Ms.  Gutierrez-Canchola  is  currently  employed  by \n4 \nCoreCivic as a janitor. She is paid only $1.50 per day for her labor โ or nothing at all โ regardless of \n5 \nhow many hours she works.   \n6 \n19.  Plaintiff Gladys Carrera-Duarte is a current detainee at the Otay Mesa Facility. She is \n7 \na citizen of Guatemala and is seeking asylum in the United States. She has been detained at the \n8 \n9  Facility since on or around June 30, 2017. Ms. Carrera-Duarte is currently employed by CoreCivic as \n10  a janitor. She is paid only $1.50 per day for her labor โ or nothing at all โ regardless of how many \n11 \nhours she works.   \n12 \n20.  Plaintiff Jennye Pagoada-Lopez is a current detainee at the Otay Mesa Facility. She is \n13 \na citizen of Honduras and is seeking asylum in the United States. Ms. Pagoada-Lopez has been \n14 \ndetained at the Facility since on or around July 23, 2017. She is employed by CoreCivic as a janitor. \n15 \nShe is paid only $1.50 per day for her labor โ or nothing at all โ regardless of how many hours she \n16 \nworked.     \n17 \n18  B.  Defendant \n19  21.  Defendant CoreCivic, formerly the Corrections Corporation of America, is a for-\n20 \nprofit  corporation  providing  correctional  and  detention  services.  CoreCivic  is  a  Maryland \n21 \ncorporation, with its principal office located at 10 Burton Hills Boulevard, Nashville, Tennessee, \n22 \n37215. \n23 \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n24 \nA.  Immigration detention is civilโnot criminal.  \n25 \n22.  Each  year,  hundreds  of  thousands  of  individuals  are  detained  in  geographically \n26 \n27  isolated  immigration  detention  facilities  while  awaiting  immigration  or  citizenship  status \n28 \n  5   \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-AJB-NLS   Document 1   Filed 12/27/17   PageID.6   Page 6 of 25\n \n1  determinations.  These  detainees  include  U.S.  citizens,  lawful  permanent  residents  (green  card \n2 \nholders) with longstanding family and community ties, survivors of torture, asylum seekers, victims \n3 \nof human trafficking, children, and pregnant women.  \n4 \n23.  Some  detainees  were  brought  to  the  United  States  as  children.  And  thousands \n5 \nultimately have their United States citizenship or legal residency affirmed by an immigration court or \n6 \nfederal judge. \n7 \n24.  Immigration  violations  are  civil  violations,  and  immigration  detention  is  civil  in \n8 \n9  nature.1 Many detainees have no criminal history at all.   \n10  25.  Notwithstanding  immigration  detentionโs  civil  nature  and  purpose,  detainees  are \n11 \nsubjected to prison-like conditions at the Otay Mesa Facility. According to Dora Schriro, former \n12 \nhead of ICEโs Office of Detention Policy and Planning, most detainees are held โ systematically and \n13 \nunnecessarily  โ  under  circumstances  inappropriate  for  immigration  detentionโs  noncriminal \n14 \npurposes.2    Detainees  are  frequently  subjected  to  punitive  and  long-term  solitary  confinement, \n15 \ninadequate  medical  care,  sexual  and  physical  assault,  lack  of  access  to  counsel,  and  other \n16 \nharsh conditions of confinement, all without a conviction. \n17 \n18  26.  Many detainees accede to deportation simply to obtain release from these intolerable \n19  conditions, even when they have valid claims to remain in the United States, including claims for \n20 \nasylum or other discretionary relief.      \n21 \nB.  The privatization of immigration detention and CoreCivicโs economic windfall. \n22 \n27.  Immigration detention expanded roughly eightfold over the past two decades, from a \n23 \ncapacity of 5,532 detention beds in 19943 to a current capacity of over 41,000.4  \n24 \n25 \n                                                 \n1 See Fong Yue Ting v. United States, 149 U.S. 698, 728โ30 (1893) (observing that deportation proceedings have โall the \n26 \nelements of a civil caseโ and are โin no proper sense a trial or sentence for a crime or offenseโ). \n2 Dora Schriro, U.S. Depโt of Homeland Sec., โImmigration Detention Overview and Recommendations,โ at 10, 15 \n27 \n(2009). \n3 Sharita Gruberg, โHow For-Profit Companies are Driving Immigration Detention Policies, Center for American \n28 \nProgressโ (Dec. 18, 2015), available at \n  6   \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-AJB-NLS   Document 1   Filed 12/27/17   PageID.7   Page 7 of 25\n \n1  28.  During the same period, CoreCivic and other private prison corporations have spent \n2 \ntens of millions of dollars on lobbying efforts.5   \n3 \n29.  As  immigration  detention  has  expanded,  private  prison  corporations,  particularly \n4 \nCoreCivic, have gained an increasing share of the contracts for new detention beds.6  \n5 \n30.  Contracts with ICE accounted for 28% of CoreCivicโs total revenues in 2016 ($511.8 \n6 \nmillion), up from up from 24% in 2015.7 CoreCivic officials expect these lucrative ICE contracts to \n7 \naccount for a significant percentage of the corporationโs ongoing revenues.8   \n8 \n9  31.  CoreCivicโs 2016 revenues were approximately $1.85 billion, and its stock is publicly \n10  traded on the New York Stock Exchange.9    \n11 \n32.  CoreCivicโs economic windfall, and the profitability of its immigration detention \n12 \nenterprise, arise from its policy of systemically withholding necessary case from detainees to ensure a \n13 \nreadily available, captive labor force that cleans, maintains, and operates its facilities for sub-minimal \n14 \nwages under threat of solitary confinement and abuse of legal process. Without this nearly free \n15 \ndetainee labor, CoreCivicโs windfall from immigrant detention would be substantially decreased. \n16 \nC.  CoreCivic withholds necessary care from detainees at the Otay Mesa Facility.  \n17 \n18  33.  Since 2005, CoreCivic has contracted with ICE to operate the Otay Mesa Facility, \n19  which is a 1,482-bed immigration detention facility in San Diego, California.    \n20 \n34.  The Otay Mesa Facility is notorious for its poor treatment of detainees.   \n21 \n                                                                                                                                                            \n22  https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/reports/2015/12/18/127769/how-for-profit-companies-are-\ndriving-immigration-detention-policies/.  \n23  4 Jenny Jarvie, โThis industry stands to benefit from Trumpโs crackdown on the border,โ Los Angeles Times (Feb. 14, \n2017) available at http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-immigrant-detention-20170214-story.html. \n24  5 Michael Cohen, โHow for-profit prisons have become the biggest lobby no one is talking about,โ Washington Post \n(Apr. 28, 2015), available at https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/04/28/how-for-profit-prisons-\n25  have-become-the-biggest-lobby-no-one-is-talking-about/?utm_term=.25de04ae71f9  \n6 Bethany Carson & Eleana Diaz, โPayoff: How Congress Ensures Private Prison Profit with an Immigrant Detention \nQuota, Grassroots Leadership,โ (Apr. 2015) at 4, Chart 1-AA, available at \n26 \nhttps://grassrootsleadership.org/sites/default/files/reports/quota_report_final_digital.pdf  \n7 CoreCivic.

CoreCivic maintains a corporate policy and uniform practice of withholding sufficient \n2 \nprotection, food, water, medicine, clothing, and hygiene products from the detainees at the Otay \n3 \nMesa Facility. As a result, detainees are forced to either purchase these daily necessities from the \n4 \nFacilityโs commissary, or go without.  \n5 \n36.  By maintaining these harsh conditions and purposely withholding basic necessities \n6 \nfrom detainees, CoreCivic ensures an available labor pool of detainees will work for only $1 or $1.50 \n7 \nper day, thus allowing it to continue operating the Otay Mesa Facility at an enormous profit.  \n8 \n9  D.  CoreCivic uses detainees to clean, maintain, and operate the Otay Mesa Facility. \n10  37.  Through its so-called Voluntary Work Program (the โWork Programโ), CoreCivic \n11 \nhires detainees to perform work that directly contributes to institutional operations, at a rate of $1 or \n12 \n$1.50 per day. \n13 \n38.  Despite its name, the Work Program is not โvoluntaryโ in any meaningful sense. \n14 \nInstead, as noted above, CoreCivic maintains a corporate policy and uniform practice at the Otay \n15 \nMesa Facility of withholding necessary care and protection from detainees. As a result, detainees are \n16 \nforced to submit to CoreCivicโs detainee labor scheme in order to buy necessities โ including food, \n17 \n18  water, medicine, clothing, and hygiene products โ that CoreCivic refuses to provide for them.   \n19  39.  Further, CoreCivic maintains a corporate policy and uniform practice at the Facility \n20 \nof threatening to place those who refuse to work into solitary confinement. These conditions, \n21 \npolicies, and practices ensure that detainees continue working for subminimum wages.       \n22 \n40.  In the Work Program, detainees are required to work according to an assigned work \n23 \nschedule and to participate in work-related training. At all times, CoreCivic controls detaineesโ wages, \n24 \nhours, and working conditions.   \n25 \n41.  CoreCivic provides all necessary personal protection equipment and work uniforms.    \n26 \n27  42.  CoreCivic records the hours detainees work and periodically credits wages to their \n28  accounts.         \n  8   \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-AJB-NLS   Document 1   Filed 12/27/17   PageID.9   Page 9 of 25\n \n1  43.  The  detainee  workers  are  โemployees,โ  and  CoreCivic  is  an  โemployerโ  under \n2 \nCaliforniaโs minimum wage laws. \n3 \n44.  CoreCivic informs all detainees entering the Otay Mesa Facility that the following \n4 \nwork assignments may be available through the Work Program:  \n5 \na.  Intake \n6 \nb.  Kitchen Worker \n7 \nc.  Recreation \n8 \n9  d.  Library \n10  e.  Barber \n11 \nf.  Laundry \n12 \ng.  Living area clean-up/janitorial \n13 \nh.  Evening workers (facility janitorial) \n14 \ni.  Maintenance \n15 \n45.  In the course of their labor and employment by CoreCivic, detainees employed in the \n16 \nWork Program performed a wide range of work, including but not limited to: \n17 \n18  a.  Scrubbing bathrooms, showers, toilets, and windows; \n19  b.  Cleaning and maintaining CoreCivicโs on-site medical facility;  \n20 \nc.  Cleaning patient rooms and medical staff offices; \n21 \nd.  Sweeping, mopping, stripping, and waxing floors throughout the facility; \n22 \ne.  Washing detainee laundry; \n23 \nf.  Preparing, cooking, and serving detainee meals; \n24 \ng.  Washing dishes; \n25 \nh.  Cleaning the kitchen and cafeteria before and after detainee meals; \n26 \n27  i.  Performing clerical work for CoreCivic;  \n28  j.  Running and managing the law library; \n  9   \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-AJB-NLS   Document 1   Filed 12/27/17   PageID.10   Page 10 of 25\n \n1  k.  Providing barber services to detainees; \n2 \nl.  Cleaning intake areas and solitary confinement units; and \n3 \nm. Cleaning and maintaining recreational areas. \n4 \n46.  The Work Program allows CoreCivic to avoid recruiting from the traditional labor \n5 \nmarket,  complying  with  the  terms  of  its  union  contracts,  and  paying  all  costs  associated  with \n6 \npotential, current, and former employment relationships, thereby reducing operational costs and \n7 \nincreasing its own profits. \n8 \n9  47.  CoreCivic  does  not  pay  and  has  not  paid  detainees  the  state  minimum  wage  โ \n10  currently, $10.50 per hour โ for the hours they worked at the Otay Mesa Facility. \n11 \n48.  CoreCivicโs contract with ICE requires CoreCivic to comply with all federal, state, \n12 \nand local laws.  \n13 \n49.  No clause in CoreCivicโs contract with ICE or any rule or standard incorporated by \n14 \nreference into the contract requires CoreCivic to maximize its profits by paying detainees sub-\n15 \nminimum wages.  \n16 \n50.  CoreCivicโs pay policies violate Californiaโs minimum wage laws. \n17 \n18  PLAINTIFFSโ EMPLOYMENT AT THE OTAY MESA FACILITY \n19  A.  Plaintiff Carlos Gonzalez \n20 \n51.  Mr. Gonzalez is citizen of El Salvador and an asylum seeker in the United States.  He \n21 \nlives with his family in Bakersfield, California.       \n22 \n52.  Mr. Gonzalez was detained at the Otay Mesa Facility from approximately May 7, 2017 \n23 \nto approximately November 30, 2017. He was detained along with his stepson, Plaintiff Juan Jose \n24 \nMerino-Rodas.    \n25 \n53.  Mr. Gonzalez has performed work for CoreCivic at the Otay Mesa Facility and was \n26 \n27  not paid the state minimum wage for the work he has performed. \n28 \n  10   \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-AJB-NLS   Document 1   Filed 12/27/17   PageID.11   Page 11 of 25\n \n1  54.  As a kitchen worker, Mr. Gonzalez prepared, cooked, and served meals, washed \n2 \ndishes, and cleaned the kitchen area. He worked six-hour shifts, starting at 3:00 am, up to seven days \n3 \nper week. He used cleaning supplies and equipment provided by CoreCivic.    \n4 \n55.  When he was hired to work in the kitchen, Mr. Gonzalez was forced to sign a waiver \n5 \nof his workersโ compensation rights.    \n6 \n56.  As a janitor, Mr. Gonzalez cleaned and maintained the intake area of the Facility. He \n7 \nworked three-hour shifts, up to seven days per week. He used cleaning supplies and equipment \n8 \n9  provided by CoreCivic.    \n10  57.  Mr. Gonzalez also worked for three weeks cleaning and maintaining the office of the \n11 \nFacility manager. He worked three-hour shifts, up to seven days per week. He used cleaning supplies \n12 \nand equipment provided by CoreCivic.  \n13 \n58.  Mr. Gonzalez worked in the Facility managerโs office because he was promised \n14 \npayment of $1 per day, plus soda and candy bars, in exchange for his labor. However, he never \n15 \nreceived any payment, soda, or candy bars โ or anything else โ for his work.     \n16 \n59.  In return for this labor in the kitchen, intake area, and the managerโs office, Mr. \n17 \n18  Gonzalez was paid $1 to $1.50 per day โ or nothing at all โ regardless of the number of hours he \n19  worked. CoreCivic credited these wages to Mr. Gonzalezโs commissary account periodically.  \n20 \n60.  Mr. Gonzalez spent his wages on food and vitamins from the Otay Mesa Facility \n21 \ncommissary, among other necessities. \n22 \n61.  Officers at the Otay Mesa Facility threatened to put Mr. Gonzalez in disciplinary \n23 \nsegregation, i.e., solitary confinement, revoke his family visitation and commissary access rights, and \n24 \nwithhold mail delivery if he stopped working or encouraged other detainees to stop working.   \n25 \n62.  If given a meaningful choice, Mr. Gonzalez would not have worked for less than \n26 \n27  minimum wage.  \n28 \n  11   \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-AJB-NLS   Document 1   Filed 12/27/17   PageID.12   Page 12 of 25\n \n1  63.  CoreCivic falsely led Mr. Gonzalez to believe the corporation could not pay him \n2 \nmore than $1.50 per day, despite the fact that it does so as a matter of course at several of its other \n3 \nimmigration detention facilities. \n4 \n64.  CoreCivic falsely led Mr. Gonzalez to believe that it could require him to work in the \n5 \nFacility Managerโs officer for no pay at all. \n6 \n65.  CoreCivic falsely led Mr. Gonzalez to believe he had to waive his protections under \n7 \nCaliforniaโs Workerโs Compensation laws while working as an employee at the facility. \n8 \n9  66.  CoreCivic  retained  the  value  of  Mr.  Gonzalezโs  labor  by  realizing  this  value  as \n10  corporate profits, rather than using it to provide for safer, more humane living conditions for \n11 \ndetainees at the Otay Mesa Facility. \n12 \nB.  Plaintiff Juan Jose Merino-Rodas \n \n13 \n67.  Mr. Merino-Rodas is citizen of El Salvador and an asylum seeker in the United States.  \n14 \nHe lives with his family in Bakersfield, California.       \n15 \n68.  Mr. Merino-Rodas was detained at the Otay Mesa Facility from May 2017 through \n16 \nNovember 2017.  \n17 \n18  69.  Mr. Merino-Rodas has performed work for CoreCivic at the Otay Mesa Facility and \n19  was not paid the state minimum wage for the work he has performed. \n20 \n70.  As a kitchen worker, Mr. Merino-Rodas washed dishes, prepared and cooked meals, \n21 \nand cleaned the kitchen area. He worked six-hour shifts, up to seven days per week. He used cleaning \n22 \nsupplies and equipment provided by CoreCivic. \n23 \n71.  While employed by CoreCivic as a kitchen worker, Mr. Merino-Rodas suffered an \n24 \nextremely painful burn to his arm that required medical treatment. CoreCivic denied Mr. Merino-\n25 \nRodas access to Californiaโs Workerโs Compensation protections and required him to return to work \n26 \n27  just one day laterโbefore he fully recovered. \n28 \n  12   \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-AJB-NLS   Document 1   Filed 12/27/17   PageID.13   Page 13 of 25\n \n1  72.  Detainee laborers at the Otay Mesa Facility have, like Mr. Merino-Rodas, suffered on-\n2 \nthe-job injuries for which they received inadequate treatment and compensation. \n3 \n73.  Mr. Merino-Rodas was also employed to clean and maintain the intake area of the \n4 \nFacility. In this role, he worked three-hour shifts, seven days per week. He used cleaning supplies and \n5 \nequipment provided by CoreCivic.  \n6 \n74.  In return for this labor, Mr. Merino-Rodas was paid $1.50 per day, regardless of the \n7 \nnumber of hours he worked. CoreCivic credited these wages to his commissary account periodically.  \n8 \n9  75.  Mr.  Merino-Rodas  spent  his  wages  on  food  and  medicine  from  the  Otay  Mesa \n10  Facility commissary, among other necessities. \n11 \n76.  Officers at the Otay Mesa Facility threatened to put Mr. Merino-Rodas in disciplinary \n12 \nsegregation, i.e., solitary confinement, if he stopped working or encouraged other detainees to stop \n13 \nworking.   \n14 \n77.  If given a meaningful choice, Mr. Merino-Rodas would not have worked for less than \n15 \nthe minimum wage.  \n16 \n78.  CoreCivic falsely led Mr. Merino-Rodas to believe the corporation could not pay him \n17 \n18  more than $1.50 per day, despite the fact that it does so as a matter of course at several of its other \n19  immigration detention facilities. \n20 \n79.  CoreCivic falsely led Mr. Merino-Rodas to believe he had to waive his protections \n21 \nunder Californiaโs Workerโs Compensation laws while working as an employee at the facility. \n22 \n80.  CoreCivic retained the value of Mr. Merino-Rodasโ labor by realizing this value as \n23 \ncorporate profits, rather than using it to provide for safer, more humane living conditions for \n24 \ndetainees at the Otay Mesa Facility. \n25 \nC.  Plaintiff Maribel Gutierrez-Canchola \n26 \n27  81.  Ms. Gutierrez-Canchola is a citizen of Mexico and an asylum seeker in the United \n28  States.          \n  13   \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-AJB-NLS   Document 1   Filed 12/27/17   PageID.14   Page 14 of 25\n \n1  82.  Ms. Gutierrez-Canchola is currently detained at the Otay Mesa Facility. She has been \n2 \ndetained there since approximately June 17, 2017.  \n3 \n83.  Ms. Gutierrez-Canchola performs work for CoreCivic at the Otay Mesa Facility, and \n4 \nis not paid the state minimum wage for the work she performs. \n5 \n84.  As  a  janitor,  Ms.  Gutierrez-Canchola  cleans  and  maintains  bathrooms,  showers, \n6 \nkitchens, lobbies, stairwells, offices, and other areas through the Facility. She works up to six hours \n7 \nper day, five days a week.  She uses cleaning supplies and equipment provided by CoreCivic. \n8 \n9  85.  In return for this labor, Ms. Gutierrez-Canchola is paid $1.50 per day, regardless of \n10  the  number  of  hours  she  works.  CoreCivic  credits  these  wages  to  Ms.  Gutierrez-Cancholaโs \n11 \ncommissary account periodically.  \n12 \n86.  Ms. Gutierrez-Canchola spends her wages on food, medicine, clothing, soap, and \n13 \nshampoo from the Otay Mesa Facility commissary, among other necessities. \n14 \n87.  If given a meaningful choice, Ms. Gutierrez-Canchola would not work for less than \n15 \nthe minimum wage.  \n16 \n88.  CoreCivic falsely led Ms. Gutierrez-Canchola to believe the corporation cannot pay \n17 \n18  her more than $1.50 per day, despite the fact that it does so as a matter of course at several of its \n19  other immigration detention facilities.  \n20 \n89.  CoreCivic has retained and currently retains the value of Ms. Gutierrez-Cancholaโs \n21 \nlabor by realizing this value as corporate profits, rather than using it to provide for safer, more \n22 \nhumane living conditions for detainees at the Otay Mesa Facility. \n23 \nD.  Plaintiff Gladys Carrera-Duarte \n24 \n90.  Ms. Carrera-Duarte is a citizen of Guatemala and an asylum seeker in the United \n25 \nStates.          \n26 \n27  91.  Ms. Carrera-Duarte is currently detained at the Otay Mesa Facility. She has been \n28  detained there since approximately June 30, 2017.  \n  14   \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-AJB-NLS   Document 1   Filed 12/27/17   PageID.15   Page 15 of 25\n \n1  92.

Ms.  Carrera-Duarte  spends  her  wages  on  food,  medicine,  clothing,  soap,  and \n10  shampoo from the Otay Mesa Facility commissary, among other necessities. \n11 \n96.  If given a meaningful choice, Ms. Carrera-Duarte would not work for $1.50 per day.  \n12 \n97.  CoreCivic falsely led Ms. Carrera-Duarte to believe the corporation cannot pay her \n13 \nmore than $1.50 per day, despite the fact that it does so as a matter of course at several of its other \n14 \nimmigration detention facilities.  \n15 \n98.  CoreCivic has retained and currently retains the value of Ms. Carrera-Duarteโs labor \n16 \nby realizing this value as corporate profits, rather than using it to provide for safer, more humane \n17 \n18  living conditions for detainees at the Otay Mesa Facility. \n19  E.  Plaintiff Jennye Pagoada-Lopez  \n20 \n99.  Ms. Pagoada-Lopez is a citizen of Honduras and an asylum seeker in the United \n21 \nStates.          \n22 \n100.  Ms. Pagoada-Lopez is currently detained at the Otay Mesa Facility. She has been \n23 \ndetained there since approximately June 24, 2017.  \n24 \n101.  Ms. Pagoada-Lopez performs work for CoreCivic at the Otay Mesa Facility, and is \n25 \nnot paid the state minimum wage for the work she performs. \n26 \n27  102.  Ms. Pagoada-Lopez was employed for approximately six weeks as a janitor. She \n28  cleaned and maintained bathrooms, showers, kitchens, lobbies, stairwells, offices, and other areas \n  15   \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-AJB-NLS   Document 1   Filed 12/27/17   PageID.16   Page 16 of 25\n \n1  through the Facility. She worked up to six hours per day, five days a week.  She used cleaning \n2 \nsupplies and equipment provided by CoreCivic.  \n3 \n103.  In return for this labor, Ms. Pagoada-Lopez was paid $1.50 per day, regardless of the \n4 \nnumber  of  hours  she  worked.  CoreCivic  credited  these  wages  to  her  commissary  account \n5 \nperiodically.  \n6 \n104.  Currently, Ms. Pagoada-Lopez cleans and maintains communal areas in her pod. She \n7 \nworks for up to two hours each day.    \n8 \n9  105.  In return for this labor, Ms. Pagoada-Lopez is paid nothing at all. Occasionally, \n10  CoreCivic has given Ms. Pagoada-Lopez extra rations of toilet paper and shampoo in exchange for \n11 \nher labor.    \n12 \n106.  Ms.  Pagoada-Lopez  spends  her  wages  on  food,  medicine,  clothing,  soap,  and \n13 \nshampoo  from  the  Otay  Mesa  Facility  commissary,  among  other  necessities.  She  has  lost \n14 \napproximately 30 pounds in detention at the Otay Mesa Facility. \n15 \n107.  If given a meaningful choice, Ms. Pagoada-Lopez would not work for $1.50 per day \n16 \nor for free.  \n17 \n18  108.  CoreCivic falsely led Ms. Pagoada-Lopez to believe the corporation cannot pay her \n19  more than $1.50 per day, despite the fact that it does so as a matter of course at several of its other \n20 \nimmigration detention facilities.  \n21 \n109.  CoreCivic has retained and currently retains the value of Ms. Pagoada-Lopezโs labor \n22 \nby realizing this value as corporate profits, rather than using it to provide for safer, more humane \n23 \nliving conditions for detainees at the Otay Mesa Facility. \n24 \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n25 \n110.  Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit as a class action on behalf of themselves, and all others \n26 \n27  similarly situated as members of the proposed class, under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and \n28 \n  16   \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-AJB-NLS   Document 1   Filed 12/27/17   PageID.17   Page 17 of 25\n \n1  (b)(2). This action satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality, adequacy, predominance, and \n2 \nsuperiority requirements of those provisions.  \n3 \nA.    Class Definitions \n4 \n111.  Plaintiffs seek to certify the following classes:  \n5 \na.  The Work Program Class: All civil immigration detainees who performed work \n6  for CoreCivic at the Otay Mesa Detention Center in the Work Program within \nthe past ten years. \n7 \n \nb.  The Unlawful Inducement Class:  All civil immigration detainees held at the \n8 \nOtay  Mesa  Facility  within  the  past  ten  years  who  performed  work  for  no \n9  compensation outside of their pods.   \n \n10  c.  The Injured Worker Class: All civil immigration detainees held at the Otay \nMesa Facility within the past ten years who were injured while performing work \n11 \nthrough CoreCivicโs Work Program and denied access to Californiaโs Workerโs \nCompensation benefits. \n12 \n \nd.  The Unpaid Cleaner Class: All civil immigration detainees held at the Otay \n13 \nMesa Facility who performed labor within their pods within the past ten years \n14  under threat of solitary confinement, and/or in exchange for basic necessities. \n \n15  112.  Excluded from the definition are the Sylvester Owino, Jonathan Gomez, defendants, \n16 \ntheir  officers,  directors,  management,  employees,  subsidiaries,  and  affiliates,  and  all  federal \n17 \ngovernmental  entities.  Plaintiffs  reserve  the  right  to  revise  the  Class  Definitions  based  upon \n18 \ninformation learned through discovery.  \n19 \nB.     Class Certification Requirements under Rule 23  \n20 \n113.  Numerosity: Each class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  \n21 \nPlaintiffs do not know the exact size of the class since that information is within the control of \n22 \n23  CoreCivic. However, upon information and belief, Plaintiffs allege that the number of class members \n24  is numbered in the thousands. Membership in the class is readily ascertainable from CoreCivicโs \n25 \ndetention and employment records.   \n26 \n27 \n28 \n  17   \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-AJB-NLS   Document 1   Filed 12/27/17   PageID.18   Page 18 of 25\n \n1  114.  Commonality and Predominance: There are numerous questions of law or fact \n2 \ncommon to the Class, and those issues predominate over any question affecting only individual class \n3 \nmembers. The common legal and factual issues include the following: \n4 \na.  Whether Plaintiffs and Class Members were entitled to the protections of the \n5 \nCalifornia Minimum Wage Act;  \n6 \nb.  Whether Plaintiffs and Class Members performed compensable work;    \n7 \nc.  Whether Plaintiffs and Class Members were paid $1 or $1.50 per day for their \n8 \n9  labor; \n10  d.  Whether CoreCivic engaged in conduct that violated California law โ including \n11 \nthe California Minimum Wage Act, the California Unfair Competition Law, and \n12 \nthe California Trafficking Victims Protection Act; \n13 \ne.  Whether  CoreCivic  engaged  in  conduct  that  violated  the  federal  Trafficking \n14 \nVictims Protection Act; \n15 \nf.  Whether Plaintiffs and Class Members are entitled to equitable relief, including \n16 \ninjunctive and declaratory relief; and  \n17 \n18  g.  Whether Plaintiffs and the Class Members are entitled to damages and other \n19  monetary relief and, if so, in what amount. \n20 \n115.  Typicality: The claims asserted by Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the Class, in \n21 \nthat  the  representative  Plaintiffs,  like  all  Class  Members,  were  paid  subminimum  wages  while \n22 \nemployed by CoreCivic at the Otay Mesa Facility.  Each member of the proposed Class has been \n23 \nsimilarly injured financially by CoreCivicโs misconduct. \n24 \n116.  Adequacy: Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class. \n25 \nPlaintiffs have retained attorneys experienced in class and complex litigation, including wage and \n26 \n27  hour class action litigation. Plaintiffs intend to vigorously prosecute this litigation. Neither Plaintiffs \n28  nor their counsel have interests that conflict with the interests of the other class members.  \n  18   \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-AJB-NLS   Document 1   Filed 12/27/17   PageID.19   Page 19 of 25\n \n1  117.  Superiority:  Plaintiffs and Class Members have all suffered and will continue to \n2 \nsuffer harm and damages as a result of CoreCivicโs wrongful conduct. A class action is superior to \n3 \nother available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy. Treatment as a class \n4 \naction will permit a large number of similarly situated persons to adjudicate their common claims in a \n5 \nsingle forum simultaneously, efficiently, and without the duplication of effort and expense that \n6 \nnumerous individual actions would engender. Class treatment will also permit the adjudication of \n7 \nclaims by many members of the proposed class who could not individually afford to litigate a claim \n8 \n9  such as is asserted in this complaint. This class action likely presents no difficulties in management \n10  that would preclude maintenance as a class action.  \n11 \n118.  This action satisfies the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) because CoreCivic has acted \n12 \nand refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the Class, thereby making appropriate final \n13 \ninjunctive and/or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to each Class Member. \n14 \nCAUSES OF ACTION \n15   \nCOUNT I \n16 \n  CALIFORNIA MINIMUM WAGE LAW \nCal. Labor Code ยงยง 1194, 1197, 1197.1 \n17 \n \n18  119.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference herein all allegations above.  \n19  120.  The California Legislature set the following minimum wages for 2011-2017:10 \n20 \nJanuary 1, 2017  $10.50 for employers with 26 employees or more \n21 \nJanuary 1, 2014  $9.00 \n22 \nJanuary 1, 2008  $8.00 \n23 \n \n24 \n121.  The minimum wage is an obligation of the employer and cannot be waived by any \n25 \n26  agreement.   \n27  122.  Detainees at the Otay Mesa Facility do not forfeit their rights to wage protections.  \n                                                 \n28 \n10 See http://www.dir.ca.gov/iwc/MinimumWageHistory.htm/; https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/faq_minimumwage.htm  \n  19   \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-AJB-NLS   Document 1   Filed 12/27/17   PageID.20   Page 20 of 25\n \n1  123.  Employees protected by Californiaโs minimum wage laws must be paid at least the set \n2 \nhourly minimum wage. \n3 \n124.  Detainees at the Otay Mesa Facility who participate in the Work Program qualify as \n4 \nemployees of CoreCivic under California law. \n5 \n125.  CoreCivic qualifies as an employer under California law.    \n6 \n126.  Labor in the immigration detention context is not intended as a punitive measure.      \n7 \n127.  CoreCivic does not compensate detainees the state minimum wage for the work they \n8 \n9  performed at the Otay Mesa Facility. Instead, CoreCivic pays detainees $1 or $1.50 per day โ or \n10  nothing at all โ for work they perform at its facility.  \n11 \n128.  Plaintiffs seek to recover, on their own behalf and on behalf of all others similarly \n12 \nsituated, unpaid minimum wages and costs of this suit.   \n13 \n129.  This Count applies to the Work Program Class, the Unlawful Inducement Class, the \n14 \nInjured Worker Class, and the Unpaid Cleaner Class.  \n15 \nCOUNT II \n16 \nUNJUST ENRICHMENT \nCalifornia Common Law \n17 \n18  130.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference herein all allegations above. \n19  131.  CoreCivic  materially  and  significantly  reduced  its  labor  costs  and  expenses,  and \n20 \nincreased its profits, because Plaintiffs and Class Members perform undercompensated labor. \n21 \n132.  Plaintiffs and Class Members conferred non-gratuitous benefits upon CoreCivic by \n22 \nperforming work for $1 or $1.50 per day, or for nothing at all, for which CoreCivic would otherwise \n23 \nhave had to pay at least the applicable minimum wage or more, thereby significantly and materially \n24 \nincreasing CoreCivicโs profits, unjustly enriching CoreCivic at the expense of and detriment to \n25 \nPlaintiffs and Class Members. \n26 \n27  133.  CoreCivicโs  retention  of  any  benefit  collected  directly  and  indirectly  from  this \n28  uncompensated labor violated principles of justice, equity, and good conscience.  \n  20   \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-AJB-NLS   Document 1   Filed 12/27/17   PageID.21   Page 21 of 25\n \n1  134.  As a direct and proximate result of CoreCivicโs forced labor practices, Plaintiffs and \n2 \nClass Members have suffered concrete harm and injury, including physical and emotional injury, \n3 \nmonetary loss, and the unlawful violation of their rights.     \n4 \n135.  Plaintiffs and Class Members are entitled to recover from CoreCivic all amounts that \n5 \nCoreCivic has wrongfully and improperly obtained, and CoreCivic should be required to disgorge to \n6 \nPlaintiffs and Class Members the benefits it has unjustly obtained. Plaintiffs and Class Members are \n7 \nalso entitled to recover exemplary damages. C.R.S. ยง 13- 21-102. \n8 \n9  136.  This Count applies to the Work Program Class, the Unlawful Inducement Class, the \n10  Injured Worker Class, and the Unpaid Cleaner Class.  \n11 \nCOUNT III \nCALIFORNIA UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW \n12 \nCal. Bus. & Prof. Code ยง 17200, et seq. \n13 \n137.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference herein all allegations above. \n14 \n138.  Californiaโs Unfair Competition Law (โUCLโ) prohibits unfair competition, defined \n15 \nas โany unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or \n16 \nmisleading advertising and any act prohibited by [Californiaโs False Advertising Law].โ  Cal. Bus. & \n17 \n18  Prof. Code ยง 17200. \n19  139.  CoreCivic willfully violated, and continues to violate, the โunlawfulโ prong of the \n20 \nUCL by violating California labor law. \n21 \n140.  The  acts,  omissions,  and  practices  of  CoreCivic  constitute  unfair  and  unlawful \n22 \nbusiness acts and practices under the UCL in that CoreCivicโs conduct offends public policy against \n23 \nforced labor, and seeks to profit by violating Plaintiffsโ rights under state and federal law.  \n24 \n141.  As a direct and proximate result of CoreCivicโs unlawful and unfair business practices, \n25 \nPlaintiffs and Class Members have suffered economic injury.   \n26 \n27  142.  This Count applies to the Work Program Class, the Unlawful Inducement Class, the \n28  Injured Worker Class, and the Unpaid Cleaner Class.  \n  21   \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-AJB-NLS   Document 1   Filed 12/27/17   PageID.22   Page 22 of 25\n \n1  COUNT IV \nCALIFORNIA TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION ACT \n2 \nCal. Civ. Code ยง 52.5 \n \n3 \n143.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference herein all allegations above. \n4 \n144.  Pursuant to the California Trafficking Victims Protection Act, Cal. Civ. Code ยง 52.5, \n5 \nโa victim of human trafficking, as defined in Section 236.1 of the Penal Code, may bring a civil action \n6 \nfor actual damages, compensatory damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief, any combination of \n7 \nthose, or any other appropriate relief.โ  \n8 \n9  145.  Human trafficking is defined as the deprivation or violation of the personal liberty of \n10  another โwith the intent to obtain forced labor or services.โ Cal. Penal Code ยง 236.1. \n11 \n146.  Forced  labor  or  services  is  defined  as  โlabor  or  services  that  are  performed  or \n12 \nprovided by a person and are obtained or maintained through force, fraud, duress, or coercion, or \n13 \nequivalent  conduct  that  would  reasonably  overbear  the  will  of  the  person.โ Cal.  Penal  Code \n14 \nยง 236.1(h)(5). \n15 \n147.  CoreCivic  materially  and  significantly  reduced  its  labor  costs  and  expenses,  and \n16 \nincreased its profits, by unlawfully forcing and coercing Plaintiffs and Class Members to perform \n17 \n18  uncompensated labor. In order to drive profits, CoreCivic acted with the intent to obtain forced \n19  labor or services from its detainees.  \n20 \n148.  As alleged herein, CoreCivic did not and does not provide detainees at the Otay Mesa \n21 \nFacility with sufficient provisions and necessities for daily life. In order to purchase these necessary \n22 \nitems, including food, medicine, hygiene products, and clothing, Plaintiffs and Class Members were \n23 \nand are forced or coerced to perform labor and services for CoreCivic for $1 or $1.50 per day.  \n24 \n149.  Plaintiffs and Class Members are entitled to recover from CoreCivic all amounts that \n25 \nCoreCivic has wrongfully and improperly obtained, and CoreCivic should be required to disgorge to \n26 \n27  Plaintiffs and Class Members the benefits it has unjustly obtained. Plaintiffs and Class Members are \n28  also entitled to recover exemplary damages.

Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference herein all allegations above. \n5 \n152.  Plaintiffs and Class Members are victims of attempted forced labor as defined by \n6 \n18 U.S.C. ยง 1589(a). \n7 \n153.  CoreCivic violates 18 U.S.C. ยง 1589(a)(2) by knowingly maintaining a corporate policy \n8 \n9  and uniform practice at the Otay Mesa Facility aimed at obtaining nearly free detainee labor and \n10  services by:   \n11 \na.  Withholding daily necessities from Plaintiffs and Class Members, thereby forcing \nthem to work for subminimum wages in order to buy those daily necessities for \n12 \nthemselves and avoid serious harm, including, but not limited to, malnutrition, \nunsanitary  living  quarters,  extreme  isolation,  and  unhygienic  conditions  of \n13 \nconfinement; and \n14   \nb.  Threatening Plaintiffs and Class Members with physical restraint, serious harm, \n15  and abuse of law or legal process if they refuse to provide their labor, organize a \nwork stoppage, or participate in a work stoppage. \n16 \n \n154.  CoreCivic further violated 18 U.S.C. ยง 1589 by maintaining a corporate policy and \n17 \n18  uniform practice at the Otay Mesa Facility of threatening Plaintiffs and Class Members with serious \n19  harm, including solitary confinement, referral to an ICE officer, or criminal prosecution if they \n20 \nrefused to work. \n21 \n155.  CoreCivic attempted to perpetrate the offense of forced labor against Plaintiffs and \n22 \nClass Members.  \n23 \n156.
