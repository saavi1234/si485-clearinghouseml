    "summary": "<p>On August 17, 2018, 29 parents who were forcibly separated from their children by the federal government filed this lawsuit in U.S. District Court of District Columbia. The plaintiffs sued the Department of Justice for violating the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. §§ 1101 <i>et seq.</i>), the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. § 701), the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. §§ 551 <i>et seq.</i>), and the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The Plaintiffs, represented by Muslim Advocates as well as the Legal Aid Justice Center and the law firm of Eversheds & Sunderland, LLP, sought an order compelling the defendants to vacate the results of credible fear interviews, which had found them eligible for removal, as well as the resulting orders of removal. The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and new credible fear interviews. </p><p>Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that under DOJ policy, parents were forced to undergo credible fear interviews while they were suffering from emotional and psychological trauma from being separated from their children. Credible fear interviews determine whether an asylum seeker faces a credible fear of persecution or torture when returned to their home country. Unable to articulate their experiences due to trauma, the plaintiffs received negative credible fear determinations and faced immediate deportation. </p><p>This case was assigned to Judge Paul L. Friedman. </p><p>On August 17, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a motion to proceed under pseudonyms and a redacted complaint. The defendant filed a motion to extend time to file an answer on October 22, 2018. On December 31, 2018, the defendant again filed such a motion.</p><p>Along with two related cases, MMM v. Sessions and Ms. L v. ICE, this case settled. On November 15, 2018, Judge Dana M. Sabraw (the judge assigned in Ms. L. v. ICE) issued a final approval of the settlement. According to this settlement, the government committed to conducting a good faith review of the plaintiff’s prior credible fear findings to determine if reconsideration would be appropriate. However, the government refused to return any parent who had already been deported.  </p><p>On February 5, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a notice of voluntary dismissal. This case is now closed, but the court in Ms. L v. ICE retained jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement. For more information on that case, including disputes that have developed over the settlement's terms, see <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16620\">here</a>. </p><p></p>",

The form and method by which notice was given to the Settlement \n3  Classes  met  the  requirements  of  due  process,  Rules  23(c)(2)  and  23(e)  of  the \n4  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, constituted the best notice practicable under the \n5  circumstances,  and  constituted  due  and  sufficient  notice  to  all  persons  entitled \n6  thereto. \n7  3.  The  Court  finds  that:  (a)  the  Settlement  is  fair,  reasonable,  and \n8  adequate  in  accordance  with  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  23(e)(2);  (b)  the  Agreement  was \n9  negotiated at arm’s length by experienced counsel acting in good faith; and (c) there \n10  has been adequate opportunity for experienced counsel to evaluate the claims and \n11  risks at this stage of the litigation. \n12  4.  The  Court  has  reviewed  the  six  objections  filed  regarding  the \n13  Settlement and carefully considered each of the issues raised by those filings, and \n14  finds that the objections do not impact the conclusion that the Settlement is fair, \n15  reasonable, and adequate. \n16  5.  The Court therefore finds that final approval is appropriate and hereby \n17  grants final approval of the Settlement.  The parties are directed to consummate the \n18  Agreement according to its terms.  The Agreement and every term thereof shall be \n19  deemed incorporated herein as if explicitly set forth and shall have the full force of \n20  an Order of the Court. \n21  Certification  of  the  Settlement  Classes,  Appointment  of  Settlement  Class \n22  Representatives, and Appointment of Co-Lead Counsel \n23  6.  For purposes of the Settlement, and only for that purpose, and without \n24  an adjudication on the merits, pursuant to Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(2) of the Federal \n25  Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court finds that the requirements for a class action are \n26  met, and hereby defines the following classes. \n27  The class of parents is defined as follows:  \n28   \nORDER CERTIFYING SETTLEMENT CLASSES \nHOGAN LLLOPV ELLS US    - 3 -  AND GRANTING FINAL APPROVAL OF CLASS  PROPOSED ORDER  \nATTORNEYS AT LAW  ACTION SETTLEMENT  \nLOS ANGELES   \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 321   Filed 11/15/18   PageID.4955   Page 4 of 6\n \n1  All adult alien parents who entered the United States at or between \ndesignated ports of entry with their child(ren), and who, on or before \n2  the effective date of this agreement: (1) were detained in immigration \ncustody by the DHS; (2) have a child who was or is separated from \n3  them by DHS and, on or after June 26, 2018, was housed in ORR \ncustody, ORR foster care, or DHS custody, absent a determination \n4  that the parent is unfit or presents a danger to the child; and (3) have \nbeen  (and  whose  child(ren)  have  been)  continuously  physically \n5  present  within  the  United  States  since  June  26,  2018,  whether  in \ndetention or released. The class does not include alien parents with \n6  criminal histories or a communicable disease, or those encountered in \nthe interior of the United States.1 \n7 \nThe class of children is defined as follows: \n8 \nAll alien children who are under the age of 18 on the effective date of \n9  this  agreement  who:  (1) entered  the  United  States  at  or  between \ndesignated ports of entry with an alien parent, and who were separated \n10  from their parents, on or before the effective date of this settlement \nagreement;  (2) have  been  or  will  be  reunified  with  that  parent \n11  pursuant to the preliminary injunction issued by the Court in Ms. L v. \nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, No. 18-428 (S.D.

The  Court  finds  that  certification  of  the  Settlement  Classes  is \n15 \nwarranted in light of the Settlement under the prerequisites of Federal Rule of Civil \n16 \nProcedure  23(a)  because:  (1) the  members  of  the  Settlement  Classes  are  so \n17 \nnumerous that joinder is impracticable; (2) there are issues of law and fact common \n18 \nto the Settlement Classes; (3) the claims of the named Plaintiffs in M.M.M., Ms. L, \n19 \nand  Dora  are  typical  of  the  claims  of  the  Settlement  Class  Members;  and \n20 \n(4) Plaintiffs and Class Counsel will fairly and adequately represent the interests of \n21 \nthe Settlement Class Members. \n22 \n8.  The  Court  also  finds  that  certification  of  the  Settlement  Classes  is \n23 \nwarranted in light of the Settlement under the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil \n24 \nProcedure 23(b)(2) because Defendants are alleged to have acted or refused to act \n25 \n                                           \n1   References to a “class” or “class member” in the Agreement refer to the \n26 \nclasses described in the text, as well as alien parents who are not part of the Ms. L \nclass  due  to  criminal  history  or  communicable  disease,  but  who  the  Court  has \n27 \nordered must be reunified. The Agreement also addresses parents who are covered \nby the above description, but who have been removed from the United States.   \n28 \nORDER CERTIFYING SETTLEMENT CLASSES \nHOGAN LLLOPV ELLS US    - 4 -  AND GRANTING FINAL APPROVAL OF CLASS  PROPOSED ORDER  \nATTORNEYS AT LAW  ACTION SETTLEMENT  \nLOS ANGELES   \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 321   Filed 11/15/18   PageID.4956   Page 5 of 6\n \n1  on grounds that apply generally to the Settlement Classes, so that final injunctive \n2  relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the Settlement \n3  Classes as a whole. \n4  9.  The Court hereby appoints the named Plaintiffs in M.M.M. and Ms. L. \n5  (as recently amended) as Settlement Class Representatives. The Court finds that the \n6  Settlement Class Representatives will fairly and adequately protect the interests of \n7  the  Settlement  Classes  because:  (1) the  interests  of  the  Settlement  Class \n8  Representatives are consistent with those of Settlement Class Members; (2) there \n9  appear to be no conflicts between or among the Settlement Class Representatives \n10  and the other Settlement Class Members; (3) the Settlement Class Representatives \n11  have been and appear to be capable of continuing to be active participants in both \n12  the prosecution and the settlement of this litigation; and (4) the Settlement Class \n13  Representatives  and  Settlement  Class  Members  are  represented  by  qualified, \n14  reputable  counsel  who  are  experienced  in  preparing  and  prosecuting  large, \n15  complicated class action cases, including those concerning alleged violations of the \n16  relevant laws. \n17  10.  The  requirements  of  Rule  23(g)  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil \n18  Procedure are met, and the Court hereby confirms the appointment of the law firm \n19  Eversheds  Sutherland,  Muslim  Advocates,  and  the  Legal  Aid  Justice  Center  as \n20  counsel  for  the  parent  class  for  parents  continuously  physically  present  in  the \n21  United States since June 26, 2018, the ACLU as counsel for parents who have been \n22  removed, and Hogan Lovells US LLP as counsel for the child class. \n23  Other Provisions \n24  11.  Neither the Agreement, nor any of its terms or provisions, nor any of \n25  the negotiations or  proceedings in connection  with it, shall  be  construed  as  an \n26  admission  or  concession  by  Defendants  of  the  truth  of  any  allegations  in  the \n27  litigation, or of any fault or wrongdoing of any kind, or of a lack of merit of \n28  Plaintiffs’ allegations. \nORDER CERTIFYING SETTLEMENT CLASSES \nHOGAN LLLOPV ELLS US    - 5 -  AND GRANTING FINAL APPROVAL OF CLASS  PROPOSED ORDER  \nATTORNEYS AT LAW  ACTION SETTLEMENT  \nLOS ANGELES   \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 321   Filed 11/15/18   PageID.4957   Page 6 of 6\n \n1  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n2     \nDated:  November 15, 2018   \n3 \n4 \n5 \n \n6 \n7   \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \nORDER CERTIFYING SETTLEMENT CLASSES \nHOGAN LLLOPV ELLS US    - 6 -  AND GRANTING FINAL APPROVAL OF CLASS  PROPOSED ORDER  \nATTORNEYS AT LAW  ACTION SETTLEMENT  \nLOS ANGELES   ",

      "text": "Case 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 220-1   Filed 09/12/18   PageID.3439   Page 1 of 7\nPlan to address the asylum claims of class-member parents and children who are physically \npresent in the United States \nThe government is willing to agree to the following procedures for addressing the asylum claims \nof M.M.M. agreed class members and the claims of Ms. L class members (and Dora plaintiffs), \nother than those class members who agree to waive these procedures (and thus to waive any further \nclaims  or  relief).1 (In  this  document,  references  to  Ms.  L  class  members  encompass Dora \nplaintiffs.) Class counsel are responsible for determining a class member’s intentions related to \nwaiver of the procedures set forth below. Upon approval of this agreed-upon plan by the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Southern District of California, M.M.M. agreed class members agree to \ndismiss their pending litigation in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, and to \nrefrain from seeking preliminary injunctive relief in their litigation pending in the U.S. District \nCourt for the Southern District of California; Dora plaintiffs agree to dismiss their pending \nlitigation in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia; and M.M.M. agreed class members \nand Ms. L class members agree to refrain from additional litigation seeking immigration- or \nasylum-related  injunctive,  declaratory,  or  equitable  relief  that  arises  from  the  facts  and \ncircumstances set forth in the Ms. L, M.M.M., and Dora complaints relating to those parents and \nchildren covered by this plan, including statutory claims. This plan applies only to Ms. L class \nmembers and M.M.M. agreed class members who have been continuously physically present in \nthe United States since June 26, 2018, and does not set any precedent for any additional group of \naliens, and any exercise of legal authority or discretion taken pursuant to this plan is exercised only \nto effectuate the implementation of this plan in relation to this group of individuals. The Court’s \napproval of this agreement will resolve the pending preliminary-injunction motion in M.M.M. and \nwill also lift the TRO issued in that matter. The Court will retain jurisdiction to enforce the \nprovisions of this plan, which represents the substantive terms for the implementation of a \nsettlement agreement and supersedes the prior written or oral communications between the parties \nregarding this plan.  \n1.   a.  Ms. L class members and M.M.M. agreed class members who are not currently detained in \nDHS custody (and are not currently in HHS custody) and who have been issued Notices to \n                                                      \n1 The classes of individuals to whom this plan relates include: \nMs. L Class Members and Dora Plaintiffs: All adult alien parents who entered the United States at or between \ndesignated ports of entry with their child(ren), and who, on or before the effective date of this agreement: (1) were \ndetained in immigration custody by the DHS; (2) have a child who was or is separated from them by DHS and, on or \nafter June 26, 2018, was housed in ORR custody, ORR foster care, or DHS custody, absent a determination that the \nparent is unfit or presents a danger to the child; and (3) have been (and whose child(ren) have been) continuously \nphysically present within the United States since June 26, 2018, whether in detention or released. The class does not \ninclude alien parents with criminal histories or a communicable disease, or those encountered in the interior of the \nUnited States.  \nM.M.M. Agreed Class Members: All alien children who are under the age of 18 on the effective date of this \nagreement who: (1) entered the United States at or between designated ports of entry with an alien parent, and who \nwere separated from their parents, on or before the effective date of this settlement agreement; (2) have been or will \nbe reunified with that parent pursuant to the preliminary injunction issued by the Court in Ms. L v. U.S. Immigration \nand Customs Enforcement, No. 18-428 (S.D. Cal. June 26, 2018); and (3) have been continuously physically present \nin the United States since June 26, 2018. \n \nAll references to a “class” or “class member” in this document refer to the classes described above, as well as alien \nparents who are not part of the Ms. L class due to criminal history or communicable disease, but who the Court has \nordered must be reunified. \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 220-1   Filed 09/12/18   PageID.3440   Page 2 of 7\nAppear (NTAs) will not be removed by DHS prior to issuance of a final removal order in \ntheir resulting removal proceedings conducted under Section 240 of the Immigration and \nNationality Act (INA). If a Ms. L class member or M.M.M. agreed class member was \nreleased from DHS or ORR custody, is not currently in Section 240 removal proceedings, \nand is not subject to a final removal order, that individual can affirmatively apply for \nasylum before U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), USCIS will adjudicate \nsuch an application regardless of whether an unfiled NTA exists, and USCIS will follow \nits established procedures concerning a parent’s involvement in his or her minor child’s \nasylum application process. If an M.M.M. agreed class member (whether currently detained \nor released) received a final removal order in Section 240 removal proceedings prior to \nreunification, DHS and HHS will work in good faith with M.M.M. counsel to identify such \nchildren within 15 days of approval of this agreement, and DHS will join in a motion to \nreopen those proceedings if requested by the M.M.M. agreed class member no later than \n45 days from approval of this agreement. M.M.M. agreed class members who have not \nbeen reunified with their parent(s) as of the effective date of this agreement will be afforded \nexisting procedures for unaccompanied alien children pursuant to governing statutes and \nregulations, including but not limited to Section 240 removal proceedings, unless and until \nthey are reunified with a parent, in which case the procedures described below will apply. \nb.  If a detained, reunited M.M.M. agreed class member child has been served with an NTA, \nbut the NTA has not been filed with an immigration court, DHS will exercise its discretion \nunder 8 C.F.R. § 239.2(a) to cancel the NTA within 15 days of the Court’s approval of this \nagreement. For such a child who either had an NTA cancelled in this way, or who has never \nbeen served with an NTA, if the child is an arriving alien or was initially encountered by \nDHS within 14 days of entry and 100 miles of the border, ICE will then initiate expedited \nremoval (ER) proceedings under Section 235 of the INA against the child. Where such a \nclass member child asserts, or has already asserted, an intention to apply for asylum or a \nfear of persecution or torture, either directly or through counsel, they shall be referred to \nUSCIS for a credible fear determination. \nc.   If a detained, reunited M.M.M. agreed class member child has been issued an NTA that has \nbeen filed with an immigration court and the child is an arriving alien or was initially \nencountered by DHS within 14 days of entry and 100 miles of the border, DHS will file a \nmotion to dismiss the pending Section 240 proceeding, seeking to do so jointly with the \nchild’s immigration attorney of record, as practicable. Such a motion shall be filed within \n30 days of the Court’s approval of this agreement and shall request expedited consideration \nby the immigration court. Upon dismissal of the Section 240 proceeding, ICE will initiate \nexpedited removal proceedings under Section 235 of the INA against the child. Where such \na class member child asserts, or has already asserted, an intention to apply for asylum or a \nfear of persecution or torture, either directly or through counsel, they shall be referred to \nUSCIS for a credible fear determination.  \nd.  For Ms. L class members who have not been issued an NTA and have final ER orders that \nhave not been cancelled by DHS, USCIS will exercise its discretionary authority to sua \nsponte conduct in good faith a de novo review of the credible fear finding of the parent to \ndetermine if reconsideration of the negative determination is warranted. During that review \nprocess for Ms. L class members, USCIS will review the parent’s case and the information \nprovided and determine whether the individual has a credible fear of persecution or torture. \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 220-1   Filed 09/12/18   PageID.3441   Page 3 of 7\nFor the limited purpose of this settlement agreement, USCIS will speak with the individual \nagain for additional fact-gathering and the individual may present new or additional \ninformation at this time, with the assistance of the individual’s counsel in-person unless \nICE determines in good faith that in-person participation would adversely impact facility \nsecurity or operations due to facility staffing, configuration, or access policies, in which \ncase  counsel  will  be  permitted  to  participate  telephonically,  provided  that  counsel’s \nattendance is at no expense to the government and does not unreasonably delay the process. \nIn determining whether any factual inconsistencies between the original interview and the \nsubsequent fact-gathering impact the credibility of the parent, due consideration will be \ngiven to the psychological state of the parent at the time of the initial interview. If the parent \nestablishes that he or she can meet the credible fear standard, as it is described at Section \n235(b)(1)(B)(v) of the INA and 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(e)(2) and (3), then DHS will issue and \nsubsequently file an NTA. The children will be treated as the parent’s dependents under 8 \nC.F.R. § 208.30(b). If the parent’s credible fear determination remains negative, USCIS \nwill screen the child individually  for  credible  fear. The parent will be permitted to \nparticipate in the child(ren)’s credible fear interview and provide testimony on behalf of \nthe child(ren), in addition to any testimony from the child(ren). Counsel for the child will \nbe permitted to attend the interview in person unless ICE determines in good faith that in-\nperson participation would adversely impact facility security or operations due to facility \nstaffing, configuration, or access policies, in which case counsel will be permitted to \nparticipate telephonically, so long as it does not unreasonably delay the process and any \nattorney assistance is at no expense to the government. \ne.  For Ms. L class members who are currently detained2 with their M.M.M. agreed class \nmember child(ren) at an ICE FRC and are subject to reinstated orders of removal, ICE will \ninitiate  ER  proceedings  under  Section  235  against  the  minor  child(ren),  upon  a \ndetermination that the child was initially encountered within 14 days of entry and 100 miles \nof the border. During those proceedings, the child(ren) will be referred for a credible fear \ndetermination if the child(ren) asserts, or has already asserted, a fear of return, either directly \nor through counsel. The credible fear claim will then be considered under the standards of \n8 C.F.R. § 208.30, as described above. USCIS will conduct the credible fear interview of \nthe child(ren) in coordination with a sua sponte review of the reasonable fear determination \nfor the parents to determine whether reconsideration of the negative reasonable fear \ndetermination is warranted. \nUSCIS will review the parent’s case and the information provided and determine whether \nthe individual has a reasonable fear of persecution or torture. For the limited purpose of \nthis settlement agreement, USCIS will speak with the individual again for additional fact-\ngathering and the individual may present new or additional information at this time, with \nthe assistance of the individual’s counsel in-person unless ICE determines in good faith \nthat in-person participation is impracticable or would adversely impact facility security or \noperations due to facility staffing, configuration, or access policies, in which case counsel \nwill be permitted to participate telephonically, provided that counsel’s attendance is at no \nexpense to the government and does not unreasonably delay the process. In determining \nwhether any factual inconsistencies between the original interview and the subsequent fact-\n                                                      \n2 This agreement does not impact the ability of Ms. L class members with reinstated orders of removal who are not \ndetained to pursue any available appeal of such an order under existing law and subject to statutory time periods. \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 220-1   Filed 09/12/18   PageID.3442   Page 4 of 7\ngathering impact the credibility of the parent, due consideration will be given to the \npsychological state of the parent at the time of the initial interview. If the parent establishes \nthat he or she can meet the reasonable fear standard, as it is described at 8 C.F.R. \n§ 208.31(c), then DHS will place the parent in withholding-only proceedings. The parent \nwill be permitted to participate in the child(ren)’s credible fear interview and provide \ntestimony on behalf of the child(ren), in addition to any testimony from the child(ren). \nCounsel for the child will be permitted to attend the interview in person unless ICE \ndetermines in good faith that in-person participation is impracticable or would adversely \nimpact facility security or operations due to facility staffing, configuration, or access, in \nwhich case counsel will be permitted to participate telephonically, so long as it does not \nunreasonably delay the  process and  any attorney  assistance is at no  expense to the \ngovernment. \nf.   If the parent’s credible fear or reasonable fear finding remains negative upon review, \nUSCIS will notify the parent in writing that USCIS declines to reconsider the existing \nnegative credible fear or reasonable fear determination. If the child receives a separate \nnegative credible fear determination, the child may seek review by an immigration judge. \ng.  For purposes of the reviews and interviews of detained parents and/or children described \nin this proposal, the government shall provide the parent and/or child with the orientation \nthat is normally provided for credible fear interviews, and shall provide at least 5 days’ \nnotice of such orientation. Notice of the orientation shall be provided no later than 3 days \nfollowing the parent and/or child’s execution of a document reflecting his or her decision \npursuant to paragraph 8 of this agreement, and the notice shall state the purpose of the \nnotice (orientation for an interview or review) and the date, time, and location of the \norientation. Such reviews and interviews will be conducted at least 48 hours after the \norientation, with due consideration given to any reasonable requests to continue the \ninterview. The notice and time periods described in this paragraph will not apply if a parent \naffirmatively requests, in writing, that the review or interview take place on an expedited \nbasis. \n2.  In the case of a parent and child(ren) both in ER proceedings under the process described \nabove, if either the parent or the child establishes a credible fear of persecution or torture, \nUSCIS will issue NTAs to both parent and child and place the family in Section 240 removal \nproceedings. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 208.30(f) (positive credible fear finding made by USCIS), \n1208.30(g)(2)(iv)(B) (positive credible fear finding made by immigration judge). \n3.  In the case of a parent and child(ren) both in ER proceedings under the process described \nabove, if none of the family members establish credible fear of persecution or torture (and \nin the case of a child who seeks review of the credible fear finding by an immigration judge, \nsuch finding is upheld by an immigration judge), the ER orders may immediately be \nexecuted. \n4.  In the case of a parent who is subject to a reinstated order of removal, if the child(ren) \nestablishes credible fear and the parent does not establish a reasonable fear, the child(ren) \nwould be placed in Section 240 removal proceedings and the parent would at that time be \nsubject to continued detention or release, in DHS’s discretion, consistent with paragraph 7 \nbelow. DHS will not remove a Ms. L class member who received a negative reasonable \nfear finding while his or her M.M.M. agreed class member child goes through the credible \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 220-1   Filed 09/12/18   PageID.3443   Page 5 of 7\nfear process and, if applicable, Section 240 removal proceedings. Plaintiffs concede, \nhowever, that removal of any Ms. L class member with a reinstated removal order under \nthis agreement is significantly likely to occur in the reasonably foreseeable future and that, \nif a parent initiates legal proceedings challenging their continued detention, DHS may \nimmediately proceed with that Ms. L class member’s removal, regardless of any injunctive \norders issued in Ms. L and M.M.M., provided that DHS gives the parent at least 7 days’ \nadvance notice to the parent that he or she will be removed. \n5.  In the case of a parent who is subject to a reinstated order of removal, if the child(ren) \nestablish credible fear and the parent establishes a reasonable fear, the child(ren) would be \nissued NTAs and placed in Section 240 removal proceedings, and the parent would be \nreferred  for  withholding-only  proceedings  pursuant  to  8  C.F.R.  §§  1208.2(c)(2)  and \n1208.31(e). \n6.  If a Ms. L. class member who is currently detained3 in an ICE FRC with his or her M.M.M. \nagreed class member child is subject to a final removal order issued in proceedings conducted \nunder Section 240 (other than a reinstated order) and the child is an arriving alien or was \ninitially encountered by DHS within 14 days of entry and 100 miles of the border, ICE would \ninitiate ER proceedings under Section 235 against the child within 7 days of the Court’s \napproval of this agreement, and refer the child for a credible fear interview. While the final \norder parent would not be a party to the child’s credible fear adjudication, the parent would \nbe available to consult with and assist the child in the course of that process. The parent \nwould be permitted to participate in the child(ren)’s credible fear interview and provide \ntestimony on behalf of the child(ren), in addition to any testimony from the child(ren). \nCounsel for the child will be permitted to attend the interview in person, so long as it does \nnot unreasonably delay the process and any attorney assistance is at no expense to the \ngovernment, and the timing of the interview will be in accordance with Paragraph 1.g. \nabove. If the child establishes a credible fear of persecution or torture, USCIS will place \nthe child in Section 240 removal proceedings, and ICE will move for reopening of the \nparent’s prior removal proceedings and consolidation of the parent’s case with the child’s \nbefore the immigration court. If the child does not establish credible fear of persecution or \ntorture, the removal orders may immediately be executed. \n7.  Detention and custody decisions for aliens covered by this plan will be made consistent \nwith DHS’s authorities under Sections 235, 236, and 241, and the Order Granting Joint \nMotion Regarding Scope Of The Court’s Preliminary Injunction in Ms. L. v. ICE, No. 18-\n428 (S.D. Cal.) (Aug. 16, 2018) (ECF 192) (recognizing that class members may be \nrequired to choose whether to waive their own right not to be separated from their minor \nchild(ren) or to waive their child(ren)’s right under the Flores Settlement Agreement to be \nreleased, including the rights with regard to placement in the least restrictive setting \nappropriate to the minor’s age and special needs, and the right to release or placement in a \n“licensed program.”). \n8.  Ms. L counsel, M.M.M. counsel, or Dora counsel may identify class members who wish to \nwaive the procedures described herein and be promptly removed to their country of origin. \n                                                      \n3 This agreement does not impact the ability of Ms. L class members with final removal orders issued in Section 240 \nremoval proceedings, other than a reinstated order of removal, and who are not detained, to pursue individual appeals \nof such orders under existing law and subject to statutory time periods for challenging any such order. \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 220-1   Filed 09/12/18   PageID.3444   Page 6 of 7\nMs. L counsel, M.M.M. counsel, and Dora counsel will promptly develop a process for \nobtaining and documenting such a choice through a knowing and voluntary waiver. \nDefendants will not engage with class members on such matters, but will seek to effectuate \nsuch waiver decisions when communicated and documented by Ms. L counsel, M.M.M. \ncounsel, or Dora counsel. Class members may either pursue the relief described in this \nagreement or elect prompt removal, but may not pursue any other immigration- or asylum-\nrelated injunctive, declaratory, or equitable relief based on the allegations or claims made \nin any of the Ms. L, M.M.M., or Dora complaints filed in any court accruing as of the date \nthis plan is approved by the Court, including statutory claims. This agreement does not \naffect the right of Ms. L class members to seek reunification under the June 26, 2018 \npreliminary injunction in Ms. L. \nThe return of removed parents to the United States4 \nThe government does not intend to, nor does it agree to, return any removed parent to the United \nStates or to facilitate any return of such removed parents. The classes agree not to pursue any right \nor claim of removed parents to return to the United States other than as specifically set forth in this \nparagraph. Plaintiffs’ counsel may raise with the government individual cases in which plaintiffs’ \ncounsel believes the return of a particular removed Ms. L class member may be warranted. \nPlaintiffs’ counsel represent that they believe that such individual cases will be rare and unusual \nand that they have no basis for believing that such individual cases will be other than rare and \nunusual. Plaintiffs’ counsel agree to present any such cases, including all evidence they would like \nconsidered by the government within 30 days of the approval of this agreement. In light of \nplaintiffs’ counsel’s representation that such cases will be rare and unusual, Defendants agree to \nprovide a reply to any case presented by Plaintiffs within 30 days of receiving Plaintiffs’ request \nto consider the case. Except as specifically set forth herein, the classes agree that existing law, \nexisting procedures, and the Court-approved reunification plan address all interests that such \nparents or their children may have. \nWith respect to M.M.M. agreed class members who seek asylum and who have removed parents, \nthe government agrees not to oppose requests that the removed parent provide testimony or \nevidence telephonically or in writing in the child’s asylum or removal proceedings and that ICE \nattorneys appearing in immigration court (1) will not object to the admission of documentary \nevidence (such as photocopied, scanned, or faxed documents) provided by the removed parent on \nthe grounds that such documentary evidence does not bear an original signature or is not an original \ncopy (ICE reserves the right to object based on other grounds), and (2) will not object to telephonic \nparticipation by the parent in the M.M.M. agreed class member’s Section 240 removal proceedings \nprovided that the alien (and his or her legal representative, if applicable) make appropriate motions \nto the immigration judge to permit telephonic testimony in advance of any merits hearing, that the \nalien is responsible for providing accurate contact information to permit the immigration judge to \nmake contact with the parent, and that the parent’s unavailability and faulty connections or other \ntechnological impediments may not serve as the basis for delaying scheduled hearings. Class \n                                                      \n4 For this section of this agreement, the classes are the same as in footnote 1 above except that the requirements of \ncontinuous physical presence in the United States do not apply to this section of the agreement, since this section \naddresses removed parents. \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 220-1   Filed 09/12/18   PageID.3445   Page 7 of 7\nmembers, however, recognize that ICE has no control over the technology or logistics of the \nExecutive Office for Immigration Review. \n7 \n ",

Plaintiffs in this action are asylum seekers who, under Defendants' \"zero tolerance\" policy, \nwere forcibly separated from their children by government officials after they came to the United \nStates fleeing violence and persecution. During the time they were separated from their children \nand in many cases before they even knew where their children had been taken-Defendants pushed \nthem  through  screening  interviews  known  as  credible  fear  interviews.  These  credible  fear \ninterviews were their only opportunity to avoid expedited removal back to their home countries by \ndemonstrating that they have a credible fear of persecution on account of a protected ground. \n2.  At the time of their credible fear interviews, Plaintiffs were suffering from extreme trauma \ncaused by the Defendants forcibly separating them from their children. But Defendants pushed \nthem through their credible fear interviews under these circumstances, effectively depriving them \nof a meaningful opportunity to  apply  for  the  protection of asylum.  During their interviews, \nPlaintiffs were consumed by fear for their children, and could only think about where their children \nwere, whether they were in danger, whether they would see them again, and whether they might \nbe forced to leave the country without them. \n3.  Because of their trauma and other resulting  psychological conditions,  Plaintiffs  were \nunable to  fully  and competently participate in their credible fear  interviews.  They could not \narticulate their stories to the interviewing officers or even focus on the questions being asked. \nMany did not understand the questions or the purpose of the interviews. Others could not even \nremember what happened during their interviews. Instead, all they could think about was their \nchildren.  And  yet  Defendants  issued  negative  credible  fear  determinations  based  on  these \ninterviews, and now intend to summarily deport Plaintiffs from the United States. \n2 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 3 of 83\n4.  In this action, Plaintiffs challenge Defendants' systemic and unlawful policy of continuing \nto process parents quickly for removal and to reunify them with their children only \"for the purpose \nof removal\"  after  they  had  already  received  a  deportation  order.  Plaintiffs  also  challenge \nDefendants'  systemic  unlawful  policy  of pushing  traumatized  parents  through  credible  fear \ninterviews  before they were reunified with their children,  when they were not competent to \nparticipate  in  such  interviews,  and  without  any  accommodations  for  the  trauma  and  other \npsychological conditions caused by their separation from their children. Plaintiffs further challenge \nDefendants' systemic unlawful policy of relying on those defective credible fear interviews to \nissue expedited orders of removal, thereby depriving Plaintiffs of a meaningful opportunity to \napply  for  the  protection  of asylum.  These  policies  are  in  violation  of the  Immigration and \nNationality Act,  8 U.S.C.  § 1101  et seq.; the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C.  § 701  et seq.; the \nAdministrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq.; and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \nAmendment ofthe United States Constitution. \n5.  Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court declare Defendants' policies to be in violation \nof law and enjoin further application of these policies to Plaintiffs and other separated parents. \nPlaintiffs further request an Order compelling Defendants to vacate Plaintiffs' and other separated \nparents'  negative  credible fear  determinations  and  orders of removal,  and to  provide a new \nopportunity for credible fear interviews with reasonable accommodations to Plaintiffs and other \nparents who received negative credible fear determinations while they were separated from their \nchildren. \n6.  ThiscaseisrelatedtoMMM etal. v. Sessions, etal., No.1:18-cv-1835-PLF(D.D.C.filed \nAug.  3,  2018), which is  currently pending before this Court. MMM challenges Defendants' \npolicy of stripping children of their rights to seek asylum independently of their parents. This \n3 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 4 of 83\ncomplementary case is brought on behalf of parents who have received expedited removal orders \nas a result of Defendants' unlawful policies, as alleged more fully below. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n7.  This action arises under the United States Constitution; the Administrative Procedure Act, \n5 U.S.C. § 701  et seq.; the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101  et seq., and its \nimplementing regulations; and the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 701 et seq. \n8.

Plaintiffs  Fleeing  Violence  and  Death  Were  Forcibly  Separated  From  Their \nChildren and Severely Traumatized By That Separation. \n44.  Plaintiffs in this action are all asylum seekers who crossed the U.S. border between May \nand July 2018 fleeing multiple forms of persecution and violence, were forcibly separated from \ntheir children, received a credible fear interview (\"CFI\") during the time they were separated from \ntheir children, and received a negative credible fear determination. \n45.  All were suffering from trauma related to their separation from their children at the time of \ntheir interview, and had difficulty focusing on anything other than the whereabouts and well-being \nof their children. Most had fled at least in part to protect their children from harm in their home \n11 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 12 of 83\ncountries, and the experience of having their children taken away from them was consequently \npmiicularly traumatizing. \n46.  Many had symptoms of acute stress response and corresponding cognitive impairments, \nmaking them fundamentally unable to meaningfully participate in a credible fear interview. Decl. \nof Amy J.  Cohen, M.D.  (\"Cohen Decl.\"), attached hereto as  \"Exhibit A,\" at 1-3. Among the \nrepresentative sample of parents interviewed by Dr. Cohen, \"[e]very single parent described the \nmoment that their children were taken from them as the single most vividly horrifying experience \nof their lives: 'shattering', 'unbearable', 'a nightmare'.\" !d. at 1. \n47.  This  forcible  separation  that  lasted  for  months  caused  Plaintiffs  to  suffer  serious \npsychological and cognitive impairments that rendered them not competent to participate in their \ncredible fear interviews. !d. at 3. \n48.  Plaintiffs in this action were also  adversely impacted by unlawful federal  government \npolicies implementing the Attorney General's decision in Matter ofA  -B-, 27 I&N Dec. 316 (A.G. \n20 18), which seeks to unilaterally and unlawfully eliminate asylum for protected grounds relating \nto domestic violence and gang violence, and encourages asylum officers to make negative credible \nfear findings for individuals fleeing on account of this type of persecution. These policies made it \nespecially difficult for  Plaintiffs,  particularly in their traumatized condition,  to  articulate the \ngrounds on which they feared persecution in their home countries. See Grace v. Sessions, 1: 18-cv-\n01853-EGS (D.D.C. filed Aug. 7, 2018). They were further prejudiced by their inability to consult \nwith their children during their interviews. \n49.  Nonetheless,  Defendants  continued  to  conduct  their  credible  fear  interviews  without \nproviding any reasonable accommodations for their disabilities. \nPlaintiff \"Dora\" \n12 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 13 of 83\n50.  Dora fled Honduras after suffering extraordinary violence at the hands of her husband for \nyears, including violence .and threats of violence against her children. She was unable to obtain \nprotection from the police.  She came to the United States in June 2018 with her seven-year-old \nson, whom she brought with her in order to rescue him from the violence and trauma he had \nendured. \n51.  When she arrived at the border, Dora turned herself over willingly to immigration agents, \ntelling them that she is here to seek asylum. When she learned that they might take her child \naway, she begged and pleaded with them not to separate them, attempting to explaii1 that her son \nhad been through many horrible experiences and needed to be with her. Ignoring her pleas, CBP \nofficials forcibly separated her from him, and as he was being take'n away, one CBP official told \nher that she deserved to lose her child and would not see him again until he is eighteen years old. \n52.  Dora experienced extreme mental and emotional distress as a result of being separated \nfrom her son. She was intensely anxious and afraid for him, and worried that he was being \nfmiher traumatized by their separation from each other. \n53.  Dora was unable to speak to her son for almost two weeks. When they finally did speak, \nit was for a very brief phone call, in which he told her that an official threatened to hit with a belt \nany children who cried, and that he was being very good and not crying so that he could avoid \nbeing hit. Dora was incredibly distressed by this, particularly given her son's past experiences of \nviolence. \n54.  Dora's credible fear interview took place very shortly after she had spoken to her son for \nthe first time. She was still profoundly distressed by the phone call and weeping, and she could \nnot hear or understand what the interviewer was asking her. She expressed her confusion to the \ninterviewer multiple times. She could not focus and felt lightheaded throughout the interview, \n13 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 14 of 83\nand could not think of anything other than her son. \n55.  A psychiatrist who evaluated Dora concluded that she was suffering from severe acute \nstress response at the time of her interview and was not competent to participate in such an \ninterview. \n56.  Dora received a negative credible fear determination, which was affirmed by an \nimmigration judge. She was recently reunited with her son and has been released on an order of \nsupervision. She is required to check in regularly with ICE and is subject to deportation at any \ntime. \nPlaintiff \"Alma\" \n57.  Alma fled Honduras with her two boys, aged seven and nine, because of violence and \npersecution she and her family members endured. She arrived in the United States in June 2018. \nThe next morning, she was taken to court for prosecution for illegal entry. When she returned to \nthe CBP facility, her children had disappeared. She began to inquire about her children's location \nand a CBP officer told her she would not get her children back, because they would stay in the \nUnited States while she would be deported. After twenty-eight days of no information about her \nchildren's whereabouts or wellbeing, a social worker helped her have a one-minute call with her \nnine-year-old, who asked her when they would be together and stated he wanted to leave the \nfacility. \n58.  At the time of her credible fear interview, Alma was separated from her children and \nunable to focus on anything other than that separation. She was later diagnosed with post \ntraumatic stress disorder (\"PTSD\") because of this separation, with strong indications that she \nwas suffering from acute, debilitating trauma at the time of her interview. Alma reported \nsymptoms including re-experiencing the trauma of separation, avoidance, alterations in mood \n14 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 15 of 83\nand cognition, hyperarousal, and dissociation. She still experiences an accelerated heartrate and \nheadache when she is reminded of the experience of losing her children, and experiences \nongoing, significant stress about the potential of being separated from her children again. \n59.  Alma received a negative credible fear determination, which was affirmed by an \nimmigration judge. \n60.  Alma was recently reunited with her children, and was released on an order of \nsupervision. She is required to check in regularly with ICE and is subject to deportation at any \ntime. \nPlaintiff \"Beatriz\" \n61.  Beatriz fled El Salvador with her nine-year-old daughter to escape persecution by the \nSalvadoran military and by her abusive husband and his gang. When she arrived in the United \nStates in May 2018, Defendants immediately separated Beatriz from her daughter. After \nattending a hearing, Beatriz returned to find her daughter had disappeared. She did not eat for \nthree days after the disappearance, lost her will to do anything, and had difficulty focusing. \n62.  Beatriz had fled El Salvador in part because of her husband's abuse of her daughter, and \nshe had vowed to never allow anyone to harm her again, but was now powerless to protect her. \nCBP officials would not tell her where her daughter was. Beatriz vividly imagined what her \ndaughter was going through by extrapolating from the harsh conditions of her own confinement, \nand worried constantly. \n63.  At the time of her credible fear interview, Beatriz had been separated from her daughter \nfor a month. Experiencing severe emotional distress and trauma because of this forced \nseparation, she was not articulate during the interview. The only facts that were fresh in her mind \n15 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 16 of 83\n·were associated with her daughter, namely that her husband repeatedly beat the girl and that she . \nwas now lost. She had extreme difficulty focusing on or recalling any other aspects of her story. \n64.  Despite Beatriz's symptoms of trauma, the asylum officer repeatedly interrupted her \nduring the interview, and compelled her to answer all of her questions with either \"yes\" or \"no.\" \nDespite her best effort, the disastrous circumstances of the interview and her disabling and all \nconsuming focus on her child resulted in an incomplete record. She received a negative credible \nfear determination, which was affirmed by an immigration judge. \n65.  Beatriz was recently reunited with her child and is currently detained with her at Dilley. \nPlaintiff \"Carla\" \n66.  Carla fled Honduras with her eight-year-old son to escape persecution by her ex-partner \non the basis of her race, religion, and other protected grounds. Her ex-partner repeatedly beat \nher, raped her, and threatened her son. She attempted to flee and hide from him twice, but both \ntimes he was able to find her. She fears for her life and her son's life if they return to Honduras. \nWhen she arrived in the United States in May 2018, Defendants took her son away from her, and \nshe remained separated from him for months. \n67.  At the time of her credible fear interview, Carla had not seen her son for weeks, and was \nexperiencing severe distress at her separation from him. During the interview, she felt \ncompletely overwhelmed and could not focus on the questions being asked or think clearly. She \nexpressed her desire to see her son and speak with him. The asylum officer stated that she would \nappear before a judge, and if the judge deported her, her son would stay in the United States \nwithout her and she would not see him again. She thought the officer was trying to intimidate \nher, and she was in fact terrified during the interview. She received a negative credible fear \ndetermination, which was affirmed by an immigration judge. \n16 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 17 of 83\n68.  Carla was recently reunified with her child and is currently detained at Dilley. \nPlaintiff \"Esperanza\" \n69.  Esperanza fled Guatemala with her·seven-year-old son because her husband, an initiate of \nMS-13, \"gifted\" her to a gang leader to be a sex slave. She has been systematically raped in front \nof her three children, physically and emotionally abused, has received death threats and threats to \nher children's lives, and has been prevented from practicing her religion. She risks being killed if \nshe is retuned to Guatemala. When Esperanza arrived in the United States in May 2018, \nDefendants immediately took her then six-year-old son away from her. \n70.  At the time of her credible fear interview, Esperanza had no information about her son's \nwhereabouts, other than having been told that he \"belonged to the government now.\" As a result, \nshe could not fully present the basis for her fear of persecution. She felt an overwhelming sense \nof fear and dread, and her primary focus during the interview was recurring thoughts of terror \nthat she would lose her son. Because of her inability to communicate the basis of her fear during \nher interview, she received a negative credible fear finding, which was affirmed by an \nimmigration judge. \n71.  Esperanza was recently reunited with her child and is currently detained at Dilley. \nPlaintiff \"Fany\" \n72.  Farry fled Honduras with her minor daughter due to racially-motivated death threats from \nher husband, who would savagely beat and threaten to rape their daughter, and due to gang \nviolence targeting her and her family members. Upon arrival in the United States in May 2018, \nFarry was separated from her daughter. \n73.  At the time ofher credible fear interview, Farry had been separated from her child for \nweeks. She was distressed and had great difficulty responding to questions during the interview. \n17 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 18 of 83\nShe was unfocused, confused, and flustered, and her thoughts kept turning towards her missing \ndaughter. She also was in medical distress due to injuries caused by rape. The interpreter kept, \ninterrupting her and telling her to pause, and she would forget what she was trying to say or what \nthe question was about. She could only think about her daughter and could not focus on herself \nor what she had endured in Honduras. As a result of her disability, she provided erroneous and \nextremely truncated answers in the interview. She received a negative credible fear \ndetermination, which was affirmed by an immigration judge. \n74.  Fany was recently reunited with her child, and is currently detained at Dilley. \nPlaintiff \"Gina\" \n75.  Gina fled El Salvador with her ten-year-old son to escape death threats and extortion \nfrom MS-13, which was trying to drug and recruit her son, and to escape attacks and death \nthreats from her former partner, an MS-13 associate who prevented her from practicing her faith. \nShe knows she will be killed if she returns to El Salvador. She was separated from her son about \na day after arriving in the United States in May 2018. \n76.  The last time she saw her son, he was standing in what she thought looked like a dog \ncage. He was crying out for her and was suffering from untreated and persistent nosebleeds. The \nguard would not let her comfort him or talk to him, and she was whisked away to another \nfacility. \n77.  Before her credible fear interview, an immigration official told Gina that if she continued \nto pursue her asylum claim, she would not see her son again. She also saw on television that if \nchildren were not claimed after a certain time, they can be put up for adoption. \n78.  At the time of her credible fear interview, Gina had had no contact with her son for \ntwenty-one days and did not know where he was located. She was experiencing extreme \n18 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 19 of 83\ndepression, stress, and anxiety. All she wanted to do was sleep so that she would not have to \nthink about her son and suffer the intense pain that came with those thoughts. She had stopped \neating, and was completely consumed by worry. Her trauma at being separated from her son was \nso great that she could not concentrate on her interview and failed, due to this disability, to \narticulate the dire situation she faced if she were forced to return to El Salvador. \n79.  Though the asylum officer asked if she wanted more information about her child's \nlocation, the officer did not provide any information or address Gina's worry. Gina felt she could \nnot trust the officer and she considered simply asking to be depmied, so she could be reunited \nwith her son and look after his health and safety again. She received a negative credible fear \ndetermination, which was affirmed by an immigration judge. \n80.  Gina was recently reunited with her son and is currently detained at Dilley. \nPlaintiff \"Helena\" \n81.  Helena fled Honduras with her sixteen-year-old son due to death threats she received on \naccount of multiple protected grounds. She would suffer serious harm if she was returned to \nHonduras; she fears she would be murdered like her family members and that the police will not \nprotect her. When she arrived in the United States in June 2018, immigration authorities \nimmediately separated her from her son. \n82.  She did not sleep the entire night, and worried her son had been left in the \"freezer\" \nwhere they had been separated. A few days before her interview, a man in the cell just next to \nher who had been separated from his daughter hung himself. Other mothers in Helena's cell were \nsaying the government would send children far away and they would never see them again, and \nshe even heard rumors that children would be sold for organ donations. \n19 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 20 of 83\n83.  At the time of her credible fear interview, just fourteeR days after the separation, Helena \nhad not spoken with her son at all and had no idea where he was located. She had trouble \nconcentrating, communicating, and thinking clearly, as she could only think about the location \nand well-being of her son. The interview seemed to Helena to last just minutes, though the \nofficer recorded a duration of more than an hour. She was not in her right mind. After the \ninterview she kept thinking of her son, and would wake up at night and cry. She received a \nnegative credible fear determination, which was affirmed by an immigration judge. \n84.  Helena was recently reunited with her son and is currently detained at Dilley. \nPlaintiff \"Isidra\" \n85.  Isidra fled Honduras with her fourteen-year-old daughter to escape her partner, who \nfalsely imprisoned them, threatened to kill them, and battered them on the basis oflsidra's \npolitical views and Christian faith. Based on.the past failures of police to protect her, Isidra is \nafraid of returning to Honduras. A day after she arrived in the United States, CBP officials \nseparated Isidra from her daughter. Isidra fell into a depression. She lost her appetite and cried \nconstantly. \n86.  Isidra's credible fear interview took place while she was still separated from her \ndaughter. During her credible fear interview, she could not explain the circumstances under \nwhich she fled Honduras because she was completely overcome with concern for the safety and \nwellbeing ofher daughter. For example, when asked if she was afraid to go back to Honduras or \nwould prefer to return there, she only stated that she wanted to be with her daughter and for her \ndaughter to have a better life. She received a negative credible fear determination, which was \naffirmed by an immigration judge. \n87.  She was recently reunited with her daughter and is currently detained at Dilley. \n20 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 21 of 83\nPlaintiff \"Jenifer\" \n88.  Jenifer fled Honduras with her 10-year-old son and 7-year-old daughter after having \nsuffered persecution on account of multiple protected grounds. Shortly after arriving in the \nUnited States in May 2018, Jenifer was forcibly separated from her children and detained by \nCBP. She was initially taken to the Pearsall Detention Center, where the guards forced her to \nstrip naked and threatened to cut off all of her hair. \n89.  Jenifer experienced extreme mental and emotional distress as a result of being separated \nfrom her children. She was particularly afraid for her seven-year old daughter, who had \npreviously been molested in Honduras, given Jenifer's own experience of humiliation at the \nhands of the guards at the Pearsall Detention Center. She was terrified that her daughter would \nagain be molested and knew that her daughter was not comfortable being alone with strangers \nafter what had happened to her in Honduras. \n90.  At the time of her credible fear interview, Jenifer had not been told where her children \nwere and was not sure if she was ever going to see them again. She was panicked and \ntraumatized during the interview and could not stop worrying about her children, making it \nimpossible to prepare for the interview or remember everything she needed to convey to the \nasylum officer. As a result, Jenifer was unable to communicate or to provide meaningful answers \nduring her credible fear interview. She received a negative credible fear determination, which \nwas affirmed by an immigration judge. \n91.  J enifer has recently been reunified with her children and is currently detained at Dilley. \nPlaintiff \"Kara\" \n92.  Kara fled Honduras with her thi1ieen-year-old daughter due to persecution on account of \nher political opinion. When she arrived in the United States in May 2018, her daughter was taken \n21 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 22 of 83\nfrom her. It was the first time in their lives that they had been separated. Kara continually asked \nofficers for any piece of information regarding her daughter, where she was, how she was doing, \nand when would she be able to see her. The officers would answer that it was not their problem \nand that theydid not care. \n93.  Kara was terrified for her daughter after being separated from her. She became so \ndistraught that she had to be given medication-antidepressants and sleeping pills-to treat the \ndepression she suffered as a result of having been separated from her daughter. The medication \ndid not work and actually made her feel worse. Kara suffered side effects from the medications. \n94.  At the time of her credible fear interview, Kara did not know where her daughter was \nbeing held and kept asking for her daughter during the interview. She was depressed, and the \nmedication made her dizzy and confused, so she could not understand the questions. She later \nstated that she did not remember anything she was asked nor the responses she gave. She \nreceived a negative credible fear determination, which was affirmed by an immigration judge. \n95.  Kara was recently reunited with her daughter and is currently detained at Dilley. \nPlaintiff \"Linda\" \n96.  Linda fled Honduras with her seven-year-old son because of persecution on account of \nher political opinion. Shortly after they arrived in the United States in May 2018, Linda's son \nwas taken away from her by CBP officials. They did not tell her where her son would be taken or \nwhat the conditions of his detention would be. \n97.  As a result of her separation from her child, Linda suffered great fear and anxiety and \nwas terrified to the point of becoming physically ill. During the first week of their separation, \nLinda barely ate, drank, or slept. She had severe headaches. During the short periods of time that \nshe did sleep, she had nightmares involving her son. Linda asked officials about her son \n22 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 23 of 83\nrepeatedly. She was told that she would not get him back and that the U.S. government was \ngoing to place him with people who could not have children. Linda was afraid that she would \nnever see her son again. She was able to speak briefly to her son only four times over the course \nof two months. \n98.  At the time of her credible fear interview, Linda was separated from her child and was \ncontinuing to suffer severe emotional trauma as a result of that separation. She could not \nconcentrate or focus and could not think of anything besides her son. Linda received a negative \ncredible fear determination, which was affirmed by an immigration judge. \n99.  Linda was recently reunified with her son and is currently detained at Dilley. \nPlaintiff \"Mindy\" \n100.  Mindy fled Honduras with her sixteen-year-old son because of persecution on account of \nher religious beliefs and other protected grounds. Mindy and her son were apprehended by CBP \nand initially detained together. A few days later, officials told Mindy that her son would be taken \nfrom her, but did not tell her where he would be taken, how long they would be separated, or the \nconditions of his detention. \n101.  Mindy and her son were given only a few minutes to speak before he was taken away. \nAfter her son was taken away from her, Mindy was placed in handcuffs and ankle cuffs. Officials \nasked her if she wanted to commit suicide. Because her blood pressure was very high, she was \ngiven medication of an unknown type. For four days, she was kept in the \"hielera\" (ice box), a \nfreezing holding facility CBP uses at the border. \n23 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 24 of 83\n102.  Mindy suffered tremendous fear and anxiety because ofher separation from her son.  She \ndid not know whether she would ever see her son again, and officials would not inform her about \nhis whereabouts or his condition. At the time of her credible fear interview, she was separated \nfrom her son and did not know whether or when they would be reunited. She was so distracted \nand distraught about being separated from her son that she could not think straight or focus on \nthe questions she was being asked. She received a negative credible fear determination, which \nwas affirmed by an immigration judge. \n103.  Mindy was recently reunited with her son and is currently detained at Dilley. \nPlaintiff \"Nora\" \n104.  Nora fled El Salvador with her six-year-old daughter because of persecution on account \nof a protected ground. When she arrived in the United States in May 2018, she and her daughter \nwere apprehended by CBP officials and were initially detained together in the hielera. Shortly \nthereafter, Nora and her daughter were forcibly separated. Her daughter cried and begged to stay \nwith Nora, who could do nothing as the CBP officials put her in handcuffs and took her daughter \naway. \n105.  Nora was inconsolable upon being separated from her daughter, who had already suffered \ntrauma in El Salvador after her father's murder at the hands ofMS-13. While in detention, Nora \nrepeatedly asked officers about her daughter and begged for a chance to speak with her. The \nofficers told her that no one knew where her daughter was taken, leaving Nora so hopeless and \ndepressed that she considered suicide. She replayed in her head, over and over again, the moment \nshe and her daughter were separated. \n106.  At the time of her credible fear interview, Nora was living in tremendous fear, anxiety, \nand uncertainty. She was not sure if her-daughter was safe, or if she would ever see her again. \n24 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 25 of 83\nHer exhaustion and trauma at being separated from her daughter prevented her from fully \narticulating the basis of her claim for asylum. \n107.  Nora was recently reunified with her daughter and is currently detained at Dilley. \nPlaintiff \"Orelia\" \n108.  Orelia fled Honduras with her thirteen-year-old son because of persecution on account of \nmultiple protected grounds. She was separated from her son shortly after her arrival in the United \nStates in May 2018. She was extremely anxious and worried about her son, and was only able to \nspeak with him briefly on two occasions. \n109.  Immediately before her credible fear interview, which took place while she was separated \nfrom her son, an officer told Orelia that her son was placed with another family, which Orelia \nthought meant that he had been adopted. This exacerbated her already severe anxiety and trauma. \nFrom that point on, Orelia found it difficult to function and was barely able to sleep or eat. \n110.  During the interview, Orelia became extremely nervous. She was not able to present her \nclaim due to the trauma of being separated from her child and the overwhelming fear she felt not \nknowing if her child was safe or if she would ever see him again. She was unable to concentrate \nand therefore could not discuss important aspects of her claim. She could only think about her \nchild and was constantly distracted, not knowing if he was alive or dead. Her interview clearly \ndemonstrates that her thoughts were only with her child. Throughout the interview, she spoke \nabout her son's safety and asked about his current status instead of focusing on her own asylum \nclaim. She received a negative credible fear determination, which was upheld by an immigration \njudge. \n111.  Orelia and her son were recently reunited, and she is currently detained at Dilley. \nPlaintiff \"Patricia\" \n25 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 26 of 83\n112.  Patricia fled El Salvador with her fourteen-year-old son because of persecution on \naccount of her political opinion, sexual orientation, and membership in a protected social group. \nShe was separated from her son shortly after arriving in the United States. \n113.  For 25 days, Patricia did not know her son's whereabouts. She was so worried and scared \nfor her son that she fell violently ill. Despite Patricia's multiple attempts to discover her son's \nlocation, she was not provided any information about him. \n114.  At the time of her credible fear interview, Patricia was under extreme emotional distress \ndue to her separation from her son and her fear that she would never see him again. She was \nphysically ill, so she was unable to prepare for the interview and unable to focus on the questions \nduring the interview. As a result, she misunderstood questions and was unable to fully explain \nher case. She received a negative credible fear determination, which an immigration judge \naffirmed. \n115.  Patricia was recently reunited with her son and is currently detained at Dilley. \nPlaintiff \"Quela\" \n116.  Quela fled Guatemala with her seventeen-year-old son because of persecution on account \nof her membership in multiple protected groups. Shortly after her arrival in the United States, she \nwas separated from her son without explanation. \n117.  While detained, guards treated Quela badly, insulted her, and repeatedly told her she \nwould never see her son again because they were going to use him \"for a war [they] were \nfighting.\" Quela was not told where her son was or if she would ever see him again. She was \nconstantly depressed and crying during the long period of separation from her son. \n118.  At the time ofher CFI, Quela was extremely distressed. She could not focus on the \nquestions being asked of her, and she was visibly upset and crying for the duration ofthe \n26 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 27 of 83\ninterview. She was singularly focused on the hope of reuniting with her son and believed that the \nfaster she could complete the interviews and other procedures, the sooner she might be reunited \nwith him. She received a negative credible fear determination, which was affirmed by an \nimmigration judge. \n119.  Quela was recently reunified with her son and is curr-ently detained at Dilley. \nPlaintiff \"Rita\" \n120.  Rita fled Guatemala with her thirteen-year-old son to escape persecution on the basis of \nher race, membership in a particular social group, and political opinion. She fears return to \nGuatemala because she and her entire home town have been singled out and attacked by the \ngovernment for their activism and political protest and for other reasons. When she arrived in the \nUnited States in May 2018, officers immediately separated her from her son. \n121.  When Rita realized her son was missing, she couldn't stop crying. She had never been \nseparated from him before. Officers said they did not know where her son had been taken, and \nthat it was not their problem and they did not care. After fifteen days, she was finally able to \nspeak with him for very short periods of time on the phone. She was in such anguish that she \nstopped eating, suffered from headaches, and suffered from crippling feelings of guilt that she \ncould not ensure her son's safety. \n122.  At the time of Rita's CFI, she was in extreme anguish and felt as though she was losing \nher mind. She just wanted to have her son by her side again. She could not understand the \nquestions and could not focus on the interview. This was compounded by the fact that the \ninterpreter did not speak the same indigenous dialect as hers. She received a negative credible \nfear determination, which was upheld by an immigration judge. \n123.  Rita was recently reunited with her child and is currently detained at Dilley. \n27 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 28 of 83\nPlaintiff \"Sylvia\" \n124.  Sylvia fled Guatemala with her nine-year-old daughter because of persecution on account \nof multiple protected grounds. The day after she arrived in the United States, officers separated \nher from her daughter. Because Sylvia's daughter had been assaulted when she was six, Sylvia \nfeared it could happen again if they were separated. Sylvia suffered from nightmares where she \nvividly saw her daughter being assaulted, and she would wake up screaming and crying. \n125.  At the time of her CFI, Sylvia had been separated from her daughter for eighteen days. \nSylvia's fear and anxiety about her daughter were crippling, and it was impossible for her to \nfocus on and articulate critical aspects of her claims during the interview. She received a \nnegative credible fear determination, which was affirmed by an immigration judge. \n126.  Sylvia was recently reunited with her daughter and is currently detained at Dilley. \nPlaintiff \"Tania\" \n127.  Tania fled Guatemala with her six-year-old son because of severe persecution on account \nof multiple protected grounds. She is terrified that she will be forcibly returned to Guatemala. \nShortly after her arrival in the United States in May, 2018, officers separated her from her son. \nShe worried about her son constantly, and the separation heightened and compounded the trauma \nshe was already experiencing from her persecution in Guatemala. \n128.  At the time of her CFI, Tania was extremely distressed, scared, and confused because of \nher separation from her child. As a result, she was unable to provide a narrative of her trauma \nand persecution in Guatemala. The asylum officer used a fast pace and either failed to recognize \nor ignored her emotional exhaustion, for example by failing to follow up when Tania was non \nresponsive. She clearly had trouble understanding the interview questions. \n28 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 29 of 83\n129.  Towards the end of the interview, Tania began pleading for information about her son, \nasking where she could call her son, and stating she was not sure if he was doing well and that \nshe was sure he was crying for her. The asylum officer dismissed these questions, stating \"I do \nnot work here and am not involved in that.\" She received a negative credible fear determination, \nwhich was affirmed by an immigration judge. \n130.  Tania was recently reunited with her son and is currently detained at Dilley. \nPlaintiff \"Ula\" \n131.  Ula fled Honduras with her eight-year-old daughter to escape past persecution, including \ndeath threats, attempted murder, and the actual murder of her mother in front of her eyes, \npersecution to which she was subjected on the basis of multiple protected grounds. When she \nfirst arrived in the United States with her daughter, they were placed in the hielera together. \nShortly thereafter, an officer carne in and said he was going to take her daughter to another room \nuntil the next morning. The next morning, she began asking multiple officials about her \ndaughter, but no one would give her any information about her whereabouts. She became \nextremely anxious and upset. She could not sleep, and she cried every day. She could barely eat. \nShe kept asking officer after officer about her daughter, but nobody would give her any \ninformation. \n132.  At the time of her credible fear interview, Ula was separated from her daughter and was \nextremely anxious and traumatized by that separation. The asylum officer asked her questions \nabout her child at the beginning of the interview, which caused Ula to be unable to think about \nanything else over the course of the entire interview. She received a negative credible fear \ndetermination, which was upheld by the immigration judge. \n133.  Ula was recently reunited with her daughter and is currently detained at Dilley. \n29 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 30 of 83\nPlaintiff \"Victoria\" \n134.  Victoria fled Guatemala with her eight-year-old son to escape rape and incest, as well as \npersecution on the basis of her religious beliefs. She is terrified at the idea of being returned to \nGuatemala. When she was twelve years old, she was raped repeatedly by her uncle and gave \nbirth to a daughter. While she was recovering from the birth, her daughter was forcibly taken \naway from her and given to another family without her consent. She spent years trying to locate \nher daughter, and when she eventually found her, was barely allowed to see her by her adoptive \nmother. She has suffered repeated and multiple forms of persecution on the basis of her status as \na rape and incest victim and other protected grounds. \n135.  In light of her history, Victoria was especially and distinctly traumatized when, within \ndays of arriving in the United States in June 2018, her son was forcibly taken away from her. The \nguards told her she would not see her son again, and that this was why she should not have \ncrossed the border. \n136.  As a result of her separation from her son, she experienced sleeplessness, nightmares \nwhen she did sleep, memory deficiencies, inability to concentrate, and other symptoms of acute \ntrauma. She was diagnosed with PTSD on August 7, 2018 by a clinical psychologist, who found \nthat the second instance of child disappearance build upon and heightened the trauma she had \npreviously experienced with the first separation. \n137.  At the time ofher CFI, she was separated from her son and completely incapable of \ntestifying on her own behalf. She had no understanding of the process and could not focus on the \nquestions she was being asked or bring to mind the answers to those questions. She received a \nnegative credible fear determination, which was upheld by an immigration judge. \n13 8.  Victoria was recently reunified with her son and is detained at Dilley. \n30 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 31 of 83\nPlaintiff \"Wilma\" \n139.  Wilma fled Honduras with her ten-year-old son to escape sexual violence and assault and \ndeath threats on account of a protected ground. When Wilma arrived in the United States in June \n2018, she successfully sought out CBP officials, believing they would assist her and her son \nbecause they were seeking asylum. \n140.  She held her son's hand the entire time they were transported to the hielera because she \ndid not want to lose him. Eventually they were moved to a facility with cells separated by chain \nlinked fencing that resembled cages. The women were made to stand on one side and children on \nthe other, but it was too far to see if her son was on the other side. At some point in the next day, \nCBP officials had the mothers line up and had the children walk past in a line and identify their \nmothers. After spending ten minutes with her son, they were separated again. Not all the children \ncould find their mothers. Wilma was then taken to criminal court for prosecution for illegal \nentry, and when she returned, the children were gone. The initial separation, brief reunion, and \nre-separation, along with her complete lack of information about her child's whereabouts made \nher desperate. She feared her son would be returned to Honduras without her. And even when \nshe spoke with her son on the phone ten days later, she felt worse, because her son didn't know \nwhere he was, and he was crying for the entire duration of the phone call. \n141.  At the time of Wilma's credible fear interview, she was separated from her son and did \nnot know if she would see him again. As the interview progressed from biographical and \nstraight-forward questions to more complex questions about the reasons for her flight from \nHonduras, Wilma felt more and more worried about the fate and whereabouts of her son. She felt \nshe was in a fog and could not think or answer clearly. She wanted the interview to end so she \n31 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 32 of 83\ncould see her son again, and at the conclusion of the interview asked if the asylum officer could \ntell her the location of her son. Wilma received a negative credible fear determination. \n142.  Wilma was recently reunified with her child and is currently detained at Dilley. \nPlaintiff \"Xiomara\" \n143.  Xiomara fled Honduras with her two daughters, aged fourteen and six, because of \nmultiple forms of persecution on account of protected grounds, including death threats against \nher and her daughter for not paying money to the gangs. She fears this persecution will continue \nif she is forced to return to Honduras, and that the authorities cannot or will not protect her. \nWhen she arrived in the United States in May 2018, she spent a night in the hielera with her two \ndaughters. The next day, CBP officials took her daughters away with no notice. \n144.  In the following days and weeks, Xiomara could not function mentally or emotionally, \nfelt extreme sadness and anxiety, could not sleep properly, and felt pains in her chest. When \nXiomara was at the Port Isabel Detention Center, facility staff yelled at her and at the other \nwomen that they would be deported soon and would not see their children. \n145.  Xiomara was especially susceptible to manipulation of her relationship with her children, \nbecause this was a pattern used by gang members in Honduras. For example, after Xiomara's \ndaughter got out of school one day, a gang member pointed a gun at the girl's head and told her \nthat if she did not pay the gang a \"business tax,\" the girl would become a gang member as \npayment. Once Xiomara had her children grabbed from her in detention, she thought about them \nconstantly, and submitted multiple paper requests every week asking for information about their \nwhereabouts and circumstances. \n146.  At the time ofXiomara's credible fear interview, she could not discuss crucial aspects of \nher claim because of her singular focus on being reunited with her daughter and son. The asylum \n32 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 33 of 83\nofficer was brusque and would not allow her to finish her statements or to elaborate. Under the \nextreme distress of separation from her children, Xiomara could not collect herself to focus on \nthe questions fully. She received a negative credible fear determination, which was upheld by an \nimmigration judge. \n147.  Xiomara was recently reunited with her children and is currently detained at Dilley. \nPlaintiff \"Yadira\" \n148.  Yadira left Guatemala with her nine-year-old son to escape threats from the Mendoza \ndrug cartel after her boyfriend and uncle were murdered. She fears the cartel will kill her and her \nson if they return, because she disobeyed their orders and because the cartel members visited her \nhome multiple times to ask for them. Shortly after arriving in the United States in May 2018, she \nwas forcibly separated from her son. \n149.  At the time ofYadira's credible fear interview, she did not know where her son was, and \nwhether he was safe. She was under extreme pressure and stress, and believed she might never \nsee him again. As a result, she could not share her full story, and she had trouble thinking clearly. \nShe received a negative credible fear determination, which was upheld by the immigration judge. \n150.  She was recently reunited with her son and is currently detained at Dilley. \nPlaintiff \"Zandra\" \n151.  Zandra left Honduras with her ten-year-old daughter to flee persecution on account of \nmultiple protected grounds. A few days after arriving in the United States in June 2018, CBP \nofficers took away her then nine-year-old daughter, stating that she would see her again in a few \ndays. Each day they told her she would see her daughter soon, creating a torturous cycle of belief \nthat reunification was near, only to have that dream shattered. Zandra could not and still cannot \n33 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 34 of 83\nsleep. She had constant headaches and found herself sobbing at random moments. She felt like \nshe was in a horrible movie. \n152.  At her credible fear interview, Zandra spoke with a hostile asylum officer who told her \nnot to talk and to answer questions with \"yes\" or \"no,\" or in short sentences. She was extremely \ndisoriented and scared that she would be deported without her daughter and that they would \nnever meet again. Zandra received a negative credible fear determination, which was affirmed by \nan immigration judge. \n153.  Zandra has recently been reunited with her daughter and is currently detained at Dilley. \nPlaintiff \"Alex\" \n154.  Alex left Honduras with his six-year-old son fleeing threats of gang violence and \npersecution. One day after arriving in the United States in May 2018, he was separated from his \nson. Alex was crushed by thoughts of self-reproach, believing that he had failed to protect his \nson. He found himself sobbing at night, lost his appetite, and experienced painful stomach aches. \nHe felt emotionally consumed and physically exhausted. He felt like he was going to die. \n155.  At the time ofhis credible fear interview, Alex was in physical pain because ofthe \ntrauma of being separated from his son. He did not understand many of the questions asked, \ncould not concentrate, could not share his story, and could only think about his son and whether \nthey would ever see each other again. He received a negative credible fear determination, which \nwas upheld by an immigration judge. \n156.  Alex was recently reunited with his son and is currently detained at Karnes. \nPlaintiff \"Benjamin\" \n157.  Benjamin left Guatemala with his fourteen-year-old son because of gang violence and \nthreats targeted at him and his family. He suffers from insomnia and fears being killed, robbed, \n34 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 35 of 83\nand threatened if he is returned to Guatemala. About two days after arriving in the United States, \nCBP officials separated him from his son. \n158.  At the time of his credible fear interview, Benjamin felt extremely worried and distressed \nabout his son. He had not been eating or sleeping, was suffering from a physical injury, and was \nhaving a hard time communicating or articulating the basis for his fear of return. He received a \nnegative credible fear determination, which was upheld by an immigration judge. \n159.  Benjamin was recently reunited with his son and is currently detained at Karnes. \nPlaintiff \"Carlos\" \n160.  Carlos fled Honduras with his eight-year-old son to escape violence and death threats \nfrom gang members who murdered his friend in front of him then shot at and nearly killed him, \nas well as from police persecution on the basis of multiple protected grounds. When he arrived in \nthe United States, Carlos sought out Border Patrol in order to seek asylum. Carlos and his son \nwere placed in the hielera. Shortly thereafter, an officer called his son's name. Carlos asked \nwhere they were taking him and the officer said she did not know. Carlos could not get any \ninformation about his son. A day later, he was transferred to another detention center. He was \nextremely nervous and upset by his separation from his son, and had difficulty eating or sleeping. \n161.  At the time of his CFI, Carlos had been separated from his son for over a month. The \nguard that took him to his CFI observed that Carlos was not doing well, and Carlos told the \nguard he felt like a crazy person. He was pale, and visibly distressed. He had been thinking about \nhis son constantly, and he continued to think obsessively about his son during the interview. The \nasylum officer seemed intimidating and hostile, and forced Carlos to just answer \"yes\" or \"no.\" \nCarlos received a negative credible fear determination. Immigration officials told him that he \nwould be reunited with his son more quickly if he did not go to an immigration judge for review \n35 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 36 of 83\nof his case. Because he was desperate to be together with his son at any cost, he did not appeal \nhis case, despite the fact that, if returned to Honduras, he fears severe persecution and possibly \ndeath on account of a protected ground. \n162.  Carlos was recently reunited with his son and is currently detained at Karnes. \n*  *  * \n163.  In sum, each of the Plaintiffs experienced severe trauma and other psychological \n· conditions because of Defendants' policy of forcibly separating them from their children, \ncontinuing to process them for removal while they were traumatized by that separation, and \nforcing them to undergo credible fear interviews while they were too traumatized to competently \ntestify on their own behalf. \nII.  The  Trauma  Experienced  By  Parents  Separated  From  Their  Children  Was \nPredictable, Is Well-Documented, and Impacted Their Ability to Meaningfully \nParticipate in Credible Fear Interviews. \n164.  It is widely known that asylum seekers at the border already experience a high prevalence \nof trauma and psychological distress due to factors such as pre-migration exposure to violence, \ntorture, and life-threatening travel conditions.1 A study focusing on Central American Migrants \n1 See generally Giulia Turrini et al., Common Mental Disorders in Asylum Seekers and Refugees: \nUmbrella Review ofP  revalence and Intervention Studies, 11 Int'l J. Ment. Health Syst. (2017) \n(winnowing a total of 535 studies to 27 relevant systematic reviews, 13 of which reported data \non the prevalence of trauma-related symptoms or conditions like PTSD, depression, and \nanxiety); K. Robjant, R. Hassan & C. Katona, Mental Health Implications ofD  etaining Asylum \nSeekers: Systematic Review, 194 Br. J. Psychiatry 306-312 (2009) (compiling data across 10 \nstudies and 877 detained asylum seekers to find high levels of mental health problems such as \nanxiety at 77%, depression at 59%-100%, and PTSD at 27%-50%); I. Bronstein & P. \nMontgomery, Psychological Distress in Refugee Children: A Systematic Review, 14 Clin. Child \nFam. Psychol. Rev. 44-56 (2011) (compiled data from 22 studies covering 3003 refugee children \nand adolescents under the age of 25 resettled in Western countries and found a PTSD range of 19 \nto 54 percent and a depression range of 3 to 30 percent). \n36 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 37 of 83\narriving at the U.S. border, for example, found that of234 adults interviewed, 32 percent ofthe \nsample group met diagnostic criteria for PTSD, 24 percent for depression, and 17 percent for \nboth disorders. Allen Keller et al., Pre-Migration Trauma Exposure and Mental Health \nFunctioning Among Central American Migrants Arriving at the US. Border, 12 PLoS ONE (Jan \n10, 2017). \n165.  As asylum seekers, the parents in the instant case unsurprisingly \"arrived in the United \nStates already worn down.\" Cohen Decl. at 2. \"All had endured a protracted period of fear and \nviolence in their own countries before making the difficult decision to leave . . . Many had \nendured tremendous physical hardship or violence before leaving and arrived physically \nweakened by a long journey.\" !d. \n166.  Against the backdrop of this baseline trauma, family separation predictably caused these \nparents severe emotional distress, including symptoms that rose to the level of cognitive \ndisability. See Ms. L. v.  US Immigration & Customs Enft (\"ICE''), 310 F. Supp. 3d 1133, 1146 \n(S.D. Cal. 2018) (noting that the trauma parents have suffered as a result of the family separation \npolicy \"deserves special mention\" and \"constitutes irreparable harm\"). \n167.  As Dr. Cohen details, the representative sample of parents she interviewed described \n\"severe symptoms arising from all four categories of traumatic response\" and accordingly \nqualified for a diagnosis of Acute Stress Response. Cohen Decl. at 2. The four categories were: \nintrusion symptoms (involuntary distressing memories of the separation, sleep disturbance and \nnightmares, or obsessional reliving of the loss of the child); avoidance symptoms (avoiding \nreminders of the distressing subject matter); negative alterations in cognition and mood \n(persistent experience of profound suffering and misery and inability to distract oneself from \nanxiety and depression); and marked alterations in arousal and reactivity (persistent experience \n37 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 38 of 83\nof fear or anxiety and exaggerated startle response, difficulty sitting still). !d. at 2-3. Physical \nsymptoms included sleep disturbance, loss of appetite, palpitations and headaches, weight loss, \nlightheadedness, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain and nausea. !d. \n168.  Parents' own distress at being separated from their children was exacerbated by their \nperception of the distress their children were experiencing as well. See Diagnostic and Stat. \nManual, 5th Ed. at 271 (defining trauma to include vicarious exposure such as \"witnessing, in \nperson, the traumatic event( s) as it occurred to others [or] learning that the traumatic event( s) \noccurred to a close family member.\") and Fact Sheet: The Trauma of Childhood Separation, \nHistory of Psychiatry, Weill Cornell Medicine (July 2, 2018) (describing impact on children of \ntrauma due to separation from their parents). As Dr. Cohen describes, each of the parents in the \nrepresentative sample she interviewed experienced symptoms such as visualization of the \ntorment and suffering of their lost child: \"I see my child and she is calling for me but I'm tied up \nin chains and can't get to her. I scream for someone to help but nobody comes.\" Cohen Decl. at \n2. \n169.  Several Plaintiffs reported that during the single short phone call they had with their \nchild, their child wept the entire time, was extremely distressed, or related highly disturbing \nstories about being threatened or told they would be beaten if they cried. Others had had no \ncontact with their children and were intensely anxious and worried about their whereabouts and \nwell-being. All experienced extreme distress at the thought that their children were distressed or \nnot doing well. \n170.  As a result of this distress, the representative sample of separated parents Dr. Cohen \ninterviewed \"all described an inability to think clearly: to process information, to organize \ninformation, to retrieve memories in full ... None were able to describe priorities beyond that of \n38 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 39 of 83\ngetting their children back and none were able to think in broader, abstract strategic terms.\" \nCohen Decl. at 3. By reason oftheir acute trauma, the parents could not perform basic functions \nessential to communicating the grounds for their asylum claims.2 \n171.  Parents in this situation were likely also experiencing a range of other symptoms that \nmade it impossible for them to clearly recall and coherently articulate the reasons for their fear of \nreturn to their home countries. See, e.g., Expert Statement on the Impact of Parent-Child \nSeparation on Parents' Ability to Effectively Participate in Asylum Proceedings, attached hereto \nas \"Exhibit B.\" \n172.  A typical example of this can be found in a recording of an immigration judge review of \na denied credible fear interview, conducted at the immigration court located in the Port Isabel \nDetention Center.  See https://soundcloud.com/user-488995707 /ij-hearing-1 (last visited August \n17, 2018).  The Respondent, a mother who had been subjected to the government's policy of \nforcible family separation, opens the hearing by audibly sobbing and saying, \"I cannot go \nforward, I don't feel well.  I cannot stand the feeling in my head.\"  In response, the immigration \njudge offers to push her case to the back of that day's calendar, to \"give you time to compose \nyourself.\" \"What do you want to do?,\" asks the immigration judge, to which the distraught \nmother answers, \"What I want is to be with my son.\"  The immigration judge responds, \"I \nunderstand that.  Is there anything you want to say regarding your case?\" The mother answers, \"I \ncannot continue with this anymore.  What I want is to be with my son.\" \n2 The distress parents were experiencing and their inability to participate in interviews and \nhearings is illustrated in audio recordings released by news outlets of parents describing feeling \nill and unable to participate in their proceedings. See, e.g., Hear: Immigrant Moms Plead with \nJudge for Kids, CNN, at 2:38 (Jul. 24, 2018), https://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2018/07/24/ \ndetention-center-audio-mothers-separated-orig-al.cnn/video/playlists/family-separations. \n39 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 40 of 83\n173.  Faced with a person who was obviously and apparently suffering disabling trauma, \ninstead of offering any accommodations whatsoever, the immigration judge simply says \"Okay,\" \nand then launches immediately into the merits ofthe case: \"Ma'am, you told the asylum officer \nthat you fear returning to your country because you were raped by your uncle in the year 2000, \nthat's when you were twelve years old, and you said you became pregnant by him?  Is that your \nchild?\" \n174.  Unlike most parents facing credible fear reviews, this mother was represented by counsel, \nand her attorney then sought to vacate the proceedings \"due to mental instability.\"  The \nimmigration judge simply responded, \"You need to take those up with the Department of \nHomeland Security.\"  The hearing concluded without the mother able to say one word in support \nof the substantive merits of her asylum claim, and-not surprisingly-the denial of credible fear \nwas upheld, and the mother was ordered removed from the United States.  As the mother left the \ncourtroom, the immigration judge directed court staff to take her straight to the medical unit. \nThe entire hearing lasted five minutes. \n175.  None of the parents received any accommodation for their impairment during their \ncredible fear interview or at their immigration judge reviews. As a result, each of them received a \nnegative credible fear determination despite compelling claims for asylum relief. \nIII.  The Government Implemented a Family Separation Policy That Traumatized \nParents,  and  Continued  to  Process  Parents  For Removal  Before They  Were \nReunited With Their Children. \n176.  As  set  forth  below,  pursuant to  the  \"zero  tolerance\"  policy,  the  family  reunification \nexecutive order as explained in a DHS fact sheet published on June 23, 2018, and further written \npolicies implementing the zero tolerance policy and the executive order, Defendants have put in \nplace a policy of: \n40 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 41 of 83\n•  continuing to process parents quickly for removal and to reunify them with their children \nonly \"for the purpose of removal\" after they had already received a deportation order; \n•  pushing traumatized parents through credible fear interviews before they were reunified \nwith their children, while they were not competent to participate in such interviews, and \nwithout any  accommodations for the trauma and other psychological  conditions their \nseparation from their children caused them, in order to achieve the end of speedy removal; \nand \n•  relying on those defective credible· fear interviews to issue expedited orders of removal, \nthereby depriving Plaintiffs of a meaningful opportunity to apply for the protection of \nasylum.  See,  e.g.,  Fact Sheet:  Zero-Tolerance Prosecution and Family Reunification, \nattached hereto as \"Exhibit C.\" \nA.  The Zero Tolerance Policy \n177.  On April 6, 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a \"zero tolerance policy\" for \npersons seeking asylum who cross the border at points other than a legal port of entry, stating \nthat they would \"be met with the full prosecutorial powers of the Department of Justice.\"3 \n178.  On May 7, 2018, he further stated with respect to individuals crossing the border with a \nchild that \"we will prosecute you. And [your] child may be separated from you.\"4 \n3 Press Release, U.S. Dep't of Justice, Attorney General Announces Zero-Tolerance Policy for \nCriminal Illegal Entry (Apr. 6, 2018), https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general \nannounces-zero-tolerance-policy- criminal-illegal-entry. \n4 Brett Samuels, Sessions unveils 'zero tolerance' policy at southern border, The Hill (May 7, \n2 0 18), http ://thehill. com/homenews/a dministration/3 86 63 4-sessions-illegal-border-crossers-will \nbe-prosecuted-families-may-be. \n41 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 42 of 83\n179.  This family separation policy operationalized a long-standing decision by administration \nofficials to separate parents and children in order to deter asylum seekers from coming to the \nUnited States.5 \n180.  The government began to apply its \"zero-tolerance policy\" against parents who crossed \nthe border with their own children seeking asylum. Prosecution under the new policy resulted in \nsystematic forcible separation of parents from their children. The parents were prosecuted \ncriminally for unlawful entry, and their children were taken away from them, deemed \n\"unaccompanied,\" and moved to locations that were not disclosed to the parents.6 \n181.  Children forcibly separated from their parents were transferred to the custody of the \nOffice of Refugee Resettlement, a component ofthe Department ofHealth and Human Services. \n!d. For weeks or months after separation, most parents had no knowledge of the whereabouts or \nconditions of their children. As previously described, many parents had only a single short phone \ncall with their child, during which the child wept inconsolably or expressed extreme distress. \nOthers had no contact with their children. Most did not know the whereabouts of their children, \neven after they had a brief phone call with them. \nB.  The Family Reunification Executive Order and Written Implementing Policies To \nReunify Parents With Children Only \"For the Purpose of Removal\" \n5 See John Haltiwanger, John Kelly proposed separating children from their parents to deter \nillegal immigration last year, and now the Trump administration can't get its story straight, \nBusiness Insider (June 18, 20 18), https://www. businessinsider.com/kelly-proposed-family \nseparation-to-deter-illegal-immigration-in-2017-2018-6; Jonathan Blitzer, How the Trump \nAdministration Got Comfortable Separating Immigrant Kids from Their Parents, New Yorker \n(May 30, 20 18), https :// www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-the-trump-administration \ngot -comfortable-separating-immigrant-kids-from-their-parents. \n6 Sarah Almukhtar, Troy Griggs and Karen Yourish, How Trump's Policy Change Separated \nMigrant Children From Their Parents, N.Y.

In the face of widespread public condemnation, President Trump purportedly retracted \nthe family separation policy by Executive Order (hereinafter \"EO\") on June 20, 2018.7 \n183.  The EO, however, did not include any provisions to reunite families that had been \nseparated prior to June 20. Federal officials stated that those children would not be reunited with \ntheir families while the adults remain in federal custody during their immigration proceedings. A \ngovernment spokesperson stated that there would \"not be a grandfathering of existing cases. \"8 \n184.  Instead, written policies implementing the EO made clear that the purpose was to \ncontinue processing parents for removal and to reunify them with their children only at the point \nwhere they were preparing to remove them from the United States. \n185.  On June 23,2018, DHS released a Fact Sheet about the EO stating explicitly that the \nfamily reunification process will reunify children with parents \"for the purposes of removal.\"9 \nThe fact sheet specifies that \"[o]nce the parent's immigration case has been adjudicated ... , ICE \nwill seek to reunite verified family units and link their removal proceedings so that family units \ncan be returned to their home countries together.\"10 The fact sheet makes no provision for \nreunifying children before the conclusion of their parents' immigration proceedings or for \n7 Exec.

The fact sheet reflects a clear policy of continuing to process parents quickly for removal \nand to reunify them with their children only \"for the purpose of removal\" after they had already \nreceived a deportation order, pushing them through their credible fear interviews quickly and \nwithout accommodations for their trauma in order to achieve that end. \n187.  In court proceedings, Justice Department attorney Sarah Fabian confirmed that there was \nno procedure or mechanism in place for parents awaiting credible fear determinations to reunite \nwith their separated children. 11 \n188.  Instead, on information and belief, further written policies and guidelines directed that \nparents should continue to be processed for removal before reunification, including forcing \nparents to undergo credible fear interviews without safeguards or reasonable accommodations \nfor the trauma caused by separation from their children. \nC.  Effects of the Zero Tolerance Policy, the Family Reunification EO and Fact Sheet, \nand Subsequent Implementing Policies Continuing CFis For Traumatized Parents \n189.  During the time between the implementation of the \"zero-tolerance policy\" and the \nissuance of the EO, more than 2,300 children were separated from their families.12 \n190.  Most parents had no knowledge of their children's whereabouts and frequently had little \nor no contact with their children for the entire period of separation. \n11 Tal Kopan, Government never had specific plan to reunfjj; families, court testimony shows, \nCNN (June 29, 2018), https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/29/politics/family-separations \nreunification-never-plan-court/index.html. \n12 See Tal Kopan and Veronica Stracqualursi, Trump administration: Some children currently in \nBorder Patrol custody will be reunited with parents, CNN, (June 21, 2018), \nhttps :// www.cnn.com/20 18/06/21 /politics/children-border-reunited/index.html. \n44 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 45 of 83\n191.  Even government officials had difficulty obtaining any answers from the government \nabout the numbers and whereabouts of children who had been separated from their parents; New \nYa rk Governor Andrew Cuomo, for example, reported that federal officials would not even tell \nhim the number of children that had been sent to his state's facilities.13 \n192.  On June 26, 2018, a federal judge ordered the government to reunify all families who \nhave been separated from their children. The judge ordered that all children under the age of 5 \nshould be reunified with their parents by July 10, and that all other children should be reunified \nwith their parents by July 26. See Ms. L. v.  US Immigration and Customs Enf't, 310 F. Supp. 3d \n1133 (S.D. Cal. 20 18). The government did not meet the July 10 or the July 26 deadlines.14 Court \nproceedings in that case remain ongoing. \n193.  During the time that parents were separated from their children, countless parents \nunderwent interviews with asylum officers in which they were, in theory, given the opportunity \nto explain the basis for their fear of return to their home country. Because the EO failed to \nprovide for reunification of parents already separated from their children, the government \nimplemented written policies to continue rushing parents through the credible fear interview \nprocess despite their ongoing separation from their children and resulting trauma. As set forth \npreviously, the separated parents were not competent to complete such an interview at that time. \n194.  The credible fear interviews to which Plaintiffs were subjected were also fatally deficient \nbecause of unlawful written policies directing asylum officers to make negative findings if the \n13 Margaret Hartmann, Trump Administration Still Has No Plan for Reuniting the Families It \nSeparated, N.Y.

Sessions, 1:18-cv-01853-EGS (D.D.C. filed Aug. 7, 2018), and Plaintiffs in this action \nare entitled to relief from removal on this additional ground as well. \n195.  Defendants have deported over 450 parents without their children since the issuance of \nthe zero tolerance policy .16 They have issued negative credible fear determinations to an \nunknown number of parents who went through their credible fear interviews without \naccommodations while they were traumatized by their separation from their children. \n196.  Parents continued to be deported without their children after the EO, pursuant to the DHS \nfact sheet and other implementing policies directing that immigration agencies continue \nprocessing parents for removal before reunification. 17 \n197.  But for a temporary court order blocking the government from deporting reunified \nparents and their children, Defendants' policy is to deport families immediately upon \nreunification on the basis of fundamentally flawed negative credible fear findings.18 \n15 See also, USCIS, July 11,2018 Policy Memorandum, Guidance for Processing Reasonable \nFear, Credible Fear, Asylum, and Refugee Claims in Accordance with Matter of A-B-. \n16 See Miriam Jordan & Caitlin Dickerson, More Than 450 Migrant Parents May Have Been \nDeported Without Their Children, N.Y.

Defendants' actions were undertaken pursuant to the zero tolerance policy, the EO, the \nfact sheet guidelines, and, upon information and belief and based on all available evidence, \nwritten policies and directives issued after the EO which specify that separated parents should \ncontinue to undergo credible fear interviews and be processed for expedited removal before \nreunification, in order to ensure speedy removal after reunification. \nLEGAL BACKGROUND \nI.  The Asylum Laws, Credible Fear Interviews, and Safeguards For Persons Who \nAre Not Competent \n199.  United States law entitles non-citizens on U.S. soil to seek asylum without regard to how \nor where they arrive. 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1). \n200.  Since 1996, immigration law has also provided for an abbreviated \"expedited removal\" \na \nprocess, where certain individuals may be deported from the United States without  removal \nhearing before an immigrationjudge.ld. § 1225(b)(l)(A)(i). \n201.  Even an individual subject to expedited removal, however, must be referred to an asylum \nofficer for a credible fear interview if he or she indicates an intention to apply for asylum or a \nfear of persecution in his or her home country. !d. § 1225(b)(l)(A)(ii). An asylum officer must \nthen conduct a screening interview to determine whether the asylum seeker has a credible fear of \npersecution. \n202.  If an asylum officer determines that there is a \"significant possibility\" that such an \nindividual could prove eligibility for fear-based relief, then the asylum seeker is placed into \nregular removal proceedings.ld. §§ 1225(b)(l)(B)(ii) and (v). \n203.  If, however, an individual in this posture is determined not to have a credible fear of \nreturn, he or she may only appeal that determination in a very limited way to an immigration \njudge who conducts a cursory review of the asylum officer's finding. If the judge affirms the \n47 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 48 of 83\nasylum officer's negative determination or if the individual does not appeal the asylum officer's \ndetermination, he or she is sent back to ICE or CBP for immediate removal. \n204.  Thus, for persons in expedited removal proceedings, the credible fear interview is the \nonly way to access the asylum process and to avoid removal to dangerous or life-threatening \nconditions. \n205.  In conducting a credible fear interview, the asylum officer must take into account the \nperson's statements as well as other facts known to the asylum officer. 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(d). \n206.  In preparing for a credible fear interview, an individual may consult with any person of \nhis or her choosing, including family members. 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iv). \n207.  It is generally within ICE and CBP's discretion not to place an individual in expedited \nremoval proceedings and instead to place them in ordinary removal proceedings before an \nimmigration judge. It is also within ICE and CBP's discretion to refer an individual already in \nexpedited removal proceedings to regular removal proceedings before an immigration judge, \neven if that individual has already received a negative credible fear determination. \nII.  Safeguards For Persons With Mental Incapacity In Removal Proceedings \n208.  In the context of regular removal proceedings before an immigration judge, the Board of \nImmigration Appeals (\"BIA'') has emphasized the importance of fundamental fairness. See \nMatter ofTomas, 19 I&N Dec. 464, 465 (BIA 1987). \n209.  In pursuit of such fairness, the INA provides for additional safeguards when an \nimmigrant lacks mental competency. Title 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b )(3) requires that, during removal \nproceedings, immigration judges \"prescribe safeguards to protect the rights and privileges\" of an \nimmigrant who lacks mental competency. \n48 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 49 of 83\n210.  Several regulations provide further guidance on these safeguards. 8 C.F.R. §§ \n103.8(c)(2)(ii), 1240.4, 1240.10(c). Among such existing \"safeguards\" are that (1) immigration \njudges (\"IJ''s) are prohibited from accepting admissions of removability from an unrepresented \nperson who is incompetent and unaccompanied, 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(c); (2) the government is \nrequired to serve the notice to appear in court on a mentally incompetent individual's \nrepresentative, 8 C.F.R. § 103.5a(c)(2)(ii); and (3) a representative or guardian is permitted to \nappear on behalf of a mentally incompetent individual in removal proceedings, 8 C.F.R. § \n1240.4. \n211.  Courts have also weighed in on what constitutes additional safeguards in this context. \nThe BIA in Matter ofM  -A-M-, 25 I&N Dec. 474, 477 (BIA 2011), stated that the INA's \n\"invocation of safeguards presumes that proceedings can go forward ... provided the proceeding \nis conducted fairly.\" M-A-M- explained that Us can utilize a number of safeguards after assessing \nthe respondent's competency. M-A-M-, 25 I&N Dec. at 483. \n212.  Under established BIA precedent, Us have an affirmative duty to inquire into the mental \ncompetence of individuals. If an applicant shows \"indicia of incompetency,\" the U has an \nindependent duty to determine whether the applicant is competent. Id. at 480. Indicia can include \n\"the inability to understand and respond to questions, the inability to stay on topic, or a high \nlevel of distraction,\" as well as \"evidence of mental illness,\" id. at 479, such as the mental health \nconditions suffered by parents who have been separated from their children. \n213.  Us \"must take measures\" to assess an individual's competence when there are indicia of \nincompetence, such as questioning the individual simply, continuing proceedings to allow for \nevidence gathering, allowing assistance from friends and family, asking the individual about his \nor her psychiatric medication and its purpose and effects, and arranging for a psychiatric \n49 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 50 of 83\nevaluation. !d. at 480-81; see also Matter ofJ -S-S-, 26 I&N Dec. 679, 681-84 (BIA 20 15) \n(describing IJs' responsibilities in, and standards of proof for, determining competence). \n214.  DHS also has obligations to assist the court in making a competency determination. \n\"DHS will often be in possession of relevant evidence, particularly where the alien is detained. \nThe DHS has an obligation to provide the court with relevant materials in its possession that \nwould inform the court about the respondent's mental competency.\" M-A-M-, 25 I&N Dec. at \n480 (citing 8 C.P.R.§ 1240.2(a); Matter ofS-M-J-, 21 I. & N. Dec. 722, 726-27 (BIA 1997)). \n215.  The BIA has also ordered immigration courts to make accommodations for people with \nmental health conditions, regardless of whether the disability rises to the level of incompetence. \nId; see also Matter ofJ -R-R-A-, 26 I&N Dec. 609, 610-12 (BIA 2015) (requiring an \naccommodation for a respondent with mental health issues without a formal finding of \nincompetency). Matter ofJ -R-R-A- contemplates applicants who are deemed incompetent or who \nhave \"a mental illness or serious cognitive disability\" that \"affect[s] [their] ability to provide \ntestimony in a coherent, linear manner.\" !d. at 611. Safeguards are to be applied where \"a mental \nhealth concern may be affecting the reliability of the applicant's testimony.\" !d. at 612. \n216.  Where, as here, cognitive ability is impaired, including due to an inability to process and \nretrieve information properly or communicate effectively, see supra Factual Background, \nsafeguards are appropriate and individuals are not competent to participate in any type of \nimmigration proceeding. \nIII.  Safeguards Should Be Applied In the Credible Fear Interview Process. \n21 7.  Safeguards should be applied to expedited removal and the credible fear interview \nprocess. \n50 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 51 of 83\n218.  Under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(l)(B)(v), \"credible fear ofpersecution\" is defined as \"a \nsignificant possibility, taking into account the credibility of the statements made by the alien in \nsupport of the alien's claim and such other facts as are known to the officer, that the alien could \nestablish eligibility for asylum ... \" (emphasis added). That credibility cannot appropriately be \nassessed if the individual undergoing the interview is not competent to testify at the time of the \ninterview. \n219.  Regulations state that the purpose of the credible fear interview \"shall be to elicit all \nrelevant and useful information bearing on whether the applicant has a credible fear or \npersecution or torture.\" 8 C.P.R. 208.30(d). In credible fear interviews, immigrants are almost \nalways solely relying on their own testimony in order to establish that they have a credible fear \nof persecution. \" [A] 11 relevant and useful information\" cannot be elicited when the main \npurveyor of this information is incompetent to participate in the interview. \n220.  Title 8 U.S. C. § 1225(b) also allows for limited appeal to an immigration judge, where \nsafeguard provisions clearly apply. The \"elicit[ing] [of] all relevant and useful information\" is \nnot possible when an individual is not competent to present such information to the asylum \nofficer, particularly where the only record before the Immigration Judge at the limited review \nstage is the underlying credible fear determination. \n221.  When read in context, the credible fear provisions should be interpreted to provide \nsafeguards for persons who are mentally incompetent or otherwise impaired from relating the \ncircumstances that led to their fear or establishing their credibility, as in the instant case. See \nCohen Decl. at 3. \n222.  Without accommodation that takes these impairments into account, the credible fear \nprovisions would be in conflict with the object and policy of the INA to provide additional \n51 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 52 of 83\nsafeguards to immigrants who are unable to competently participate in their immigration \nproceedings, thereby undermining the fundamental fairness of those proceedings. \n223.  The contrast between the reality of these parents' interviews and the guidance provided to \ninterviewing officers in the asylum manual is also striking. For example, with regard to asylum \ninterviews of individuals unable to testify on their own behalf due to mental incompetence, the \nmanual states: \"there may be cases in which an applicant manifests behavior that leads Asylum \nOffice personnel to question the applicant's ability to provide competent testimony.\" Asylum \nProcedures Manual (2013). The Manual, furthermore, assumes that parents and children will be \nnear each other for the interview, and though minor children may be dismissed for a portion of \nthe interview, \"[g]enerally, an AO should consult with the principal applicant to determine his or \nher preference before dismissing any dependent.\" ld. There is no meaningful reason that would \nmandate different procedures in the context of a credible fear interview. \n224.  The asylum and credible fear provisions, read in their totality and within the overall \ncontext of the INA, require that individuals with mental health conditions, including acute \ntrauma and anxiety related to family separation, be provided with procedural safeguards in their \nasylum and credible fear determinations. \nIV.  The Rehabilitation Act \n225.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 701 et seq. (\"Rehab Act\") provides in \npertinent part that \"no otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States ... \nshall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied \nthe benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal \nfinancial assistance or ... conducted by any Executive agency.\" 20 U.S.C. § 794(a). \n52 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 53 of 83\n226.  Defendant agencies' implementing regulations, 6 C.F.R. §15.1 et seq. (DHS); 28 C.F.R. \n§3 9.1 01 et seq. (DOJ), similarly mandate that Defendants not discriminate against individuals \nwith a disability or deny equal access to their programs and benefits on that basis. The DHS \nregulations require the Department to operate each program or activity, when viewed in its \nentirety, in a way that is \"readily accessible to and usable by individuals with a disability.\" 6 \nC.F.R. § 15.50. \n227.  The term \"disability\" means any physical or mental impairment that \"substantially limits \none or more major life activities.\"  29 U.S.C. § 705. The Rehab Act and Americans with \nDisabilities Act (\"ADA\")19 also allow disability to be found based on a \"record of such an \nimpairment\" or \"being regarded as having such an impairment.\" 29 U.S.C. § 705(20)(b); 42 \nU.S.C. § 12102(1).  Major life activities include \"learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, and \nworking,\" as well as \"the operation of a major bodily function, including ... neurological, brain, \n... [and] endocrine ... functions.\" 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A)-(B). The ADA mandates that \n\"[t]he definition of disability ... be construed in favor of broad coverage of individuals ... to the \nmaximum extent permitted by the terms of [the statute].\" Jd.  § 12102(4)(A). \n228.  The trauma-related mental disorders exhibited by plaintiffs satisfy the standard for \n\"disability\" set out in the Rehab Act. See, e.g., P.P. v. Compton United School District, 135 F. \nSupp. 3d 1098 (C.D. Cal. 2015) (finding mental health disabilities related to \"trauma\" and \n\"complex trauma\" met the statutory requirement for a disability under the Rehabilitation Act); \nAlexander v.  Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 301 (1985) (holding that the Rehabilitation Act requires \n19 To the extent possible, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Rehabilitation Act are \nconstrued to impose similar requirements; thus, despite the different language these statutes \nemploy, they require a plaintiff to demonstrate the same elements to establish liability. Halpern \nv.  Wake Forest Univ. Health Scis., 669 F.3d 454 (4th Cir. 2012). \n53 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 54 of 83\nreasonable accommodations be provided for mental disabilities); Franco-Gonzales v. Holder, \n767 F. Supp. 2d 1034, 1051 (C.D. Cal. 2010) (granting safeguards for mentally ill detainees in \nimmigration court under the Rehabilitation Act). \n229.  The trauma-related mental disorders exhibited by plaintiffs require accommodation under \nthe Rehabilitation Act not only because parents were traumatized, but also because this trauma \nwas predictably caused by Defendants' deliberate policies of forcibly separating parents from \ntheir children, then rushing parents through the credible fear process in an effort to deport them \nquickly from the United States. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n230.  Plaintiffs incorporate each allegation in the foregoing paragraphs, as  if fully  set forth \nherein. \n231.  Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3), judicial review is available before this Court regarding \nwhether \"a written policy directive, written policy guideline, or written procedure issued by or \nunder the authority ofthe Attorney General to implement [8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)] is not consistent \nwith applicable provisions of [the INA] or is otherwise in violation oflaw.\" \n232.  The INA and its implementing regulations, including 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(4)(B) and 8 \nC.F.R. 1240.10(a)(4), guarantee every noncitizen in removal proceedings a reasonable \nopportunity to present and object to evidence. \n233.  In addition, the INA and its implementing regulations, including 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(3) \nand 8 C.F.R. §§ 103.8(c)(2)(ii), 1240.4, 1240.10(c), require that additional safeguards be \nprovided to immigrants who lack mental competency to protect their rights in removal \n54 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 55 of 83\nproceedings. These safeguards unquestionably apply during an Immigration Judge's review of a \ncredible fear determination and should apply during credible fear interviews as well. \n234.  The INA defines \"credible fear of persecution\" as \"a significant possibility, taking into \naccount the credibility of the statements made by the alien in support ofthe alien's claim and \nsuch other facts as are known to the officer, that the alien could establish eligibility for asylum.\" \n8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)(B)(v).  That credibility cannot appropriately be assessed ifthe individual \nundergoing the interview is not competent to testify at the time of the interview. \n235.  Regulations state that the purpose of the credible fear interview \"shall be to elicit all \nrelevant and useful information bearing on whether the applicant has a credible fear of \npersecution or torture.\" 8 C.F.R. 208.30(d). \n236.  Asylum seekers suffering from mental health conditions, such as trauma, depression, and \nanxiety as a result of being separated from their children qualify for additional procedural \nsafeguards. \n237.  To avoid inconsistency with the context and structure of the Immigration and Nationality \nAct, 8 U.S.C. § 1158 and 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b) must be read to require the provision of procedural \nsafeguards during asylum and credible fear determinations for individuals with mental health \nconditions. \nDefendants acted contrary to the INA and its implementing regulations when they caused parents \nto go through credible fear interviews without any accommodations or safeguards, despite the \nfact that they were suffering from trauma caused by the separation and unable to fully participate \nin their own interviews, and when Defendants applied unlawfully stringent standards for a \nfinding of credible fear. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n55 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 56 of 83\nViolation of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 701 et seq. \n238.  Plaintiffs incorporate each allegation in the foregoing paragraphs, as if fully set forth \nherein. \n239.  The Plaintiffs are qualified individuals with disabilities under Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act. 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \n240.  Defendants receive federal financial assistance to operate the citizenship and immigration \nservices and related programs designed to support Plaintiffs. \n241.  The regulations accompanying Section 504 provide that: \"[r]ecipients shall administer \nprograms and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified \nhandicapped persons.\" 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(d). \n242.  These regulations further prohibit recipients of federal financial assistance from \n\"utiliz[ing] criteria or methods of administration ... (i) [t]hat have the effect of subjecting \nhandicapped persons to discrimination on the basis of handicap; [or] (ii) that have the purpose or \neffect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the recipient's \nprogram with respect to handicapped persons.\" 28 C.F.R. § 41.5l(b)(3); 45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b). \n243.  Plaintiffs qualify for the immigration services provided by Defendants. Likewise, \nPlaintiffs would benefit from the immigration services and programs provided by Defendants. \n244.  Defendants unlawfully discriminated against Plaintiffs by forcing them to participate in \nCFis without providing a reasonable accommodation for the mental disability caused by \nDefendants generally applicable policy of separating immigrant parents from their children. \nDefendants also discriminated against Plaintiffs by denying them and/or excluding them from \nqualifying programs and/or activities due to their disabilities. \n56 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 57 of 83\n245.  Moreover, Defendants' practice has a disparate impact on Plaintiffs and mentally \ndisabled individuals, who are forced to participate in CFis without a reasonable accommodation \nand/or receive negative credible fear determinations due to their disabilities. \n246.  Defendants would not have to fundamentally alter their programs or services to provide \nPlaintiffs with a reasonable accommodation that would allow Plaintiffs to participate fully and \nintelligibly in the CFI process. \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment \n24 7.  Plaintiffs incorporate each allegation in the foregoing paragraphs, as if fully set forth \nherein. \n248.  The Due Process Clause requires that civil litigants, including immigrants in regular or \nexpedited removal proceedings, be provided with a meaningful opportunity to be heard by \nremoving obstacles to their full participation in judicial or administrative proceedings to which \nthey are entitled. \n249.  Plaintiffs are entitled under the Due Process Clause to a fair hearing of their claims, and a \nmeaningful opportunity to establish their potential eligibility for asylum and related relief from \nremoval. \n250.  In order to guarantee their fundamental right to fair adjudications under the Due Process \nClause, asylum seekers must be provided with a reasonable-opportunity to make their case, \nincluding in the credible fear interview process. \n251.  By failing to provide Plaintiffs with a reasonable opportunity to be heard, by continuing \nto force them through their credible fear interviews while they were too traumatized to \n57 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 58 of 83\nparticipate in those interviews, and by applying an unlawful standard for a finding of credible \nfear, Defendants have violated Plaintiffs' Fifth Amendment right to due process. \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act \n252.  Plaintiffs incorporate each allegation in the foregoing paragraphs, as if fully set forth \nherein. \n253.  The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706, provides that a Court \"shall hold \nunlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be-(A) arbitrary, \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (B) contrary to \nconstitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity; [or] (C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, or \nlimitations, or short of statutory right.\" \n254.  Defendants' policy of continuing to force parents to undergo credible fear interviews \nduring the time they were separated from their children and traumatized by that separation is \narbitrary, capricious, contrary to law, and short of statutory right in multiple respects set forth in \nthe preceding paragraphs. \n255.  By continuing to force Plaintiffs through their credible fear interviews, at unlawfully \ndifficult standards, while they were too traumatized to participate in those interviews, Defendants \nhave violated the Administrative Procedure Act. \n58 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 59 of 83\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that the Court: \nA.  Declare that the policy of forcing traumatized parents to undergo credible fear interviews \nwithout accommodations is contrary to law; \nB.  Declare that the INA, the Rehab Act, and due process require the provision of \naccommodations for persons with mental disabilities who are undergoing credible fear \ninterviews; \nC.  Declare that Defendants' policy of relying on defective credible fear interviews to pursue \nexpedited removal is contrary to law; \nD.  Enjoin Defendants from conducting any further credible fear interviews for parents who are \nstill separated from their children without providing reasonable accommodations; \nE.  Enjoin Defendants from removing any individuals who have negative credible fear \ndeterminations and whose CFis were conducted during the time they were separated from their \nchildren; \nF.  Order that Defendants vacate negative credible fear determinations for all individuals who \nhad CFis during the time they were separated from their children; \nG.  Order that Defendants provide a new opportunity for a credible fear interview under lawful \nstandards and with reasonable accommodations for parents who underwent their original CFI \nduring the time they were separated from their children and were given a negative fear finding, \nor in the alternative, place those individuals in ordinary removal proceedings where safeguards \nare available; \nH.  A ward Plaintiffs their reasonable costs and attorneys' fees pursuant to the Equal Access to \nJustice Act and any other applicable statutory or regulatory provisions; and \n59 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 60 of 83\nI.

I am a physician licensed to practice medicine in the state of \nCalifornia.  I completed my medical school training at the Perelman School of Medicine at the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania in 1984 and graduated with honors. I completed a medical \ninternship, adult psychiatric residency and child psychiatric fellowship at Harvard in 1989. I \nhave over 30 years of experience working with traumatized populations of both children and \nadults in the United States and abroad. \nI have personally interviewed 11 individual parents -3 men and 9 women -who arrived in the \nUnited States seeking asylum and had their children taken from them, some immediately, \nothers within a day.  Marital status varied with some parents married, some separated, some \nunmarried in partnerships, some identified as single. Age ranged from 27 to 48 years. 5 of these \ninterviews were conducted by telephone and 6 were conducted in person at the Port Isabel \nDetention Center. All were conducted between July 1 and July 15, 2018. The average length of \ninterviews was 90 minutes, although some lasted 70 minutes and a few over 120 minutes. The \npurpose of these interviews was to gauge the mental status of these individuals following the \ntrauma of the loss of their children and to ascertain whether and, if so, how the response to this \ntrauma impacted their cognitive capacity, specifically their ability to engage in a structured \ninterview (\"Credible Fear Interview\") which represented a critical juncture in their pursuit of \nasylum and in which they would be required to process sometimes complex questions and to \nformulate accurate answers based on their memories of often highly charged circumstances in \ntheir home countries.  In short, I was asked to evaluate whether these parents were disabled as \nmanifest in their cognitive capacityI  competency to engage in these interviews while still \nseparated from their children. \nAs the \"zero tolerance\" policy which has resulted in mass child-parent separations in the United \nStates is itself unique, there is no specific literature pertaining to the morbidity associated with \nsuch an event.  However, much can be drawn from the extensive literature which examines \nparental response to the death of a child as well as some which describes parental response to \nkidnapping. \nSudden death and kidnapping of a child are both events which represent the closest parallel to \nthe experience of these parents. Without preparation or the capacity to intervene, these parents \nhad their children taken from them, sometimes forcefully and even violently. Many were told \nthat they would never see their children again. All were left in a state of terror and uncertainty -\nseveral for weeks -not knowing if their children were safe or even alive.  Even when put in \ncommunication with their children, they were not permitted to know where their children were, \nwhen or if they would see them again.  In the brief allotment of time given to some of the \nparents to communicate by telephone, all of their children expressed fear, distress and \ndesperation to see their parents again. Yet parents were rendered quite helpless, prevented \nfrom adequately comforting or protecting their children, from holding or touching them \n(essential to the comfort of younger children in particular), from offering any answers. Some \nparents were offered no opportunity to speak with their children for weeks and wondered if their \nchildren were alive, if they'd ever hear their voices again. All were frightened and consumed by \nthe certainty that their children were suffering while not knowing what potential horrors their \nchildren might be enduring. \nIt is well known that the trauma of child loss is nearly unparalleled in its impact on the minds \nand bodies of parents.  Every single parent described the moment that their children were taken \nfrom them as the single most vividly horrifying experience of their lives: \"shattering\" \n\"unbearable\", \"a nightmare\". \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 64 of 83\nAll of the parents I interviewed described their identity as parentsjprovidersjnurturers as the \nsingle most important role in their lives.  They view their capacity to nurture and protect their \nchildren as their first and most important responsibility.  Histories of these parents included \nmultiple rapes, the cutting of one father's throat with a machete, exposure to constant and \nunpredictable, life-threatening violence. Yet for all, it was the rescuing of their children from \nterrible danger that was the prime motivation for the undertaking of the perilous journey to the \nUnited States. All spoke of the efforts made to nurture and protect their children on the trip. \nMost went without food or water in order to give those rations to their children. Some who had \nbeen kidnapped on the journey wept in shame that they were not able to protect their children \nfrom the fearfulness of that experience. \nAs with any stressor, the impact of trauma is a product of the severity of the event (in this case, \nextremely severe) and the relative resilience of the victim. These parents arrived in the United \nStates already worn down by circumstances which left them even more susceptible to the \ndestructive impact of the loss of their children. All had endured a protracted period of fear and \nviolence in their own countries before making the difficult decision to leave. Wishing to keep \ntheir families safe, many had come with only part of their family and were forced to leave \nspouses and other children behind. Despite having made provisions for them, all worried about \nand missed the family members not with them. Many had endured tremendous physical \nhardship or violence before leaving and arrived physically weakened by a long journey with very \nlittle food or water. \nAll of the parents interviewed described severe symptoms arising from all four categories of \ntraumatic response and qualified for the diagnosis of an Acute Stress Response.  [The categories \nof impairment for ASR are identical to those for PTSD.  However, at the time of their Credible \nFear Interviews, one month had not yet passed since the trauma of child separation and so they \ndid not yet qualify for the diagnosis of PTSD.] \nAll described \"Intrusion Symptoms\" with involuntary distressing memories of the moment their \nchildren were taken from them and the aftermath during which, in some cases, guards would \nbehave cruelly, telling them that they would never see their children again.  Many had frank \n\"flashbacks\": A kind of waking nightmare in which the moment of separation would suddenly be \nrelived, as if it was happening again. Some would \"hear\" the harsh words of the guards as if they \nwere being spoken again and would turn around to find no one.  Nearly all had profoundly \ndistressing dreams with content related to their situation: \"I see my child and she is calling for \nme but I'm tied up in chains and can't get to her. I scream for someone to help but nobody \ncomes\".  Most events in the course of the day would trigger associations to their trauma: for \nexample, for many mealtime evoked the last time they'd eaten with their child or worry about \nwhether their child was being fed and cared for.  All had severe sleep disturbances, not only \nbecause of nightmares which would jolt them awake but also because bedtime often invited the \nmost obsessional reliving of the loss of their child and acute worries about his or her wellbeing. \nAll reported that these experiences and feelings left them exhausted, robbed them of their \nappetite, led to palpitations and headaches. \n\"Avoidance Symptoms\" were less relevant in this population, as it was impossible to avoid \nassociations with the original event.  But several spoke of seeing detention guards who reminded \nthem of those who had taken their child and doing all they could to avoid encounters with these \nguards. \nAll described \"Negative alterations in cognition and mood\" related to the trauma. Many were \nunable to defend against the fear that their children were being more actively harmed: physically \nor sexually abused. All felt confused and uncertain about information given to them about their \nchildren. All felt that they would never be the same again.  Many believed that at night they \nheard the sound of children crying or speaking despite there being no children in the detention \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 65 of 83\nfacility.  All described a persistent experience of profound suffering and misery and the inability \nto distract themselves even for a moment from the anxiety and depression which consumed \nthem. None was able to muster any interest in any activity not related to their children other \nthan reading their bible for comfort. \nAll experienced \"Marked alterations in arousal and reactivity\".  This was generally manifest by a \nchronic experience of anxiety or fear with an exaggerated startle response. All described \ndifficulty relaxing or sitting still, most with a marked restlessness and tremulousness. All \nreported palpitations and sleep disturbances beyond their obsessionality and nightmares. All \nawoke frequently and/ or early with difficulty getting back to sleep and a feeling of persistent \ndread upon awakening. \nTaken together these symptoms resulted in significant both physiological and psychological \nimpairments.  Many reported significant weight loss, general weakness and unwellness. Many \nhad persistent headaches. Several had developed new gastrointestinal symptoms: abdominal \npain and cramping, nausea, diarrhea.  Many felt chronically lightheaded. \nMost notably within this context, all described an inability to think clearly: to process \ninformation, to organize information, to retrieve memories in full.  All described difficulty \nfocusing, with many reporting frequently losing track of conversations, sometimes losing even \nthe thread of their own thoughts or words.  None were able to describe priorities beyond that of \ngetting their children back and none were able to think in broader, abstract strategic terms. \nDespite all appearing highly engaged in our interviews which were open-ended and \nunpressured, many misheard or required repetition of questions. All had difficulty processing \nor expressing some of their answers. \nFor those who had taken their Credible Fear Interview at the time of my assessment, all \ndescribed the experience as painful and confusing. Many reported that they'd informed the \ninterviewers that they felt unable to answer the questions due to their distress over the loss of \ntheir children, but were told they must do so anyway, to \"just answer yes or no\".  Many have \nreported that they have little to no memory of the interview, that they were barely able to speak \nbecause they were weeping throughout, that they were unable to hear the questions because they \nwere so distracted by their worry about their children, that they were unable to retrieve the \ninformation necessary to answer questions. \nCONCLUSION: The parents I interviewed were severely impaired both cognitively and \nphysiologically by the trauma they endured in the sudden, often violent removal of their \nchildren from their care and the attendant uncertainty of their children's whereabouts and well \nbeing. The impact of this trauma had been global and led to a myriad of impairments, several \nwithin the sphere of cognition. \nThese impairments would meet the legal definition of a \"disability\" in that that they \nsubstantially limited the capacity of these individuals to engage in an array of major life \nactivities, including their Credible Fear Interviews. \nAs a consequence of symptoms arising from the trauma of their loss, these parents would not \nhave been cognitively competent to process the questions or formulate answers to any fact \nbased, time-limited interview.  Indeed, their distraction by concerns for their children impaired \neven their ability to appreciate the importance of the interview in determining the fate of their \nasylum claims. \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 66 of 83\nI believe the broad sample of parents interviewed (some married, others single, fathers and \nmothers, an age range from 27 to 48) may be fairly considered to represent the class of parents \nimpacted by the extreme trauma of this child-parent separation. \nIn short, it is my professional opinion that all parents who endured the \"zero tolerance\" \ntraumatic separation from their children and remain separated from them should be considered \nnow and in the past incapable of perceiving and acting in their own interest, legally disabled, \nand cognitively too impaired to engage in a Credible Fear Interview. \nI declare under penalty of perjury and under the laws of the United States that the foregoing is \ntrue and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief. \nAmy J Cohen MD  08/15/18 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 67 of 83\nEXHIBITB \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 68 of 83\nMEDICINE \nStatement on the Impact of Parent-Child Separation on Parents' Ability to \nEffectively Participate in Asylum Proceedings \nThis statement was prepared by members of the Stanford Early Life Stress and \nPediatric Anxiety Program (ELSP AP) and Human Rights in Trauma Mental Health \nProgram (HRTMH), part of Stanford's Department ofPsychiatry and Behavioral \nSciences. ELSP AP is a multidisciplinary team with expertise in childhood trauma and \nposttraumatic stress. We aim to address the impact that trauma has on child development \nand family functioning through three core components: research, clinical work, and \ncommunity outreach. HRTMH advances and applies the impact oftrauma on survivors of \nhuman rights abuses with an eye towards informing transitional justice and judicial \nprocesses. \nParents/caregivers who have been separated from their children while presenting \nfor political asylum are required to participate in typical asylum proceedings, including \ncredible fear interviews.  However, the trauma of separation/disruption is likely to \nnegatively impact parents' /caregivers' ability to effectively participate in this process. \nThe current statement provides a review ofthe psychological theory, literature, and \nempirical evidence relevant to this issue. \nImpact of Parent-Child Separation/Disruption on Attachment \nAttachment is a scientifically researched life milestone that ensures the \npsychological and physical well-being ofthe attached individual (Bowlby, 1982). \nHumans are biologically pre-programmed to form attachments with others (especially \nchildren and parents/caregivers) because it guarantees survival. A secure attachment, in \nwhich caregivers are available and receptive to their child when needed (Ainsworth et al., \n1978), provides safety and healthy development of self-esteem, eagerness to learn, trust, \nand self-reliance and, thus, is crucial for an individual's psychological, cognitive, \nneurobiological, and social development. The attachment relationship not only is \nimportant for child development, but also is critical for parents'/caregiver's growth and \nwell-being (Bowlby, 1952). Therefore, ruptures in attachment can have a devastating \nimpact on both the child and the parent/caregiver. Research has shown that ruptures in \nparent-child attachment (due to experiences such as trauma, loss, and separation) are \nassociated with significant parental/caregiver distress and impairment in functioning \n(Bowlby, 1940; Glasgow & Gouse-Sheese, 1995; Mena et al., 2008; Sm1rez-Orozco, \nBang, & Kim, 2011). Forced separation/disruption during immigration is a unique form \nof separation due to the inherent uncertainty. This may lead parents to experience \n1 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 69 of 83\n\"ambiguous loss,\" a situation in which there is no certainty that their child will return the \nway he/she used to be (Boss, 2002). Since this loss cannot be reconciled with the \nuncertainty, the grief process is frozen. The impact of such a loss inhibits \nparents'/caregivers' cognitive functioning, which significantly impairs their coping and \ndecision-making capabilities. In his report to the World Health Organization, Bowlby \nsuggested that there are critical periods during separation/disruption and reunification that \nplay a role in mitigating the harmful, long-lasting effects on parent-child attachment \n(Bowlby, 1952). He concluded, and a wealth of other research has since shown, that the \ngreater the degree and length of the separation/disruption the more there is potential for \nirreversible damage. \nParent-child Separation/Disruption is a Source of Trauma and Traumatic Stress \nIn addition to the impact on attachment, forced and unexpected \nseparation/disruption of an individual from her/his loved ones is a source of trauma and \ntraumatic stress. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ofMental Disorders, 5th Edition \n(DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013) specifies the first criterion (Criterion \nA) for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as including \"exposure to actual or \nthreatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence\" through direct experience, \nwitnessing, or learning that the event occurred to a close family member or close friend. \nIn the case of forced family separation/disruption, parents/caregivers are faced with a \nsignificant threat to their child's well-being; from the parents' /caregivers' perspective, \nthe child is under threat and in danger of experiencing physical violence (with potential to \nresult in serious physical injury), sexual violation, or even death.  It is our opinion that \nforced family separation/disruption therefore meets Criterion A for PTSD. As a result, we \ncan expect many parents/caregivers to experience the symptoms ofPTSD following the \nseparation/disruption from their children; such symptoms include intrusive thoughts and \nfeelings (e.g., unwanted memories, flashbacks, nightmares), avoidance oftrauma \nreminders (thoughts, feelings, and external stimuli), negative mood and cognition (e.g., \nmemory difficulty, negative thoughts about the world), and hyperarousal (e.g., difficulty \nconcentrating, irritability, hypervigilance). Not all of these symptoms are necessary in \norder to experience functional impairment. Furthermore, it is widely known that exposure \nto traumatic events and threats to an individual's or loved one's well-being commonly \nresults in a wide array of psychological symptoms beyond PTSD (Briere & Scott, 2015), \nsuch as depression, anxiety, dissociation, mood instability, and psychosis. These \nsymptoms oftrauma-related distress can be expected to severely affect \nparents' /caregivers' ability to provide coherent testimony, recounting, and narrative in \nasylum proceedings, as will be discussed further in this declaration. \nIn addition to the traumatic impact oft.he singular experience of family \nseparation/disruption, additional characteristics of asylum-seeking parents' /caregivers' \nforced separation/disruption from their children are expected to significantly exacerbate \nthe symptoms of traumatic distress. First, as mentioned above, the traumatic \nseparation/disruption is ongoing, the loss is ambiguous, and there is undetermined \nresolution. Without having any expectation or knowledge of children's well-being or \nplans for reunification, parents' /caregivers' distress will be continually heightened. \nExtended chronicity and duration of the trauma or related threat are known to increase the \n2 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 70 of 83\nfrequency and severity oftrauma-related psychological symptoms (Ford eta!., 2015). \nSecond, parents/caregivers experience a significant loss of control and helplessness in \nthis situation. They have little or no knowledge of their children's whereabouts or well \nbeing, and minimal control over the outcomes for their children. The lack of perceived \ncontrol during traumatic events engenders a sense of helplessness, which exacerbates \ntrauma-related distress and negative psychological outcomes (Ford eta!., 2015). \nSimilarly, parents'/caregivers' inability to contact, comfort, and communicate \nwith their children reduces their sense of control, and in many cases strips them of the \nopportunity to perform their highest priority function in society: to care for and ensure the \nwell-being of their offspring. When individuals are prevented from executing their \nsocietal roles and functions, they can be expected to experience psychological distress; \nonce again, this will exacerbate the symptoms related to the trauma of \nseparation/disruption. Finally, asylum-seeking parents/caregivers have inherently \nexperienced prior traumatic events in their lives, as this constitutes the basis for seeking \nasylum.  Traumatic stress is cumulative, and exposure to multiple or repeated traumatic \nevents over the lifespan has been shown to increase risk, severity, and complexity of \ntrauma-related symptoms (Cloitre eta!., 2009). Therefore, the trauma of forced family \nseparation/disruption compounds the prior traumas experienced by parents/caregivers \n(commonly including violence exposure, abuse, and traumatic loss) with the expected \nimpact of significantly worsening psycho logical outcomes, levels of functioning, and \nability to effectively engage in asylum proceedings. A growing body of empirical \nresearch has indeed demonstrated that parent-child separation/disruption during \nimmigration processes (as well as corresponding parental detention and threat of \ndeportation) is associated with increased risk, rates, and severity of mental health \nproblems for parents/caregivers (Brabeck & Xu, 2010; Linton, Griffin, & Shapiro, 2017; \nRusch & Reyes, 2013; Swirez-Orozco, Bang, & Kim, 2011). \nNeurobiological Effects of Stress \nTraumatic stress, such as being separated from one's child as described above, has \nmeasurable effects on neurobiological and physiological functioning. When humans \nexperience a stressor, physiological and mental resources are diverted to responding to \nthe stressor (Ulrich-Lai and Herman, 2009). This response involves engagement of \nemotion processing centers of the brain, release of stress hormones, and activation of the \nsympathetic nervous system, resulting in a \"fight, flight, or freeze\" reaction. Under these \ncircumstances, the human brain focuses on surviving the immediate threat, and other \nareas of the brain essentially go on lockdown until the threat is resolved. Thus, more \ncomplex cognitive functions are impaired while the body focuses on maintaining safety. \nExecutive functioning, or the ability to solve problems, evaluate consequences, and make \ndecisions, is particularly vulnerable to the effects of stress (Arnsten, 2009). \nAs described above, forced separation/disruption during the immigration process \ninvolves an ongoing, ambiguous, unresolved stressor. This experience greatly disrupts \nand diminishes organization, planning, and problem-solving. In addition, remaining in \nthis heightened state of stress response can lead to physical and mental exhaustion, likely \nexacerbated by lack of sleep in parents/caregivers detained and separated from their \nchildren. Thus, the traumatic stress of forced separation/disruption from children puts a \n3 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 71 of 83\nparent/caregiver at an extreme disadvantage in the capacity to navigate the process of \ngetting out of expedited removal proceedings, submitting a claim for asylum, and \ncompleting a credible fear interview. \nImpaired Ability to Conduct Interviews and Provide Testimony \nAs previously discussed, parents/caregivers separated from their children are \nlikely experiencing symptoms ofPTSD and additional mental health difficulties. Of \nparticular concern is the impact on cognitive functioning related to the neurobiological \nstress response. Research has consistently found that several cognitive functions, \nincluding but not limited to attention, communication, and memory, are significantly \nimpaired in individuals with PTSD and traumatic distress (Flaks et al., 2014; Olff, Polak, \nWitteveen, & Denys, 2014). In terms of attention, abnormalities in concentration, shifting \nof attention, and working memory capacity are common (Flaks et al., 2014; Olffet al., \n2014), largely due to intrusive and distressing memories and thoughts (Flaks et al., 2014). \nIn regard to forced family separation/disruption, parents/caregivers can be expected to \nstruggle with memories of being separated from their children and ongoing thoughts of \nconcern for their wellbeing. Parents/caregivers are expected to be overwhelmed and \npreoccupied by their concern for their children, with their functioning dictated by the \nautomatic \"fight, flight, or freeze\" responses that effectively render them incapable of \nfocusing on secondary priorities or other historical events. Therefore, despite their \nintentions and efforts, they will likely experience difficulties in maintaining focus and \nprocessing information appropriately, negatively affecting their ability to participate in \nasylum proceedings and credible fear interviews. \nIn addition to imp.airing attention, intrusive and distressing memories and \nthoughts interfere with the ability to effectively recall information (Flaks et al., 20 14; \nSchweizer & Dalgleish, 2011). Specifically, memories become fragmented and \ndisorganized as well as difficult to retrieve (Polak et al., 2014; Schweizer & Dalgleish, \n2011). This means that while individuals may recall sensations and emotions associated \nwith a memory, they tend to encounter difficulties in retrieving details or in providing \nconsistent and coherent retelling of events (Schweizer & Dalgleish, 2011). Further, \nemotionally-laden information is typically affected to· a greater degree than emotionally \nneutral information (Schweizer & Dalgleish, 2011 ). Thus, providing emotional narratives \nof events is pm1icularly difficult for individuals experiencing symptoms of PTSD and \ntrauma-related distress. This is especially true for asylum seekers with PTSD, who have \nbeen shown to demonstrate poorer memory specificity (Graham, Herlihy, & Brewin, \n20 14). In the case of forced family separation/disruption, even when attention is not \ndiverted to separation from their children, parents/caregivers can be expected to \nexperience difficulties in recalling information regarding their fears of persecution in \ntheir home countries. This may result in failing to provide important and relevant details \nto support their cases, negatively impacting their ability to provide comprehensive and \ncompelling information in asylum proceedings. These difficulties are even further \nexacerbated in the case of currently separated parents/caregivers, as their trauma is \nongoing and unresolved (thus heightening the frequency and severity ofthe traumatic \nstress response and related symptoms). \n4 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 72 of 83\nAdditionally, memories, including those of traumatic events, are naturally \nsusceptible to misinformation effects (Paz-Alonso & Goodman, 2008). Misinformation \neffects occur when an individual's recall of episodic memories become less effective due \nto post-event information (Paz-Aionso & Goodman, 2008). This is further perpetuated by \na delay between memory formation and memory recall (Paz-Aionso & Goodman, 2008). \nThus, as more time passes, and new information is processed, preexisting memories \nbecome more difficult to effectively and coherently retrieve. In the case of forced family \nseparation/disruption, parents/caregivers are expected to exhibit increasing difficulty in \nrecalling information prior to separation/disruption. In addition, repeated attempts to \nreport traumatic events in a detailed manner may exacerbate current symptoms of PTSD \nand trauma-related distress, which may be derived from child separation/disruption or \nother factors ofthe pre- and post-migration process including but not limited to insecurity \nregarding legal status and fear ofrepatriation (Schock, Rosner, & Knaevelsrud, 2015). \nThe aforementioned cognitive impairments associated with PTSD have an overwhelming \neffect on communication. Further, they have been found to negatively impact the ability \nto effectively provide comi testimony. Thus, it is expected that parents/caregivers \nexperiencing these deficits will struggle to provide detailed and coherent testimony in \nasylum proceedings. \nSigned, \nVictor Carrion, MD, Professor, Director ofELSPAP \nHilit Kletter, PhD, Clinical Assistant Professor, Director of Trauma Programs \nRyan Matlow, PhD, Clinical Assistant Professor, Director of Community Research \nPrograms \nDaryn Reicherter, Clinical Professor, Director ofHRTMH \nHelen Wilson, PhD, Clinical Associate Professor, Director of Confidential Support Team \nMichael Hamilton, MA, Graduate Student Researcher, HRTMH \nAlex Lugo, BA, Graduate Student Researcher, HRTMH \nReferences \nAinsworth, MDS, Blehar, MC, Waters, E, & Wall, S (1978).

This process \nis well coordinated. \nU.S. Customs and Border Protection \n•  CBP has reunited 522 Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) in their custody who were \nseparated from adults as part of the Zero Tolerance initiative. The reunions of an \nadditional16 UAC who were scheduled to be reunited on June 22, 2018 were delayed \ndue to weather affecting travel and we expect they will all be reunited with their \nparents within the next 24 hours.  There will be a small number of children who were \nseparated for reasons other than zero tolerance that will remain separated: generally \nonly if the familial relationship cannot be confirmed, we believe the adult is a threat to \nthe safety of the child, or the adult is a criminal alien. \n•  Because of the speed in which adults completed their criminal proceedings, some \nchildren were still present at a United States Border Patrol (USBP) station at the time \nhttps://www.dhs.gov/news/2018/06/23/fact-sheet-zero-tolerance-prosecution-and-family-reunification  1/4 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 77 of 83\n8/13/2018  Fact Sheet: Zero-Tolerance Prosecution and Family Reunification J Homeland Security \ntheir parent(s) returned from court proceedings.  In these cases, the USBP reunited the \nfamily and transferred them, together, to ICE custody as a family unit. \nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \n•  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has dedicated the Port Isabel Service \nProcessing Center (httgs:!/www.ice.gov/detention-faci lity.Lgort-isabel-service-grocessing-centerL(PI DC) \nin the San Antonio Field Office area as the primary facility to house alien parents or \nlegal guardians going through the removal process. No children will be housed at the \nfacility. \n•  PI DC is intended to serve the unique needs of detained parents and legal guardians of \nminors in HHS/ORR custody by helping to facilitate communication with their children \nand to help parents make informed decisions about their child. \n•  ICE will work with the adults to provide regular communication with their children \nthrough video teleconferencing, phone, and tablets at PI DC and other detention \nlocations where these parents are detained. \n•  Where a child is in the care and custody of HHS/ORR, ICE works with ORR to reunite the \nparent and child at the time of removal and with the consulate to assist the parent to \nobtain a travel document for the child. \n•  Once the parent's immigration case has been adjudicated by U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services (USCIS) and/or the Executive Office for Immigration Review \n(EOIR), ICE will seek to reunite verified family units and link their removal proceedings \nso that family units can be returned to their home countries together. \nICE has completed the following steps toward reunification: \n•  Implemented an identification mechanism to ensure on-going tracking of linked family \nmembers throughout the detention and removal process; \n•  Designated detention locations for separated parents and will enhance current \nprocesses to ensure communication with children in HHS custody; \n•  Worked closely with foreign consulates to ensure that travel documents are issued for \nboth the parent and child at time of removal; and \n•  Coordinated with H HS for the reuniting of the child prior to the parents' departure from \nthe United States. \nhttps://www.dhs.gov/news/2018/06/23/fact-sheet-zero-tolerance-prosecution-and-family-reunification  2/4 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 78 of 83\n8/13/2018  Fact Sheet: Zero-Tolerance Prosecution and Family Reunification 1 Homeland Security \nU.S. Health and Human Services Office of \nRefugee Resettlement \n•  Minors come into HHS custody with information provided by DHS regarding how they \ni!legally entered the country and whether or not they were with a parent or adult and, \nto the extent possible, the parent(s) or guardian(s) information and location. There is a \ncentral database which HHS and DHS can access and update when a parent(s) or \nminor(s) location information changes. \n•  As of June 20th HHS has 2,053 separated minors being cared for in HHS funded \nfacilities, and is working with relevant agency partners to foster communications and \nwork towards reuniting every minor and every parent or guardian via well-established \nreunification processes. Currently only 17% of minors in H HS funded facilities were \nplaced there as a result of Zero Tolerance enforcement, and the remaining 83% percent \narrived to the United States without a parent or guardian. \n•  Parent(s) or guardian(s) attempting to determine if their child is in the custody of the \nOffice of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) in HHS Administration for Children and Families \nshould contact the ORR National Ca[[ Center (www.acf.hhs.gov/orr!resource/orr-\nn ati on a l-ea ll-center (httR:!Iwww.acf.hhs.gov/orr/resource/orr-national-call-centerL} at 1-800-203-\n7001, or via email information@ORRNCC.com (mailto:information@ORRNCC.com)_. \nInformation will be co!lected and sent to HHS funded facility where minor is located. \nThe ORR National Call Center has numerous resources available for children, parent(s), \nguardian(s) and sponsors. \n•  Within 24 hours of arriving at an HHS funded facility minors are given the opportunity \nto communicate with a vetted parent, guardian or relative. While in HHS funded \nfacilities' care, every effort is made to ensure minors are able to communicate (either \ntelephonic or video depending on the circumstances) with their parent or guardian (at \nleast twice per week). However, reasonable safety precautions are in place to ensure \nthat an adult wishing to communicate with a minor is in fact that minor's parent or \nguardian. \n•  Minors in HHS funded facilities are permitted to call both family members and/or \nsponsors living in the United States and abroad. Attorneys representing minors have \nunlimited telephone access and the minor may speak to other appropriate \nstakeholders, such as their consulate, the case coordinator, or child advocate. \nAdditional information on telephone calls, visitation, and mail policies are available in \nthe P-Ol i cy_gu ide.

Policy.  It is the policy of this Administration to rigorously enforce our immigration laws. \nUnder our laws, the only legal way for an alien to enter this country is at a designated port of entry \nat an appropriate time. When an alien enters or attempts to enter the country anywhere else, that \nalien has committed at least the crime of improper entry and is subject to a fine or imprisonment \nunder section 1325(a) of title 8, United States Code. This Administration will initiate proceedings to \nenforce this and other criminal provisions of the INA until and unless Congress directs otherwise. It \nis also the policy of this Administration to maintain family unity, including by detaining alien \nfamilies together where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources. It is \nunfortunate that Congress's failure to act and court orders have put the Administration in the \nposition of separating alien families to effectively enforce the law. \nSec. 2.  Definitions. For purposes of this order, the following definitions apply: \n(a)  \"Alien family\" means \n(i)  any person not a citizen or national of the United States who has not been admitted into, or \nis not authorized to enter or remain in, the United States, who entered this country with an \nhttps://WWVJ.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/affording-congress-opportunity-address-family-separation/  1/3 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01938-PLF   Document 3   Filed 08/17/18   Page 82 of 83\n8/12/2018  Affording Congress an Opportunity to Address Family Separation \nalien child or alien children at or between designated ports of entry and who was detained; \nand \n(ii) that person's alien child or alien children. \n(b)  \"Alien child\" means any person not a citizen or national of the United States who \n(i)  has not been admitted into, or is not authorized to enter or remain in, the United States; \n(ii)  is under the age of 18; and \n(iii)  has a legal parent-child relationship to an alien who entered the United States with the \nalien child at or between designated ports of entry and who was detained. \nSec. J_.  TemP-orary Detention Policy for Families Entering this Country llleggJJy.  (a)  The Secretary \nof Homeland Security (Secretary), shall, to the extent permitted by law and subject to the \navailability of appropriations, maintain custody of alien families during the pendency of any \ncriminal improper entry or immigration proceedings involving their members. \n(b)  The Secretary shall not, however, detain an alien family together when there is a concern that \ndetention of an alien child with the child's alien parent would pose a risk to the child's welfare. \n(c)  The Secretary of Defense shall take all legally available measures to provide to the Secretary, \nupon request, any existing facilities available for the housing and care of alien families, and shall \nconstruct such facilities if necessary and consistent with law. The Secretary, to the extent \npermitted by law, shall be responsible for reimbursement for the use of these facilities. \n(d)  Heads of executive departments and agencies shall, to the extent consistent with law, make \navailable to the Secretary, for the housing and care of alien families pending court proceedings for \nimproper entry, any facilities that are appropriate for such purposes. The Secretary, to the extent \npermitted by law, shall be responsible for reimbursement for the use of these facilities. \n(e)  The Attorney General shall promptly file a request with the U.S. District Court for the Central \nDistrict of California to modify the Settlement Agreement in Flores v. Sessions, CV 85-4544 (\"Flores \nsettlement\"), in a manner that would permit the Secretary, under present resource constraints, to \nhttps://wvwv.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/affording-congress-opportunity-address-family-separation/  2/3 \n\n8/12/2018  Case 1:18-cv-01938-PALffFor d i nDg Coocnugrmesse ann tO 3pp  o rFtunilitey dto  A0d8d/re1s7s /F1am8i ly   SPeapagraetio 8n 3 of 83\ndetain alien families together throughout the pendency of criminal proceedings for improper entry \nor any removal or other immigration proceedings. \nSec.1_.  Prioritization of Immigration Proceedings Involving Alien Families. The Attorney General \nshall, to the extent practicable, prioritize the adjudication of cases involving detained families. \nSec. ,2.  General Provisions. (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise \naffect: \n(i)  the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or \n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, \nadministrative, or legislative proposals. \n(b)  This order shall be implemented in a manner consistent with applicable law and subject to the \navailability of appropriations. \n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or \nprocedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, \nagencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. \nDONALD J.
